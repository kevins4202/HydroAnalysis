22685,in recent tsunami events as those happened in japan in 2011 and in indian ocean in 2018 many ocean and coastal structures have been damaged tremendously seawall is one of the most important coastal infrastructures to withstand the tsunami and reduce the harm of the tsunami the investigation of the interaction between the seawall and tsunami wave is a significant aspect to reveal the influence mechanism of the tsunami and decrease the tsunami risk with this scope the effect of tsunami like wave on the seawall and sandy bed is analyzed by the coupling model of fluid and sediment modules the free surface of the fluid module is captured using vof technology the sediment transport module contains the calculation methods of sediment drift precipitation and suspension in order to guarantee the accuracy of the calculation this model is verified through the comparison between the numerical and experimental data the tsunami like wave generated according to the record in the iwate station in 2011 japan tsunami event is used to impinge the seawall after the wave overflows the seawall the sandy bed is scoured based on the force on the seawall and scour hole profile the damage energy of the tsunami like wave is assessed besides the influence of solitary wave on the seawall and sandy bed is also studied for comparison it is found that the coastal scour caused by the tsunami like wave is more serious than solitary wave with the increase of wave height the forces on the seawall and the scour depth increase when the seawall is widened the effect of the seawall on the wave reflection is enhanced however much water still can pass over the seawall the outcome of this analysis can provide a reference for the construction of the seawall and improve the understanding of the interaction between the tsunami wave and the marine infrastructures keywords tsunami like wave solitary wave seawall sandy bed sediment scour hydrodynamic force 1 introduction in the ocean due to the movement of the earth crust amount of water shakes severely which induces a series of water waves generally those water waves are described as a tsunami the propagation velocity of the tsunami wave in the ocean is greater than 1000 km h carrying much energy when the tsunami happens the seawall as the first defense barrier along the coastline plays a significant role in mitigating the risk of tsunami takagi et al 2014 for instance in 2011 although many seawalls tsunami gates large embankments are damaged significantly by japan tsunami wave and human life socioeconomic property and ecological environment suffered catastrophic damage in the tohoku region of japan the report presented that the harbor structures at kamaishi port delayed the arrival of the wave to land by six minutes and the inundation area in this zone is reduced considerably tomita et al 2012 suppasri et al 2012 however due to the understanding lack of tsunami wave and the construction restrictions of seawall the seawall is hard to block the tsunami wave completely which passes over the seawall leading to great damage of the coastal and human environment besides the seawall is also broken significantly depending on the survey of the seawall failure the results show that there are two reasons for the destruction of the seawall firstly scouring caused by overtopping flow which gives rise to loss of lateral support for the seawall fig 1 secondly the large force on the seawall due to the energy dissipation of the tsunami wave in order to design seawall that survives future tsunamis it is important to research the characteristics of the scoured region and seawall force therefore many researches about the interaction between the wave and seawall have been carried out mizutani and imamura 2001 asakura et al 2002 kato et al 2006 rajesh and choudhury 2016 studied the effects of non breaking waves on seismic stability of seawall in the investigation the dominant factors include wave profile seawall types currents and sediment scour the results indicate that the seismic stability of seawall is more sensitive to soil friction angle non breaking wave height horizontal seismic acceleration and wall fraction angle depending on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph model and ansys fluent chowdhury et al 2017 investigated the dynamic pressures imparted by regular waves on four different types of seawalls corresponding to the numerical simulation the experimental measurements are also conducted this survey reveals that the significant turbulence of flow field is related to the seawall configuration under regular wave considering the extreme marine conditions hsiao and lin 2010 researched solitary waves impinging and overtopping an impermeable trapezoidal seawall on a 1 20 sloping beach it is found that the maximum of the dynamic net wave force dnwf usually occurred at the moment when surface elevation near the seawall increases to a certain elevation liang et al 2017 applied an incompressible sph method to investigate the impact of solitary waves on movable seawalls which indicates that the seawall movement is closely related to the incident wave height except for the research about the wave impinging on the seawall the interactions between the sandy beds and flows along the seawall are also studied an analytic model was developed by ruggiero 2001 to predict the longshore hydrodynamics and sediment transport on a planar beach backed by a seawall the research shows both the longshore current and sediment transport are strongly influenced by the cross shore location of the seawall shimozono and sato 2016 studied the failure of the concrete armored levees caused by local scouring at the toe of their landward slopes that was widely observed in the 2011 tohoku tsunami in japan this investigation demonstrates that breaching is mainly caused by severe scouring at the bedside toe of the concrete armored levees as listed above research much work about the seawall under different environmental conditions have provided very valuable information mori and takahashi 2012 mikami et al 2012 arikawa et al 2012 however the research is inadequate firstly solitary waves are frequently used instead of tsunami waves to analyze the impact of the tsunami wave on the seawall and beach borthwick et al 2006 esteban et al 2014 aniel quiroga et al 2018 the two type waves are greatly different in energy and wave profile qu et al 2017 studied the influence of tsunami like wave and solitary wave on a slope which shows that the hydrodynamic strength of the tsunami like wave is larger than solitary wave secondly when the tsunami wave passes over the seawall the sandy bed is eroded behind the seawall in many studies the sandy bed is simplified as a rigid body and the interaction between the sandy bed and water is ignored the influence of tsunami wave on the deformation of sandy bed can not be analyzed in detail thirdly the research about the barrier effect of different seawalls on the tsunami wave is rare in order to make up for the deficiencies of present research the tsunami like wave is generated numerically in this research to analyze the influence of tsunami wave overtopping on the sediment scour the tsunami like wave is generated based on the record in iwate station in 2011 japan tsunami event the flow field is numerically simulated by solving the naiver stokes equations the free surface between water and air is resolved by the volume of fluid vof method a scour module is also used to estimate the deformation of sandy bed by predicting the sediment erosion advection and deposition depending on the actual project the sandy bed is set behind the seawall on one hand the impact of the tsunami like wave on the sandy bed can be estimated such as the maximum depth of sandy bed and the distance from the deepest scour point to the seawall on the other hand the influence of sediment on the water body can be analyzed to judge whether the void medium can buffer the water and reduce the damage of tsunami wave in addition the effects of different seawalls on the tsunami like wave overtopping are also analyzed such as different width seawalls and tandem seawalls this paper is mainly divided into five parts the second part mainly introduces the numerical models including the flow field module wave generation formula scour module and so on in the third part the accuracy of the model is verified by the comparison between the experimental and numerical simulation data the fourth section is the numerical simulation part in this section firstly we compare the different effects of the solitary wave and the tsunami like wave on seawall and sandy bed after waves overtopping secondly the influences of different tsunami like waves on the various seawalls and sandy beds are analyzed the fifth part makes a summary of this work and prospects for the future 2 numerical model the numerical experiments are conducted depending on the coupling model which is developed by our group in this section the modules are presented in detail including the governing formulas of fluid boundary conditions sediment transport equations and so on 2 1 flow module 2 1 1 governing equations in the numerical model the immersed boundary ib method is used and the flow region is subdivided into the meshes of fixed rectangular grids the geometric objects are embedded in the meshes by defining the fractional volumes of the objects to grids hirt and sicilian 1985 in the free surface flows the continuity and

the turbulence closure for n s equations which can predict the flow loads and scour successfully zhao et al 2010 2018 in the model the collocated finite volume method and momentum interpolation method are applied to discretize and couple the continuity and momentum equations respectively the deferred correction is employed to discretize the convective terms the diffusion and pressure terms are approximated as the central difference pressure implicit split operator piso method resolves the velocities and pressures issa 1986 the sharpness of the free surface between the water and air is controlled by the high resolution vof method stacs darwish and moukalled 2006 2 1 2 wave generation in the simulation the wave is generated at the mesh boundary in cartesian coordinate system at inlet

exactly based on the theory of n waves a combination of three sech2 wave profiles called tsunami like wave is adopted to produce the real world tsunami wave which could be written as 10 η x i t i 1 3 h i sec h 2 ω i t 0 t i the parameters for the tsunami like wave are nondimensionalized as 11 h 1 h 0 ω 1 ω 0 t 1 t 0 0 119 0 0856 6 556 h 2 h 0 ω 2 ω 0 t 2 t 0 0 328 0 0947 8 776 h 3 h 0 ω 3 ω 0 t 3

i η i h η i the observed wave profile at iwate south station the wave profile approximated by eq 10 and the corresponding solitary wave profile have been compared in fig 2 indicating that the observed tsunami wave profile is accurately represented by the combined sech2 wave which can capture the leading depression the preceding elevated and the secondary elevated wave portions very well in the computational domain the symmetric boundary conditions are implemented at the two sides of the computational domain at the end of domain the outlet boundary is applied and at the top of the domain atmospheric pressure is imposed 2 2 sediment scour module the scour module which is packed by one geometry component is fully coupled with flow module at each time step area and volume fractions of the packed sediments in mesh grids are calculated throughout the domain depending on the fractional volume method the sediment scour considers entrainment deposition bedload transport and suspended load transport in the mesh grids at the bed interface the bed shear stress the critical shields parameter the erosion rate and the bedload transport rate are calculated to determine the location orientation and area of the interface winterwerp et al 1992 soulsby 1997 brethour and hirt 2009 the scour theories of packed sediment and suspended sediment are described as follows 2 2 1 packed sediment in the simulation the first step is the calculation of the dimensionless parameter d for the critical shields number 14 d d s ρ s 1 g μ 2 1 3 where s is the ratio of sediment density ρ s to the fluid density ρ μ is the turbulent viscosity of fluid d s is the mean particle diameter of sediment in this model the dimensionless critical shields number for flat bed is computed using the equation soulsby 1997 15 θ c r o 0 300 1 1 2 d 0 055 1 exp 0 020 d at a sloping bed interface the gravity applies a tangential component of force to make the packed bed more or less unstable depending

volume concentration c s is related to c s by 24 c s c s ρ s 3 model calibration in order to ensure the simulation accuracy with regard to the present study the numerical model is verified in two aspects which are wave profile and scour hole profile 3 1 wave profile the wave profile is verified depending on the comparison between analytical and numerical data firstly when the wave propagates in a straight channel the analytical solutions are generated directly in mathematics by solving the wave elevation equations the still water depth h and wave height h are 10 m and 1 m respectively the length and height of the computational domain are 2000 m and 15 m respectively the computational mesh contains 351234 quadrilateral grids and in the wave height propagation region 30 mesh layers are laid in vertical direction in order to compare the peaks of two waves the solitary wave has been shifted to 182 s to coincide with the tsunami like wave the wave profiles recorded at x 100 m are displayed in fig 3 here the x coordinate starts from the wave generation boundary the results show that the simulation data agree well with the analytical solutions in both waves and this model can generate both waves accurately 3 2 scour hole profile to validate the calculation capability of this model in predicting the scour hole profile the scour process behind dike due to the overflow was simulated the flume experiments were performed by wang et al 2016 in the research the density of sediment is 1250 kg m3 the incoming velocity of flow is 1 09 m s the height of water surface of incoming flow is 0 049 m and the distance from the sandy bed to upper edge of the wall is 0 24 m the sediment mean particle diameter is 0 75 mm in order to ensure the resolution sufficiency of the calculation mesh model sensitivity studies are also carried out under different grid resolutions the computational domain has 562475 elements and the resolution of the finest mesh is about 1 5 mm next to the sediment layer the medium mesh and coarse mesh include 264751 and 135482 elements respectively the flow fields at different times are depicted in fig 4 which show that the scour depth increases under the effect of the overflow finally the scour reaches the equilibrium state due to the overflow injects to the water sediment layer the water body is separated into two parts and two big whirls appear in front and rear of inflow through the comparison between the simulation and experiment results the flow field and water free surface of experiment and simulation are similar to each other fig 4c and d when the scour reaches the equilibrium the scour hole profiles with different meshes and the experimental results are plotted in fig 5 it is found that the dense mesh and medium mesh provide the similar results which agree with experimental data well the resolution of dense mesh is sufficient and the meshes with similar resolution around the sediment layer in this case are used in the following studies the results indicate that this model can simulate the scour under the overflow accurately 4 results and discussions in this section the effects of the tsunami like waves on the seawalls and the sandy bed are systematically analyzed some results of which are compared with that under solitary wave the wavelength of the tsunami like wave is so long that the total length and height of the calculation domain are set as 1500 m and 20 m respectively the still water depth is 8 m and the water density is 1025 kg m3 the wave generation boundary and seawall are located at the x coordinate of 0 m and 998 m respectively the height and length of the seawall are 8 m and 1 m respectively behind the seawall the sandy bed is laid with the thickness of 8 m and the sediment mean diameter of 0 0045 m the non cohesive sediment is considered in the scour module the computational domain consists of 674 120 elements in the zone of the seawall and the seabed the spacing mesh resolution is about 0 0015 m the computational domain is gradually stretched from the working zone 900 m x 1100 m in order to analyze the hydrodynamic characteristics of the waves the gauge of water elevation is set at x 50 m and the velocity sensor is located at the point of x 50 m and z 0 085 m 4 1 comparison between solitary wave and tsunami like wave in order to fully understand the differences between solitary wave and tsunami like wave the effects of both waves on the seawall and sandy bed are analyzed in the simulation both the wave height and seawall width are 2m the solitary wave and tsunami like wave profiles recorded at wave elevation gauge are shown in fig 6 for peak comparison between two waves the water elevation of the solitary wave has been shifted to 182 s to coincide with that of the tsunami like wave we can clearly see three parts of the tsunami like wave 1 the leading depression wave portion 2 the preceding elevated wave portion 3 the secondary elevated wave portion compared with the solitary wave profile the duration of tsunami like wave is much longer with the propagation of the waves the horizontal and vertical velocities at the velocity sensor are recorded fig 7 the comparison results indicate that the horizontal velocity of tsunami like wave is larger however the vertical velocity is smaller than solitary wave besides the maximum vertical velocities of both waves are much less than the maximum horizontal velocities overall the velocity magnitude of tsunami like wave is larger than solitary wave when the wave reaches the seawall the water level recorded at x 98 m in front of the seawall is changed because when the water is blocked by the seawall the horizontal velocity of the bottom flow decreases rapidly and the vertical velocity increases which induces the increase of water level water level comparisons between the initial wave profiles and the changed wave profiles of both waves are shown in fig 8 the more the energy took by the wave the higher the wave height increases so the rising height of the water elevation under the tsunami like wave is about 1 5 m which is more than 0 4 m under the solitary wave correspondingly the higher the water level the more serious the damage to seawall when the waves pass over the seawall due to the gravity the overtopped water is falling freely and the velocity increases rapidly when the water drops on the sandy bed the velocity is more than 12 5 m s the high speed water acts on sandy bed inducing the scour hole is spreading around the water landing point figs 9 and 10 with the flux increase of the overtopped water more sediment is scoured and the scour hole becomes bigger and bigger however compared with the solitary wave fig 9 the scour under the tsunami like wave is more serious fig 10 at the time of 216 s much water accumulates around the scour hole under the tsunami like wave subsequently some backflow water climes the seawall at time of 238 s the climbing height of the tsunami like wave is higher than solitary wave which indicates that the energy of overflow under the tsunami like wave is more than the solitary wave when the scour is coming to finish there is a big vortex in the scour hole at the time of 232 s under the tsunami like wave however this phenomenon does not appear under the solitary wave after most of water flows out of the scour zone due to the residual water flows several vortexes are in the scour hole under the tsunami like wave besides the scour hole under the tsunami like wave is much bigger than the solitary wave there are three reasons leading to this difference firstly the water volume of the tsunami like wave is more than the solitary wave secondly the duration of scour under the tsunami like wave is about 25 s which is longer than 8 s under the solitary wave thirdly as shown in fig 8 before the tsunami like wave passes over the seawall the wave level is higher than that of the solitary wave namely the energy contained by the tsunami like wave is more than solitary wave overall both the characteristics of the flow and the scour hole under the tsunami like wave are more different with that under the solitary wave although much water passes over the seawall the seawall still is a great defense against the tsunami when the wave reaches the seawall the velocity of the water reduces and the flow direction reverses the contoured velocity and stream curve are drawn clearly in fig 11 the continuous stream curve which is tangent to the velocity vector at every gird in the flow field represents the flow direction after the tsunami like wave impinges on the seawall the length of the reflected wave is much long the scaling ratio 0 1 of the calculation domain height to length is adopted to show the whole reflected wave obviously due to the profiles of both waves are different the reflex effect of the seawall on both waves is also different the reflex wavelength of the tsunami like wave is much longer which means that the reflex water of the tsunami like wave is much more and the barrier effect of the seawall on the tsunami like wave is significantly serious when the waves impinge the seawall the forces on the seawall under both waves are displayed in fig 12 the forces on the seawall include hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces which have been normalized by the hydrostatic force f f ρgha 2 where a is the side area of the seawall in the initial state the seawall is only subjected to the hydrostatic force in horizontal direction which is similar under both waves when the wave arrives at the seawall the seawall mainly suffers from the horizontal force due to the leading depression wave portion of the tsunami like wave causes the decrease of the water level the force on the seawall under the tsunami like wave reduces slightly between the 170s and 195s then when the tsunami like wave is striding over the seawall the maximum horizontal force on the seawall under tsunami like wave is about 1 5 times that the solitary wave when the wave flows above the seawall the seawall suffers the vertical downward force fig 12b the maximum vertical forces under both waves are similar to each other however the force action duration of the tsunami like wave is much longer compared with the horizontal force the vertical force is much less overall the force on the seawall under the tsunami like wave is larger than solitary wave and the effect duration of the tsunami like wave on the seawall is also longer seawalls are more likely to be destroyed under the tsunami like wave after the wave passes over the seawall the seabed is scoured by the overtopped water with the increase of the water volume the scour hole becomes larger and larger fig 13 in the figure the scour depth is normalized by the still water depth and δ and ω are the ratio of the scour depth and width to the water depth respectively when the waves completely cross the seawall and the scour is finished the scour hole is the biggest the temporal evolution of the deepest scour point is shown in fig 13a before the time of 207 s the scour depth increases synchronously under both waves after 207 s the scour depth under the solitary wave decreases slightly because the backflow of the water takes some sediment to the scour hole then the scour hole remains unchanged however the scour depth continues increasing under the tsunami like wave after the 207 s when the time is 240 s the scour reaches the equilibrium the scour depth and width under the tsunami like wave are 3 5 m and 9 m respectively which are larger than 1 3 m and 8 m under the solitary wave the influence of the tsunami like wave on the sandy bed is more serious than solitary wave in conclusion at the same water depth and wave height the profile of the tsunami like wave is larger than solitary wave and the duration of the tsunami like wave is also longer when the waves propagate in front of the seawall the velocity of tsunami like wave is larger than solitary wave when the waves arrive at the seawall the water level of tsunami like wave rises higher than solitary wave after the wave passes over the seawall the water falls freely and drops on the seabed according to the gravity the water with the high velocity scours the sandy bed and the scour hole becomes bigger and bigger when the scour reaches the equilibrium the scour depth under the tsunami like wave is about 2 8 times that under the solitary wave through the comparison between two waves the forces on seawall under the tsunami like wave are larger than solitary wave which means the destructive effect of tsunami like wave on the marine infrastructure is much greater than solitary wave correspondingly some water of the wave is reflected because of the block of the seawall the reflex water of the solitary wave is less than the tsunami like wave the results indicate that there are many differences between these two type waves in other words it cannot replace tsunami like wave with solitary wave when studying the effect of tsunami like wave 4 2 different tsunami like waves on single seawall in the ocean the environmental conditions are complex and the seawalls are also varied in order to reveal the hydrodynamic characteristics and the scour under the tsunami wave overflow the effects of the tsunami like waves with different wave heights on the seawall are investigated besides the influence of solitary wave on the scour depth is also analyzed to comparing with that under the tsunami like wave in addition to h 2 0 m section 4 1 wave heights of h 1 1 5 2 5 3 3 5 and 4 m are considered respectively the wave height h of the tsunami like wave is refer to the wave height h 0 of the solitary wave when the wave heights of two type waves are the same and the width of the seawall is 2 m fig 14 depicts the wave profiles with different wave heights when the wave propagates in the water the velocity is recorded at the velocity sensor the temporal evolution pattern of the horizontal velocity is similar to the profile of the wave fig 15 a with the increase of wave height both the maximum horizontal and vertical velocities increase significantly compared with the vertical velocity the horizontal velocity is much larger for instance when the wave height is 4 m the maximum horizontal velocity of 3 7 m s is about 5 times the maximum vertical velocity of 0 75 m s so the horizontal velocity plays a decisive role in the velocity magnitude of the wave fig 15a and c with the increase of wave height the velocity magnitude basically increases linearly fig 15d the greater the velocity the more the energy contained by wave when the tsunami like waves with wave heights of 1m and 1 5m pass over the seawall the velocity contours are similar to each other figs 16 and 17 at the beginning of the overflow only little water falls on the seabed and a small hole is scoured with the propagation of the wave the wave height increases and much water contained by wave turns over the seawall due to the kinetic energy of the water body the onset of the scour happens and the water flows out the scour hole carrying much sediment and the scour hole expands rapidly in front and rear of the water landing point figs 16b and 17b after the water passes over the seawall completely the scour reaches the equilibrium and the scour hole is formed some water remains in the hole and many small whirlpools are formed although the flow characteristics of both waves are similar the water flux of the tsunami like wave with the wave height of 1 5 m is more than that under the wave height of 1 m which can refer to the cross sectional area of the falling water in figs 16b and 17b so the scour hole under water height of 1 5 m is bigger than that under water height of 1 m when the wave height is 2 5 m the velocity contours at different times are depicted in fig 18 compared with the velocity contours under the wave heights of 1 m and 1 5 m the velocity contour under wave height of 2 5m changes dramatically and the scour hole is also different as can be seen in fig 18c when the wave peak is over the seawall the water volume of overflow is very large when the water body interacts with the seabed the water breaks and a part of the water flows back to the seawall due to the water contains much energy some reflux water rises along the seawall and connects to the overflow which induces a large vortex between the seawall and the seabed except for the reflux water the other part of the water flows along the seabed both different direction flows cause the expansion of the scour hole later with the dissipation of the energy of the water the vortex disappears and the climbing water falls onto the seabed which cause the secondary scour fig 18e in the next stage due to the reduction of the volume and energy of the overflow the residual water with low velocity flows down along the seawall surface and the sediment at the bottom of the seawall is scoured seriously fig 18f and g when all the water flows out the scour hole is unchanged fig 18h the deepest scour point is at the corner of the seawall in conclusion there are two main reasons causing the difference of flow fields between fig 18 and figs 16 and 17 firstly the water volume under the wave height of 2 5m is much more than that under the wave height of 1 m and 1 5 m which induces a large reflux of the overflow under the wave height of 2 5m the reflux changes the flow characteristics and much energy is dissipated due to the interaction among the water seawall and sandy bed secondly after most of water passes over the seawall the residual water with less energy flows along the seawall surface which induces the deepest point of sandy bed is at the corner of the seawall when the height of the tsunami like wave is more than 2 5 m the flow fields are more complex and the velocity contours under the wave height of 3 m 3 5 m and 4 m are displayed in figs 19 21 when the wave height is 3 m the flow field is similar to that under the wave height of 2 5 m when the flow falls to the sandy bed the water flows in two different directions much backflow rises along the seawall and connects with the inflow a big vortex is formed fig 19b after much water is over the seawall some residual water flows along the seawall where the root is scour severely fig 19c the deepest scour point is at the corner of the seawall when the wave height is 3 5 m the wave contains much energy which is extremely unstable when the wave arrives at the seawall the peak and the profile of the wave have changed due to the block of the seawall when the wave passes over the seawall it spews out and disperses fig 20b also a strong vortex of which the height is higher than the seawall height is generated fig 20c subsequently the vortex falls on the sandy bed suddenly causing the secondary scour besides a part of water flows along the seawall and the scour happens at the bottom of seawall where the deepest point of the sandy bed is generated fig 20f when the wave height is 4 m the tsunami like wave has broken before it passes over the seawall because when the ratio of the wave height to the still wave depth is 0 5 in the process of the wave propagation the structure of water body is very unstable due to the shoaling effect the bottom water is blocked by the seawall inducing the velocities of the upper and lower parts of the wave are not uniform therefore the tsunami like wave with higher wave height is broken easily due to the block of seawall fig 21a even so due to the wave with the wave height of 4 m contains much water when it passes over the seawall a large water body is formed instead of a big vortex fig 21d when the scour reaches the equilibrium after the water flows out the calculated domain the deepest scour point is still at the corner of the seawall fig 21f when the tsunami like wave reaches the seawall the traveling wave is blocked by the seawall which will suffer the hydrodynamic forces with the wave height increasing both the water volume and velocity of the wave increase which means the wave energy increases the richer the energy of the wave the larger the force on the seawall so when the wave height increases from 1 0 m to 3 5 m both the horizontal and vertical forces consisted of hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces on the seawall increase however when the wave height is 4 m the forces decrease seriously because when the ratio of wave height to the water depth is 0 5 the shoaling effect is very significant and the wave is very unstable before the peak of the wave approaches to the seawall the wave has been broken the effect of broken wave on the seawall is rather weak therefore the force at the wave height of 4 m is much less than that at the wave height of 3 5 m fig 22 d when the overflow of the tsunami like wave flows out the calculation domain the temporal evolution of the deepest point of the sandy bed is shown in fig 23 a in the figure α is the ratio of the wave height to water depth it apparently demonstrates that the changes of the deepest points under different wave heights nearly coincide with each other with the wave height increasing the scour depth increases however the decrease gradient of the deepest point becomes larger and larger with the increase of wave height when the scour reaches the equilibrium the profiles of the scour holes under different wave heights are shown in fig 23b when the wave height is less than 2 m the deepest scour point of the sandy bed is around the water landing point and the scour hole is expanded in front and rear of the point however when the wave height is more than 2 m the profile of the scour hole changes dramatically and the deepest scour point of the sandy bed is at the corner of the seawall there are two reasons causing this phenomenon firstly the residual water of the wave flows along the seawall surface which induces the root scour of seawall secondly much reflux water around the seawall can scour this part of the sandy bed again besides when the scour is at the bottom of seawall the toppling failure of the seawall happens easily due to the instability of the root of the seawall although the profiles at different wave heights are various with the wave height increasing the depth of the scour hole increases and the scour hole becomes bigger and bigger in order to demonstrate the different influences under the solitary wave and tsunami like wave the maximum magnitudes of scour depths and widths under both waves with different wave heights are drawn in fig 24 with the wave height increasing the scour depths and widths increase however compared with the tsunami like wave the scour depth under the solitary wave increases linearly and the increased amplitude is smaller the scour depth under the solitary wave is shallower than the tsunami like wave at the same wave height the higher the wave height the greater the difference between two waves for example when the wave height is 1 m the scour depths under the tsunami like wave and solitary wave are 3 m and 2 m respectively but when the wave height is 4 m the scour depth under the tsunami like wave is about 6 5 m which is 3 25 times that under the solitary wave it also indicates that the influence of the tsunami like wave on the coast is much different with that under the solitary wave in summary when the wave height is less than 4 m with the wave height increasing the forces on the seawall increase continuously but when the wave height is 4 m the force becomes small although the profiles of the scour holes under different waves are various the scour depth and width increases and the scour hole becomes bigger and bigger with the increase of wave height 4 3 tsunami like wave on different seawalls in the coastal engineering the seawall is established according to the design criteria which is determined by the marine environment hence at different coasts the seawalls are also different to investigate the effect of the tsunami like wave on different seawalls the single seawalls with different sizes and tandem seawalls are designed and the mutual interaction among the seawall the tsunami like wave and the sandy bed is studied in this section 4 3 1 single seawall with different widths in the calculation domain the seawall widths are designed as 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 m respectively and the wave height is 2 m when the wave passes over the seawall with width of 1 m the seabed scour happens around the water landing point fig 25 with the decrease of the water volume the effect of the overflow on the seabed becomes weaker and weaker however compared with the velocity contours under the seawall width of 3 m fig 26 both the scour profiles and the flow fields change greatly the flow volume under the seawall width of 1 m is more than that under the seawall width of 3 m it demonstrates that with the increase of the seawall width the obstructing effect of the seawall on the wave is enhanced with the decrease of the overflow volume both the energy and the velocity of the overflow decrease when the wave passes over the seawall the water landing point keeps close to the seawall with width of 1 m but this point has a small movement when the seawall width is 3 m with the change of the water landing point the scour hole is expanded following the point fig 25c and the water flows violently in the scour hole which induces many different scale vortices when the scour arrives at the equilibrium the range of local scour hole under the seawall width of 1 m fig 25d is bigger than that under the seawall width of 3m fig 26d when the seawall width is 4 m the flow characteristics and the scour are similar to that under the seawall width of 3 m fig 27 when the seawall width is 5 m the temporal evolutions of velocity contours are changed again which is very different with other cases fig 28 after the wave crest passes over the seawall the water energy flow volume and velocity decrease gradually which causes the water landing point moves to the seawall in the change stage of this landing point the scour happens around the interaction point between the water and sandy bed subsequently the residual water flows along the seawall fig 28d and e because the scour position under the overflow transfers fast in the process of the water landing point movement the sandy bed is not badly scoured nevertheless at the two ends of the scour section two obvious scour holes are formed fig 28f because most of water passes over the seawall the sandy bed is scoured seriously at the water landing point and the first big scour hole is formed the second hole at the corner of the seawall is generated due to the residual water scour compared with other scour holes in different cases the range of this scour hole is much larger when the tsunami like waves impinge different seawalls the forces on the seawall are also different and the temporal evolutions of the forces are displayed in fig 29 in order to show the forces clearly the force peaks at different cases are depicted at the subgraphs fig 29a and c with the increase of seawall width the horizontal forces on the seawall are similar however the magnitudes of vertical forces increase significantly because when the water flows above the seawall with the increase of seawall width the water body on the seawall increases the bigger the top area of the seawall the larger the vertical force with the increase of the seawall width the forces on the whole seawall increase but the maximum forces on seawalls with different widths do not change significantly fig 29d when the wave overtops the seawall the temporal evolution of the deepest scour point of the sandy bed is displayed in fig 30 a with the extension of time the scour depth increases gradually and at the time of 204 s the scour depth is unchanged when the scour hole is in the stable state the profiles of the scour hole at different seawall widths are plotted in fig 30b when the seawall width is 1 m the scour hole is bigger than other holes when the seawall width is between 2 m and 5 m the shapes of the scour holes are very similar and the widths of the scour holes are smaller than that at the seawall width of 1m then when seawall width is 5 m the profile of the scour hole changes again and two different scour holes are generated on the sandy bed although the profiles of scour holes are different when the scour reaches the equilibrium the maximum scour depths are similar under different seawall widths besides the effects of the solitary wave on different seawalls are also conducted and the comparison of the maximum scour depth and width under two waves is shown in fig 31 at the same seawall width the scour hole under the solitary wave is shallower than the tsunami like wave for the tsunami like wave when the seawall width is 1 m the scour depth is the smallest and when the seawall width is over 2m the influence of different seawall widths on the maximum scour depth and width is unchanged seriously as for the solitary wave the scour depth decreases slightly with the reduction of the seawall width in summary with the increase of the seawall width the barrier effect of the seawall on the water body is enhanced and the energy took by wave is dissipated fast correspondingly the bigger the seawall the greater the force on the seawall although the profiles of the scour hole are different the maximum scour depths are similar to each other because more or less the water is reflected by the seawall but most of water still passes over the seawall and scours the sandy bed 4 3 2 tandem seawall there are two methods to reduce the damage of tsunami wave on the environment firstly reduce the amount of water over the seawall secondly dissipate the water energy before the water passes over the seawall based on these methods the tandem seawall is designed and the effect of tandem seawall on tsunami like wave is studied in the research both the wave height and the tandem seawall width are 2m the distance s between the two seawalls is designed as 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 m respectively when the distance is 1 m the snapshots of velocity contours at different times are shown in fig 32 when the wave passes over the front seawall the space between the two walls is filled by the overflow due to the mutual interaction between the tandem seawall and the water in the space a big whirlpool is generated which can reduce some energy of water fig 32b when the water passes over the rear seawall the sandy bed is scoured and a scour hole is formed behind the rear seawall fig 32c some reflux at the water landing point climbs along the seawall and then flows back to the scour hole finally the scour hole is unchanged when the distance between two seawalls is 2 m the flow phenomenon is similar to that under the distance of 1 m however due to the increase of the space between two seawalls when the wave passes over the front seawall the overflow impacts the rear seawall very obviously fig 32b and a clockwise eddy is formed the water free surface is also decreasing in the process of the wave propagation above the tandem seawall fig 33 e the snapshots of the velocity contours at different times under the distance s of 3 4 5 and 6m are plotted in figs 34 37 respectively when the wave passes over the font seawall the water hits the rear seawall directly and flows into the space between the two seawalls due to the rotation of the fluid in the space a large clockwise whirlpool is formed then the water fills the space the wave continues to move forward and passes over the rear seawall here the water free surface changes greatly the wave height decreases and a strong turbulence has occurred in the water body around the rear seawall after the wave passes over the tandem seawall the sandy bed is scoured by the water until the scour reaches the equilibrium however with the increase of the space between two seawalls the volume of water stored in the space increases the eddy becomes bigger and bigger and the turbulence of the fluid is intense which will induce the water flux and dissipate the energy of the wave due to the barrier effect of the seawall on the wave the tandem seawalls suffer the wave forces and the temporal evolutions of the forces are displayed in fig 38 in the figure χ is the ratio of the distance to the still water depth before the wave arrives at the seawall hydrostatic force impacts one side of the front seawall when the wave reaches the seawall the water passes over the front seawall and fills the space between two seawalls with the increase of the water level in the space the hydrostatic force on the other side of the front seawall increases which induces that the hydrostatic force on the whole front seawall decreases according to the force equilibrium theory except for the hydrostatic force on the seawall when the water flows in the space the front seawall is also subjected to the hydrodynamic force so in the process of the space filled by water the whole forces on the front seawall fluctuate violently when the wave passes over the tandem seawall the forces on the front wall reaches the equilibrium and the whole forces are the minimum as for the rear seawall after the wave passes over the front seawall both the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces act on the rear seawall at the beginning when the wave completely crosses the tandem seawall only one side of the rear seawall suffers the hydrostatic force and the force on the whole rear seawall is unbalanced due to the water in the space between two seawalls and the whole force on the rear seawall reaches the maximum as can be seen in fig 38 with the increase of the distance the maximum forces on the tandem seawall also increase because when the distance between two seawalls increases the space becomes bigger and bigger which induces the intensity of the water movement increase the tsunami like wave has different effects on the different tandem seawalls and the effects of the distances between two seawalls on the scour are also different when the wave passes over the tandem seawall the sandy bed is eroded and the scour holes at different cases in equilibrium are shown in fig 39 with the increase of the distance the scour hole becomes smaller and smaller however the scour holes are similar to each other there are two reasons for this phenomenon firstly the space can store a part of water but compared with the amount of water contained in the tsunami like wave the volume of the stored water is much less secondly the turbulence effect of the flow in the space on the propagation of the tsunami like wave is rather weak besides the effect of the solitary wave on the tandem seawall is also analyzed when the scour is finished the scour depths and widths under both waves are shown in fig 40 the scour depth and width under the solitary wave are much less than that under the tsunami like wave with the increase of the distance the scour depth and width under the solitary wave decreases significantly however the change of scour depth and width under the tsunami like wave is small the impact of the tandem seawall on the propagation of the solitary wave is more serious than the tsunami like wave because the water contained in the solitary wave is less than that in the tsunami like wave the space in the tandem seawall stores much water volume before solitary wave passes over the tandem seawall due to the effect of flow turbulence in the space the energy took by the solitary wave also dissipates fast so the scour depth and width under the solitary wave decrease significantly with the increase of the distance 5 conclusions the seawall is an important coastal infrastructure for resisting the wave in order to reveal the interactions among the wave the seawall and the sandy bed the effects of the tsunami like wave on the impermeable seawalls and the sandy bed are numerically studied in this paper according to the real world tsunami wave profile the tsunami like wave is generated in the coupling model of flow and sediment scour modules the scour module which includes the packed and suspended sediments is fully coupled with the flow module the differences between the solitary wave and the tsunami like wave are analyzed depending on numerical results additionally the effects of the tsunami like waves with different wave heights on the single and tandem seawalls are also considered main conclusions drawn in this research are as follows 1 compared with the solitary wave the tsunami like wave is more complex which includes three parts 1 the leading depression wave portion 2 the preceding elevated wave portion 3 the secondary elevated wave portion both the velocity magnitude and maximum forces on the seawall under the tsunami like wave are larger than solitary wave when the wave passes over the seawall the rising height above the seawall under the tsunami like wave is about 4 times that under the solitary wave when the scour is finished the scour depth under the tsunami like wave is about 2 8 times the scour depth under the solitary wave and the scour hole is also bigger under the tsunami like wave although much water of the wave passes over the seawall the seawall still is a great defense against the tsunami the effect of the seawall on the tsunami like wave is more serious than solitary wave 2 the tsunami like waves with different wave heights are employed to impinge the seawall and scour the sandy bed when the waves pass over the seawall the flow intensity increases with the wave height increasing when the wave height increases from 1 0 m to 3 5 m both the horizontal and vertical forces on the seawall increase however when the wave height is 4 0 m the forces decrease seriously because before the peak of the wave approaches to the seawall the wave has been broken after the different tsunami like waves scour the sandy bed the scour holes are roughly divided into two types one type of scour hole is close to the seawall and the deepest scour point is at the root of the seawall the other type of scour hole is far away from the seawall and there is a distance between the deepest scour point and seawall although the profiles of the scour holes are different with the increase of the wave height the scour depth increases and the scour hole becomes bigger and bigger 3 when the seawall is widened the reflection effect of the seawall on waves is enhanced and the energy took by wave is also dissipated to some extent however much water still passes over the seawall and scours the sandy bed after the waves pass over the seawall the profiles of the scour hole are different but the maximum scour depths are similar to each other because less water is reflected by the seawall when the type of seawall is tandem with the increase of the distance between two seawalls the stored water in the space increases the turbulence effect of stored water also can dissipate the energy of the water over the seawall although the tandem seawall can cause some influence on the propagation of the wave much water still passes the seawall and scours the sandy bed the scour holes under the tsunami like wave are similar to each other due to the following reasons firstly the space can store a part of water but compared with the amount of water contained in the tsunami like wave the volume of the stored water is much less secondly the turbulence effect of the flow in the space on the propagation of the tsunami like wave is rather weak compared with the tsunami like wave with the increase of the space between two seawalls the scour depth under the solitary wave decreases significantly the authors believe that the conclusions drawn from this work might provide a practical reference to the understanding of the real world tsunami wave and the hydrodynamic characteristics of the interaction between tsunami waves and seawalls which could be helpful to the design of coastal and offshore infrastructures in the engineering field in the further research it is suggested that the real world tsunami wave will be generated experimentally moreover the hydrodynamic characteristics of the interaction between tsunami waves and more complex offshore structures are worth studying acknowledgements this work was supported by the national key research and development

22685,in recent tsunami events as those happened in japan in 2011 and in indian ocean in 2018 many ocean and coastal structures have been damaged tremendously seawall is one of the most important coastal infrastructures to withstand the tsunami and reduce the harm of the tsunami the investigation of the interaction between the seawall and tsunami wave is a significant aspect to reveal the influence mechanism of the tsunami and decrease the tsunami risk with this scope the effect of tsunami like wave on the seawall and sandy bed is analyzed by the coupling model of fluid and sediment modules the free surface of the fluid module is captured using vof technology the sediment transport module contains the calculation methods of sediment drift precipitation and suspension in order to guarantee the accuracy of the calculation this model is verified through the comparison between the numerical and experimental data the tsunami like wave generated according to the record in the iwate station in 2011 japan tsunami event is used to impinge the seawall after the wave overflows the seawall the sandy bed is scoured based on the force on the seawall and scour hole profile the damage energy of the tsunami like wave is assessed besides the influence of solitary wave on the seawall and sandy bed is also studied for comparison it is found that the coastal scour caused by the tsunami like wave is more serious than solitary wave with the increase of wave height the forces on the seawall and the scour depth increase when the seawall is widened the effect of the seawall on the wave reflection is enhanced however much water still can pass over the seawall the outcome of this analysis can provide a reference for the construction of the seawall and improve the understanding of the interaction between the tsunami wave and the marine infrastructures keywords tsunami like wave solitary wave seawall sandy bed sediment scour hydrodynamic force 1 introduction in the ocean due to the movement of the earth crust amount of water shakes severely which induces a series of water waves generally those water waves are described as a tsunami the propagation velocity of the tsunami wave in the ocean is greater than 1000 km h carrying much energy when the tsunami happens the seawall as the first defense barrier along the coastline plays a significant role in mitigating the risk of tsunami takagi et al 2014 for instance in 2011 although many seawalls tsunami gates large embankments are damaged significantly by japan tsunami wave and human life socioeconomic property and ecological environment suffered catastrophic damage in the tohoku region of japan the report presented that the harbor structures at kamaishi port delayed the arrival of the wave to land by six minutes and the inundation area in this zone is reduced considerably tomita et al 2012 suppasri et al 2012 however due to the understanding lack of tsunami wave and the construction restrictions of seawall the seawall is hard to block the tsunami wave completely which passes over the seawall leading to great damage of the coastal and human environment besides the seawall is also broken significantly depending on the survey of the seawall failure the results show that there are two reasons for the destruction of the seawall firstly scouring caused by overtopping flow which gives rise to loss of lateral support for the seawall fig 1 secondly the large force on the seawall due to the energy dissipation of the tsunami wave in order to design seawall that survives future tsunamis it is important to research the characteristics of the scoured region and seawall force therefore many researches about the interaction between the wave and seawall have been carried out mizutani and imamura 2001 asakura et al 2002 kato et al 2006 rajesh and choudhury 2016 studied the effects of non breaking waves on seismic stability of seawall in the investigation the dominant factors include wave profile seawall types currents and sediment scour the results indicate that the seismic stability of seawall is more sensitive to soil friction angle non breaking wave height horizontal seismic acceleration and wall fraction angle depending on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph model and ansys fluent chowdhury et al 2017 investigated the dynamic pressures imparted by regular waves on four different types of seawalls corresponding to the numerical simulation the experimental measurements are also conducted this survey reveals that the significant turbulence of flow field is related to the seawall configuration under regular wave considering the extreme marine conditions hsiao and lin 2010 researched solitary waves impinging and overtopping an impermeable trapezoidal seawall on a 1 20 sloping beach it is found that the maximum of the dynamic net wave force dnwf usually occurred at the moment when surface elevation near the seawall increases to a certain elevation liang et al 2017 applied an incompressible sph method to investigate the impact of solitary waves on movable seawalls which indicates that the seawall movement is closely related to the incident wave height except for the research about the wave impinging on the seawall the interactions between the sandy beds and flows along the seawall are also studied an analytic model was developed by ruggiero 2001 to predict the longshore hydrodynamics and sediment transport on a planar beach backed by a seawall the research shows both the longshore current and sediment transport are strongly influenced by the cross shore location of the seawall shimozono and sato 2016 studied the failure of the concrete armored levees caused by local scouring at the toe of their landward slopes that was widely observed in the 2011 tohoku tsunami in japan this investigation demonstrates that breaching is mainly caused by severe scouring at the bedside toe of the concrete armored levees as listed above research much work about the seawall under different environmental conditions have provided very valuable information mori and takahashi 2012 mikami et al 2012 arikawa et al 2012 however the research is inadequate firstly solitary waves are frequently used instead of tsunami waves to analyze the impact of the tsunami wave on the seawall and beach borthwick et al 2006 esteban et al 2014 aniel quiroga et al 2018 the two type waves are greatly different in energy and wave profile qu et al 2017 studied the influence of tsunami like wave and solitary wave on a slope which shows that the hydrodynamic strength of the tsunami like wave is larger than solitary wave secondly when the tsunami wave passes over the seawall the sandy bed is eroded behind the seawall in many studies the sandy bed is simplified as a rigid body and the interaction between the sandy bed and water is ignored the influence of tsunami wave on the deformation of sandy bed can not be analyzed in detail thirdly the research about the barrier effect of different seawalls on the tsunami wave is rare in order to make up for the deficiencies of present research the tsunami like wave is generated numerically in this research to analyze the influence of tsunami wave overtopping on the sediment scour the tsunami like wave is generated based on the record in iwate station in 2011 japan tsunami event the flow field is numerically simulated by solving the naiver stokes equations the free surface between water and air is resolved by the volume of fluid vof method a scour module is also used to estimate the deformation of sandy bed by predicting the sediment erosion advection and deposition depending on the actual project the sandy bed is set behind the seawall on one hand the impact of the tsunami like wave on the sandy bed can be estimated such as the maximum depth of sandy bed and the distance from the deepest scour point to the seawall on the other hand the influence of sediment on the water body can be analyzed to judge whether the void medium can buffer the water and reduce the damage of tsunami wave in addition the effects of different seawalls on the tsunami like wave overtopping are also analyzed such as different width seawalls and tandem seawalls this paper is mainly divided into five parts the second part mainly introduces the numerical models including the flow field module wave generation formula scour module and so on in the third part the accuracy of the model is verified by the comparison between the experimental and numerical simulation data the fourth section is the numerical simulation part in this section firstly we compare the different effects of the solitary wave and the tsunami like wave on seawall and sandy bed after waves overtopping secondly the influences of different tsunami like waves on the various seawalls and sandy beds are analyzed the fifth part makes a summary of this work and prospects for the future 2 numerical model the numerical experiments are conducted depending on the coupling model which is developed by our group in this section the modules are presented in detail including the governing formulas of fluid boundary conditions sediment

volume concentration c s is related to c s by 24 c s c s ρ s 3 model calibration in order to ensure the simulation accuracy with regard to the present study the numerical model is verified in two aspects which are wave profile and scour hole profile 3 1 wave profile the wave profile is verified depending on the comparison between analytical and numerical data firstly when the wave propagates in a straight channel the analytical solutions are generated directly in mathematics by solving the wave elevation equations the still water depth h and wave height h are 10 m and 1 m respectively the length and height of the computational domain are 2000 m and 15 m respectively the computational mesh contains 351234 quadrilateral grids and in the wave height propagation region 30 mesh layers are laid in vertical direction in order to compare the peaks of two waves the solitary wave has been shifted to 182 s to coincide with the tsunami like wave the wave profiles recorded at x 100 m are displayed in fig 3 here the x coordinate starts from the wave generation boundary the results show that the simulation data agree well with the analytical solutions in both waves and this model can generate both waves accurately 3 2 scour hole profile to validate the calculation capability of this model in predicting the scour hole profile the scour process behind dike due to the overflow was simulated the flume experiments were performed by wang et al 2016 in the research the density of sediment is 1250 kg m3 the incoming velocity of flow is 1 09 m s the height of water surface of incoming flow is 0 049 m and the distance from the sandy bed to upper edge of the wall is 0 24 m the sediment mean particle diameter is 0 75 mm in order to ensure the resolution sufficiency of the calculation mesh model sensitivity studies are also carried out under different grid resolutions the computational domain has 562475 elements and the resolution of the finest mesh is about 1 5 mm next to the sediment layer the medium mesh and coarse mesh include 264751 and 135482 elements respectively the flow fields at different times are depicted in fig 4 which show that the scour depth increases under the effect of the overflow finally the scour reaches the equilibrium state due to the overflow injects to the water sediment layer the water body is separated into two parts and two big whirls appear in front and rear of inflow through the comparison between the simulation and experiment results the flow field and water free surface of experiment and simulation are similar to each other fig 4c and d when the scour reaches the equilibrium the scour hole profiles with different meshes and the experimental results are plotted in fig 5 it is found that the dense mesh and medium mesh provide the similar results which agree with experimental data well the resolution of dense mesh is sufficient and the meshes with similar resolution around the sediment layer in this case are used in the following studies the results indicate that this model can simulate the scour under the overflow accurately 4 results and discussions in this section the effects of the tsunami like waves on the seawalls and the sandy bed are systematically analyzed some results of which are compared with that under solitary wave the wavelength of the tsunami like wave is so long that the total length and height of the calculation domain are set as 1500 m and 20 m respectively the still water depth is 8 m and the water density is 1025 kg m3 the wave generation boundary and seawall are located at the x coordinate of 0 m and 998 m respectively the height and length of the seawall are 8 m and 1 m respectively behind the seawall the sandy bed is laid with the thickness of 8 m and the sediment mean diameter of 0 0045 m the non cohesive sediment is considered in the scour module the computational domain consists of 674 120 elements in the zone of the seawall and the seabed the spacing mesh resolution is about 0 0015 m the computational domain is gradually stretched from the working zone 900 m x 1100 m in order to analyze the hydrodynamic characteristics of the waves the gauge of water elevation is set at x 50 m and the velocity sensor is located at the point of x 50 m and z 0 085 m 4 1 comparison between solitary wave and tsunami like wave in order to fully understand the differences between solitary wave and tsunami like wave the effects of both waves on the seawall and sandy bed are analyzed in the simulation both the wave height and seawall width are 2m the solitary wave and tsunami like wave profiles recorded at wave elevation gauge are shown in fig 6 for peak comparison between two waves the water elevation of the solitary wave has been shifted to 182 s to coincide with that of the tsunami like wave we can clearly see three parts of the tsunami like wave 1 the leading depression wave portion 2 the preceding elevated wave portion 3 the secondary elevated wave portion compared with the solitary wave profile the duration of tsunami like wave is much longer with the propagation of the waves the horizontal and vertical velocities at the velocity sensor are recorded fig 7 the comparison results indicate that the horizontal velocity of tsunami like wave is larger however the vertical velocity is smaller than solitary wave besides the maximum vertical velocities of both waves are much less than the maximum horizontal velocities overall the velocity magnitude of tsunami like wave is larger than solitary wave when the wave reaches the seawall the water level recorded at x 98 m in front of the seawall is changed because when the water is blocked by the seawall the horizontal velocity of the bottom flow decreases rapidly and the vertical velocity increases which induces the increase of water level water level comparisons between the initial wave profiles and the changed wave profiles of both waves are shown in fig 8 the more the energy took by the wave the higher the wave height increases so the rising height of the water elevation under the tsunami like wave is about 1 5 m which is more than 0 4 m under the solitary wave correspondingly the higher the water level the more serious the damage to seawall when the waves pass over the seawall due to the gravity the overtopped water is falling freely and the velocity increases rapidly when the water drops on the sandy bed the velocity is more than 12 5 m s the high speed water acts on sandy bed inducing the scour hole is spreading around the water landing point figs 9 and 10 with the flux increase of the overtopped water more sediment is scoured and the scour hole becomes bigger and bigger however compared with the solitary wave fig 9 the scour under the tsunami like wave is more serious fig 10 at the time of 216 s much water accumulates around the scour hole under the tsunami like wave subsequently some backflow water climes the seawall at time of 238 s the climbing height of the tsunami like wave is higher than solitary wave which indicates that the energy of overflow under the tsunami like wave is more than the solitary wave when the scour is coming to finish there is a big vortex in the scour hole at the time of 232 s under the tsunami like wave however this phenomenon does not appear under the solitary wave after most of water flows out of the scour zone due to the residual water flows several vortexes are in the scour hole under the tsunami like wave besides the scour hole under the tsunami like wave is much bigger than the solitary wave there are three reasons leading to this difference firstly the water volume of the tsunami like wave is more than the solitary wave secondly the duration of scour under the tsunami like wave is about 25 s which is longer than 8 s under the solitary wave thirdly as shown in fig 8 before the tsunami like wave passes over the seawall the wave level is higher than that of the solitary wave namely the energy contained by the tsunami like wave is more than solitary wave overall both the characteristics of the flow and the scour hole under the tsunami like wave are more different with that under the solitary wave although much water passes over the seawall the seawall still is a great defense against the tsunami when the wave reaches the seawall the velocity of the water reduces and the flow direction reverses the contoured velocity and stream curve are drawn clearly in fig 11 the continuous stream curve which is tangent to the velocity vector at every gird in the flow field represents the flow direction after the tsunami like wave impinges on the seawall the length of the reflected wave is much long the scaling ratio 0 1 of the calculation domain height to length is adopted to show the whole reflected wave obviously due to the profiles of both waves are different the reflex effect of the seawall on both waves is also different the reflex wavelength of the tsunami like wave is much longer which means that the reflex water of the tsunami like wave is much more and the barrier effect of the seawall on the tsunami like wave is significantly serious when the waves impinge the seawall the forces on the seawall under both waves are displayed in fig 12 the forces on the seawall include hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces which have been normalized by the hydrostatic force f f ρgha 2 where a is the side area of the seawall in the initial state the seawall is only subjected to the hydrostatic force in horizontal direction which is similar under both waves when the wave arrives at the seawall the seawall mainly suffers from the horizontal force due to the leading depression wave portion of the tsunami like wave causes the decrease of the water level the force on the seawall under the tsunami like wave reduces slightly between the 170s and 195s then when the tsunami like wave is striding over the seawall the maximum horizontal force on the seawall under tsunami like wave is about 1 5 times that the solitary wave when the wave flows above the seawall the seawall suffers the vertical downward force fig 12b the maximum vertical forces under both waves are similar to each other however the force action duration of the tsunami like wave is much longer compared with the horizontal force the vertical force is much less overall the force on the seawall under the tsunami like wave is larger than solitary wave and the effect duration of the tsunami like wave on the seawall is also longer seawalls are more likely to be destroyed under the tsunami like wave after the wave passes over the seawall the seabed is scoured by the overtopped water with the increase of the water volume the scour hole becomes larger and larger fig 13 in the figure the scour depth is normalized by the still water depth and δ and ω are the ratio of the scour depth and width to the water depth respectively when the waves completely cross the seawall and the scour is finished the scour hole is the biggest the temporal evolution of the deepest scour point is shown in fig 13a before the time of 207 s the scour depth increases synchronously under both waves after 207 s the scour depth under the solitary wave decreases slightly because the backflow of the water takes some sediment to the scour hole then the scour hole remains unchanged however the scour depth continues increasing under the tsunami like wave after the 207 s when the time is 240 s the scour reaches the equilibrium the scour depth and width under the tsunami like wave are 3 5 m and 9 m respectively which are larger than 1 3 m and 8 m under the solitary wave the influence of the tsunami like wave on the sandy bed is more serious than solitary wave in conclusion at the same water depth and wave height the profile of the tsunami like wave is larger than solitary wave and the duration of the tsunami like wave is also longer when the waves propagate in front of the seawall the velocity of tsunami like wave is larger than solitary wave when the waves arrive at the seawall the water level of tsunami like wave rises higher than solitary wave after the wave passes over the seawall the water falls freely and drops on the seabed according to the gravity the water with the high velocity scours the sandy bed and the scour hole becomes bigger and bigger when the scour reaches the equilibrium the scour depth under the tsunami like wave is about 2 8 times that under the solitary wave through the comparison between two waves the forces on seawall under the tsunami like wave are larger than solitary wave which means the destructive effect of tsunami like wave on the marine infrastructure is much greater than solitary wave correspondingly some water of the wave is reflected because of the block of the seawall the reflex water of the solitary wave is less than the tsunami like wave the results indicate that there are many differences between these two type waves in other words it cannot replace tsunami like wave with solitary wave when studying the effect of tsunami like wave 4 2 different tsunami like waves on single seawall in the ocean the environmental conditions are complex and the seawalls are also varied in order to reveal the hydrodynamic characteristics and the scour under the tsunami wave overflow the effects of the tsunami like waves with different wave heights on the seawall are investigated besides the influence of solitary wave on the scour depth is also analyzed to comparing with that under the tsunami like wave in addition to h 2 0 m section 4 1 wave heights of h 1 1 5 2 5 3 3 5 and 4 m are considered respectively the wave height h of the tsunami like wave is refer to the wave height h 0 of the solitary wave when the wave heights of two type waves are the same and the width of the seawall is 2 m fig 14 depicts the wave profiles with different wave heights when the wave propagates in the water the velocity is recorded at the velocity sensor the temporal evolution pattern of the horizontal velocity is similar to the profile of the wave fig 15 a with the increase of wave height both the maximum horizontal and vertical velocities increase significantly compared with the vertical velocity the horizontal velocity is much larger for instance when the wave height is 4 m the maximum horizontal velocity of 3 7 m s is about 5 times the maximum vertical velocity of 0 75 m s so the horizontal velocity plays a decisive role in the velocity magnitude of the wave fig 15a and c with the increase of wave height the velocity magnitude basically increases linearly fig 15d the greater the velocity the more the energy contained by wave when the tsunami like waves with wave heights of 1m and 1 5m pass over the seawall the velocity contours are similar to each other figs 16 and 17 at the beginning of the overflow only little water falls on the seabed and a small hole is scoured with the propagation of the wave the wave height increases and much water contained by wave turns over the seawall due to the kinetic energy of the water body the onset of the scour happens and the water flows out the scour hole carrying much sediment and the scour hole expands rapidly in front and rear of the water landing point figs 16b and 17b after the water passes over the seawall completely the scour reaches the equilibrium and the scour hole is formed some water remains in the hole and many small whirlpools are formed although the flow characteristics of both waves are similar the water flux of the tsunami like wave with the wave height of 1 5 m is more than that under the wave height of 1 m which can refer to the cross sectional area of the falling water in figs 16b and 17b so the scour hole under water height of 1 5 m is bigger than that under water height of 1 m when the wave height is 2 5 m the velocity contours at different times are depicted in fig 18 compared with the velocity contours under the wave heights of 1 m and 1 5 m the velocity contour under wave height of 2 5m changes dramatically and the scour hole is also different as can be seen in fig 18c when the wave peak is over the seawall the water volume of overflow is very large when the water body interacts with the seabed the water breaks and a part of the water flows back to the seawall due to the water contains much energy some reflux water rises along the seawall and connects to the overflow which induces a large vortex between the seawall and the seabed except for the reflux water the other part of the water flows along the seabed both different direction flows cause the expansion of the scour hole later with the dissipation of the energy of the water the vortex disappears and the climbing water falls onto the seabed which cause the secondary scour fig 18e in the next stage due to the reduction of the volume and energy of the overflow the residual water with low velocity flows down along the seawall surface and the sediment at the bottom of the seawall is scoured seriously fig 18f and g when all the water flows out the scour hole is unchanged fig 18h the deepest scour point is at the corner of the seawall in conclusion there are two main reasons causing the difference of flow fields between fig 18 and figs 16 and 17 firstly the water volume under the wave height of 2 5m is much more than that under the wave height of 1 m and 1 5 m which induces a large reflux of the overflow under the wave height of 2 5m the reflux changes the flow characteristics and much energy is dissipated due to the interaction among the water seawall and sandy bed secondly after most of water passes over the seawall the residual water with less energy flows along the seawall surface which induces the deepest point of sandy bed is at the corner of the seawall when the height of the tsunami like wave is more than 2 5 m the flow fields are more complex and the velocity contours under the wave height of 3 m 3 5 m and 4 m are displayed in figs 19 21 when the wave height is 3 m the flow field is similar to that under the wave height of 2 5 m when the flow falls to the sandy bed the water flows in two different directions much backflow rises along the seawall and connects with the inflow a big vortex is formed fig 19b after much water is over the seawall some residual water flows along the seawall where the root is scour severely fig 19c the deepest scour point is at the corner of the seawall when the wave height is 3 5 m the wave contains much energy which is extremely unstable when the wave arrives at the seawall the peak and the profile of the wave have changed due to the block of the seawall when the wave passes over the seawall it spews out and disperses fig 20b also a strong vortex of which the height is higher than the seawall height is generated fig 20c subsequently the vortex falls on the sandy bed suddenly causing the secondary scour besides a part of water flows along the seawall and the scour happens at the bottom of seawall where the deepest point of the sandy bed is generated fig 20f when the wave height is 4 m the tsunami like wave has broken before it passes over the seawall because when the ratio of the wave height to the still wave depth is 0 5 in the process of the wave propagation the structure of water body is very unstable due to the shoaling effect the bottom water is blocked by the seawall inducing the velocities of the upper and lower parts of the wave are not uniform therefore the tsunami like wave with higher wave height is broken easily due to the block of seawall fig 21a even so due to the wave with the wave height of 4 m contains much water when it passes over the seawall a large water body is formed instead of a big vortex fig 21d when the scour reaches the equilibrium after the water flows out the calculated domain the deepest scour point is still at the corner of the seawall fig 21f when the tsunami like wave reaches the seawall the traveling wave is blocked by the seawall which will suffer the hydrodynamic forces with the wave height increasing both the water volume and velocity of the wave increase which means the wave energy increases the richer the energy of the wave the larger the force on the seawall so when the wave height increases from 1 0 m to 3 5 m both the horizontal and vertical forces consisted of hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces on the seawall increase however when the wave height is 4 m the forces decrease seriously because when the ratio of wave height to the water depth is 0 5 the shoaling effect is very significant and the wave is very unstable before the peak of the wave approaches to the seawall the wave has been broken the effect of broken wave on the seawall is rather weak therefore the force at the wave height of 4 m is much less than that at the wave height of 3 5 m fig 22 d when the overflow of the tsunami like wave flows out the calculation domain the temporal evolution of the deepest point of the sandy bed is shown in fig 23 a in the figure α is the ratio of the wave height to water depth it apparently demonstrates that the changes of the deepest points under different wave heights nearly coincide with each other with the wave height increasing the scour depth increases however the decrease gradient of the deepest point becomes larger and larger with the increase of wave height when the scour reaches the equilibrium the profiles of the scour holes under different wave heights are shown in fig 23b when the wave height is less than 2 m the deepest scour point of the sandy bed is around the water landing point and the scour hole is expanded in front and rear of the point however when the wave height is more than 2 m the profile of the scour hole changes dramatically and the deepest scour point of the sandy bed is at the corner of the seawall there are two reasons causing this phenomenon firstly the residual water of the wave flows along the seawall surface which induces the root scour of seawall secondly much reflux water around the seawall can scour this part of the sandy bed again besides when the scour is at the bottom of seawall the toppling failure of the seawall happens easily due to the instability of the root of the seawall although the profiles at different wave heights are various with the wave height increasing the depth of the scour hole increases and the scour hole becomes bigger and bigger in order to demonstrate the different influences under the solitary wave and tsunami like wave the maximum magnitudes of scour depths and widths under both waves with different wave heights are drawn in fig 24 with the wave height increasing the scour depths and widths increase however compared with the tsunami like wave the scour depth under the solitary wave increases linearly and the increased amplitude is smaller the scour depth under the solitary wave is shallower than the tsunami like wave at the same wave height the higher the wave height the greater the difference between two waves for example when the wave height is 1 m the scour depths under the tsunami like wave and solitary wave are 3 m and 2 m respectively but when the wave height is 4 m the scour depth under the tsunami like wave is about 6 5 m which is 3 25 times that under the solitary wave it also indicates that the influence of the tsunami like wave on the coast is much different with that under the solitary wave in summary when the wave height is less than 4 m with the wave height increasing the forces on the seawall increase continuously but when the wave height is 4 m the force becomes small although the profiles of the scour holes under different waves are various the scour depth and width increases and the scour hole becomes bigger and bigger with the increase of wave height 4 3 tsunami like wave on different seawalls in the coastal engineering the seawall is established according to the design criteria which is determined by the marine environment hence at different coasts the seawalls are also different to investigate the effect of the tsunami like wave on different seawalls the single seawalls with different sizes and tandem seawalls are designed and the mutual interaction among the seawall the tsunami like wave and the sandy bed is studied in this section 4 3 1 single seawall with different widths in the calculation domain the seawall widths are designed as 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 m respectively and the wave height is 2 m when the wave passes over the seawall with width of 1 m the seabed scour happens around the water landing point fig 25 with the decrease of the water volume the effect of the overflow on the seabed becomes weaker and weaker however compared with the velocity contours under the seawall width of 3 m fig 26 both the scour profiles and the flow fields change greatly the flow volume under the seawall width of 1 m is more than that under the seawall width of 3 m it demonstrates that with the increase of the seawall width the obstructing effect of the seawall on the wave is enhanced with the decrease of the overflow volume both the energy and the velocity of the overflow decrease when the wave passes over the seawall the water landing point keeps close to the seawall with width of 1 m but this point has a small movement when the seawall width is 3 m with the change of the water landing point the scour hole is expanded following the point fig 25c and the water flows violently in the scour hole which induces many different scale vortices when the scour arrives at the equilibrium the range of local scour hole under the seawall width of 1 m fig 25d is bigger than that under the seawall width of 3m fig 26d when the seawall width is 4 m the flow characteristics and the scour are similar to that under the seawall width of 3 m fig 27 when the seawall width is 5 m the temporal evolutions of velocity contours are changed again which is very different with other cases fig 28 after the wave crest passes over the seawall the water energy flow volume and velocity decrease gradually which causes the water landing point moves to the seawall in the change stage of this landing point the scour happens around the interaction point between the water and sandy bed subsequently the residual water flows along the seawall fig 28d and e because the scour position under the overflow transfers fast in the process of the water landing point movement the sandy bed is not badly scoured nevertheless at the two ends of the scour section two obvious scour holes are formed fig 28f because most of water passes over the seawall the sandy bed is scoured seriously at the water landing point and the first big scour hole is formed the second hole at the corner of the seawall is generated due to the residual water scour compared with other scour holes in different cases the range of this scour hole is much larger when the tsunami like waves impinge different seawalls the forces on the seawall are also different and the temporal evolutions of the forces are displayed in fig 29 in order to show the forces clearly the force peaks at different cases are depicted at the subgraphs fig 29a and c with the increase of seawall width the horizontal forces on the seawall are similar however the magnitudes of vertical forces increase significantly because when the water flows above the seawall with the increase of seawall width the water body on the seawall increases the bigger the top area of the seawall the larger the vertical force with the increase of the seawall width the forces on the whole seawall increase but the maximum forces on seawalls with different widths do not change significantly fig 29d when the wave overtops the seawall the temporal evolution of the deepest scour point of the sandy bed is displayed in fig 30 a with the extension of time the scour depth increases gradually and at the time of 204 s the scour depth is unchanged when the scour hole is in the stable state the profiles of the scour hole at different seawall widths are plotted in fig 30b when the seawall width is 1 m the scour hole is bigger than other holes when the seawall width is between 2 m and 5 m the shapes of the scour holes are very similar and the widths of the scour holes are smaller than that at the seawall width of 1m then when seawall width is 5 m the profile of the scour hole changes again and two different scour holes are generated on the sandy bed although the profiles of scour holes are different when the scour reaches the equilibrium the maximum scour depths are similar under different seawall widths besides the effects of the solitary wave on different seawalls are also conducted and the comparison of the maximum scour depth and width under two waves is shown in fig 31 at the same seawall width the scour hole under the solitary wave is shallower than the tsunami like wave for the tsunami like wave when the seawall width is 1 m the scour depth is the smallest and when the seawall width is over 2m the influence of different seawall widths on the maximum scour depth and width is unchanged seriously as for the solitary wave the scour depth decreases slightly with the reduction of the seawall width in summary with the increase of the seawall width the barrier effect of the seawall on the water body is enhanced and the energy took by wave is dissipated fast correspondingly the bigger the seawall the greater the force on the seawall although the profiles of the scour hole are different the maximum scour depths are similar to each other because more or less the water is reflected by the seawall but most of water still passes over the seawall and scours the sandy bed 4 3 2 tandem seawall there are two methods to reduce the damage of tsunami wave on the environment firstly reduce the amount of water over the seawall secondly dissipate the water energy before the water passes over the seawall based on these methods the tandem seawall is designed and the effect of tandem seawall on tsunami like wave is studied in the research both the wave height and the tandem seawall width are 2m the distance s between the two seawalls is designed as 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 m respectively when the distance is 1 m the snapshots of velocity contours at different times are shown in fig 32 when the wave passes over the front seawall the space between the two walls is filled by the overflow due to the mutual interaction between the tandem seawall and the water in the space a big whirlpool is generated which can reduce some energy of water fig 32b when the water passes over the rear seawall the sandy bed is scoured and a scour hole is formed behind the rear seawall fig 32c some reflux at the water landing point climbs along the seawall and then flows back to the scour hole finally the scour hole is unchanged when the distance between two seawalls is 2 m the flow phenomenon is similar to that under the distance of 1 m however due to the increase of the space between two seawalls when the wave passes over the front seawall the overflow impacts the rear seawall very obviously fig 32b and a clockwise eddy is formed the water free surface is also decreasing in the process of the wave propagation above the tandem seawall fig 33 e the snapshots of the velocity contours at different times under the distance s of 3 4 5 and 6m are plotted in figs 34 37 respectively when the wave passes over the font seawall the water hits the rear seawall directly and flows into the space between the two seawalls due to the rotation of the fluid in the space a large clockwise whirlpool is formed then the water fills the space the wave continues to move forward and passes over the rear seawall here the water free surface changes greatly the wave height decreases and a strong turbulence has occurred in the water body around the rear seawall after the wave passes over the tandem seawall the sandy bed is scoured by the water until the scour reaches the equilibrium however with the increase of the space between two seawalls the volume of water stored in the space increases the eddy becomes bigger and bigger and the turbulence of the fluid is intense which will induce the water flux and dissipate the energy of the wave due to the barrier effect of the seawall on the wave the tandem seawalls suffer the wave forces and the temporal evolutions of the forces are displayed in fig 38 in the figure χ is the ratio of the distance to the still water depth before the wave arrives at the seawall hydrostatic force impacts one side of the front seawall when the wave reaches the seawall the water passes over the front seawall and fills the space between two seawalls with the increase of the water level in the space the hydrostatic force on the other side of the front seawall increases which induces that the hydrostatic force on the whole front seawall decreases according to the force equilibrium theory except for the hydrostatic force on the seawall when the water flows in the space the front seawall is also subjected to the hydrodynamic force so in the process of the space filled by water the whole forces on the front seawall fluctuate violently when the wave passes over the tandem seawall the forces on the front wall reaches the equilibrium and the whole forces are the minimum as for the rear seawall after the wave passes over the front seawall both the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces act on the rear seawall at the beginning when the wave completely crosses the tandem seawall only one side of the rear seawall suffers the hydrostatic force and the force on the whole rear seawall is unbalanced due to the water in the space between two seawalls and the whole force on the rear seawall reaches the maximum as can be seen in fig 38 with the increase of the distance the maximum forces on the tandem seawall also increase because when the distance between two seawalls increases the space becomes bigger and bigger which induces the intensity of the water movement increase the tsunami like wave has different effects on the different tandem seawalls and the effects of the distances between two seawalls on the scour are also different when the wave passes over the tandem seawall the sandy bed is eroded and the scour holes at different cases in equilibrium are shown in fig 39 with the increase of the distance the scour hole becomes smaller and smaller however the scour holes are similar to each other there are two reasons for this phenomenon firstly the space can store a part of water but compared with the amount of water contained in the tsunami like wave the volume of the stored water is much less secondly the turbulence effect of the flow in the space on the propagation of the tsunami like wave is rather weak besides the effect of the solitary wave on the tandem seawall is also analyzed when the scour is finished the scour depths and widths under both waves are shown in fig 40 the scour depth and width under the solitary wave are much less than that under the tsunami like wave with the increase of the distance the scour depth and width under the solitary wave decreases significantly however the change of scour depth and width under the tsunami like wave is small the impact of the tandem seawall on the propagation of the solitary wave is more serious than the tsunami like wave because the water contained in the solitary wave is less than that in the tsunami like wave the space in the tandem seawall stores much water volume before solitary wave passes over the tandem seawall due to the effect of flow turbulence in the space the energy took by the solitary wave also dissipates fast so the scour depth and width under the solitary wave decrease significantly with the increase of the distance 5 conclusions the seawall is an important coastal infrastructure for resisting the wave in order to reveal the interactions among the wave the seawall and the sandy bed the effects of the tsunami like wave on the impermeable seawalls and the sandy bed are numerically studied in this paper according to the real world tsunami wave profile the tsunami like wave is generated in the coupling model of flow and sediment scour modules the scour module which includes the packed and suspended sediments is fully coupled with the flow module the differences between the solitary wave and the tsunami like wave are analyzed depending on numerical results additionally the effects of the tsunami like waves with different wave heights on the single and tandem seawalls are also considered main conclusions drawn in this research are as follows 1 compared with the solitary wave the tsunami like wave is more complex which includes three parts 1 the leading depression wave portion 2 the preceding elevated wave portion 3 the secondary elevated wave portion both the velocity magnitude and maximum forces on the seawall under the tsunami like wave are larger than solitary wave when the wave passes over the seawall the rising height above the seawall under the tsunami like wave is about 4 times that under the solitary wave when the scour is finished the scour depth under the tsunami like wave is about 2 8 times the scour depth under the solitary wave and the scour hole is also bigger under the tsunami like wave although much water of the wave passes over the seawall the seawall still is a great defense against the tsunami the effect of the seawall on the tsunami like wave is more serious than solitary wave 2 the tsunami like waves with different wave heights are employed to impinge the seawall and scour the sandy bed when the waves pass over the seawall the flow intensity increases with the wave height increasing when the wave height increases from 1 0 m to 3 5 m both the horizontal and vertical forces on the seawall increase however when the wave height is 4 0 m the forces decrease seriously because before the peak of the wave approaches to the seawall the wave has been broken after the different tsunami like waves scour the sandy bed the scour holes are roughly divided into two types one type of scour hole is close to the seawall and the deepest scour point is at the root of the seawall the other type of scour hole is far away from the seawall and there is a distance between the deepest scour point and seawall although the profiles of the scour holes are different with the increase of the wave height the scour depth increases and the scour hole becomes bigger and bigger 3 when the seawall is widened the reflection effect of the seawall on waves is enhanced and the energy took by wave is also dissipated to some extent however much water still passes over the seawall and scours the sandy bed after the waves pass over the seawall the profiles of the scour hole are different but the maximum scour depths are similar to each other because less water is reflected by the seawall when the type of seawall is tandem with the increase of the distance between two seawalls the stored water in the space increases the turbulence effect of stored water also can dissipate the energy of the water over the seawall although the tandem seawall can cause some influence on the propagation of the wave much water still passes the seawall and scours the sandy bed the scour holes under the tsunami like wave are similar to each other due to the following reasons firstly the space can store a part of water but compared with the amount of water contained in the tsunami like wave the volume of the stored water is much less secondly the turbulence effect of the flow in the space on the propagation of the tsunami like wave is rather weak compared with the tsunami like wave with the increase of the space between two seawalls the scour depth under the solitary wave decreases significantly the authors believe that the conclusions drawn from this work might provide a practical reference to the understanding of the real world tsunami wave and the hydrodynamic characteristics of the interaction between tsunami waves and seawalls which could be helpful to the design of coastal and offshore infrastructures in the engineering field in the further research it is suggested that the real world tsunami wave will be generated experimentally moreover the hydrodynamic characteristics of the interaction between tsunami waves and more complex offshore structures are worth studying acknowledgements this work was supported by the national key research and development

joints tfwjs with 135 weld toe notches the singularity length as is observed to be determined by different geometries and is summarized into concise formulas a rapid calculation method of the mode iii notch stress intensity factor nsif k 3 without any fea process is presented based on the slm good agreement is showed between the fine meshed fe the coarse meshed fe for the strain energy density sed and the proposed method six fatigue tests data of tfwjs is collected to conduct fatigue strength assessments based on the nominal shear stress and the rapidly calculated nsif k 3 the results shows the nsif k 3 can be well applied as a fatigue parameter keywords notch stress singularity length as tube flange welded joints notch stress intensity factor fatigue strength assessment 1 introduction full penetration steel tube flange welded joints tfwjs are widely used to connect tubes and plates as is well recognized geometrical discontinuities at weld toe corners always lead to localized stress concentrations which drive fatigue cracks initiating and propagating with alternating loads from sea waves cheng et al 2018 dong and guedes soares 2019 this phenomenon has brought about the study of stress distribution around the corners which is necessarily required for an accurate fatigue design of welded structures lazzarin and tovo 1996 the weld toe profiles is generally treated as a special case of sharp v notches 2 α 135 o having a notch tip radius ρ 0 with hypothesis of conventional arc welding technologies and un dressed welds lazzarin and tovo 1998 radaj et al 2006 see left side of fig 1 the earliest approach to evaluate v notches stress fields was the eigenvalue expansion of such stress fields according to the asymptotic solution by williams 1952 williams presented that in linear elastic stress field the asymptotic stress near v notch tip is singular and the singularity degree is depended on the notch angle to accurately describe the singularity of v notch stress fields gross and mendelson 1972 defined the notch stress intensity factors nsifs for in plane tensile and in plane shear stress fields at v notch tips by extending the well known stress intensity factors sifs concept for crack tips or slit tips definition of the nsif subjected to out of plane shear loading was later performed by qian and hasebe 1997 the clear analytical frame of nsifs parameters at weld toe v notches was established by lazzarin and tovo 1998 who had quantified the contributions of in plane tensile and in plane shear stress modes approximate expressions of the stress distributions around the v notches were summarized by finite element analysis fea which considered the effect of geometric sizes of welded joints and could be further applied for fatigue strength assessment however the quantitative formulas were rather complex xu et al 2013 simplified the quantitative formulas applicable to the nsif k 1 for in plane tensile stress mode i and neglected the contribution of the nsif k 2 for in plane shear stress mode ii a more comprehensive formula considering the effect of both nsif k 1 and nsif k 2 were then proposed by shen et al 2015 xu et al 2013 and shen et al 2015 focused on the planar v notches which exist only in plane tensile and shear stress as actual welded structures such as tfwjs are three dimensional and suffer from complicated loads it is essential that further researches on shear stress field and nsif k 3 mode iii of 3d v notches subject to out of plane loading should be implemented fatigue strength assessment is a critical issue for offshore structures ma et al 2018 according to the welding standards ec3 and iiw eurocode 3 2005 hobbacher 2016 the nominal stress approach is the most direct method to assess the fatigue strength of steel welded joints however it does not consider the local geometrical discontinuities at the weld toe which cause the assessment results inaccurate it is widely recognized that better accuracy can be obtained from local approaches radaj et al 2006 such as hot spot stress method fricke and kahl 2005 liu et al 2014 nsif method lazzarin and livieri 2001 lazzarin et al 2004 radaj 2014 strain energy density sed method lazzarin et al 2008 2010 radaj 2015 peak stress method psm meneghetti and lazzarin 2007 meneghetti et al 2017 these methods effectively avoid the influence of the stress singularity at the weld toe notch but it still requires the process of establishing finite element models especially for some typical welded joints it drives the demand for a more convenient estimation method for the fatigue characteristic values the nsif method was proposed to estimate not only the crack initiation life but also the total life of welded joints radaj 2014 because the vast majority of fatigue life is consumed during the crack initiation stage however the fatigue parameter nsif cannot be used for comparison between various v notch angles due to the unit differences according to williams theory williams 1952 another disadvantage is that the direct calculation of the nsif needs very refined fe meshes to obtain the stress distribution on the bisector route fischer et al 2016 to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks of the nsif lazzarin and co authors lazzarin et al 2008a b proposed the sed method based on the nsif concept the sed can be calculated over a material related control volume radius r c surrounding the weld toe or the weld root lazzarin and zambardi 2001 the radius values r c 0 28 mm for steel welded joints and r c 0 14 mm for aluminum welded joints were recommended for engineering fatigue assessment livieri and lazzarin 2005 more than 900 experiment data containing weld toe and weld root fatigue failure form various welded joints was synthesized with the sed which was unified into a δ w scatter band berto and lazzarin 2014 the sed method has been also verified for mixed loading brittle fracture for the notch componets pook et al 2016 campagnolo et al 2016 it has been confirmed that the sed is mesh insensitive and a coarse mesh is available for the sed method to assess fatigue strength lazzarin et al 2008a b rapid calculations of the nsif of welded joints can be realized by the sed from coarse meshes lazzarin et al 2010 another nsif based method psm was proposed to speed up the numerical estimation of nsif parameters with special coarse meshes meneghetti et al 2017 the advantage of the psm is that only the linear elastic peak stresses evaluated at the v notch tip are sufficient instead of a number of numerical stress results in specific route or volume the psm has been verified for uniaxial or multiaxial fatigue strength assessment of welded joints meneghetti et al 2017 2019 as mentioned above the analysis of the local stress distribution and the nsif needs extremely refined fe meshes due to stress singularity near the weld v notch which has limited the development of the nsif method the sed method can improve the calculation of nsif by relative coarse meshes but the process of fe modeling is still necessary it would be more convenient if an engineering method can determine the stress distribution and the nsif of a weld toe notch without fe processing on the other hand few attentions have been focused on the fatigue strength assessment of welded joints under out of plane shear loading in this paper a simple method singularity length method slm is proposed to estimate the shear stress distribution near v notches under mode iii loading subsequently this method is applied to predict shear stress around the weld toe of full penetration tfwjs subjected to torsion loading the predicted stress distributions are compared with the fe results to confirm the validity of the slm the analytical solution is further extended to perform rapid nsif calculation the results of the fine meshed fe coarse meshed fe for the strain energy density sed and the proposed rapid nsif calculation method are in good agreement finally a number of torsion fatigue experimental data of tfwjs is summarized statistical analysis of these data expressed in nominal shear stress range and nsif k 3 range is performed to assess fatigue strength of tfwjs 2 stress field analysis of v notch subject to mode iii loading 2 1 williams solution williams 1952 pointed out that the classical expressions which describes the singular stresses at crack tips under elastic material hypothesis can be transferred to the shape of v notches e g weld toe notches however the degree of the stress singularity is reduced and depends on the notch angle of v notches see eq 1 in a polar reference coordinate system r θ the stress field around v notch is the summation of mode i and mode ii stress fields 1 σ θ θ σ r r τ r θ λ 1 r λ 1 1 a 1 f 1 θ θ θ f 1 r r θ f 1 r θ θ λ 2 r λ 2 1 a 2 f 2 θ θ θ f 2 r r θ f 2 r θ θ where r is the distance to the v notch corner λ i is the eigenvalue defined in eqs 2 and 3 a i is the complex constant f i θ is the stress functions parameters are defined in fig 1 in the case of plane polar coordinate system r θ 2 sin λ 1 q π λ 1 sin q π 0 3 sin λ 2 q π λ 2 sin q π 0 where q is related to the notch opening angle 2 α see eq 4 4 2 α 2 π q π q 2 π 2 α π 2 2 qian hasebe s method performing similar steps as williams solution for mode i and mode ii loading qian and hasebe 1997 determined the local stress distributions subject to out of plane shear loading mode iii around the v notches see eq 5 symbols are defined as shown in fig 1 5 τ z θ τ z r λ 3 r λ 3 1 a 3 cos λ 3 θ sin λ 3 θ where 6 sin λ 3 2 π 2 α 0 the first non zero eigenvalue is 7 λ 3 π 2 π 2 α specifically for 2 α 135 o weld toe notch the eigenvalue λ 3 is equal to 0 8 by extending the definition of notch stress intensity factors nsifs proposed by gross and mendelson 1972 for mode i and mode ii stress state the mode iii nsif that quantifies the intensity of the out of plane shear stress is defined as follows 8 k 3 2 π lim r 0 τ z θ θ 0 r 1 λ 3 applying the definition 8 to eq 5 qian hasebe s formula can be presented as a function of the nsif k 3 as follows 9 τ z θ τ z r k 3 2 π r λ 3 1 cos λ 3 θ sin λ 3 θ it should be noted that mode iii is always coupled with mode ii especially near the crack 2 α 0 tips pook et al 2015 2016 however when the notch opening angle 2 α is large than 102 6 the mode ii stress distribution is no longer singular radaj 2014 the fatigue failure of tfwjs can be associated only with the mode i and mode iii stress distribution neglecting the effect of mode ii stress lazzarin et al 2004 so the torsion loading on tfwjs is considered to cause only mode iii stress in this study 2 3 an improved approach singularity length method lazzarin and tovo 1998 researched the scale effect of nsif values found out that nifs can be expressed in terms of non dimensional quantities as follows 10 k i k i ref d 1 λ i ref d 1 λ i where k i ref i 1 2 3 are the nifs determined for a reference geometry with a reference geometrical dimension equalling to d ref for instance d ref could be the thickness of the principal plate in tfwjs where λ i i 1 2 3 are the eigenvalues depending on the notch angle 2 α the k i ref d 1 λ i ref in eq 10 is dimensionally a stress it can be expressed as a reference stress σ 0 so that when the considered welded attachment is subjected to uniaxial loading eq 10 can be rewritten as eq 11 11 k 3 k 3 τ 0 t 1 λ 3 where τ 0 is the remotely applied nominal torsion stress referring to the maximum shear stress at the outer surface of the tube for tfwjs it is defined as eq 15 t is the thickness of the main plate of welded joints for instance the tube thickness of tfwjs k 3 are non dimensional parameters which depend on overall welded detail geometry and loading types when it comes to a typical tfwj under torsion loading k 3 is a function of three principal geometric parameters namely h the weld size t thickness of the tube and l thickness of the flange geometric parameters are shown in fig 2 b note that g r 1 means the flange is solid therefore according to above equations the shear stress distribution of mode iii around the weld toe v notch can be described as 12 τ z θ τ 0 2 π 1 x 1 λ 3 f h t l f h t l 1 1 λ 3 θ θ 1 1 λ 3 t 1 λ 3 where x is the distance to the notch corner see fig 2 f 1 h t l is a function of h t l λ 3 can be computed by eq 7 for a given v notch angle 2 α at a given direction θ parameter λ 3 and cos λ 3 θ can be seen as constants and π is a fixed value taking all the constants into f 1 h t l a new function can be defined as 13 h t l f 1 h t l h t l 1 1 λ 3 cos λ 3 θ θ 1 1 λ 3 t π 1 2 1 λ 3 to simplify the calculation a new equivalent parameter as a s f 2 h t l is employed then eq 12 can be simplified as follows 14 τ z θ τ 0 2 a s x 1 λ 3 obviously the equivalent parameter as directly affects the singularity degree of the shear stress distribution meanwhile as has a unit of length its unit should be the same with the distance x so as can be regarded as a characteristic length of the singularity and is named singularity length in next section an approximate formula of as for tfwjs under torsion loading is carried out the shear stress distribution can be conveniently estimated by eq 14 when the geometric parameters are known to determine as value similarly this simple stress estimation method is named as singularity length method slm 3 numerical analysis 3 1 fe modeling linear elastic fe analysis is performed by the finite element software ansys among the ansys element library a special four node two dimensional and harmonic axisymmetric element plane 25 is adopted this employed element type is capable of simulating axisymmetric structures with external loads not necessarily axisymmetric which must be defined as a series of harmonic functions fourier series therefore plane 25 is chosen for modeling three dimensional axisymmetric components subjected to torsion loading keeping the advantage of building two dimensional fe models fig 3 shows an example of 2d fe model in terms of a tfwj the model is axisymmetric around the y axis as the flange is usually bolted in fatigue test and engineering use fixed constraints are assumed at the back face of the flange for fea see left end of the flange in fig 3 for steel the poisson s ratio v is 0 3 and the young modulus e is 206 gpa the nominal torsion stress applied at the right end of tube is set as 1 mpa and the nominal torsion stress of tube is defined by the following classical expression 15 τ 0 m t w t m t π 16 2 r 2 t 4 2 r i 2 r 2 t 4 where r is the inner radius and t is the tube thickness see fig 2b since stress concentration at the v notch corner is very serious so that an extremely fine mesh is required nearby the weld toe while coarser mesh is chosen at the other parts the mesh convergence study is conducted to ensure the accuracy of the fe results the degree of refinement close to the corner is determined by the spacing ratio set in the ansys software the spacing ratio is the ratio of the maximum mesh size to the minimum one on a path or line where the mesh sizes are changed in gradient the stress distributions along the x line see fig 2b adopting different mesh sizes are presented in fig 4 it can be seen that the shear stress distributions are essentially unchanged when the minimum mesh size is 5 10 3 mm or smaller considering the balance of simulation accuracy and acceptable computational cost the minimum mesh size at the notch corner is set to 10 4 mm in the following fe analysis see enlarged scale in fig 3 3 2 parametric study the geometrical parameters of a typical tfwj are defined in fig 2b a series of finite element analysis are employed by using ansys parametric design language apdl aiming to determine the contribution of each parameter to the shear stress distribution in the vertical direction of the tube see x line in fig 2b the ranges of geometrical parameters values correspond to the actual structure sizes the length of the tube l is set as a relatively large value to ensure providing uniform stress field near the notch corner from engineering view the flange thickness l the weld size h and the tube thickness t would affect the stress concentration at the weld toe while other parameters the outer flange length h and the tube inner radius r have little influence on the stress distribution therefore the influences of parameters l thickness of the flange h the weld size and t thickness of the tube on shear stress distribution are discussed by keeping other parameters as constant see fig 5 in view of the engineering range 0 l t 3 0 and 0 h t 4 the value of l is changed from 0 5 cm to 3 cm the value of h is changed from 0 5 cm to 4 cm and the value of t is changed from 1 cm to 4 cm the following conclusions can be revealed 1 the tube thickness t plays a dominant role on the notch shear stress with the increase of t the stress distribution is obviously enhanced 2 the influence of h depends on the value of l and t the stress distribution has almost no change as h increases when t is small while the increase of h enlarges the stress distribution in condition of large t comparing fig 5a l 0 5 cm fig 5b l 2 cm and fig 5c l 3 cm it can be concluded that smaller l makes the effect of h more remarkable on the shear stress distribution 3 3 approximate formulas of as according to the analysis in section 3 2 three main parameters t h and l are considered as the major controllable variables to determine the equivalent parameter as varying t h and l among the engineering parameters ranges 168 fe models are conducted to obtain corresponding shear stress distribution in the direction of tube thickness see x line in fig 2b partial results have been presented in fig 5 the detailed dimensions of these fe models are summarized in table 1 fe results provide discrete data of the stress value τ z θ and the distance from the corner x the eigenvalue λ 3 is 0 8 for 135 weld toe notch therefore the parameter as can be well determined by processing such data in matlab software with eq 14 using nonlinear least squares fitting method the fitting results t 2 m are shown in table 2 it can be seen there is a function relation between l h and t and the corresponding fitting value of as as demonstrated in fig 6 two cases of g r 0 hollow flange and g r 1 solid flange are respectively considered when fitting as formula with parameter l h and t when the value of h l is small the influence of h is invisible and can be neglected the as formula can be obtained according to the other two parameters l and t however with a large value of h l a big size of the weld size h enhances the local stress concentration at the corner the formula needs to contain the obvious effect of h the analysis of fig 6 reveals that as is determined by two approximate formulas the smaller of calculated values of these two formulas is closer to the fitting as from fea therefore estimation formulas of as for tfwjs under torsion loading can be deduced as following simple form 16a a s g r 0 min 0 09 l 0 9 t 0 2 l h 0 1 t t h 0 9 16b a s g r 1 min 0 9 0 09 l 0 9 t 0 9 0 2 l h 0 1 t t h 0 9 for convenience and sufficinet accuracy the approximate formula of g r 0 is set to 0 9 times the formula of g r 1 fig 7 presents the errors of as values between the estimation formulas and fitting results of fea most errors are less than 10 and only case holds the largest error of 21 it can be concluded that the approximate formulas eq 16 can estimate as values with satisfactory accuracy for practical aspects in engineering it is useful to note that the similarity of stresses is contained in as formulas if two similar geometries are scaled by factor d i e the absolute dimension of case b is d times as large as that of case a the parameter as can be seen as a function linearly related to the whole geometry size when the boundary conditions on external forces and displacements are the same the following relations can be derived from eq 14 17 τ z θ b x τ 0 2 a s b x 1 λ 3 τ 0 2 d a s a x 1 λ 3 τ 0 2 a s a x d 1 λ 3 τ z θ a x d τ z θ a x τ z θ b d x 4 verification of singularity length method when the geometric dimensions of a tfwj are known the as value can be rapidly computed by eq 16 then substituting as into eq 14 the shear stresses along the x line see fig 2b can be obtained this is the process how singularity length method slm determines the shear stress distribution to verify the capability of the method shear stress distributions near the toe corner 0 100 mm derived from the slm and the fe results are compared via four examples as shown in fig 8 g r 0 and fig 9 g r 1 the following can be concluded 1 figs 8a and 9a show the cases with the largest as error between the formula eq 16 and the fitting value while even in these two worst cases the shear stresses errors between slm and fea results are less than 6 moreover the stress errors are within 5 or smaller in other cases it can be drawn that the slm has good performance on shear stress estimation near the weld toe corner 2 the shear stress decreases rapidly away from the corner specially when the distance from the corner equals to as 200 the shear stress reduces to about twice the nominal shear stress 2 τ n o m this phenomenon can be explained by substituting x as 200 into eq 14 the shear stress is 18 τ z θ τ 0 2 a s x 1 λ 3 τ 0 2 200 0 2 2 04 τ 0 2 τ 0 similarly it can be inferred that when the distance x as 5 5 the shear stress τ z θ is about equal to the nominal shear stress τ n o m 5 rapid nsif calculation it is widely recognized that nsifs can be employed as fatigue parameter for life prediction of cyclically loaded welded joints with v notch corners lazzarin and tovo 1998 fischer et al 2016 however the computation of exact nsif requires extremely refined finite element mesh where a row of finite element nodes must be along the notch bisector line and the mesh size around the notch tip need to be adjusted around 10 4 mm meneghetti 2013 as the concise formulas of as for thwjs has been established it is feasible to rapidly calculate the mode iii nsif k 3 without any fe process by transforming the formulas in the slm based on eq 9 and eq 14 the mode iii nsif can be expressed as 19 k 3 2 π τ θ z r λ 3 1 cos λ 3 θ π τ 0 a s 1 λ 3 cos λ 3 θ for a tfwj with a 135 notch opening angle λ 3 0 8 θ 22 5 0 the nsif k 3 becomes 20 k 3 π cos 0 1 π a s 0 2 τ 0 1 864 a s 0 2 τ 0 where as can be directly determined by eq 16 lazzarin and tovo 1998 employed fine meshed fe models to directly evaluate the mode i and ii components of nsif according to their method the nsif k 3 can be obtained in the same way fig 10 shows a typical fe model of a tfwj l 1 cm h 0 5 cm t 1 cm g r 1 to compute nsif k 3 and the mesh detail of the notch tip order of magnitude of the smallest mesh size equals to 10 4 mm two dimensional element plane 25 is employed to simplify the modeling process according to the nsif k 3 definition eq 8 any shear stress value along the bisector but adequately close to the weld toe corner can be used to determine the nsif the shear stresses and the corresponding distance r j of the nodes along the bisector line are taken into account at each node j the mode iii nsif can be computed as follows 21 k 3 j 2 π τ z θ j r j 1 λ 3 all these nodes provide the nsif values by means of eq 21 as shown by the red line in fig 10 the shear stress distribution of the nodes near the corner is nearly linear in a log log plot there is a large stability zone ranging from about 10 4 r t to 10 1 r t where the analysis gives a constant and well defined value for nsif k 3 however it is very complicated to conduct the process of fine meshed fe method when applying the eq 20 it becomes much easier to gain the value of nsif k 3 based on the closed form expressions correlating nsifs and local strain energy density sed of sharp notches the nsifs can be rapidly calculated from the sed on a control volume around the weld toe since coarse meshes can provide sufficiently accurate sed lazzarin et al 2010 under pure mode iii loading the link between local sed and k 3 can be expressed as follow lazzarin et al 2008a b 22 w e 3 e k 3 r c 1 λ 3 2 it gives 23 k 3 r c 1 λ 3 e w e 3 691 91 w where e is the young s modulus parameter e 3 depends on the notch angle 2 α and the poisson s ratio v for 2 α 135 o and v 0 3 e 3 is found to be 0 2586 lazzarin et al 2008a b rc is the radius of the control volume it turns out to be 0 28 mm for welded joints in mild steels livieri and lazzarin 2005 the coarse meshes used to obtain the local sed of tfwjs are referring to the literature lazzarin et al 2010 fig 11 shows overall meshes of an fe example at the weld toe the control volume is a circle of radius 0 28 mm embedded in a square with 4 mm sides to compare aforementioned three nsif calculation methods fine meshed fe coarse meshed fe for sed and eq 20 six typical tfwj geometry sizes are investigated here the external load is assumed as torsion loading with nominal torsion stress 1 mpa for convenience the comparison results are summarized in table 3 the fine meshed fe results are taken as the reference the errors varies from 4 21 to 5 16 for coarse meshed fe and are within 2 for eq 20 both the coarse meshed fe method and the proposed analytical solution eq 20 have good performance on rapid nsif calculation it demonstrates that the nsif k 3 of tfwjs can be rapidly calculated though the proposed analytical solution having an advantage of very simple expressions eq 20 and eq 16 without any fe processing 6 fatigue strength assessment the most common way to assess and to design the fatigue strength of welded joints is using the reference s n curves based on the nominal stress range which are divided into different fatigue classes fat express in mpa of the fatigue strength at 2 million cycles curves for various structural details hobbacher 2016 these fatigue strength curves are linear in the double logarithm coordinate which can be defined as following expressions 24 log n log c d σ k log s where n is the predicted fatigue life cycles under the stress range s c is a constant whose value is specific to each structural detail σ is the standard deviation of log n d is the number of the standard deviation and d equals to 2 below the mean curve for safe fatigue design with 97 7 survival probability k is the inverse slope of s n curve the iiw international institute of welding and ec3 eurocode 3 2005 standards provide several fat s n curves for various welded structural details under direct or normal stress ranges difference between maximum and minimum value however for shear stress ranges the fatigue phenomena are less concerned and there is no well defined constant amplitude fatigue limit the standards just provide a unique s n curve fat 100 k 5 for toe fatigue failure of steel welded joints on the basis of the shear stress range the approach based on notch stress intensity factor nsif naturally takes the influence of weld toe detail and the scale effect into account and has been considered to be more accurate than the nominal stress approach fischer et al 2016 livieri and lazzarin 2005 systematically analyzed large amount of fatigue tests data under tension or bending loading using the nsif approach proposed a design mean curve and corresponding scatter bound of mode i nsif for welded joints however fatigue strength assessment under shear stress ranges which is related to the mode iii nsif is also ambiguous in order to assess the fatigue strength of welded joints in alternating shear stress state and to validate the application of rapid nsif calculation for fatigue strength assessment at the same time six series of fatigue test data concerning tfwj specimens subjected to pure torsion have been summarized from the literature all specimens are made of structural steels table 4 and fig 12 report the main geometry sizes and fatigue loading conditions of the specimens note that the round or square flange would make no difference according to the parametric study in section 3 2 for all specimens a weld toe angle equalling to 135 is assumed the same as that in the theory and numerical analysis in the previous sections moreover considering the worst case of un dressed welding in all fatigue specimens the weld toe cross section is a pointed v notch with zero radius all selected specimens are under pure torsion loading mode iii loading and their failure location are at the weld toe fig 13 shows all summarized fatigue tests results expressed in nominal shear stress range according to the iiw and ec3 standards fat 100 curve is recommended for these data it is obvious that the design curve of standards is very safe but too conservative especially in high cycle region to be more accurate statistical analysis has been conducted with the same tests data s n curves with ps survival probability 2 3 and 97 7 i e mean curve two standard deviations are demonstrated in fig 13 at the reference 2 million cycles n a 2 10 6 cycles the fatigue strength δ τ with survival probability of 97 7 is 138 mpa which is much higher than the recommended value 100 mpa fat 100 the inverse slope of the fatigues curves is 6 6 and the scatter index defined by eq 25 is 1 84 25 t σ δ τ n a p s 2 3 δ τ n a p s 97 7 a rapid calculation method for nsif k 3 has been established in the section 5 fig 14 shows the fatigue data expressed in rapidly calculated nsif k 3 range statistical analysis of these nsif values has been carried out with k n curves k n curve can be defined as eq 26 referring to the basic s n curve expression the mean value of δ k 3 at n a 2 10 6 cycles is 136 mpa m0 2 the scatter index t k is 1 83 and the inverse slope of k n curves is 6 7 both values are close to the analysis results of the nominal shear stress range one possible reason may explain the phenomenon the available experiment data provides a small change of tube thicknesses 7 mm 10mm and weld sizes 6 3 mm 10mm which means each test specimen have similar size effect it shows that mode iii nsif can be applied for fatigue strength assessment of tfwjs under torsion loading 26 log n log c k d σ k log k furthermore modified k n curves with a uniform scatter index and curve slope would be more practical in fatigue design fig 15 shows the proposed design k n curves the proposed inverse slope k is 5 00 according to the inverse slope of s n curve for shear stress ranges in standards the proposed scatter index with survival probabilities 2 3 97 7 is 1 90 which is consistent with the scatter index t 1 50 with survival probabilities of 10 90 determined by haibach 1989 the mean fatigue strength at na is 120 mpa m0 2 it can be seen that the proposed design k n curves are quite suitable for the tests data with satisfactory accuracy the k n curve with survival probability of 97 7 can be employed for safe fatigue design of steel tfwjs by the fatigue parameter δ k 3 based on eq 26 this curve can be expressed as following simple form 27 log n 5 log k 3 16 7 conclusions a brief method named singularity length method slm is introduced to determine the shear stress distribution at the v notch corner subject to mode iii loading the key of slm is the equivalent parameter as named singularity length which directly relates to the stress singularity and physically has a unit of length for tube flange welded joints tfwjs under torsion loading as is expressed as formulas of three main geometric parameters though a series of finite element analysis thus the shear stress distribution near the weld toe corner can be easily estimated by eq 14 for known dimensions of a tfwj following this the rapidly calculated formula eq 20 of the mode iii nsif is derived based on the slm six series of fatigue tests data of tfwjs under pure torsion are employed for fatigue strength assessments based on the nominal shear stress range and the rapidly calculated mode iii nsif range the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the shear stress distribution around weld toe corner predicted by the slm is in good agreement with the fe results for tfwjs under torsion loading among all the geometric parameters of tfwjs thickness of the flange l the weld size h and thickness of the tube t play the dominant role on the shear stress distribution 2 comparison of nsif k 3 calculations shows excellent agreement between the fine meshed fe the coarse meshed fe for sed and proposed analytical solution eq 20 3 fatigue assessment of the employed test data indicates that the design s n curve in the standards is too conservative and the mode iii nsif is well applied for fatigue strength assessment of tfwjs for practical fatigue design modified k n curves with a uniform scatter index and curve slope are further proposed and the lower curve used for safe fatigue design has a

22686,a simple method named singularity length method slm with a key parameter singularity length as is proposed to estimate the shear stress distribution at the v notch corner for tube flange welded joints tfwjs with 135 weld toe notches the singularity length as is observed to be determined by different geometries and is summarized into concise formulas a rapid calculation method of the mode iii notch stress intensity factor nsif k 3 without any fea process is presented based on the slm good agreement is showed between the fine meshed fe the coarse meshed fe for the strain energy density sed and the proposed method six fatigue tests data of tfwjs is collected to conduct fatigue strength assessments based on the nominal shear stress and the rapidly calculated nsif k 3 the results shows the nsif k 3 can be well applied as a fatigue parameter keywords notch stress singularity length as tube flange welded joints notch stress intensity factor fatigue strength assessment 1 introduction full penetration steel tube flange welded joints tfwjs are widely used to connect tubes and plates as is well recognized geometrical discontinuities at weld toe corners always lead to localized stress concentrations which drive fatigue cracks initiating and propagating with alternating loads from sea waves cheng et al 2018 dong and guedes soares 2019 this phenomenon has brought about the study of stress distribution around the corners which is necessarily required for an accurate fatigue design of welded structures lazzarin and tovo 1996 the weld toe profiles is generally treated as a special case of sharp v notches 2 α 135 o having a notch tip radius ρ 0 with hypothesis of conventional arc welding technologies and un dressed welds lazzarin and tovo 1998 radaj et al 2006 see left side of fig 1 the earliest approach to evaluate v notches stress fields was the eigenvalue expansion of such stress fields according to the asymptotic solution by williams 1952 williams presented that in linear elastic stress field the asymptotic stress near v notch tip is singular and the singularity degree is depended on the notch angle to accurately describe the singularity of v notch stress fields gross and mendelson 1972 defined the notch stress intensity factors nsifs for in plane tensile and in plane shear stress fields at v notch tips by extending the well known stress intensity factors sifs concept for crack tips or slit tips definition of the nsif subjected to out of plane shear loading was later performed by qian and hasebe 1997 the clear analytical frame of nsifs parameters at weld toe v notches was established by lazzarin and tovo 1998 who had quantified the contributions of in plane tensile and in plane shear stress modes approximate expressions of the stress distributions around the v notches were summarized by finite element analysis fea which considered the effect of geometric sizes of welded joints and could be further applied for fatigue strength assessment however the quantitative formulas were rather complex xu et al 2013 simplified the quantitative formulas applicable to the nsif k 1 for in plane tensile stress mode i and neglected the contribution of the nsif k 2 for in plane shear stress mode ii a more comprehensive formula considering the effect of both nsif k 1 and nsif k 2 were then proposed by shen et al 2015 xu et al 2013 and shen et al 2015 focused on the planar v notches which exist only in plane tensile and shear stress as actual welded structures such as tfwjs are three dimensional and suffer from complicated loads it is essential that further researches on shear stress field and nsif k 3 mode iii of 3d v notches subject to out of plane loading should be implemented fatigue strength assessment is a critical issue for offshore structures ma et al 2018 according to the welding standards ec3 and iiw eurocode 3 2005 hobbacher 2016 the nominal stress approach is the most direct method to assess the fatigue strength of steel welded joints however it does not consider the local geometrical discontinuities at the weld toe which cause the assessment results inaccurate it is widely recognized that better accuracy can be obtained from local approaches radaj et al 2006 such as hot spot stress method fricke and kahl 2005 liu et al 2014 nsif method lazzarin and livieri 2001 lazzarin et al 2004 radaj 2014 strain energy density sed method lazzarin et al 2008 2010 radaj 2015 peak stress method psm meneghetti and lazzarin 2007 meneghetti et al 2017 these methods effectively avoid the influence of the stress singularity at the weld toe notch but it still requires the process of establishing finite element models especially for some typical welded joints it drives the demand for a more convenient estimation method for the fatigue characteristic values the nsif method was proposed to estimate not only the crack initiation life but also the total life of welded joints radaj 2014 because the vast majority of fatigue life is consumed during the crack initiation stage however the fatigue parameter nsif cannot be used for comparison between various v notch angles due to the unit differences according to williams theory williams 1952 another disadvantage is that the direct calculation of the nsif needs very refined fe meshes to obtain the stress distribution on the bisector route fischer et al 2016 to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks of the nsif lazzarin and co authors lazzarin et al 2008a b proposed the sed method based on the nsif concept the sed can be calculated over a material related control volume radius r c surrounding the weld toe or the weld root lazzarin and zambardi 2001 the radius values r c 0 28 mm for steel welded joints and r c 0 14 mm for aluminum welded joints were recommended for engineering fatigue assessment livieri and lazzarin 2005 more than 900 experiment data containing weld toe and weld root fatigue failure form various welded joints was synthesized with the sed which was unified into a δ w scatter band berto and lazzarin 2014 the sed method has been also verified for mixed loading brittle fracture for the notch componets pook et al 2016 campagnolo et al 2016 it has been confirmed that the sed is mesh insensitive and a coarse mesh is available for the sed method to assess fatigue strength lazzarin et al 2008a b rapid calculations of the nsif of welded joints can be realized by the sed from coarse meshes lazzarin et al 2010 another nsif based method psm was proposed to speed up the numerical estimation of nsif parameters with special coarse meshes meneghetti et al 2017 the advantage of the psm is that only the linear elastic peak stresses evaluated at the v notch tip are sufficient instead of a number of numerical stress results in specific route or volume the psm has been verified for uniaxial or multiaxial fatigue strength assessment of welded joints meneghetti et al 2017 2019 as mentioned above the analysis of the local stress distribution and the nsif needs extremely refined fe meshes due to stress singularity near the weld v notch which has limited the development of the nsif method the sed method can improve the calculation of nsif by relative coarse meshes but the process of fe modeling is still necessary it would be more convenient if an engineering method can determine the stress distribution and the nsif of a weld toe notch without fe processing on the other hand few attentions have been focused on the fatigue strength assessment of welded joints under out of plane shear loading in this paper a simple method singularity length method slm is proposed to estimate the shear stress distribution near v notches under mode iii loading subsequently this method is applied to predict shear stress around the weld toe of full penetration tfwjs subjected to torsion loading the predicted stress distributions are compared with the fe results to confirm the validity of the slm the analytical solution is further extended to perform rapid nsif calculation the results of the fine meshed fe coarse meshed fe for the strain energy density sed and the proposed rapid nsif calculation method are in good agreement finally a number of torsion fatigue experimental data of tfwjs is summarized statistical analysis of these data expressed in nominal shear stress range and nsif k 3 range is performed to assess fatigue strength of tfwjs 2 stress field analysis of v notch subject to mode iii loading 2 1 williams solution williams 1952 pointed out that the classical expressions which describes the singular stresses at crack tips under elastic material hypothesis can be transferred to the shape of v notches e g weld toe notches however the degree of the stress singularity is reduced and depends on the notch angle of v notches see eq 1 in a polar reference coordinate system r θ the stress field around v notch is the summation of mode i and mode ii stress fields 1 σ θ θ σ r r τ r θ λ 1 r λ 1 1 a 1 f 1 θ θ θ f 1 r r θ f 1 r θ θ λ 2 r λ 2 1 a 2 f 2 θ θ θ f 2 r r θ f 2 r θ θ where r is the distance to the v notch corner λ i is the eigenvalue defined in eqs 2 and 3 a i is the complex constant f i θ is the stress functions parameters are defined in fig 1 in the case of plane polar coordinate system r θ 2 sin λ 1 q π λ 1 sin q π 0 3 sin λ 2 q π λ 2 sin q π 0 where q is related to the notch opening angle 2 α see eq 4 4 2 α 2 π q π q 2 π 2 α π 2 2 qian hasebe s method performing similar steps as williams solution for mode i and mode ii loading qian and hasebe 1997 determined the local stress distributions subject to out of plane shear loading mode iii around the v notches see eq 5 symbols are defined as shown in fig 1 5 τ z θ τ z r λ 3 r λ 3 1 a 3 cos λ 3 θ sin λ 3 θ where 6 sin λ 3 2 π 2 α 0 the first non zero eigenvalue is 7 λ 3 π 2 π 2 α specifically for 2 α 135 o weld toe notch the eigenvalue λ 3 is equal to 0 8 by extending the definition of notch stress intensity factors nsifs proposed by gross and mendelson 1972 for mode i and mode ii stress state the mode iii nsif that quantifies the intensity of the out of plane shear stress is defined as follows 8 k 3 2 π lim r 0 τ z θ θ 0 r 1 λ 3 applying the definition 8 to eq 5 qian hasebe s formula can be presented as a function of the nsif k 3 as follows 9 τ z θ τ z r k 3 2 π r λ 3 1 cos λ 3 θ sin λ 3 θ it should be noted that mode iii is always coupled with mode ii especially near the crack 2 α 0 tips pook et al 2015 2016 however when the notch opening angle 2 α is large than 102 6 the mode ii stress distribution is no longer singular radaj 2014 the fatigue failure of tfwjs can be associated only with the mode i and mode iii stress distribution neglecting the effect of mode ii stress lazzarin et al 2004 so the torsion loading on tfwjs is considered to cause only mode iii stress in this study 2 3 an improved approach singularity length method lazzarin and tovo 1998 researched the scale effect of nsif values found out that nifs can be expressed in terms of non dimensional quantities as follows 10 k i k i ref d 1 λ i ref d 1 λ i where k i ref i 1 2 3 are the nifs determined for a reference geometry with a reference geometrical dimension equalling to d ref for instance d ref could be the thickness of the principal plate in tfwjs where λ i i 1 2 3 are the eigenvalues depending on the notch angle 2 α the k i ref d 1 λ i ref in eq 10 is dimensionally a stress it can be expressed as a reference stress σ 0 so that when the considered welded attachment is subjected to uniaxial loading eq 10 can be rewritten as eq 11 11 k 3 k 3 τ 0 t 1 λ 3 where τ 0 is the remotely applied nominal torsion stress referring to the maximum shear stress at the outer surface of the tube for tfwjs it is defined as eq 15 t is the thickness of the main plate of welded joints for instance the tube thickness of tfwjs k 3 are non dimensional parameters which depend on overall welded detail geometry and loading types when it comes to a typical tfwj under torsion loading k 3 is a function of three principal geometric parameters namely h the weld size t thickness of the tube and l thickness of the flange geometric parameters are shown in fig 2 b note that g r 1 means the flange is solid therefore according to above equations the shear stress distribution of mode iii around the weld toe v notch can be described as 12 τ z θ τ 0 2 π 1 x 1 λ 3 f h t l f h t l 1 1 λ 3 θ θ 1 1 λ 3 t 1 λ 3 where x is the distance to the notch corner see fig 2 f 1 h t l is a function of h t l λ 3 can be computed by eq 7 for a given v notch angle 2 α at a given direction θ parameter λ 3 and cos λ 3 θ can be seen as constants and π is a fixed value taking all the constants into f 1 h t l a new function can be defined as 13 h t l f 1 h t l h t l 1 1 λ 3 cos λ 3 θ θ 1 1 λ 3 t π 1 2 1 λ 3 to simplify the calculation a new equivalent parameter as a s f 2 h t l is employed then eq 12 can be simplified as follows 14 τ z θ τ 0 2 a s x 1 λ 3 obviously the equivalent parameter as directly affects the singularity degree of the shear stress distribution meanwhile as has a unit of length its unit should be the same with the distance x so as can be regarded as a characteristic length of the singularity and is named singularity length in next section an approximate formula of as for tfwjs under torsion loading is carried out the shear stress distribution can be conveniently estimated by eq 14 when the geometric parameters are known to determine as value similarly this simple stress estimation method is named as singularity length method slm 3 numerical analysis 3 1 fe modeling linear elastic fe analysis is performed by the finite element software ansys among the ansys element library a special four node two dimensional and harmonic axisymmetric element plane 25 is adopted this employed element type is capable of simulating axisymmetric structures with external loads not necessarily axisymmetric which must be defined as a series of harmonic functions fourier series therefore plane 25 is chosen for modeling three dimensional axisymmetric components subjected to torsion loading keeping the advantage of building two dimensional fe models fig 3 shows an example of 2d fe model in terms of a tfwj the model is axisymmetric around the y axis as the flange is usually bolted in fatigue test and engineering use fixed constraints are assumed at the back face of the flange for fea see left end of the flange in fig 3 for steel the poisson s ratio v is 0 3 and the young modulus e is 206 gpa the nominal torsion stress applied at the right end of tube is set as 1 mpa and the nominal torsion stress of tube is defined by the following classical expression 15 τ 0 m t w t m t π 16 2 r 2 t 4 2 r i 2 r 2 t 4 where r is the inner radius and t is the tube thickness see fig 2b since stress concentration at the v notch corner is very serious so that an extremely fine mesh is required nearby the weld toe while coarser mesh is chosen at the other parts the mesh convergence study is conducted to ensure the accuracy of the fe results the degree of refinement close to the corner is determined by the spacing ratio set in the ansys software the spacing ratio is the ratio of the maximum mesh size to the minimum one on a path or line where the mesh sizes are changed in gradient the stress distributions along the x line see fig 2b adopting different mesh sizes are presented in fig 4 it can be seen that the shear stress distributions are essentially unchanged when the minimum mesh size is 5 10 3 mm or smaller considering the balance of simulation accuracy and acceptable computational cost the minimum mesh size at the notch corner is set to 10 4 mm in the following fe analysis see enlarged scale in fig 3 3 2 parametric study the geometrical parameters of a typical tfwj are defined in fig 2b a series of finite element analysis are employed by using ansys parametric design language apdl aiming to determine the contribution of each parameter to the shear stress distribution in the vertical direction of the tube see x line in fig 2b the ranges of geometrical parameters values correspond to the actual structure sizes the length of the tube l is set as a relatively large value to ensure providing uniform stress field near the notch corner from engineering view the flange thickness l the weld size h and the tube thickness t would affect the stress concentration at the weld toe while other parameters the outer flange length h and the tube inner radius r have little influence on the stress distribution therefore the influences of parameters l thickness of the flange h the weld size and t thickness of the tube on shear stress distribution are discussed by keeping other parameters as constant see fig 5 in view of the engineering range 0 l t 3 0 and 0 h t 4 the value of l is changed from 0 5 cm to 3 cm the value of h is changed from 0 5 cm to 4 cm and the value of t is changed from 1 cm to 4 cm the following conclusions can be revealed 1 the tube thickness t plays a dominant role on the notch shear stress with the increase of t the stress distribution is obviously enhanced 2 the influence of h depends on the value of l and t the stress distribution has almost no change as h increases when t is small while the increase of h enlarges the stress distribution in condition of large t comparing fig 5a l 0 5 cm fig 5b l 2 cm and fig 5c l 3 cm it can be concluded that smaller l makes the effect of h more remarkable on the shear stress distribution 3 3 approximate formulas of as according to the analysis in section 3 2 three main parameters t h and l are considered as the major controllable variables to determine the equivalent parameter as varying t h and l among the engineering parameters ranges 168 fe models are conducted to obtain corresponding shear stress distribution in the direction of tube thickness see x line in fig 2b partial results have been presented in fig 5 the detailed dimensions of these fe models are summarized in table 1 fe results provide discrete data of the stress value τ z θ and the distance from the corner x the eigenvalue λ 3 is 0 8 for 135 weld toe notch therefore the parameter as can be well determined by processing such data in matlab software with eq 14 using nonlinear least squares fitting method the fitting results t 2 m are shown in table 2 it can be seen there is a function relation between l h and t and the corresponding fitting value of as as demonstrated in fig 6 two cases of g r 0 hollow flange and g r 1 solid flange are respectively considered when fitting as formula with parameter l h and t when the value of h l is small the influence of h is invisible and can be neglected the as formula can be obtained according to the other two parameters l and t however with a large value of h l a big size of the weld size h enhances the local stress concentration at the corner the formula needs to contain the obvious effect of h the analysis of fig 6 reveals that as is determined by two approximate formulas the smaller of calculated values of these two formulas is closer to the fitting as from fea therefore estimation formulas of as for tfwjs under torsion loading can be deduced as following simple form 16a a s g r 0 min 0 09 l 0 9 t 0 2 l h 0 1 t t h 0 9 16b a s g r 1 min 0 9 0 09 l 0 9 t 0 9 0 2 l h 0 1 t t h 0 9 for convenience and sufficinet accuracy the approximate formula of g r 0 is set to 0 9 times the formula of g r 1 fig 7 presents the errors of as values between the estimation formulas and fitting results of fea most errors are less than 10 and only case holds the largest error of 21 it can be concluded that the approximate formulas eq 16 can estimate as values with satisfactory accuracy for practical aspects in engineering it is useful to note that the similarity of stresses is contained in as formulas if two similar geometries are scaled by factor d i e the absolute dimension of case b is d times as large as that of case a the parameter as can be seen as a function linearly related to the whole geometry size when the boundary conditions on external forces and displacements are the same the following relations can be derived from eq 14 17 τ z θ b x τ 0 2 a s b x 1 λ 3 τ 0 2 d a s a x 1 λ 3 τ 0 2 a s a x d 1 λ 3 τ z θ a x d τ z θ a x τ z θ b d x 4 verification of singularity length method when the geometric dimensions of a tfwj are known the as value can be rapidly computed by eq 16 then substituting as into eq 14 the shear stresses along the x line see fig 2b can be obtained this is the process how singularity length method slm determines the shear stress distribution to verify the capability of the method shear stress distributions near the toe corner 0 100 mm derived from the slm and the fe results are compared via four examples as shown in fig 8 g r 0 and fig 9 g r 1 the following can be concluded 1 figs 8a and 9a show the cases with the largest as error between the formula eq 16 and the fitting value while even in these two worst cases the shear stresses errors between slm and fea results are less than 6 moreover the stress errors are within 5 or smaller in other cases it can be drawn that the slm has good performance on shear stress estimation near the weld toe corner 2 the shear stress decreases rapidly away from the corner specially when the distance from the corner equals to as 200 the shear stress reduces to about twice the nominal shear stress 2 τ n o m this phenomenon can be explained by substituting x as 200 into eq 14 the shear stress is 18 τ z θ τ 0 2 a s x 1 λ 3 τ 0 2 200 0 2 2 04 τ 0 2 τ 0 similarly it can be inferred that when the distance x as 5 5 the shear stress τ z θ is about equal to the nominal shear stress τ n o m 5 rapid nsif calculation it is widely recognized that nsifs can be employed as fatigue parameter for life prediction of cyclically loaded welded joints with v notch corners lazzarin and tovo 1998 fischer et al 2016 however the computation of exact nsif requires extremely refined finite element mesh where a row of finite element nodes must be along the notch bisector line and the mesh size around the notch tip need to be adjusted around 10 4 mm meneghetti 2013 as the concise formulas of as for thwjs has been established it is feasible to rapidly calculate the mode iii nsif k 3 without any fe process by transforming the formulas in the slm based on eq 9 and eq 14 the mode iii nsif can be expressed as 19 k 3 2 π τ θ z r λ 3 1 cos λ 3 θ π τ 0 a s 1 λ 3 cos λ 3 θ for a tfwj with a 135 notch opening angle λ 3 0 8 θ 22 5 0 the nsif k 3 becomes 20 k 3 π cos 0 1 π a s 0 2 τ 0 1 864 a s 0 2 τ 0 where as can be directly determined by eq 16 lazzarin and tovo 1998 employed fine meshed fe models to directly evaluate the mode i and ii components of nsif according to their method the nsif k 3 can be obtained in the same way fig 10 shows a typical fe model of a tfwj l 1 cm h 0 5 cm t 1 cm g r 1 to compute nsif k 3 and the mesh detail of the notch tip order of magnitude of the smallest mesh size equals to 10 4 mm two dimensional element plane 25 is employed to simplify the modeling process according to the nsif k 3 definition eq 8 any shear stress value along the bisector but adequately close to the weld toe corner can be used to determine the nsif the shear stresses and the corresponding distance r j of the nodes along the bisector line are taken into account at each node j the mode iii nsif can be computed as follows 21 k 3 j 2 π τ z θ j r j 1 λ 3 all these nodes provide the nsif values by means of eq 21 as shown by the red line in fig 10 the shear stress distribution of the nodes near the corner is nearly linear in a log log plot there is a large stability zone ranging from about 10 4 r t to 10 1 r t where the analysis gives a constant and well defined value for nsif k 3 however it is very complicated to conduct the process of fine meshed fe method when applying the eq 20 it becomes much easier to gain the value of nsif k 3 based on the closed form expressions correlating nsifs and local strain energy density sed of sharp notches the nsifs can be rapidly calculated from the sed on a control volume around the weld toe since coarse meshes can provide sufficiently accurate sed lazzarin et al 2010 under pure mode iii loading the link between local sed and k 3 can be expressed as follow lazzarin et al 2008a b 22 w e 3 e k 3 r c 1 λ 3 2 it gives 23 k 3 r c 1 λ 3 e w e 3 691 91 w where e is the young s modulus parameter e 3 depends on the notch angle 2 α and the poisson s ratio v for 2 α 135 o and v 0 3 e 3 is found to be 0 2586 lazzarin et al 2008a b rc is the radius of the control volume it turns out to be 0 28 mm for welded joints in mild steels livieri and lazzarin 2005 the coarse meshes used to obtain the local sed of tfwjs are referring to the literature lazzarin et al 2010 fig 11 shows overall meshes of an fe example at the weld toe the control volume is a circle of radius 0 28 mm embedded in a square with 4 mm sides to compare aforementioned three nsif calculation methods fine meshed fe coarse meshed fe for sed and eq 20 six typical tfwj geometry sizes are investigated here the external load is assumed as torsion loading with nominal torsion stress 1 mpa for convenience the comparison results are summarized in table 3 the fine meshed fe results are taken as the reference the errors varies from 4 21 to 5 16 for coarse meshed fe and are within 2 for eq 20 both the coarse meshed fe method and the proposed analytical solution eq 20 have good performance on rapid nsif calculation it demonstrates that the nsif k 3 of tfwjs can be rapidly calculated though the proposed analytical solution having an advantage of very simple expressions eq 20 and eq 16 without any fe processing 6 fatigue strength assessment the most common way to assess and to design the fatigue strength of welded joints is using the reference s n curves based on the nominal stress range which are divided into different fatigue classes fat express in mpa of the fatigue strength at 2 million cycles curves for various structural details hobbacher 2016 these fatigue strength curves are linear in the double logarithm coordinate which can be defined as following expressions 24 log n log c d σ k log s where n is the predicted fatigue life cycles under the stress range s c is a constant whose value is specific to each structural detail σ is the standard deviation of log n d is the number of the standard deviation and d equals to 2 below the mean curve for safe fatigue design with 97 7 survival probability k is the inverse slope of s n curve the iiw international institute of welding and ec3 eurocode 3 2005 standards provide several fat s n curves for various welded structural details under direct or normal stress ranges difference between maximum and minimum value however for shear stress ranges the fatigue phenomena are less concerned and there is no well defined constant amplitude fatigue limit the standards just provide a unique s n curve fat 100 k 5 for toe fatigue failure of steel welded joints on the basis of the shear stress range the approach based on notch stress intensity factor nsif naturally takes the influence of weld toe detail and the scale effect into account and has been considered to be more accurate than the nominal stress approach fischer et al 2016 livieri and lazzarin 2005 systematically analyzed large amount of fatigue tests data under tension or bending loading using the nsif approach proposed a design mean curve and corresponding scatter bound of mode i nsif for welded joints however fatigue strength assessment under shear stress ranges which is related to the mode iii nsif is also ambiguous in order to assess the fatigue strength of welded joints in alternating shear stress state and to validate the application of rapid nsif calculation for fatigue strength assessment at the same time six series of fatigue test data concerning tfwj specimens subjected to pure torsion have been summarized from the literature all specimens are made of structural steels table 4 and fig 12 report the main geometry sizes and fatigue loading conditions of the specimens note that the round or square flange would make no difference according to the parametric study in section 3 2 for all specimens a weld toe angle equalling to 135 is assumed the same as that in the theory and numerical analysis in the previous sections moreover considering the worst case of un dressed welding in all fatigue specimens the weld toe cross section is a pointed v notch with zero radius all selected specimens are under pure torsion loading mode iii loading and their failure location are at the weld toe fig 13 shows all summarized fatigue tests results expressed in nominal shear stress range according to the iiw and ec3 standards fat 100 curve is recommended for these data it is obvious that the design curve of standards is very safe but too conservative especially in high cycle region to be more accurate statistical analysis has been conducted with the same tests data s n curves with ps survival probability 2 3 and 97 7 i e mean curve two standard deviations are demonstrated in fig 13 at the reference 2 million cycles n a 2 10 6 cycles the fatigue strength δ τ with survival probability of 97 7 is 138 mpa which is much higher than the recommended value 100 mpa fat 100 the inverse slope of the fatigues curves is 6 6 and the scatter index defined by eq 25 is 1 84 25 t σ δ τ n a p s 2 3 δ τ n a p s 97 7 a rapid calculation method for nsif k 3 has been established in the section 5 fig 14 shows the fatigue data expressed in rapidly calculated nsif k 3 range statistical analysis of these nsif values has been carried out with k n curves k n curve can be defined as eq 26 referring to the basic s n curve expression the mean value of δ k 3 at n a 2 10 6 cycles is 136 mpa m0 2 the scatter index t k is 1 83 and the inverse slope of k n curves is 6 7 both values are close to the analysis results of the nominal shear stress range one possible reason may explain the phenomenon the available experiment data provides a small change of tube thicknesses 7 mm 10mm and weld sizes 6 3 mm 10mm which means each test specimen have similar size effect it shows that mode iii nsif can be applied for fatigue strength assessment of tfwjs under torsion loading 26 log n log c k d σ k log k furthermore modified k n curves with a uniform scatter index and curve slope would be more practical in fatigue design fig 15 shows the proposed design k n curves the proposed inverse slope k is 5 00 according to the inverse slope of s n curve for shear stress ranges in standards the proposed scatter index with survival probabilities 2 3 97 7 is 1 90 which is consistent with the scatter index t 1 50 with survival probabilities of 10 90 determined by haibach 1989 the mean fatigue strength at na is 120 mpa m0 2 it can be seen that the proposed design k n curves are quite suitable for the tests data with satisfactory accuracy the k n curve with survival probability of 97 7 can be employed for safe fatigue design of steel tfwjs by the fatigue parameter δ k 3 based on eq 26 this curve can be expressed as following simple form 27 log n 5 log k 3 16 7 conclusions a brief method named singularity length method slm is introduced to determine the shear stress distribution at the v notch corner subject to mode iii loading the key of slm is the equivalent parameter as named singularity length which directly relates to the stress singularity and physically has a unit of length for tube flange welded joints tfwjs under torsion loading as is expressed as formulas of three main geometric parameters though a series of finite element analysis thus the shear stress distribution near the weld toe corner can be easily estimated by eq 14 for known dimensions of a tfwj following this the rapidly calculated formula eq 20 of the mode iii nsif is derived based on the slm six series of fatigue tests data of tfwjs under pure torsion are employed for fatigue strength assessments based on the nominal shear stress range and the rapidly calculated mode iii nsif range the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the shear stress distribution around weld toe corner predicted by the slm is in good agreement with the fe results for tfwjs under torsion loading among all the geometric parameters of tfwjs thickness of the flange l the weld size h and thickness of the tube t play the dominant role on the shear stress distribution 2 comparison of nsif k 3 calculations shows excellent agreement between the fine meshed fe the coarse meshed fe for sed and proposed analytical solution eq 20 3 fatigue assessment of the employed test data indicates that the design s n curve in the standards is too conservative and the mode iii nsif is well applied for fatigue

22687,the pore pressure of coastal marine soft clay will accumulate under cyclic loading resulting in the reduction of the effective stress and hence the post cyclic strength degrades such characteristic of clay would affect the stability of the structures on the clay ground most of the previous post cyclic strength degradation models are semi empirical ones a few researchers developed elastic plastic models by introducing the parameter of accumulated deviatoric plastic strain into the hardening rule these models considered the complete strength loss of clay in the state of cyclic failure but cannot take into account strength degradation in the state of cyclic stability therefore a cyclic memory parameter was introduced to develop a post cyclic strength degradation bounding surface model this model was proposed based on the classical bounding surface model with a vanishing elastic region the post cyclic strength degradation was achieved by the shrinkage of the bounding surface during cyclic loading and the degradation is not unlimited under the control of the cyclic memory parameter the accuracy and validity of the proposed model were verified by comparing the predicted and the triaxial experimental results moreover the effectiveness of the model for predicting the cyclic and post cyclic shear characteristics of clay under various loading conditions was further demonstrated keywords soft clay cyclic loading post cyclic strength degradation bounding surface model numerical simulation 1 introduction there are many nearshore and offshore structures built on the saturated soft clay ground the stability of these structures which are subjected to kinds of cyclic loads such as waves storm surges and earthquakes during their service time rely on the stability of the soft clay foundation under cyclic loading previous researches showed that the excess pore pressure of the marine soft clay will accumulate under cyclic loading and the effective stress decreases and hence the phenomenon of the post cyclic strength degradation occurs andersen et al 1980 matsui et al 1992 yasuhara et al 1992 2004 yasuhara 1994 erken and ülker 2007 kaya and erken 2015 this characteristic of the marine soft clay affect the work performance and bearing capacity of the structures on the clay ground therefore it is of high significance to develop a proper constitutive model to precisely evaluate the strength degradation of the soft clay due to cyclic loading in the previous researches the constitutive models which can consider the strength degradation for clay under cyclic loading were mainly can divided into three categories the first type includes the models based on the iwan series model which considers the effect of the mean principle effective stress on model parameters puzrin et al 1995 or the models depend on the softening parameters proposed by idriss et al 1978 which describes the cyclic softening stress strain characteristics with masing rule rao and panda 1998 the second type was proposed based on the theory of equivalent overconsolidation for clay yasuhara et al 2003 soroush and soltani jigheh 2009 wang et al 2017 this type of model considered that the clay after cyclic loading behaves similar to the overconsolidated clay produced by real unloading these two models were developed specifically to simulate the strain softening behavior or strength degradation characteristic due to cyclic loading but some important dynamic characteristics such as dynamic deformation and cyclic pore pressure of the clay were ignored besides it is impossible for these models to consider the influence of the loading effective stress paths on the calculation results the third type of model is elastic plastic model mroz et al 1978 proposed a modified two surface model based on the isotropic and kinematic hardening criteria this model inserts a middle plane between the elastic kernel and the bounding surface and an accumulated deviatoric plastic strain was introduced in the hardening equation to achieve the shrinkage of the middle plane thereby achieving the prediction of the shear strength decreasing due to cyclic loading based on a generalized isotropic hardening criterion hu et al 2012 and hu and liu 2014 2015 established a damage single surface model to consider the cyclic softening of saturated clay this model introduced a damage variable in the hardening equation to characterize the degree of soil fabric damage and remodeling due to cyclic loading the models proposed by mroz and hu both use the parameter of plastic deviatoric strain to consider the effect of the cyclic loading on the shrinkage of yield surface or bounding surface when a clay specimen is sheared to failure whether in a monotonic shear test or a cyclic shear test the mapping point locates on the bounding surface where the deviatoric plastic strain increment is far larger than the volume strain increment leading to a large negative increment of hardening parameter in such condition the yield surface or bounding surface will shrink infinitely these models can consider the simulation of the complete strength loss of clay in the state of cyclic failure but it is impossible to take into account the strength degradation for clay in the state of cyclic stability liang and ma 1992 proposed a rotational hardening bounding surface model and introduced the plastic deviatoric strain in the plastic modulus formula to take into account the soil fabric remodeling effect on stiffness degradation wang and yao 1996 took the parameters of the bounding surface radius or the maximum elastic modulus at initial loading to describe the isotropic degradation of the soil although both models introduced the plastic deviatoric strain into the plastic modulus function avoiding the defects of the mroz and hu models they cannot predict the characteristics of post cyclic strength degradation simultaneously with the simulation of the stiffness degradation in addition the critical state model modified by carter et al 1982 on the basis of the cambridge model to introduce an additional function to explain the degradation of soil strength caused by cyclic loading this model has been further modified by indraratna et al 2015 and ni et al 2015 for better prediction of the cyclic behavior of soft clay these two models are based on the cambridge model and make some modifications which can characterize the cyclic behavior of clay to a certain extent however the prediction of the cyclic stress strain relationship by these two models is still not as accurate as that with the bounding surface model moreover shi et al 2018 proposed an hybrid plastic flow rule within the bounding surface framework which could consider the strength deterioration during earthquakes but a total of 8 additional parameters were introduced nie et al 2016 applied a constitutive model which has 12 parameters based on the bouc wen model and endochronic theory to investigate the stiffness and strength changes resulting from cyclic loading of granular soil the excessive parameters making these models difficult to be applied in practical application there are also other kinds of models like the discrete element method ravishankar et al 2009 to consider the post liquefaction undrained monotonic behavior of sands which has not been proved to be suitable for clay the degradation expression proposed by zhou and randolph 2015 was used to investigate the interpretation of cyclic t bar and ball penetrometer tests in soft clay the damage law estimated by pineda et al 2014 was used to represent the progressive degradation of the shear strength parameters as a function of the accumulated strain however these two models were mainly developed based on the experimental results and lack of theoretical basis the present work introduced a cyclic memory parameter considering the mechanism of strength degradation after cyclic loading to develop a modified bounding surface model based on the classical one with a vanishing elastic region this model can reasonably simulate the cyclic and monotonic shear properties of soft clay and consider the strength degradation of clay due to cyclic loading comparing to the traditional bounding surface model an additional parameter was introduced in the modified model avoiding excessive parameters and complicated hardening criteria it makes the model easily applied in the numerical application the accuracy and validity of the developed model were verified by comparing with the triaxial experimental data moreover the effectiveness of the proposed model was further demonstrated by predicting the cyclic and post cyclic shear characteristics of clay under various loading conditions 2 bounding surface model considering the post cyclic strength degradation the classical bounding surface model with a vanishing elastic region proposed by dafalias and popov 1975 can describe the dynamic characteristics of clay which was adopted in this paper as the framework of the proposed model for the purpose of clarify some concepts of the critical state model need to be briefly demonstrated the model can be applied to three dimensional numerical calculation and thus the tensor quantities are used to express the formulation of the model the detail of critical state concept and the derivation of the basic formula e g equations 1 10 can be found in the literature schofield 1968 wood 1990 manzari and dafalias 1997 the following eq 1 is the calculation formula for the first effective stress invariant p and the eq 2 is the calculation formula for the volume strain ε v the repeated indices imply the summation convention 1 p σ 11 σ 22 σ 33 3 1 3 σ i i 2 ε v ε 11 ε 22 ε 33 ε i i the definition of deviator parts of stress and strain tensors are shown as the following equations 3 s i j σ i j p δ i j 4 e i j ε i j 1 3 ε v δ i j where δ ij denotes the kronecker delta which is the rank 2 identity tensor the definitions of stress and strain invariants used in this paper are as follows 5 q 3 2 s i j s i j 6 ε q 2 3 e i j e i j in triaxial tests since the σ 2 σ 3 the deviatoric axial stress q σ 1 σ 3 and the mean effective principal stress p σ 1 2σ 3 3 2 1 elastic strain the strain tensor increments can be decomposed into an elastic strain increment part and a plastic strain increment part as shown in eq 7 7 d ε i j d ε i j e d ε i j p where dε ij dε ij e and dε ij p are the total strain tensor increment the elastic strain tensor increment and the plastic strain tensor increment respectively according to generalized hooke s law the stress strain relationship of the soil should satisfy the eq 8 and eq 9 8 d p k ε v e k d ε v d ε v p 9 d s i j 2 g d e i j e 2 g d e i j d e i j p where k is the bulk modulus and g is the shear modulus according to the critical state theory the values of k and g depend on the current stress state and the current void ratio the calculation formulas of k and g are shown in eq 10 and eq 11 10 k 1 e κ p 11 g 3 k 2 1 2 μ 1 μ where κ is the slope of swelling line in the e lnp plane μ is the poisson s ratio and e is the void ratio 2 2 bounding surface and loading surface equations the bounding surface equation is in the form of an ellipse which is consistent with the modified cambridge model as shown in eq 12 12 f σ i j p 0 s i j s i j 2 3 m 2 p p 0 p 0 where s i j and p are the image deviatoric stress tensor and mean effective pressure tensor on the bounding surface mapped by the current stress point the p 0 is the hardening parameter of the bounding surface indicating the size of the bounding surface the m is the slope of the critical state line which indicates the stress ratio q p at failure and can be obtained by triaxial compression tests the loading surface equation form is the same as that of the bounding surface as shown in eq 13 13 f σ i j p 1 s i j s i j 2 3 m 2 p p 1 p 0 where s i j is the deviatoric stress tensor at the current stress point p 1 is the parameter of loading surface indicating the size of the loading surface 2 3 mapping rule and flow rule the mapping rule should be defined for bounding surface model to determine the location of the image stress point in the bounding surface in the current model the radial mapping rule proposed by dafalias 1986 and applied by most of the bounding surface models is used the projection center is assumed as the origin of the stress space therefore the plastic modulus in the current stress point can be calculated and the plastic flow direction of the current stress point is consistent with the normal direction of the image stress point in the bounding surface model the position of the current stress point a and the image stress point a in the p q stress space can be shown in fig 1 and the mapping rule is defined by the following relation 14 σ i j β σ i j where β is a parameter defining the distance between the loading surface and bounding surface the formula for calculating the plastic strain increment is as follows 15 d ε i j p d λ r i j where dλ is the plastic multiplier the r ij is the second order tensor representing the direction of plastic strain increment in stress space the denotes the macauley bracket making d λ non negative when d λ 0 d λ d λ when d λ 0 d λ 0 the dλ can be calculated by the following formula 16 d λ 1 k p l i j d σ i j 1 k p l i j d σ i j where l ij is the loading direction at the current stress point k p is the plastic modulus at the current stress point k p is the plastic modulus at the image stress point if the associated flow rule is applied r ij can be calculated by the eq 17 17 r i j l i j f σ i j the eq 18 can be obtained by substituting eq 14 and eq 17 into eq 15 and then the value and direction of the plastic strain increment of the model can be obtained 18 d ε v p 1 k p f σ i j d σ i j f p d e i j p 1 k p f σ i j d σ i j f s i j 2 4 modified hardening rule the hardening law was modified to consider the shrinkage of bounding surface during cyclic loading based on the relationship between the strength degradation and the effective stress reduction during cycling so that the bounding surface model can reasonably describe the cyclic and post cyclic characteristics of clay carter et al 1982 used a simple method to modify the cambridge model to consider the plastic deformation within the yield surface it assumed that the increase in accumulative plastic strain and cyclic effect are caused by the change in the yield surface size during the elastic unloading in the current model the method of carter was employed and modified as shown in fig 1 point a is the current stress point and it is on the loading surface when it continues to load at the point a the isotropic expansion of the loading surface along the direction of i occurs at this point an isotopic hardening law of eq 19 is used and the plastic strain at point a increases 19 d p 0 p 0 ν λ κ d ε v p where v is current specific volume λ is the slope of the normal consolidation line in the e lnp plane when it is unloaded at the stress point of a the loading surface will shrink along the direction ii the hardening parameter p 1 of the loading surface will decrease at this point the parameter p 0 of the bounding surface decreases due to the shrinkage of the loading surface the relationship between the change rate of p 0 and p 1 satisfies the eq 20 20 d p 0 p 0 θ n d p 1 p 1 if θ is set to a constant like the cambridge model of carter et al 1982 the change rate of the parameter p 1 that controls the size of yield surface will gradually increase with the number of cycles increasing it is not applicable for the clay subjected to a small cyclic stress which can reach a state of cyclic stability the mean effective stress and the pore pressure of such clay will reach a stable value as well as the post cyclic strength degradation rate wang et al 2018 therefore the variation of θ needs to satisfy the following two conditions 1 the degradation rate of the bounding surface size p 0 should be positively related to the degradation rate of the effective mean pressure during cycling 2 after a sufficient number of cycles θ should tend to be zero so that the contraction rate of the bounding surface size p 0 tends to zero considering the above two conditions the eq 21 was introduced to control the change of θ so that the model can consider the strength degradation of the clay during the cyclic loading 21 θ n ω p i n 1 p p 0 where ω is a model degradation constant ω 0 which controls the degradation rate of the bounding surface size during cyclic loading p is the current mean effective pressure p i n 1 is the cyclic memory parameter representing the mean effective stress at the end of the n 1 th unloading process the physical meaning of the cyclic memory parameter can be explained with the triaxial tests as shown in fig 2 p i 0 is the maximum effective mean pressure during initial loading for clay specimen with the number of cycles increase the superscript value of p i n 1 increases and the value of p i n 1 decreases in a loading process of a cycle the p i n 1 keeps constant when the process of the nth unloading is finished and the loading reverses for next cyclic load the p i n 1 is updated to p i n according to previous researches the post cyclic strength of clay degrades with the decrease in the effective stress the formula of p i n 1 p p 0 characterize the effective stress reduction during process of loading and unloading because the strength degradation rate of different clays varies with the reduction rate in effective stress a parameter is needed to characterize the degradation rate of the clay which is the physical meaning of model degradation constant ω according to the analysis of eq 21 the parameter θ is positively correlated to the mean effective principle stress p of the two adjacent unloading process when the cyclic steady state is reached dθ n tends to be zero and the size of bounding surface keeps constant the above two conditions for θ is satisfied and the strength degradation under cyclic loading for clay is achieved in the current model 2 5 plastic modulus according to the traditional bounding surface theory dafalias and popov 1975 dafalias 1986 the plastic modulus of the current stress point can be determined by the distance between the current stress point and the image stress point in the current model the plastic modulus is in the following form proposed by dafalias 1986 for uniaxial loading 22 k p k p h p β 1 β where k p is the plastic modulus for the current stress point k p is the plastic modulus of the image stress point h is a scalar function and β is the ratio between the distance from image stress point to projection center and distance from current stress point of stress point to projection center the following relation can be obtained by applying the continuity equation to the bounding surface equation 23 f s i j d s i j f p d p f ε v p d ε v p 0 substituting eq 12 and eq 19 into the above equation the plastic modulus formula at the image stress point can be obtained 24 k p 8 9 m 4 ν λ κ p p 0 p 1 2 p 0 applying the formula suggested by manzari and nour 1997 for calculating the scalar function h the following equation can be obtained 25 h h 0 16 9 m 4 ν λ κ p 3 where h 0 is a model constant 3 validation studies 3 1 comparison between the prediction results and experimental data 3 1 1 ma 13 clay subjected to strain controlled cyclic loading in order to further verify the accuracy and validity of the developed model the post cyclic triaxial tests conducted by matsui et al 1992 were adopted in this section the tested clay specimens were undisturbed normal consolidated ma 13 clay the properties of the tested ma 13 clay are as follows specific gravity 2 67 initial water content 63 initial dry density 1 1 g cm3 liquid limit 72 5 plastic limit 27 9 and plasticity index 44 6 the confining pressure was 196 kpa and the total number of cycles was 100 the cyclic loading was strain controlled different cyclic axial strain amplitudes including 0 i e no cyclic history 0 486 0 991 and 1 922 were applied the required parameters for the model are shown in table 1 the comparisons between the predicted results and experimental data are shown in fig 3 fig 3 a illustrates the post cyclic undrained monotonic shear stress strain relation with different cyclic axial strain amplitudes although the results predicted by the model slightly deviate from the experimental results in the initial shear stage the prediction lines basically coincide with the experimental data with the progress of the shearing the characteristic that the post cyclic shear stiffness and strength decreases with the increase in the cyclic axial strain amplitudes can be accurately reflected the comparison of the measured and predicted post cyclic effective shear paths for the specimens under different cyclic axial strain amplitudes are demonstrated in fig 3 b c and d it shows that for the strain control cyclic triaxial tests the reduction in the deviator stress in each circle with the progressive cyclic loading can be observed which is resulted by the decreasing stiffness of clay after 100 times of cyclic loading the mean effective principle pressure reach a relative stability and the accumulated pore pressure also stabilizes the effective shear paths for specimens of ε d 0 486 and ε d 0 basically coincide with the test results but the shear paths of ε d 0 991 and ε d 1 922 not match well with the experimental results the phenomenon of the prediction results not matching well with the experimental data are mainly caused by the following two reason first the model is a theoretical model and is founded on the critical state theory resulting in that the model is not suitable to precisely simulate all properties of clay besides the existence of inconsistency in soil samples and test errors will lead fluctuation in the experimental results fig 4 a and b respectively show the experimental and predicted post cyclic shear induced pore pressure of normally consolidated ma 13 clay for the specimens with higher cyclic axial strain amplitudes the corresponding ultimate shear induced pore pressure is larger meanwhile the post cyclic shear pore pressure curves of ε d 0 991 and ε d 1 922 which rise at first and then decrease to a relatively stable value have the different forms with that of ε d 0 486 and ε d 0 which continue growing until a stable value reached above all the proposed model can reasonably predict the post cyclic shear characteristics especially the feature of strength and stiffness degradation due to cyclic loading for soft clay 3 1 2 lean clay with a low plasticity subjected to stress controlled cyclic loading the experiments conducted by yasuhara et al 2003 are used to further verify the correction of the modified bounding surface model the properties of the tested soil are as follows specific gravity of solids g s 2 787 liquid limit w l 38 6 and plasticity index i p 19 7 the soil which was called as low plasticity silt in the original paper can also be defined as a lean clay with low plasticity according to the united soil classification system the specimens with different normalized cyclic pore pressure δu p c 0 241 0 578 0 801 and specimen with no previous cyclic loading are used to validate the model these specimens are normally consolidated under the confining pressure p c 392 kpa after the isotropic normal consolidation and the stress controlled cyclic loading a monotonic undrained shearing process is applied to the soil to investigate the effect of cyclic loading history on the clay the required parameters for the model are shown in table 2 the comparisons between the predicted results and experimental data are shown in fig 5 fig 5 a illustrates the post cyclic undrained shear effective stress paths of experimental and predicted results fig 5 b shows the experimental and predicted stress strain curves under different normalized cyclic pore pressure the prediction results of the proposed model are slightly deviation from the experimental results but they all basically reflect the development of effective stress paths and stress strain relationship and effectively reflect the characteristics post cyclic undrained shear strength degradation of the soil which demonstrates the accuracy and validity of model the traditional method to estimate the post cyclic shear strength of clay is to use the semi empirical model proposed by yasuhara et al 2003 based on the equivalent overconsolidation concept the comparison between the experimental results and the results respectively predicted by the proposed model and yasuhara model are shown in fig 6 the test data of the post cyclic undrained strength ratio versus normalized excess pore pressure of the soil under the confining pressure of 192 kpa were carried out by yasuhara and toyota 1997 on the same type of soil as can be seen from the fig 6 the proposed model and yasuhara model have the similar predictions for the measured data and can both effectively predict the post cyclic undrained strength degradation of the soil however comparing to the equivalent overconsolidation model proposed by yasuhara the modified bounding surface model can also predict the effective stress path and stress strain relationship of the soil while predicting the strength degradation 3 2 cyclic memory parameter and model degradation constant through the above introduction of the cyclic memory parameter p i n it can be seen that this parameter is an internal variable therefore the parameters required for the developed model are divided into two groups the first group is the modified cambridge model parameters ie λ κ m which can be measured by the triaxial tests the other group consists of the bounding surface shape function constant h 0 and the surface model degradation constant ω introduced in this paper the strength degradation degree calculated by the current model is affected by both cyclic memory parameter and model degradation constant the parameter ω which determine the shrinkage rate of bounding surface size due to cycling characterizes the effect of effective stress reduction of the soil due to the increasing of accumulative pore pressure during cyclic loading on the strength degradation meanwhile the cyclic memory parameter which will reach a relative stable value under cyclic stability so does the size of the bounding surface the model parameters in table 3 are used for predicting the cyclic behavior of the soft clay to illustrate the meaning of the two parameters the loading condition concludes the confining pressure of 300 kpa and the cyclic stress amplitude of 50 kpa the parameter ω 3 2 1 0 is varied to demonstrate its influence on the size of bounding surface which can be represented by the hardening parameter p 0 the calculation results are showed in fig 7 comparing to the case without cyclic degradation ω 0 the ω introduced can effectively decrease the size of bounding surface and then determine the strength degradation rate due to cyclic loading for the soft clay it shows that after a specific number of cyclic loading the value of p 0 for the case with ω 0 is less than that with ω 0 meanwhile after a certain amount number of cycles the p 0 will not continue decreasing but reach a stable value except for the case with ω 3 the cyclic stability for the clay is achieved by the memory parameter p i n for the specimens with larger value of ω the constant value of p 0 cannot be reached and the cyclic failure occurs during cyclic loading therefore the value of ω can be determined according to the strength degradation degree of the clay under cyclic loading generally the value of ω can be calibrated by trial calculation of the post cyclic shear strength 3 3 prediction of post cyclic shear behavior and overconsolidated shear characteristic when the clay is subjected to the undrained cyclic loading the accumulated pore pressure will grow resulting in the decrease in the effective stress of the clay previous researches show that the clay after the cyclic loading may behave similar to the overconsolidated clay which refers to the phenomenon of equivalent overconsolidation andersen et al 1980 hyde and ward 1985 yasuhara et al 1992 1994 2003 therefore in this section the post cyclic shear behavior and the overconsolidated clay shear characteristic are predicted by the proposed model the model parameters in table 3 are used for the calculation the confining pressure for the normally consolidated clay equals to 300 kpa and the pre consolidation pressure of the overconsolidated clay is the same the comparison between the post cyclic shear of normally consolidated clay with different value of ω and the static shear of overconsolidated clay are shown in fig 8 their effective stress paths in p and q plane are illustrated in fig 8 a it can be seen that for the normally consolidated clay after cyclic loading its effective stress paths are similar with that of the overconsolidated clay with ω 0 the post cyclic shear path far exceeds that of the overconsolidated clay and the shear failure point of a post cyclic specimen coincide with that of specimen with no previous cycling however with the increase in the value of ω the post cyclic shear path is gradually approaching the path of an overconsolidated clay fig 8 b shows the prediction of the lnp versus e for post cyclic clay and overconsolidated clay in e lnp plane during undrained cyclic shear a normally consolidated clay specimen at point a approach to point b the specimen during the post cyclic shearing behaves in a similar manner to an overconsolidated clay specimen produced by unloading from point d to point b the shear failure points of post cyclic clay specimen locate on the line of ab and approach to that of an overconsolidated clay specimen with the increase of ω indicating a similar behavior to the overconsolidated clay the above calculation results all demonstrate that the proposed model can reasonably reflect the phenomenon of equivalent overconsolidation of the clay 3 4 prediction of post cyclic strength under different number of cycles in this section the prediction of the model for the post cyclic strength under different number of cycles was verified the model parameters in table 3 are used for the calculation and the value of the model degradation constant ω equals to 2 0 the confining pressure equaling to 300 kpa and the cyclic stress amplitude equaling to 100 kpa were applied the prediction results are shown in fig 9 the post cyclic shear failure criterion is set as 15 of the accumulated axial strain andersen et al 1980 for comparison the results for the case without cyclic loading history curve a also plotted in the fig 9 a and fig 9 b the cyclic and post cyclic effective stress paths under different number of cycles n in the p q plane are showed in fig 9 a it can be seen that with the gradually increasing number of cycles the mean effective principle stress p decreases the more number of cycles the smaller the p value at the initial post cyclic shear is the end points of the post cyclic shear paths located on the critical stress line csl their corresponding deviator stress at failure is less than that of curve a and decreases with the increase in the cyclic numbers the accumulated axial strain increases with the increase in the number of cycles and the post cyclic shear strength decreases with the number of cycles increasing which is consistent with that of wang et al 2018 as shown in fig 9 b moreover with the cyclic numbers increasing the initial post cyclic shearing stiffness decreases due to cyclic loading the relationship between the normalized post cyclic shear strength and the normalized accumulated cyclic pore pressure can be seen in fig 9 c the s u cy is the post cyclic shear strength and s u is the monotonic shear strength without previous cyclic loading the normalized post cyclic shear strength decreases with the increase in the normalized accumulated cyclic pore pressure besides the higher the accumulative pore pressure the larger the normalized strength degradation rate is fig 9 d illustrates the cyclic accumulative pore pressure development of the curve g for the clay specimens with the number of cycles less than 60 their cyclic pore pressure curves coincide with the curve g 3 5 prediction of post cyclic strength under different cyclic stress amplitude the purpose of this section is to evaluate the model for predicting the post cyclic strength under different cyclic stress level of soft clay the soil parameters in table 3 are applied and the value of ω equals 2 0 three different loading conditions are adopted and the confining pressure of 300 kpa is employed the cyclic stress amplitude q cy is applied as 50 kpa 100 kpa and 140 kpa for the first second and third loading condition respectively fig 10 a shows the relationship between the hardening parameter p 0 and the cyclic numbers it shows that under the same consolidation pressure the larger the cyclic stress amplitude the higher shrink rate of the bounding surface is when the cyclic stress level is large enough the cyclic failure can be reached in little cyclic number such as the third loading condition with the decrease in the cyclic stress level the shrinkage rate of the bounding surface decreases the stress strain curves for the first and third loading condition are showed in fig 10 c and fig 10 b respectively for the third loading condition the plastic axial strain in each cycle increases drastically and reach cyclic failure in few cycles however for the first loading condition which has a lower cyclic stress level the axial strain accumulates in a slow rate the 2 5 of axial strain is accumulated after the 1000th cycles and state of cyclic stability is reached fig 10 d illustrates the development of the cyclic pore pressure for different loading conditions it shows that with a higher cyclic stress level the cyclic pore pressure will accumulate in a high rate the larger the cyclic pore pressure the smaller mean effective principle stress is and thus the lower the post cyclic strength is 3 6 prediction of post cyclic strength under different confining pressure the prediction of the model for the post cyclic strength under different confining pressure is validated in this section the soil parameters in table 3 are adopted and the ω 2 is applied four different loading conditions are applied with cyclic stress amplitude q cy 100 kpa the confining pressure for different loading conditions are 300 kpa 350 kpa 400 kpa and 450 kpa for the first second third and fourth loading conditions respectively the clay in different loading conditions are conducted post cyclic shear tests after the 60th loading cycles the post cyclic effective stress paths for the four loading conditions are shown in fig 11 a for comparison the monotonic shear effective paths with corresponding confining pressure are also plotted it demonstrates that under the same cyclic loading cycles and cyclic stress amplitudes the post cyclic strength is lower than the corresponding static monotonic shear strength moreover the degradation rate increases with the increase in the confining pressure fig 11 b illustrates the development of the pore pressure during cycling for the first and the fourth loading condition the accumulated cyclic pore pressure increases gradually with progressive cyclic loading the increasing rate of the pore pressure is lower with a larger confining pressure 3 7 comparison of the results with different models in this section the prediction of the proposed model called mob is compared with that of different models the prediction results using the method considering the cyclic strength degradation by introducing the deviatoric plastic strain into the hardening rule mroz et al 1978 hu et al 2012 called midest is showed for contrast the bounding surface function loading surface function flow rule and mapping rule of midest model are consistent with that of mob model but a degradation parameter h is introduced into the hardening rule function as shown in eq 26 and the variation of h is related to the plastic deviatoric strain δe p as shown in eq 27 the δ is the midest model constant and set as 0 5 26 p 0 n 1 p 0 n exp ν λ κ δ ε p h n 1 h n 27 h n 1 h n exp δ δ 2 3 δ e n 1 p δ e n 1 p the post cyclic shear characteristics prediction results of mob and midest are illustrated in the fig 12 besides the cambridge model cmm and the bounding surface model bounds without modification are also included in fig 12 the post cyclic effective shear paths and the relationship of the deviator stress and axial strain for different types of model are plotted in the fig 12 a and fig 12 b respectively the model of cmm considers no plastic strain occurring within the yield surface therefore with the cyclic loading processing the cyclic effective stress paths coincide with the effective paths in the first unloading and reloading process which is not consistent with the experimental results the models of bounds mob and midest belong to the bounding surface model which can consider the development of plastic strain as the stress point within the bounding surface therefore the post cyclic shear behaviors are simulated when the same effective pressure is reached according to the simulation results the bounds can basically characterize the effect of cyclic loading however as discussed above the model of bounds cannot describe the post cyclic degradation behavior like mob although the model of midest can consider the shrink of bounding surface during cyclic loading the hardening parameter p 0 of the bounding surface will reduce to naught resulting in the unreasonable post cyclic effective shear path and stress strain curve when the clay is sheared to be failure the bounding surface model modified in this paper can reasonably predict the cyclic and post cyclic behavior of soft clay compared to the model which introduced the plastic deviatoric strain in the hardening law 4 conclusion in this paper a cyclic memory parameter was introduced in the hardening rule to develop a post cyclic strength degradation bounding surface model by considering the mechanism of strength degradation after cyclic loading the model has the following characteristics 1 this model is based on the classic bounding surface model with a vanishing elastic region and can correctly simulate the pore pressure behavior and stress strain hysteresis characteristics of the clay during cycling 2 the model introduces one new parameter model degradation constant allowing it to predict the post cyclic strength degradation of clay therefore it takes the advantage of few parameters and simple numerical integration method avoiding too much parameters and being applied complicatedly 3 the accuracy and validity of the proposed model have been verified by comparing the prediction results with the experimental data the estimated model can also reasonably indicate the phenomenon of equivalent overconsolidation of clay in addition the cyclic and post cyclic characteristics predicted by the proposed model under different number of cycles cyclic stress ratio and confining pressure are consistent with the experimental characteristics of clay 4 comparing to the previous models which added the plastic deviatoric strain in the hardening law the model in this paper can describe the post cyclic shear characteristics and strength degradation behavior of soft clay more reasonably it is worth noting that the bounding surface model proposed to describe the post cyclic strength degradation characteristics is suitable to the normally consolidated clays however whether the proposed model is suitable to the over consolidated clay or not needs further verification in addition the cyclic behavior of soft clay is drastically complex and the calculation results of the bounding surface model is only consistent with the actual test results in some degree the further modification of the model including the bounding surface formula plastic modulus interpolation formula and the cyclic degradation function is required to match the test results more accurately acknowledgments this work was supported by the national key research and development program of china grant number 2016yfc0802204 grant

22687,the pore pressure of coastal marine soft clay will accumulate under cyclic loading resulting in the reduction of the effective stress and hence the post cyclic strength degrades such characteristic of clay would affect the stability of the structures on the clay ground most of the previous post cyclic strength degradation models are semi empirical ones a few researchers developed elastic plastic models by introducing the parameter of accumulated deviatoric plastic strain into the hardening rule these models considered the complete strength loss of clay in the state of cyclic failure but cannot take into account strength degradation in the state of cyclic stability therefore a cyclic memory parameter was introduced to develop a post cyclic strength degradation bounding surface model this model was proposed based on the classical bounding surface model with a vanishing elastic region the post cyclic strength degradation was achieved by the shrinkage of the bounding surface during cyclic loading and the degradation is not unlimited under the control of the cyclic memory parameter the accuracy and validity of the proposed model were verified by comparing the predicted and the triaxial experimental results moreover the effectiveness of the model for predicting the cyclic and post cyclic shear characteristics of clay under various loading conditions was further demonstrated keywords soft clay cyclic loading post cyclic strength degradation bounding surface model numerical simulation 1 introduction there are many nearshore and offshore structures built on the saturated soft clay ground the stability of these structures which are subjected to kinds of cyclic loads such as waves storm surges and earthquakes during their service time rely on the stability of the soft clay foundation under cyclic loading previous researches showed that the excess pore pressure of the marine soft clay will accumulate under cyclic loading and the effective stress decreases and hence the phenomenon of the post cyclic strength degradation occurs andersen et al 1980 matsui et al 1992 yasuhara et al 1992 2004 yasuhara 1994 erken and ülker 2007 kaya and erken 2015 this characteristic of the marine soft clay affect the work performance and bearing capacity of the structures on the clay ground therefore it is of high significance to develop a proper constitutive model to precisely evaluate the strength degradation of the soft clay due to cyclic loading in the previous researches the constitutive models which can consider the strength degradation for clay under cyclic loading were mainly can divided into three categories the first type includes the models based on the iwan series model which considers the effect of the mean principle effective stress on model parameters puzrin et al 1995 or the models depend on the softening parameters proposed by idriss et al 1978 which describes the cyclic softening stress strain characteristics with masing rule rao and panda 1998 the second type was proposed based on the theory of equivalent overconsolidation for clay yasuhara et al 2003 soroush and soltani jigheh 2009 wang et al 2017 this type of model considered that the clay after cyclic loading behaves similar to the overconsolidated clay produced by real unloading these two models were developed specifically to simulate the strain softening behavior or strength degradation characteristic due to cyclic loading but some important dynamic characteristics such as dynamic deformation and cyclic pore pressure of the clay were ignored besides it is impossible for these models to consider the influence of the loading effective stress paths on the calculation results the third type of model is elastic plastic model mroz et al 1978 proposed a modified two surface model based on the isotropic and kinematic hardening criteria this model inserts a middle plane between the elastic kernel and the bounding surface and an accumulated deviatoric plastic strain was introduced in the hardening equation to achieve the shrinkage of the middle plane thereby achieving the prediction of the shear strength decreasing due to cyclic loading based on a generalized isotropic hardening criterion hu et al 2012 and hu and liu 2014 2015 established a damage single surface model to consider the cyclic softening of saturated clay this model introduced a damage variable in the hardening equation to characterize the degree of soil fabric damage and remodeling due to cyclic loading the models proposed by mroz and hu both use the parameter of plastic deviatoric strain to consider the effect of the cyclic loading on the shrinkage of yield surface or bounding surface when a clay specimen is sheared to failure whether in a monotonic shear test or a cyclic shear test the mapping point locates on the bounding surface where the deviatoric plastic strain increment is far larger than the volume strain increment leading to a large negative increment of hardening parameter in such condition the yield surface or bounding surface will shrink infinitely these models can consider the simulation of the complete strength loss of clay in the state of cyclic failure but it is impossible to take into account the strength degradation for clay in the state of cyclic stability liang and ma 1992 proposed a rotational hardening bounding surface model and introduced the plastic deviatoric strain in the plastic modulus formula to take into account the soil fabric remodeling effect on stiffness degradation wang and yao 1996 took the parameters of the bounding surface radius or the maximum elastic modulus at initial loading to describe the isotropic degradation of the soil although both models introduced the plastic deviatoric strain into the plastic modulus function avoiding the defects of the mroz and hu models they cannot predict the characteristics of post cyclic strength degradation simultaneously with the simulation of the stiffness degradation in addition the critical state model modified by carter et al 1982 on the basis of the cambridge model to introduce an additional function to explain the degradation of soil strength caused by cyclic loading this model has been further modified by indraratna et al 2015 and ni et al 2015 for better prediction of the cyclic behavior of soft clay these two models are based on the cambridge model and make some modifications which can characterize the cyclic behavior of clay to a certain extent however the prediction of the cyclic stress strain relationship by these two models is still not as accurate as that with the bounding surface model moreover shi et al 2018 proposed an hybrid plastic flow rule within the bounding surface framework which could consider the strength deterioration during earthquakes but a total of 8 additional parameters were introduced nie et al 2016 applied a constitutive model which has 12 parameters based on the bouc wen model and endochronic theory to investigate the stiffness and strength changes resulting from cyclic loading of granular soil the excessive parameters making these models difficult to be applied in practical application there are also other kinds of models like the discrete element method ravishankar et al 2009 to consider the post liquefaction undrained monotonic behavior of sands which has not been proved to be suitable for clay the degradation expression proposed by zhou and randolph 2015 was used to investigate the interpretation of cyclic t bar and ball penetrometer tests in soft clay the damage law estimated by pineda et al 2014 was used to represent the progressive degradation of the shear strength parameters as a function of the accumulated strain however these two models were mainly developed based on the experimental results and lack of theoretical basis the present work introduced a cyclic memory parameter considering the mechanism of strength degradation after cyclic loading to develop a modified bounding surface model based on the classical one with a vanishing elastic region this model can reasonably simulate the cyclic and monotonic shear properties of soft clay and consider the strength degradation of clay due to cyclic loading comparing to the traditional bounding surface model an additional parameter was introduced in the modified model avoiding excessive parameters and complicated hardening criteria it makes the model easily applied in the numerical application the accuracy and validity of the developed model were verified by comparing with the triaxial experimental data moreover the effectiveness of the proposed model was further demonstrated by predicting the cyclic and post cyclic shear characteristics of clay under various loading conditions 2 bounding surface model considering the post cyclic strength degradation the classical bounding surface model with a vanishing elastic region proposed by dafalias and popov 1975 can describe the dynamic characteristics of clay which was adopted in this paper as the framework of the proposed model for the purpose of clarify some concepts of the critical state model need to be briefly demonstrated the model can be applied to three dimensional numerical calculation and thus the tensor quantities are used to express the formulation of the model the detail of critical state concept and the derivation of the basic formula e g equations 1 10 can be found in the literature schofield 1968 wood 1990 manzari and dafalias 1997 the following eq 1 is the calculation formula for the first effective stress invariant p and the eq 2 is the calculation formula for the volume strain ε v the repeated indices imply the summation convention 1 p σ 11 σ 22 σ 33 3 1 3 σ i i 2 ε v ε 11 ε 22 ε 33 ε i i the definition of deviator parts of stress and strain tensors are shown as the following equations 3 s i j σ i j p δ i j 4 e i j ε i j 1 3 ε v δ i j where δ ij denotes the kronecker delta which is the rank 2 identity tensor the definitions of stress and strain invariants used in this paper are as follows 5 q 3 2 s i j s i j 6 ε q 2 3 e i j e i j in triaxial tests since the σ 2 σ 3 the deviatoric axial stress q σ 1 σ 3 and the mean effective principal stress p σ 1 2σ 3 3 2 1 elastic strain the strain tensor increments can be decomposed into an elastic strain increment part and a plastic strain increment part as shown in eq 7 7 d ε i j d ε i j e d ε i j p where dε ij dε ij e and dε ij p are the total strain tensor increment the elastic strain tensor increment and the plastic strain tensor increment respectively according to generalized hooke s law the stress strain relationship of the soil should satisfy the eq 8 and eq 9 8 d p k ε v e k d ε v d ε v p 9 d s i j 2 g d e i j e 2 g d e i j d e i j p where k is the bulk modulus and g is the shear modulus according to the critical state theory the values of k and g depend on the current stress state and the current void ratio the calculation formulas of k and g are shown in eq 10 and eq 11 10 k 1 e κ p 11 g 3 k 2 1 2 μ 1 μ where κ is the slope of swelling line in the e lnp plane μ is the poisson s ratio and e is the void ratio 2 2 bounding surface and loading surface equations the bounding surface equation is in the form of an ellipse which is consistent with the modified cambridge model as shown in eq 12 12 f σ i j p 0 s i j s i j 2 3 m 2 p p 0 p 0 where s i j and p are the image deviatoric stress tensor and mean effective pressure tensor on the bounding surface mapped by the current stress point the p 0 is the hardening parameter of the bounding surface indicating the size of the bounding surface the m is the slope of the critical state line which indicates the stress ratio q p at failure and can be obtained by triaxial compression tests the loading surface equation form is the same as that of the bounding surface as shown in eq 13 13 f σ i j p 1 s i j s i j 2 3 m 2 p p 1 p 0 where s i j is the deviatoric stress tensor at the current stress point p 1 is the parameter of loading surface indicating the size of the loading surface 2 3 mapping rule and flow rule the mapping rule should be defined for bounding surface model to determine the location of the image stress point in the bounding surface in the current model the radial mapping rule proposed by dafalias 1986 and applied by most of the bounding surface models is used the projection center is assumed as the origin of the stress space therefore the plastic modulus in the current stress point can be calculated and the plastic flow direction of the current stress point is consistent with the normal direction of the image stress point in the bounding surface model the position of the current stress point a and the image stress point a in the p q stress space can be shown in fig 1 and the mapping rule is defined by the following relation 14 σ i j β σ i j where β is a parameter defining the distance between the loading surface and bounding surface the formula for calculating the plastic strain increment is as follows 15 d ε i j p d λ r i j where dλ is the plastic multiplier the r ij is the second order tensor representing the direction of plastic strain increment in stress space the denotes the macauley bracket making d λ non negative when d λ 0 d λ d λ when d λ 0 d λ 0 the dλ can be calculated by the following formula 16 d λ 1 k p l i j d σ i j 1 k p l i j d σ i j where l ij is the loading direction at the current stress point k p is the plastic modulus at the current stress point k p is the plastic modulus at the image stress point if the associated flow rule is applied r ij can be calculated by the eq 17 17 r i j l i j f σ i j the eq 18 can be obtained by substituting eq 14 and eq 17 into eq 15 and then the value and direction of the plastic strain increment of the model can be obtained 18 d ε v p 1 k p f σ i j d σ i j f p d e i j p 1 k p f σ i j d σ i j f s i j 2 4 modified hardening rule the hardening law was modified to consider the shrinkage of bounding surface during cyclic loading based on the relationship between the strength degradation and the effective stress reduction during cycling so that the bounding surface model can reasonably describe the cyclic and post cyclic characteristics of clay carter et al 1982 used a simple method to modify the cambridge model to consider the plastic deformation within the yield surface it assumed that the increase in accumulative plastic strain and cyclic effect are caused by the change in the yield surface size during the elastic unloading in the current model the method of carter was employed and modified as shown in fig 1 point a is the current stress point and it is on the loading surface when it continues to load at the point a the isotropic expansion of the loading surface along the direction of i occurs at this point an isotopic hardening law of eq 19 is used and the plastic strain at point a increases 19 d p 0 p 0 ν λ κ d ε v p where v is current specific volume λ is the slope of the normal consolidation line in the e lnp plane when it is unloaded at the stress point of a the loading surface will shrink along the direction ii the hardening parameter p 1 of the loading surface will decrease at this point the parameter p 0 of the bounding surface decreases due to the shrinkage of the loading surface the relationship between the change rate of p 0 and p 1 satisfies the eq 20 20 d p 0 p 0 θ n d p 1 p 1 if θ is set to a constant like the cambridge model of carter et al 1982 the change rate of the parameter p 1 that controls the size of yield surface will gradually increase with the number of cycles increasing it is not applicable for the clay subjected to a small cyclic stress which can reach a state of cyclic stability the mean effective stress and the pore pressure of such clay will reach a stable value as well as the post cyclic strength degradation rate wang et al 2018 therefore the variation of θ needs to satisfy the following two conditions 1 the degradation rate of the bounding surface size p 0 should be positively related to the degradation rate of the effective mean pressure during cycling 2 after a sufficient number of cycles θ should tend to be zero so that the contraction rate of the bounding surface size p 0 tends to zero considering the above two conditions the eq 21 was introduced to control the change of θ so that the model can consider the strength degradation of the clay during the cyclic loading 21 θ n ω p i n 1 p p 0 where ω is a model degradation constant ω 0 which controls the degradation rate of the bounding surface size during cyclic loading p is the current mean effective pressure p i n 1 is the cyclic memory parameter representing the mean effective stress at the end of the n 1 th unloading process the physical meaning of the cyclic memory parameter can be explained with the triaxial tests as shown in fig 2 p i 0 is the maximum effective mean pressure during initial loading for clay specimen with the number of cycles increase the superscript value of p i n 1 increases and the value of p i n 1 decreases in a loading process of a cycle the p i n 1 keeps constant when the process of the nth unloading is finished and the loading reverses for next cyclic load the p i n 1 is updated to p i n according to previous researches the post cyclic strength of clay degrades with the decrease in the effective stress the formula of p i n 1 p p 0 characterize the effective stress reduction during process of loading and unloading because the strength degradation rate of different clays varies with the reduction rate in effective stress a parameter is needed to characterize the degradation rate of the clay which is the physical meaning of model degradation constant ω according to the analysis of eq 21 the parameter θ is positively correlated to the mean effective principle stress p of the two adjacent unloading process when the cyclic steady state is reached dθ n tends to be zero and the size of bounding surface keeps constant the above two conditions for θ is satisfied and the strength degradation under cyclic loading for clay is achieved in the current model 2 5 plastic modulus according to the traditional bounding surface theory dafalias and popov 1975 dafalias 1986 the plastic modulus of the current stress point can be determined by the distance between the current stress point and the image stress point in the current model the plastic modulus is in the following form proposed by dafalias 1986 for uniaxial loading 22 k p k p h p β 1 β where k p is the plastic modulus for the current stress point k p is the plastic modulus of the image stress point h is a scalar function and β is the ratio between the distance from image stress point to projection center and distance from current stress point of stress point to projection center the following relation can be obtained by applying the continuity equation to the bounding surface equation 23 f s i j d s i j f p d p f ε v p d ε v p 0 substituting eq 12 and eq 19 into the above equation the plastic modulus formula at the image stress point can be obtained 24 k p 8 9 m 4 ν λ κ p p 0 p 1 2 p 0 applying the formula suggested by manzari and nour 1997 for calculating the scalar function h the following equation can be obtained 25 h h 0 16 9 m 4 ν λ κ p 3 where h 0 is a model constant 3 validation studies 3 1 comparison between the prediction results and experimental data 3 1 1 ma 13 clay subjected to strain controlled cyclic loading in order to further verify the accuracy and validity of the developed model the post cyclic triaxial tests conducted by matsui et al 1992 were adopted in this section the tested clay specimens were undisturbed normal consolidated ma 13 clay the properties of the tested ma 13 clay are as follows specific gravity 2 67 initial water content 63 initial dry density 1 1 g cm3 liquid limit 72 5 plastic limit 27 9 and plasticity index 44 6 the confining pressure was 196 kpa and the total number of cycles was 100 the cyclic loading was strain controlled different cyclic axial strain amplitudes including 0 i e no cyclic history 0 486 0 991 and 1 922 were applied the required parameters for the model are shown in table 1 the comparisons between the predicted results and experimental data are shown in fig 3 fig 3 a illustrates the post cyclic undrained monotonic shear stress strain relation with different cyclic axial strain amplitudes although the results predicted by the model slightly deviate from the experimental results in the initial shear stage the prediction lines basically coincide with the experimental data with the progress of the shearing the characteristic that the post cyclic shear stiffness and strength decreases with the increase in the cyclic axial strain amplitudes can be accurately reflected the comparison of the measured and predicted post cyclic effective shear paths for the specimens under different cyclic axial strain amplitudes are demonstrated in fig 3 b c and d it shows that for the strain control cyclic triaxial tests the reduction in the deviator stress in each circle with the progressive cyclic loading can be observed which is resulted by the decreasing stiffness of clay after 100 times of cyclic loading the mean effective principle pressure reach a relative stability and the accumulated pore pressure also stabilizes the effective shear paths for specimens of ε d 0 486 and ε d 0 basically coincide with the test results but the shear paths of ε d 0 991 and ε d 1 922 not match well with the experimental results the phenomenon of the prediction results not matching well with the experimental data are mainly caused by the following two reason first the model is a theoretical model and is founded on the critical state theory resulting in that the model is not suitable to precisely simulate all properties of clay besides the existence of inconsistency in soil samples and test errors will lead fluctuation in the experimental results fig 4 a and b respectively show the experimental and predicted post cyclic shear induced pore pressure of normally consolidated ma 13 clay for the specimens with higher cyclic axial strain amplitudes the corresponding ultimate shear induced pore pressure is larger meanwhile the post cyclic shear pore pressure curves of ε d 0 991 and ε d 1 922 which rise at first and then decrease to a relatively stable value have the different forms with that of ε d 0 486 and ε d 0 which continue growing until a stable value reached above all the proposed model can reasonably predict the post cyclic shear characteristics especially the feature of strength and stiffness degradation due to cyclic loading for soft clay 3 1 2 lean clay with a low plasticity subjected to stress controlled cyclic loading the experiments conducted by yasuhara et al 2003 are used to further verify the correction of the modified bounding surface model the properties of the tested soil are as follows specific gravity of solids g s 2 787 liquid limit w l 38 6 and plasticity index i p 19 7 the soil which was called as low plasticity silt in the original paper can also be defined as a lean clay with low plasticity according to the united soil classification system the specimens with different normalized cyclic pore pressure δu p c 0 241 0 578 0 801 and specimen with no previous cyclic loading are used to validate the model these specimens are normally consolidated under the confining pressure p c 392 kpa after the isotropic normal consolidation and the stress controlled cyclic loading a monotonic undrained shearing process is applied to the soil to investigate the effect of cyclic loading history on the clay the required parameters for the model are shown in table 2 the comparisons between the predicted results and experimental data are shown in fig 5 fig 5 a illustrates the post cyclic undrained shear effective stress paths of experimental and predicted results fig 5 b shows the experimental and predicted stress strain curves under different normalized cyclic pore pressure the prediction results of the proposed model are slightly deviation from the experimental results but they all basically reflect the development of effective stress paths and stress strain relationship and effectively reflect the characteristics post cyclic undrained shear strength degradation of the soil which demonstrates the accuracy and validity of model the traditional method to estimate the post cyclic shear strength of clay is to use the semi empirical model proposed by yasuhara et al 2003 based on the equivalent overconsolidation concept the comparison between the experimental results and the results respectively predicted by the proposed model and yasuhara model are shown in fig 6 the test data of the post cyclic undrained strength ratio versus normalized excess pore pressure of the soil under the confining pressure of 192 kpa were carried out by yasuhara and toyota 1997 on the same type of soil as can be seen from the fig 6 the proposed model and yasuhara model have the similar predictions for the measured data and can both effectively predict the post cyclic undrained strength degradation of the soil however comparing to the equivalent overconsolidation model proposed by yasuhara the modified bounding surface model can also predict the effective stress path and stress strain relationship of the soil while predicting the strength degradation 3 2 cyclic memory parameter and model degradation constant through the above introduction of the cyclic memory parameter p i n it can be seen that this parameter is an internal variable therefore the parameters required for the developed model are divided into two groups the first group is the modified cambridge model parameters ie λ κ m which can be measured by the triaxial tests the other group consists of the bounding surface shape function constant h 0 and the surface model degradation constant ω introduced in this paper the strength degradation degree calculated by the current model is affected by both cyclic memory parameter and model degradation constant the parameter ω which determine the shrinkage rate of bounding surface size due to cycling characterizes the effect of effective stress reduction of the soil due to the increasing of accumulative pore pressure during cyclic loading on the strength degradation meanwhile the cyclic memory parameter which will reach a relative stable value under cyclic stability so does the size of the bounding surface the model parameters in table 3 are used for predicting the cyclic behavior of the soft clay to illustrate the meaning of the two parameters the loading condition concludes the confining pressure of 300 kpa and the cyclic stress amplitude of 50 kpa the parameter ω 3 2 1 0 is varied to demonstrate its influence on the size of bounding surface which can be represented by the hardening parameter p 0 the calculation results are showed in fig 7 comparing to the case without cyclic degradation ω 0 the ω introduced can effectively decrease the size of bounding surface and then determine the strength degradation rate due to cyclic loading for the soft clay it shows that after a specific number of cyclic loading the value of p 0 for the case with ω 0 is less than that with ω 0 meanwhile after a certain amount number of cycles the p 0 will not continue decreasing but reach a stable value except for the case with ω 3 the cyclic stability for the clay is achieved by the memory parameter p i n for the specimens with larger value of ω the constant value of p 0 cannot be reached and the cyclic failure occurs during cyclic loading therefore the value of ω can be determined according to the strength degradation degree of the clay under cyclic loading generally the value of ω can be calibrated by trial calculation of the post cyclic shear strength 3 3 prediction of post cyclic shear behavior and overconsolidated shear characteristic when the clay is subjected to the undrained cyclic loading the accumulated pore pressure will grow resulting in the decrease in the effective stress of the clay previous researches show that the clay after the cyclic loading may behave similar to the overconsolidated clay which refers to the phenomenon of equivalent overconsolidation andersen et al 1980 hyde and ward 1985 yasuhara et al 1992 1994 2003 therefore in this section the post cyclic shear behavior and the overconsolidated clay shear characteristic are predicted by the proposed model the model parameters in table 3 are used for the calculation the confining pressure for the normally consolidated clay equals to 300 kpa and the pre consolidation pressure of the overconsolidated clay is the same the comparison between the post cyclic shear of normally consolidated clay with different value of ω and the static shear of overconsolidated clay are shown in fig 8 their effective stress paths in p and q plane are illustrated in fig 8 a it can be seen that for the normally consolidated clay after cyclic loading its effective stress paths are similar with that of the overconsolidated clay with ω 0 the post cyclic shear path far exceeds that of the overconsolidated clay and the shear failure point of a post cyclic specimen coincide with that of specimen with no previous cycling however with the increase in the value of ω the post cyclic shear path is gradually approaching the path of an overconsolidated clay fig 8 b shows the prediction of the lnp versus e for post cyclic clay and overconsolidated clay in e lnp plane during undrained cyclic shear a normally consolidated clay specimen at point a approach to point b the specimen during the post cyclic shearing behaves in a similar manner to an overconsolidated clay specimen produced by unloading from point d to point b the shear failure points of post cyclic clay specimen locate on the line of ab and approach to that of an overconsolidated clay specimen with the increase of ω indicating a similar behavior to the overconsolidated clay the above calculation results all demonstrate that the proposed model can reasonably reflect the phenomenon of equivalent overconsolidation of the clay 3 4 prediction of post cyclic strength under different number of cycles in this section the prediction of the model for the post cyclic strength under different number of cycles was verified the model parameters in table 3 are used for the calculation and the value of the model degradation constant ω equals to 2 0 the confining pressure equaling to 300 kpa and the cyclic stress amplitude equaling to 100 kpa were applied the prediction results are shown in fig 9 the post cyclic shear failure criterion is set as 15 of the accumulated axial strain andersen et al 1980 for comparison the results for the case without cyclic loading history curve a also plotted in the fig 9 a and fig 9 b the cyclic and post cyclic effective stress paths under different number of cycles n in the p q plane are showed in fig 9 a it can be seen that with the gradually increasing number of cycles the mean effective principle stress p decreases the more number of cycles the smaller the p value at the initial post cyclic shear is the end points of the post cyclic shear paths located on the critical stress line csl their corresponding deviator stress at failure is less than that of curve a and decreases with the increase in the cyclic numbers the accumulated axial strain increases with the increase in the number of cycles and the post cyclic shear strength decreases with the number of cycles increasing which is consistent with that of wang et al 2018 as shown in fig 9 b moreover with the cyclic numbers increasing the initial post cyclic shearing stiffness decreases due to cyclic loading the relationship between the normalized post cyclic shear strength and the normalized accumulated cyclic pore pressure can be seen in fig 9 c the s u cy is the post cyclic shear strength and s u is the monotonic shear strength without previous cyclic loading the normalized post cyclic shear strength decreases with the increase in the normalized accumulated cyclic pore pressure besides the higher the accumulative pore pressure the larger the normalized strength degradation rate is fig 9 d illustrates the cyclic accumulative pore pressure development of the curve g for the clay specimens with the number of cycles less than 60 their cyclic pore pressure curves coincide with the curve g 3 5 prediction of post cyclic strength under different cyclic stress amplitude the purpose of this section is to evaluate the model for predicting the post cyclic strength under different cyclic stress level of soft clay the soil parameters in table 3 are applied and the value of ω equals 2 0 three different loading conditions are adopted and the confining pressure of 300 kpa is employed the cyclic stress amplitude q cy is applied as 50 kpa 100 kpa and 140 kpa for the first second and third loading condition respectively fig 10 a shows the relationship between the hardening parameter p 0 and the cyclic numbers it shows that under the same consolidation pressure the larger the cyclic stress amplitude the higher shrink rate of the bounding surface is when the cyclic stress level is large enough the cyclic failure can be reached in little cyclic number such as the third loading condition with the decrease in the cyclic stress level the shrinkage rate of the bounding surface decreases the stress strain curves for the first and third loading condition are showed in fig 10 c and fig 10 b respectively for the third loading condition the plastic axial strain in each cycle increases drastically and reach cyclic failure in few cycles however for the first loading condition which has a lower cyclic stress level the axial strain accumulates in a slow rate the 2 5 of axial strain is accumulated after the 1000th cycles and state of cyclic stability is reached fig 10 d illustrates the development of the cyclic pore pressure for different loading conditions it shows that with a higher cyclic stress level the cyclic pore pressure will accumulate in a high rate the larger the cyclic pore pressure the smaller mean effective principle stress is and thus the lower the post cyclic strength is 3 6 prediction of post cyclic strength under different confining pressure the prediction of the model for the post cyclic strength under different confining pressure is validated in this section the soil parameters in table 3 are adopted and the ω 2 is applied four different loading conditions are applied with cyclic stress amplitude q cy 100 kpa the confining pressure for different loading conditions are 300 kpa 350 kpa 400 kpa and 450 kpa for the first second third and fourth loading conditions respectively the clay in different loading conditions are conducted post cyclic shear tests after the 60th loading cycles the post cyclic effective stress paths for the four loading conditions are shown in fig 11 a for comparison the monotonic shear effective paths with corresponding confining pressure are also plotted it demonstrates that under the same cyclic loading cycles and cyclic stress amplitudes the post cyclic strength is lower than the corresponding static monotonic shear strength moreover the degradation rate increases with the increase in the confining pressure fig 11 b illustrates the development of the pore pressure during cycling for the first and the fourth loading condition the accumulated cyclic pore pressure increases gradually with progressive cyclic loading the increasing rate of the pore pressure is lower with a larger confining pressure 3 7 comparison of the results with different models in this section the prediction of the proposed model called mob is compared with that of different models the prediction results using the method considering the cyclic strength degradation by introducing the deviatoric plastic strain into the hardening rule mroz et al 1978 hu et al 2012 called midest is showed for contrast the bounding surface function loading surface function flow rule and mapping rule of midest model are consistent with that of mob model but a degradation parameter h is introduced into the hardening rule function as shown in eq 26 and the variation of h is related to the plastic deviatoric strain δe p as shown in eq 27 the δ is the midest model constant and set as 0 5 26 p 0 n 1 p 0 n exp ν λ κ δ ε p h n 1 h n 27 h n 1 h n exp δ δ 2 3 δ e n 1 p δ e n 1 p the post cyclic shear characteristics prediction results of mob and midest are illustrated in the fig 12 besides the cambridge model cmm and the bounding surface model bounds without modification are also included in fig 12 the post cyclic effective shear paths and the relationship of the deviator stress and axial strain for different types of model are plotted in the fig 12 a and fig 12 b respectively the model of cmm considers no plastic strain occurring within the yield surface therefore with the cyclic loading processing the cyclic effective stress paths coincide with the effective paths in the first unloading and reloading process which is not consistent with the experimental results the models of bounds mob and midest belong to the bounding surface model which can consider the development of plastic strain as the stress point within the bounding surface therefore the post cyclic shear behaviors are simulated when the same effective pressure is reached according to the simulation results the bounds can basically characterize the effect of cyclic loading however as discussed above the model of bounds cannot describe the post cyclic degradation behavior like mob although the model of midest can consider the shrink of bounding surface during cyclic loading the hardening parameter p 0 of the bounding surface will reduce to naught resulting in the unreasonable post cyclic effective shear path and stress strain curve when the clay is sheared to be failure the bounding surface model modified in this paper can reasonably predict the cyclic and post cyclic behavior of soft clay compared to the model which introduced the plastic deviatoric strain in the hardening law 4 conclusion in this paper a cyclic memory parameter was introduced in the hardening rule to develop a post cyclic strength degradation bounding surface model by considering the mechanism of strength degradation after cyclic loading the model has the following characteristics 1 this model is based on the classic bounding surface model with a vanishing elastic region and can correctly simulate the pore pressure behavior and stress strain hysteresis characteristics of the clay during cycling 2 the model introduces one new parameter model degradation constant allowing it to predict the post cyclic strength degradation of clay therefore it takes the advantage of few parameters and simple numerical integration method avoiding too much parameters and being applied complicatedly 3 the accuracy and validity of the proposed model have been verified by comparing the prediction results with the experimental data the estimated model can also reasonably indicate the phenomenon of equivalent overconsolidation of clay in addition the cyclic and post cyclic characteristics predicted by the proposed model under different number of cycles cyclic stress ratio and confining pressure are consistent with the experimental characteristics of clay 4 comparing to the previous models which added the plastic deviatoric strain in the hardening law the model in this paper can describe the post cyclic shear characteristics and strength degradation behavior of soft clay more reasonably it is worth noting that the bounding surface model proposed to describe the post cyclic strength degradation characteristics is suitable to the normally consolidated clays however whether the proposed model is suitable to the over consolidated clay or not needs further verification in addition the cyclic behavior of soft clay is drastically complex and the calculation results of the bounding surface model is only consistent with the actual test results in some degree the further modification of the model including the bounding surface formula plastic modulus interpolation formula and the cyclic degradation function is required to match the test results more accurately acknowledgments this work was supported by the national key research and development program of china grant number 2016yfc0802204 grant

22688,in this paper the added resistance of a large tanker is estimated experimentally and numerically in oblique sea experiments on ship motion response and added resistance in oblique sea are performed in the sspa seakeeping basin the experiments are conducted using the self propulsion test for seven wave directions between 180 and 0 in the self propulsion test the added resistance is estimated from the difference between the thrust of the propeller in calm water and waves in the case of the head sea the results are compared with those obtained from the captive test at the towing test of seoul national university as numerical method two methods are selected the strip method and the 3d rankine panel method the maximum value of the added resistance is observed between the incident wave directions of 180 and 150 from 120 the added resistance tends to decrease and the peak of the added resistance shifted to the short waves through the two numerical analysis methods the tendency of added resistance and the cause of the change of the added resistance in the oblique sea are investigated keywords added resistance oblique seas strip method rankine panel method self propulsion test captive test 1 introduction added resistance is the increased resistance to winds and waves in seaways compared to resistance in calm sea in recent years there has been an increasing interest on added resistance from the perspective of the energy efficiency design index eedi of the marine environment protection committee mepc for reducing the fuel consumption of a ship during operation in seaways however most research has studied the added resistance in head sea condition with little data on oblique sea conditions therefore existing researches on the added resistance in the oblique sea conditions were examined and the tendency of the added resistance in the oblique sea was studied through both experiments and numerical analysis the three approaches for analyzing the added resistance in waves are experimental numerical and empirical the experimental approach has high fidelity but it is expensive and time consuming the advantage of the empirical formula is that the added resistance can be easily obtained but the accuracy is not high the numerical approach can be further divided into three methods the slender body 3d panel and computational fluid dynamics cfd methods the slender body method can analyze the added resistance in a short time compared with the other two techniques but it has a limit in accuracy the cfd method has a disadvantage in that it takes a lot of time the 3d panel method is widely used because it has a relatively short computation time and high accuracy of added resistance as mentioned above many studies have been conducted on the added resistance of ships in the head wave condition storm tejsen et al 1973 experimentally identified the added resistance characteristics of series 60 ships for the s175 container ship fujii and takahashi 1975 and nakamura and naito 1977 performed added resistance experiments in various speed conditions with a generally good agreement between the two papers kashiwagi et al 2004 and kashiwagi 2013 computed the added resistance for several different ships sr221c 170kbc and slender and blunt modified wigley the estimation of added resistance through unsteady wave analysis is particularly noteworthy as the kvlcc2 ship is an open ship numerous researchers have used it for added resistance experiments guo and steen 2011 evaluated the added resistance of the kvlcc2 ship in short waves sadat hosseini et al 2013 predicted the added resistance of kvlcc2 in head sea and validated the data using cfd park et al 2015 studied the uncertainty of added resistance experiment in seafaring conditions lee et al 2017a conducted a series of tests to understand how different bow shapes influence added resistance in waves added resistance experiments of the kcs ship have also received substantial attention joncquez 2011 simonsen et al 2014 stocker 2016 findings indicate that added resistance experiment conducted in oblique sea conditions are fewer than those conducted under head sea condition fujii and takahashi 1975 investigated the added resistance on an s175 ship at 30 intervals in the direction of the incident wave kashiwagi et al 2004 presented experimental results of the added resistance for 170kbc recently valanto and hong 2015 measured the wave added resistance of the hsva cruise ship and discussed the effect of parametric roll on the added resistance stocker 2016 presented the added resistance data of the kcs ship in incident waves at 45 intervals there are two formulas for obtaining added resistance numerically the far field formulation using momentum conservation and the near field formulation using pressure integration the momentum conservation method was established by maruo 1960 it was later more developed by newman 1967 faltinsen et al 1980 applied the pressure integration method in the computation of added resistance at that time the far and near field formulations using the slender body theory were widely used owing to the improvement in computational ability of the computer far field and near field formulations were implemented using the 3d panel method joncquez 2009 studied the added resistance by applying momentum conservation and pressure integration methods based on the rankine panel method kim and kim 2011 and kim et al 2012 also used the momentum conservation and pressure integration methods for the added resistance problem analysis of the added resistance using cfd has become widespread in cfd an added resistance is obtained by subtracting the resistance in still water from the resistance in waves orihara and miyata 2003 solved the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation and developed a cfd that could assess the added resistance of ships with relative accuracy guo et al 2012 studied the added resistance of the kvlcc2 ship using rans equation and systematically verified the analysis results sadat hosseini et al 2013 compared the experimental and cfd results of the added resistance in the head sea condition yang and kim 2017 investigated the added resistance of kvlcc2 with a different bow shape using a cartesian grid method the cfd results in the head sea condition are satisfactory however in oblique sea conditions it is not easy to obtain cfd results because of computational burden the stawave i and ii and the national maritime research institute nmri methods are typically applied for predicting the added resistance by the empirical approach stawave i and ii methods were introduced by the maritime research institute netherlands marin to estimate added resistance with only limited ship information marin 2006 in the short waves fujii and takahashi 1975 used some complementary coefficients to derive semi empirical formulas the nmri suggested an enhanced formula based on fujii and takahashi s formula kuroda et al 2008 2012 tsujimoto et al 2008 whereby the complementary coefficients were modified using experimental data faltinsen et al 1980 developed an asymptotic formula and yang et al 2018 modified the formulation of faltinsen et al 1980 to consider the three aspects the finite draught of ship the local steady velocity and the shape above still water level liu and papanikolaou 2017a 2017b suggests an updated empirical formula for approximating the added resistance in head waves in the case of oblique sea the asymptotic formulae for short waves may be not appropriate since the both radiation and diffraction components can be important therefore mpec 70 inf30 2016 introduced the semi empirical formulae for the both radiation and diffraction components in oblique seas in this study the literature data of added resistance experiments are summarized and trends are investigated then the added resistance of a tanker is analyzed in oblique sea conditions using experimental and numerical analysis approaches experiments under head sea condition were conducted at the seoul national university snu towing tank and sspa seakeeping basin the experiment in the oblique sea conditions was done by the self propulsion test for seven wave directions between 180 and 0 as a numerical approach two methods were selected in the strip approach the momentum conservation method was applied to estimate the added resistance and asymptotic correction was added in the short waves condition in the rankine panel method the direct pressure integration method was used to estimate the added resistance 2 review of added resistance experiments experimental results of added resistance are useful to understand the characteristics of the added resistance and validate the results of numerical analysis experiments on the added resistance began in the 1970s and many model tests have since been conducted tables 1 and 2 summarize the added resistance experiments in the head sea and oblique sea conditions respectively based on the literature information available the corresponding results are illustrated in figs 1 and 3 the length l width b draft t block coefficient c b and speed of the ship fn are indicated in table 1 both tables show that while numerous ships have been examined in the head sea condition only limited ships have been studied in the oblique sea condition however ships operating in actual routes experience various head directions it is therefore important to understand the added resistance in the oblique sea conditions table 1 reveals that the added resistance experiments include ships varying from mathematical to similar to actual ships and actual ships the velocity of the ship also varies from fn 0 052 to 0 3 nonetheless the overall trend for added resistance in the head sea condition is similar as shown fig 1 for instance the maximum value of the added resistance appears at a slightly larger wavelength than the length of the ship as the wavelength increases the added resistance gradually reduces and it almost disappears at twice the wavelength of the ship in the short waves the added resistance is reduced and has an almost constant value however some experimental results show that the added resistance tends to increase again in the short waves region to explain this observation the ratio of added resistance to calm water resistance is illustrated schematically in fig 2 the data for this figure are based on the 1 100 scale kvlcc2 test model park et al 2015 as the test model size is increased the ratio of the added resistance to calm water resistance may change in general the added resistance experiment fixes the wave slope fig 2 shows the magnitude of added resistance for two wave slopes h λ 1 50 and 1 100 when the slope of the wave is kept constant the wave height becomes lower toward the short waves as the added resistance is proportional to the square of the wave height the added resistance is sharply reduced in the short waves at wave height h λ 1 50 and wavelength λ l 0 3 the added resistance is less than 7 of the calm water resistance under the h λ 1 100 condition and the same wavelength the added resistance is less than 2 of the calm water resistance at relatively shorter wavelengths λ l 0 1 the added resistance is further reduced fig 2 it is difficult to precisely measure the added resistance when it is less than 2 of the calm water resistance and it is also challenging to generate waves with a short length and low height for these reasons it seems that the increase in added resistance in the short waves will be affected by the experimental uncertainty fig 2 can also be used to determine the experimental conditions of added resistance there are five ships for the added resistance experiments in oblique sea conditions table 2 some experiments were conducted with the direction of incident waves at 30 intervals and others at 45 intervals therefore the number of ships to be compared differs according to the direction of the incident wave furthermore for the dtc ship experiments were performed only in the short waves and under low speed conditions this study investigated the variation in the added resistance for the direction of the incident wave at 30 intervals for the incident wave angle of 150 the experimental results of the four ships showed similar overall trends there are two characteristics of the added resistance under this condition the results of the hsva model showed a tendency to increase when the wavelength ratio was less than 0 3 and the results of the dtc ship showed a tendency to decrease and had a negative value since there is no measured data it is difficult to determine clearly why the two ship show different trends in the short wave region one common feature is that the peak of the added resistance is shifted to the short waves compared with the result of the head sea condition the added resistance increased in some ships compared to the head sea condition while in other ships it decreased the components of the added resistance can be roughly classified into a radiation related component and a pure diffraction component the pure diffraction component occupies most of the total added resistance in the short waves and the radiation related component occupies the majority of the total added resistance in the large motion response region the region where the peak of the added resistance appears is the region where the motion response is large therefore the shift of the peak of the added resistance seems to be related to the effect of the motion responses the surge sway and yaw motions are responses that do not have a restoring force and in turn do not have resonance the magnitude of these motions depends mostly on the magnitude of the wave excitation force conversely heave roll and pitch motions are responses with a restoring force as there is a resonance point the magnitude of the motion is closely related to the period of the incident wave as well as the magnitude of the wave excitation force in cases where the direction of the incident wave is changed the encounter frequency of the wave is also altered when the wave condition changes from the bow wave to the stern wave the resonance point moves to the short waves because the encounter frequency is reduced it can be seen that owing to this influence the peaks of the heave roll and pitch motions are shifted toward the short waves as the bow wave transitions to the stern wave as the resonance point moves to the short waves the peak of the relative motion also moves to the short waves this behavior is the reason why the peak of the added resistance has shifted to the short waves at 150 incident wave such as fig 3 a fig 3 b shows the added resistance of the 120 incident wave direction like in the 150 situation the region where the peak of the added resistance appeared shifted to the short waves and the added resistance decreased fig 3 c shows the added resistance results for the 90 incident wave direction which indicate two trends for the kcs ship the added resistance tended to increase continuously in the short waves the remaining ships showed small added resistance in the short waves in the section comparing the added resistance 6 added resistance the experimental data will be compared to the results of the numerical analysis to show the trends under the same condition fig 3 d 3 f show the results for the 60 0 incident wave directions as the incident wave is directed toward the following sea the added resistance tends to decrease furthermore in the following sea the negative added resistance was measured under some experimental conditions there are several possible mechanism or reasons e g stronger pressure recovery due to interaction between the ship stern flow and following waves and measurement error however it is not easy to identify the major source of such negative values thus far the characteristics of added resistance in oblique sea conditions have been discussed from several experimental results the maximum added resistance was observed between the incident wave directions of 180 and 150 for the 150 condition there were some ships where the added resistance was increased compared with the head sea condition while in other ships it decreased in the oblique sea conditions the peak of the added resistance shifted to the short waves and the magnitude showed a tendency to decrease the added resistance was small in value between incident wave angles 60 and 0 3 numerical approach in this paper the added resistance is numerically analyzed using two methods the first approach is the momentum conservation method based on strip theory in the frequency domain the second approach is the direct pressure integration method based on the 3d rankine panel method in the time domain 3 1 strip based method there are various methods for analyzing the added resistance in the frequency domain among them maruo s momentum conservation method is applied the formulation can be expressed as follows kashiwagi 1997 1 r a w 1 4 π k

the kochin function as follows 3 h k s h φ n φ n e k χ i ε k η k 2 k 2 i k ς d s ς η χ c k i ε k s k where ε k represents the sign of ω k u and can be expressed as follows 4 ε k sgn ω k u in addition the kochin function can be represented as a symmetric component and an asymmetric component as shown in eq 3 these components can be expressed as follows 5 h k 2 c k 2 s k 2 in this case c k and s k can be represented by eqs 6 and 7 respectively 6 c k c 7 k ω ω 0 g j 1 3 5 x j a c j k s k s 7 k ω ω 0 g j 2 4 6 x j a s j k where 7 c j k s h φ j n φ j n e k χ i k ς cos η k 2 k 2 d s s j k s h φ j n

r n m 4 m 5 m 6 n r u where u is the ship speed and ϕ 1 is the velocity potential of the incident wave therefore the kochin function can be calculated using the velocity potential obtained from the strip theory and the added resistance can be calculated using the added resistance equation eq 1 3 2 added resistance in short waves in short waves it is difficult to accurately estimate the added resistance using the strip method to compensate for this difficult faltinsen et al 1980 derived the asymptotic formula for added resistance of ships in short waves recently yang et al 2018 modified the formulation of faltinsen et al 1980 to consider the three aspects the finite draught of ship the local steady velocity and the shape above still water level in this study the modified faltinsen s formulation snu formula is used to estimate the added resistance in short waves the detailed derivation and investigation of the snu formulation is shown in yang et al 2018 3 3 3d rankine panel based method the direct pressure integration method is used to estimate the added resistance in rankine panel method the direct pressure integration method integrates the second order pressure on the mean body surface the second order force can be expressed as follows 10 f 2 w l 1 2 ρ g ζ ξ 3 ξ 4 y ξ 5 x 2 n sin α d l ρ w l u 1 2 φ φ ζ ξ 3 ξ 4 y ξ 5 x n 1 sin α d l ρ s b 1 2 ϕ i ϕ d ϕ i ϕ d n d s ρ s b

waterline and wetted surface of the mean body respectively n 1 and n 2 are the first and second order normal vectors respectively the above formulation is shown in vector format the average value of the x direction component is the added resistance further information about the formulation is provided in lee et al 2017b 4 experimental approach added resistance experiments were performed at snu towing tank and the sspa seakeeping basin in the snu towing tank added resistance experiments were conducted in the head sea condition while added resistance experiments were carried out at sspa basin in the oblique sea conditions as well as the head sea condition fig 4 a shows the layout of snu towing tank and fig 4 b is the layout of sspa basin in the case of snu towing tank the carriage can be moved at a speed of 0 1 4 5 m s and waves are generated by a plunger type wave maker in the captive test added resistance can be obtained through two steps i measurement of the calm water resistance r calm water ii measurement of the total resistance r wave in waves at the same speed the added resistance r aw can be obtained by subtracting the calm water resistance from the time averaged total resistance in waves r aw r wave r calm water in the case of sspa basin the towing carriage can move in the x and y directions with the speed of 0 3 5 m s the flap type wave maker is installed in the longitudinal and wide directions generating regular and irregular waves on the other side of the wave maker there is a beach that minimizes the reflection of incident waves as the sspa experiment was a self propulsion experiment a propeller and a rudder were installed in the self propulsion test added resistance can be obtained through two steps i measurement of the thrust in calm water t calm water ii measurement of the thrust in waves t wave at the same speed the added resistance r aw can be obtained by subtracting the thrust in calm water from the time averaged thrust with waves and multiplied by 1 t i e r aw t wave t calm water 1 t where t is the thrust reduction coefficient the thrust reduction coefficient can change in waves in this study however the thrust reduction coefficient in calm water is used owing to the assumption that the thrust reduction coefficient does not change much in the waves in this study the s vlcc tanker which was designed by samsung heavy industries was selected as the ship model the principal dimensions of the ship model are listed in table 3 in snu test a captive test was performed on a 1 100 scale model while a 1 68 scale model was used for the test at sspa basin obviously there is the scale effects for the two difference ships and such scale effects are under further study however in this study the direct comparison was made under the assumption that the scale effects are not significant fig 5 shows the two models which were used at snu towing tank and sspa basin the model of the snu towing tank had an extended vertical shape above deck line in order to study the change in the added resistance at high wave amplitude however the condition of this study are mild condition and there is no influence of deck extension on added resistance table 4 summarizes the experiment conditions the incident waves were at seven wave directions between 180 and 0 the snu experiment was done only in the head sea condition i e 180 there were ten wavelengths from 0 3 to 2 0 times the length of the ship two wave slope conditions were selected for the wavelength range of 0 3 0 9 the slope of the wave was set to 1 50 and for the wavelength range of 1 0 2 0 the slope of the wave was set to 1 100 the selection of the wave slope was determined from the ratio of the added resistance to the calm water resistance as fig 2 shows when the wave slope is low the added resistance is not easy to measure since the added resistance in short waves is very small compared with the calm water resistance instead when the wave slope is large the added resistance increases in the short waves however as the wavelength increases the added resistance sharply increases becoming twice as high as the calm water resistance in addition nonlinear characteristics such as green water generation at the bow and exposure of the bulbous bow above the free surface may occur for this reason experimental conditions were selected for the two wave slope conditions 5 motion responses the motion response of the ship was compared before comparing the added resistance in the oblique sea conditions six degrees of freedom motion occurs but in this study only three motion responses were analyzed the motions that have a great influence on the added resistance are heave roll and pitch motion responses as can be easily deduced from eq 10 the other three motion responses may influence the added resistance but the effect is not known to be significant when discussing the added resistance the effect of the three motions surge sway and yaw on the added resistance will be checked under one representative condition fig 6 shows the motion response in the head sea condition in the head sea condition there is no roll motion therefore only heave and pitch motion responses are compared in the experiments the phase of the motion response was not measured in this study only the magnitude of the motion response was compared the experimental results of sspa and snu were marked by symbols experiments at snu have been repeatedly performed under the same condition so several symbols are displayed under the same condition the experimental results are represented by different symbols according to the slope of the wave however this study used the linear method of numerical analysis and hence the numerical results are not changed by the slope of the wave the results of the rankine panel method are shown by a solid line and the strip method data are represented by a dotted line in these figures ω is the natural frequency of motion response the natural frequency of the motion response given by ω c m a where c is the restoring coefficient m and a are the mass and added mass respectively the natural frequency of the motion is one value but the wavelength at which the resonance occurs varies owing to the influence of the encounter frequency first experimental results of the heave motion response were compared in the region where the wavelength ratio is 1 3 or less the experimental results of snu and sspa agree well conversely the experimental results of sspa showed higher values than those of the numerical analysis in the region where the wavelength ratio is 1 3 or more pitch motion response showed the same tendency as the heave motion response in general the pitch motion response has a value of 1 when it is non dimensionalized by wave slope in the long wavelength region however the sspa test results showed a value greater than one at long wavelengths incident waves were not generated well in the long wavelength region due to the generation of the reflected waves from the side wall and the wall opposite to the wave maker the results of two numerical methods agree well with those of snu the peak of heave motion response occurred near the natural frequency for the pitch motion response the peak motion response occurred at a low frequency region than the natural frequency there are two reasons why the peak of motion response does not always occur near the natural frequency first the exciting force at the natural frequency could be small the peak of motion response could occur where the exciting force is large second the heave and pitch motions are strongly coupled the coupling term can shift the position of the resonance point fig 7 shows the experimental symbols rankine panel method solid lines and strip method dotted lines heave motion response data for the 150 0 incident wave directions the characteristics of the heave motion response according to the direction of the incident wave revealed the peak of the heave motion increased as the incident wave direction was changed from 150 to 90 the maximum value of the heave motion response occurred at a wavelength ratio of about 0 8 when the direction of the incident wave was 90 furthermore the peak of the heave motion response shifted to the short waves this is because the natural frequency of heave motion moved to the short waves in the quartering waves between 90 and 0 the natural frequency is located in the short waves the exciting force is very small in the short waves therefore no large motion response is observed the motion responses show similar shapes to those of the exciting forces the results of the two numerical analyses agree well with each other and the numerical analysis findings concurred with the experimental results fig 8 shows the roll motion responses the magnitude of roll motion response is highly affected by viscosity as the rankine panel method and the strip method which are numerical methods used in this study are based on potential theory the viscous roll damping cannot be considered therefore to account for the viscous force 3 the 3 is obtained through fitting with free roll decay test of the sspa experiment of the critical roll damping was considered as the viscous roll damping in the rankine panel method in time domain in the strip method viscous roll damping is considered by using the equivalent viscous damping coefficient in frequency domain the magnitude of the roll motion response is greatly affected by viscous roll damping in this study as the same coefficient was used for all incident wave directions some of the conditions corresponded well with the experimental results whereas others differed from the experimental results under the 150 condition the position of the resonance point agrees well with both the experimental and numerical results however at the resonance point the experimental results are smaller than the results of the strip method and show larger values than the rankine panel method as mentioned above the magnitude of the roll motion response is affected by viscous roll damping under the 120 condition the position of the resonance point is shifted to the short waves and its magnitude increased under the 90 and 30 conditions the roll motion response decreased sharply this tendency is similar to the tendency of the heave motion response the rankine panel method is a 3 d method and the strip method is a 2 d method the 2 d method has a limitation compared to a 3 d method also the viscous damping is the same in both methods but wave damping is different for this reason even with the same viscous damping the roll motion response may differ finally fig 9 shows the pitch motion responses the effective wave slope k a cos β is plotted as pink dashed lines on the fig 9 the pitch motion response in the long oblique waves approaches the effective wave slope lloyd 1989 the pitch motion response showed a tendency different from the heave and roll motion responses the pitch motion response decreased with a decrease in the incident wave angle from 150 to 90 the smallest magnitude of the motion response occurred under the 90 condition physically it is easy to guess that the pitch motion response decreases in the beam sea the pitch motion increased slightly at 60 at 30 and 0 the pitch motion responses were similar to each other the experimental and the rankine panel results agreed well with the overall conditions the strip method results showed some discrepancy near the natural frequency in this section the experimental results have been compared with the numerical results the characteristics of the motion response according to the direction of the incident wave were also examined the effect of this change in the motion response on the added resistance will be discussed in the following section 6 added resistance two experimental results snu and sspa and two numerical analysis results strip method and rankine panel method were compared in the head sea condition fig 10 shows the added resistance in the head sea condition the experimental results are presented for the rankine panel method solid line strip method corrected for a short waves dotted line and the short waves correction method snu formula one dot chain line different symbols are used according to the slope of wave as shown in section 2 there are many added resistance results in the head sea condition and the findings of this study showed a similar tendency to the general results the experiment results of sspa and snu were in good agreement in the region where the wavelength ratio is greater than 1 3 the heave and pitch motion responses of sspa showed larger values than those of snu as shown in fig 6 however the added resistance of sspa is only slightly bigger than that of snu the rankine panel method data were in good agreement with the experimental results the strip method showed larger values than the experimental results at wavelengths longer than the length of the ship the results of snu formula in the short waves showed similar values to the experimental results fig 11 shows the added resistance from 150 to 0 in the direction of the incident wave the experimental results and the results of the numerical results will be discussed from two perspectives first the trends in the results of added resistance experiments in oblique sea conditions will be investigated second the applicability of numerical methods and the short waves correction method in oblique sea conditions will be discussed when the direction of the incident wave is 150 the peak of the added resistance experiment increases and the position shifts to the short waves as compared with the 180 condition this tendency is consistent with that shown in fig 3 the rankine panel method data were in good agreement with the experimental data conversely although the strip method results were consistent with trends the added resistance was larger than the experimental results the snu formula results in the short waves showed small values than the experimental results experimental results at the 120 condition showed the same tendency as the added resistance of the other ships shown in fig 3 the position of the peak moved to the short waves and the added resistance decreased the rankine panel method results showed a similar tendency but higher added resistance than the experimental results in the region where the peak of the added resistance appeared the effect of surge sway and yaw motions on the added resistance was also investigated in the 120 condition to investigate the effect of the motion response on the added resistance the motion is restrained and the added resistance was calculated the results are shown in fig 11 b when each motion was restrained the added resistance did not change much this means that the three motion responses surge sway and yaw do not have a significant effect on the added resistance at fn 0 137 condition additional researches are needed to determine the effect of three motion responses on the added resistance for various speeds of various ship types the strip method results showed a large added resistance the value of snu formula results in the short waves were small than the value of experimental results the snu formula is a method of correcting the diffraction component among the components of the added resistance in the short waves in order to know the ratio of the diffraction component in the added resistance the added resistance component was analyzed fig 12 shows the components of added resistance using the rankine panel method the pure diffraction component is obtained in all motion constrained condition and the radiation related component is obtained by subtracting the pure diffraction component from the total added resistance therefore the radiation related component is the sum of the pure radiation component and the coupling term of the radiation and diffraction components the pure diffraction component of added resistance shows no significant change from 180 to 120 conditions for the 90 condition it shows a tendency to decrease gradually the radiation related component shows a tendency of the peak position to move to the short waves for the 60 condition it shows a small value without a distinct peak position in the head sea condition the snu formula method is useful because the pure diffraction component occupies most of the added resistance in the short waves as shown in fig 12 however as the direction of the incident wave moves from the head sea to the beam sea the component with the large motion response also moves to the short waves this trend can be seen in the motion responses shown in figs 8 10 therefore the radiation related component has a significant influence on the added resistance in the short waves as observed in fig 12 b owing to these effects the experimental data have a different tendency to the snu formula results in the short waves in the beam sea the peak of the added resistance is moved to the wavelength ratio 0 7 and the magnitude was reduced compared with fig 3 c the added resistance of other ships showed a similar trend the rankine panel method data agreed well with the experimental results the trend of the strip method agreed with the experimental trend but showed a difference in the short waves the snu formula presented different outcomes from the experimental results the snu formula seems to have a limitation in predicting the short waves added resistance when the incident wave direction is less than 90 for the 60 condition the added resistance is greatly reduced the results of rankine panel method agreed well with the experimental results whereas the results of the strip method showed differences in the short waves the snu formula showed a value close to zero at conditions of 60 0 experimental results of this study showed a tendency different from that of other ships in fig 3 e when the incident wave direction is 30 in fig 3 e the added resistance did not increase in the short waves which is opposite to findings in this study as shown in fig 11 e the added resistance by the rankine panel method did not increase in the short waves considering these facts there seems to be a problem in the experiment at the 30 condition additional research is needed to clarify this part the added resistance of the strip method showed a peak at a wavelength ratio of 0 8 this peak is related to the τ ωu g 0 25 condition in the frequency domain program strip the effect of τ was apparent but in the time domain rankine panel method the effect of τ was not apparent furthermore the effect of τ was not apparent in the experimental results in the following sea condition both the experiment and rankine panel method showed small added resistances the strip method showed a peak in the short waves due to the effect of τ 0 25 the polar diagrams in figs 13 15 are shown to understand the trend of the overall added resistance in the diagrams the θ direction indicates the direction of the incident wave and the r direction indicates the wavelength ratio fig 13 shows the added resistance obtained from the experiment large added resistance values were observed in the direction of the incident wave between 150 and 180 and the wavelength of the incident wave was similar to the length of the ship the added resistance tends to decrease gradually from 120 to 0 in the direction of the incident wave fig 14 shows the added resistance using the strip method the overall shape is similar but the magnitude is larger compared to the experimental results the effect of τ 0 25 is shown in the following sea conditions fig 15 shows the added resistance using the rankine panel method which is generally consistent with the experimental results 7 conclusions in order to understand the tendency of added resistance in oblique sea conditions experimental results published in the literature were observed and a thorough study was carried out for a ship model particularly both experimental and computational studies were carried out for a commercial large tanker the experiments were carried out by snu and sspa and two numerical approaches strip and rankine panel methods were applied for numerical computation based on the present study the following conclusions were made comparing the results of the added resistance experiments of various ships there is a consistent tendency on the direction of the incident wave between 180 and 120 at the head sea β 180 the peak of added resistance appears at a lightly larger wavelength than the length of the ship from 180 to 120 the peak of added resistance is shifted to the short waves region between 90 and 0 conditions added resistance becomes much small and scattered in the experimental results of a tanker at design speed the maximum added resistance was observed between the incident wave directions of 180 and 150 the added resistance between 120 and 90 conditions gradually decreased and between 60 and 0 conditions showed a small value without a clear trend in the oblique sea conditions of a tanker at design speed the computational results of the present rankine panel method data agreed well with the experimental results the strip method results showed a similar tendency to the experimental results but the added resistance was greater than the experimental results in the oblique sea conditions the peak frequency of the motion response moves and the radiation related component of added resistance can increases even in short waves in order to predict the added resistance of the short wave length region in the oblique sea it is important to predict the radiation related component as well as diffraction component acknowledgment this research was supported by the lrf funded research center at seoul national university south korea project number

22688,in this paper the added resistance of a large tanker is estimated experimentally and numerically in oblique sea experiments on ship motion response and added resistance in oblique sea are performed in the sspa seakeeping basin the experiments are conducted using the self propulsion test for seven wave directions between 180 and 0 in the self propulsion test the added resistance is estimated from the difference between the thrust of the propeller in calm water and waves in the case of the head sea the results are compared with those obtained from the captive test at the towing test of seoul national university as numerical method two methods are selected the strip method and the 3d rankine panel method the maximum value of the added resistance is observed between the incident wave directions of 180 and 150 from 120 the added resistance tends to decrease and the peak of the added resistance shifted to the short waves through the two numerical analysis methods the tendency of added resistance and the cause of the change of the added resistance in the oblique sea are investigated keywords added resistance oblique seas strip method rankine panel method self propulsion test captive test 1 introduction added resistance is the increased resistance to winds and waves in seaways compared to resistance in calm sea in recent years there has been an increasing interest on added resistance from the perspective of the energy efficiency design index eedi of the marine environment protection committee mepc for reducing the fuel consumption of a ship during operation in seaways however most research has studied the added resistance in head sea condition with little data on oblique sea conditions therefore existing researches on the added resistance in the oblique sea conditions were examined and the tendency of the added resistance in the oblique sea was studied through both experiments and numerical analysis the three approaches for analyzing the added resistance in waves are experimental numerical and empirical the experimental approach has high fidelity but it is expensive and time consuming the advantage of the empirical formula is that the added resistance can be easily obtained but the accuracy is not high the numerical approach can be further divided into three methods the slender body 3d panel and computational fluid dynamics cfd methods the slender body method can analyze the added resistance in a short time compared with the other two techniques but it has a limit in accuracy the cfd method has a disadvantage in that it takes a lot of time the 3d panel method is widely used because it has a relatively short computation time and high accuracy of added resistance as mentioned above many studies have been conducted on the added resistance of ships in the head wave condition storm tejsen et al 1973 experimentally identified the added resistance characteristics of series 60 ships for the s175 container ship fujii and takahashi 1975 and nakamura and naito 1977 performed added resistance experiments in various speed conditions with a generally good agreement between the two papers kashiwagi et al 2004 and kashiwagi 2013 computed the added resistance for several different ships sr221c 170kbc and slender and blunt modified wigley the estimation of added resistance through unsteady wave analysis is particularly noteworthy as the kvlcc2 ship is an open ship numerous researchers have used it for added resistance experiments guo and steen 2011 evaluated the added resistance of the kvlcc2 ship in short waves sadat hosseini et al 2013 predicted the added resistance of kvlcc2 in head sea and validated the data using cfd park et al 2015 studied the uncertainty of added resistance experiment in seafaring conditions lee et al 2017a conducted a series of tests to understand how different bow shapes influence added resistance in waves added resistance experiments of the kcs ship have also received substantial attention joncquez 2011 simonsen et al 2014 stocker 2016 findings indicate that added resistance experiment conducted in oblique sea conditions are fewer than those conducted under head sea condition fujii and takahashi 1975 investigated the added resistance on an s175 ship at 30 intervals in the direction of the incident wave kashiwagi et al 2004 presented experimental results of the added resistance for 170kbc recently valanto and hong 2015 measured the wave added resistance of the hsva cruise ship and discussed the effect of parametric roll on the added resistance stocker 2016 presented the added resistance data of the kcs ship in incident waves at 45 intervals there are two formulas for obtaining added resistance numerically the far field formulation using momentum conservation and the near field formulation using pressure integration the momentum conservation method was established by maruo 1960 it was later more developed by newman 1967 faltinsen et al 1980 applied the pressure integration method in the computation of added resistance at that time the far and near field formulations using the slender body theory were widely used owing to the improvement in computational ability of the computer far field and near field formulations were implemented using the 3d panel method joncquez 2009 studied the added resistance by applying momentum conservation and pressure integration methods based on the rankine panel method kim and kim 2011 and kim et al 2012 also used the momentum conservation and pressure integration methods for the added resistance problem analysis of the added resistance using cfd has become widespread in cfd an added resistance is obtained by subtracting the resistance in still water from the resistance in waves orihara and miyata 2003 solved the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation and developed a cfd that could assess the added resistance of ships with relative accuracy guo et al 2012 studied the added resistance of the kvlcc2 ship using rans equation and systematically verified the analysis results sadat hosseini et al 2013 compared the experimental and cfd results of the added resistance in the head sea condition yang and kim 2017 investigated the added resistance of kvlcc2 with a different bow shape using a cartesian grid method the cfd results in the head sea condition are satisfactory however in oblique sea conditions it is not easy to obtain cfd results because of computational burden the stawave i and ii and the national maritime research institute nmri methods are typically applied for predicting the added resistance by the empirical approach stawave i and ii methods were introduced by the maritime research institute netherlands marin to estimate added resistance with only limited ship information marin 2006 in the short waves fujii and takahashi 1975 used some complementary coefficients to derive semi empirical formulas the nmri suggested an enhanced formula based on fujii and takahashi s formula kuroda et al 2008 2012 tsujimoto et al 2008 whereby the complementary coefficients were modified using experimental data faltinsen et al 1980 developed an asymptotic formula and yang et al 2018 modified the formulation of faltinsen et al 1980 to consider the three aspects the finite draught of ship the local steady velocity and the shape above still water level liu and papanikolaou 2017a 2017b suggests an updated empirical formula for approximating the added resistance in head waves in the case of oblique sea the asymptotic formulae for short waves may be not appropriate since the both radiation and diffraction components can be important therefore mpec 70 inf30 2016 introduced the semi empirical formulae for the both radiation and diffraction components in oblique seas in this study the literature data of added resistance experiments are summarized and trends are investigated then the added resistance of a tanker is analyzed in oblique sea conditions using experimental and numerical analysis approaches experiments under head sea condition were conducted at the seoul national university snu towing tank and sspa seakeeping basin the experiment in the oblique sea conditions was done by the self propulsion test for seven wave directions between 180 and 0 as a numerical approach two methods were selected in the strip approach the momentum conservation method was applied to estimate the added resistance and asymptotic correction was added in the short waves condition in the rankine panel method the direct pressure integration method was used to estimate the added resistance 2 review of added resistance experiments experimental results of added resistance are useful to understand the characteristics of the added resistance and validate the results of numerical analysis experiments on the added resistance began in the 1970s and many model tests have since been conducted tables 1 and 2 summarize the added resistance experiments in the head sea and oblique sea conditions respectively based on the literature information available the corresponding results are illustrated in figs 1 and 3 the length l width b draft t block coefficient c b and speed of the ship fn are indicated in table 1 both tables show that while numerous ships have been examined in the head sea condition only limited ships have been studied in the oblique sea condition however ships operating in actual routes experience various head directions it is therefore important to understand the added resistance in the oblique sea conditions table 1 reveals that the added resistance experiments include ships varying from mathematical to similar to actual ships and actual ships the velocity of the ship also varies from fn 0 052 to 0 3 nonetheless the overall trend for added resistance in the head sea condition is similar as shown fig 1 for instance the maximum value of the added resistance appears at a slightly larger wavelength than the length of the ship as the wavelength increases the added resistance gradually reduces and it almost disappears at twice the wavelength of the ship in the short waves the added resistance is reduced and has an almost constant value however some experimental results show that the added resistance tends to increase again in the short waves region to explain this observation the ratio of added resistance to calm water resistance is illustrated schematically in fig 2 the data for this figure are based on the 1 100 scale kvlcc2 test model park et al 2015 as the test model size is increased the ratio of the added resistance to calm water resistance may change in general the added resistance experiment fixes the wave slope fig 2 shows the magnitude of added resistance for two wave slopes h λ 1 50 and 1 100 when the slope of the wave is kept constant the wave height becomes lower toward the short waves as the added resistance is proportional to the square of the wave height the added resistance is sharply reduced in the short waves at wave height h λ 1 50 and wavelength λ l 0 3 the added resistance is less than 7 of the calm water resistance under the h λ 1 100 condition and the same wavelength the added resistance is less than 2 of the calm water resistance at relatively shorter wavelengths λ l 0 1 the added resistance is further reduced fig 2 it is difficult to precisely measure the added resistance when it is less than 2 of the calm water resistance and it is also challenging to generate waves with a short length and low height for these reasons it seems that the increase in added resistance in the short waves will be affected by the experimental uncertainty fig 2 can also be used to determine the experimental conditions of added resistance there are five ships for the added resistance experiments in oblique sea conditions table 2 some experiments were conducted with the direction of incident waves at 30 intervals and others at 45 intervals therefore the number of ships to be compared differs according to the direction of the incident wave furthermore for the dtc ship experiments were performed only in the short waves and under low speed conditions this study investigated the variation in the added resistance for the direction of the incident wave at 30 intervals for the incident wave angle of 150 the experimental results of the four ships showed similar overall trends there are two characteristics of the added resistance under this condition the results of the hsva model showed a tendency to increase when the wavelength ratio was less than 0 3 and the results of the dtc ship showed a tendency to decrease and had a negative value since there is no measured data it is difficult to determine clearly why the two ship show different trends in the short wave region one common feature is that the peak of the added resistance is shifted to the short waves compared with the result of the head sea condition the added resistance increased in some ships compared to the head sea condition while in other ships it decreased the components of the added resistance can be roughly classified into a radiation related component and a pure diffraction component the pure diffraction component occupies most of the total added resistance in the short waves and the radiation related component occupies the majority of the total added resistance in the large motion response region the region where the peak of the added resistance appears is the region where the motion response is large therefore the shift of the peak of the added resistance seems to be related to the effect of the motion responses the surge sway and yaw motions are responses that do not have a restoring force and in turn do not have resonance the magnitude of these motions depends mostly on the magnitude of the wave excitation force conversely heave roll and pitch motions are responses with a restoring force as there is a resonance point the magnitude of the motion is closely related to the period of the incident wave as well as the magnitude of the wave excitation force in cases where the direction of the incident wave is changed the encounter frequency of the wave is also altered when the wave condition changes from the bow wave to the stern wave the resonance point moves to the short waves because the encounter frequency is reduced it can be seen that owing to this influence the peaks of the heave roll and pitch motions are shifted toward the short waves as the bow wave transitions to the stern wave as the resonance point moves to the short waves the peak of the relative motion also moves to the short waves this behavior is the reason why the peak of the added resistance has shifted to the short waves at 150 incident wave such as fig 3 a fig 3 b shows the added resistance of the 120 incident wave direction like in the 150 situation the region where the peak of the added resistance appeared shifted to the short waves and the added resistance decreased fig 3 c shows the added resistance results for the 90 incident wave direction which indicate two trends for the kcs ship the added resistance tended to increase continuously in the short waves the remaining ships showed small added resistance in the short waves in the section comparing the added resistance 6 added resistance the experimental data will be compared to the results of the numerical analysis to show the trends under the same condition fig 3 d 3 f show the results for the 60 0 incident wave directions as the incident wave is directed toward the following sea the added resistance tends to decrease furthermore in the following sea the negative added resistance was measured under some experimental conditions there are several possible mechanism or reasons e g stronger pressure recovery due to interaction between the ship stern flow and following waves and measurement error however it is not easy to identify the major source of such negative values thus far the characteristics of added resistance in oblique sea conditions have been discussed from several experimental results the maximum added resistance was observed between the incident wave directions of 180 and 150 for the 150 condition there were some ships where the added resistance was increased compared with the head sea condition while in other ships it decreased in the oblique sea conditions the peak of the added resistance shifted to the short waves and the magnitude showed a tendency to decrease the added resistance was small in value between incident wave angles 60 and 0 3 numerical approach in this paper the added resistance is numerically analyzed using two methods the first approach is the momentum conservation method based on strip theory in the frequency domain the second approach is the direct pressure integration method based on the 3d rankine panel method in the time domain 3 1 strip based method there are various methods for analyzing the added resistance in the frequency domain among them maruo s momentum conservation method is applied the formulation can be expressed as follows kashiwagi 1997 1 r a w 1 4 π k

the kochin function as follows 3 h k s h φ n φ n e k χ i ε k η k 2 k 2 i k ς d s ς η χ c k i ε k s k where ε k represents the sign of ω k u and can be expressed as follows 4 ε k sgn ω k u in addition the kochin function can be represented as a symmetric component and an asymmetric component as shown in eq 3 these components can be expressed as follows 5 h k 2 c k 2 s k 2 in this case c k and s k can be represented by eqs 6 and 7 respectively 6 c k c 7 k ω ω 0 g j 1 3 5 x j a c j k s k s 7 k ω ω 0 g j 2 4 6 x j a s j k where 7 c j k s h φ j n φ j n e k χ i k ς cos η k 2 k 2 d s s j k s h φ j n

r n m 4 m 5 m 6 n r u where u is the ship speed and ϕ 1 is the velocity potential of the incident wave therefore the kochin function can be calculated using the velocity potential obtained from the strip theory and the added resistance can be calculated using the added resistance equation eq 1 3 2 added resistance in short waves in short waves it is difficult to accurately estimate the added resistance using the strip method to compensate for this difficult faltinsen et al 1980 derived the asymptotic formula for added resistance of ships in short waves recently yang et al 2018 modified the formulation of faltinsen et al 1980 to consider the three aspects the finite draught of ship the local steady velocity and the shape above still water level in this study the modified faltinsen s formulation snu formula is used to estimate the added resistance in short waves the detailed derivation and investigation of the snu formulation is shown in yang et al 2018 3 3 3d rankine panel based method the direct pressure integration method is used to estimate the added resistance in rankine panel method the direct pressure integration method integrates the second order pressure on the mean body surface the second order force can be expressed as follows 10 f 2 w l 1 2 ρ g ζ ξ 3 ξ 4 y ξ 5 x 2 n sin α d l ρ w l u 1 2 φ φ ζ ξ 3 ξ 4 y ξ 5 x n 1 sin α d l ρ s b 1 2 ϕ i ϕ d ϕ i ϕ d n d s ρ s b

waterline and wetted surface of the mean body respectively n 1 and n 2 are the first and second order normal vectors respectively the above formulation is shown in vector format the average value of the x direction component is the added resistance further information about the formulation is provided in lee et al 2017b 4 experimental approach added resistance experiments were performed at snu towing tank and the sspa seakeeping basin in the snu towing tank added resistance experiments were conducted in the head sea condition while added resistance experiments were carried out at sspa basin in the oblique sea conditions as well as the head sea condition fig 4 a shows the layout of snu towing tank and fig 4 b is the layout of sspa basin in the case of snu towing tank the carriage can be moved at a speed of 0 1 4 5 m s and waves are generated by a plunger type wave maker in the captive test added resistance can be obtained through two steps i measurement of the calm water resistance r calm water ii measurement of the total resistance r wave in waves at the same speed the added resistance r aw can be obtained by subtracting the calm water resistance from the time averaged total resistance in waves r aw r wave r calm water in the case of sspa basin the towing carriage can move in the x and y directions with the speed of 0 3 5 m s the flap type wave maker is installed in the longitudinal and wide directions generating regular and irregular waves on the other side of the wave maker there is a beach that minimizes the reflection of incident waves as the sspa experiment was a self propulsion experiment a propeller and a rudder were installed in the self propulsion test added resistance can be obtained through two steps i measurement of the thrust in calm water t calm water ii measurement of the thrust in waves t wave at the same speed the added resistance r aw can be obtained by subtracting the thrust in calm water from the time averaged thrust with waves and multiplied by 1 t i e r aw t wave t calm water 1 t where t is the thrust reduction coefficient the thrust reduction coefficient can change in waves in this study however the thrust reduction coefficient in calm water is used owing to the assumption that the thrust reduction coefficient does not change much in the waves in this study the s vlcc tanker which was designed by samsung heavy industries was selected as the ship model the principal dimensions of the ship model are listed in table 3 in snu test a captive test was performed on a 1 100 scale model while a 1 68 scale model was used for the test at sspa basin obviously there is the scale effects for the two difference ships and such scale effects are under further study however in this study the direct comparison was made under the assumption that the scale effects are not significant fig 5 shows the two models which were used at snu towing tank and sspa basin the model of the snu towing tank had an extended vertical shape above deck line in order to study the change in the added resistance at high wave amplitude however the condition of this study are mild condition and there is no influence of deck extension on added resistance table 4 summarizes the experiment conditions the incident waves were at seven wave directions between 180 and 0 the snu experiment was done only in the head sea condition i e 180 there were ten wavelengths from 0 3 to 2 0 times the length of the ship two wave slope conditions were selected for the wavelength range of 0 3 0 9 the slope of the wave was set to 1 50 and for the wavelength range of 1 0 2 0 the slope of the wave was set to 1 100 the selection of the wave slope was determined from the ratio of the added resistance to the calm water resistance as fig 2 shows when the wave slope is low the added resistance is not easy to measure since the added resistance in short waves is very small compared with the calm water resistance instead when the wave slope is large the added resistance increases in the short waves however as the wavelength increases the added resistance sharply increases becoming twice as high as the calm water resistance in addition nonlinear characteristics such as green water generation at the bow and exposure of the bulbous bow above the free surface may occur for this reason experimental conditions were selected for the two wave slope conditions 5 motion responses the motion response of the ship was compared before comparing the added resistance in the oblique sea conditions six degrees of freedom motion occurs but in this study only three motion responses were analyzed the motions that have a great influence on the added resistance are heave roll and pitch motion responses as can be easily deduced from eq 10 the other three motion responses may influence the added resistance but the effect is not known to be significant when discussing the added resistance the effect of the three motions surge sway and yaw on the added resistance will be checked under one representative condition fig 6 shows the motion response in the head sea condition in the head sea condition there is no roll motion therefore only heave and pitch motion responses are compared in the experiments the phase of the motion response was not measured in this study only the magnitude of the motion response was compared the experimental results of sspa and snu were marked by symbols experiments at snu have been repeatedly performed under the same condition so several symbols are displayed under the same condition the experimental results are represented by different symbols according to the slope of the wave however this study used the linear method of numerical analysis and hence the numerical results are not changed by the slope of the wave the results of the rankine panel method are shown by a solid line and the strip method data are represented by a dotted line in these figures ω is the natural frequency of motion response the natural frequency of the motion response given by ω c m a where c is the restoring coefficient m and a are the mass and added mass respectively the natural frequency of the motion is one value but the wavelength at which the resonance occurs varies owing to the influence of the encounter frequency first experimental results of the heave motion response were compared in the region where the wavelength ratio is 1 3 or less the experimental results of snu and sspa agree well conversely the experimental results of sspa showed higher values than those of the numerical analysis in the region where the wavelength ratio is 1 3 or more pitch motion response showed the same tendency as the heave motion response in general the pitch motion response has a value of 1 when it is non dimensionalized by wave slope in the long wavelength region however the sspa test results showed a value greater than one at long wavelengths incident waves were not generated well in the long wavelength region due to the generation of the reflected waves from the side wall and the wall opposite to the wave maker the results of two numerical methods agree well with those of snu the peak of heave motion response occurred near the natural frequency for the pitch motion response the peak motion response occurred at a low frequency region than the natural frequency there are two reasons why the peak of motion response does not always occur near the natural frequency first the exciting force at the natural frequency could be small the peak of motion response could occur where the exciting force is large second the heave and pitch motions are strongly coupled the coupling term can shift the position of the resonance point fig 7 shows the experimental symbols rankine panel method solid lines and strip method dotted lines heave motion response data for the 150 0 incident wave directions the characteristics of the heave motion response according to the direction of the incident wave revealed the peak of the heave motion increased as the incident wave direction was changed from 150 to 90 the maximum value of the heave motion response occurred at a wavelength ratio of about 0 8 when the direction of the incident wave was 90 furthermore the peak of the heave motion response shifted to the short waves this is because the natural frequency of heave motion moved to the short waves in the quartering waves between 90 and 0 the natural frequency is located in the short waves the exciting force is very small in the short waves therefore no large motion response is observed the motion responses show similar shapes to those of the exciting forces the results of the two numerical analyses agree well with each other and the numerical analysis findings concurred with the experimental results fig 8 shows the roll motion responses the magnitude of roll motion response is highly affected by viscosity as the rankine panel method and the strip method which are numerical methods used in this study are based on potential theory the viscous roll damping cannot be considered therefore to account for the viscous force 3 the 3 is obtained through fitting with free roll decay test of the sspa experiment of the critical roll damping was considered as the viscous roll damping in the rankine panel method in time domain in the strip method viscous roll damping is considered by using the equivalent viscous damping coefficient in frequency domain the magnitude of the roll motion response is greatly affected by viscous roll damping in this study as the same coefficient was used for all incident wave directions some of the conditions corresponded well with the experimental results whereas others differed from the experimental results under the 150 condition the position of the resonance point agrees well with both the experimental and numerical results however at the resonance point the experimental results are smaller than the results of the strip method and show larger values than the rankine panel method as mentioned above the magnitude of the roll motion response is affected by viscous roll damping under the 120 condition the position of the resonance point is shifted to the short waves and its magnitude increased under the 90 and 30 conditions the roll motion response decreased sharply this tendency is similar to the tendency of the heave motion response the rankine panel method is a 3 d method and the strip method is a 2 d method the 2 d method has a limitation compared to a 3 d method also the viscous damping is the same in both methods but wave damping is different for this reason even with the same viscous damping the roll motion response may differ finally fig 9 shows the pitch motion responses the effective wave slope k a cos β is plotted as pink dashed lines on the fig 9 the pitch motion response in the long oblique waves approaches the effective wave slope lloyd 1989 the pitch motion response showed a tendency different from the heave and roll motion responses the pitch motion response decreased with a decrease in the incident wave angle from 150 to 90 the smallest magnitude of the motion response occurred under the 90 condition physically it is easy to guess that the pitch motion response decreases in the beam sea the pitch motion increased slightly at 60 at 30 and 0 the pitch motion responses were similar to each other the experimental and the rankine panel results agreed well with the overall conditions the strip method results showed some discrepancy near the natural frequency in this section the experimental results have been compared with the numerical results the characteristics of the motion response according to the direction of the incident wave were also examined the effect of this change in the motion response on the added resistance will be discussed in the following section 6 added resistance two experimental results snu and sspa and two numerical analysis results strip method and rankine panel method were compared in the head sea condition fig 10 shows the added resistance in the head sea condition the experimental results are presented for the rankine panel method solid line strip method corrected for a short waves dotted line and the short waves correction method snu formula one dot chain line different symbols are used according to the slope of wave as shown in section 2 there are many added resistance results in the head sea condition and the findings of this study showed a similar tendency to the general results the experiment results of sspa and snu were in good agreement in the region where the wavelength ratio is greater than 1 3 the heave and pitch motion responses of sspa showed larger values than those of snu as shown in fig 6 however the added resistance of sspa is only slightly bigger than that of snu the rankine panel method data were in good agreement with the experimental results the strip method showed larger values than the experimental results at wavelengths longer than the length of the ship the results of snu formula in the short waves showed similar values to the experimental results fig 11 shows the added resistance from 150 to 0 in the direction of the incident wave the experimental results and the results of the numerical results will be discussed from two perspectives first the trends in the results of added resistance experiments in oblique sea conditions will be investigated second the applicability of numerical methods and the short waves correction method in oblique sea conditions will be discussed when the direction of the incident wave is 150 the peak of the added resistance experiment increases and the position shifts to the short waves as compared with the 180 condition this tendency is consistent with that shown in fig 3 the rankine panel method data were in good agreement with the experimental data conversely although the strip method results were consistent with trends the added resistance was larger than the experimental results the snu formula results in the short waves showed small values than the experimental results experimental results at the 120 condition showed the same tendency as the added resistance of the other ships shown in fig 3 the position of the peak moved to the short waves and the added resistance decreased the rankine panel method results showed a similar tendency but higher added resistance than the experimental results in the region where the peak of the added resistance appeared the effect of surge sway and yaw motions on the added resistance was also investigated in the 120 condition to investigate the effect of the motion response on the added resistance the motion is restrained and the added resistance was calculated the results are shown in fig 11 b when each motion was restrained the added resistance did not change much this means that the three motion responses surge sway and yaw do not have a significant effect on the added resistance at fn 0 137 condition additional researches are needed to determine the effect of three motion responses on the added resistance for various speeds of various ship types the strip method results showed a large added resistance the value of snu formula results in the short waves were small than the value of experimental results the snu formula is a method of correcting the diffraction component among the components of the added resistance in the short waves in order to know the ratio of the diffraction component in the added resistance the added resistance component was analyzed fig 12 shows the components of added resistance using the rankine panel method the pure diffraction component is obtained in all motion constrained condition and the radiation related component is obtained by subtracting the pure diffraction component from the total added resistance therefore the radiation related component is the sum of the pure radiation component and the coupling term of the radiation and diffraction components the pure diffraction component of added resistance shows no significant change from 180 to 120 conditions for the 90 condition it shows a tendency to decrease gradually the radiation related component shows a tendency of the peak position to move to the short waves for the 60 condition it shows a small value without a distinct peak position in the head sea condition the snu formula method is useful because the pure diffraction component occupies most of the added resistance in the short waves as shown in fig 12 however as the direction of the incident wave moves from the head sea to the beam sea the component with the large motion response also moves to the short waves this trend can be seen in the motion responses shown in figs 8 10 therefore the radiation related component has a significant influence on the added resistance in the short waves as observed in fig 12 b owing to these effects the experimental data have a different tendency to the snu formula results in the short waves in the beam sea the peak of the added resistance is moved to the wavelength ratio 0 7 and the magnitude was reduced compared with fig 3 c the added resistance of other ships showed a similar trend the rankine panel method data agreed well with the experimental results the trend of the strip method agreed with the experimental trend but showed a difference in the short waves the snu formula presented different outcomes from the experimental results the snu formula seems to have a limitation in predicting the short waves added resistance when the incident wave direction is less than 90 for the 60 condition the added resistance is greatly reduced the results of rankine panel method agreed well with the experimental results whereas the results of the strip method showed differences in the short waves the snu formula showed a value close to zero at conditions of 60 0 experimental results of this study showed a tendency different from that of other ships in fig 3 e when the incident wave direction is 30 in fig 3 e the added resistance did not increase in the short waves which is opposite to findings in this study as shown in fig 11 e the added resistance by the rankine panel method did not increase in the short waves considering these facts there seems to be a problem in the experiment at the 30 condition additional research is needed to clarify this part the added resistance of the strip method showed a peak at a wavelength ratio of 0 8 this peak is related to the τ ωu g 0 25 condition in the frequency domain program strip the effect of τ was apparent but in the time domain rankine panel method the effect of τ was not apparent furthermore the effect of τ was not apparent in the experimental results in the following sea condition both the experiment and rankine panel method showed small added resistances the strip method showed a peak in the short waves due to the effect of τ 0 25 the polar diagrams in figs 13 15 are shown to understand the trend of the overall added resistance in the diagrams the θ direction indicates the direction of the incident wave and the r direction indicates the wavelength ratio fig 13 shows the added resistance obtained from the experiment large added resistance values were observed in the direction of the incident wave between 150 and 180 and the wavelength of the incident wave was similar to the length of the ship the added resistance tends to decrease gradually from 120 to 0 in the direction of the incident wave fig 14 shows the added resistance using the strip method the overall shape is similar but the magnitude is larger compared to the experimental results the effect of τ 0 25 is shown in the following sea conditions fig 15 shows the added resistance using the rankine panel method which is generally consistent with the experimental results 7 conclusions in order to understand the tendency of added resistance in oblique sea conditions experimental results published in the literature were observed and a thorough study was carried out for a ship model particularly both experimental and computational studies were carried out for a commercial large tanker the experiments were carried out by snu and sspa and two numerical approaches strip and rankine panel methods were applied for numerical computation based on the present study the following conclusions were made comparing the results of the added resistance experiments of various ships there is a consistent tendency on the direction of the incident wave between 180 and 120 at the head sea β 180 the peak of added resistance appears at a lightly larger wavelength than the length of the ship from 180 to 120 the peak of added resistance is shifted to the short waves region between 90 and 0 conditions added resistance becomes much small and scattered in the experimental results of a tanker at design speed the maximum added resistance was observed between the incident wave directions of 180 and 150 the added resistance between 120 and 90 conditions gradually decreased and between 60 and 0 conditions showed a small value without a clear trend in the oblique sea conditions of a tanker at design speed the computational results of the present rankine panel method data agreed well with the experimental results the strip method results showed a similar tendency to the experimental results but the added resistance was greater than the experimental results in the oblique sea conditions the peak frequency of the motion response moves and the radiation related component of added resistance can increases even in short waves in order to predict the added resistance of the short wave length region in the oblique sea it is important to predict the radiation related component as well as diffraction component acknowledgment this research was supported by the lrf funded research center at seoul national university south korea project number

22689,this study aims to investigate the coupled mechanism of the tunnel immersion system during freeboard elimination one of the most critical scenarios for submerged tunnel construction to address the coupling effect synchronous measurements have been conducted on the tunnel rig motions and the suspension tensions during freeboard elimination the motion characteristics of the tunnel at zero freeboard and immersion rigs are compared under regular and random waves the effects of the wave period wave height and wave obliquity on the dynamic responses of the system are examined the results indicate that the coupling effect between the tunnel and rig is not only subjected to the wave height but also the wave period in particular the most critical downward displacement of the tunnel and suspension tension were observed at the natural roll period of the coupled system t t roll in addition green water has a significant effect on the downward displacement of the tunnel and leads to severe relative heave and critical dynamic suspension tensions keywords tunnel immersion system coupled multi floater relative motion freeboard elimination suspension tension 1 introduction to relieve the traffics in coastal cities the immersed tunnel solution has been applied successfully because of the advantages of free clearance limitation for navigation and the shallower and shorter buried route comparing to the shield tunnel ingerslev and fasce 2012 during the construction the immersion of the tunnel element is the most critical and risky process the coupled immersion system consists of moored tunnel element and immersion rigs connected by the suspension lines under weather conditions for deployment the element is suspended from the immersion rigs and the immersion takes place after sufficient ballasting provided grantz 2001 nowadays with the development of the longer and larger tunnel element in open seas the immersed tunnel construction confronts more complex engineering conditions and higher technical standards zhang et al 2016 in particular for offshore sites with stormy weathers the severe wave conditions can lead to excessive motions of the tunnel element and unexpected consequences to avoid uncertain risks and ensure a safe and efficient installation the hydrodynamic responses of the tunnel immersion system is worth to address considering a wide range of energetic sea states up to date there is few literature related to the dynamic behaviors of a coupled tunnel immersion system exposed to offshore conditions chakrabarti et al 2008 and cozijn and heo 2009 carried out both model tests and time domain simulation to investigate the motions of the tunnel and the cable tension on the mooring lines and suspension lines at different immersion depths however few data have been presented to demonstrate the conclusion that tunnel immersion system is more vulnerable to longer period waves chen et al 2009 adopted the potential theory to study the motions of the tunnel element with a fixed barge during immersion ignoring the motions of the floating immersion rigs nagel 2011 conducted a 2d frequency domain analysis on the dynamic behaviors of the tunnel element immersed 1 m below the free surface it was found that high forces of the hoisting cables occurred during motion resonance chen et al 2012 obtained the tensions on the mooring cables and hoist cables of the immersed tunnel under specified offshore conditions using model tests in 2d model tests zuo and wang 2015 and yang et al 2017 measured the motion of the tunnel element suspended by a moored barge under different immersion depths varying from 10m to 20m under irregular waves wu et al 2016 investigated the nonlinear wave forces on large scale submerged tunnel element numerically assuming that the tunnel element and the two immersion rigs were rigid connected as a single floater song et al 2014 2015 and huang et al 2016 performed experimental investigations on the dynamic responses of the suspension lines and the motions of tunnel element under irregular waves during immersion stage in particular critical dynamic tensions and frequent slacks in suspension lines were observed during freeboard elimination stage and hence it was identified as a critical scenario for immersion during freeboard elimination the tunnel element is started releasing from the rigs but the motion behaviors are totally different to the rigs hence the interaction between the tunnel element and rigs could be significant under waves as a consequence the suspension lines will experience excessive loads and even sudden snap loads and slags which lead to high risk on the failure of the suspension lines to predict the dynamic response of the immersion system accurately it is therefore necessary to understand the coupling mechanism of the system unfortunately this has yet been figured out thus far the tunnel immersion system can be regarded as a flexibly connected multi floater system there were some coupling researches on other multi floater system i e side by side connected vessels multi module floating structures offloading cargos suspended by floating cranes float over installed platform etc koo and kim 2005 conducted hydrodynamic and mooring analyses in time domain for two side by side connected floating platforms during offloading operation considering the effects of multi body interactions and their relative motions peña et al 2011 performed experimental investigations to analyze the mooring lines and module connector forces of a floating multi body breakwater tajali and shafieefar 2011 carried out numerical simulations to analyze the hydrodynamic response of a multi module floating pier for a wide range of wave frequency and heading angle cha et al 2010 developed the multi body dynamic analysis of heavy cargo suspended by a floating crane geba et al 2017 introduced a new method of topside deck installations floaters float over and discussed the stability motions and strengthen performance of the system in its installation stage another important issue to consider is that strongly nonlinear hydrodynamic interaction would occur in the zero freeboard tunnel and immersion rigs such as the resonance of trapped waters and green water it is challenging to conduct an accurate 3d numerical simulation to solve the problem in present study 3d model tests have been carried out to investigate the coupling mechanism of the tunnel immersion system during the freeboard elimination stage the motion characteristics of the zero freeboard element and immersion rigs are compared under regular and irregular waves the effects of wave height wave period and wave incident angle are examined and the coupling of the system is addressed based on fft analysis of the measurements discussions are also highlighted on the key effect of the roll frequency on the motion and dynamic responses of the tunnel immersion system in the following we shall first describe the experimental setup and parameters secondly the results will be discussed on the tunnel motion the rig motion the relative motion and the suspension tensions under regular and irregular waves the effect of wave period wave height and wave direction are highlighted in the end the conclusions are drawn based on the discussion 2 experimental setup 2 1 tunnel immersion system model and test facility the experiments were conducted in the 3d basin of the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering slcoe dalian university of technology china the basin is 40m long 24m wide and 1 2m deep a piston type wave maker is installed at one end of the basin to generate designed waves ranging from simple small amplitude monochromatic waves to large amplitude random waves in multi directions at the other end of the basin a dissipative gravel beach equipped with slightly consolidated highly porous metallic strips is installed to absorb waves and minimize reflections effectively to achieve unidirectional incident waves two parallel rows of wave absorbers are also arranged on two sides of the basin along the direction of wave propagation to prevent lateral reflection model tests for wave effects on offshore structures require that froude number equivalence be obtained since the gravitational acceleration plays a key role in wave action thus in this study the froude similarity expressed by the equation u m g m l m u p g p l p is achieved the subscript m and p represent for the model and prototype respectively refer to the tunnel immersion system applied in hongkong zhuhai macau link project the models of tunnel element and immersion rigs were designed with the scale of l p l m 60 the tunnel element model was manufactured from acrylic and concrete and the immersion rigs were made of light wood in consistency with the prototype to simulate the mechanical characteristics accurately the center of gravity cog and moments of inertias matched to the prototype ones with errors less than 2 the main geometrical and mechanical parameters of tunnel element and catamaran immersion rig are presented in table 1 the sketch of the manufactured model of tunnel element and pontoon are shown in fig 1 the tunnel rigs system was installed in design location of the wave basin and moored on the bottom by sixteen wires the plan and elevation views are illustrated in fig 2 for each floater four mooring lines were placed symmetrically along the x axis and arranged with an inclined 60 angle against the x axis in the horizontal x y plane in addition each rig was connected to the tunnel element by two suspension lines note that when the freeboard is eliminated the buoyancy of tunnel element equals to its gravity leading to zero initial tensions on the suspension lines the pre tensions of mooring lines were set as 1 0n corresponding to 21 6t in prototype in experiments non elastic ropes combined with clump weights were utilized for the suspension and mooring lines to match the froude similarity most importantly to meet the similarity of elastic property the nonlinear stiffness of the mooring lines was calibrated using several segmented linear springs and the suspension lines were simulated with linear elastic of 2 78 kn m corresponding to 104 kn m in prototype the mechanical parameters of the mooring lines on the tunnel and rig and the connecting lines are tabulated in table 2 fig 3 gives the theoretical and simulated tension deformation curves of the mooring lines and it can be observed that excellent agreement was achieved to address the relationship between the relative motion and suspension tensions the movements of the floating structures and the mooring suspension tensions were measured simultaneously in each test the arrangement of the measuring system on the tunnel immersion system is illustrated in fig 4 sixteen tensile gauges were arranged separately to measure the tensions on the mooring lines and suspension lines an electromagnetic system was applied to capture the six degree of freedom motions of both the tunnel and an immersion rig synchronously as shown in fig 4 two receiving sensors were firmly attached on the center of the topside of the tunnel and immersion rig separately while the transmitter was installed 1m above the system to achieve a non contact real time tracking of the floaters the measured data were analyzed to obtain the 6 dofs of the floating bodies in a 3d rectangular coordinate as shown in fig 5 the accuracy was better than 1 mm for translations and 0 1 deg for rotations the sample frequency of the electromagnetic motion system and the tensile gauges was 50hz in the experiments after the tests the measured data were converted to prototype values based on the froude similarity 2 2 experimental conditions in present study the scales for wave height and wave period are 1 60 and 1 7 74 respectively the prototype water depth is fixed at 36m for the cases of regular waves the prototype wave period t is varied from 4s to 20s with fixed wave height h 2 0m and incident angle β 90 75 with t 8s and β 90 the prototype wave height ranges from 0 5m to 3m for irregular waves the improved jonswap spectrum was selected with the peak enhancement factor γ 3 3 goda 2010 the peak period was in a range of 6s 20s in prototype with fixed significant wave height h s 1 5m and incident angle β 90 the wave parameters simulated for the regular and irregular waves are summarized in table 3 and table 4 respectively refer to the recommended practice proposed by 17th international towing tank conference in 1984 the duration of approximately 100 times the longest single wave period in the irregular waves is suggested to obtain proper spectral shapes and statistical values fig 6 provides the comparison between the measured and targeted spectra under wave conditions of h s 1 5m t p 6s 10s which matches well with each other 3 results and discussion 3 1 eigen value analysis to evaluate the eigen properties of the coupled tunnel immersion system ansys aqwa was applied to perform the modal analysis of the system considering frequency dependent added mass and damping based on potential theory aqwa employs 3d green s function to simulate linearized hydrodynamic loads on floating rigid bodies with radiation and diffraction considered the validation of the software in solving the interactions among multiple floating bodies has been proven in past studies geba et al 2017 jin et al 2019 the fully coupled immersion system includes 18 modes of rigid body motion and the 18 natural frequencies eigenvectors are summarized in table 5 all mode shapes are presented as a combination of different degrees of freedom the dominant coupled dofs in each eigen vector are marked in bold 3 2 responses of the tunnel immersion system under regular wave 3 2 1 coupled motion characteristics of the tunnel and immersion rig the time series of the motions of the tunnel element and the immersion rigs under beam regular wave are reported in fig 7 the regular wave of h 2 0m t 10s was selected to illustrate the typical characteristics excited with the roll resonance the result indicates that the equilibrium position of the sway drifts along with the wave propagation direction due to the mean drift force in addition it can be observed clearly that the mean position of the tunnel s heave drifts downward significantly from the stationary position as pointed out by sueyoshi et al 2008 it is attributed to the occurrence of green water consequently the immersion rig is also affected by the tunnel via the suspension lines and shows similar features in heave moreover the rolls of the tunnel and immersion rig behave similar in both phase and amplitude fig 7 implies that the surge pitch and yaw of the tunnel is insignificant however the surge pitch and yaw of the immersion rig have a significant amplitude it is evident that surge and yaw of the rig is dominated by a dual wave periodic response of 20s while the rig s pitch is combined by a natural periodic response of 7s and a subharmonic response of 20s these subharmonic fluctuations can be generated from the strongly nonlinear hydrodynamic interaction among the tunnel and immersion rigs at resonance period of roll luckily perhaps to build up subharmonic motions of high amplitude the excitation needs to maintain very nicely behaved over quite some time journée et al 2015 thus when exposed to irregular seas this subharmonic motion would break down before large amplitude are generated as demonstrated in fig 16 3 2 2 effect of the wave period the variation of the motions of the tunnel immersion system is plotted versus the wave period with h 2 0m and β 90 in fig 8 in order to highlight the effect of the roll resonance the wave period is normalized by the roll period t roll 9s and the relative wave period t t roll ranges from 0 44 to 2 22 the 6 dof displacements are normalized by the wave amplitude a 1 0m the label te is short for tunnel element and ir is for immersion rig fig 8 shows that the sway of the tunnel and immersion rig has an increasing trend with the wave period meanwhile the heave of the tunnel and immersion rig both increase with the wave period and then tends to follow the water surface getting the local peaks at t t roll 1 33 interestingly asymmetric maxima and minima of the heave is observed in the tunnel due to the gravity effects of on deck water and lack of restoring force fig 8 also indicates that as the wave period increases the rolls of the tunnel and immersion rig experience an increase and then a decrease getting their peaks at t t roll 0 89 1 11 moreover the pitch resonance of the immersion rig occurs evidently at t t roll 0 78 but has no effect on the tunnel since it doesn t affect the connection point of the suspension lines additionally it should be noted that peak values of the surge pitch and yaw of the immersion rig occur at t t roll 1 11 1 22 this is because the amplified roll of the system could provoke the resonance of the trapped water among the floaters and lead to an asymmetric pressure distribution surrounding the immersion rigs to address the effect of green water quantitively the mean values of the heave of the tunnel and immersion rig are plotted against the relative wave period in fig 9 it shows that the mean heave values of the tunnel and immersion rig have a similar dependence on the relative wave period to the roll the mean heave value has its peak at t t roll 0 89 1 00 when the incident wave period is close to the roll period of the coupled system this is readily comprehensible that larger rolling oscillation leads to more drastic wave body interaction provoking larger amount of on deck water and stronger green water effect zhao et al 2014 moreover the mean heave of tunnel is the most significant at t t roll 0 78 1 33 when the roll amplitude of the tunnel is more than 2 deg and also leads to a large amplitude difference to that of the rig the relative motion rm the tunnel motion minus the synchronous immersion rig motion is presented in fig 10 it can be observed that the relative sway increases with the wave period for t t roll 0 56 1 00 gets a local peak at t t roll 1 00 and then decreases this can be attributed by the coupling effect of the resonance roll the relative motions in surge pitch and yaw directions are similar to those of the immersion rig due to the insignificant displacements of the tunnel most importantly the relative heave has relatively large amplitude in short waves of t t roll 1 11 and then decreases gradually with the wave period for longer waves getting its peak value at roll period of t t roll 1 11 this is linked to the significant mean heave value gap between tunnel and immersion rig when the roll resonance is excited as indicated by fig 9 moreover the relative roll has a significant decreasing trend with the wave period of t t roll 0 44 1 56 and keeps quasi steady with longer waves to investigate the tension distribution of the four suspension lines the standard deviation std and average values avg are discussed in this study the avg and std values are obtained respectively by 1 f a v g 1 4 i 1 4 f i 2 f s t d 1 4 i 1 4 f i f a v g 2 where f i represented the single suspension tension in the four suspension lines the maximum value of single tension std tension and avg tension normalized by the gravity of tunnel g are plotted with t t roll in fig 11 the results clearly show that for waves of t t roll 1 11 all the four suspension lines suffer high extreme tensions and the tension on seaward lines is significantly larger than leeward lines meanwhile the avg and std tensions also have significant values caused by the relative heave and relative roll respectively as revealed in fig 10 however under longer waves of t t roll 1 11 the maximum single suspension tension undergoes an evident decrease along with decreased avg and std tensions among the four suspension lines this is closely related to the reduced relative heave and relative roll and demonstrates an approximately even tension distribution and a relatively stable tunnel element specifically it can also be observed that both the maximum single tensions and avg tensions reach their local peaks at t t roll 1 11 when the wave period closes to the roll period it verifies that the resonance roll has a key effect on the dynamic responses of the suspension lines 3 2 3 effect of the wave height fig 12 shows variation of the six motion components of the tunnel immersion rig and their relative motion with h the wave height ranges from 0 5m to 3 0m with t 8s and β 90 a significant increase can be observed in the sway of the tunnel and immersion rig as the wave height grows albeit with small amplitude difference larger relative sway is reported for steeper waves due to the significant phase difference of the tunnel and immersion rig the surge of the tunnel and immersion rig together with the relative surge has a slowly increasing trend with wave height with respect to the heave of the tunnel and immersion rig the downward amplitude positive experiences an evident increase with the wave height while the upward amplitude negative has few changes also the effect of the wave height on the mean value of the heave is presented in fig 13 it indicates that the mean heave values are enlarged with an intensified tendency for higher waves specifically the mean heave value of the tunnel grows twice as that of the immersion rig leading to a significantly growing relative heave in steeper waves this can be related to the stronger influence of the green water in steeper waves which is induced by wave elevation larger exceedance over the tunnel top and more severe fluid structure interaction additionally the roll amplitudes of the tunnel immersion rig and relative motion have a significant growth under steeper waves in the pitch and yaw directions the tunnel motion increases slowly in steeper waves while the immersion rig motion exhibits a significant growth leading to a larger relative motion amplitude fig 14 a and b illustrates the effect of wave height on the maximum values of the single tension and the avg std values respectively the results indicate that as the incident wave height grows the maximum tension of all the four suspension lines experience an evident increase this is mainly contributed by the growth in the avg tension which is induced by the enlarged relative heave as indicated in fig 12 moreover steeper wave leads to greater std tension due to larger relative roll thus it can be concluded that steeper waves would intensify the instability of the tunnel immersion system and thus seriously unbalance the tension distribution among the four suspension lines 3 2 4 effect of the incident angle fig 15 illustrates the comparison of tunnel rig motion and their relative motion under incident angles of β 90 and β 75 parameters of regular waves t t roll 0 56 1 56 and a 1 0m were applied it shows that the sway of the tunnel under β 75 is smaller than that under β 90 in the test scope the wave incident angle has minor effect on the sway of the immersion rig and the relative sway the surge of the tunnel pontoon and the relative surge under β 75 is slightly larger than that under β 90 with t t roll 1 11 1 56 noteworthy compared to β 90 the downward displacement of the tunnel is significantly decreased under β 75 for t t roll 0 56 0 78 but its upward displacement exhibits a slight increase this is because the oblique waves of β 75 weakens the influence of the on deck water and leads to a smaller downward offset for the tunnel moreover the relative heave decreases a bit in downward direction but has larger value in upward direction for β 75 the rolls of the tunnel and immersion rig have smaller amplitudes for β 75 and the decrease is most evident for t t roll 0 78 1 33 moreover the relative roll is larger with β 75 than that of β 90 for t t roll 0 56 0 89 but is affected little by β for longer waves this is probably due to the enlarged phase lag of the tunnel and immersion rig motions in oblique waves the pitch and yaw amplitudes of the tunnel for β 75 are slightly larger than that of β 90 however for the pitch and yaw of the immersion rig great local peaks are exhibited at t t roll 0 78 for β 75 leading to significant relative motions in this direction this should be considered carefully since it could arise high risks of collision between tunnel and immersion rigs in close proximity and jeopardize the structural safety and operation security fig 16 a b compare the maximum values of the line tension 1 3 the avg tension and std tension for β 90 and β 75 with a 1 0m and t t roll 0 56 1 56 as shown in fig 16 a basically the maximum single suspension tension under oblique waves of β 75 is smaller than that under beam wave of β 90 for the seaward line of rig 1 however the most critical single tension is observed under β 75 rather than β 90 for t t roll 0 56 0 89 which leads to a more uneven tension distribution among the four lines consequently with t t roll 0 56 0 89 the avg value of the suspension tensions becomes smaller for β 75 and the std value of the suspension tensions greater than that of β 90 however for longer wave conditions the std value of the suspension tensions is limited affected by the wave obliquity this can be closely associated with the larger relative roll for β 75 especially when the shielding effect is important in short waves of t t roll 0 56 0 89 refer to the most critical single suspension tension observed it is recommended to investigate the dynamic response of coupled multi floater under oblique wave as well as the beam wave to ensure the worst case scenario being captured 3 3 responses of the tunnel immersion system in irregular waves 3 3 1 motion characteristics of the tunnel and immersion rig fig 17 shows motion time history of the tunnel element coupled with immersion rig under typical sea state of h s 1 5m t p 9s β 90 it indicates that the predominant motions the sway heave and roll of the immersion rig and tunnel behave similar to each other a slow swaying motion of the tunnel and immersion rig is observed as well as the oscillations in wave frequency while the heave and roll are governed by the wave frequency response in addition the tunnel experiences larger amplitude in sway and heave than those of the immersion rig it implies that the zero freeboard tunnel is very sensitive to wave excitation moreover the tunnel and pontoon show different motion characteristics for the surge pitch and yaw which will be discussed further in the spectral analysis below to further explore the motion characteristics and dynamic properties of the tunnel immersion system spectral analysis was performed by fft for the tunnel immersion rig their relative motion and the suspension tensions based on the time domain measurements the spectra of 6 dofs of the tunnel element immersion rig and their synchronous relative motion were compared in fig 18 a f with h s 1 5m t p 6 20s t p t roll 0 67 2 22 and β 90 from fig 18 a it can be clearly seen that the sway of tunnel element is dominant by the resonant response at low frequency of t p t roll 0 67 1 22 induced by the significant slowly varying drift force while for t p t roll 1 55 2 22 the wave frequency sway becomes important as well for the immersion rig sway is dominated by wave frequency component for t p t roll 0 67 2 22 therefore the relative sway is dominated by combined low frequency and wave frequency components for t p t roll 0 67 1 22 and by low frequency component for t p t roll 1 55 2 22 as illustrated in fig 18 b the surge of tunnel element is dominated by low frequency of f 0 008hz subjecting to the mooring configuration the surge of the immersion rig has three peaks at f 0 04hz 0 11hz and 0 15hz in according to the surge roll and pitch resonance frequency of the two immersion rigs for t p t roll 0 67 1 22 for longer waves the surge of the immersion rig concentrates its energy in f 0 04hz consequently the relative surge reveals similar spectral features with the rig s surge fig 18 c shows that the heave of the tunnel and immersion rig are consistent in shape and dominated by the wave frequency except for the jonswap spectral peak frequency the relative heave spectra also exhibit peaks in low frequency f 0 022hz and high frequency f 0 25hz which can be corresponding to the in phase heave and anti phase heave of the tunnel and immersion rigs respectively in fig 18 d the roll of the tunnel and immersion rig is dominated by the wave frequency motion for short waves of t p t roll 0 67 1 11 while for longer waves the roll is also affected by the in phase roll resonance frequency of f 0 11hz this is due to the largest rao value of the natural frequency in fig 7 thus the wave component close to the roll frequency contained in the incident wave spectra should be considered carefully since small energy could lead to a significant response correspondingly the relative roll exhibits its peak at wave peak frequency and roll frequency under t p t roll 0 67 1 11 and t p t roll 1 22 2 22 respectively fig 18 e reveals that the pitch of the tunnel is controlled by the wave frequency response whereas the pitch of the immersion rig is governed by its natural frequency of f 0 15hz as well as affected by the roll resonance for waves of t p t roll 0 78 2 22 correspondingly the relative pitch is distinctly focused in f 0 15hz and also presents a small peak in f 0 11hz in long waves which reinforces the coupling effect of the resonance roll as shown in fig 18 f the yaw of the tunnel and the immersion rig are both dominated by their natural frequencies which subject to the characteristics of the mooring system in combination with the hydrodynamic interaction among the floaters the low frequency yaw of the tunnel lies in 0 015 hz corresponding to the natural frequency of the tunnel s yaw in contrast the immersion rig s yaw is dominant in f 0 025hz close to the mode frequency of the anti phase yaw of the two immersion rigs and also affected by the roll resonance response of f 0 11hz the relative yaw behaves similar to the yaw of the immersion rig 3 3 2 characteristic of the suspension tension the tensions of the four suspension wires under irregular waves of h s 1 5m t p 9s is included in fig 19 to observe the snap load and slack clearly a typical duration of 200s is zoomed in and presented from the completed time history of 1200s 1 and 3 are seaward suspension wires and 2 and 4 are leeward wires it is revealed that the seaward suspension tension is larger than the leeward tension due to the significant relative roll in addition frequent slack and snap load are observed in the suspension tensions note that the slack and snap load occurs in the whole test scope and is most significant at the roll resonance period this is due to the dynamic tension induced by the relative motions between the tunnel and immersion rigs and the zero pre tension in suspension lines during freeboard elimination this can jeopardize the suspension system and is strictly not allowed during the immersion the spectra analysis of the seaward and leeward suspension tensions under irregular waves of various peak waves periods are displayed in fig 20 it should be pointed out that the spectra of the suspension tension exhibit multi peak characteristics except for the wave peak frequency the other three peaks are f 0 02hz 0 11hz and 0 25hz which is close to the natural frequency of the in phase heave the in phase roll and the anti phase heave of the tunnel and immersion rigs respectively among these peaks the wave spectral frequency shows the maximum peak value at t p t roll 1 00 whereas t p t roll 1 00 another significant peak value occurs at the roll natural frequency of f 0 11hz and even becomes dominant in the leeward tensions thus the wave component corresponding to the roll frequency in the jonswap spectra plays an essential role in the dynamic responses of the suspension lines especially for longer waves of t p t roll 1 00 and should be considered carefully 4 conclusion to investigate the coupling mechanism of the tunnel and immersion rig system the relative motion between the tunnel and rigs and the suspension tensions are measured simultaneously extensive data analysis has been performed and the following conclusions have been drawn 1 from eigen value analysis of the tunnel immersion system there are 18 modes coupled by different degrees of freedom the in phase roll of the tunnel and immersion rigs plays a key role in the dynamic responses of the system 2 during freeboard elimination green water has a significant effect on the downward displacement of the tunnel and leads to severe relative heave and critical dynamic suspension tensions the relative heave and maximum suspension tensions reach peaks close to the roll resonance period which is considered as the most critical scenario 3 for t t roll all of the four suspension lines experience high level dynamic loadings with the seaward tensions larger than leeward ones which can be attributed to the significant relative heave combined with the relative roll for t t roll however the tension distribution among four lines becomes more even due to the decreasing relative roll 4 comparing to beam wave the oblique wave of β 75 leads to larger maximum tension on single suspension line and produces a worse uneven distribution among the four suspension tensions for t t roll 0 56 0 89 to ensure the worst case scenario being captured it is recommended to consider the oblique wave on dynamic responses of the coupled floaters system as well as the beam wave acknowledgements the

22689,this study aims to investigate the coupled mechanism of the tunnel immersion system during freeboard elimination one of the most critical scenarios for submerged tunnel construction to address the coupling effect synchronous measurements have been conducted on the tunnel rig motions and the suspension tensions during freeboard elimination the motion characteristics of the tunnel at zero freeboard and immersion rigs are compared under regular and random waves the effects of the wave period wave height and wave obliquity on the dynamic responses of the system are examined the results indicate that the coupling effect between the tunnel and rig is not only subjected to the wave height but also the wave period in particular the most critical downward displacement of the tunnel and suspension tension were observed at the natural roll period of the coupled system t t roll in addition green water has a significant effect on the downward displacement of the tunnel and leads to severe relative heave and critical dynamic suspension tensions keywords tunnel immersion system coupled multi floater relative motion freeboard elimination suspension tension 1 introduction to relieve the traffics in coastal cities the immersed tunnel solution has been applied successfully because of the advantages of free clearance limitation for navigation and the shallower and shorter buried route comparing to the shield tunnel ingerslev and fasce 2012 during the construction the immersion of the tunnel element is the most critical and risky process the coupled immersion system consists of moored tunnel element and immersion rigs connected by the suspension lines under weather conditions for deployment the element is suspended from the immersion rigs and the immersion takes place after sufficient ballasting provided grantz 2001 nowadays with the development of the longer and larger tunnel element in open seas the immersed tunnel construction confronts more complex engineering conditions and higher technical standards zhang et al 2016 in particular for offshore sites with stormy weathers the severe wave conditions can lead to excessive motions of the tunnel element and unexpected consequences to avoid uncertain risks and ensure a safe and efficient installation the hydrodynamic responses of the tunnel immersion system is worth to address considering a wide range of energetic sea states up to date there is few literature related to the dynamic behaviors of a coupled tunnel immersion system exposed to offshore conditions chakrabarti et al 2008 and cozijn and heo 2009 carried out both model tests and time domain simulation to investigate the motions of the tunnel and the cable tension on the mooring lines and suspension lines at different immersion depths however few data have been presented to demonstrate the conclusion that tunnel immersion system is more vulnerable to longer period waves chen et al 2009 adopted the potential theory to study the motions of the tunnel element with a fixed barge during immersion ignoring the motions of the floating immersion rigs nagel 2011 conducted a 2d frequency domain analysis on the dynamic behaviors of the tunnel element immersed 1 m below the free surface it was found that high forces of the hoisting cables occurred during motion resonance chen et al 2012 obtained the tensions on the mooring cables and hoist cables of the immersed tunnel under specified offshore conditions using model tests in 2d model tests zuo and wang 2015 and yang et al 2017 measured the motion of the tunnel element suspended by a moored barge under different immersion depths varying from 10m to 20m under irregular waves wu et al 2016 investigated the nonlinear wave forces on large scale submerged tunnel element numerically assuming that the tunnel element and the two immersion rigs were rigid connected as a single floater song et al 2014 2015 and huang et al 2016 performed experimental investigations on the dynamic responses of the suspension lines and the motions of tunnel element under irregular waves during immersion stage in particular critical dynamic tensions and frequent slacks in suspension lines were observed during freeboard elimination stage and hence it was identified as a critical scenario for immersion during freeboard elimination the tunnel element is started releasing from the rigs but the motion behaviors are totally different to the rigs hence the interaction between the tunnel element and rigs could be significant under waves as a consequence the suspension lines will experience excessive loads and even sudden snap loads and slags which lead to high risk on the failure of the suspension lines to predict the dynamic response of the immersion system accurately it is therefore necessary to understand the coupling mechanism of the system unfortunately this has yet been figured out thus far the tunnel immersion system can be regarded as a flexibly connected multi floater system there were some coupling researches on other multi floater system i e side by side connected vessels multi module floating structures offloading cargos suspended by floating cranes float over installed platform etc koo and kim 2005 conducted hydrodynamic and mooring analyses in time domain for two side by side connected floating platforms during offloading operation considering the effects of multi body interactions and their relative motions peña et al 2011 performed experimental investigations to analyze the mooring lines and module connector forces of a floating multi body breakwater tajali and shafieefar 2011 carried out numerical simulations to analyze the hydrodynamic response of a multi module floating pier for a wide range of wave frequency and heading angle cha et al 2010 developed the multi body dynamic analysis of heavy cargo suspended by a floating crane geba et al 2017 introduced a new method of topside deck installations floaters float over and discussed the stability motions and strengthen performance of the system in its installation stage another important issue to consider is that strongly nonlinear hydrodynamic interaction would occur in the zero freeboard tunnel and immersion rigs such as the resonance of trapped waters and green water it is challenging to conduct an accurate 3d numerical simulation to solve the problem in present study 3d model tests have been carried out to investigate the coupling mechanism of the tunnel immersion system during the freeboard elimination stage the motion characteristics of the zero freeboard element and immersion rigs are compared under regular and irregular waves the effects of wave height wave period and wave incident angle are examined and the coupling of the system is addressed based on fft analysis of the measurements discussions are also highlighted on the key effect of the roll frequency on the motion and dynamic responses of the tunnel immersion system in the following we shall first describe the experimental setup and parameters secondly the results will be discussed on the tunnel motion the rig motion the relative motion and the suspension tensions under regular and irregular waves the effect of wave period wave height and wave direction are highlighted in the end the conclusions are drawn based on the discussion 2 experimental setup 2 1 tunnel immersion system model and test facility the experiments were conducted in the 3d basin of the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering slcoe dalian university of technology china the basin is 40m long 24m wide and 1 2m deep a piston type wave maker is installed at one end of the basin to generate designed waves ranging from simple small amplitude monochromatic waves to large amplitude random waves in multi directions at the other end of the basin a dissipative gravel beach equipped with slightly consolidated highly porous metallic strips is installed to absorb waves and minimize reflections effectively to achieve unidirectional incident waves two parallel rows of wave absorbers are also arranged on two sides of the basin along the direction of wave propagation to prevent lateral reflection model tests for wave effects on offshore structures require that froude number equivalence be obtained since the gravitational acceleration plays a key role in wave action thus in this study the froude similarity expressed by the equation u m g m l m u p g p l p is achieved the subscript m and p represent for the model and prototype respectively refer to the tunnel immersion system applied in hongkong zhuhai macau link project the models of tunnel element and immersion rigs were designed with the scale of l p l m 60 the tunnel element model was manufactured from acrylic and concrete and the immersion rigs were made of light wood in consistency with the prototype to simulate the mechanical characteristics accurately the center of gravity cog and moments of inertias matched to the prototype ones with errors less than 2 the main geometrical and mechanical parameters of tunnel element and catamaran immersion rig are presented in table 1 the sketch of the manufactured model of tunnel element and pontoon are shown in fig 1 the tunnel rigs system was installed in design location of the wave basin and moored on the bottom by sixteen wires the plan and elevation views are illustrated in fig 2 for each floater four mooring lines were placed symmetrically along the x axis and arranged with an inclined 60 angle against the x axis in the horizontal x y plane in addition each rig was connected to the tunnel element by two suspension lines note that when the freeboard is eliminated the buoyancy of tunnel element equals to its gravity leading to zero initial tensions on the suspension lines the pre tensions of mooring lines were set as 1 0n corresponding to 21 6t in prototype in experiments non elastic ropes combined with clump weights were utilized for the suspension and mooring lines to match the froude similarity most importantly to meet the similarity of elastic property the nonlinear stiffness of the mooring lines was calibrated using several segmented linear springs and the suspension lines were simulated with linear elastic of 2 78 kn m corresponding to 104 kn m in prototype the mechanical parameters of the mooring lines on the tunnel and rig and the connecting lines are tabulated in table 2 fig 3 gives the theoretical and simulated tension deformation curves of the mooring lines and it can be observed that excellent agreement was achieved to address the relationship between the relative motion and suspension tensions the movements of the floating structures and the mooring suspension tensions were measured simultaneously in each test the arrangement of the measuring system on the tunnel immersion system is illustrated in fig 4 sixteen tensile gauges were arranged separately to measure the tensions on the mooring lines and suspension lines an electromagnetic system was applied to capture the six degree of freedom motions of both the tunnel and an immersion rig synchronously as shown in fig 4 two receiving sensors were firmly attached on the center of the topside of the tunnel and immersion rig separately while the transmitter was installed 1m above the system to achieve a non contact real time tracking of the floaters the measured data were analyzed to obtain the 6 dofs of the floating bodies in a 3d rectangular coordinate as shown in fig 5 the accuracy was better than 1 mm for translations and 0 1 deg for rotations the sample frequency of the electromagnetic motion system and the tensile gauges was 50hz in the experiments after the tests the measured data were converted to prototype values based on the froude similarity 2 2 experimental conditions in present study the scales for wave height and wave period are 1 60 and 1 7 74 respectively the prototype water depth is fixed at 36m for the cases of regular waves the prototype wave period t is varied from 4s to 20s with fixed wave height h 2 0m and incident angle β 90 75 with t 8s and β 90 the prototype wave height ranges from 0 5m to 3m for irregular waves the improved jonswap spectrum was selected with the peak enhancement factor γ 3 3 goda 2010 the peak period was in a range of 6s 20s in prototype with fixed significant wave height h s 1 5m and incident angle β 90 the wave parameters simulated for the regular and irregular waves are summarized in table 3 and table 4 respectively refer to the recommended practice proposed by 17th international towing tank conference in 1984 the duration of approximately 100 times the longest single wave period in the irregular waves is suggested to obtain proper spectral shapes and statistical values fig 6 provides the comparison between the measured and targeted spectra under wave conditions of h s 1 5m t p 6s 10s which matches well with each other 3 results and discussion 3 1 eigen value analysis to evaluate the eigen properties of the coupled tunnel immersion system ansys aqwa was applied to perform the modal analysis of the system considering frequency dependent added mass and damping based on potential theory aqwa employs 3d green s function to simulate linearized hydrodynamic loads on floating rigid bodies with radiation and diffraction considered the validation of the software in solving the interactions among multiple floating bodies has been proven in past studies geba et al 2017 jin et al 2019 the fully coupled immersion system includes 18 modes of rigid body motion and the 18 natural frequencies eigenvectors are summarized in table 5 all mode shapes are presented as a combination of different degrees of freedom the dominant coupled dofs in each eigen vector are marked in bold 3 2 responses of the tunnel immersion system under regular wave 3 2 1 coupled motion characteristics of the tunnel and immersion rig the time series of the motions of the tunnel element and the immersion rigs under beam regular wave are reported in fig 7 the regular wave of h 2 0m t 10s was selected to illustrate the typical characteristics excited with the roll resonance the result indicates that the equilibrium position of the sway drifts along with the wave propagation direction due to the mean drift force in addition it can be observed clearly that the mean position of the tunnel s heave drifts downward significantly from the stationary position as pointed out by sueyoshi et al 2008 it is attributed to the occurrence of green water consequently the immersion rig is also affected by the tunnel via the suspension lines and shows similar features in heave moreover the rolls of the tunnel and immersion rig behave similar in both phase and amplitude fig 7 implies that the surge pitch and yaw of the tunnel is insignificant however the surge pitch and yaw of the immersion rig have a significant amplitude it is evident that surge and yaw of the rig is dominated by a dual wave periodic response of 20s while the rig s pitch is combined by a natural periodic response of 7s and a subharmonic response of 20s these subharmonic fluctuations can be generated from the strongly nonlinear hydrodynamic interaction among the tunnel and immersion rigs at resonance period of roll luckily perhaps to build up subharmonic motions of high amplitude the excitation needs to maintain very nicely behaved over quite some time journée et al 2015 thus when exposed to irregular seas this subharmonic motion would break down before large amplitude are generated as demonstrated in fig 16 3 2 2 effect of the wave period the variation of the motions of the tunnel immersion system is plotted versus the wave period with h 2 0m and β 90 in fig 8 in order to highlight the effect of the roll resonance the wave period is normalized by the roll period t roll 9s and the relative wave period t t roll ranges from 0 44 to 2 22 the 6 dof displacements are normalized by the wave amplitude a 1 0m the label te is short for tunnel element and ir is for immersion rig fig 8 shows that the sway of the tunnel and immersion rig has an increasing trend with the wave period meanwhile the heave of the tunnel and immersion rig both increase with the wave period and then tends to follow the water surface getting the local peaks at t t roll 1 33 interestingly asymmetric maxima and minima of the heave is observed in the tunnel due to the gravity effects of on deck water and lack of restoring force fig 8 also indicates that as the wave period increases the rolls of the tunnel and immersion rig experience an increase and then a decrease getting their peaks at t t roll 0 89 1 11 moreover the pitch resonance of the immersion rig occurs evidently at t t roll 0 78 but has no effect on the tunnel since it doesn t affect the connection point of the suspension lines additionally it should be noted that peak values of the surge pitch and yaw of the immersion rig occur at t t roll 1 11 1 22 this is because the amplified roll of the system could provoke the resonance of the trapped water among the floaters and lead to an asymmetric pressure distribution surrounding the immersion rigs to address the effect of green water quantitively the mean values of the heave of the tunnel and immersion rig are plotted against the relative wave period in fig 9 it shows that the mean heave values of the tunnel and immersion rig have a similar dependence on the relative wave period to the roll the mean heave value has its peak at t t roll 0 89 1 00 when the incident wave period is close to the roll period of the coupled system this is readily comprehensible that larger rolling oscillation leads to more drastic wave body interaction provoking larger amount of on deck water and stronger green water effect zhao et al 2014 moreover the mean heave of tunnel is the most significant at t t roll 0 78 1 33 when the roll amplitude of the tunnel is more than 2 deg and also leads to a large amplitude difference to that of the rig the relative motion rm the tunnel motion minus the synchronous immersion rig motion is presented in fig 10 it can be observed that the relative sway increases with the wave period for t t roll 0 56 1 00 gets a local peak at t t roll 1 00 and then decreases this can be attributed by the coupling effect of the resonance roll the relative motions in surge pitch and yaw directions are similar to those of the immersion rig due to the insignificant displacements of the tunnel most importantly the relative heave has relatively large amplitude in short waves of t t roll 1 11 and then decreases gradually with the wave period for longer waves getting its peak value at roll period of t t roll 1 11 this is linked to the significant mean heave value gap between tunnel and immersion rig when the roll resonance is excited as indicated by fig 9 moreover the relative roll has a significant decreasing trend with the wave period of t t roll 0 44 1 56 and keeps quasi steady with longer waves to investigate the tension distribution of the four suspension lines the standard deviation std and average values avg are discussed in this study the avg and std values are obtained respectively by 1 f a v g 1 4 i 1 4 f i 2 f s t d 1 4 i 1 4 f i f a v g 2 where f i represented the single suspension tension in the four suspension lines the maximum value of single tension std tension and avg tension normalized by the gravity of tunnel g are plotted with t t roll in fig 11 the results clearly show that for waves of t t roll 1 11 all the four suspension lines suffer high extreme tensions and the tension on seaward lines is significantly larger than leeward lines meanwhile the avg and std tensions also have significant values caused by the relative heave and relative roll respectively as revealed in fig 10 however under longer waves of t t roll 1 11 the maximum single suspension tension undergoes an evident decrease along with decreased avg and std tensions among the four suspension lines this is closely related to the reduced relative heave and relative roll and demonstrates an approximately even tension distribution and a relatively stable tunnel element specifically it can also be observed that both the maximum single tensions and avg tensions reach their local peaks at t t roll 1 11 when the wave period closes to the roll period it verifies that the resonance roll has a key effect on the dynamic responses of the suspension lines 3 2 3 effect of the wave height fig 12 shows variation of the six motion components of the tunnel immersion rig and their relative motion with h the wave height ranges from 0 5m to 3 0m with t 8s and β 90 a significant increase can be observed in the sway of the tunnel and immersion rig as the wave height grows albeit with small amplitude difference larger relative sway is reported for steeper waves due to the significant phase difference of the tunnel and immersion rig the surge of the tunnel and immersion rig together with the relative surge has a slowly increasing trend with wave height with respect to the heave of the tunnel and immersion rig the downward amplitude positive experiences an evident increase with the wave height while the upward amplitude negative has few changes also the effect of the wave height on the mean value of the heave is presented in fig 13 it indicates that the mean heave values are enlarged with an intensified tendency for higher waves specifically the mean heave value of the tunnel grows twice as that of the immersion rig leading to a significantly growing relative heave in steeper waves this can be related to the stronger influence of the green water in steeper waves which is induced by wave elevation larger exceedance over the tunnel top and more severe fluid structure interaction additionally the roll amplitudes of the tunnel immersion rig and relative motion have a significant growth under steeper waves in the pitch and yaw directions the tunnel motion increases slowly in steeper waves while the immersion rig motion exhibits a significant growth leading to a larger relative motion amplitude fig 14 a and b illustrates the effect of wave height on the maximum values of the single tension and the avg std values respectively the results indicate that as the incident wave height grows the maximum tension of all the four suspension lines experience an evident increase this is mainly contributed by the growth in the avg tension which is induced by the enlarged relative heave as indicated in fig 12 moreover steeper wave leads to greater std tension due to larger relative roll thus it can be concluded that steeper waves would intensify the instability of the tunnel immersion system and thus seriously unbalance the tension distribution among the four suspension lines 3 2 4 effect of the incident angle fig 15 illustrates the comparison of tunnel rig motion and their relative motion under incident angles of β 90 and β 75 parameters of regular waves t t roll 0 56 1 56 and a 1 0m were applied it shows that the sway of the tunnel under β 75 is smaller than that under β 90 in the test scope the wave incident angle has minor effect on the sway of the immersion rig and the relative sway the surge of the tunnel pontoon and the relative surge under β 75 is slightly larger than that under β 90 with t t roll 1 11 1 56 noteworthy compared to β 90 the downward displacement of the tunnel is significantly decreased under β 75 for t t roll 0 56 0 78 but its upward displacement exhibits a slight increase this is because the oblique waves of β 75 weakens the influence of the on deck water and leads to a smaller downward offset for the tunnel moreover the relative heave decreases a bit in downward direction but has larger value in upward direction for β 75 the rolls of the tunnel and immersion rig have smaller amplitudes for β 75 and the decrease is most evident for t t roll 0 78 1 33 moreover the relative roll is larger with β 75 than that of β 90 for t t roll 0 56 0 89 but is affected little by β for longer waves this is probably due to the enlarged phase lag of the tunnel and immersion rig motions in oblique waves the pitch and yaw amplitudes of the tunnel for β 75 are slightly larger than that of β 90 however for the pitch and yaw of the immersion rig great local peaks are exhibited at t t roll 0 78 for β 75 leading to significant relative motions in this direction this should be considered carefully since it could arise high risks of collision between tunnel and immersion rigs in close proximity and jeopardize the structural safety and operation security fig 16 a b compare the maximum values of the line tension 1 3 the avg tension and std tension for β 90 and β 75 with a 1 0m and t t roll 0 56 1 56 as shown in fig 16 a basically the maximum single suspension tension under oblique waves of β 75 is smaller than that under beam wave of β 90 for the seaward line of rig 1 however the most critical single tension is observed under β 75 rather than β 90 for t t roll 0 56 0 89 which leads to a more uneven tension distribution among the four lines consequently with t t roll 0 56 0 89 the avg value of the suspension tensions becomes smaller for β 75 and the std value of the suspension tensions greater than that of β 90 however for longer wave conditions the std value of the suspension tensions is limited affected by the wave obliquity this can be closely associated with the larger relative roll for β 75 especially when the shielding effect is important in short waves of t t roll 0 56 0 89 refer to the most critical single suspension tension observed it is recommended to investigate the dynamic response of coupled multi floater under oblique wave as well as the beam wave to ensure the worst case scenario being captured 3 3 responses of the tunnel immersion system in irregular waves 3 3 1 motion characteristics of the tunnel and immersion rig fig 17 shows motion time history of the tunnel element coupled with immersion rig under typical sea state of h s 1 5m t p 9s β 90 it indicates that the predominant motions the sway heave and roll of the immersion rig and tunnel behave similar to each other a slow swaying motion of the tunnel and immersion rig is observed as well as the oscillations in wave frequency while the heave and roll are governed by the wave frequency response in addition the tunnel experiences larger amplitude in sway and heave than those of the immersion rig it implies that the zero freeboard tunnel is very sensitive to wave excitation moreover the tunnel and pontoon show different motion characteristics for the surge pitch and yaw which will be discussed further in the spectral analysis below to further explore the motion characteristics and dynamic properties of the tunnel immersion system spectral analysis was performed by fft for the tunnel immersion rig their relative motion and the suspension tensions based on the time domain measurements the spectra of 6 dofs of the tunnel element immersion rig and their synchronous relative motion were compared in fig 18 a f with h s 1 5m t p 6 20s t p t roll 0 67 2 22 and β 90 from fig 18 a it can be clearly seen that the sway of tunnel element is dominant by the resonant response at low frequency of t p t roll 0 67 1 22 induced by the significant slowly varying drift force while for t p t roll 1 55 2 22 the wave frequency sway becomes important as well for the immersion rig sway is dominated by wave frequency component for t p t roll 0 67 2 22 therefore the relative sway is dominated by combined low frequency and wave frequency components for t p t roll 0 67 1 22 and by low frequency component for t p t roll 1 55 2 22 as illustrated in fig 18 b the surge of tunnel element is dominated by low frequency of f 0 008hz subjecting to the mooring configuration the surge of the immersion rig has three peaks at f 0 04hz 0 11hz and 0 15hz in according to the surge roll and pitch resonance frequency of the two immersion rigs for t p t roll 0 67 1 22 for longer waves the surge of the immersion rig concentrates its energy in f 0 04hz consequently the relative surge reveals similar spectral features with the rig s surge fig 18 c shows that the heave of the tunnel and immersion rig are consistent in shape and dominated by the wave frequency except for the jonswap spectral peak frequency the relative heave spectra also exhibit peaks in low frequency f 0 022hz and high frequency f 0 25hz which can be corresponding to the in phase heave and anti phase heave of the tunnel and immersion rigs respectively in fig 18 d the roll of the tunnel and immersion rig is dominated by the wave frequency motion for short waves of t p t roll 0 67 1 11 while for longer waves the roll is also affected by the in phase roll resonance frequency of f 0 11hz this is due to the largest rao value of the natural frequency in fig 7 thus the wave component close to the roll frequency contained in the incident wave spectra should be considered carefully since small energy could lead to a significant response correspondingly the relative roll exhibits its peak at wave peak frequency and roll frequency under t p t roll 0 67 1 11 and t p t roll 1 22 2 22 respectively fig 18 e reveals that the pitch of the tunnel is controlled by the wave frequency response whereas the pitch of the immersion rig is governed by its natural frequency of f 0 15hz as well as affected by the roll resonance for waves of t p t roll 0 78 2 22 correspondingly the relative pitch is distinctly focused in f 0 15hz and also presents a small peak in f 0 11hz in long waves which reinforces the coupling effect of the resonance roll as shown in fig 18 f the yaw of the tunnel and the immersion rig are both dominated by their natural frequencies which subject to the characteristics of the mooring system in combination with the hydrodynamic interaction among the floaters the low frequency yaw of the tunnel lies in 0 015 hz corresponding to the natural frequency of the tunnel s yaw in contrast the immersion rig s yaw is dominant in f 0 025hz close to the mode frequency of the anti phase yaw of the two immersion rigs and also affected by the roll resonance response of f 0 11hz the relative yaw behaves similar to the yaw of the immersion rig 3 3 2 characteristic of the suspension tension the tensions of the four suspension wires under irregular waves of h s 1 5m t p 9s is included in fig 19 to observe the snap load and slack clearly a typical duration of 200s is zoomed in and presented from the completed time history of 1200s 1 and 3 are seaward suspension wires and 2 and 4 are leeward wires it is revealed that the seaward suspension tension is larger than the leeward tension due to the significant relative roll in addition frequent slack and snap load are observed in the suspension tensions note that the slack and snap load occurs in the whole test scope and is most significant at the roll resonance period this is due to the dynamic tension induced by the relative motions between the tunnel and immersion rigs and the zero pre tension in suspension lines during freeboard elimination this can jeopardize the suspension system and is strictly not allowed during the immersion the spectra analysis of the seaward and leeward suspension tensions under irregular waves of various peak waves periods are displayed in fig 20 it should be pointed out that the spectra of the suspension tension exhibit multi peak characteristics except for the wave peak frequency the other three peaks are f 0 02hz 0 11hz and 0 25hz which is close to the natural frequency of the in phase heave the in phase roll and the anti phase heave of the tunnel and immersion rigs respectively among these peaks the wave spectral frequency shows the maximum peak value at t p t roll 1 00 whereas t p t roll 1 00 another significant peak value occurs at the roll natural frequency of f 0 11hz and even becomes dominant in the leeward tensions thus the wave component corresponding to the roll frequency in the jonswap spectra plays an essential role in the dynamic responses of the suspension lines especially for longer waves of t p t roll 1 00 and should be considered carefully 4 conclusion to investigate the coupling mechanism of the tunnel and immersion rig system the relative motion between the tunnel and rigs and the suspension tensions are measured simultaneously extensive data analysis has been performed and the following conclusions have been drawn 1 from eigen value analysis of the tunnel immersion system there are 18 modes coupled by different degrees of freedom the in phase roll of the tunnel and immersion rigs plays a key role in the dynamic responses of the system 2 during freeboard elimination green water has a significant effect on the downward displacement of the tunnel and leads to severe relative heave and critical dynamic suspension tensions the relative heave and maximum suspension tensions reach peaks close to the roll resonance period which is considered as the most critical scenario 3 for t t roll all of the four suspension lines experience high level dynamic loadings with the seaward tensions larger than leeward ones which can be attributed to the significant relative heave combined with the relative roll for t t roll however the tension distribution among four lines becomes more even due to the decreasing relative roll 4 comparing to beam wave the oblique wave of β 75 leads to larger maximum tension on single suspension line and produces a worse uneven distribution among the four suspension tensions for t t roll 0 56 0 89 to ensure the worst case scenario being captured it is recommended to consider the oblique wave on dynamic responses of the coupled floaters system as well as the beam wave acknowledgements the
