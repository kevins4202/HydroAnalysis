ctp hilow framework aims at distinguishing dry soil advantage from wet soil advantage based on land surface conditions ctp is calculated by integrating the area between moist adiabat and atmospheric temperature profile between pressure levels 100 hpa and 300 hpa agl mathematically ctp is calculated as 1 ctp z ψ s 100 h p a z ψ s 300 h p a g t vp t env t env d z where ψs surface pressure tvp air

convective available potential energy cape but with different integration bounds ctp j kg calculates the buoyancy of rising air with respect to the difference of temperature between the air parcel and the environment positive values of ctp shows a conditional instability between pressure levels of 100 hpa and 300 hpa agl sufficient energy will be available to trigger convection when abl reaches this height to say otherwise maximum kinetic energy a buoyant air parcel could have when it rises from 900 hpa to 700 hpa pressure level when surface pressure is assumed at 1000 hpa the basic assumption is that the air parcel ascends without mixing and instantaneous adjustment to external environmental pressure ctp value is negative if the observed potential temperature is greater than the

follows that of roundy et al 2012 fig 1 which was developed and demonstrated over the southeastern united states u s we extend this work by analyzing seasonal impacts on sm p feedbacks over india fig 2 regime classification is performed by considering 3 dimensional d scatter space of ctp hi and sm it was reduced to 2 d space considering ctp and hi with sm in the third dimension this 2 d space was further classified into ctp hi bin spaces ranging from 10 to 65 and kolmogorov smirnov ks two sample test was performed to classify bins into dry wet transition and atmospherically controlled regimes the test was carried out at various significance levels ranging from 95 to 99 many ensembles are run with varying significance values for k s two sample test and bin sizes to avoid any bias in the final classification finally all bin sizes were brought to a uniform bin size of 65 for uniformity using the nearest neighbor method of regridding within each bin complete time series distribution of soil moisture is computed between the years 2005 2015 and it was compared to the distribution of bin samples of sm the rationale behind this methodology is to classify regimes by comparing complete seasonal time series between 2005 and 2015 for sm distribution across all ctp hi bins and checking whether it is wetter or drier within each ctp hi bin the final classification map is produced using bin probability of regime i e the regime having a probability greater than 0 6 within each bin was classified into the same regime these classification maps can be used as lookup tables for generating spatial regime maps by looking up value ranges of ctp and hi if no regime had a probability greater than 0 6 that bin was classified as transitional further we calculate the regime frequencies within each pixel of the spatial domain to evaluate the dominance of each regime for all three seasons we term this as temporal regime probability trp value which elucidates on the probability of occurrence for a spatial pixel and dominant regime over the decade 2005 2015 data was segregated into 3 major seasons of india namely pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon final spatial maps of classification are generated by using the methodology already mentioned above based on early morning temperature and humidity profiles the study area is classified into four distinct regimes dry wet transitional atmospherically controlled convective rainfall triggered over dry soils are classified as dry coupling regime similarly local convective rainfall triggered over wet soils is called a wet coupling regime if there is no significant difference between bin sm distribution and marginal distribution of soil moisture the region was classified as a transitional regime the transitional regime suggests that convection can be triggered either over wet or dry soil conditions a region is classified as atmospherically controlled when local partitioning of fluxes due to antecedent sm doesn t contribute to convection triggering due to large scale synoptic factors insufficient samples of sm within each bin are classified as atmospherically controlled this is because roundy et al 2012 suggested that coupling is a frequent process and insufficient data translates to inherent randomness atmospherically controlled cases are also attributed to the high temporal variability of hi net surface radiation becomes positive after sunrise marking the initiation of energy transmission into the boundary layer bl the height and structure of early morning pbl largely depend on large scale fluxes of surface heat and moisture especially when large scale synoptic forcing like atmospheric circulation monsoon topography etc are absent ferguson and wood 2011 sensible heat sh and latent heat lh are the two important variables that determine convective triggering and these two variables can be collectively represented by the ratio of sensible to latent heat fluxes known as bowen ratio convection can occur either on wet or dry soil conditions convection is triggered on wet soils where soil moisture is generally on the higher range which in turn increases lh further moistening the bl lower values of surface net radiation and sh restrict the growth of bl in such cases and lfc comes down to the level of bl because of large moist static energy mse similarly rainfall doesn t occur in cases where the bowen ratio is considerably low creating stable atmospheric conditions this restricts air parcels to move vertically thus preventing moist air from reaching lfc in the case of dry soils sh is much larger compared to lh intensifying the growth of bl and increased entrainment above bl this forms a cycle and the process starts feeding back itself due to the large bowen ratio this cycle is broken if there are large scale synoptic factors stronger than feedback entekhabi et al 1996 dry soils are thus generally characterized by large bowen ratio low mse causing intense entrainment to occur above bl convection is inhibited in this case due to low mse per unit mass of bl air rainfall occurs on dry soils if the temperature profile is dry adiabatic ctp greater than 200 j kg opposite from the case of wet triggering convection is triggered when bl grows up to lfc 5 results the ctp hilow framework proposed by roundy et al 2012 is a regional framework and cannot be applied at a global scale fig 3 represents the range of ctp and hilow values for premonsoon monsoon and postmonsoon seasons based on an analysis of merra2 ctp data over the study domain for the period 2005 2015 ctp decreases approximately linearly from premonsoon to postmonsoon premonsoon season exhibited a higher range of ctp values varying between 200 and 350 j kg compared to monsoon 50 150 j kg and postmonsoon 0 150 j kg seasons all seasons exhibited extreme negative values of ctp over the north and some parts of the northeastern region also hi values reached up to 80 c compared to roundy et al 2012 whose hi values maxed at 35 c in their study region atmospherically controlled regimes were prominent in all the 3 seasons fig 4 represent seasonal averages of ctp hilow sm and precipitation for pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon respectively during pre monsoon season the observed range of ctp hilow values all over india favor convection triggering except negative values of ctp over hatched regions in north and northeast see fig 1 we attribute this anomalous behavior to possible western disturbances over these regions in contrast to this we observe lower values of hilow in the southernmost part of india also the combination of higher soil moisture lower hilow 20 c and higher ctp 200 j kg 1 indicates wet coupling over the region based on the slab model proposed by findell and eltahir 2003b and same is evident in the final classification of pre monsoon dominant regime over the southern part of india monsoon seasonal average exhibits a noticeable increase in sm due to monsoon rainfall during june july august and september jjas ctp hilow fails to capture convective triggering in this case as the framework does not consider advective moisture during monsoon the atmospherically controlled regime is consistent and covers most of the area within india partially indicating incapability of framework to capture convective triggering during the presence of southwest monsoon southern india shows wet coupling during the post monsoon season and central india remains an atmospherically controlled regime the dry coupling regime was much more prominent in the northwestern part of india for all three seasons when the summer monsoon has completely retreated atmospherically controlled situations start prevailing without any convection regardless of surface conditions in central india extending to east classification within 2d ctp hilow space for all seasons is represented in fig 5 b d f pre monsoon season represents a large range of bins in ctp hilow classified in to dry and atmospherically controlled regime it is observed that ctp values reached dramatically lower values 500 j kg 1 this case only occurred in regions of the extreme north and northeast india other areas displayed reasonable ranges of ctp hilow values when compared to past literature fig 5a c e bin probabilities for each regime classified separately for all three seasons fig 6 represents the trp values calculated for different regimes considered in the study the rationale used to calculate bin probability plots was extended over here for the spatial domain higher trp values suggest the most dominant regime over the region postmonsoon showed considerably higher trp values for dry regime over central india and the wet regime over southern india during pre monsoon central india had higher probabilities of the dry regime this can be well substantiated by the fact that these regions are highly dry during summers and have soil wetness 20 see fig 4c there is a chance that these conditions favor more significant sensible heat fluxes thus triggering convection through the growth of boundary layer reaching level of free convection lfc also the temporal regime probability trp during pre monsoon clearly highlights regions of wet advantage over southern states hatched regions in the south see fig 1 exhibiting contrastingly higher trp values favoring wet advantage the spatial extent of the wet advantage regime got extended towards the eastern part of south india the hatched region in the south fig 1 during the post monsoon season additionally the dry advantage regime is having a lesser areal extent when compared to the pre monsoon season in fig 6d h l regions without any atmospherically controlled regime were classified as nan this is the reason for some of the values to be blank and only those regions with a minimum one occurrence of the atmospherically controlled regime have trp value nearer to zero regions where no regime was dominant was reclassified as atmospherically controlled indicating inherent randomness in those regions fig 7 represents final spatial classification maps generated using the final ctp hilow space used as the lookup table the dry regime extends till central india during pre monsoon and the southern part is mostly dominated by wet advantage during monsoon the framework demonstrates larger atmospherically controlled regimes this might be due to large scale advective moisture brought in by southwest monsoon it was observed that during post monsoon dry regime retreats from central india and is much more consistent around northwestern parts of india this regime behavior can be attributed to inherent drier land covers involving dry barren fallow lands at this part of india fig 1 the northernmost part of india is mostly covered by snow and steep topography which exhibits high spatial variability in classification fig 8 shows the bin plots of sm merra2 rainfall cmorph event depth maximum accumulated afternoon plus evening rainfall depth given merra2 hilow and ctp final classification for 3 seasons of india we limit our analysis for the regions within 200 600 j kg of ctp as the majority of classified regime structure falls within this range the figure demonstrates an abundance of higher accumulated rainfall depth for the regions with hilow ranging between 0 and 20 c reiterating the findings of findell and eltahir 2003 we observe that the bins which fall under wet regime classification for all the seasons display higher accumulated rainfall depths when compared to regions of dry coupling in the ctp hilow space also we observe a linearly varying structure of sm accumulated depth values for all seasons cascading gradually as we move from wet coupling 0 hilow 20 c to dry coupling 20 hilow 80 c thus the coupling regimes classified as dry coupled received the lesser accumulated depth of rainfall when compared to regions classified as wet coupled these results are partially in agreement with outcomes obtained by ferguson and wood 2011 during the monsoon season we observe similar regime advantage patterns mentioned by koster et al 2014 with wet regime being dominant in central and western india based on the trp values fig 6 fig 9 demonstrates dominant regimes and their respective spatial coverage over india 47 of the area was classified as atmospherically controlled premonsoon 28 displayed a higher percentage of dry coupling regime when compared to other seasons wet regime covered about 21 of the area including south north and northeastern regions transitional regimes covered small areas 4 5 for all the seasons combined the highest areal coverage 75 for the atmospherically controlled regime was observed during monsoon this result reiterates past studies that suggested large scale synoptic forcing especially advective moisture might have caused such large coverage of atmospherically controlled regime during monsoon wet regime and dry regimes constituted around 13 and 7 of total area respectively during postmonsoon 61 of the area was atmospherically controlled and covered central and eastern regions dry regime increased after the monsoon retreated and covered 21 of the area towards western india our study is limited to understanding local triggering of rainfall in various regime spaces based on sm and atmospheric temperature profiles however atmospherically controlled regimes may be actually dominated by atmospheric moisture transfer and convergence when local soil moisture impact is not substantial in this sense our results are consistent with that of wei et al 2016 their study found that the effects of moisture flux convergence is more significant compared to local sm in the southern united states non local impacts might be reflected as atmospherically controlled cases in our study especially during the monsoon season during monsoon indian land mass displays intra seasonal variability of heavy and low rainfalls known as active and break period and most of the precipitation during this period are because of large moisture transport from terrestrial and oceanic sources pathak et al 2017 wei and dirmeyer 2019 highlighted the influence of evapotranspiration and non local impacts on precipitation based on non local moisture sources however it should be noted that the present study aims to solely understand the local impacts of sm on p over india study of non local impacts shall be taken up as a part of future study 6 discussion and conclusions the ctp hilow framework has demonstrated immense potential in understanding the triggering of deep convection during the late afternoon over the past decade the loco working group has developed a suite of l a coupling metrics as proper observations were not available to validate model output with respect to l a interactions accuracy of land surface models can be increased by improving the model parameterization scheme along with the aid of coupling metrics to understand such complex interactions india is one of the countries that largely depend on agriculture for the economy and monsoon is a significant factor that determines the indian economy there is a need to understand l a interactions in india at seasonal scales current research aims at comprehending such interactions and improving the model s prediction skill we observe larger accumulated depths of rainfall with increasing soil moisture within ctp hilow space nonetheless the effects of vegetation or irrigation feedbacks cannot be ignored our study evaluates the potential of ctp hi low to predict various feedback regimes both spatially and temporally over india it was observed that during monsoon season atmospherically controlled cases dominated over other feedback cases this was a significant observation based on our results modeled ctp hilow values were substantially low in northern and north eastern regions which could be the result of steep topography snow the himalayan belt which extends till the eastern part of india in contrast to this it becomes increasingly difficult to discern the potential reasons behind such values when events like western disturbances are prominent in those parts of india hunt et al 2018 imamovic et al 2017 conducted studies on the combined impact of soil moisture orography and precipitation they observed that soil moisture is not of much importance in feedbacks for steep orography and suggested that mountains of altitude greater than 500 m are sufficient to neutralize local sm p feedbacks reanalysis datasets might fail to capture the impacts of irrigation on flux partitioning and consequent precipitation datasets like era 5 provide data at higher resolutions but this is beyond the domain of the current study there is scope for future studies using such datasets to investigate their performance for regime classification and forecast climatological extremes roundy and santanello 2017 declaration of

follows that of roundy et al 2012 fig 1 which was developed and demonstrated over the southeastern united states u s we extend this work by analyzing seasonal impacts on sm p feedbacks over india fig 2 regime classification is performed by considering 3 dimensional d scatter space of ctp hi and sm it was reduced to 2 d space considering ctp and hi with sm in the third dimension this 2 d space was further classified into ctp hi bin spaces ranging from 10 to 65 and kolmogorov smirnov ks two sample test was performed to classify bins into dry wet transition and atmospherically controlled regimes the test was carried out at various significance levels ranging from 95 to 99 many ensembles are run with varying significance values for k s two sample test and bin sizes to avoid any bias in the final classification finally all bin sizes were brought to a uniform bin size of 65 for uniformity using the nearest neighbor method of regridding within each bin complete time series distribution of soil moisture is computed between the years 2005 2015 and it was compared to the distribution of bin samples of sm the rationale behind this methodology is to classify regimes by comparing complete seasonal time series between 2005 and 2015 for sm distribution across all ctp hi bins and checking whether it is wetter or drier within each ctp hi bin the final classification map is produced using bin probability of regime i e the regime having a probability greater than 0 6 within each bin was classified into the same regime these classification maps can be used as lookup tables for generating spatial regime maps by looking up value ranges of ctp and hi if no regime had a probability greater than 0 6 that bin was classified as transitional further we calculate the regime frequencies within each pixel of the spatial domain to evaluate the dominance of each regime for all three seasons we term this as temporal regime probability trp value which elucidates on the probability of occurrence for a spatial pixel and dominant regime over the decade 2005 2015 data was segregated into 3 major seasons of india namely pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon final spatial maps of classification are generated by using the methodology already mentioned above based on early morning temperature and humidity profiles the study area is classified into four distinct regimes dry wet transitional atmospherically controlled convective rainfall triggered over dry soils are classified as dry coupling regime similarly local convective rainfall triggered over wet soils is called a wet coupling regime if there is no significant difference between bin sm distribution and marginal distribution of soil moisture the region was classified as a transitional regime the transitional regime suggests that convection can be triggered either over wet or dry soil conditions a region is classified as atmospherically controlled when local partitioning of fluxes due to antecedent sm doesn t contribute to convection triggering due to large scale synoptic factors insufficient samples of sm within each bin are classified as atmospherically controlled this is because roundy et al 2012 suggested that coupling is a frequent process and insufficient data translates to inherent randomness atmospherically controlled cases are also attributed to the high temporal variability of hi net surface radiation becomes positive after sunrise marking the initiation of energy transmission into the boundary layer bl the height and structure of early morning pbl largely depend on large scale fluxes of surface heat and moisture especially when large scale synoptic forcing like atmospheric circulation monsoon topography etc are absent ferguson and wood 2011 sensible heat sh and latent heat lh are the two important variables that determine convective triggering and these two variables can be collectively represented by the ratio of sensible to latent heat fluxes known as bowen ratio convection can occur either on wet or dry soil conditions convection is triggered on wet soils where soil moisture is generally on the higher range which in turn increases lh further moistening the bl lower values of surface net radiation and sh restrict the growth of bl in such cases and lfc comes down to the level of bl because of large moist static energy mse similarly rainfall doesn t occur in cases where the bowen ratio is considerably low creating stable atmospheric conditions this restricts air parcels to move vertically thus preventing moist air from reaching lfc in the case of dry soils sh is much larger compared to lh intensifying the growth of bl and increased entrainment above bl this forms a cycle and the process starts feeding back itself due to the large bowen ratio this cycle is broken if there are large scale synoptic factors stronger than feedback entekhabi et al 1996 dry soils are thus generally characterized by large bowen ratio low mse causing intense entrainment to occur above bl convection is inhibited in this case due to low mse per unit mass of bl air rainfall occurs on dry soils if the temperature profile is dry adiabatic ctp greater than 200 j kg opposite from the case of wet triggering convection is triggered when bl grows up to lfc 5 results the ctp hilow framework proposed by roundy et al 2012 is a regional framework and cannot be applied at a global scale fig 3 represents the range of ctp and hilow values for premonsoon monsoon and postmonsoon seasons based on an analysis of merra2 ctp data over the study domain for the period 2005 2015 ctp decreases approximately linearly from premonsoon to postmonsoon premonsoon season exhibited a higher range of ctp values varying between 200 and 350 j kg compared to monsoon 50 150 j kg and postmonsoon 0 150 j kg seasons all seasons exhibited extreme negative values of ctp over the north and some parts of the northeastern region also hi values reached up to 80 c compared to roundy et al 2012 whose hi values maxed at 35 c in their study region atmospherically controlled regimes were prominent in all the 3 seasons fig 4 represent seasonal averages of ctp hilow sm and precipitation for pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon respectively during pre monsoon season the observed range of ctp hilow values all over india favor convection triggering except negative values of ctp over hatched regions in north and northeast see fig 1 we attribute this anomalous behavior to possible western disturbances over these regions in contrast to this we observe lower values of hilow in the southernmost part of india also the combination of higher soil moisture lower hilow 20 c and higher ctp 200 j kg 1 indicates wet coupling over the region based on the slab model proposed by findell and eltahir 2003b and same is evident in the final classification of pre monsoon dominant regime over the southern part of india monsoon seasonal average exhibits a noticeable increase in sm due to monsoon rainfall during june july august and september jjas ctp hilow fails to capture convective triggering in this case as the framework does not consider advective moisture during monsoon the atmospherically controlled regime is consistent and covers most of the area within india partially indicating incapability of framework to capture convective triggering during the presence of southwest monsoon southern india shows wet coupling during the post monsoon season and central india remains an atmospherically controlled regime the dry coupling regime was much more prominent in the northwestern part of india for all three seasons when the summer monsoon has completely retreated atmospherically controlled situations start prevailing without any convection regardless of surface conditions in central india extending to east classification within 2d ctp hilow space for all seasons is represented in fig 5 b d f pre monsoon season represents a large range of bins in ctp hilow classified in to dry and atmospherically controlled regime it is observed that ctp values reached dramatically lower values 500 j kg 1 this case only occurred in regions of the extreme north and northeast india other areas displayed reasonable ranges of ctp hilow values when compared to past literature fig 5a c e bin probabilities for each regime classified separately for all three seasons fig 6 represents the trp values calculated for different regimes considered in the study the rationale used to calculate bin probability plots was extended over here for the spatial domain higher trp values suggest the most dominant regime over the region postmonsoon showed considerably higher trp values for dry regime over central india and the wet regime over southern india during pre monsoon central india had higher probabilities of the dry regime this can be well substantiated by the fact that these regions are highly dry during summers and have soil wetness 20 see fig 4c there is a chance that these conditions favor more significant sensible heat fluxes thus triggering convection through the growth of boundary layer reaching level of free convection lfc also the temporal regime probability trp during pre monsoon clearly highlights regions of wet advantage over southern states hatched regions in the south see fig 1 exhibiting contrastingly higher trp values favoring wet advantage the spatial extent of the wet advantage regime got extended towards the eastern part of south india the hatched region in the south fig 1 during the post monsoon season additionally the dry advantage regime is having a lesser areal extent when compared to the pre monsoon season in fig 6d h l regions without any atmospherically controlled regime were classified as nan this is the reason for some of the values to be blank and only those regions with a minimum one occurrence of the atmospherically controlled regime have trp value nearer to zero regions where no regime was dominant was reclassified as atmospherically controlled indicating inherent randomness in those regions fig 7 represents final spatial classification maps generated using the final ctp hilow space used as the lookup table the dry regime extends till central india during pre monsoon and the southern part is mostly dominated by wet advantage during monsoon the framework demonstrates larger atmospherically controlled regimes this might be due to large scale advective moisture brought in by southwest monsoon it was observed that during post monsoon dry regime retreats from central india and is much more consistent around northwestern parts of india this regime behavior can be attributed to inherent drier land covers involving dry barren fallow lands at this part of india fig 1 the northernmost part of india is mostly covered by snow and steep topography which exhibits high spatial variability in classification fig 8 shows the bin plots of sm merra2 rainfall cmorph event depth maximum accumulated afternoon plus evening rainfall depth given merra2 hilow and ctp final classification for 3 seasons of india we limit our analysis for the regions within 200 600 j kg of ctp as the majority of classified regime structure falls within this range the figure demonstrates an abundance of higher accumulated rainfall depth for the regions with hilow ranging between 0 and 20 c reiterating the findings of findell and eltahir 2003 we observe that the bins which fall under wet regime classification for all the seasons display higher accumulated rainfall depths when compared to regions of dry coupling in the ctp hilow space also we observe a linearly varying structure of sm accumulated depth values for all seasons cascading gradually as we move from wet coupling 0 hilow 20 c to dry coupling 20 hilow 80 c thus the coupling regimes classified as dry coupled received the lesser accumulated depth of rainfall when compared to regions classified as wet coupled these results are partially in agreement with outcomes obtained by ferguson and wood 2011 during the monsoon season we observe similar regime advantage patterns mentioned by koster et al 2014 with wet regime being dominant in central and western india based on the trp values fig 6 fig 9 demonstrates dominant regimes and their respective spatial coverage over india 47 of the area was classified as atmospherically controlled premonsoon 28 displayed a higher percentage of dry coupling regime when compared to other seasons wet regime covered about 21 of the area including south north and northeastern regions transitional regimes covered small areas 4 5 for all the seasons combined the highest areal coverage 75 for the atmospherically controlled regime was observed during monsoon this result reiterates past studies that suggested large scale synoptic forcing especially advective moisture might have caused such large coverage of atmospherically controlled regime during monsoon wet regime and dry regimes constituted around 13 and 7 of total area respectively during postmonsoon 61 of the area was atmospherically controlled and covered central and eastern regions dry regime increased after the monsoon retreated and covered 21 of the area towards western india our study is limited to understanding local triggering of rainfall in various regime spaces based on sm and atmospheric temperature profiles however atmospherically controlled regimes may be actually dominated by atmospheric moisture transfer and convergence when local soil moisture impact is not substantial in this sense our results are consistent with that of wei et al 2016 their study found that the effects of moisture flux convergence is more significant compared to local sm in the southern united states non local impacts might be reflected as atmospherically controlled cases in our study especially during the monsoon season during monsoon indian land mass displays intra seasonal variability of heavy and low rainfalls known as active and break period and most of the precipitation during this period are because of large moisture transport from terrestrial and oceanic sources pathak et al 2017 wei and dirmeyer 2019 highlighted the influence of evapotranspiration and non local impacts on precipitation based on non local moisture sources however it should be noted that the present study aims to solely understand the local impacts of sm on p over india study of non local impacts shall be taken up as a part of future study 6 discussion and conclusions the ctp hilow framework has demonstrated immense potential in understanding the triggering of deep convection during the late afternoon over the past decade the loco working group has developed a suite of l a coupling metrics as proper observations were not available to validate model output with respect to l a interactions accuracy of land surface models can be increased by improving the model parameterization scheme along with the aid of coupling metrics to understand such complex interactions india is one of the countries that largely depend on agriculture for the economy and monsoon is a significant factor that determines the indian economy there is a need to understand l a interactions in india at seasonal scales current research aims at comprehending such interactions and improving the model s prediction skill we observe larger accumulated depths of rainfall with increasing soil moisture within ctp hilow space nonetheless the effects of vegetation or irrigation feedbacks cannot be ignored our study evaluates the potential of ctp hi low to predict various feedback regimes both spatially and temporally over india it was observed that during monsoon season atmospherically controlled cases dominated over other feedback cases this was a significant observation based on our results modeled ctp hilow values were substantially low in northern and north eastern regions which could be the result of steep topography snow the himalayan belt which extends till the eastern part of india in contrast to this it becomes increasingly difficult to discern the potential reasons behind such values when events like western disturbances are prominent in those parts of india hunt et al 2018 imamovic et al 2017 conducted studies on the combined impact of soil moisture orography and precipitation they observed that soil moisture is not of much importance in feedbacks for steep orography and suggested that mountains of altitude greater than 500 m are sufficient to neutralize local sm p feedbacks reanalysis datasets might fail to capture the impacts of irrigation on flux partitioning and consequent precipitation datasets like era 5 provide data at higher resolutions but this is beyond the domain of the current study there is scope for future studies using such datasets to investigate their performance for regime classification and forecast climatological extremes roundy and santanello 2017 declaration of

5271,in the framework of porosity models for large scale urban floods this work presents a method to compute the spatial distribution of the porosity parameters of complex urban areas by analyzing the footprints of buildings and obstacles precisely an algorithm is described that estimates the four parameters required by the differential dual porosity formulation we recently presented in this formulation beside the common isotropic porosity accounting for the reduced storage volume due to buildings a cell based conveyance porosity is introduced in the momentum equations in tensor form to model anisotropic resistances and alterations in the flow direction due to presence of preferential pathways such as streets a cell averaged description of the spatial connectivity in the urban medium and of the preferential flow directions is the main ingredient for robust and mesh independent estimates to achieve this goal the algorithm here presented automatically extracts the spatially distributed porosity fields of urban layouts relying only on geometrical information thus avoiding additional calibration effort the proposed method is described with the aid of schematic applications and then tested by simulating the flooding of complex urban areas using structured cartesian grids a fortran implementation of the algorithm is made available for free download and use keywords urban flood porosity model conveyance porosity porous shallow water equations spatially distributed porosity field anisotropic friction structured grid 1 introduction urban flooding is recognised as a global challenge exacerbated by the growth of megacities in flood prone areas by anthropogenic modifications of landscapes and by climate change as well arnell and gosling 2016 jongman et al 2012 tanoue et al 2016 viero et al 2019 the adoption of structural measures and complementary strategies to reduce the effects of floods kundzewicz et al 2018 mel et al 2020 the achievement of increased resilience ferrari et al 2020a mcclymont et al 2020 and effective adaptation jongman 2018 muis et al 2015 radhakrishnan et al 2018 all rely on the knowledge of the processes involved the need of assessing flood hazard accurately entails the need of suitable modelling tools for large scale urban floods sanders 2017 sanders and schubert 2019 vacondio et al 2016 wing et al 2018 in this view subgrid porosity models for urban floods reproduce the effects of fine scale topography at a relatively coarse resolution allowing physics based large scale applications with limited need of computational resources this kind of models has been the subject of ongoing research and of numerous applications braschi and gallati 1989 bruwier et al 2017 chen et al 2012a b costabile et al 2020 cozzolino et al 2018 defina 2000 defina et al 1994 ferrari et al 2020b 2017 guinot 2012 guinot et al 2017 özgen et al 2016 sanders et al 2008 varra et al 2020 yu and lane 2011 2006 here we draw the reader s attention to the dual porosity model in differential form recently proposed by viero 2019 and ferrari et al 2019 in which an isotropic porosity accounts for storage reduction due to the presence of buildings and a direction dependent conveyance porosity is introduced in the momentum equations in tensor form to account for anisotropic resistances exerted by buildings and obstacles and for the presence of preferential pathways both the storage and the conveyance porosities are defined at the cell level the model retains the mesh independence typical of porosity models in differential form and the natural inclusion of anisotropic effects related to alignment of buildings and obstacles typical of integral porosity models guinot et al 2017 sanders et al 2008 in previous contributions the model by ferrari et al 2019 and viero 2019 was only tested using uniform porosity parameters averaged within the urban area and assigned to all the computational cells therein actually to our knowledge porosity models in differential form were all used with uniform porosity so far e g cea and vázquez cendón 2010 guinot 2012 guinot and soares frazão 2006 soares frazao et al 2008 with the only exception of the exploratory study by soares frazão et al 2018 the use of uniform porosity parameters allows verifying the model skills in terms of global resistance exerted by a patch of urbanized area on the surrounding flow yet it offers no chance of describing the spatial variability of the flow field within the urban area moreover it has to be admitted that for increasingly larger urban areas uniform porosity parameters become as difficult to estimate as meaningless from a physical point of view that is to say the modelling of real urban layouts is still an open challenge for porosity models in differential form integral porosity ip models guinot et al 2017 sanders et al 2008 were introduced with the specific aim of accounting for the flow field variability within the urban fabric yet for how they are constructed ip models suffer a marked sensitivity to the mesh design guinot 2017a kim et al 2015 recently varra et al 2020 argued that resorting to the differential approach does not prevent a model to supply meaningful information at the scale comparable to those of buildings meters or tens of meters of course porosity fields have to reflect the actual spatial variability of blocking features within the urban fabric with this in mind in this work we present a method to infer the porosity parameters needed by the dual porosity model of ferrari et al 2019 and viero 2019 automatically for real and complex urban areas making use of geometrical information only this should assure model robustness and limit the need for successive model calibration special care is devoted to the estimation of the conveyance porosity for multiple reasons unlike in the integral porosity models in which it is defined at the cell sides conveyance porosity is here defined at the cell level i e it has to reflect the connectivity properties of the urban medium within the entire cell guinot 2017a viero 2019 this is both an opportunity and a challenge the cell based spatially averaged description of the spatial connectivity and of preferential flow directions is the main ingredient assuring robust and mesh independent estimates yet conveyance porosity is actually direction dependent thus entailing the need of recognising effective principal components i e minimum and maximum conveyances along with the associated directions by only analysing the spatial distribution of building footprints importantly the geometrically based estimates must be effective in representing the real hydraulic behaviour of obstacles and preferential pathways within the cell thus the method here presented computes the direction dependent conveyance porosity its principal components and the associated directions as well as storage porosity from the building footprints of a given urban area on a cell by cell basis a graphical method based on the use of roseplots is also proposed to preliminary check the effectiveness of the conveyance porosity estimates the paper is organized as follows the key aspects of the dual porosity formulation in differential form ferrari et al 2019 viero 2019 together with the main features of the 2d accelerated shallow water model adopted in the work are recalled in sec 2 the method to automatically extract the porosity parameters from building footprints is described in sec 3 and made available in a permanent repository see appendix a the method is then tested by simulating floods in complex urban areas sec 4 the discussion on the proposed procedure and some concluding remarks are finally outlined in sec 5 2 material and methods 2 1 the dual porosity model in differential form in the framework of urban flood modelling based on the shallow water equations swes with porosity the formulation recently presented in ferrari et al 2019 and viero 2019 describes the effects exerted by buildings and obstacles by adopting an isotropic storage porosity and an anisotropic conveyance porosity both defined at the cell level the isotropic porosity ϕ accounts for the storage reduction due to the presence of buildings it is evaluated for each computational cell as the ratio between the area free of obstacles and the total area fig 1 a as in single porosity sp and integral porosity ip models guinot and soares frazão 2006 sanders et al 2008 on the other hand the reduced conveyance the alteration in the flow direction and the presence of preferential flow pathways related to the alignment of buildings and obstacles are accounted for by introducing in the momentum equations a direction dependent conveyance porosity in tensor form ferrari et al 2019 viero 2019 viero and valipour 2017 this conveyance porosity which reflects the spatial distribution of obstacles and preferential pathways within cell and not only at cell edges is the genuine novelty of the approach proposed by ferrari et al 2019 and viero 2019 in previous sp models in fact preferential flow directions have been taken into account by introducing directional drag terms that essentially rely on model calibration velickovic et al 2017 thus limiting the predictive power of the model in the ip model sanders et al 2008 and in the dual ip model as well guinot et al 2017 conveyance porosity is locally defined at the cell sides thus making these models unusually sensitive to the mesh design guinot 2017a in a one dimensional 1d framework the conveyance porosity ψ is analogous to the width ratio of a channel contraction defina and viero 2010 i e it is evaluated as the ratio between the width at the narrowest cross section and the total width in a two dimensional 2d framework fig 1b the conveyance porosity assumes different values for different flow directions it is then evaluated along the principal directions of maximum l and minimum t conveyance resulting in the longitudinal ψl and transverse ψt conveyance parameters which are supposed to be mutually orthogonal finally the rotation angle between the l t frame and the x y model frame is expressed by the parameter α fig 1b this dual porosity approach has been implemented in two different 2d hydrodynamic models ferrari et al 2019 described the implementation of the subgrid scheme in parflood a gpu enhanced finite volume model on cartesian and multi resolution grids vacondio et al 2017 2014 viero 2019 described its implementation in 2def a finite element mixed eulerian lagrangian model on staggered unstructured meshes d alpaos et al 2007 defina 2000 viero et al 2014 2013 in the parflood and 2def models the implementation of the dual porosity model was slightly different viero 2019 used the conveyance porosity in tensor form to express both acceleration terms and friction losses ferrari et al 2019 used the conveyance porosity for friction losses and kept the storage porosity for acceleration terms to retain the general structure of classical finite volume schemes to sum up the implementation of the dual porosity scheme is more rigorous in viero 2019 but the 2def model is neither suitable to deal with shock waves nor with rapidly varying flows on the other hand although accounting for anisotropic effects only through friction losses the porous version of parflood described in ferrari et al 2019 is shock capturing and suitable for subcritical supercritical and rapidly varying flows nevertheless both the schemes were shown to provide reasonably good results in their respective field of applications in the present work the effectiveness of the porosity parameters estimated from building footprints with the method described in the following sec 3 is tested using the model by ferrari et al 2019 whose main features are briefly recalled in the following section 2 2 the porous version of the parflood numerical model in the parflood model according to ferrari et al 2019 the four parameters ϕ ψl ψt and α are introduced in the system of 2d swes written in integral form toro 2001 1 d dt a u da c h n d c a s 0 s f s p d a where a and c are the area and the boundary of the integration element respectively n is the outward unit vector normal to c the vector of the conserved variables u and the tensor of fluxes in the x and y directions h f g are defined as 2 u η u h v h f uh u 2 h 1 2 g η 2 2 η z u v h g vh u v h v 2 h 1 2 g η 2 2 η z with h the water depth η the water surface elevation z the bottom elevation g the gravitational acceleration u and v the velocity components in the x and y directions respectively the bed slope source term s 0 and the porosity related non conservative product s p are defined as 3 s 0 0 g η z x g η z y s p h ϕ u ϕ x v ϕ y uh ϕ u ϕ x v ϕ y vh ϕ u ϕ x v ϕ y finally the friction source term s f is obtained by first projecting the flow velocity on the l t frame and then projecting friction components back to the x y frame thus accounting for anisotropic conveyance porosity as follows ferrari et al 2019 4 s f 0 g h n 2 u el u el 2 u

t are the effective velocity components along the l and t directions respectively as pointed out in ferrari et al 2019 the formulation guarantees the well balancing between fluxes and source terms liang and borthwick 2009 and preserves the c property also in presence of wet dry fronts regardless the slope source term discretization liang and marche 2009 the numerical fluxes in eq 2 are computed at the cell interfaces adopting the hllc approximate riemann solver toro 2001 a robust treatment of non physical velocities which may develop at wet dry fronts is ensured with a zero mass error by adopting the flux correction of kurganov and petrova 2007 the numerical scheme achieves both first and second order of accuracy this last approximation in space is ensured by reconstructing the conserved variables at the cell edges by means of the linear monotone upwind schemes for scalar conservation laws muscl with minmod limiter toro 1999 the conserved variables are updated at each time step according to the second order runge kutta method providing a second order accuracy in time the set of partial differential equations can be solved on two different structured grids both cartesian vacondio et al 2014 and multi resolution block uniform quadtree buq vacondio et al 2017 given that the dual porosity approach is not over sensitive to the mesh design it can be safely implemented on structured grids which cannot be adapted to meet the strict requirements of proper mesh design needed by e g ip models guinot 2017a with reference to the implementation technique the explicit finite volume scheme is written in cuda c architecture that exploits parallel computation offered by nvidiatm graphic processing units gpus thus significantly reducing the computational time 3 a procedure to infer porosity parameters from building footprints 3 1 basic principles in simulating urban floods with porosity models the adoption of coarse grids entails an unavoidable loss of detail in the representation of the flow field within a urban area with respect to the use of fine grids that resolve buildings explicitly this loss of detail becomes substantial when models are used with uniform porosity distributions within an entire urban district which is the common practice for porosity models in differential form e g cea and vázquez cendón 2010 guinot 2012 guinot and soares frazão 2006 soares frazao et al 2008 to find a reasonable trade off between computational effort and spatial resolution of the flow field description first the grid resolution has to be adequate to the length scale of the problem i e comparable to the width of streets and buildings and second the porosity parameters must reflect the spatial distribution of obstacles and preferential pathways within the urban fabric while the first requirement is relatively easy to meet the second one is actually an open challenge this last issue is here addressed in the framework of the dual porosity model in differential form described in sec 2 1 the four porosity parameters required by the model are supposed to vary inside the built up area so as to account for the spatial distribution of obstacles and preferential flow paths within the urban area accordingly porosity parameters are estimated on a genuine cell by cell basis this is expected to improve the description of the effects exerted by buildings on the flow field both close to and inside the urban area at a spatial scale comparable to that of the relatively coarse grid the same basic idea has been theoretically supported by varra et al 2020 and has been tested by soares frazão et al 2018 in the framework of sp porosity models plus drag terms in tensor form highlighting the benefits of accounting for distributed porosity based on the actual layout of buildings and streets the present method for estimating porosity distributions in real urbanized areas is designed to fulfil some basic principles i the spatial distribution of the porosity parameters should only rely on geometrical information so as to reduce the successive need of model calibration arrault et al 2016 ii the estimation of porosity parameters should be inferred automatically so as to allow straightforward large scale model applications and iii the procedure should be intuitive and controlled by few parameters of clear physical meaning so as to promote easy and trustful use by practitioners 3 2 spatially distributed porosity fields from urban geometry given a relatively coarse computational grid covering a built up area the porosity parameters are evaluated by applying the procedure described in the following to each computational cell in extracting the porosity parameters from geometrical information the computation of the storage porosity ϕ is straightforward fig 1a whereas estimating conveyance porosity effectively is far more complicated as it requires the joint estimation of the principal components and of the associated angles indeed the conveyance porosity is direction dependent and the angles that define the principal directions are not known a priori in general for a hypothetical mean flow direction at an angle αk to the x axis double headed arrow in fig 2 the conveyance porosity ψ αk should be estimated as the width ratio of the narrowest cross section in analogy to the definition of fig 1b then considering that the function ψ αk is periodic with period π i e ψ αk ψ αk π the function ψ αk should be characterized for discrete values of αk in the range 0 π finally once known the behaviour of ψ αk a proper criterion should allow identifying the principal components of the conveyance porosity ψl and ψt along with the angle α that identifies the direction of maximum conveyance ψl fig 1b the proposed approach is a step forward with respect to bruwier et al 2017 who determined the conveyance porosities by evaluating the minimum free length across a coarse cell only in the x and y directions the procedure for the computation of the conveyance porosity principal components is implemented in two different versions denoted as segment based and strip based methods as described in the following the code implemented in fortran language is made available as supplementary material see appendix a 3 2 1 anisotropic conveyance porosity segment based method the first version of the algorithm that computes the porosity parameters is denoted as segment based method fig 3 a it has to be applied to each cell of the computational grid and consists in the following steps 1 identify the buildings and obstacles whose footprint intersects the cell 2 compute the storage porosity ϕ which is the complement to unity of the fraction of cell area occupied by buildings fig 1a using any polygons intersection routine 3 span the sampling directions αk in the interval 0 π as in fig 2 given a number of directions to be considered nα the angular spacing in degrees is δα 180 nα the k th sampling direction is αk k 1 δα with k 1 nα a recommended value for δα is 1 4 segment sampling the cell is temporarily rotated by αk and sampled by considering nsg equispaced segments denoted with index i with spacing dsg l nsg fig 3a 5 evaluate the free length for each of the nsg segments for each segment i once detected the nj parts that overlap the building footprints l 1 and l 2 in fig 3a the total free length is computed as l i free l j 1 n j l j 6 evaluate the conveyance porosity in the αk direction as the ratio of minimum free length to segment length ψ α k min i l i free l this is a simple estimate of the width ratio of the narrowest cross section for the given mean flow direction αk 7 find the angle α for which the reciprocally orthogonal principal components of the conveyance porosity ψl and ψt are closest to the maximum and minimum values among the nα values of the function ψ αk respectively the goal is achieved by finding αk such that the product p ψ ψ α k 1 ψ α k π 2 is maximum and setting α αk indeed pψ attains a maximum when ψ is large along αk and small in the orthogonal direction αk π 2 see fig 4 f for an example 8 determine ψl and ψt considering that the minimum and maximum values of ψ αk are not always orthogonal to each other a trade off is needed the l direction should coincide with that of maximum conveyance α to preserve the flux alignment in preferential pathways e g streets and ψt should be taken as the minimum value of conveyance to represent blocking features correctly accordingly the conveyance parameters are assumed as ψl ψ α and ψt min ψ αk 3 2 2 anisotropic conveyance porosity strip based method the second version of the algorithm is denoted as strip based method fig 3b only points 4 and 5 differ from the segment based method described above 4 strip slicing the cell is temporarily rotated by αk and sliced in nst strips denoted with index i each strip has width dst l nst fig 3b in which nst 3 and dst l 3 5 evaluate the free length for each of the nst strips for each i th strip once found the nj projections on the strip axis of each part of building that overlaps the strip l 1 and l 2 in fig 3b the total length of the strip axis free of any building projection is evaluated as l i free l j 1 n j l j 3 2 3 graphical representation of the conveyance porosity to judge the strengths and weaknesses of the above methods the first step consists in visualizing the algorithm results in terms of direction dependent conveyance porosity ψ αk to reach the goal in the figures hereinafter and in the supplementary data see appendix a the coarse grid is superposed to the building footprints and for each cell the roseplot of ψ αk is plotted considering that ψ αk ranges in the interval 0 1 for each of the nα sampling directions the coordinates of the roseplot line vertexes xrp yrp are obtained as 5 x rp x c 0 4 l ψ α k cos α k y rp y c 0 4 l ψ α k sin α k where xc yc is the cell center and 0 4 is a coefficient that determines the size of the roseplot with respect to the grid size l for each cell two diametral segments are plotted that denote the l blue and t red directions of maximum and minimum conveyance as determined according to points 7 and 8 in sec 3 2 1 3 3 considerations on the segment based and strip based methods this section aims at discussing the pros and cons of the two methods previously described the segment based method is the plainest way to face the problem of conveyance porosity evaluation but it is subject to some limitations a very small segment spacing dsg is required to sample the cell in order to capture the possible presence of linear blocking features as thin walls hodges 2015 this entails a large number of segments to be analyzed which requires a significant computational effort even if it is performed only once before running the simulation most importantly the free length of each segment l i free is estimated regardless of what happens upstream and downstream of the segment itself seldom leading to inconsistencies this is shown with some examples in fig 4 a slender building or a linear blocking feature is sampled through segments a and strips d for the hypothetical flow direction αk 90 the roseplots of ψ αk are obtained by analyzing all directions in the range 0 π panels c and f show the trend of ψ αk green lines which is then translated by π 2 grey lines to obtain its complement to one grey dashed line and in turn the product pψ αk black dotted line the longitudinal l direction blue lines in b c e f is the one that maximizes the product pψ and the transverse t direction red lines in b c e f is assumed as orthogonal to l this is the criterion chosen to determine the most reliable principal components for conveyance ψ according to point 7 in sec 3 2 1 in fig 4 while the segment based method a is unable to recognize the whole width of the obstacle the green segments are far shorter than the total building width the strip based method succeeds since the dark green portion of the strip in d is as wide as the obstacle the segment derived roseplot in b shows similar values of ψ αk in the north south and in the east west directions as a consequence the criterion based on the product pψ is unable to recognize orthogonal principal directions of maximum and minimum conveyance properly c the strip based roseplot e shows a significantly lower conveyance in the north south direction and more realistic results also for the entire range of directions this allows detecting the principal directions correctly the comparison of panels c and f in fig 4 suggests that the criterion to determine the principal components described at point 7 in sec 3 2 1 works well when ψ αk shows nearly orthogonal maxima and minima otherwise it fails in determining the direction of minimum conveyance but not the value of minimum conveyance ψt which is chosen regardless of the actual value of ψ in the t direction according to point 8 in sec 3 2 1 in fig 5 the segment and strip based methods are applied to the checkerboard building arrangement of the toce experiment testa et al 2007 to obtain accurate results in the same urban layout using a coarse grid ferrari et al 2019 highlighted the need of using lower values of conveyance porosity than the free length computed for a single row of buildings indeed the staggered arrangement of buildings imposes severe successive deviations to the flow thus increasing the resistances with respect to the case of aligned buildings for this reason the conveyance porosity computed accounting for a single row of buildings is far greater than the effective one although the segment based method is expected to work properly when the grid size is comparable to or smaller than the size of buildings when using coarser grids as in fig 5a the segment based sampling is unable to capture the tortuosity of floodwater pathways within the cell thus overestimating the real conveyance the strip based method is expected to perform similarly well to the segment based method for finer grids and significantly better in case of coarser grids as in the case of fig 5c in the considered direction the strip based estimate of conveyance porosity accounts for the staggered arrangement of buildings i e for the tortuosity of pathways within the cell the obtained value corresponds to the theoretical one ψ 8 0 2 buildings are 0 15 m wide and l 1 7 m in this case to sum up the strip based method improves the estimation of the conveyance porosity by considering all the blocking features that overlap a strip orthogonal to the assumed flow direction by increasing the strip width information is added that concerns the presence of obstacles both upstream and downstream accordingly a tortuous path is given a lower conveyance porosity than a straight path it is interesting to note that the strip based method reduces to the segment based method in the limit dst 0 with dst the strip width thus implying that the segment based method is actually a special case of the more general strip based method in view of giving some operating instructions on the application of the strip based method the strip width has to be chosen as large as possible i e dst l in order to recognize the real direction of preferential pathways e g streets correctly and also to reflect the tortuosity of floodwater pathways within each single cell on the other hand when very coarse grids are used to model dense urban layouts with irregularly arranged obstacles the adoption of excessively wide strips may result in a significant underestimation of the conveyance porosity simply speaking one can obtain ψl ψt 0 meaning that the flow is inhibited in all directions also when obstacle interspaces are well interconnected accordingly to reflect the connectivity of the urban medium yet avoiding misrepresentations the strip width should be taken larger than the typical length scale of the urban layout although being careful of not exceeding it too much finally focusing on the computational efforts required by the two methods the strip based method is generally faster as the number of strips nst is typically much smaller than the number of segments nsg implying that the number of line polygon intersections to be computed is largely lower for the strip based method nonetheless it is worth noting that the porosity parameters are evaluated for each cell of the coarse grid only once in a pre processing step the computation of the spatially distributed porosity parameters for the finest meshes of the test cases shown in sec 4 is performed in a few minutes and does not affect the simulation runtime the resulting parameters are kept constant during the simulation thus assuming that both storage and conveyance porosities are not depth dependent bruwier et al 2017 guinot et al 2018 li and hodges 2019 özgen et al 2016 2015 rong et al 2020 4 results the segment and strip based methods presented in sec 3 are tested by simulating the flooding in a laboratory experiment the toce case study testa et al 2007 and in two complex urban districts the laboratory experiment with staggered obstacles is chosen because previous applications of the porosity model with a uniform porosity distribution required particular values of porosity parameters a need that makes not obvious the successful application of the present algorithm then since the main novelty of this work is to allow computing the porosity parameters in real urban layouts two districts in northern italy are chosen as benchmarks which are representative of complex urban fabrics with irregular shaped buildings and streets courtyards gardens walls etc in all the tests the spatial distribution of the four porosity parameters is extracted geometrically using the two above methods and the parflood model is used to solve the porous 2d swes with anisotropic friction see sec 2 2 the model results are compared against reference refined solutions obtained by solving the classical 2d swes again with the parflood model on fine grids in which buildings and obstacles are explicitly resolved building hole method schubert and sanders 2012 all the simulations were run on a nvidia tesla p100 gpu the model sensitivity to the bottom roughness and to the inflow boundary conditions was already addressed in ferrari et al 2019 hence in this work only the sensitivity of the porosity model to the mesh size and to the parameters controlling the computation of conveyance is tested it is well known that the size of the coarse grid cells affects the accuracy of the numerical solution in terms of flow depth and velocity sanders and schubert 2019 more importantly in this case the porosity fields are expected to change dramatically with the resolution of the coarse grid this is because the number and the position of buildings and obstacles within a cell strongly depend on its size and location the goal is to demonstrate that the change of grid resolution and the contextual change in the porosity fields lead to similar results and that these results tend towards the reference solution for increasing grid resolutions as a final note the footprints of buildings and walls are superposed to all the figures referring to porous results for facilitating the comparison even if they are not explicitly resolved in the computation 4 1 the toce experimental case study before proceeding with the application to realistic urban layouts and to the sensitivity analysis the two methods are firstly compared considering the toce river experiment eu impact project testa et al 2007 the benchmark is a physical model in scale 1 100 which reproduces the flooding in the toce valley northern italy a checkerboard building layout with 18 square concrete building blocks of 15 cm side length is used to simulate the presence of a urban environment such a building arrangement has already been discussed in sec 3 3 and in fig 5 the porosity formulation recalled in sec 2 2 was already tested against this experimental benchmark using a uniform distribution of porosity parameters ferrari et al 2019 but the successful application of the model required a particular value of conveyance porosity obtained by collapsing two consecutive rows of buildings hence it is not obvious that the algorithm for porosity computation is able to extract effective porosity distributions for the same schematic but not trivial building layout in the simulations the initially dry domain is flooded by a 60 s long high inflow discharge entering the river testa et al 2007 and a free outflow condition is specified at the end of the valley reach the domain is characterized by a manning roughness coefficient equal to n 0 0162 m 1 3 s testa et al 2007 in the reference solution buildings are explicitly resolved on a cartesian grid with square cells of size δx 1 cm the segment and strip based methods are used for the porous configuration with δx 5 cm conveyance porosity is computed considering either a segment spacing dsg 5 mm or a strip width dst l 5 cm the water depths and velocities provided by the different methods are compared in fig 6 water depth and fig 7 velocity at time t 14 s the comparison shows that both the segment and strip based methods allow reproducing the hydraulic jump that forms just upstream the obstacles and the main flow features correctly in particular the velocity maps shown in fig 7 highlight that the adoption of spatial distributed porosity fields allows describing the flow field variability within the urban area and not only the effect of obstacles on the external flow field as in uniform porosity applications ferrari et al 2019 fig 8 compares the water level time series recorded at gauge locations alcrudo et al 2002 testa et al 2007 with those simulated by explicitly resolving the buildings and with the porosity parameters obtained with the strip and segment based methods all the approaches provide similar results and show a generally good agreement with the measured values importantly the use of spatially distributed porosity fields improves the model results at the internal points p5 and p6 with respect to the uniform porosity parameters assumed in ferrari et al 2019 the segment and strip based methods provide very similar results in this case this is expected see sec 3 3 considering that the resolution of the coarse grid 5 cm is smaller than the geometrical length scale of the problem buildings size is 15 15 cm as discussed in sec 3 3 and in agreement with the schematic examples of figs 4 and 5 the strip based method tends to provide lower values for ψt than the segment based method resulting in slightly more dissipative scenarios this is confirmed by the slightly larger water depths obtained with the strip based method 4 2 the spinea district case study the first urban layout here analyzed is inspired by a district in the town of spinea in northern italy fig 9 this middle density area presents different shaped buildings which are separated one another by small walls surrounded by gardens and courtyards which act as temporally storage areas during flooding viero 2019 in the simulations the domain is characterized by a bottom slope of 0 09 southward and a manning roughness coefficient n 0 029 m 1 3 s the domain is initially dry in the central 50 m of the northern edge an inflow boundary condition is prescribed in the form of a 2 hours gamma distributed flood wave fig 10 with a peak value of about 600 m3 s free outflow is assumed at the southern edge the computational domain is discretized using a cartesian grid with square cells of size δx 0 5 m for the refined solution and δx 2 5 10 20 and 50 m for the porous simulations the porous tests adopt the porosity fields resulting from both the segment and strip based methods for this latter case different strip widths are considered the main features of the simulations are reported in table 1 the model results at the arrival of the flood peak 0 6 h are shown in fig 11 water depths and fig 12 velocity fields for the reference simulation and for the porous applications with δx 5 m and 20 m looking at the maps as a whole it emerges that the adoption of spatially distributed porosity parameters allows capturing the most relevant features of flooding both outside and inside the urbanized area in terms of water depths fig 11 the porosity schemes capture the rise of the water depths north of the built up area orange red zone and the downstream drop purple blue zone south east with a slight loss of accuracy associated to grid coarsening passing from id 4 to id 10 or equivalently from id 5 to id 13 in terms of velocity fields fig 12 the porosity schemes well capture the high velocity zone at the northern edge orange red the middle one at west green and the low one at south east purple blue differences with the reference solution can be found essentially in terms of velocity in external areas at the beginning or end of streets due to the presence of singularities that only a resolved scheme on a fine mesh can capture properly the comparison of large scale maps shows that the porosity fields provided by the segment and by the strip based methods as for example test id 4 or id 10 segments against test id 5 or id 13 strips produce negligible differences in the simulated flow fields for grid resolutions of 5 and 20 m obviously the results depend on the grid resolution the simulations with δx 5 m id 4 id 5 agree with the reference solution id 1 better than the ones with δx 20 m id 10 id 13 the choice of a proper grid resolution is thus related to the flow field definition needed by the modeler and not to specific requirements of the porosity approach besides the large scale analysis of the flow field around the built up area interesting information can be gained by looking at the inner velocity fields fig 13 as mentioned at the beginning of sec 3 1 the use of porosity models entails an unavoidable loss of details in the flow field within the urban area essentially due to the adoption of coarse meshes in which buildings are not resolved explicitly nonetheless the zoom view of fig 13 shows that the use of spatially distributed porosity fields evaluated with the methods of sec 3 2 allows reproducing the flow concentration along the main streets expectedly the velocity values obtained in the reference solution id 1 with δx 0 5 m cannot be captured accurately with grids that are at least one order of magnitude coarser δx 5 m the comparison of id 10 and id 13 maps in fig 13 shows that for coarser grids the strip based method describes the blocking effects exerted by buildings and garden walls better than the segment based method indeed in the western part of the built up area flow velocity is lower in id 13 purple colors than in id 10 blue colors for the same time instant fig 14 compares the total depth indicator which accounts for simultaneous water depth and velocity representing the water depth at rest d whose static force is equivalent to the total force of the flow aureli et al 2008 ferrari et al 2019 according to 6 d h 1 2 f where h represents the water depth and f the froude number the partition showed in the low left panel of fig 14 allows for the definition of the following classes low 0 d 0 5 m medium 0 5 d 1 m high 1 d 1 5 m and very high d 1 5 m focusing on the effects exerted by the built up area on the neighbouring ones fig 14 highlights that the porosity results well match the reference one moreover the porous scenarios capture the upper zone with high hazard level inside the urban patch whereas they slightly overestimate the medium rank in the middle of the urban area a more systematic analysis of the model performance for all the simulations run is carried out by quantifying the l 2 error norm for the maximum water depth and the maximum velocity according to 7 l 2 f 1 n i 1 n f por i f re f i 2 where n denotes the number of computational cells f is the variable of interest maximum water depth hmax or velocity magnitude umax por and ref subscripts identify the porous and reference solutions respectively the analysis of error norms reported in table 1 gives further insights the capability of both the segment and strip based methods in extracting reliable porosity parameters is confirmed by the relatively small values assumed by the error norms importantly smaller error norms are obtained by increasing the grid resolution indicating that the coarse solutions tend to the reference solution the error norms increase significantly when passing from δx 20 m to δx 50 m confirming the importance of choosing the grid size carefully on the base of the length scale of the problem in this case δx 50 m denotes a cell size two order of magnitude larger than the reference one and five times larger than the typical street width which is about 10 m in this test fig 9 for a given grid resolution the errors associated to the different methods segments or strips are similar to each other for finer grids whereas the strip based method performs slightly better in the case of coarser grids i e in line with the reasoning reported in sec 3 3 finally it is relevant to notice the high reduction of the runtimes that can be achieved in the porous simulations as an example the cases id 2 and id 3 which adopt the finest mesh here used for the porous simulations δx 2 m run about 48 times faster than the simulation with resolved buildings id 1 119 5 2 5 this gap enlarges up to two order of magnitude when using coarser meshes e g 119 5 0 03 4 3 the palmanova town case study the third model application deals with the modelling of a flood wave in a radial city as that of palmanova northern italy in which buildings and streets converge to a central hexagon square fig 15 the goal is validating the effectiveness of the spatial distribution of porosity parameters provided by the algorithms of sec 3 2 also in a complex urban area characterized by a non conventional building alignment the domain which is shown in fig 16 is given a southward bottom slope of 0 08 in the simulations a manning roughness coefficient n 0 029 m 1 3s is assumed as in the previous test the initially dry domain is flooded by the 2 h long gamma distributed flood wave shown in fig 10 the upstream inflow boundary condition is prescribed in the central 50 m of the northern edge of the domain free outflow is assumed at the southern edge a cartesian grid with square cells of size δx 0 4 m is used to discretize the domain for the reference solution with resolved buildings and δx 2 5 10 and 20 m for the porous simulations again the porous tests adopt the porosity fields resulting from both the segment and strip based methods and for this latter case different strip widths are considered the main features of the simulations are reported in table 2 analogously to the previous test the model results at the arrival of the flood peak 0 6 h are shown in fig 17 water depths and fig 18 velocity fields for the reference simulation and for the porous applications with δx 5 m and 20 m compared with the reference solution id 1 the anisotropic porous solutions on the δx 5 m grid id 4 and id 5 well capture the deeper water depths at the entrance of the urban area yellow orange values the flooding characteristics in the north part of the built up zone green values and the low depth zone at south purple values moreover also for this urban layout the segment and strip based methods show minimal differences with δx 5 m and 20 m for both the methods the use of a coarser mesh size δx 20 m in id 8 and id 10 entails an excessive increment of the water depth inside the urban area norther part and for this reason it seems less adequate to model this scenario accurately a look at the velocity fields in fig 18 confirms that the results with δx 5 m id 4 and id 5 match the reference solution id 1 well the high flow velocity zone in the north part of the domain orange red values and the medium one in the upstream semicircle green zone is captured quite accurately the δx 20 m grid confirms a loss of accuracy importantly the detailed view in fig 19 reveals that the porous modelling allows for partially reproducing the flow field variability within the built up area id 4 and id 5 although only the high resolution reference solution id 1 succeeds in modelling the flow field among small pathways also the coarse grid allows identifying some preferential flow directions with pathways characterized by larger flow velocities for the same time instant fig 20 compares the total depth indicator of eq 6 obtained from the different scenarios the use of δx 5 m grid resolution allows capturing the overall hazard rank regardless of the method used to extract the porosity fields implying that such a grid size is suitable given the typical length scale of the problem with the δx 20 m grid the segment based method leads to an overestimation of the high hazard level in the north whereas the strip based method still provides accurate results confirming that the strip based method performs better on coarse grids with the aim of analyzing the model results quantitatively the l2 error norms are evaluated according to eq 7 for both the maximum water depth and velocity magnitude table 2 the analysis leads to the same conclusions as in the spinea test model errors do not vary with the chosen algorithm segment or strip based significantly for lower mesh sizes whereas the strip based method is better suited for coarser grids moreover when the mesh size is relatively large e g δx 20 m the errors increase significantly essentially for the loss of details in describing the flow field within the built up area finally the analysis of the runtimes reported in table 2 further confirms the great advantage of the porous approach with respect to the explicit solution of buildings for example looking at cases id 2 and id 3 that still adopt a relatively fine grid δx 2 m the computational burden is reduced up to 90 times if compared with the resolved simulation 250 56 2 78 5 discussion and conclusions the present work dealt with a method to extract the spatial distribution of porosity parameters from building and obstacle footprints to be used in the dual porosity model proposed by viero 2019 and by ferrari et al 2019 a fortran implementation of the algorithm is available in a permanent repository for free download and use detailed information in appendix a the key feature of the proposed method is the computation of the direction dependent conveyance porosity which is performed by analysing the connectivity and the presence of preferential pathways within the cell and not only at cell edges as in integral porosity models guinot et al 2017 sanders et al 2008 the effectiveness of the implemented method was assessed first by visual inspection superposing the roseplots of conveyance porosity to the building footprints to check the algorithm ability in detecting obstructions and preferential pathways correctly then the porosity fields provided by the algorithm were used to simulate the flooding of experimental and realistic urban layouts with the porous version of the parflood model the results were found to compare well with the reference solutions obtained using refined grids with explicitly resolved buildings the proposed method proved able to account for the presence of blocking features which are known to affect the flow field substantially hodges 2015 li and hodges 2019 as well as for the role of large streets as preferential pathways and global flow pattern separators chen et al 2018 the model application to complex case studies suggests that the effects of restrictions are fairly reproduced despite they are modelled through a modification of friction resistance only li and hodges 2020 notwithstanding the considerable variability of porosity fields with the grid resolution the results in terms of flow field characteristics water depths and velocities were limited to the expected loss of accuracy associated with grid coarsening confirming the substantial independence of the porosity approach to the computational grid it s worth stressing that the proposed method was conceived in the framework of large scale subgrid modelling of major flooding events in urbanized areas specific attention was paid to reproduce the effects exerted by the main obstacles that characterize complex urban layouts urban micro features which can significantly influence the simulated inundation extent and depth mignot et al 2013 wang et al 2018 yu and lane 2011 were not considered for now as a final note viero 2019 warned that assuming the existence of two reciprocally orthogonal principal directions for the conveyance porosity is likely too simplistic to capture the complexity of real urban settlements under general conditions the application of the methods presented above shows that the cell conveyance is well represented by the tensor formulation with two reciprocally orthogonal principal directions in particular when it is mainly determined by the presence of a single dominant obstacle on the contrary in the presence of multiple either aligned or staggered obstacles within a cell the conveyance function ψ α presents multiple maxima and minima for example see the three local maxima in the green roseplot of fig 5d which reveal the presence of multiple preferential pathways along different directions in such cases the tensor formulation proposed by viero 2019 and ferrari et al 2019 cannot reproduce the peculiar behaviours of ψ α properly in assessing the case of aligned buildings velickovic et al 2017 proposed to use drag terms along with suitable amplification coefficients depending on the flow direction a solution then

code contains some optimizations that allow for a fast porosity computation first the polygons identifying the building footprints are ordered according to the x coordinate then for each grid cell the code identifies the potentially overlapping polygons and processes only these ones in order to compute the storage and the conveyance porosity the algorithm performs the operations described in sec 3 2 some additional details concerning the point n 5 of the algorithm are given herein with reference to the segment based method sec 3 2 1 the code performs the following operations 5a search all the intersection points between the sampling segment and the sides of the obstacle footprints if no intersections are found check if the whole segment is contained within any polygon this occurs if the segment center falls within at least one polygon if so the free length is zero otherwise the algorithm continues as follows 5b order the intersection points based on the distance from the first endpoint of the sampling segment 5c check if each part of the sampling segment between two consecutive intersection points is contained within a polygon i e the segment part overlaps a building

5271,in the framework of porosity models for large scale urban floods this work presents a method to compute the spatial distribution of the porosity parameters of complex urban areas by analyzing the footprints of buildings and obstacles precisely an algorithm is described that estimates the four parameters required by the differential dual porosity formulation we recently presented in this formulation beside the common isotropic porosity accounting for the reduced storage volume due to buildings a cell based conveyance porosity is introduced in the momentum equations in tensor form to model anisotropic resistances and alterations in the flow direction due to presence of preferential pathways such as streets a cell averaged description of the spatial connectivity in the urban medium and of the preferential flow directions is the main ingredient for robust and mesh independent estimates to achieve this goal the algorithm here presented automatically extracts the spatially distributed porosity fields of urban layouts relying only on geometrical information thus avoiding additional calibration effort the proposed method is described with the aid of schematic applications and then tested by simulating the flooding of complex urban areas using structured cartesian grids a fortran implementation of the algorithm is made available for free download and use keywords urban flood porosity model conveyance porosity porous shallow water equations spatially distributed porosity field anisotropic friction structured grid 1 introduction urban flooding is recognised as a global challenge exacerbated by the growth of megacities in flood prone areas by anthropogenic modifications of landscapes and by climate change as well arnell and gosling 2016 jongman et al 2012 tanoue et al 2016 viero et al 2019 the adoption of structural measures and complementary strategies to reduce the effects of floods kundzewicz et al 2018 mel et al 2020 the achievement of increased resilience ferrari et al 2020a mcclymont et al 2020 and effective adaptation jongman 2018 muis et al 2015 radhakrishnan et al 2018 all rely on the knowledge of the processes involved the need of assessing flood hazard accurately entails the need of suitable modelling tools for large scale urban floods sanders 2017 sanders and schubert 2019 vacondio et al 2016 wing et al 2018 in this view subgrid porosity models for urban floods reproduce the effects of fine scale topography at a relatively coarse resolution allowing physics based large scale applications with limited need of computational resources this kind of models has been the subject of ongoing research and of numerous applications braschi and gallati 1989 bruwier et al 2017 chen et al 2012a b costabile et al 2020 cozzolino et al 2018 defina 2000 defina et al 1994 ferrari et al 2020b 2017 guinot 2012 guinot et al 2017 özgen et al 2016 sanders et al 2008 varra et al 2020 yu and lane 2011 2006 here we draw the reader s attention to the dual porosity model in differential form recently proposed by viero 2019 and ferrari et al 2019 in which an isotropic porosity accounts for storage reduction due to the presence of buildings and a direction dependent conveyance porosity is introduced in the momentum equations in tensor form to account for anisotropic resistances exerted by buildings and obstacles and for the presence of preferential pathways both the storage and the conveyance porosities are defined at the cell level the model retains the mesh independence typical of porosity models in differential form and the natural inclusion of anisotropic effects related to alignment of buildings and obstacles typical of integral porosity models guinot et al 2017 sanders et al 2008 in previous contributions the model by ferrari et al 2019 and viero 2019 was only tested using uniform porosity parameters averaged within the urban area and assigned to all the computational cells therein actually to our knowledge porosity models in differential form were all used with uniform porosity so far e g cea and vázquez cendón 2010 guinot 2012 guinot and soares frazão 2006 soares frazao et al 2008 with the only exception of the exploratory study by soares frazão et al 2018 the use of uniform porosity parameters allows verifying the model skills in terms of global resistance exerted by a patch of urbanized area on the surrounding flow yet it offers no chance of describing the spatial variability of the flow field within the urban area moreover it has to be admitted that for increasingly larger urban areas uniform porosity parameters become as difficult to estimate as meaningless from a physical point of view that is to say the modelling of real urban layouts is still an open challenge for porosity models in differential form integral porosity ip models guinot et al 2017 sanders et al 2008 were introduced with the specific aim of accounting for the flow field variability within the urban fabric yet for how they are constructed ip models suffer a marked sensitivity to the mesh design guinot 2017a kim et al 2015 recently varra et al 2020 argued that resorting to the differential approach does not prevent a model to supply meaningful information at the scale comparable to those of buildings meters or tens of meters of course porosity fields have to reflect the actual spatial variability of blocking features within the urban fabric with this in mind in this work we present a method to infer the porosity parameters needed by the dual porosity model of ferrari et al 2019 and viero 2019 automatically for real and complex urban areas making use of geometrical information only this should assure model robustness and limit the need for successive model calibration special care is devoted to the estimation of the conveyance porosity for multiple reasons unlike in the integral porosity models in which it is defined at the cell sides conveyance porosity is here defined at the cell level i e it has to reflect the connectivity properties of the urban medium within the entire cell guinot 2017a viero 2019 this is both an opportunity and a challenge the cell based spatially averaged description of the spatial connectivity and of preferential flow directions is the main ingredient assuring robust and mesh independent estimates yet conveyance porosity is actually direction dependent thus entailing the need of recognising effective principal components i e minimum and maximum conveyances along with the associated directions by only analysing the spatial distribution of building footprints importantly the geometrically based estimates must be effective in representing the real hydraulic behaviour of obstacles and preferential pathways within the cell thus the method here presented computes the direction dependent conveyance porosity its principal components and the associated directions as well as storage porosity from the building footprints of a given urban area on a cell by cell basis a graphical method based on the use of roseplots is also proposed to preliminary check the effectiveness of the conveyance porosity estimates the paper is organized as follows the key aspects of the dual porosity formulation in differential form ferrari et al 2019 viero 2019 together with the main features of the 2d accelerated shallow water model adopted in the work are recalled in sec 2 the method to automatically extract the porosity parameters from building footprints is described in sec 3 and made available in a permanent repository see appendix a the method is then tested by simulating floods in complex urban areas sec 4 the discussion on the proposed procedure and some concluding remarks are finally outlined in sec 5 2 material and methods 2 1 the dual porosity model in differential form in the framework of urban flood modelling based on the shallow water equations swes with porosity the formulation recently presented in ferrari et al 2019 and viero 2019 describes the effects exerted by buildings and obstacles by adopting an isotropic storage porosity and an anisotropic conveyance porosity both defined at the cell level the isotropic porosity ϕ accounts for the storage reduction due to the presence of buildings it is evaluated for each computational cell as the ratio between the area free of obstacles and the total area fig 1 a as in single porosity sp and integral porosity ip models guinot and soares frazão 2006 sanders et al 2008 on the other hand the reduced conveyance the alteration in the flow direction and the presence of preferential flow pathways related to the alignment of buildings and obstacles are accounted for by introducing in the momentum equations a direction dependent conveyance porosity in tensor form ferrari et al 2019 viero 2019 viero and valipour 2017 this conveyance porosity which reflects the spatial distribution of obstacles and preferential pathways within cell and not only at cell edges is the genuine novelty of the approach proposed by ferrari et al 2019 and viero 2019 in previous sp models in fact preferential flow directions have been taken into account by introducing directional drag terms that essentially rely on model calibration velickovic et al 2017 thus limiting the predictive power of the model in the ip model sanders et al 2008 and in the dual ip model as well guinot et al 2017 conveyance porosity is locally defined at the cell sides thus making these models unusually sensitive to the mesh design guinot 2017a in a one dimensional 1d framework the conveyance porosity ψ is analogous to the width ratio of a channel contraction defina and viero 2010 i e it is evaluated as the ratio between the width at the narrowest cross section and the total width in a two dimensional 2d framework fig 1b the conveyance porosity assumes different values for different flow directions it is then evaluated along the principal directions of maximum l and minimum t conveyance resulting in the longitudinal ψl and transverse ψt conveyance parameters which are supposed to be mutually orthogonal finally the rotation angle between the l t frame and the x y model frame is expressed by the parameter α fig 1b this dual porosity approach has been implemented in two different 2d hydrodynamic models ferrari et al 2019 described the implementation of the subgrid scheme in parflood a gpu enhanced finite volume model on cartesian and multi resolution grids vacondio et al 2017 2014 viero 2019 described its implementation in 2def a finite element mixed eulerian lagrangian model on staggered unstructured meshes d alpaos et al 2007 defina 2000 viero et al 2014 2013 in the parflood and 2def models the implementation of the dual porosity model was slightly different viero 2019 used the conveyance porosity in tensor form to express both acceleration terms and friction losses ferrari et al 2019 used the conveyance porosity for friction losses and kept the storage porosity for acceleration terms to retain the general structure of classical finite volume schemes to sum up the implementation of the dual porosity scheme is more rigorous in viero 2019 but the 2def model is neither suitable to deal with shock waves nor with rapidly varying flows on the other hand although accounting for anisotropic effects only through friction losses the porous version of parflood described in ferrari et al 2019 is shock capturing and suitable for subcritical supercritical and rapidly varying flows nevertheless both the schemes were shown to provide reasonably good results in their respective field of applications in the present work the effectiveness of the porosity parameters estimated from building footprints with the method described in the following sec 3 is tested using the model by ferrari et al 2019 whose main features are briefly recalled in the following section 2 2 the porous version of the parflood numerical model in the parflood model according to ferrari et al 2019 the four parameters ϕ ψl ψt and α are introduced in the system of 2d swes written in integral form toro 2001 1 d dt a u da c h n d c a s 0 s f s p d a where a and c are the area and the boundary of the integration element respectively n is the outward unit vector normal to c the vector of the conserved variables u and the tensor of fluxes in the x and y directions h f g are defined as 2 u η u h v h f uh u 2 h 1 2 g η 2 2 η z u v h g vh u v h v 2 h 1 2 g η 2 2 η z with h the water depth η the water surface elevation z the bottom elevation g the gravitational acceleration u and v the velocity components in the x and y directions respectively the bed slope source term s 0 and the porosity related non conservative product s p are defined as 3 s 0 0 g η z x g η z y s p h ϕ u ϕ x v ϕ y uh ϕ u ϕ x v ϕ y vh ϕ u ϕ x v ϕ y finally the friction source term s f is obtained by first projecting the flow velocity on the l t frame and then projecting friction components back to the x y frame thus accounting for anisotropic conveyance porosity as follows ferrari et al 2019 4 s f 0 g h n 2 u el u el 2 u et 2 h 4 3 cos α g h n 2 u et u el 2 u et 2 h 4 3 sin α g h n 2 u el u el 2 u et 2 h 4 3 sin α g h n 2 u et u el 2 u et 2 h 4 3 cos α where n is the manning coefficient u el u l ϕ ψ l and u et u t ϕ ψ t are the effective velocity components along the l and t directions respectively as pointed out in ferrari et al 2019 the formulation guarantees the well balancing between fluxes and source terms liang and borthwick 2009 and preserves the c property also in presence of wet dry fronts regardless the slope source term discretization liang and marche 2009 the numerical fluxes in eq 2 are computed at the cell interfaces adopting the hllc approximate riemann solver toro 2001 a robust treatment of non physical velocities which may develop at wet dry fronts is ensured with a zero mass error by adopting the flux correction of kurganov and petrova 2007 the numerical scheme achieves both first and second order of accuracy this last approximation in space is ensured by reconstructing the conserved variables at the cell edges by means of the linear monotone upwind schemes for scalar conservation laws muscl with minmod limiter toro 1999 the conserved variables are updated at each time step according to the second order runge kutta method providing a second order accuracy in time the set of partial differential equations can be solved on two different structured grids both cartesian vacondio et al 2014 and multi resolution block uniform quadtree buq vacondio et al 2017 given that the dual porosity approach is not over sensitive to the mesh design it can be safely implemented on structured grids which cannot be adapted to meet the strict requirements of proper mesh design needed by e g ip models guinot 2017a with reference to the implementation technique the explicit finite volume scheme is written in cuda c architecture that exploits parallel computation offered by nvidiatm graphic processing units gpus thus significantly reducing the computational time 3 a procedure to infer porosity parameters from building footprints 3 1 basic principles in simulating urban floods with porosity models the adoption of coarse grids entails an unavoidable loss of detail in the representation of the flow field within a urban area with respect to the use of fine grids that resolve buildings explicitly this loss of detail becomes substantial when models are used with uniform porosity distributions within an entire urban district which is the common practice for porosity models in differential form e g cea and vázquez cendón 2010 guinot 2012 guinot and soares frazão 2006 soares frazao et al 2008 to find a reasonable trade off between computational effort and spatial resolution of the flow field description first the grid resolution has to be adequate to the length scale of the problem i e comparable to the width of streets and buildings and second the porosity parameters must reflect the spatial distribution of obstacles and preferential pathways within the urban fabric while the first requirement is relatively easy to meet the second one is actually an open challenge this last issue is here addressed in the framework of the dual porosity model in differential form described in sec 2 1 the four porosity parameters required by the model are supposed to vary inside the built up area so as to account for the spatial distribution of obstacles and preferential flow paths within the urban area accordingly porosity parameters are estimated on a genuine cell by cell basis this is expected to improve the description of the effects exerted by buildings on the flow field both close to and inside the urban area at a spatial scale comparable to that of the relatively coarse grid the same basic idea has been theoretically supported by varra et al 2020 and has been tested by soares frazão et al 2018 in the framework of sp porosity models plus drag terms in tensor form highlighting the benefits of accounting for distributed porosity based on the actual layout of buildings and streets the present method for estimating porosity distributions in real urbanized areas is designed to fulfil some basic principles i the spatial distribution of the porosity parameters should only rely on geometrical information so as to reduce the successive need of model calibration arrault et al 2016 ii the estimation of porosity parameters should be inferred automatically so as to allow straightforward large scale model applications and iii the procedure should be intuitive and controlled by few parameters of clear physical meaning so as to promote easy and trustful use by practitioners 3 2 spatially distributed porosity fields from urban geometry given a relatively coarse computational grid covering a built up area the porosity parameters are evaluated by applying the procedure described in the following to each computational cell in extracting the porosity parameters from geometrical information the computation of the storage porosity ϕ is straightforward fig 1a whereas estimating conveyance porosity effectively is far more complicated as it requires the joint estimation of the principal components and of the associated angles indeed the conveyance porosity is direction dependent and the angles that define the principal directions are not known a priori in general for a hypothetical mean flow direction at an angle αk to the x axis double headed arrow in fig 2 the conveyance porosity ψ αk should be estimated as the width ratio of the narrowest cross section in analogy to the definition of fig 1b then considering that the function ψ αk is periodic with period π i e ψ αk ψ αk π the function ψ αk should be characterized for discrete values of αk in the range 0 π finally once known the behaviour of ψ αk a proper criterion should allow identifying the principal components of the conveyance porosity ψl and ψt along with the angle α that identifies the direction of maximum conveyance ψl fig 1b the proposed approach is a step forward with respect to bruwier et al 2017 who determined the conveyance porosities by evaluating the minimum free length across a coarse cell only in the x and y directions the procedure for the computation of the conveyance porosity principal components is implemented in two different versions denoted as segment based and strip based methods as described in the following the code implemented in fortran language is made available as supplementary material see appendix a 3 2 1 anisotropic conveyance porosity segment based method the first version of the algorithm that computes the porosity parameters is denoted as segment based method fig 3 a it has to be applied to each cell of the computational grid and consists in the following steps 1 identify the buildings and obstacles whose footprint intersects the cell 2 compute the storage porosity ϕ which is the complement to unity of the fraction of cell area occupied by buildings fig 1a using any polygons intersection routine 3 span the sampling directions αk in the interval 0 π as in fig 2 given a number of directions to be considered nα the angular spacing in degrees is δα 180 nα the k th sampling direction is αk k 1 δα with k 1 nα a recommended value for δα is 1 4 segment sampling the cell is temporarily rotated by αk and sampled by considering nsg equispaced segments denoted with index i with spacing dsg l nsg fig 3a 5 evaluate the free length for each of the nsg segments for each segment i once detected the nj parts that overlap the building footprints l 1 and l 2 in fig 3a the total free length is computed as l i free l j 1 n j l j 6 evaluate the conveyance porosity in the αk direction as the ratio of minimum free length to segment length ψ α k min i l i free l this is a simple estimate of the width ratio of the narrowest cross section for the given mean flow direction αk 7 find the angle α for which the reciprocally orthogonal principal components of the conveyance porosity ψl and ψt are closest to the maximum and minimum values among the nα values of the function ψ αk respectively the goal is achieved by finding αk such that the product p ψ ψ α k 1 ψ α k π 2 is maximum and setting α αk indeed pψ attains a maximum when ψ is large along αk and small in the orthogonal direction αk π 2 see fig 4 f for an example 8 determine ψl and ψt considering that the minimum and maximum values of ψ αk are not always orthogonal to each other a trade off is needed the l direction should coincide with that of maximum conveyance α to preserve the flux alignment in preferential pathways e g streets and ψt should be taken as the minimum value of conveyance to represent blocking features correctly accordingly the conveyance parameters are assumed as ψl ψ α and ψt min ψ αk 3 2 2 anisotropic conveyance porosity strip based method the second version of the algorithm is denoted as strip based method fig 3b only points 4 and 5 differ from the segment based method described above 4 strip slicing the cell is temporarily rotated by αk and sliced in nst strips denoted with index i each strip has width dst l nst fig 3b in which nst 3 and dst l 3 5 evaluate the free length for each of the nst strips for each i th strip once found the nj projections on the strip axis of each part of building that overlaps the strip l 1 and l 2 in fig 3b the total length of the strip axis free of any building projection is evaluated as l i free l j 1 n j l j 3 2 3 graphical representation of the conveyance porosity to judge the strengths and weaknesses of the above methods the first step consists in visualizing the algorithm results in terms of direction dependent conveyance porosity ψ αk to reach the goal in the figures hereinafter and in the supplementary data see appendix a the coarse grid is superposed to the building footprints and for each cell the roseplot of ψ αk is plotted considering that ψ αk ranges in the interval 0 1 for each of the nα sampling directions the coordinates of the roseplot line vertexes xrp yrp are obtained as 5 x rp x c 0 4 l ψ α k cos α k y rp y c 0 4 l ψ α k sin α k where xc yc is the cell center and 0 4 is a coefficient that determines the size of the roseplot with respect to the grid size l for each cell two diametral segments are plotted that denote the l blue and t red directions of maximum and minimum conveyance as determined according to points 7 and 8 in sec 3 2 1 3 3 considerations on the segment based and strip based methods this section aims at discussing the pros and cons of the two methods previously described the segment based method is the plainest way to face the problem of conveyance porosity evaluation but it is subject to some limitations a very small segment spacing dsg is required to sample the cell in order to capture the possible presence of linear blocking features as thin walls hodges 2015 this entails a large number of segments to be analyzed which requires a significant computational effort even if it is performed only once before running the simulation most importantly the free length of each segment l i free is estimated regardless of what happens upstream and downstream of the segment itself seldom leading to inconsistencies this is shown with some examples in fig 4 a slender building or a linear blocking feature is sampled through segments a and strips d for the hypothetical flow direction αk 90 the roseplots of ψ αk are obtained by analyzing all directions in the range 0 π panels c and f show the trend of ψ αk green lines which is then translated by π 2 grey lines to obtain its complement to one grey dashed line and in turn the product pψ αk black dotted line the longitudinal l direction blue lines in b c e f is the one that maximizes the product pψ and the transverse t direction red lines in b c e f is assumed as orthogonal to l this is the criterion chosen to determine the most reliable principal components for conveyance ψ according to point 7 in sec 3 2 1 in fig 4 while the segment based method a is unable to recognize the whole width of the obstacle the green segments are far shorter than the total building width the strip based method succeeds since the dark green portion of the strip in d is as wide as the obstacle the segment derived roseplot in b shows similar values of ψ αk in the north south and in the east west directions as a consequence the criterion based on the product pψ is unable to recognize orthogonal principal directions of maximum and minimum conveyance properly c the strip based roseplot e shows a significantly lower conveyance in the north south direction and more realistic results also for the entire range of directions this allows detecting the principal directions correctly the comparison of panels c and f in fig 4 suggests that the criterion to determine the principal components described at point 7 in sec 3 2 1 works well when ψ αk shows nearly orthogonal maxima and minima otherwise it fails in determining the direction of minimum conveyance but not the value of minimum conveyance ψt which is chosen regardless of the actual value of ψ in the t direction according to point 8 in sec 3 2 1 in fig 5 the segment and strip based methods are applied to the checkerboard building arrangement of the toce experiment testa et al 2007 to obtain accurate results in the same urban layout using a coarse grid ferrari et al 2019 highlighted the need of using lower values of conveyance porosity than the free length computed for a single row of buildings indeed the staggered arrangement of buildings imposes severe successive deviations to the flow thus increasing the resistances with respect to the case of aligned buildings for this reason the conveyance porosity computed accounting for a single row of buildings is far greater than the effective one although the segment based method is expected to work properly when the grid size is comparable to or smaller than the size of buildings when using coarser grids as in fig 5a the segment based sampling is unable to capture the tortuosity of floodwater pathways within the cell thus overestimating the real conveyance the strip based method is expected to perform similarly well to the segment based method for finer grids and significantly better in case of coarser grids as in the case of fig 5c in the considered direction the strip based estimate of conveyance porosity accounts for the staggered arrangement of buildings i e for the tortuosity of pathways within the cell the obtained value corresponds to the theoretical one ψ 8 0 2 buildings are 0 15 m wide and l 1 7 m in this case to sum up the strip based method improves the estimation of the conveyance porosity by considering all the blocking features that overlap a strip orthogonal to the assumed flow direction by increasing the strip width information is added that concerns the presence of obstacles both upstream and downstream accordingly a tortuous path is given a lower conveyance porosity than a straight path it is interesting to note that the strip based method reduces to the segment based method in the limit dst 0 with dst the strip width thus implying that the segment based method is actually a special case of the more general strip based method in view of giving some operating instructions on the application of the strip based method the strip width has to be chosen as large as possible i e dst l in order to recognize the real direction of preferential pathways e g streets correctly and also to reflect the tortuosity of floodwater pathways within each single cell on the other hand when very coarse grids are used to model dense urban layouts with irregularly arranged obstacles the adoption of excessively wide strips may result in a significant underestimation of the conveyance porosity simply speaking one can obtain ψl ψt 0 meaning that the flow is inhibited in all directions also when obstacle interspaces are well interconnected accordingly to reflect the connectivity of the urban medium yet avoiding misrepresentations the strip width should be taken larger than the typical length scale of the urban layout although being careful of not exceeding it too much finally focusing on the computational efforts required by the two methods the strip based method is generally faster as the number of strips nst is typically much smaller than the number of segments nsg implying that the number of line polygon intersections to be computed is largely lower for the strip based method nonetheless it is worth noting that the porosity parameters are evaluated for each cell of the coarse grid only once in a pre processing step the computation of the spatially distributed porosity parameters for the finest meshes of the test cases shown in sec 4 is performed in a few minutes and does not affect the simulation runtime the resulting parameters are kept constant during the simulation thus assuming that both storage and conveyance porosities are not depth dependent bruwier et al 2017 guinot et al 2018 li and hodges 2019 özgen et al 2016 2015 rong et al 2020 4 results the segment and strip based methods presented in sec 3 are tested by simulating the flooding in a laboratory experiment the toce case study testa et al 2007 and in two complex urban districts the laboratory experiment with staggered obstacles is chosen because previous applications of the porosity model with a uniform porosity distribution required particular values of porosity parameters a need that makes not obvious the successful application of the present algorithm then since the main novelty of this work is to allow computing the porosity parameters in real urban layouts two districts in northern italy are chosen as benchmarks which are representative of complex urban fabrics with irregular shaped buildings and streets courtyards gardens walls etc in all the tests the spatial distribution of the four porosity parameters is extracted geometrically using the two above methods and the parflood model is used to solve the porous 2d swes with anisotropic friction see sec 2 2 the model results are compared against reference refined solutions obtained by solving the classical 2d swes again with the parflood model on fine grids in which buildings and obstacles are explicitly resolved building hole method schubert and sanders 2012 all the simulations were run on a nvidia tesla p100 gpu the model sensitivity to the bottom roughness and to the inflow boundary conditions was already addressed in ferrari et al 2019 hence in this work only the sensitivity of the porosity model to the mesh size and to the parameters controlling the computation of conveyance is tested it is well known that the size of the coarse grid cells affects the accuracy of the numerical solution in terms of flow depth and velocity sanders and schubert 2019 more importantly in this case the porosity fields are expected to change dramatically with the resolution of the coarse grid this is because the number and the position of buildings and obstacles within a cell strongly depend on its size and location the goal is to demonstrate that the change of grid resolution and the contextual change in the porosity fields lead to similar results and that these results tend towards the reference solution for increasing grid resolutions as a final note the footprints of buildings and walls are superposed to all the figures referring to porous results for facilitating the comparison even if they are not explicitly resolved in the computation 4 1 the toce experimental case study before proceeding with the application to realistic urban layouts and to the sensitivity analysis the two methods are firstly compared considering the toce river experiment eu impact project testa et al 2007 the benchmark is a physical model in scale 1 100 which reproduces the flooding in the toce valley northern italy a checkerboard building layout with 18 square concrete building blocks of 15 cm side length is used to simulate the presence of a urban environment such a building arrangement has already been discussed in sec 3 3 and in fig 5 the porosity formulation recalled in sec 2 2 was already tested against this experimental benchmark using a uniform distribution of porosity parameters ferrari et al 2019 but the successful application of the model required a particular value of conveyance porosity obtained by collapsing two consecutive rows of buildings hence it is not obvious that the algorithm for porosity computation is able to extract effective porosity distributions for the same schematic but not trivial building layout in the simulations the initially dry domain is flooded by a 60 s long high inflow discharge entering the river testa et al 2007 and a free outflow condition is specified at the end of the valley reach the domain is characterized by a manning roughness coefficient equal to n 0 0162 m 1 3 s testa et al 2007 in the reference solution buildings are explicitly resolved on a cartesian grid with square cells of size δx 1 cm the segment and strip based methods are used for the porous configuration with δx 5 cm conveyance porosity is computed considering either a segment spacing dsg 5 mm or a strip width dst l 5 cm the water depths and velocities provided by the different methods are compared in fig 6 water depth and fig 7 velocity at time t 14 s the comparison shows that both the segment and strip based methods allow reproducing the hydraulic jump that forms just upstream the obstacles and the main flow features correctly in particular the velocity maps shown in fig 7 highlight that the adoption of spatial distributed porosity fields allows describing the flow field variability within the urban area and not only the effect of obstacles on the external flow field as in uniform porosity applications ferrari et al 2019 fig 8 compares the water level time series recorded at gauge locations alcrudo et al 2002 testa et al 2007 with those simulated by explicitly resolving the buildings and with the porosity parameters obtained with the strip and segment based methods all the approaches provide similar results and show a generally good agreement with the measured values importantly the use of spatially distributed porosity fields improves the model results at the internal points p5 and p6 with respect to the uniform porosity parameters assumed in ferrari et al 2019 the segment and strip based methods provide very similar results in this case this is expected see sec 3 3 considering that the resolution of the coarse grid 5 cm is smaller than the geometrical length scale of the problem buildings size is 15 15 cm as discussed in sec 3 3 and in agreement with the schematic examples of figs 4 and 5 the strip based method tends to provide lower values for ψt than the segment based method resulting in slightly more dissipative scenarios this is confirmed by the slightly larger water depths obtained with the strip based method 4 2 the spinea district case study the first urban layout here analyzed is inspired by a district in the town of spinea in northern italy fig 9 this middle density area presents different shaped buildings which are separated one another by small walls surrounded by gardens and courtyards which act as temporally storage areas during flooding viero 2019 in the simulations the domain is characterized by a bottom slope of 0 09 southward and a manning roughness coefficient n 0 029 m 1 3 s the domain is initially dry in the central 50 m of the northern edge an inflow boundary condition is prescribed in the form of a 2 hours gamma distributed flood wave fig 10 with a peak value of about 600 m3 s free outflow is assumed at the southern edge the computational domain is discretized using a cartesian grid with square cells of size δx 0 5 m for the refined solution and δx 2 5 10 20 and 50 m for the porous simulations the porous tests adopt the porosity fields resulting from both the segment and strip based methods for this latter case different strip widths are considered the main features of the simulations are reported in table 1 the model results at the arrival of the flood peak 0 6 h are shown in fig 11 water depths and fig 12 velocity fields for the reference simulation and for the porous applications with δx 5 m and 20 m looking at the maps as a whole it emerges that the adoption of spatially distributed porosity parameters allows capturing the most relevant features of flooding both outside and inside the urbanized area in terms of water depths fig 11 the porosity schemes capture the rise of the water depths north of the built up area orange red zone and the downstream drop purple blue zone south east with a slight loss of accuracy associated to grid coarsening passing from id 4 to id 10 or equivalently from id 5 to id 13 in terms of velocity fields fig 12 the porosity schemes well capture the high velocity zone at the northern edge orange red the middle one at west green and the low one at south east purple blue differences with the reference solution can be found essentially in terms of velocity in external areas at the beginning or end of streets due to the presence of singularities that only a resolved scheme on a fine mesh can capture properly the comparison of large scale maps shows that the porosity fields provided by the segment and by the strip based methods as for example test id 4 or id 10 segments against test id 5 or id 13 strips produce negligible differences in the simulated flow fields for grid resolutions of 5 and 20 m obviously the results depend on the grid resolution the simulations with δx 5 m id 4 id 5 agree with the reference solution id 1 better than the ones with δx 20 m id 10 id 13 the choice of a proper grid resolution is thus related to the flow field definition needed by the modeler and not to specific requirements of the porosity approach besides the large scale analysis of the flow field around the built up area interesting information can be gained by looking at the inner velocity fields fig 13 as mentioned at the beginning of sec 3 1 the use of porosity models entails an unavoidable loss of details in the flow field within the urban area essentially due to the adoption of coarse meshes in which buildings are not resolved explicitly nonetheless the zoom view of fig 13 shows that the use of spatially distributed porosity fields evaluated with the methods of sec 3 2 allows reproducing the flow concentration along the main streets expectedly the velocity values obtained in the reference solution id 1 with δx 0 5 m cannot be captured accurately with grids that are at least one order of magnitude coarser δx 5 m the comparison of id 10 and id 13 maps in fig 13 shows that for coarser grids the strip based method describes the blocking effects exerted by buildings and garden walls better than the segment based method indeed in the western part of the built up area flow velocity is lower in id 13 purple colors than in id 10 blue colors for the same time instant fig 14 compares the total depth indicator which accounts for simultaneous water depth and velocity representing the water depth at rest d whose static force is equivalent to the total force of the flow aureli et al 2008 ferrari et al 2019 according to 6 d h 1 2 f where h represents the water depth and f the froude number the partition showed in the low left panel of fig 14 allows for the definition of the following classes low 0 d 0 5 m medium 0 5 d 1 m high 1 d 1 5 m and very high d 1 5 m focusing on the effects exerted by the built up area on the neighbouring ones fig 14 highlights that the porosity results well match the reference one moreover the porous scenarios capture the upper zone with high hazard level inside the urban patch whereas they slightly overestimate the medium rank in the middle of the urban area a more systematic analysis of the model performance for all the simulations run is carried out by quantifying the l 2 error norm for the maximum water depth and the maximum velocity according to 7 l 2 f 1 n i 1 n f por i f re f i 2 where n denotes the number of computational cells f is the variable of interest maximum water depth hmax or velocity magnitude umax por and ref subscripts identify the porous and reference solutions respectively the analysis of error norms reported in table 1 gives further insights the capability of both the segment and strip based methods in extracting reliable porosity parameters is confirmed by the relatively small values assumed by the error norms importantly smaller error norms are obtained by increasing the grid resolution indicating that the coarse solutions tend to the reference solution the error norms increase significantly when passing from δx 20 m to δx 50 m confirming the importance of choosing the grid size carefully on the base of the length scale of the problem in this case δx 50 m denotes a cell size two order of magnitude larger than the reference one and five times larger than the typical street width which is about 10 m in this test fig 9 for a given grid resolution the errors associated to the different methods segments or strips are similar to each other for finer grids whereas the strip based method performs slightly better in the case of coarser grids i e in line with the reasoning reported in sec 3 3 finally it is relevant to notice the high reduction of the runtimes that can be achieved in the porous simulations as an example the cases id 2 and id 3 which adopt the finest mesh here used for the porous simulations δx 2 m run about 48 times faster than the simulation with resolved buildings id 1 119 5 2 5 this gap enlarges up to two order of magnitude when using coarser meshes e g 119 5 0 03 4 3 the palmanova town case study the third model application deals with the modelling of a flood wave in a radial city as that of palmanova northern italy in which buildings and streets converge to a central hexagon square fig 15 the goal is validating the effectiveness of the spatial distribution of porosity parameters provided by the algorithms of sec 3 2 also in a complex urban area characterized by a non conventional building alignment the domain which is shown in fig 16 is given a southward bottom slope of 0 08 in the simulations a manning roughness coefficient n 0 029 m 1 3s is assumed as in the previous test the initially dry domain is flooded by the 2 h long gamma distributed flood wave shown in fig 10 the upstream inflow boundary condition is prescribed in the central 50 m of the northern edge of the domain free outflow is assumed at the southern edge a cartesian grid with square cells of size δx 0 4 m is used to discretize the domain for the reference solution with resolved buildings and δx 2 5 10 and 20 m for the porous simulations again the porous tests adopt the porosity fields resulting from both the segment and strip based methods and for this latter case different strip widths are considered the main features of the simulations are reported in table 2 analogously to the previous test the model results at the arrival of the flood peak 0 6 h are shown in fig 17 water depths and fig 18 velocity fields for the reference simulation and for the porous applications with δx 5 m and 20 m compared with the reference solution id 1 the anisotropic porous solutions on the δx 5 m grid id 4 and id 5 well capture the deeper water depths at the entrance of the urban area yellow orange values the flooding characteristics in the north part of the built up zone green values and the low depth zone at south purple values moreover also for this urban layout the segment and strip based methods show minimal differences with δx 5 m and 20 m for both the methods the use of a coarser mesh size δx 20 m in id 8 and id 10 entails an excessive increment of the water depth inside the urban area norther part and for this reason it seems less adequate to model this scenario accurately a look at the velocity fields in fig 18 confirms that the results with δx 5 m id 4 and id 5 match the reference solution id 1 well the high flow velocity zone in the north part of the domain orange red values and the medium one in the upstream semicircle green zone is captured quite accurately the δx 20 m grid confirms a loss of accuracy importantly the detailed view in fig 19 reveals that the porous modelling allows for partially reproducing the flow field variability within the built up area id 4 and id 5 although only the high resolution reference solution id 1 succeeds in modelling the flow field among small pathways also the coarse grid allows identifying some preferential flow directions with pathways characterized by larger flow velocities for the same time instant fig 20 compares the total depth indicator of eq 6 obtained from the different scenarios the use of δx 5 m grid resolution allows capturing the overall hazard rank regardless of the method used to extract the porosity fields implying that such a grid size is suitable given the typical length scale of the problem with the δx 20 m grid the segment based method leads to an overestimation of the high hazard level in the north whereas the strip based method still provides accurate results confirming that the strip based method performs better on coarse grids with the aim of analyzing the model results quantitatively the l2 error norms are evaluated according to eq 7 for both the maximum water depth and velocity magnitude table 2 the analysis leads to the same conclusions as in the spinea test model errors do not vary with the chosen algorithm segment or strip based significantly for lower mesh sizes whereas the strip based method is better suited for coarser grids moreover when the mesh size is relatively large e g δx 20 m the errors increase significantly essentially for the loss of details in describing the flow field within the built up area finally the analysis of the runtimes reported in table 2 further confirms the great advantage of the porous approach with respect to the explicit solution of buildings for example looking at cases id 2 and id 3 that still adopt a relatively fine grid δx 2 m the computational burden is reduced up to 90 times if compared with the resolved simulation 250 56 2 78 5 discussion and conclusions the present work dealt with a method to extract the spatial distribution of porosity parameters from building and obstacle footprints to be used in the dual porosity model proposed by viero 2019 and by ferrari et al 2019 a fortran implementation of the algorithm is available in a permanent repository for free download and use detailed information in appendix a the key feature of the proposed method is the computation of the direction dependent conveyance porosity which is performed by analysing the connectivity and the presence of preferential pathways within the cell and not only at cell edges as in integral porosity models guinot et al 2017 sanders et al 2008 the effectiveness of the implemented method was assessed first by visual inspection superposing the roseplots of conveyance porosity to the building footprints to check the algorithm ability in detecting obstructions and preferential pathways correctly then the porosity fields provided by the algorithm were used to simulate the flooding of experimental and realistic urban layouts with the porous version of the parflood model the results were found to compare well with the reference solutions obtained using refined grids with explicitly resolved buildings the proposed method proved able to account for the presence of blocking features which are known to affect the flow field substantially hodges 2015 li and hodges 2019 as well as for the role of large streets as preferential pathways and global flow pattern separators chen et al 2018 the model application to complex case studies suggests that the effects of restrictions are fairly reproduced despite they are modelled through a modification of friction resistance only li and hodges 2020 notwithstanding the considerable variability of porosity fields with the grid resolution the results in terms of flow field characteristics water depths and velocities were limited to the expected loss of accuracy associated with grid coarsening confirming the substantial independence of the porosity approach to the computational grid it s worth stressing that the proposed method was conceived in the framework of large scale subgrid modelling of major flooding events in urbanized areas specific attention was paid to reproduce the effects exerted by the main obstacles that characterize complex urban layouts urban micro features which can significantly influence the simulated inundation extent and depth mignot et al 2013 wang et al 2018 yu and lane 2011 were not considered for now as a final note viero 2019 warned that assuming the existence of two reciprocally orthogonal principal directions for the conveyance porosity is likely too simplistic to capture the complexity of real urban settlements under general conditions the application of the methods presented above shows that the cell conveyance is well represented by the tensor formulation with two reciprocally orthogonal principal directions in particular when it is mainly determined by the presence of a single dominant obstacle on the contrary in the presence of multiple either aligned or staggered obstacles within a cell the conveyance function ψ α presents multiple maxima and minima for example see the three local maxima in the green roseplot of fig 5d which reveal the presence of multiple preferential pathways along different directions in such cases the tensor formulation proposed by viero 2019 and ferrari et al 2019 cannot reproduce the peculiar behaviours of ψ α properly in assessing the case of aligned buildings velickovic et al 2017 proposed to use drag terms along with suitable amplification coefficients depending on the flow direction a solution then

5272,with rapid climatic warming glaciers in the source region of the yangtze river sryr generally experienced apparent terminus retreats over the past several decades however the influence of glacier melting in the river runoff of the sryr remains poorly known due to lack of glacier mass balance measurements in this study we derived the glacier mass changes of the sryr in 2000 2018 by comparing the digital elevation models dems produced from ziyuan 3 tri stereo scenes with the srtm dem glacier mass balances were spatially heterogeneous range from 0 55 0 12 to 0 14 0 05 m w e yr 1 in the sryr which may be mainly attributed to the spatial difference in snowfall variation overall the glacier mass loss of 0 343 0 055 gt yr 1 was estimated for the entire sryr by using the hydrological data recorded by the zhimenda station we calculated the annual runoff of 17 84 gt yr 1 between 2000 and 2018 therefore the contribution of glacier mass loss to the river runoff of the sryr was only 1 9 0 3 in 2000 2018 our results reveal that glacier melting was not the major water resource in the sryr during recent decades keywords glacier mass loss river runoff the source region of the yangtze river tibetan plateau ziyuan 3 1 introduction the source region of the yangtze river sryr with an area of 1 4 105 km2 covers about 17 of the entire yangtze river basin yao et al 2014 li et al 2017 furthermore the runoff of rivers in the sryr which are generally originated from mountain glaciers provides approximately 20 of the total river discharge of the yangtze river mao et al 2016 thus the river runoff of the sryr is a significant fresh water resource for hundreds of millions of people live in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin yang et al 2007 during recent decades the sryr experienced an apparent air temperature increase of 0 6 c per decade which is about four times that of global mean kang et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 for this rapid climatic warming a pronounced terminus retreat was observed for most glaciers in the sryr zhang et al 2008 2013b yao et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 ke et al 2017 however the measurement of glacier mass balance which is the key indicator of glacier status was scarce in the sryr consequently an accurate estimation of glacier mass change and its contribution to river runoff is urgently needed in the sryr for investigating the variations of water resource in the yangtze river basin for estimating regional glacier mass change field measurements are usually used to extrapolate to the rest glacierized zones with no observations meier et al 2007 cogley 2009 although a few of field measurements of glacier mass balances have been conducted in the tibetan plateau tp for many years yao et al 2012 this extrapolation method suffers from the paucity of in situ observations yao et al 2012 and the spatially heterogeneous glacier mass balance in the tp kääb et al 2012 brun et al 2017 shean et al 2020 specifically in the sryr field measurements of glacier mass balances were only conducted over the xiaodongkemadi glacier between 1989 and 2010 mean glacier mass loss of 0 24 m w e yr 1 was observed for this glacier yao et al 2012 according to the second chinese glacier inventory scgi the number of glaciers is approximately 900 in the sryr guo et al 2015 taking the heterogeneous glacier mass change into consideration this in situ observation cannot be simply extrapolated to the whole glacierized regions of the sryr in addition an empirical function between glacier area and volume was applied to monitor glacier mass balance of the entire sryr liu et al 2009 yao et al 2014 according to the changes of glacierized area liu et al 2009 and yao et al 2014 detected that glacier mass balance of the sryr was about 1 05 and 1 71 m w e yr 1 during the periods of 1961 2000 and 1986 2009 respectively however a pronounced overestimation of glacier mass loss was reported by comparing with the observed mass balances of glaciers in the himalayan mountain range in the similar period bolch et al 2011 zhou et al 2018b the glacier mass loss of 0 32 0 08 m w e yr 1 was estimated for the everest area between 1970 and 2007 bolch et al 2011 and the measured glacier mass loss was 0 30 0 12 m w e yr 1 over the sikkim in 1975 2000 zhou et al 2018b in general during a similar period glaciers in the tanggula mountains and east kunlun mountains lost less mass than those in the monsoon dominated regions gardner et al 2013 brun et al 2017 shean et al 2020 because of the limited influence of indian summer monsoon yao et al 2012 consequently these overestimated glacier mass losses probably result in an overestimation about the contribution of glacier mass loss to river runoff in the sryr in recent years the geodetic method has been widely used to estimate glacier mass changes in the tp and its surroundings due to the rapid development of satellite remote sensing berthier et al 2007 bolch et al 2011 kääb et al 2012 gardelle et al 2013 zhou et al 2018b liu et al 2019 however large scale detailed observations of glacier mass balance over the entire sryr are still scarce and a few recent studies focused on the geladandong mountain and dongkemadi both of which are located on the southwest region of the sryr based on icesat laser altimetry data the glacier mass losses of 0 13 and 0 48 m w e yr 1 in the period 2003 2008 were observed for the geladandong mountain chao et al 2017 and dongkemadi ke et al 2017 respectively by comparing the digital elevation models dems in different times the glacier mass balances of 0 12 0 22 m w e yr 1 in 2000 2014 liu et al 2017 and 0 11 0 03 m w e yr 1 in 2000 2012 liu et al 2020 were estimated over the geladandong mountain these previous studies revealed that the glacier mass loss of dongkemadi was much more than that of galadandong mountain in the first decade of the 21st century this infers that the existing local field measurements and geodetic estimations are probably not representative of the whole glacierized regions of the sryr due to heterogeneous glacier mass balance in this study we aimed to accurately estimate glacier mass balance with the geodetic method over the entire sryr and evaluate its contribution to river runoff during recent decades for better coverage of the glacierized regions the c band srtm srtm c dem was used as a reference topographic data the recent glacier surface dems were generated with 13 pairs of ziyuan 3 zy3 tri stereo optical images the possible systematic biases of radar penetration depths and seasonal glacier mass changes were corrected for an accurate estimation of glacier mass balances moreover by comparing the observed glacier mass change and hydrological data in the same period we assessed the contribution of glacier mass loss to river runoff in the sryr in addition we analyzed the impact of regional climate variations with respect to glacier mass balance 2 description of study area the sryr is located at the middle eastern part of the tp between the kunlun mountain range and the tanggula mountain range fig 1 the spatial pattern of annual precipitation range from 280 mm to 480 mm is generally determined by the topography yao et al 2014 the daily average air temperature of higher than 5 c was detected over most of the basin in the summer months over the past several decades the climate warming trend was recorded by an ice core drilled on the upper zone of the guoqu glacier in the past 500 years zhang et al 2016 as exhibited in fig 1 the glacierized regions of the sryr are mainly distributed at the northern slop of the tanggula mountain range moreover some glaciers are existing over the northern slop of the sedir mountain and the southern slop of the kunlun mountain range here four study sites two in the tanggula mountain range one in the sedir mountain and one in the kunlun mountain range were selected for estimating glacier mass balance of the sryr mountain glaciers over the four study sites are belong to summer accumulation type because snowfall mainly occurs between june and august maussion et al 2014 snow and ice melt water of glaciers in the sryr flows into the main stream of the tongtian river by several tributaries river runoff has been continuously observed for more than half a century by the zhimenda hydrological station which was built up at the downstream of the tongtian river in july 1956 during the past decades the average annual runoff of the tongtian river was 15 79 gt yr 1 with a pronounced inter decade variation luo et al 2019 the maximum value of 18 09 gt yr 1 was observed in the 2000s and the minimum value of 13 37 gt yr 1 was recorded in the 1990s luo et al 2019 3 data and methods 3 1 ziyuan 3 images and dem generation two space borne dems were used to observe glacier elevation changes over the four study sites the more recent dems were produced from zy3 tri stereo optical images the zy3 satellite series are the first civilian high resolution stereo mapping satellites of china pan et al 2013 until now two zy3 satellites 01 and 02 have been launched in the sun synchronous orbit with a height of about 506 km and 180 degrees phase apart pan et al 2016 both the two satellites were equipped with three panchromatic cameras for linear push broom imaging in three directions of forward backward and nadir tang et al 2013 pan et al 2016 the main parameters of three panchromatic cameras in the zy3 02 satellite are the same as those in the zy3 01 satellite except an improvement in the spatial resolution of forward and backward cameras from 3 5 m to 2 5 m xu et al 2017 in this study we employed 13 pairs of zy3 02 tri stereo scenes acquired between december 2016 and february 2018 to generate the recent glacier surface dems over the four study sites table 1 the coverage of these optical images is shown as dark red rectangles in fig 1 it is noteworthy that the threshold value of cloud cover was set to 10 for minimizing data gaps because the void areas in the reconstructed dems are mainly caused by cloud cover in the used tri stereo optical images the zy3 dems were produced by space data processor sdp software from the land satellite remote sensing application center ministry of natural resources of the people s republic of china here the process of dense tri stereo matching was conducted by using the tri epipolar image generating method for a reliable matching in the steep and very low texture areas tang et al 2018 in the sryr no ground control point gcp is available for dem generation due to the remote location basically without gcp the vertical accuracy of the generated zy3 topographic data is approximately 6 10 m fratarcangeli et al 2016 zhou et al 2018a data gaps attributed to cloud cover in the used optical images were not filled by any interpolation 3 2 srtm dem and radar penetration correction the glacier surface dem derived from the shuttle radar topography mission was used as the reference topographic data in february 2000 two interferometric sar systems were equipped on the srtm mission with different frequency c band and x band rabus et al 2003 here we used the srtm c dem for better coverage of the glacierized regions over the four study sites because the x band radar in the srtm srtm x was operated to acquire data along discrete 50 km wide swaths rabus et al 2003 the penetration depth of c band radar signal into snow or ice is needed to be firstly corrected for detecting glacier elevation changes with the srtm c dem gardelle et al 2012a in the glacierized regions of the tp and its surroundings based on the simply no x band penetration assumption gardelle et al 2012a the c band radar penetration depths are typically determined by the elevation differences between the x band and c band srtm dems gardelle et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 cao et al 2019 however a non negligible x band radar penetration depth in winter season was detected in the pamir mountains lambrecht et al 2018 and the inner tp liu et al 2019 in this study the correction value of c band radar penetration depth was estimated by adding x band radar penetration depth to c x band radar penetration difference specifically we employed the polynomial function between x band radar penetration depth and altitude over the puruogangri ice field inner tp liu et al 2019 moreover we also calculated the difference of c x band radar penetration depth as a polynomial function of altitude by comparing the srtm c dem with the srtm x dem both the corrections of x band radar penetration depth and c x band radar penetration difference were applied to each glacier surface pixel of the four study sites separately 3 3 dem co registration and differencing we subtracted the corrected srtm c dem from the generated zy3 dems to derive glacier elevation changes over the four study sites as listed in table 1 most of the used zy3 02 tri stereo optical images were acquired in december 2017 and january and february 2018 therefore we assumed that the observed results could represent the mean glacier elevation changes in the period of 2000 2018 based on a neglect of the possible inter annual variation before the process of dem differencing the vertical discrepancy attributed to the horizontal deviation between the two used dems is needed to be eliminated firstly berthier et al 2007 in this study we employed the universal co registration method suggested by nuth and kaab 2011 to accurately match all the pairs of the used dems moreover each zy3 dem was compared to its corresponding srtm c dem to observe elevation changes separately glacier surface elevation changes were detected by masking the results of dem differencing with the glacier boundaries obtained from the scgi as shown in fig 1 in general the scgi glacier outlines were delineated with the landsat optical images collected between 2006 and 2010 guo et al 2015 here in order to derive glacier elevation changes since 2000 terminus locations of non surge glaciers over the four study sites were manually corrected with cloud free landsat scenes in 1999 or 2000 we used the landsat optical images in 1999 because of no available data acquired in 2000 over some glacierized regions moreover we updated the terminus locations of surge type glaciers with the landsat scenes obtained in the similar date of the used zy3 02 scenes for the results of dem differencing in the glacierized regions we removed the bias caused by the different spatial resolution of the two used dems with a polynomial function between elevation difference and altitude over the off glacier regions furthermore similar with that in liu et al 2016 the glacier surface pixels with a slope angle of greater than 25 degrees were excluded before calculating mean glacier elevation change in addition the threshold of 150 m which was determined by investigating previous studies in these glacierized regions was used to identify the outliers of the observed elevation changes over non surge glaciers the threshold of glacier elevation changes was set to 200 m for surge type glaciers like the generation of zy3 dems we also did not fill the void zones for all the measured results of glacier elevation changes 3 4 glacier mass balance estimation and uncertainty analysis glacier mass balances of the four study sites were estimated from mean glacier elevation changes by using the conversion factor of 850 kg m 3 proposed by huss 2013 in general for a glacierized region the elevation changes of all the glacier pixels over an altitude band are subject to the gaussian distribution berthier et al 2004 gardelle et al 2012b therefore we calculated the mean glacier elevation change of every study site for 50 m altitude bands moreover over an altitude interval the threshold of three standard deviations was used to minimize the impact of random errors in the calculated mean value note mean glacier elevation change was separately calculated over each surge type glacier because the altitudinal distributions of the glacier elevation changes of surge type glaciers are always different from each other gardelle et al 2013 in order to estimate the annual rate of glacier mass balance seasonal glacier mass change is a possible systematic bias here the c band srtm radar images were acquired in february whereas most of the zy3 02 tri stereo scenes were collected in december and january table 1 thus we needed to correct the systematic bias of seasonal glacier mass changes of 1 2 months in winter however both the accumulation and ablation of summer accumulation glaciers mainly occur in the summer season consequently no seasonal glacier mass change in the winter months was needed to be corrected for all glaciers over the four study sites overall the estimation of glacier mass balance δ b over each study site can be summarized by the following equation 1 δ b δ h p x δ p x c ρ glac t ρ w where δ h p x and δ p x c are the mean value of glacier elevation change the penetration depth of x band radar signal and c x band radar penetration depth difference respectively t is the integer number of years for the study period ρ glac 850 kg m 3 is conversion factor and ρ w 1000 kg m 3 is the density of water 2 δ h δ h i s i s total where s i and δ h i are glacier area and mean glacier elevation change over an altitude band respectively s total is the total area of the glacierized regions over a study site as shown in fig 1 not all the glacierized regions of the four study sites are located in the sryr in order to assess the contribution of glacier mass loss to the runoff of the sryr we excluded the glaciers without the sryr the glacier mass balance of the entire sryr was calculated as the area weighted average of the geodetic glacier mass balance estimates over the four study sites the area which was applied as the weight is the glacier area of the portion of glacierized regions in the sryr for each study site moreover the mass balance of the unmeasured glaciers was assumed to be equal to that of the entire sryr we assessed the uncertainty of glacier mass balance in the entire sryr by employing the errors of the derived glacier mass balances over the four study sites based on the standard law of error propagation the uncertainty of glacier mass balance σ δ b over a study site is mainly originated from the errors of mean glacier elevation change x band radar penetration depth c x band radar penetration depth difference and conversion factor 3 σ δ b δ h p x δ p x c 2 σ ρ glac 2 σ δ h 2 σ p x 2 σ δ p x c 2 ρ glac 2 t ρ w where σ ρ glac is the error of conversion factor huss 2013 suggested that σ ρ glac 60 kg m 3 is approximately 7 of conversion factor σ p x and σ δ p x c are the errors of x band radar penetration depth and c x band radar penetration depth difference respectively here we assumed that the two errors were equal to their corresponding standard deviations because both the correction values were calculated as a polynomial function of altitude and applied to each glacier surface pixel separately moreover σδh is the error of mean glacier elevation change over a study site 4 σ δ h σ δ h i 2 s i 2 s total 2 δ h 2 σ s total 2 s total 2 where σ s total is the error of total glacier area over a study site in this study glacier terminus locations were manually modified with landsat optical scenes we thus assumed an uncertainty of 5 for the total glacier area paul et al 2013 σ δ h i is the statistic error of the observed glacier elevation change over an altitude band 5 σ δ h i std v i n ef f i where std v i and n ef f i are the standard deviation of mean glacier elevation change and the number of independent pixels respectively 6 n ef f i n i p s 2 d sp where n i is the number of glacier pixels over an altitude band ps is the spatial resolution of the used dems d sp is the distance of spatial autocorrelation here this distance was calculated with the semivariogram model the uncertainty of glacier mass balance estimation over the unmeasured glacierized regions was assumed to be twice that of the entire sryr 3 5 river runoff calculation the melt water of mountain glaciers in the sryr flows into the main stream of the tongtian river by several tributaries fig 1 two hydrological stations have been installed in the sryr for recording river runoff the tuotuohe station is at the downstream of the tuotuo river and the zhimenda station is at the downstream of the tongtian river the tuotuo river is one of the tributaries of the tongtian river therefore in order to evaluate the contribution of glacier mass loss to annual river runoff of the entire sryr we employed the hydrological data of the tongtian river during the 2000s and 2010s the annual runoffs of 18 09 and 17 54 gt yr 1 were recorded by the zhimenda station respectively luo et al 2019 we thus computed a mean value of 17 84 gt yr 1 for the annual river runoffs of the tongtian river between 2000 and 2018 furthermore considering that snow and ice melting of glaciers in the sryr mainly occurs in the summer months maussion et al 2014 we estimated the contribution of glacier mass loss to river runoff during the flood season between may and october based on the recorded runoffs in the 2000s 13 96 gt yr 1 and 2010s 13 58 gt yr 1 luo et al 2019 the mean runoff of 13 79 gt yr 1 was calculated for the flood season of the tongtian river in 2000 2018 3 6 climatic data and decade trend analysis glacier mass balance is a direct indicator of glacier s response to regional climate changes wgms 2008 ipcc 2013 in general glacial material for accumulation is mainly provided by snowfall and glacier ablation caused by ice or snow melting is affected by air temperature zhang et al 2013a huintjes et al 2015 li et al 2018 here in order to assess the impact of regional climate changes on glacier mass balances of the four study sites we employed the snowfall and 2 m air temperature records between 1979 and 2018 obtained from the era 5 reanalysis data for mountain glaciers over these study sites summer accumulation type both the accumulation and ablation concentrate on the summer months we thus estimated the decade trends of total summer snowfall and mean summer air temperature in 1979 2018 the temporal trends of climate changes were estimated by using the method of linear regression analysis the decade trend was computed as twelve times the first order coefficient of the regression equation moreover the decade trend of annual snowfall was assessed in this study for the reason that the snowfall in other seasons of the year may be a supply of glacial material in addition we also analyzed the trend of mean air temperature between may and september because glacier melting may occur in may and september due to relatively high air temperature 4 results 4 1 radar penetration depth table 2 lists the mean values of c band radar signal penetration depths over the four study sites in general we detected a c band radar penetration depth of greater than 2 1 m for all the four study sites and the maximum correction of 2 85 0 32 m over the geladandong the penetration depth of c band radar signal into glacier surface is 2 57 0 22 m on the dongkemadi study site the c band radar penetration depth over the sedir 2 21 0 21 m is relatively small and similar with that over the kunlun study site 2 19 0 38 m basically for a glacier surface pixel the c band radar signal penetration depth was computed by adding x band radar penetration depth to c x band radar penetration difference as demonstrated in table 2 the calculated c band radar penetration depth is mainly attributed to the c x band radar penetration difference range from 1 80 0 23 m to 2 21 0 20 m over the four study sites however the penetration depth of x band radar signal into ice or snow cannot be simply neglected because it contributes to 17 8 22 5 of the computed c band radar penetration depth 4 2 glacier surface elevation changes the annual rates of glacier surface elevation changes between 2000 and 2018 are exhibited in figs 2 and 3 for the four study sites these results demonstrate that almost all glacier surface pixels containing the accumulation and ablation zones are with a measurement of elevation change it indicates a nearly exhaustive coverage of glacier elevation change observations over the entire glacierized regions of these study sites in previous studies when stereo optical scenes were used to derive glacier elevation changes many data gaps were appeared over the accumulation zone due to lack of image contrast moholdt and kääb 2012 zhou et al 2018b here the nearly thorough observations of glacier elevation changes on the accumulation zone are probably benefited from the high spatial resolution of the used zy3 02 tri stereo images 2 1 m for nadir images and 2 5 m for backward and forward images and the method of dense tri stereo matching basically we can detect more detailed glacier surface features and textures e g small crevasse from the optical images of higher spatial resolution than those of lower spatial resolution moreover the used tri epipolar image generating method is an effective matching technique over the steep and very low texture areas tang et al 2018 the nearly thorough observations are also supported by the altitudinal distributions of glacier elevation changes over the four study sites as shown in fig 4 all the 50 m altitude bands over the glacierized regions have been measured with glacier elevation changes moreover we found that the values of glacier surface thinning over the lower zones are generally larger than those over the higher zones a slight glacier surface lowering or even an increase of ice thickness was detected over the several highest altitude bands of each study site fig 4 the maximum value of glacier surface thickening 0 90 0 55 m yr 1 was measured over the highest altitude band 6450 6500 m of the geladandong study site the height of this altitude band is also the largest for all altitude bands over the four study sites overall we observed the mean glacier elevation changes range from 0 65 0 13 to 0 17 0 05 m yr 1 during the period 2000 2018 over these study sites table 3 4 3 glacier mass balances the estimated glacier mass changes in all the four study sites were negative between 2000 and 2018 the smallest glacier mass loss of 0 14 0 05 m w e yr 1 was observed over the kunlun study site which is located on the northern part of the sryr fig 1 for the three southern study sites glacier mass loss of the geladandong was relatively moderate 0 26 0 07 m w e yr 1 and seriously negative glacier mass changes were measured over the other two study sites of the dongkemadi 0 44 0 10 m w e yr 1 and sedir 0 55 0 12 m w e yr 1 it is noted that an apparent difference in glacier mass balance was detected for the two neighbouring study sites of the geladandong and dongkemadi table 3 as shown in fig 4 this discrepancy is mainly attributed to that glacier accumulation over the upper zones of the geladandong is much more than that of the dongkemadi study site in general the snow and ice melting of glacier tongue regions is similar with each other for the three southern study sites fig 4 therefore over the sedir study site the most negative glacier mass change is mainly caused by the slightest glacier accumulation over the upper zones fig 4 furthermore the main reason of the smallest glacier mass loss over the kunlun is that glacier ablation of the lower zones on this northern study site is much less than that over the three southern study sites 4 4 contribution of glacier mass loss to river runoff as shown in fig 1 not all the snow and ice melt water of the four study sites flows into the sryr for the portion of glacierized regions in the sryr the glacier mass balances of 0 20 0 07 0 45 0 10 0 59 0 13 and 0 23 0 07 m w e yr 1 were estimated over the study sites of the geladandong dongkemadi sedir and kunlun respectively the glacier area of these measured glacierized regions is 1019 4 km2 table 4 which is about 88 of the total glacier area in the sryr the estimated glacier mass balance of the unmeasured glacierized regions was 0 30 0 10 m w e yr 1 by adding the glacier mass budgets of the unmeasured glacierized regions and four study sites table 4 we derived the total glacier mass loss of 0 343 0 055 gt yr 1 for the entire sryr between 2000 and 2018 therefore considering the annual runoff of 17 84 gt yr 1 over the tongtian river the contribution of glacier mass loss to the annual river runoff of the entire sryr was only 1 9 0 3 in the period 2000 2018 moreover based on the assumption that all glacier melting in the sryr occurs between may and october glacier mass loss contributed 2 5 0 4 of the runoff during the flood season 13 79 gt yr 1 since 2000 5 discussion 5 1 influence of radar penetration in glacier mass balance estimates radar penetration depth into glacier surface is an important bias for geodetic glacier mass balance estimates derived from insar dems for the c band radar signal penetration depths range from 1 2 to 9 2 m were measured over various glacier surface zones of the greenland and alaska rignot et al 2001 in the tp and its surroundings the maximum c band radar penetration depth of 5 5 0 3 m was detected over the firn zones of the karakoram kääb et al 2012 here we calculated the c band radar penetration depths of 2 85 0 32 2 57 0 22 2 21 0 21 and 2 19 0 38 m over the study sites of the geladandong dongkemadi sedir and kunlun respectively table 2 taking the whole study period 18 years into account these c band radar penetration depths have caused the biases between 0 10 0 02 and 0 13 0 02 m w e yr 1 which are about 19 71 of our estimated glacier mass balances in general the percentage value is mainly determined by the observed glacier mass loss for the four study sites the maximum percentage 71 was detected over the kunlun study site which experienced the smallest glacier mass loss of 0 14 0 05 m w e yr 1 based on the assumption of no x band radar signal penetration the previous studies regarded the vertical differences between the srtm x dem and the srtm c dem as the penetration depths of c band radar signal gardelle et al 2012a 2013 zhou et al 2018b here we calculated the c band radar penetration depth by adding x band radar penetration depth to c x band radar penetration difference basically our calculated radar penetration depth difference over the gedadandong 2 21 0 20 m is consistent with that in zhou et al 2018b 1 9 m moreover we estimated the x band radar signal penetration depths between 0 39 0 15 and 0 64 0 12 m over the four study sites the systematic biases related to x band radar penetration depth range from 0 02 0 01 to 0 03 0 01 m w e yr 1 contribute to about 3 13 of the observed glacier mass balances therefore the x band radar penetration depth cannot be simply neglected for deriving geodetic estimates of glacier mass balances especially for the glacierized regions with a balanced glacier mass change in addition it is noteworthy that the influence of radar signal penetration depth in geodetic glacier mass balance estimation is related to the integer number of years for the study period fig 5 it indicates that a greater bias can be caused by radar penetration depth for a shorter observation period in summary for glaciers with a slight mass loss or mass gain both the penetration depths of x band and c band radar signals are significant biases in geodetic glacier mass balance estimation especially for a short observation period e g less than 10 years 5 2 comparison with previous studies during the observation period of 2000 2018 no result of glacier mass balance has been published in previous studies over the four study sites for a similar study period 2000 2016 zhang et al 2018 modeled annual glacier mass balance time series of the dongkemadi by applying the albedo based regression method the mean glacier mass loss of 0 54 0 26 m w e yr 1 is generally in agree with our geodetic estimate 0 44 0 10 m w e yr 1 when considering the errors moreover according to field measurements over the xiaodongkemadi glacier an average glacier mass balance of 0 33 m w e yr 1 was derived in 2000 2012 yao et al 2012 zhang et al 2013c the discrepancy between our geodetic estimate and the in situ observations is probably related to the different time periods and the accelerating rate of glacier mass losses in recent years zhang et al 2018 moreover the recent accelerated glacier mass loss may be the major reason for the difference between our estimate 0 26 0 07 m w e yr 1 and the previously published geodetic results over the geladandong study site the glacier mass balances of 0 13 0 06 0 11 0 03 and 0 12 0 22 m w e yr 1 were estimated in the periods of 2003 2009 chao et al 2017 2000 2012 liu et al 2020 and 2000 2014 liu et al 2017 respectively in addition our observed glacier mass balance is generally consistent with the modeled mass changes 0 24 0 10 m w e yr 1 between 2000 and 2016 over the geladandong zhang et al 2018 for the entire sryr we estimated a glacier mass balance of 0 30 0 10 m w e yr 1 between 2000 and 2018 which is generally in line with that of the tanggula mountains 0 38 0 10 m w e yr 1 in 2000 2018 shean et al 2020 and the western nyainqentanglha mountains 0 30 0 19 m w e yr 1 in 2000 2017 ren et al 2020 this similar glacier mass changes may be attributed to that all these glacierized regions are located over the transition zone of mid latitude westerlies and indian summer monsoon yao et al 2013 however glaciers in the interior tibetan mountains which also belong to the transition zone experienced a mass loss of 0 12 0 05 m w e yr 1 in the similar time period shean et al 2020 the relatively stable glacier status is probably related to the limited influence of both westerlies and indian monsoon and the domination of dry and cold continental climatic conditions in the interior area of the tp yao et al 2012 moreover this discrepancy in glacier mass changes is basically supported by that the equilibrium line altitudes of glaciers in the interior tibetan mountains are relatively higher than those of glaciers in the sryr tanggula and western nyainqentanglha mountains yao et al 2012 in this study we found that the contribution of glacier mass loss to the annual river runoff of the sryr was 1 9 0 3 in 2000 2018 which is much less than that reported by liu et al 2009 11 0 in the period 1961 2000 and yao et al 2014 17 5 in the period 1986 2009 although the studied periods are different the discrepancy is probably caused by the overestimation of glacier mass loss in these two previous studies the modeled glacier mass budget of the sryr which was calculated by an empirical function between glacier area and volume was 1 34 gt yr 1 between 1968 and 2002 in liu et al 2009 and 2 02 gt yr 1 between 1986 and 2009 in yao et al 2014 these modeled glacier mass losses are seriously larger than our observed result in the sryr 0 343 0 055 gt yr 1 and even much larger than the observed glacier mass loss 0 5 0 3 gt yr 1 of the whole yangtze river basin in 2000 2016 brun et al 2017 consequently the new geodetic evidence reveals that the contribution of glacier mass loss to the river runoff of the sryr was relatively slight during the past several decades basically for river basins in the tp and its surroundings glacier mass loss is not a major contributor of river runoff or lake water change in an average year zhang et al 2011 lei et al 2013 pritchard 2019 zhou et al 2019 in particular the contribution of glacier melting to river runoff is less than 5 in most river basins around the himalaya mountain range pritchard 2019 however it is difficult to simply infer that glacier melting is not an important water resource for these river basins actually glacier melt water is a significant and reliable buffer against drought in east and south asia pritchard 2019 in a drought year glacier mass loss contributes greater than 50 of the river runoff over most river basins in the tp and its surroundings including many river basins in the himalaya mountain range pritchard 2019 it indicates that glacier melt water is a major contributor of river runoff during a drought year but over the sryr the contribution of glacier melting to river runoff is still uncertain for the drought years due to paucity of annual glacier mass balance measurements 5 3 acceleration of glacier mass loss in the sryr in this study we derived the glacier mass loss of 0 30 0 10 m w e yr 1 0 343 0 055 gt yr 1 between 2000 and 2018 in the sryr as reported by shi et al 2005 the total ice volume is approximately 88 75 gt for this river basin therefore if the mass loss rate is constant in the future glacier melt water will be a reliable fresh water supply in the next two centuries compared to previously published results our estimated glacier mass change of the geladandong mountain in 2000 2018 0 26 0 07 m w e yr 1 is basically consistent with that in 1976 2000 0 22 0 12 m w e yr 1 in zhou et al 2018b however the glacier mass balance of xiaodongkemadi glacier was 0 11 m w e yr 1 between 1989 and 2000 yao et al 2012 which is much less negative than our estimation in 2000 2018 0 44 0 10 m w e yr 1 it indicates a possible acceleration of glacier mass loss over this glacier during the past several decades in recent years the accelerated glacier mass loss was detected over both the geladandong mountain liu et al 2020 and xiaodongkemadi glacier zhang et al 2018 specifically glacier mass loss of the geladandong mountain in 2012 2018 0 47 0 09 m w e yr 1 was about three times larger than that in 2000 2012 0 11 0 03 m w e yr 1 liu et al 2020 glacier mass change of the xiaodongkemadi glacier in 2012 2016 0 91 0 10 m w e yr 1 was much more negative than that in 2000 2012 0 38 0 08 m w e yr 1 zhang et al 2018 furthermore it is noteworthy that this recent accelerated glacier mass loss was also detected over some glaciers in the interior tp liu et al 2019 the pamir mountains lambrecht et al 2018 and the southeast tp wu et al 2018 however considering the heterogeneous responses of glaciers to regional climate variations kääb et al 2012 yao et al 2012 brun et al 2017 shean et al 2020 we cannot infer that this accelerating rate of negative mass changes is generalized to other glaciers in the tp and its surroundings even for the sryr the existence of a regionally accelerated glacier mass loss in recent years remains unknown due to lack of investigations about temporal variations of glacier mass balances in the southeast and north regions 5 4 impact of regional climate variations in general glacier accumulation and ablation are affected by the changes in snowfall and air temperature respectively zhang et al 2013a huintjes et al 2015 li et al 2018 over the four study sites an apparent increase of mean air temperature was detected for the summer season fig 6 a and between may and september fig 6b in 1979 2018 this climate warming trend probably attributed to an accelerated glacier melting between 2000 and 2018 moreover we found a pronounced decrease of total snowfall in summer months fig 7 a and annual snowfall fig 7b during the period of 1979 2018 this means that the glacier material for accumulation has been probably reduced since 2000 consequently the observed glacier mass losses of all these four study sites are probably caused by both the increase of air temperature and the decrease of snowfall glacier mass balances of the four study sites were spatially heterogeneous in 2000 2018 which may be mainly related to the spatial difference in snowfall variations rather than climate warming as shown in fig 7 the decrease of snowfall over the kunlun with the smallest glacier mass loss of 0 14 0 05 m w e yr 1 is much less than those over other three study sites moreover for the two neighbouring study sites of the geladandong and dongkemadi the snowfall decrease of the geladandong glacier mass loss of 0 26 0 07 m w e yr 1 is also less than that of the dongkemadi glacier mass loss of 0 44 0 10 m w e yr 1 however the increases of air temperature were similar with each other for the four study sites between 1979 and 2018 fig 6 furthermore since the transfer of snow and ice from the upper zones to the lower zones with glacier flow it is noteworthy that the least decrease of snowfall cannot be simply equivalent to that glacier accumulation over the upper regions of the kunlun is more than that of the three southern study sites under the similar climate warming of the four study sites the observed smallest ablation over the lower zones of the kunlun fig 4 is probably related to the fastest transfer of glacier material which could compensate the glacier mass losses induced by snow and ice melting on the lower regions 6 conclusions in this study the glacier mass balance of the sryr in 2000 2018 was investigated by using the srtm c dem and the glacier surface topographic data generated from zy3 tri stereo images according to the mountain glacier distribution we selected four study sites as the geladandong dongkemadi sedir and kunlun in the sryr by comparing the srtm c dem and the generated zy3 dems glacier mass balances range from 0 55 0 12 to 0 14 0 05 m w e yr 1 were estimated for the four study sites in 2000 2018 the smallest negative glacier mass change was observed over the northern study site kunlun whereas the three southern study sites experienced relatively moderate geladandong and serious dongkemadi and sedir glacier mass loss the observed heterogeneous glacier mass balances may be mainly attributed to the spatial difference in snowfall variations rather than air temperature increase overall for all glaciers in the sryr we derived the glacier mass budget of 0 343 0 055 gt yr 1 between 2000 and 2018 the river runoff of the sryr has been observed by the zhimenda hydrological station which was installed at the downstream of the tongtian river in july 1956 during the period 2000 2018 we calculated the annual runoff of 17 84 gt yr 1 therefore the contribution of glacier mass loss to the river runoff of the sryr was only 1 9 0 3 in the period 2000 2018 this indicates that glacier melting was not a major contributor to the water resource in the sryr during recent decades by taking into consideration of the total ice volume of the sryr 88 75 gt in shi et al 2005 if the glacier mass loss rate 0 343 0 055 gt yr 1 is not changed in the future glacier melting will continuously supply fresh water for the next two centuries however an accelerated glacier mass loss during recent years was detected over several glacierized regions in the sryr such as the geladandong mountain liu et al 2020 and xiaodongkemadi glacier zhang et al 2018 the investigations about recent temporal variations of mass balances over other glaciers in the sryr are needed to fully understand whether the accelerated glacier mass loss is a regional tendency credit authorship contribution statement lin liu methodology formal analysis visualization writing original

5272,with rapid climatic warming glaciers in the source region of the yangtze river sryr generally experienced apparent terminus retreats over the past several decades however the influence of glacier melting in the river runoff of the sryr remains poorly known due to lack of glacier mass balance measurements in this study we derived the glacier mass changes of the sryr in 2000 2018 by comparing the digital elevation models dems produced from ziyuan 3 tri stereo scenes with the srtm dem glacier mass balances were spatially heterogeneous range from 0 55 0 12 to 0 14 0 05 m w e yr 1 in the sryr which may be mainly attributed to the spatial difference in snowfall variation overall the glacier mass loss of 0 343 0 055 gt yr 1 was estimated for the entire sryr by using the hydrological data recorded by the zhimenda station we calculated the annual runoff of 17 84 gt yr 1 between 2000 and 2018 therefore the contribution of glacier mass loss to the river runoff of the sryr was only 1 9 0 3 in 2000 2018 our results reveal that glacier melting was not the major water resource in the sryr during recent decades keywords glacier mass loss river runoff the source region of the yangtze river tibetan plateau ziyuan 3 1 introduction the source region of the yangtze river sryr with an area of 1 4 105 km2 covers about 17 of the entire yangtze river basin yao et al 2014 li et al 2017 furthermore the runoff of rivers in the sryr which are generally originated from mountain glaciers provides approximately 20 of the total river discharge of the yangtze river mao et al 2016 thus the river runoff of the sryr is a significant fresh water resource for hundreds of millions of people live in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin yang et al 2007 during recent decades the sryr experienced an apparent air temperature increase of 0 6 c per decade which is about four times that of global mean kang et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 for this rapid climatic warming a pronounced terminus retreat was observed for most glaciers in the sryr zhang et al 2008 2013b yao et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 ke et al 2017 however the measurement of glacier mass balance which is the key indicator of glacier status was scarce in the sryr consequently an accurate estimation of glacier mass change and its contribution to river runoff is urgently needed in the sryr for investigating the variations of water resource in the yangtze river basin for estimating regional glacier mass change field measurements are usually used to extrapolate to the rest glacierized zones with no observations meier et al 2007 cogley 2009 although a few of field measurements of glacier mass balances have been conducted in the tibetan plateau tp for many years yao et al 2012 this extrapolation method suffers from the paucity of in situ observations yao et al 2012 and the spatially heterogeneous glacier mass balance in the tp kääb et al 2012 brun et al 2017 shean et al 2020 specifically in the sryr field measurements of glacier mass balances were only conducted over the xiaodongkemadi glacier between 1989 and 2010 mean glacier mass loss of 0 24 m w e yr 1 was observed for this glacier yao et al 2012 according to the second chinese glacier inventory scgi the number of glaciers is approximately 900 in the sryr guo et al 2015 taking the heterogeneous glacier mass change into consideration this in situ observation cannot be simply extrapolated to the whole glacierized regions of the sryr in addition an empirical function between glacier area and volume was applied to monitor glacier mass balance of the entire sryr liu et al 2009 yao et al 2014 according to the changes of glacierized area liu et al 2009 and yao et al 2014 detected that glacier mass balance of the sryr was about 1 05 and 1 71 m w e yr 1 during the periods of 1961 2000 and 1986 2009 respectively however a pronounced overestimation of glacier mass loss was reported by comparing with the observed mass balances of glaciers in the himalayan mountain range in the similar period bolch et al 2011 zhou et al 2018b the glacier mass loss of 0 32 0 08 m w e yr 1 was estimated for the everest area between 1970 and 2007 bolch et al 2011 and the measured glacier mass loss was 0 30 0 12 m w e yr 1 over the sikkim in 1975 2000 zhou et al 2018b in general during a similar period glaciers in the tanggula mountains and east kunlun mountains lost less mass than those in the monsoon dominated regions gardner et al 2013 brun et al 2017 shean et al 2020 because of the limited influence of indian summer monsoon yao et al 2012 consequently these overestimated glacier mass losses probably result in an overestimation about the contribution of glacier mass loss to river runoff in the sryr in recent years the geodetic method has been widely used to estimate glacier mass changes in the tp and its surroundings due to the rapid development of satellite remote sensing berthier et al 2007 bolch et al 2011 kääb et al 2012 gardelle et al 2013 zhou et al 2018b liu et al 2019 however large scale detailed observations of glacier mass balance over the entire sryr are still scarce and a few recent studies focused on the geladandong mountain and dongkemadi both of which are located on the southwest region of the sryr based on icesat laser altimetry data the glacier mass losses of 0 13 and 0 48 m w e yr 1 in the period 2003 2008 were observed for the geladandong mountain chao et al 2017 and dongkemadi ke et al 2017 respectively by comparing the digital elevation models dems in different times the glacier mass balances of 0 12 0 22 m w e yr 1 in 2000 2014 liu et al 2017 and 0 11 0 03 m w e yr 1 in 2000 2012 liu et al 2020 were estimated over the geladandong mountain these previous studies revealed that the glacier mass loss of dongkemadi was much more than that of galadandong mountain in the first decade of the 21st century this infers that the existing local field measurements and geodetic estimations are probably not representative of the whole glacierized regions of the sryr due to heterogeneous glacier mass balance in this study we aimed to accurately estimate glacier mass balance with the geodetic method over the entire sryr and evaluate its contribution to river runoff during recent decades for better coverage of the glacierized regions the c band srtm srtm c dem was used as a reference topographic data the recent glacier surface dems were generated with 13 pairs of ziyuan 3 zy3 tri stereo optical images the possible systematic biases of radar penetration depths and seasonal glacier mass changes were corrected for an accurate estimation of glacier mass balances moreover by comparing the observed glacier mass change and hydrological data in the same period we assessed the contribution of glacier mass loss to river runoff in the sryr in addition we analyzed the impact of regional climate variations with respect to glacier mass balance 2 description of study area the sryr is located at the middle eastern part of the tp between the kunlun mountain range and the tanggula mountain range fig 1 the spatial pattern of annual precipitation range from 280 mm to 480 mm is generally determined by the topography yao et al 2014 the daily average air temperature of higher than 5 c was detected over most of the basin in the summer months over the past several decades the climate warming trend was recorded by an ice core drilled on the upper zone of the guoqu glacier in the past 500 years zhang et al 2016 as exhibited in fig 1 the glacierized regions of the sryr are mainly distributed at the northern slop of the tanggula mountain range moreover some glaciers are existing over the northern slop of the sedir mountain and the southern slop of the kunlun mountain range here four study sites two in the tanggula mountain range one in the sedir mountain and one in the kunlun mountain range were selected for estimating glacier mass balance of the sryr mountain glaciers over the four study sites are belong to summer accumulation type because snowfall mainly occurs between june and august maussion et al 2014 snow and ice melt water of glaciers in the sryr flows into the main stream of the tongtian river by several tributaries river runoff has been continuously observed for more than half a century by the zhimenda hydrological station which was built up at the downstream of the tongtian river in july 1956 during the past decades the average annual runoff of the tongtian river was 15 79 gt yr 1 with a pronounced inter decade variation luo et al 2019 the maximum value of 18 09 gt yr 1 was observed in the 2000s and the minimum value of 13 37 gt yr 1 was recorded in the 1990s luo et al 2019 3 data and methods 3 1 ziyuan 3 images and dem generation two space borne dems were used to observe glacier elevation changes over the four study sites the more recent dems were produced from zy3 tri stereo optical images the zy3 satellite series are the first civilian high resolution stereo mapping satellites of china pan et al 2013 until now two zy3 satellites 01 and 02 have been launched in the sun synchronous orbit with a height of about 506 km and 180 degrees phase apart pan et al 2016 both the two satellites were equipped with three panchromatic cameras for linear push broom imaging in three directions of forward backward and nadir tang et al 2013 pan et al 2016 the main parameters of three panchromatic cameras in the zy3 02 satellite are the same as those in the zy3 01 satellite except an improvement in the spatial resolution of forward and backward cameras from 3 5 m to 2 5 m xu et al 2017 in this study we employed 13 pairs of zy3 02 tri stereo scenes acquired between december 2016 and february 2018 to generate the recent glacier surface dems over the four study sites table 1 the coverage of these optical images is shown as dark red rectangles in fig 1 it is noteworthy that the threshold value of cloud cover was set to 10 for minimizing data gaps because the void areas in the reconstructed dems are mainly caused by cloud cover in the used tri stereo optical images the zy3 dems were produced by space data processor sdp software from the land satellite remote sensing application center ministry of natural resources of the people s republic of china here the process of dense tri stereo matching was conducted by using the tri epipolar image generating method for a reliable matching in the steep and very low texture areas tang et al 2018 in the sryr no ground control point gcp is available for dem generation due to the remote location basically without gcp the vertical accuracy of the generated zy3 topographic data is approximately 6 10 m fratarcangeli et al 2016 zhou et al 2018a data gaps attributed to cloud cover in the used optical images were not filled by any interpolation 3 2 srtm dem and radar penetration correction the glacier surface dem derived from the shuttle radar topography mission was used as the reference topographic data in february 2000 two interferometric sar systems were equipped on the srtm mission with different frequency c band and x band rabus et al 2003 here we used the srtm c dem for better coverage of the glacierized regions over the four study sites because the x band radar in the srtm srtm x was operated to acquire data along discrete 50 km wide swaths rabus et al 2003 the penetration depth of c band radar signal into snow or ice is needed to be firstly corrected for detecting glacier elevation changes with the srtm c dem gardelle et al 2012a in the glacierized regions of the tp and its surroundings based on the simply no x band penetration assumption gardelle et al 2012a the c band radar penetration depths are typically determined by the elevation differences between the x band and c band srtm dems gardelle et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 cao et al 2019 however a non negligible x band radar penetration depth in winter season was detected in the pamir mountains lambrecht et al 2018 and the inner tp liu et al 2019 in this study the correction value of c band radar penetration depth was estimated by adding x band radar penetration depth to c x band radar penetration difference specifically we employed the polynomial function between x band radar penetration depth and altitude over the puruogangri ice field inner tp liu et al 2019 moreover we also calculated the difference of c x band radar penetration depth as a polynomial function of altitude by comparing the srtm c dem with the srtm x dem both the corrections of x band radar penetration depth and c x band radar penetration difference were applied to each glacier surface pixel of the four study sites separately 3 3 dem co registration and differencing we subtracted the corrected srtm c dem from the generated zy3 dems to derive glacier elevation changes over the four study sites as listed in table 1 most of the used zy3 02 tri stereo optical images were acquired in december 2017 and january and february 2018 therefore we assumed that the observed results could represent the mean glacier elevation changes in the period of 2000 2018 based on a neglect of the possible inter annual variation before the process of dem differencing the vertical discrepancy attributed to the horizontal deviation between the two used dems is needed to be eliminated firstly berthier et al 2007 in this study we employed the universal co registration method suggested by nuth and kaab 2011 to accurately match all the pairs of the used dems moreover each zy3 dem was compared to its corresponding srtm c dem to observe elevation changes separately glacier surface elevation changes were detected by masking the results of dem differencing with the glacier boundaries obtained from the scgi as shown in fig 1 in general the scgi glacier outlines were delineated with the landsat optical images collected between 2006 and 2010 guo et al 2015 here in order to derive glacier elevation changes since 2000 terminus locations of non surge glaciers over the four study sites were manually corrected with cloud free landsat scenes in 1999 or 2000 we used the landsat optical images in 1999 because of no available data acquired in 2000 over some glacierized regions moreover we updated the terminus locations of surge type glaciers with the landsat scenes obtained in the similar date of the used zy3 02 scenes for the results of dem differencing in the glacierized regions we removed the bias caused by the different spatial resolution of the two used dems with a polynomial function between elevation difference and altitude over the off glacier regions furthermore similar with that in liu et al 2016 the glacier surface pixels with a slope angle of greater than 25 degrees were excluded before calculating mean glacier elevation change in addition the threshold of 150 m which was determined by investigating previous studies in these glacierized regions was used to identify the outliers of the observed elevation changes over non surge glaciers the threshold of glacier elevation changes was set to 200 m for surge type glaciers like the generation of zy3 dems we also did not fill the void zones for all the measured results of glacier elevation changes 3 4 glacier mass balance estimation and uncertainty analysis glacier mass balances of the four study sites were estimated from mean glacier elevation changes by using the conversion factor of 850 kg m 3 proposed by huss 2013 in general for a glacierized region the elevation changes of all the glacier pixels over an altitude band are subject to the gaussian distribution berthier et al 2004 gardelle et al 2012b therefore we calculated the mean glacier elevation change of every study site for 50 m altitude bands moreover over an altitude interval the threshold of three standard deviations was used to minimize the impact of random errors in the calculated mean value note mean glacier elevation change was separately calculated over each surge type glacier because the altitudinal distributions of the glacier elevation changes of surge type glaciers are always different from each other gardelle et al 2013 in order to estimate the annual rate of glacier mass balance seasonal glacier mass change is a possible systematic bias here the c band srtm radar images were acquired in february whereas most of the zy3 02 tri stereo scenes were collected in december and january table 1 thus we needed to correct the systematic bias of seasonal glacier mass changes of 1 2 months in winter however both the accumulation and ablation of summer accumulation glaciers mainly occur in the summer season consequently no seasonal glacier mass change in the winter months was needed to be corrected for all glaciers over the four study sites overall the estimation of glacier mass balance δ b over each study site can be summarized by the following equation 1 δ b δ h p x δ p x c ρ glac t ρ w where δ h p x and δ p x c are the mean value of glacier elevation change the penetration depth of x band radar signal and c x band radar penetration depth difference respectively t is the integer number of years for the study period ρ glac 850 kg m 3 is conversion factor and ρ w 1000 kg m 3 is the density of water 2 δ h δ h i s i s total where s i and δ h i are glacier area and mean glacier elevation change over an altitude band respectively s total is the total area of the glacierized regions over a study site as shown in fig 1 not all the glacierized regions of the four study sites are located in the sryr in order to assess the contribution of glacier mass loss to the runoff of the sryr we excluded the glaciers without the sryr the glacier mass balance of the entire sryr was calculated as the area weighted average of the geodetic glacier mass balance estimates over the four study sites the area which was applied as the weight is the glacier area of the portion of glacierized regions in the sryr for each study site moreover the mass balance of the unmeasured glaciers was assumed to be equal to that of the entire sryr we assessed the uncertainty of glacier mass balance in the entire sryr by employing the errors of the derived glacier mass balances over the four study sites based on the standard law of error propagation the uncertainty of glacier mass balance σ δ b over a study site is mainly originated from the errors of mean glacier elevation change x band radar penetration depth c x band radar penetration depth difference and conversion factor 3 σ δ b δ h p x δ p x c 2 σ ρ glac 2 σ δ h 2 σ p x 2 σ δ p x c 2 ρ glac 2 t ρ w where σ ρ glac is the error of conversion factor huss 2013 suggested that σ ρ glac 60 kg m 3 is approximately 7 of conversion factor σ p x and σ δ p x c are the errors of x band radar penetration depth and c x band radar penetration depth difference respectively here we assumed that the two errors were equal to their corresponding standard deviations because both the correction values were calculated as a polynomial function of altitude and applied to each glacier surface pixel separately moreover σδh is the error of mean glacier elevation change over a study site 4 σ δ h σ δ h i 2 s i 2 s total 2 δ h 2 σ s total 2 s total 2 where σ s total is the error of total glacier area over a study site in this study glacier terminus locations were manually modified with landsat optical scenes we thus assumed an uncertainty of 5 for the total glacier area paul et al 2013 σ δ h i is the statistic error of the observed glacier elevation change over an altitude band 5 σ δ h i std v i n ef f i where std v i and n ef f i are the standard deviation of mean glacier elevation change and the number of independent pixels respectively 6 n ef f i n i p s 2 d sp where n i is the number of glacier pixels over an altitude band ps is the spatial resolution of the used dems d sp is the distance of spatial autocorrelation here this distance was calculated with the semivariogram model the uncertainty of glacier mass balance estimation over the unmeasured glacierized regions was assumed to be twice that of the entire sryr 3 5 river runoff calculation the melt water of mountain glaciers in the sryr flows into the main stream of the tongtian river by several tributaries fig 1 two hydrological stations have been installed in the sryr for recording river runoff the tuotuohe station is at the downstream of the tuotuo river and the zhimenda station is at the downstream of the tongtian river the tuotuo river is one of the tributaries of the tongtian river therefore in order to evaluate the contribution of glacier mass loss to annual river runoff of the entire sryr we employed the hydrological data of the tongtian river during the 2000s and 2010s the annual runoffs of 18 09 and 17 54 gt yr 1 were recorded by the zhimenda station respectively luo et al 2019 we thus computed a mean value of 17 84 gt yr 1 for the annual river runoffs of the tongtian river between 2000 and 2018 furthermore considering that snow and ice melting of glaciers in the sryr mainly occurs in the summer months maussion et al 2014 we estimated the contribution of glacier mass loss to river runoff during the flood season between may and october based on the recorded runoffs in the 2000s 13 96 gt yr 1 and 2010s 13 58 gt yr 1 luo et al 2019 the mean runoff of 13 79 gt yr 1 was calculated for the flood season of the tongtian river in 2000 2018 3 6 climatic data and decade trend analysis glacier mass balance is a direct indicator of glacier s response to regional climate changes wgms 2008 ipcc 2013 in general glacial material for accumulation is mainly provided by snowfall and glacier ablation caused by ice or snow melting is affected by air temperature zhang et al 2013a huintjes et al 2015 li et al 2018 here in order to assess the impact of regional climate changes on glacier mass balances of the four study sites we employed the snowfall and 2 m air temperature records between 1979 and 2018 obtained from the era 5 reanalysis data for mountain glaciers over these study sites summer accumulation type both the accumulation and ablation concentrate on the summer months we thus estimated the decade trends of total summer snowfall and mean summer air temperature in 1979 2018 the temporal trends of climate changes were estimated by using the method of linear regression analysis the decade trend was computed as twelve times the first order coefficient of the regression equation moreover the decade trend of annual snowfall was assessed in this study for the reason that the snowfall in other seasons of the year may be a supply of glacial material in addition we also analyzed the trend of mean air temperature between may and september because glacier melting may occur in may and september due to relatively high air temperature 4 results 4 1 radar penetration depth table 2 lists the mean values of c band radar signal penetration depths over the four study sites in general we detected a c band radar penetration depth of greater than 2 1 m for all the four study sites and the maximum correction of 2 85 0 32 m over the geladandong the penetration depth of c band radar signal into glacier surface is 2 57 0 22 m on the dongkemadi study site the c band radar penetration depth over the sedir 2 21 0 21 m is relatively small and similar with that over the kunlun study site 2 19 0 38 m basically for a glacier surface pixel the c band radar signal penetration depth was computed by adding x band radar penetration depth to c x band radar penetration difference as demonstrated in table 2 the calculated c band radar penetration depth is mainly attributed to the c x band radar penetration difference range from 1 80 0 23 m to 2 21 0 20 m over the four study sites however the penetration depth of x band radar signal into ice or snow cannot be simply neglected because it contributes to 17 8 22 5 of the computed c band radar penetration depth 4 2 glacier surface elevation changes the annual rates of glacier surface elevation changes between 2000 and 2018 are exhibited in figs 2 and 3 for the four study sites these results demonstrate that almost all glacier surface pixels containing the accumulation and ablation zones are with a measurement of elevation change it indicates a nearly exhaustive coverage of glacier elevation change observations over the entire glacierized regions of these study sites in previous studies when stereo optical scenes were used to derive glacier elevation changes many data gaps were appeared over the accumulation zone due to lack of image contrast moholdt and kääb 2012 zhou et al 2018b here the nearly thorough observations of glacier elevation changes on the accumulation zone are probably benefited from the high spatial resolution of the used zy3 02 tri stereo images 2 1 m for nadir images and 2 5 m for backward and forward images and the method of dense tri stereo matching basically we can detect more detailed glacier surface features and textures e g small crevasse from the optical images of higher spatial resolution than those of lower spatial resolution moreover the used tri epipolar image generating method is an effective matching technique over the steep and very low texture areas tang et al 2018 the nearly thorough observations are also supported by the altitudinal distributions of glacier elevation changes over the four study sites as shown in fig 4 all the 50 m altitude bands over the glacierized regions have been measured with glacier elevation changes moreover we found that the values of glacier surface thinning over the lower zones are generally larger than those over the higher zones a slight glacier surface lowering or even an increase of ice thickness was detected over the several highest altitude bands of each study site fig 4 the maximum value of glacier surface thickening 0 90 0 55 m yr 1 was measured over the highest altitude band 6450 6500 m of the geladandong study site the height of this altitude band is also the largest for all altitude bands over the four study sites overall we observed the mean glacier elevation changes range from 0 65 0 13 to 0 17 0 05 m yr 1 during the period 2000 2018 over these study sites table 3 4 3 glacier mass balances the estimated glacier mass changes in all the four study sites were negative between 2000 and 2018 the smallest glacier mass loss of 0 14 0 05 m w e yr 1 was observed over the kunlun study site which is located on the northern part of the sryr fig 1 for the three southern study sites glacier mass loss of the geladandong was relatively moderate 0 26 0 07 m w e yr 1 and seriously negative glacier mass changes were measured over the other two study sites of the dongkemadi 0 44 0 10 m w e yr 1 and sedir 0 55 0 12 m w e yr 1 it is noted that an apparent difference in glacier mass balance was detected for the two neighbouring study sites of the geladandong and dongkemadi table 3 as shown in fig 4 this discrepancy is mainly attributed to that glacier accumulation over the upper zones of the geladandong is much more than that of the dongkemadi study site in general the snow and ice melting of glacier tongue regions is similar with each other for the three southern study sites fig 4 therefore over the sedir study site the most negative glacier mass change is mainly caused by the slightest glacier accumulation over the upper zones fig 4 furthermore the main reason of the smallest glacier mass loss over the kunlun is that glacier ablation of the lower zones on this northern study site is much less than that over the three southern study sites 4 4 contribution of glacier mass loss to river runoff as shown in fig 1 not all the snow and ice melt water of the four study sites flows into the sryr for the portion of glacierized regions in the sryr the glacier mass balances of 0 20 0 07 0 45 0 10 0 59 0 13 and 0 23 0 07 m w e yr 1 were estimated over the study sites of the geladandong dongkemadi sedir and kunlun respectively the glacier area of these measured glacierized regions is 1019 4 km2 table 4 which is about 88 of the total glacier area in the sryr the estimated glacier mass balance of the unmeasured glacierized regions was 0 30 0 10 m w e yr 1 by adding the glacier mass budgets of the unmeasured glacierized regions and four study sites table 4 we derived the total glacier mass loss of 0 343 0 055 gt yr 1 for the entire sryr between 2000 and 2018 therefore considering the annual runoff of 17 84 gt yr 1 over the tongtian river the contribution of glacier mass loss to the annual river runoff of the entire sryr was only 1 9 0 3 in the period 2000 2018 moreover based on the assumption that all glacier melting in the sryr occurs between may and october glacier mass loss contributed 2 5 0 4 of the runoff during the flood season 13 79 gt yr 1 since 2000 5 discussion 5 1 influence of radar penetration in glacier mass balance estimates radar penetration depth into glacier surface is an important bias for geodetic glacier mass balance estimates derived from insar dems for the c band radar signal penetration depths range from 1 2 to 9 2 m were measured over various glacier surface zones of the greenland and alaska rignot et al 2001 in the tp and its surroundings the maximum c band radar penetration depth of 5 5 0 3 m was detected over the firn zones of the karakoram kääb et al 2012 here we calculated the c band radar penetration depths of 2 85 0 32 2 57 0 22 2 21 0 21 and 2 19 0 38 m over the study sites of the geladandong dongkemadi sedir and kunlun respectively table 2 taking the whole study period 18 years into account these c band radar penetration depths have caused the biases between 0 10 0 02 and 0 13 0 02 m w e yr 1 which are about 19 71 of our estimated glacier mass balances in general the percentage value is mainly determined by the observed glacier mass loss for the four study sites the maximum percentage 71 was detected over the kunlun study site which experienced the smallest glacier mass loss of 0 14 0 05 m w e yr 1 based on the assumption of no x band radar signal penetration the previous studies regarded the vertical differences between the srtm x dem and the srtm c dem as the penetration depths of c band radar signal gardelle et al 2012a 2013 zhou et al 2018b here we calculated the c band radar penetration depth by adding x band radar penetration depth to c x band radar penetration difference basically our calculated radar penetration depth difference over the gedadandong 2 21 0 20 m is consistent with that in zhou et al 2018b 1 9 m moreover we estimated the x band radar signal penetration depths between 0 39 0 15 and 0 64 0 12 m over the four study sites the systematic biases related to x band radar penetration depth range from 0 02 0 01 to 0 03 0 01 m w e yr 1 contribute to about 3 13 of the observed glacier mass balances therefore the x band radar penetration depth cannot be simply neglected for deriving geodetic estimates of glacier mass balances especially for the glacierized regions with a balanced glacier mass change in addition it is noteworthy that the influence of radar signal penetration depth in geodetic glacier mass balance estimation is related to the integer number of years for the study period fig 5 it indicates that a greater bias can be caused by radar penetration depth for a shorter observation period in summary for glaciers with a slight mass loss or mass gain both the penetration depths of x band and c band radar signals are significant biases in geodetic glacier mass balance estimation especially for a short observation period e g less than 10 years 5 2 comparison with previous studies during the observation period of 2000 2018 no result of glacier mass balance has been published in previous studies over the four study sites for a similar study period 2000 2016 zhang et al 2018 modeled annual glacier mass balance time series of the dongkemadi by applying the albedo based regression method the mean glacier mass loss of 0 54 0 26 m w e yr 1 is generally in agree with our geodetic estimate 0 44 0 10 m w e yr 1 when considering the errors moreover according to field measurements over the xiaodongkemadi glacier an average glacier mass balance of 0 33 m w e yr 1 was derived in 2000 2012 yao et al 2012 zhang et al 2013c the discrepancy between our geodetic estimate and the in situ observations is probably related to the different time periods and the accelerating rate of glacier mass losses in recent years zhang et al 2018 moreover the recent accelerated glacier mass loss may be the major reason for the difference between our estimate 0 26 0 07 m w e yr 1 and the previously published geodetic results over the geladandong study site the glacier mass balances of 0 13 0 06 0 11 0 03 and 0 12 0 22 m w e yr 1 were estimated in the periods of 2003 2009 chao et al 2017 2000 2012 liu et al 2020 and 2000 2014 liu et al 2017 respectively in addition our observed glacier mass balance is generally consistent with the modeled mass changes 0 24 0 10 m w e yr 1 between 2000 and 2016 over the geladandong zhang et al 2018 for the entire sryr we estimated a glacier mass balance of 0 30 0 10 m w e yr 1 between 2000 and 2018 which is generally in line with that of the tanggula mountains 0 38 0 10 m w e yr 1 in 2000 2018 shean et al 2020 and the western nyainqentanglha mountains 0 30 0 19 m w e yr 1 in 2000 2017 ren et al 2020 this similar glacier mass changes may be attributed to that all these glacierized regions are located over the transition zone of mid latitude westerlies and indian summer monsoon yao et al 2013 however glaciers in the interior tibetan mountains which also belong to the transition zone experienced a mass loss of 0 12 0 05 m w e yr 1 in the similar time period shean et al 2020 the relatively stable glacier status is probably related to the limited influence of both westerlies and indian monsoon and the domination of dry and cold continental climatic conditions in the interior area of the tp yao et al 2012 moreover this discrepancy in glacier mass changes is basically supported by that the equilibrium line altitudes of glaciers in the interior tibetan mountains are relatively higher than those of glaciers in the sryr tanggula and western nyainqentanglha mountains yao et al 2012 in this study we found that the contribution of glacier mass loss to the annual river runoff of the sryr was 1 9 0 3 in 2000 2018 which is much less than that reported by liu et al 2009 11 0 in the period 1961 2000 and yao et al 2014 17 5 in the period 1986 2009 although the studied periods are different the discrepancy is probably caused by the overestimation of glacier mass loss in these two previous studies the modeled glacier mass budget of the sryr which was calculated by an empirical function between glacier area and volume was 1 34 gt yr 1 between 1968 and 2002 in liu et al 2009 and 2 02 gt yr 1 between 1986 and 2009 in yao et al 2014 these modeled glacier mass losses are seriously larger than our observed result in the sryr 0 343 0 055 gt yr 1 and even much larger than the observed glacier mass loss 0 5 0 3 gt yr 1 of the whole yangtze river basin in 2000 2016 brun et al 2017 consequently the new geodetic evidence reveals that the contribution of glacier mass loss to the river runoff of the sryr was relatively slight during the past several decades basically for river basins in the tp and its surroundings glacier mass loss is not a major contributor of river runoff or lake water change in an average year zhang et al 2011 lei et al 2013 pritchard 2019 zhou et al 2019 in particular the contribution of glacier melting to river runoff is less than 5 in most river basins around the himalaya mountain range pritchard 2019 however it is difficult to simply infer that glacier melting is not an important water resource for these river basins actually glacier melt water is a significant and reliable buffer against drought in east and south asia pritchard 2019 in a drought year glacier mass loss contributes greater than 50 of the river runoff over most river basins in the tp and its surroundings including many river basins in the himalaya mountain range pritchard 2019 it indicates that glacier melt water is a major contributor of river runoff during a drought year but over the sryr the contribution of glacier melting to river runoff is still uncertain for the drought years due to paucity of annual glacier mass balance measurements 5 3 acceleration of glacier mass loss in the sryr in this study we derived the glacier mass loss of 0 30 0 10 m w e yr 1 0 343 0 055 gt yr 1 between 2000 and 2018 in the sryr as reported by shi et al 2005 the total ice volume is approximately 88 75 gt for this river basin therefore if the mass loss rate is constant in the future glacier melt water will be a reliable fresh water supply in the next two centuries compared to previously published results our estimated glacier mass change of the geladandong mountain in 2000 2018 0 26 0 07 m w e yr 1 is basically consistent with that in 1976 2000 0 22 0 12 m w e yr 1 in zhou et al 2018b however the glacier mass balance of xiaodongkemadi glacier was 0 11 m w e yr 1 between 1989 and 2000 yao et al 2012 which is much less negative than our estimation in 2000 2018 0 44 0 10 m w e yr 1 it indicates a possible acceleration of glacier mass loss over this glacier during the past several decades in recent years the accelerated glacier mass loss was detected over both the geladandong mountain liu et al 2020 and xiaodongkemadi glacier zhang et al 2018 specifically glacier mass loss of the geladandong mountain in 2012 2018 0 47 0 09 m w e yr 1 was about three times larger than that in 2000 2012 0 11 0 03 m w e yr 1 liu et al 2020 glacier mass change of the xiaodongkemadi glacier in 2012 2016 0 91 0 10 m w e yr 1 was much more negative than that in 2000 2012 0 38 0 08 m w e yr 1 zhang et al 2018 furthermore it is noteworthy that this recent accelerated glacier mass loss was also detected over some glaciers in the interior tp liu et al 2019 the pamir mountains lambrecht et al 2018 and the southeast tp wu et al 2018 however considering the heterogeneous responses of glaciers to regional climate variations kääb et al 2012 yao et al 2012 brun et al 2017 shean et al 2020 we cannot infer that this accelerating rate of negative mass changes is generalized to other glaciers in the tp and its surroundings even for the sryr the existence of a regionally accelerated glacier mass loss in recent years remains unknown due to lack of investigations about temporal variations of glacier mass balances in the southeast and north regions 5 4 impact of regional climate variations in general glacier accumulation and ablation are affected by the changes in snowfall and air temperature respectively zhang et al 2013a huintjes et al 2015 li et al 2018 over the four study sites an apparent increase of mean air temperature was detected for the summer season fig 6 a and between may and september fig 6b in 1979 2018 this climate warming trend probably attributed to an accelerated glacier melting between 2000 and 2018 moreover we found a pronounced decrease of total snowfall in summer months fig 7 a and annual snowfall fig 7b during the period of 1979 2018 this means that the glacier material for accumulation has been probably reduced since 2000 consequently the observed glacier mass losses of all these four study sites are probably caused by both the increase of air temperature and the decrease of snowfall glacier mass balances of the four study sites were spatially heterogeneous in 2000 2018 which may be mainly related to the spatial difference in snowfall variations rather than climate warming as shown in fig 7 the decrease of snowfall over the kunlun with the smallest glacier mass loss of 0 14 0 05 m w e yr 1 is much less than those over other three study sites moreover for the two neighbouring study sites of the geladandong and dongkemadi the snowfall decrease of the geladandong glacier mass loss of 0 26 0 07 m w e yr 1 is also less than that of the dongkemadi glacier mass loss of 0 44 0 10 m w e yr 1 however the increases of air temperature were similar with each other for the four study sites between 1979 and 2018 fig 6 furthermore since the transfer of snow and ice from the upper zones to the lower zones with glacier flow it is noteworthy that the least decrease of snowfall cannot be simply equivalent to that glacier accumulation over the upper regions of the kunlun is more than that of the three southern study sites under the similar climate warming of the four study sites the observed smallest ablation over the lower zones of the kunlun fig 4 is probably related to the fastest transfer of glacier material which could compensate the glacier mass losses induced by snow and ice melting on the lower regions 6 conclusions in this study the glacier mass balance of the sryr in 2000 2018 was investigated by using the srtm c dem and the glacier surface topographic data generated from zy3 tri stereo images according to the mountain glacier distribution we selected four study sites as the geladandong dongkemadi sedir and kunlun in the sryr by comparing the srtm c dem and the generated zy3 dems glacier mass balances range from 0 55 0 12 to 0 14 0 05 m w e yr 1 were estimated for the four study sites in 2000 2018 the smallest negative glacier mass change was observed over the northern study site kunlun whereas the three southern study sites experienced relatively moderate geladandong and serious dongkemadi and sedir glacier mass loss the observed heterogeneous glacier mass balances may be mainly attributed to the spatial difference in snowfall variations rather than air temperature increase overall for all glaciers in the sryr we derived the glacier mass budget of 0 343 0 055 gt yr 1 between 2000 and 2018 the river runoff of the sryr has been observed by the zhimenda hydrological station which was installed at the downstream of the tongtian river in july 1956 during the period 2000 2018 we calculated the annual runoff of 17 84 gt yr 1 therefore the contribution of glacier mass loss to the river runoff of the sryr was only 1 9 0 3 in the period 2000 2018 this indicates that glacier melting was not a major contributor to the water resource in the sryr during recent decades by taking into consideration of the total ice volume of the sryr 88 75 gt in shi et al 2005 if the glacier mass loss rate 0 343 0 055 gt yr 1 is not changed in the future glacier melting will continuously supply fresh water for the next two centuries however an accelerated glacier mass loss during recent years was detected over several glacierized regions in the sryr such as the geladandong mountain liu et al 2020 and xiaodongkemadi glacier zhang et al 2018 the investigations about recent temporal variations of mass balances over other glaciers in the sryr are needed to fully understand whether the accelerated glacier mass loss is a regional tendency credit authorship contribution statement lin liu methodology formal analysis visualization writing original

5273,the horton equation has been widely used to simulate infiltration under ponding conditions and many efforts have been made to expand the applicability of this method to non ponding conditions however because of the absence of appropriate drainage controls most existing modified horton methods cannot be used for continuous rainfall runoff simulations with long dry time periods the objective of this study is to develop a modified horton infiltration model mhi for both event and continuous simulations with soil moisture threshold controls unlike other modified horton methods nonlinear and linear equations are used in this new method to quantify the relationships between infiltration capacity and soil water storage respectively for wet and dry soil moisture conditions wet gravity driven free drainage stage dry capillarity dominated non drainage stage two tests of the mhi model were conducted to evaluate its performance in both event and continuous simulations fourteen modeling scenarios were considered in the event modeling test of mhi which involved three soil types of different initial water contents under various rainfall conditions the simulation results of mhi were compared with those simulated by a modified green ampt model and the reference data from mein and larson 1971 furthermore mhi was applied to a field site in grand forks north dakota for continuous modeling and compared against the observed data which demonstrated its capability in the modeling of infiltration and soil moisture variations keywords horton method infiltration soil water content event and continuous modeling 1 introduction infiltration is a critical hydrologic process that links surface and subsurface hydrologic systems mishra et al 2003 morbidelli et al 2018 however it is difficult to directly measure the variations of infiltration under natural conditions thus infiltration modeling has become an efficient and effective way to simulate its variations based on climate and soil properties singh 2016 a variety of infiltration models have been developed for different purposes e g green and ampt 1911 horton 1939 corradini et al 1997 however they have their own limitations and hence various modifications have been made to increase their applicability to complex conditions chu and marino 2005 corradini et al 2011 verma 1982 the horton method horton 1939 has been widely used for simulating infiltration under ponding conditions many efforts have been made to modify the original horton method to expand its applicability to various real conditions for example verma 1982 modified the horton method to deal with unsteady rainfall events by calculating infiltration capacity and ponding time based on cumulative infiltration however the modified method did not consider the recovery of soil water storage in dry periods and hence cannot be used for continuous simulations of infiltration similar to verma 1982 rossman 2010 also linked infiltration capacity and ponding time to real cumulative infiltration and utilized a recovery equation to update soil water storage during continuous simulations instead of using cumulative infiltration akan 1992 developed a linear function to represent the relationship between infiltration capacity and cumulative effective infiltration i e the infiltrating water in excess of equilibrium infiltration capacity however the cumulative effective infiltration decreases when rainfall intensity is less than the equilibrium infiltration capacity which is in contradiction to the definition of the cumulative effective infiltration akan 1992 to avoid this issue akan 1992 assumed that the rainfall with an intensity less than the equilibrium infiltration capacity did not influence the cumulative effective infiltration consequently the infiltration capacity simulated by using akan s method did not change under the aforementioned condition following akan 1992 mishra and singh 2002 derived a modified soil conservation service curve number scs cn method based on the horton equation and linked the cumulative effective infiltration akan 1992 with soil potential maximum retention in the scs cn method since both methods were derived from the horton equation using the same assumption the modified scs cn method mishra and singh 2002 had the same issue bauer 1974 proposed another modified horton method to calculate infiltration under intermittent rainfall events in which a drainage equation was developed and further combined with the horton equation to track the variations of soil water storage following bauer 1974 aron 1992 derived two linear functions to link the infiltration capacity and drainage rate respectively with the soil water storage since this modified method has no limitation on soil water drainage and evapotranspiration et it can be only used for intermittent rainfall events instead of multiple rainfall events with long dry periods based on aron s method diskin and nazimov 1995 developed a linear reservoir model to simulate infiltration but is was still subject to the limitations of aron s method gabellani et al 2008 proposed a combined horton scs method for flash flood modeling by assuming that the soil maximum retention in the scs cn method equaled the maximum soil storage in aron s method moreover to apply aron s method for continuous simulations of infiltration silvestro et al 2013 added a soil moisture threshold control based on field capacity however in that method the linear function that linked the infiltration capacity with the soil water storage in aron s method was directly used whatever the soil moisture condition was i e whether the soil water content was greater or less than the field capacity since the method was not derived from the original horton equation using the linear function under both moisture conditions can be questionable because of the aforementioned limitations of the current modified horton methods efforts are still needed to improve the applicability of the horton method for continuous simulations of infiltration the objective of this study is to develop a new modified horton infiltration mhi model that has the capabilities of both event and continuous simulations of infiltration in mhi two soil moisture thresholds i e field capacity and wilting point are used to respectively control soil water drainage and et the new model is tested for both event and continuous simulations in the event modeling test the performance of mhi is evaluated by comparing with a modified green ampt model chu and marino 2005 and a finite difference numerical model mein and larson 1971 for fourteen different modeling scenarios in addition mhi is used for continuous modeling for a field site in grand forks north dakota and the modeling results are compared against the observed data 2 materials and methods 2 1 existing modified horton methods the original horton equation horton 1939 is given by 1 f p t f c f 0 f c e k t where f p t is the potential infiltration capacity at time t l t f c is the final equilibrium infiltration capacity l t f 0 is the initial infiltration capacity l t and k is a decay parameter t 1 bauer 1974 introduced a drainage equation eq 2 and combined it with the horton equation eq 1 to calculate surface runoff and infiltration for intermittent rainfall events 2 d t f c f c e k t where d t is the drainage rate at time t l t furthermore aron 1992 eliminated time t in eqs 1 and 2 to create two linear functions that link the infiltration capacity and the drainage rate with the soil storage as shown in eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 f p t f 0 f 0 f c m t m max 4 d t f c m t m max where m t is the soil water storage at time t l and m max is the maximum soil water storage l fig 1 a and 1b show the variations of infiltration capacity and drainage rate with time and soil water storage under a ponding condition aron 1992 this method implies that the drainage rate is greater than zero whenever there is water in the soil therefore this method cannot be used for continuous simulations of infiltration for long dry time periods 2 2 new modified horton method 2 2 1 mathematical derivations compared with aron s method the modified horton method proposed in this study has the following unique features 1 soil water drainage occurs only when the soil water content is beyond the field capacity while et occurs only when the soil water content is greater than the wilting point 2 infiltration capacity has a non linear or linear relationship with the soil water storage when the soil water content is respectively less or greater than the field capacity under a ponding condition the variations of the infiltration capacity and the drainage rate with time and the soil water storage are shown in fig 1c and d respectively assuming the curves shown in fig 1d do not change with rainfall events a ponding condition corresponding to soil water storage of 0 is used to derive the new method based on eq 1 the infiltration capacity can be separated into dynamic infiltration and static infiltration mishra and singh 2002 5 f p t f d t f s t in which 6 f d t f 0 f c e k t 7 f s t f c where f d t is the dynamic infiltration at time t l t and f s t is the static infiltration at time t l t assuming that soil water drainage occurs when the soil water content is beyond the field capacity eq 2 can be modified as 8 d t f c f c e k t t 1 f o r t t 1 0 f o r t t 1 where t 1 is the time when the soil water content equals the field capacity t the cumulative infiltration and drainage can be obtained by integrating eqs 5 8 9 f p t f d t f s t 10 f d t f 0 f c k 1 e k t 11 f s t f c t 12 d t f c t t 1 f c k 1 e k t t 1 f o r t t 1 0 f o r t t 1 where f p t is the cumulative infiltration at time t l f d t is the cumulative dynamic infiltration at time t l f s t is the cumulative static infiltration at time t l and d t is the cumulative drainage at time t l substitution of eq 10 into eq 1 yields akan 1992 13 f p t f 0 k f d t eq 13 can be used to calculate infiltration capacity based on cumulative dynamic infiltration in akan s method cumulative dynamic infiltration i e cumulative effective infiltration equals soil water storage however in the current new method cumulative dynamic infiltration is a portion of soil water storage therefore it is required to obtain the relationship between cumulative dynamic infiltration and soil water storage combination of eqs 10 and 11 yields 14 f s t f c k l n 1 k f d t f 0 f c k f d t substitution of eq 14 into eq 9 yields 15 f p t f c k l n 1 k f d t f 0 f c k f d t f d t eq 15 implicitly links the cumulative dynamic infiltration to the cumulative infiltration therefore to link the cumulative dynamic infiltration to the soil water storage the relationship between the cumulative infiltration and the soil water storage needs to be found since the calculation methods of drainage rate are different when the soil water content is less and greater than the field capacity eq 12 two equations are derived to reveal the relationship between the cumulative infiltration and the soil water storage and further used to link the cumulative dynamic infiltration to the soil water storage if the soil water storage is less than that at the field capacity there is no soil water drainage and the mass balance equation under this condition can be expressed as 16 m t f p t substitution of eq 15 into eq 16 yields an implicit equation to calculate the cumulative dynamic infiltration based on soil water storage when it is less than the storage at at the field capacity 17 m t f c k l n 1 k f d t f 0 f c k f d t f d t f o r m t m fc where m fc is the soil water storage corresponding to the field capacity at time t 1 l if the soil water storage is greater than that at the field capacity drainage occurs and the mass balance equation under this condition is given by 18 m t f p t d t revision of eqs 9 and 10 yields 19 f p t f p t 1 f p t t 1 m fc f p f c f c k 1 e k t t 1 f c t t 1 20 f d t f d t 1 f d t t 1 f d f c f p f c f c k 1 e k t t 1 where f p f c is the infiltration capacity at the field capacity l t and f d f c is the cumulative dynamic infiltration at the field capacity l substitution of eqs 19 and 12 into 18 yields 21 m t m fc f p f c k 1 e k t t 1 substitution of eq 21 into eq 20 eliminates the exponential term in eq 21 furthermore eq 22 can be derived by replacing f p f c in eq 20 with eq 13 and can be used to calculate the cumulative dynamic infiltration based on the soil water storage when the soil water storage is greater than that at the field capacity 22 f d t f d f c 1 f c f 0 k f d f c m t m fc f o r m t m fc substitution of eq 21 into eq 8 yields an expression to calculate the drainage rate based on the soil water storage 23 d t k f c f 0 k f d f c m t m fc f o r m t m fc 0 f o r m t m fc given k f c f 0 m fc and f d f c f d t can be calculated for any m t by using eqs 17 and 22 after f d t is determined eqs 13 and 23 can be respectively used to calculate infiltration capacity and drainage rate for a continuous simulation the simulation period can be divided into many wet and dry periods in addition each wet period can be further divided into a set of ponding and non ponding conditions similar to aron 1992 to apply the new method for a continuous simulation it is assumed that the infiltration capacity and the drainage rate in dry periods and under non ponding conditions of wet periods also can be calculated by eqs 13 and 23 in addition the simulation of et is incorporated into the new method and wilting point is used to control the occurrence of et the effective soil depth mishra and singh 2004 is used in the new method and the et from this depth can be expressed as allen et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 mishra and singh 2004 24 t s m max ws 25 e t t k c et 0 t t s t s e x p 2 374 0 00713 t s f o r m t m wp 0 f o r m t m wp where t s is the depth of soil used in the new method l k c is the crop coefficient et 0 is the reference evapotranspiration l t and m wp is the soil water storage at wilting point l 2 2 2 modeling procedures of mhi the flowchart of mhi is shown in fig 2 the input data of mhi include soil property parameters e g wilting point and field capacity and meteorological data e g rainfall before the time loop four soil related parameters i e m fc f p f c f d f c and f 0 are calculated by using eqs 26 29 moreover based on these four parameters the initial values of three parameters are calculated by using a set of equations 1 the initial dynamic infiltration is calculated by using eqs 17 or 22 the initial infiltration capacity is calculated by using eq 13 and the initial drainage rate is calculated by using eq 23 26 m fc fc ws m max where fc is the field capacity l l and ws is the saturated soil water content l l according to eq 21 when t m t m fc f p f c k therefore f p f c can be calculated by 27 f p f c

f d f c in the time loop the actual infiltration and the soil water storage are respectively calculated by eqs 30 and 31 30 m f t f p t 1 δ t f o r i t f p t 1 i t δ t f o r i t f p t 1 31 m t m t 1 m f t where m f t is the volume of soil water storage that is increased by infiltration during time step t l i t is the rainfall intensity at time step t l t and δ t is the time interval t based on the drainage rate at the previous time step and the field capacity control the drainage is determined by using eq 32 and the soil water storage is updated accordingly by eq 33 32 m d t d t 1 δ t f o r m t

rate are updated based on the soil water storage until the simulations for all time steps are completed 2 3 introduction to the modified green ampt model chu and marino 2005 developed a modified green ampt mga model to simulate infiltration in heterogeneous soils with variable initial soil water distribution under unsteady rainfall events in mga an algorithm was proposed to track the movement of the wetting front through layered soils identify ponding and non ponding conditions and simulate the shift between ponding and non ponding conditions mga was further coupled with five different dry models in a windows based hydrologic modeling system hydrol inf for continuous simulation of hydrologic processes in a long time series that consists of both wet and dry periods chu and marino 2006 chu 2014 in this study both mhi and mga in hydrol inf were utilized and compared with the data simulations of a finite difference model from mein and larson 1971 including the cumulative infiltration and ponding time for fourteen modeling scenarios involving three soil types of different initial water contents under various rainfall conditions moreover the soil water contents simulated by mhi and mga were compared to analyze the distinction in their methodologies 2 4 input data 2 4 1 data for event modeling mein and larson 1971 solved the richards equation using the finite difference numerical method and published a series of infiltration data associated with different soil types in this study fourteen scenarios involving three soil types including plainfield sand ps columbia sandy loam csl and yolo light clay ylc different initial soil moisture contents and rainfall intensities table 1 were selected from mein and larson 1971 for the event simulations of infiltration by mhi and mga table 1 also lists the major soil parameters used for the event modeling the decay parameter and the equilibrium infiltration capacity of each soil in table 1 were the average values for the selected modeling scenarios mishra and singh 2004 the field capacity of each soil was estimated based on rawls et al 1982 in addition the saturated water content saturated hydraulic conductivity and capillary head of each soil were obtained from mein and larson 1971 2 4 2 data for continuous modeling soil moisture and rainfall data were collected at a field site located in the southwest of grand forks north dakota fig 3 a and the data were used for the continuous modeling a tipping bucket raingauge was used to record rainfall data and 8 soil moisture sensors were installed at different depth from 0 cm to 105 cm fig 3b to continuously measure soil moisture contents soil samples were collected at various depths fig 3b and soil particle analysis was peformed two soil types silty loam and silty clay loam were determined and their distributions along the profile are shown in fig 3b the observed hourly soil moisture and rainfall data were used for model calibration and validation in this study table 2 lists the soil properties for the field site note that the equilibrium infiltration capacity was assumed the same as the saturated hydraulic conductivity obtained from carsel and parrish 1988 the saturated water content was assumed the same as the maximum soil water content observed at the field site the field capacity and the wilting point of each soil type were estimated based on rawls et al 1982 to calculate et in the continuous simulation the reference et data were downloaded from the north dakota agricultural weather network ndawn website and the crop coefficient data were obtained from allen et al 1998 2 5 evaluation of model performance in the event modeling based on the parameters in table 1 simulations were performed by using mhi and mga for the fourteen modeling scenarios for mhi the maximum soil water storage values of ps csl and ylc were respectively determined by fitting the cumulative infiltration values simulated by mhi to the data from mein and larson 1971 for scenarios 3 12 and 14 the cumulative infiltration and ponding time simulated by mhi and mga were compared with the corresponding values from mein and larson 1971 furthermore the soil water contents of all soils simulated by both models within the effective soil depth were compared to reveal the fundamental differences in the methodologies between mhi and mga in the continuous modeling mhi was applied to simulate the variations of soil water contents at the field site in grand forks a period of 6 23 2018 0 00 7 21 2018 23 00 and a period of 7 22 2018 0 00 8 18 2018 23 00 were selected for model calibration and validation respectively the total rainfall depths were 9 32 cm and 3 73 cm for the calibration and validation periods respectively the performance of mhi was evaluated by comparing against the observed soil water content data in the calibration and validation periods in addition the major parameters for the calibration of mhi included the decay parameter and the maximum soil water storage in this study three statistical parameters including coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 and root mean square error rmse were used to quantitatively assess the performance of mhi and mga in both the event and continuous modeling tests the three statistical parameters can be respectively expressed as 36 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 37 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 38 rmse i 1 n o i s i 2 n where o i is the observed value at time step i s i is the simulated value at time step i o is the mean observed value s is the mean simulated value and n is the total number of time steps and n is the total number of time steps 3 results and discussion 3 1 event modeling 3 1 1 cumulative infiltration and ponding time the values of maximum water storage of ps csl and ylc are 4 52 cm 5 15 cm and 3 27 cm respectively fig 4 shows the detailed comparisons of the normalized cumulative infiltration values i e ratio of the simulated cumulative infiltration to the maximum cumulative infiltration from mein and larson 1971 as shown in fig 4a c compared with the data from mein and larson 1971 mhi underestimated the cumulative infiltration at the beginning of the simulations for most scenarios while the mga simulations were similar to the data for all soils fig 4d f the difference between mhi and mga can be attributed to the dissimilar methodologies associated with the horton and green ampt models unlike the green ampt model an initial infiltration capacity is specified in the horton method resultantly during the initial stage the infiltration capacity simulated by the green ampt model was greater and changed faster than that simulated by the horton model with the increase of the normalized cumulative infiltration the performances of both models were similar for each soil this is due to the smaller change in the infiltration capacity as the soil moisture approaches saturation table 3 shows that the simulations of infiltration under different rainfall and initial soil moisture conditions from both models are similar to the data from mein and larson 1971 for the 14 scenarios the average r2 nse and rmse are 1 00 0 99 and 0 10 respectively for the mhi simulations and are 1 0 1 0 and 0 06 respectively for the mga simulations table 3 fig 5 shows the comparisons of the ponding times simulated by mhi and mga with the data from mein and larson 1971 for all modeling scenarios overall compared with mhi the ponding time of each soil simulated by mga was closer to the data from mein and larson 1971 when the ponding time was relatively short fig 5 and table 4 similar to the simulated cumulative infiltration the underestimation of ponding time for mhi can also be attributed to the difference between the horton and green ampt methods 3 1 2 soil water content the soil water contents simulated by mhi and mga were also compared to reveal the differences resulted from their dissimilar methodologies based on the maximum soil water storage values of all soils and eq 24 the effective soil depths in the mhi modeling for ps csl and ylc were 9 42 cm 9 91 cm and 6 54 cm respectively the selection of such effective depths was consistent with mishra and singh 2004 the performance of mhi in the simulation of soil water content was similar within each group table 5 however due to the slow variation in the infiltration capacity of the finer soils the performances of mhi and mga were closer for the finer soils table 5 for example the average r2 nse and rmse for ylc finer soil were 0 96 0 92 0 01 respectively while the average r2 nse and rmse of ps coarser soil were 0 89 0 70 0 03 respectively fig 6 shows the comparison of the soil water contents simulated by mhi and mga for three scenarios it can be observed that the main difference occurred at the beginning of the simulation fig 6 the soil water content simulated by mga had a sudden increase and then reached the saturated water content while the soil water content simulated by mhi increased by following a logarithmic shape similar to the simulation results of the cumulative infiltration and the ponding time the difference in the simulated soil water contents can also be attributed to the difference in the horton green ampt methods in addition the difference in the soil water contents simulated by mhi and mga was smaller for finer soils e g ylc which was due to the smaller variations in the infiltration capacities 3 2 analysis of continuous modeling results in the continuous modeling the calibrated maximum soil water storage and decay parameter were 6 39 cm and 0 4 hr 1 respectively based on eq 24 the effictive soil depth in mhi was 12 41 cm thus only the parameters related to the first soil layer in fig 3b were used in mhi in addition the average observed water content data of the top 10 cm soil were compared with those simulated by mhi mhi successfully simulated the variations of the soil water contents for both calibration and validation periods fig 7 a and b however it overestimated the soil water contents after each rainfall event during the calibration period fig 7a compared with the calibration period the validation period was relatively dry fig 7b during this period mhi successfully simulated the variation of the soil water content after each rainfall event but underestimated the soil water content at the end of this period the r2 nse and rmse values were 0 88 and 0 83 0 73 and 0 77 and 0 02 and 0 01 for the calibration and validation periods respectively according to the values of nse the performances of mhi in both periods were good moriasi et al 2007 in addition the values of r2 and rmse also indicate a linear relationship with small errors between the observed and simulated soil water contents in both periods fig 7a and b fig 7c shows the temporal variations of several hydrologic variables during the calibration period comparing the cumulative rainfall with the cumulative infiltration indicated that most rainwater infiltrated into the soil during the calibration period the threshold control of field capacity occurred four times e g 6 27 2018 12 00 and et dominated the variations of soil water content after the occurrence of the threshold control additionally due to the threshold control percolation occurred only from 54 hrs to 135 hrs instead of the entire calibration period similar to the calibration period the field capacity control was also observed during the validation period fig 7d and percolation occurred only in a short period after the rainfall events because of the threshold control therefore it can be concluded that the underestimation of soil water content in the end of the validation period fig 7b was caused by the overestimation of et in addition since the wilting point was small 0 13 and the soil water content did not reach the wilting point during the calibration and validation periods the threshold control of wilting point was not observed in both periods 4 summary and conclusion the application of the original horton method is limited to ponding conditions and most modified horton methods can only be used for modeling for individual or intermittent rainfall events a new modified horton method was proposed in this study for event and continuous modeling of infiltration and other related hydrologic processes the new model mhi was then applied and its performance was evaluated the unique features of mhi include 1 it implements soil moisture threshold control based on field capacity and wilting point and 2 non linear and linear relationships between infiltration capacity and soil water storage are respectively used for capillary tension dominated flow soil water content field capacity and gravity dominated flow soil water content field capacity overall mhi successfully simulated the infiltration processes in both event and continuous modeling it was found from the event modeling that the performance of mhi was similar to that of mga model except for the simulation at the beginning for coarser soils e g ps the difference can be attributed to the discrepancy between the horton and green ampt methods for finer soils e g ylc because of the small variation in infiltration capacity the two models had similar performance the threshold controls were critical to the application of mhi in continuous simulations the field capacity threshold control effectively reduced both amount and duration of deep soil water percolation which resulted in good agreement between the simulated and observed soil water contents although mhi had good performances in the event and continuous simulations it still has some limitations for example as a calibration parameter maximum soil water storage is difficult to be determined in addition there are no widely accepted criteria to determine the range of the decay parameter in the original horton equation for different soils therefore linking maximum soil water storage and decay parameter to certain commonly used soil hydraulic parameters can potentially improve the related modeling credit authorship contribution statement ning wang conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation writing original draft writing review

5273,the horton equation has been widely used to simulate infiltration under ponding conditions and many efforts have been made to expand the applicability of this method to non ponding conditions however because of the absence of appropriate drainage controls most existing modified horton methods cannot be used for continuous rainfall runoff simulations with long dry time periods the objective of this study is to develop a modified horton infiltration model mhi for both event and continuous simulations with soil moisture threshold controls unlike other modified horton methods nonlinear and linear equations are used in this new method to quantify the relationships between infiltration capacity and soil water storage respectively for wet and dry soil moisture conditions wet gravity driven free drainage stage dry capillarity dominated non drainage stage two tests of the mhi model were conducted to evaluate its performance in both event and continuous simulations fourteen modeling scenarios were considered in the event modeling test of mhi which involved three soil types of different initial water contents under various rainfall conditions the simulation results of mhi were compared with those simulated by a modified green ampt model and the reference data from mein and larson 1971 furthermore mhi was applied to a field site in grand forks north dakota for continuous modeling and compared against the observed data which demonstrated its capability in the modeling of infiltration and soil moisture variations keywords horton method infiltration soil water content event and continuous modeling 1 introduction infiltration is a critical hydrologic process that links surface and subsurface hydrologic systems mishra et al 2003 morbidelli et al 2018 however it is difficult to directly measure the variations of infiltration under natural conditions thus infiltration modeling has become an efficient and effective way to simulate its variations based on climate and soil properties singh 2016 a variety of infiltration models have been developed for different purposes e g green and ampt 1911 horton 1939 corradini et al 1997 however they have their own limitations and hence various modifications have been made to increase their applicability to complex conditions chu and marino 2005 corradini et al 2011 verma 1982 the horton method horton 1939 has been widely used for simulating infiltration under ponding conditions many efforts have been made to modify the original horton method to expand its applicability to various real conditions for example verma 1982 modified the horton method to deal with unsteady rainfall events by calculating infiltration capacity and ponding time based on cumulative infiltration however the modified method did not consider the recovery of soil water storage in dry periods and hence cannot be used for continuous simulations of infiltration similar to verma 1982 rossman 2010 also linked infiltration capacity and ponding time to real cumulative infiltration and utilized a recovery equation to update soil water storage during continuous simulations instead of using cumulative infiltration akan 1992 developed a linear function to represent the relationship between infiltration capacity and cumulative effective infiltration i e the infiltrating water in excess of equilibrium infiltration capacity however the cumulative effective infiltration decreases when rainfall intensity is less than the equilibrium infiltration capacity which is in contradiction to the definition of the cumulative effective infiltration akan 1992 to avoid this issue akan 1992 assumed that the rainfall with an intensity less than the equilibrium infiltration capacity did not influence the cumulative effective infiltration consequently the infiltration capacity simulated by using akan s method did not change under the aforementioned condition following akan 1992 mishra and singh 2002 derived a modified soil conservation service curve number scs cn method based on the horton equation and linked the cumulative effective infiltration akan 1992 with soil potential maximum retention in the scs cn method since both methods were derived from the horton equation using the same assumption the modified scs cn method mishra and singh 2002 had the same issue bauer 1974 proposed another modified horton method to calculate infiltration under intermittent rainfall events in which a drainage equation was developed and further combined with the horton equation to track the variations of soil water storage following bauer 1974 aron 1992 derived two linear functions to link the infiltration capacity and drainage rate respectively with the soil water storage since this modified method has no limitation on soil water drainage and evapotranspiration et it can be only used for intermittent rainfall events instead of multiple rainfall events with long dry periods based on aron s method diskin and nazimov 1995 developed a linear reservoir model to simulate infiltration but is was still subject to the limitations of aron s method gabellani et al 2008 proposed a combined horton scs method for flash flood modeling by assuming that the soil maximum retention in the scs cn method equaled the maximum soil storage in aron s method moreover to apply aron s method for continuous simulations of infiltration silvestro et al 2013 added a soil moisture threshold control based on field capacity however in that method the linear function that linked the infiltration capacity with the soil water storage in aron s method was directly used whatever the soil moisture condition was i e whether the soil water content was greater or less than the field capacity since the method was not derived from the original horton equation using the linear function under both moisture conditions can be questionable because of the aforementioned limitations of the current modified horton methods efforts are still needed to improve the applicability of the horton method for continuous simulations of infiltration the objective of this study is to develop a new modified horton infiltration mhi model that has the capabilities of both event and continuous simulations of infiltration in mhi two soil moisture thresholds i e field capacity and wilting point are used to respectively control soil water drainage and et the new model is tested for both event and continuous simulations in the event modeling test the performance of mhi is evaluated by comparing with a modified green ampt model chu and marino 2005 and a finite difference numerical model mein and larson 1971 for fourteen different modeling scenarios in addition mhi is used for continuous modeling for a field site in grand forks north dakota and the modeling results are compared against the observed data 2 materials and methods 2 1 existing modified horton methods the original horton equation horton 1939 is given by 1 f p t f c f 0 f c e k t where f p t is the potential infiltration capacity at time t l t f c is the final equilibrium infiltration capacity l t f 0 is the initial infiltration capacity l t and k is a decay parameter t 1 bauer 1974 introduced a drainage equation eq 2 and combined it with the horton equation eq 1 to calculate surface runoff and infiltration for intermittent rainfall events 2 d t f c f c e k t where d t is the drainage rate at time t l t furthermore aron 1992 eliminated time t in eqs 1 and 2 to create two linear functions that link the infiltration capacity and the drainage rate with the soil storage as shown in eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 f p t f 0 f 0 f c m t m max 4 d t f c m t m max where m t is the soil water storage at time t l and m max is the maximum soil water storage l fig 1 a and 1b show the variations of infiltration capacity and drainage rate with time and soil water storage under a ponding condition aron 1992 this method implies that the drainage rate is greater than zero whenever there is water in the soil therefore this method cannot be used for continuous simulations of infiltration for long dry time periods 2 2 new modified horton method 2 2 1 mathematical derivations compared with aron s method the modified horton method proposed in this study has the following unique features 1 soil water drainage occurs only when the soil water content is beyond the field capacity while et occurs only when the soil water content is greater than the wilting point 2 infiltration capacity has a non linear or linear relationship with the soil water storage when the soil water content is respectively less or greater than the field capacity under a ponding condition the variations of the infiltration capacity and the drainage rate with time and the soil water storage are shown in fig 1c and d respectively assuming the curves shown in fig 1d do not change with rainfall events a ponding condition corresponding to soil water storage of 0 is used to derive the new method based on eq 1 the infiltration capacity can be separated into dynamic infiltration and static infiltration mishra and singh 2002 5 f p t f d t f s t in which 6 f d t f 0 f c e k t 7 f s t f c where f d t is the dynamic infiltration at time t l t and f s t is the static infiltration at time t l t assuming that soil water drainage occurs when the soil water content is beyond the field capacity eq 2 can be modified as 8 d t f c f c e k t t 1 f o r t t 1 0 f o r t t 1 where t 1 is the time when the soil water content equals the field capacity t the cumulative infiltration and drainage can be obtained by integrating eqs 5 8 9 f p t f d t f s t 10 f d t f 0 f c k 1 e k t 11 f s t f c t 12 d t f c t t 1 f c k 1 e k t t 1 f o r t t 1 0 f o r t t 1 where f p t is the cumulative infiltration at time t l f d t is the cumulative dynamic infiltration at time t l f s t is the cumulative static infiltration at time t l and d t is the cumulative drainage at time t l substitution of eq 10 into eq 1 yields akan 1992 13 f p t f 0 k f d t eq 13 can be used to calculate infiltration capacity based on cumulative dynamic infiltration in akan s method cumulative dynamic infiltration i e cumulative effective infiltration equals soil water storage however in the current new method cumulative dynamic infiltration is a portion of soil water storage therefore it is required to obtain the relationship between cumulative dynamic infiltration and soil water storage combination of eqs 10 and 11 yields 14 f s t f c k l n 1 k f d t f 0 f c k f d t substitution of eq 14 into eq 9 yields 15 f p t f c k l n 1 k f d t f 0 f c k f d t f d t eq 15 implicitly links the cumulative dynamic infiltration to the cumulative infiltration therefore to link the cumulative dynamic infiltration to the soil water storage the relationship between the cumulative infiltration and the soil water storage needs to be found since the calculation methods of drainage rate are different when the soil water content is less and greater than the field capacity eq 12 two equations are derived to reveal the relationship between the cumulative infiltration and the soil water storage and further used to link the cumulative dynamic infiltration to the soil water storage if the soil water storage is less than that at the field capacity there is no soil water drainage and the mass balance equation under this condition can be expressed as 16 m t f p t substitution of eq 15 into eq 16 yields an implicit equation to calculate the cumulative dynamic infiltration based on soil water storage when it is less than the storage at at the field capacity 17 m t f c k l n 1 k f d t f 0 f c k f d t f d t f o r m t m fc where m fc is the soil water storage corresponding to the field capacity at time t 1 l if the soil water storage is greater than that at the field capacity drainage occurs and the mass balance equation under this condition is given by 18 m t f p t d t revision of eqs 9 and 10 yields 19 f p t f p t 1 f p t t 1 m fc f p f c f c k 1 e k t t 1 f c t t 1 20 f d t f d t 1 f d t t 1 f d f c f p f c f c k 1 e k t t 1 where f p f c is the infiltration capacity at the field capacity l t and f d f c is the cumulative dynamic infiltration at the field capacity l substitution of eqs 19 and 12 into 18 yields 21 m t m fc f p f c k 1 e k t t 1 substitution of eq 21 into eq 20 eliminates the exponential term in eq 21 furthermore eq 22 can be derived by replacing f p f c in eq 20 with eq 13 and can be used to calculate the cumulative dynamic infiltration based on the soil water storage when the soil water storage is greater than that at the field capacity 22 f d t f d f c 1 f c f 0 k f d f c m t m fc f o r m t m fc substitution of eq 21 into eq 8 yields an expression to calculate the drainage rate based on the soil water storage 23 d t k f c f 0 k f d f c m t m fc f o r m t m fc 0 f o r m t m fc given k f c f 0 m fc and f d f c f d t can be calculated for any m t by using eqs 17 and 22 after f d t is determined eqs 13 and 23 can be respectively used to calculate infiltration capacity and drainage rate for a continuous simulation the simulation period can be divided into many wet and dry periods in addition each wet period can be further divided into a set of ponding and non ponding conditions similar to aron 1992 to apply the new method for a continuous simulation it is assumed that the infiltration capacity and the drainage rate in dry periods and under non ponding conditions of wet periods also can be calculated by eqs 13 and 23 in addition the simulation of et is incorporated into the new method and wilting point is used to control the occurrence of et the effective soil depth mishra and singh 2004 is used in the new method and the et from this depth can be expressed as allen et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 mishra and singh 2004 24 t s m max ws 25 e t t k c et 0 t t s t s e x p 2 374 0 00713 t s f o r m t m wp 0 f o r m t m wp where t s is the depth of soil used in the new method l k c is the crop coefficient et 0 is the reference evapotranspiration l t and m wp is the soil water storage at wilting point l 2 2 2 modeling procedures of mhi the flowchart of mhi is shown in fig 2 the input data of mhi include soil property parameters e g wilting point and field capacity and meteorological data e g rainfall before the time loop four soil related parameters i e m fc f p f c f d f c and f 0 are calculated by using eqs 26 29 moreover based on these four parameters the initial values of three parameters are calculated by using a set of equations 1 the initial dynamic infiltration is calculated by using eqs 17 or 22 the initial infiltration capacity is calculated by using eq 13 and the initial drainage rate is calculated by using eq 23 26 m fc fc ws m max where fc is the field capacity l l and ws is the saturated soil water content l l according to eq 21 when t m t m fc f p f c k therefore f p f c can be calculated by 27 f p f c

f d f c in the time loop the actual infiltration and the soil water storage are respectively calculated by eqs 30 and 31 30 m f t f p t 1 δ t f o r i t f p t 1 i t δ t f o r i t f p t 1 31 m t m t 1 m

drainage rate at the previous time step and the field capacity control the drainage is determined by using eq 32 and the soil water storage is updated accordingly by eq 33 32 m d t d t 1 δ t f o r m t

rate are updated based on the soil water storage until the simulations for all time steps are completed 2 3 introduction to the modified green ampt model chu and marino 2005 developed a modified green ampt mga model to simulate infiltration in heterogeneous soils with variable initial soil water distribution under unsteady rainfall events in mga an algorithm was proposed to track the movement of the wetting front through layered soils identify ponding and non ponding conditions and simulate the shift between ponding and non ponding conditions mga was further coupled with five different dry models in a windows based hydrologic modeling system hydrol inf for continuous simulation of hydrologic processes in a long time series that consists of both wet and dry periods chu and marino 2006 chu 2014 in this study both mhi and mga in hydrol inf were utilized and compared with the data simulations of a finite difference model from mein and larson 1971 including the cumulative infiltration and ponding time for fourteen modeling scenarios involving three soil types of different initial water contents under various rainfall conditions moreover the soil water contents simulated by mhi and mga were compared to analyze the distinction in their methodologies 2 4 input data 2 4 1 data for event modeling mein and larson 1971 solved the richards equation using the finite difference numerical method and published a series of infiltration data associated with different soil types in this study fourteen scenarios involving three soil types including plainfield sand ps columbia sandy loam csl and yolo light clay ylc different initial soil moisture contents and rainfall intensities table 1 were selected from mein and larson 1971 for the event simulations of infiltration by mhi and mga table 1 also lists the major soil parameters used for the event modeling the decay parameter and the equilibrium infiltration capacity of each soil in table 1 were the average values for the selected modeling scenarios mishra and singh 2004 the field capacity of each soil was estimated based on rawls et al 1982 in addition the saturated water content saturated hydraulic conductivity and capillary head of each soil were obtained from mein and larson 1971 2 4 2 data for continuous modeling soil moisture and rainfall data were collected at a field site located in the southwest of grand forks north dakota fig 3 a and the data were used for the continuous modeling a tipping bucket raingauge was used to record rainfall data and 8 soil moisture sensors were installed at different depth from 0 cm to 105 cm fig 3b to continuously measure soil moisture contents soil samples were collected at various depths fig 3b and soil particle analysis was peformed two soil types silty loam and silty clay loam were determined and their distributions along the profile are shown in fig 3b the observed hourly soil moisture and rainfall data were used for model calibration and validation in this study table 2 lists the soil properties for the field site note that the equilibrium infiltration capacity was assumed the same as the saturated hydraulic conductivity obtained from carsel and parrish 1988 the saturated water content was assumed the same as the maximum soil water content observed at the field site the field capacity and the wilting point of each soil type were estimated based on rawls et al 1982 to calculate et in the continuous simulation the reference et data were downloaded from the north dakota agricultural weather network ndawn website and the crop coefficient data were obtained from allen et al 1998 2 5 evaluation of model performance in the event modeling based on the parameters in table 1 simulations were performed by using mhi and mga for the fourteen modeling scenarios for mhi the maximum soil water storage values of ps csl and ylc were respectively determined by fitting the cumulative infiltration values simulated by mhi to the data from mein and larson 1971 for scenarios 3 12 and 14 the cumulative infiltration and ponding time simulated by mhi and mga were compared with the corresponding values from mein and larson 1971 furthermore the soil water contents of all soils simulated by both models within the effective soil depth were compared to reveal the fundamental differences in the methodologies between mhi and mga in the continuous modeling mhi was applied to simulate the variations of soil water contents at the field site in grand forks a period of 6 23 2018 0 00 7 21 2018 23 00 and a period of 7 22 2018 0 00 8 18 2018 23 00 were selected for model calibration and validation respectively the total rainfall depths were 9 32 cm and 3 73 cm for the calibration and validation periods respectively the performance of mhi was evaluated by comparing against the observed soil water content data in the calibration and validation periods in addition the major parameters for the calibration of mhi included the decay parameter and the maximum soil water storage in this study three statistical parameters including coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 and root mean square error rmse were used to quantitatively assess the performance of mhi and mga in both the event and continuous modeling tests the three statistical parameters can be respectively expressed as 36 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 37 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 38 rmse i 1 n o i s i 2 n where o i is the observed value at time step i s i is the simulated value at time step i o is the mean observed value s is the mean simulated value and n is the total number of time steps and n is the total number of time steps 3 results and discussion 3 1 event modeling 3 1 1 cumulative infiltration and ponding time the values of maximum water storage of ps csl and ylc are 4 52 cm 5 15 cm and 3 27 cm respectively fig 4 shows the detailed comparisons of the normalized cumulative infiltration values i e ratio of the simulated cumulative infiltration to the maximum cumulative infiltration from mein and larson 1971 as shown in fig 4a c compared with the data from mein and larson 1971 mhi underestimated the cumulative infiltration at the beginning of the simulations for most scenarios while the mga simulations were similar to the data for all soils fig 4d f the difference between mhi and mga can be attributed to the dissimilar methodologies associated with the horton and green ampt models unlike the green ampt model an initial infiltration capacity is specified in the horton method resultantly during the initial stage the infiltration capacity simulated by the green ampt model was greater and changed faster than that simulated by the horton model with the increase of the normalized cumulative infiltration the performances of both models were similar for each soil this is due to the smaller change in the infiltration capacity as the soil moisture approaches saturation table 3 shows that the simulations of infiltration under different rainfall and initial soil moisture conditions from both models are similar to the data from mein and larson 1971 for the 14 scenarios the average r2 nse and rmse are 1 00 0 99 and 0 10 respectively for the mhi simulations and are 1 0 1 0 and 0 06 respectively for the mga simulations table 3 fig 5 shows the comparisons of the ponding times simulated by mhi and mga with the data from mein and larson 1971 for all modeling scenarios overall compared with mhi the ponding time of each soil simulated by mga was closer to the data from mein and larson 1971 when the ponding time was relatively short fig 5 and table 4 similar to the simulated cumulative infiltration the underestimation of ponding time for mhi can also be attributed to the difference between the horton and green ampt methods 3 1 2 soil water content the soil water contents simulated by mhi and mga were also compared to reveal the differences resulted from their dissimilar methodologies based on the maximum soil water storage values of all soils and eq 24 the effective soil depths in the mhi modeling for ps csl and ylc were 9 42 cm 9 91 cm and 6 54 cm respectively the selection of such effective depths was consistent with mishra and singh 2004 the performance of mhi in the simulation of soil water content was similar within each group table 5 however due to the slow variation in the infiltration capacity of the finer soils the performances of mhi and mga were closer for the finer soils table 5 for example the average r2 nse and rmse for ylc finer soil were 0 96 0 92 0 01 respectively while the average r2 nse and rmse of ps coarser soil were 0 89 0 70 0 03 respectively fig 6 shows the comparison of the soil water contents simulated by mhi and mga for three scenarios it can be observed that the main difference occurred at the beginning of the simulation fig 6 the soil water content simulated by mga had a sudden increase and then reached the saturated water content while the soil water content simulated by mhi increased by following a logarithmic shape similar to the simulation results of the cumulative infiltration and the ponding time the difference in the simulated soil water contents can also be attributed to the difference in the horton green ampt methods in addition the difference in the soil water contents simulated by mhi and mga was smaller for finer soils e g ylc which was due to the smaller variations in the infiltration capacities 3 2 analysis of continuous modeling results in the continuous modeling the calibrated maximum soil water storage and decay parameter were 6 39 cm and 0 4 hr 1 respectively based on eq 24 the effictive soil depth in mhi was 12 41 cm thus only the parameters related to the first soil layer in fig 3b were used in mhi in addition the average observed water content data of the top 10 cm soil were compared with those simulated by mhi mhi successfully simulated the variations of the soil water contents for both calibration and validation periods fig 7 a and b however it overestimated the soil water contents after each rainfall event during the calibration period fig 7a compared with the calibration period the validation period was relatively dry fig 7b during this period mhi successfully simulated the variation of the soil water content after each rainfall event but underestimated the soil water content at the end of this period the r2 nse and rmse values were 0 88 and 0 83 0 73 and 0 77 and 0 02 and 0 01 for the calibration and validation periods respectively according to the values of nse the performances of mhi in both periods were good moriasi et al 2007 in addition the values of r2 and rmse also indicate a linear relationship with small errors between the observed and simulated soil water contents in both periods fig 7a and b fig 7c shows the temporal variations of several hydrologic variables during the calibration period comparing the cumulative rainfall with the cumulative infiltration indicated that most rainwater infiltrated into the soil during the calibration period the threshold control of field capacity occurred four times e g 6 27 2018 12 00 and et dominated the variations of soil water content after the occurrence of the threshold control additionally due to the threshold control percolation occurred only from 54 hrs to 135 hrs instead of the entire calibration period similar to the calibration period the field capacity control was also observed during the validation period fig 7d and percolation occurred only in a short period after the rainfall events because of the threshold control therefore it can be concluded that the underestimation of soil water content in the end of the validation period fig 7b was caused by the overestimation of et in addition since the wilting point was small 0 13 and the soil water content did not reach the wilting point during the calibration and validation periods the threshold control of wilting point was not observed in both periods 4 summary and conclusion the application of the original horton method is limited to ponding conditions and most modified horton methods can only be used for modeling for individual or intermittent rainfall events a new modified horton method was proposed in this study for event and continuous modeling of infiltration and other related hydrologic processes the new model mhi was then applied and its performance was evaluated the unique features of mhi include 1 it implements soil moisture threshold control based on field capacity and wilting point and 2 non linear and linear relationships between infiltration capacity and soil water storage are respectively used for capillary tension dominated flow soil water content field capacity and gravity dominated flow soil water content field capacity overall mhi successfully simulated the infiltration processes in both event and continuous modeling it was found from the event modeling that the performance of mhi was similar to that of mga model except for the simulation at the beginning for coarser soils e g ps the difference can be attributed to the discrepancy between the horton and green ampt methods for finer soils e g ylc because of the small variation in infiltration capacity the two models had similar performance the threshold controls were critical to the application of mhi in continuous simulations the field capacity threshold control effectively reduced both amount and duration of deep soil water percolation which resulted in good agreement between the simulated and observed soil water contents although mhi had good performances in the event and continuous simulations it still has some limitations for example as a calibration parameter maximum soil water storage is difficult to be determined in addition there are no widely accepted criteria to determine the range of the decay

5274,the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic 2h and 18o tracer method has become an important means of studying water transfer between the atmosphere rivers and lakes soils plants and aquifers we conducted a study on the variations of the stable isotopes of water and the seasonal variations in water use of cinnamomum camphora in the soil plant atmosphere continuum in a c camphora woodland in changsha central southern china which lies within the monsoon region of east asia stable isotopes were monitored in precipitation soil water 0 130 cm depth groundwater twig xylem water of c camphora and at the same time relevant environmental variables soil water content and meteorological variables were measured from march 2017 to august 2019 the monitoring data were collated and analyzed to determine the variations of stable isotopes in different water pools and mutual exchanges the results indicate that daily precipitation p greater than 3 7 mm regarded as effective precipitation contributed to soil water replenishment isotopic composition of soil water and twig xylem water fell below the lmwlp 3 7 the local meteoric water line eliminated rainfall events with p 3 7 mm isotopic composition of shallow soil water 0 60 cm and twig xylem water was positively correlated with that of cumulative antecedent precipitation within two months these patterns of precipitation isotopic signal propagation delineate a clear pathway of water transfer in this soil and plant continuum the slope of the soil water line in the study area was higher than that of the lmwlp 3 7 because of the situation that precipitation in warm season with a larger evaporative demand is more depleted with heavy isotopes i e more negative delta values than that in cold season when the evaporative demand is low therefore it was not feasible to determine the strength of isotopic fractionation based on the isotopic water line method according to the mixsir model c camphora water uptake mainly sourced from shallow soil water during the observation period however in july september when soil was dry deep soil water 60 130 cm contributed to c camphora water uptake for 50 these findings improve our understanding of the water cycle of the soil plant atmosphere continuum in the east asian monsoon region keywords east asian monsoon region stable isotopes precipitation soil water xylem water plant water sources 1 introduction the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac transfers water between the pedosphere atmosphere and biosphere thus the spac water transfer is an important issue in soil science ecology and hydrology in spac soil moisture storage replenished by infiltration from precipitation supplies water for plants and recharges groundwater chen et al 2017 gazis and feng 2004 song et al 2009 sprenger et al 2017 redistribution and mixing of soil moisture occur after precipitation infiltrates into a soil plants absorb soil water through the root system and then transport it through xylem to leaves for transpiration providing a means of returning water to the atmosphere evaporation of shallow soil moisture also returns water back to the atmosphere root water uptake and transpiration is the main water consumption in a forest ecosystem and therefore it is important to understand the processes of water transfer within the spac stable isotope analysis is able to reveal water movement and mixing between different water pools thus it has become an important means of studying water transfer in the spac dawson et al 2002 ma et al 2019 orlowski et al 2016a many studies have been conducted on the temporal variations of water stable isotopes of various pools the depth profiles of stable isotopes in soil water the relationship between the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic ratios δ2h and δ18o of different water pools and plant water use sources the stable isotopic composition of soil water can largely retain the precipitation isotopic signal and exhibits pronounced seasonal variations for example robertson and gazis 2006 found that the seasonal variation of stable isotopes of oxygen in soil water and precipitation in washington state usa was dependent on the regional climatic characteristics given the vertical variations of stable isotopes in soil water many researchers have found evidence of preferential flow in soil gazis and feng 2004 orlowski et al 2016a song et al 2011 yang and fu 2017 due to isotopic evaporative fractionation soil water that has undergone evaporation is more enriched in heavy isotopes than the water source as a result the slope of the linear relationship between δ2h and δ18o in the local meteoric water line lmwl craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 is generally higher than that of the soil water line swl gibson et al 2008 hervé fernández et al 2016 wang et al 2019 wenninger et al 2010 previous studies have shown that except for a few xerophytes or halophytes the stable isotopic composition especially 18o of stem xylem water does not undergo fractionation during the process of water uptake through the root system and transportation in plants therefore the stable isotopic composition in stem xylem water represents the integration of root uptake water sources brunel et al 1995 ellsworth and williams 2007 sprenger et al 2016 consequently the methodology based on mass conservation of stable isotopes enables both a qualitative analysis of the depths of plant water uptake and a quantitative estimation of the water use proportion from each water source nie et al 2012 phillips and gregg 2003 rong et al 2011 previous investigations of water stable isotopes in the spac were mainly in arid and semi arid regions brunel et al 1995 eggemeyer et al 2008 gierke et al 2016 yang and fu 2017 there have been few studies in humid and sub humid areas luo et al 2019 nie et al 2019 moreover many of these studies were generally based on data collected over a short period sprenger et al 2017 making them difficult to obtain a detailed view of stable isotopic composition and their relationships between precipitation soil water and stem xylem water several studies have shown that the intersection of the swl and the lmwl can be interpreted as the isotopic composition of the precipitation source water hervé fernández et al 2016 evaristo et al 2015 benettin et al 2018 found that when the isotopic variation in precipitation or the seasonality of evaporation fractionation of the evaporated samples were large the intersection of the swl and the lmwl deviated greatly from the true water source gibson et al 2008 simulated the swl slope of the upper soil water in south america africa australia and europe based on the craig gordon model which has a small range from 2 to 3 however the swls observed in different regions vary in a large range hervé fernández et al 2016 wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2013 comparison of the slopes between swl and lmwl has been applied to examine if soil water has undergone evaporation wan liu 2016 wang et al 2019 however other studies found that the slope of the swl was higher than that of the lmwl wu et al 2018 yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 which invalidate the approach of using swl to investigate soil evaporation therefore the isotopic water line approach for spac needs to be examined in this study we monitored stable isotopic composition in precipitation soil water 0 130 cm groundwater twig xylem water and relevant environmental variables soil water content soil temperature and meteorological variables in a cinnamomum camphora woodland in changsha a monsoonal region of east asia the study period was from march 2017 to august 2019 the monitoring data were collated and analyzed to determine the variations of stable isotopes in different water pools their influencing factors and their mutual relationships the objectives of the study were 1 to investigate precipitation isotopic signal propagation in a spac 2 to examine if the isotopic water line approach applies in the spac and 3 to determine the sources for plant water uptake 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the experiment was carried out in a woodland located in a suburb of changsha city hunan province in central southern china 28 22 8 02 n 112 45 42 91 e fig 1 the climate of the study area is monsoonal dominated by southwesterly and southeasterly winds during the summer monsoon april september and by northerly winds during the winter monsoon october march mean annual air temperature mean annual precipitation and mean annual evaporation are 17 4 c 1447 mm and 902 mm respectively the study plot is on a low angle 2 3 hillslope on relatively flat terrain with an elevation of 50 m above sea level the soil at the site is red earth with ph values from 6 0 to 7 0 within the depth interval of 0 130 cm of the soil profile the soil texture is silty clay loam with silt comprising more than 700 g kg 1 the soil bulk density ranges from 1 16 to 1 40 g cm 3 and increases with depth and the soil porosity ranges from 47 2 to 56 2 and decreases with depth evergreen broadleaf trees c camphora are dominant 90 in the plot and their average age and height are 13 yr and 9 m the lateral roots of c camphora are well developed other species include pinus massoniana cunninghamia lanceolata and sparse herbaceous plants the litter layer is 1 cm thick 2 2 sampling and measurements soil and twig xylem of c camphora were sampled at the target site an area of 20 40 m2 from march 2017 to august 2019 with a sampling frequency of 2 3 times per month three replicate soil samples were taken from three different cores at 10 cm intervals to the depth of 130 cm using a soil corer driven by a power operated hammer christie engineering pty ltd australia fresh soil samples were placed in 10 ml glass bottles for twig xylem sampling lignified branches 1 5 cm in diameter and 4 6 cm in length were cut from 3 to 4 actively growing plants located near the soil samples the bark was quickly removed they were sealed in a glass bottle all samples were numbered and stored in a frozen state 15 moisture of soil and twig xylem samples was extracted with an automated cryogenic vacuum distillation system li 2100 lica united technology limited china to yield samples of soil water and twig xylem water water extraction rate of 99 for stable isotopic analysis in addition roots of c camphora within each 10 cm of soil cores were collected sealed in a glass bottle and stored a temperature of 4 c root samples were obtained 10 times during the field study period we assumed that only roots less than 2 mm diameter are transporting roots jackson et al 1997 after drying all roots with diameter 2 mm were selected for weighing and the root distribution was calculated the results show that the roots of c camphora are concentrated within the depth range of 0 60 cm 72 3 in addition to the soil and twig xylem samples samples of precipitation 0 1 mm were collected at 08 00 and 20 00 beijing time in the study area on a rainy day abiding by the precipitation observation standard formulated by the local meteorological department the mean air temperature and precipitation during the rainfall period were also recorded precipitation samples including rain and snow samples were collected from a collector modified by a siphon rain gauge the collector comprised a funnel 6 cm diameter connected to a glass bottle with a plastic tube snow samples were sealed to glass bottles and were fully melted indoor they were then measured by volumn and stored wu et al 2015 because the glass bottle for collecting precipitation was sealed and the collection process was completed rapidly evaporation has been effectively avoided from april 2017 to january 2019 groundwater samples were collected from a well 20 m deep with the groundwater level at 18 m 30 m away from the plot the collection frequency was consistent with that of the soil samples precipitation and groundwater samples were sealed in 30 ml polyethylene vials numbered and stored at a temperature of 4 c in total 875 soil water samples 69 twig xylem water samples 365 precipitation samples and 57 groundwater samples were collected during the study period all water samples were filtered and then analyzed using a cavity ring down spectroscopy crds isotopic water analyzer model 35ep los gatos research inc usa isotopic ratios are expressed using the conventional delta notation 1 δ sample r sample r v smow 1 1000 where r sample and r v smow are the isotope molar ratios of heavy to light isotopes e g 2h 1h 18o 16o in water samples and in vienna standard mean ocean water v smow respectively the accuracy of the crds analyzer is 0 2 for δ18o and 0 6 for δ2h notably due to the occurrence of methanol in twig xylem water but not in the soil samples which would affect the isotopic analyses correction was required for the original isotopic data from twig xylem water the correction process followed luo et al 2019 the mean values of δ2h and δ18o in precipitation and soil water were calculated using the weighted average precipitation and soil water content for the corresponding period the mean values of all other variables refer to the arithmetic mean for the corresponding period according to the distribution characteristics of the stable isotopic compositions in soil water the soil profile 0 130 cm was divided into six layers 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 90 cm and 90 130 cm for isotopic analysis 2 3 soil water content soil temperature and micrometeorological data the soil volumetric water content and soil temperature were automatically monitored from february 2017 using a frequency domain reflectometry fdr system rwet 100 xi an saimorui environmental technology limited china installed near the sample trees the probes were located at 10 cm intervals to the depth of 100 cm the monitoring accuracy of soil volumetric water content and soil temperature was 2 5 and 0 5 c respectively the sampling interval was 1 h in addition soil moisture monitoring data were corrected using the drying and weighing method meteorological data including precipitation and air temperature were acquired by a micro automatic weather station weatherhawk 232 usa installed in an open area 50 m from the stand starting in december 2016 with a collection interval of 30 min land surface evaporation was based on the daily reanalysis dataset era interim of the european centre medium range weather forecasts ecmwf with a grid accuracy of 0 125 0 125 between january 2017 and august 2019 2 4 the mixsir model the mixsir model is a mathematical model proposed by moore and semmens 2008 based on the bayesian model principle to calculate the contribution ratio of each source to the mixture which is then applied to the quantitative simulation of plant water uptake in the field of ecohydrology based on the multi source linear mixing model the spatial heterogeneity of isotopic composition of plant xylem water and potential water sources was fully considered in the mixsir model wang et al 2019 the mean value and standard deviation of isotopic composition in plant xylem water and potential water sources were taken into account when the model was run for this study the fractionation coefficient was set to 0 assuming no isotopic fractionation during root water uptake the number of iterations was set as 1 000 000 times if the contribution rate of each water source converges and the posterior density is less than 0 01 the modelling is considered successful the calculation principle of the model can be expressed as 2 δ x b i 1 n f i δ x i c i 1 i 1 n f i where x and b represent the 2h or 18o and its standard deviation in plant xylem water respectively i represents the i th soil layer and n represents the total number of soil layers x i and c i represent 2h or 18o of soil water and its standard deviation in the i soil layers respectively fi represents the fraction of plant water uptake from the i th soil layer 3 results 3 1 temporal variation of environmental variables the daily variations of precipitation air temperature land surface evaporation and soil volumetric water content θ in the study area from march 2017 to august 2019 are illustrated in fig 2 daily precipitation ranges from 0 2 to 146 4 mm during the summer monsoon from april to september the cumulative precipitation represents 69 6 of the total precipitation and mean daily precipitation is 15 2 mm on rainy days during the winter monsoon from october to march the cumulative precipitation contributes 30 4 of the total precipitation and mean daily precipitation is only 6 3 mm on rainy days daily temperature ranges from 2 6 to 33 4 c during the observation period the mean temperature in the summer monsoon and in the winter monsoon are 24 7 and 10 1 respectively daily evaporation ranges from 0 3 to 6 8 mm with an average of 2 7 mm the seasonal variation is largely consistent with temperature the mean evaporation in the summer monsoon and in the winter monsoon are 4 0 mm and 1 5 mm respectively mean θ within the soil depth interval of 0 100 cm varies from 28 0 to 38 8 lower θ usually occurs between july and october which is related to intense soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration θ increases with depth but the range of variation and the standard deviation both decrease with depth compared with deeper depths θ within the 0 20 cm soil layer is more sensitive to changes in atmospheric environmental factors for example it increases rapidly on rainy days and decreases rapidly under conditions of continuous high temperature and drought 3 2 seasonal variations of the isotopic composition in different water pools since the temporal variations of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes are mainly consistent using δ18o solely to identify the daily variations of the stable isotopic composition is reasonable the daily variations of the δ18o of precipitation soil water groundwater and twig xylem water during the observation period are shown in fig 3 δ18o in precipitation varies from 13 32 to 4 23 with a precipitation weighted mean of 6 52 and standard deviation sd of 3 27 influenced by different water vapor sources in the monsoon region the mean δ18o in precipitation is 7 28 in the summer monsoon and 4 79 in the winter monsoon the maximum and minimum of monthly mean δ18o in precipitation occur in april 3 10 and september 10 80 respectively in addition to the influence of large scale circulation δ18o in precipitation is also related to precipitation intensity and size this is exemplified by several precipitation events with δ18o 1 occurring from march to may with a mean size of 0 9 mm δ18o in soil water varies from 12 56 to 2 25 the mean 1sd the same format is also used below of the δ18o of soil water at soil depths of 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm 90 cm and 130 cm are 6 68 2 58 7 24 2 31 7 47 1 27 7 36 1 16 and 7 30 0 99 respectively which are lower than those in precipitation the mean δ18o in soil water decreases first and then increases with depth while the sd gradually decreases although less variable in magnitude the seasonal variation of δ18o in shallow soil water 0 60 cm depth is similar to that in precipitation with a specific time lag for example the maximum monthly mean δ18o values in soil water at the depths of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm all occur in may ranging from 6 73 to 3 27 in addition the minimum monthly mean δ18o values respectively occur in september october and december ranging from 9 79 to 8 72 however seasonal variation of δ18o in deep soil water 60 130 cm depth is very weak only two obvious variations occurred in the continuous heavy precipitation events in may to june of 2017 and may to june of 2019 respectively the results show that precipitation replenishes shallow soil water within a season the deep soil water retains more isotopic information in precipitation which had accumulated over a period beyond a season with a relatively long residence time δ18o in groundwater ranges from 6 83 to 5 41 mean of 6 16 0 38 compared with precipitation and soil water there is a narrow seasonal range of variation of the stable isotope composition of groundwater reflecting its relatively large depth and long resident time δ18o in twig xylem water ranges from 9 40 to 3 30 6 51 1 52 there is a pronounced seasonal variation of δ18o in twig xylem water and the maximum and minimum monthly mean δ18o values occur in may 4 31 and october 8 54 respectively lagging behind precipitation δ18o by 1 month the correlation coefficients r of δ18o in twig xylem water with that in soil water at the depths of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm are 0 84 0 88 0 83 and 0 42 p 0 001 respectively this indicates a close hydraulic linkage between twig xylem water and soil water at different depths within the interval of 0 60 cm 3 3 relationship between δ2h and δ18o in different water pools with reference to the definition of the meteoric water line mwl craig 1961 the linear relationship between δ2h and δ18o of local meteoric precipitation soil water groundwater and twig xylem water are here defined respectively as lmwl swl groundwater line gwl and twig xylem water line xwl comparison of the water line characteristics of different water pools enables us to determine the regional hydrometeorological conditions to assess the contributions of different environmental factors and to analyze transformations among different water pools hua et al 2019 the datapoint distributions and water lines of δ2h versus δ18o in different water pools in the study area are illustrated in fig 4 the lmwl calculated from the measured data is δ2h 8 24δ18o 15 81 and its slope and intercept are both greater than those of the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 reflecting the warm and humid climatic characteristics of the east asian monsoon region wu et al 2015 as precipitation replenishes soil water its stable isotopic composition directly influences the soil water twig xylem water and groundwater are both supplied by soil water it is expected a close relationship between stable isotopic composition in different water pools for woodland where canopy interception and litter retention are common only precipitation exceeding a certain intensity contributes to soil water replenishment small precipitation events p 4 mm in this study can only influence the surface soil water content a change in surface soil moisture 1 and it will not affect the soil water content below 10 cm depth however according to fig s1 in the supplementary material the lmwl is greatly affected by small precipitation events after a removal of small events the slope and intercept of the lmwl increase significantly and tend to be less variable in general topsoil is recharged first by precipitation only when the storage change of surface soil moisture is larger than 0 is precipitation regarded as effective precipitation in woodland heisler white et al 2008 as the data of surface soil moisture content θs was collected daily the change in surface soil moisture denoted δθs is calculated according to the difference between θs of two consecutive days the result shows that for large precipitation events daily precipitation 25 mm δθs remains stable fig 5 this is likley because during such events soil at the surface quickly becomes saturated in order to accurately calculate the correlation between δθs and daily precipitation p and to estimate the effective precipitation in the study area only rainfall events with daily precipitation 25 mm during the period were analyzed namely abnormal values of δθs impacted by heavy rainfall events were excluded the regression equation for the relationship between δθs and precipitation is shown below 4 δθ s 0 11 p 0 41 r 0 70 n 844 there is a significant positive correlation between δθs and p with r values reaching 0 70 p 0 001 showing that the surface soil moisture responds very sensitively to precipitation from the intercept of the above regression equation it is estimated that surface soil loses moisture on average by 0 41 on rainless days when p 3 7 mm δθs 0 surface soil moisture maintains a balance therefore 3 7 mm is regarded as the lower bound of an effective precipitation event for soil water replenishment in the study area it can be seen from fig 4 that the slope and intercept of the lmwlp 3 7 δ2h 8 71δ18o 19 18 calculated from 212 effective rainfall events are higher than those of the lmwl the data points n 68 in the scatter plot of δ2h versus δ18o in soil water at different depths are all located to the lower right of the lmwlp 3 7 and gradually become more clustered towards the lmwlp 3 7 with increasing depth this indicates that the stable isotopes in soil water at different depths have undergone evaporative fractionation to different degrees in the process of soil water replenishment from precipitation comparison of the lmwlp 3 7 with the swls for different soil layers indicates that the slopes of the swls at all depths are higher than that of the lmwlp 3 7 and that the intercepts of the swls at all depths are lower than that of the lmwlp 3 7 except for those at the soil depths of 40 60 cm and 60 90 cm the data points of δ2h versus δ18o in groundwater are mainly above those for soil water and closer to the lmwlp 3 7 although the slope and intercept of the gwl δ2h 5 56δ18o 1 88 n 57 are much smaller than those of lmwlp 3 7 and swls for each soil layer this does not necessarily indicate that the stable isotopes in groundwater had experienced evaporative fractionation it may indicate surface water and groundwater interactions in this low lying humid basin floor the data points in the scatter plot of δ2h versus δ18o in twig xylem water are mainly below those of soil water and the slope and intercept of the xwl δ2h 8 33δ18o 8 05 n 69 are lower than those of the swl and the lmwlp 3 7 hence the distribution characteristics of δ2h versus δ18o in soil water groundwater and twig xylem water reveal that there are likely at least two water pools in soil water mobile water and tightly bound water brooks et al 2010 and their stable isotopic composition isdifferent 3 4 variations of lc excess in different water pools the deviation between δ2h and the lmwl in the dual isotope space is defined by the line conditioned excess denoted as lc excess which can be used to infer the evaporation fractionation of different water pools hasselquist et al 2018 hervé fernández et al 2016 landwehr et al 2014 the calculation formula is as follows 5 lc excess sample δ 2 h sample a δ 18 o sample b where a and b are the slope and intercept of the lmwl and δ2hsample and δ18osample are the stable isotopic ratios in the samples during the observation period mean lc excess in the water pools derived from precipitation was usually less than 0 due to the evaporative fractionation of stable isotopes sprenger et al 2017 the values of lc excess in different water pools were calculated according to the lmwlp 3 7 using eq 5 the magnitudes of mean lc excess in different water pools are illustrated as box plots fig 6 b the mean lc excess in groundwater 1 61 is close to that in precipitation indicating that the stable isotopes in groundwater are little affected by evaporative fractionation as evidence for the decrease of soil evaporation with depth lc excess in soil water increases with depth mean lc excess in the surface soil water is substantially lower than at other depths indicating that soil evaporation in the studied woodland is greatest within the 0 10 cm depth interval the lc excess in the 90 130 cm soil water is close to that of groundwater which indicates that there is likely a hydraulic linkage between them in fig 6 it can be seen that lc excess in precipitation is lower in summer and higher in winter with the maximum and minimum monthly mean lc excess occurring in december 4 18 and july 4 73 respectively the lc excess of soil water in each layer within the 0 60 cm depth interval lags that of precipitation by 1 3 months with an obvious seasonal variation more specifically the maximum monthly mean lc excess in soil water at the depth intervals of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm occurs during february to may ranging from 2 21 to 0 70 and the minimum occurs during august to october ranging from 13 95 to 6 81 however the seasonal variations of lc excess in deep soil water and in groundwater are not significant compared with other water pools the seasonal variation of lc excess in twig xylem water is complex low and high values of lc excess occur mainly during march may and june august respectively 3 5 water sources apportionment with the mixsir model fig 7 shows the relative contributions of soil water sources in each layer to c camphora calculated by the mixsir model based on δ2h the shallow and deep soil water contributions to c camphora varied from 52 95 to 82 61 and from 17 39 to 47 05 respectively during the whole observation period from july to september when seasonal drought occurs frequently in the study area the deep soil water contributions to c camphora ranged from 44 55 to 47 05 but they were less than 35 79 in other months based on δ18o the shallow and deep soil water contributions to c camphora varied from 44 10 to 83 54 and from 16 46 to 55 90 respectively during the whole observation period from july to september the deep soil water contributions to c camphora were 43 82 55 90 but they were less than 37 79 in other months compared with calculation results based on δ2h using the mixsir model the results based on δ18o suggest a larger surface 0 10 cm soil water contribution in winter and spring december to may 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of the stable isotopic composition of soil water and precipitation in general the stable isotopes in evaporating water pools derived from precipitation are more enriched than those in precipitation gibson et al 2008 however in the present study we found that there are times notably during the winter monsoon where δ18o in soil water is more depleted than that in precipitation in the study area and the mean value of δ18o in soil water at different depths is lower than that in precipitation the same phenomenon was observed in loess tableland areas cheng and liu 2012 and in the hohhot region in the central and western parts of inner mongolia autonomous region which has a continental monsoon climate liu et al 2016 cheng and liu 2012 suggested that this was related to the local climatic characteristics and seasonal variations in the stable isotopic composition of precipitation liu et al 2016 considered that there was seasonal soil water replenishment and observed that the stable isotopic composition in soil water was similar to that in precipitation during the replenishment season based on the long term continuous observation data we found that soil water was mainly supplied by the summer monsoon precipitation with low isotopic value precipitation weighted average δ18o of 7 28 which was close to mean δ18o of soil water at all depths the cumulative precipitation in the summer monsoon represented 69 6 of the total precipitation and mean daily precipitation was 15 2 mm on rainy days in contrast precipitation with higher isotopic value precipitation weighted average δ18o of 4 79 in the winter season contributed less to soil water the cumulative precipitation contributed 30 4 to the total precipitation and the mean daily precipitation was only 6 3 mm on rainy days in addition the statistical results shown in fig s2 depicts the characteristics of accumulated precipitation mean daily precipitation and precipitation frequency within a specific interval of δ18o in precipitation in the supplementary material indicate that the 18o in precipitation tended to be depleted with increasing daily precipitation which was usually lower than that of soil water within the 0 130 cm interval mean δ18o of 7 27 during heavy rainfall events mean daily precipitation of 20 0 mm although the number of heavy rainfall events comprised only 24 4 of all rainfall events the amount of precipitation exceeded 45 8 of the total precipitation in addition the penetration rate of precipitation through the woodland canopy increases logarithmically with precipitation pei et al 2018 this indicates that the small precipitation with high isotopic value is more likely intercepted by the canopy therefore the large precipitation contributes more to soil water affecting the isotopic composition of soil water 4 2 correlations of δ18o in cumulative precipitation with δ18o in soil water twig xylem water and groundwater it can be seen in fig 3 that δ18o in shallow soil water 0 60 cm and in twig xylem water have similar seasonal variation trends with that in precipitation with a certain degree of lag in this section we discuss the relationship of the isotopes between cumulative antecedent precipitation and different water pools due to the observation frequency of stable isotopes of soil water twig xylem water and groundwater at an average of 2 times a month δ18o in water pools mentioned above were averaged per half month that is each month can be divided into two parts and we analyzed the correlation coefficient r of δ18o in cumulative precipitation with δ18o in soil water twig xylem water and groundwater the results are shown in fig 8 the r curves of δ18o in cumulative precipitation with soil water and twig xylem water are unimodal the r values of δ18o in cumulative precipitation with δ18o in soil water at 0 60 cm depth and twig xylem water range from 0 49 to 0 91 p 0 001 specifically the r values of δ18o in cumulative precipitation with δ18o in soil water 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm and twig xylem water reached to the peak in 0 5 1 1 5 2 and 1 month respectively the r value between δ18o in cumulative precipitation and δ18o in soil water below 60 cm is not significant at the 0 01 level and the r value peaks in 3 3 5 months the r value between δ18o in cumulative precipitation and δ18o in groundwater is very small without an obvious peak in summary the δ18o of cumulative precipitation are closely related to shallow soil water and twig xylem water rather than deep soil water and groundwater with increasing soil depth the cumulative time for the peak r value between δ18o in antecedent precipitation and δ18o in soil water gradually increases which reflects the increase of the average renewal time of soil water the r curve between twig xylem water and shallow soil water is similar which indicates that c camphora grows by primarily using the shallow soil water in the whole observation period this is consistent with the result from fig 7 4 3 comparison of the swl and lmwl numerous observations have shown that influenced by the evaporative enrichment of stable isotopes in soil water the slope of the swl in inland areas at middle and high latitudes is generally lower than that of the lmwl benettin et al 2018 gibson et al 2008 sprenger et al 2018 however several surveys in east asian monsoon regions have produced the opposite result wu et al 2018 yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 namely that the slope of the swl is greater than that of the lmwl zhang et al 2015 attributed this to soil water being derived more from previous precipitation in contrast wu et al 2018 thought that the evaporative fractionation of soil water isotopes was weaker than that of precipitation due to the vegetation cover and the effect of the methods used for collecting soil water our results indicate that although precipitation determines the main characteristics of the swl it is not the reason why the slope of the swl is higher than that of the lmwl the occurrence of this phenomenon is related to seasonal variations of the stable isotopes in precipitation and to evaporative enrichment of stable isotopes in soil water influenced by the seasonality of stable isotopes in precipitation stable isotopic ratios and lc excess in soil water are also characterized by marked seasonal variations since soil evaporation is cumulative the effects of accumulated atmospheric evaporation e and accumulated temperature ta during the preceding period should be considered taking the median of the δ18o of soil water as the boundary at different depths the mean lc excess mean e mean ta e and ta have the same cumulative time and the swl in the low value range median δ18o and in the high value range median δ18o in soil water at each soil depth were calculated and the results are listed in table 1 note that e and ta during the preceding 30 d 60 d and 90 d correspond to the depth ranges of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 cm respectively according to the correlations of lc excess in soil water with e and ta in the preceding periods increased with the number of accumulated days and then gradually stabilized figure not shown except for the 60 90 cm depth interval the mean e and mean ta in the low value part of the range of stable isotopic composition in soil water at all depths are higher than those in the high value range while the mean lc excess in the low value range is lower than that in the high value range the foregoing analysis has shown that relatively low stable isotopic ratios in water in the soil layers mainly occur in the warm season with higher e and ta and the slope as well as the intercept of swl in the low value range are obviously lower due to the stronger evaporative enrichment and vice versa therefore the deviations of the data points from the lmwlp 3 7 located in the low δ value range are greater than those in the high δ value range in dual isotope space so that the slopes of the swl at all depths are greater than that of the lmwlp 3 7 moreover due to the evaporative enrichment of water stable isotopes during the process of soil water replenishment all of the swls are biased towards the right side of the lmwlp 3 7 and thus the intercepts of most of the swls are lower than that of the lmwl nevertheless for the 40 60 cm and 60 90 cm depth intervals very high swl slopes 9 50 and 9 24 respectively cause the right end of the water line to turn upwards and thus both intercepts of the swl 20 55 and 19 40 exceed the value of 19 18 for the lmwlp 3 7 in this study we also analyzed the characteristics of the swl and lmwl in two sampling cycles from march 2017 to february 2018 and from march 2018 to february 2019 we found that the slopes of the swl in both sampling cycles were higher than that of lmwl which was also caused by the inverse seasonal variation of precipitation stable isotopes and soil evaporation in conclusion a soil water isotopic distribution model in dual isotope space can be established fig 9 fig 9a reflects the scattered distribution of the stable isotopes of soil water in this study area while fig 9b shows the region where heavy isotopes in precipitation are enriched in warm season and depleted in cold season this model clearly shows that the inverse seasonal variation of precipitation stable isotopes and soil water evaporation results in the difference of the swl slope compared to the lmwl slope between the two regions for regions with low δ value in warm season and high δ value in cold season we cannot determine the strength of isotopic fractionation only based on the dual isotope line slope of the water that has undergone evaporation because the influence of seasonal variations cannot be ignored 4 4 water sources contribution to c camphora the water use sources of c camphora are affected by the distribution characteristics of root system the root distribution of c camphora at 0 60 cm depth is 72 3 in this study area which makes it use more water from the shallow soil layer than the deep soil layer through the mixsir model based on δ2h and δ18o the mean contributions of the shallow soil water to c camphora are 66 41 and 67 22 respectively in addition the water use sources of c camphora are also related to the soil water condition in july september there is large water demand of c camphora strong soil evaporation and less precipitation which results in a deficit of soil moisture the shallow soil water usually is depleted quicker than the deep when the shallow soil water is insufficient the deep soil water contributions to c camphora increases to 50 through the deep root system the results indicate that the water source of c camphora varies seasonally that is from a wet to dry period the water use of c camphora changes from shallow to deep soil similar results are reported by mccole and stern 2007 and yang et al 2015 mccole and stern 2007 found that the water sources of juniperus were from deep moisture in the dry summer and from shallow soil water in the wet winter by studying the water use tendencies of pinus massoniana pinus elliottii and cunninghamia lanceolata in the east asian monsoon region yang et al 2015 concluded that all three trees used deep soil water during the drought period and shallow soil water during the non drought period c camphora uptakes more water from the deep soil water with high isotopic value in july september and mainly uses the shallow soil water with high isotopic value in other months therefore this seasonal variation of water use may result in the mean δ18o in twig xylem water higher than that in soil water in addition when the water potential of plant roots remains unchanged they tend to obtain soil water except gravity water with high stable isotopic values from within the larger soil pores brooks et al 2010 gierke et al 2016 it has been reported that the stable isotopes of soil water within the coarse pore space extracted by mechanical centrifugation ma et al 2019 orlowski et al 2016b and a low tension lysimeter zhao et al 2013 were more enriched than those of soil water extracted by cryogenic vacuum distillation extraction this characteristic of water uptake in plant roots may cause the 18o in twig xylem water to be more enriched than 2h leading to lower lc excess in twig xylem water compared to soil water 5 conclusions the results of this study indicate that at the study site precipitation events need to be more than 3 7 mm to contribute to soil water replenishment the stable isotopic composition of soil water at different depths and twig xylem water of c camphora plots below lmwlp 3 7 in the dual isotope space suggesting some evaporation effects from precipitation to soil moisture the line conditioned excess values of xylem water fall within the range of soil moisture but beyond that of the precipitation water the isotopic composition of shallow soil water is positively correlated with that of antecedent precipitation within two months so is the xylem water these patterns of isotopic signal propagation from precipitation to soil and xylem water delineate a clear pathway of water transfer in this soil and plant continuum the isotopic composition of soil water in the dual isotope space show a line with a slope larger than that of lmwl our analysis suggests that this is due to the situation that precipitation in warm season with a larger evaporative demand is more depleted with heavy isotopes i e more negative delta values than that in cold season when the evaporative demand is low therefore it is not feasible to determine the soil water evaporative fraction by the water line method this calls for caution in using such a method which has been applied in some published studies the result from the mixsir model indicates that c camphora mainly uses shallow soil water 0 60 cm in most of the growing season this is also supported by that the isotopic composition of both xylem water and shallow soil moisture has similar lag correlation with that of accumulated precipitation however in july to september following a typical seasonal drought in july and august in the study area deep soil water 60 130 cm contributes to c camphora water uptake for about 50 our study demonstrates that with continuous monitoring stable isotopic composition of water in the soil and plant continuum can provide independent and less ambiguous information for investigating

5274,the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic 2h and 18o tracer method has become an important means of studying water transfer between the atmosphere rivers and lakes soils plants and aquifers we conducted a study on the variations of the stable isotopes of water and the seasonal variations in water use of cinnamomum camphora in the soil plant atmosphere continuum in a c camphora woodland in changsha central southern china which lies within the monsoon region of east asia stable isotopes were monitored in precipitation soil water 0 130 cm depth groundwater twig xylem water of c camphora and at the same time relevant environmental variables soil water content and meteorological variables were measured from march 2017 to august 2019 the monitoring data were collated and analyzed to determine the variations of stable isotopes in different water pools and mutual exchanges the results indicate that daily precipitation p greater than 3 7 mm regarded as effective precipitation contributed to soil water replenishment isotopic composition of soil water and twig xylem water fell below the lmwlp 3 7 the local meteoric water line eliminated rainfall events with p 3 7 mm isotopic composition of shallow soil water 0 60 cm and twig xylem water was positively correlated with that of cumulative antecedent precipitation within two months these patterns of precipitation isotopic signal propagation delineate a clear pathway of water transfer in this soil and plant continuum the slope of the soil water line in the study area was higher than that of the lmwlp 3 7 because of the situation that precipitation in warm season with a larger evaporative demand is more depleted with heavy isotopes i e more negative delta values than that in cold season when the evaporative demand is low therefore it was not feasible to determine the strength of isotopic fractionation based on the isotopic water line method according to the mixsir model c camphora water uptake mainly sourced from shallow soil water during the observation period however in july september when soil was dry deep soil water 60 130 cm contributed to c camphora water uptake for 50 these findings improve our understanding of the water cycle of the soil plant atmosphere continuum in the east asian monsoon region keywords east asian monsoon region stable isotopes precipitation soil water xylem water plant water sources 1 introduction the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac transfers water between the pedosphere atmosphere and biosphere thus the spac water transfer is an important issue in soil science ecology and hydrology in spac soil moisture storage replenished by infiltration from precipitation supplies water for plants and recharges groundwater chen et al 2017 gazis and feng 2004 song et al 2009 sprenger et al 2017 redistribution and mixing of soil moisture occur after precipitation infiltrates into a soil plants absorb soil water through the root system and then transport it through xylem to leaves for transpiration providing a means of returning water to the atmosphere evaporation of shallow soil moisture also returns water back to the atmosphere root water uptake and transpiration is the main water consumption in a forest ecosystem and therefore it is important to understand the processes of water transfer within the spac stable isotope analysis is able to reveal water movement and mixing between different water pools thus it has become an important means of studying water transfer in the spac dawson et al 2002 ma et al 2019 orlowski et al 2016a many studies have been conducted on the temporal variations of water stable isotopes of various pools the depth profiles of stable isotopes in soil water the relationship between the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic ratios δ2h and δ18o of different water pools and plant water use sources the stable isotopic composition of soil water can largely retain the precipitation isotopic signal and exhibits pronounced seasonal variations for example robertson and gazis 2006 found that the seasonal variation of stable isotopes of oxygen in soil water and precipitation in washington state usa was dependent on the regional climatic characteristics given the vertical variations of stable isotopes in soil water many researchers have found evidence of preferential flow in soil gazis and feng 2004 orlowski et al 2016a song et al 2011 yang and fu 2017 due to isotopic evaporative fractionation soil water that has undergone evaporation is more enriched in heavy isotopes than the water source as a result the slope of the linear relationship between δ2h and δ18o in the local meteoric water line lmwl craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 is generally higher than that of the soil water line swl gibson et al 2008 hervé fernández et al 2016 wang et al 2019 wenninger et al 2010 previous studies have shown that except for a few xerophytes or halophytes the stable isotopic composition especially 18o of stem xylem water does not undergo fractionation during the process of water uptake through the root system and transportation in plants therefore the stable isotopic composition in stem xylem water represents the integration of root uptake water sources brunel et al 1995 ellsworth and williams 2007 sprenger et al 2016 consequently the methodology based on mass conservation of stable isotopes enables both a qualitative analysis of the depths of plant water uptake and a quantitative estimation of the water use proportion from each water source nie et al 2012 phillips and gregg 2003 rong et al 2011 previous investigations of water stable isotopes in the spac were mainly in arid and semi arid regions brunel et al 1995 eggemeyer et al 2008 gierke et al 2016 yang and fu 2017 there have been few studies in humid and sub humid areas luo et al 2019 nie et al 2019 moreover many of these studies were generally based on data collected over a short period sprenger et al 2017 making them difficult to obtain a detailed view of stable isotopic composition and their relationships between precipitation soil water and stem xylem water several studies have shown that the intersection of the swl and the lmwl can be interpreted as the isotopic composition of the precipitation source water hervé fernández et al 2016 evaristo et al 2015 benettin et al 2018 found that when the isotopic variation in precipitation or the seasonality of evaporation fractionation of the evaporated samples were large the intersection of the swl and the lmwl deviated greatly from the true water source gibson et al 2008 simulated the swl slope of the upper soil water in south america africa australia and europe based on the craig gordon model which has a small range from 2 to 3 however the swls observed in different regions vary in a large range hervé fernández et al 2016 wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2013 comparison of the slopes between swl and lmwl has been applied to examine if soil water has undergone evaporation wan liu 2016 wang et al 2019 however other studies found that the slope of the swl was higher than that of the lmwl wu et al 2018 yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 which invalidate the approach of using swl to investigate soil evaporation therefore the isotopic water line approach for spac needs to be examined in this study we monitored stable isotopic composition in precipitation soil water 0 130 cm groundwater twig xylem water and relevant environmental variables soil water content soil temperature and meteorological variables in a cinnamomum camphora woodland in changsha a monsoonal region of east asia the study period was from march 2017 to august 2019 the monitoring data were collated and analyzed to determine the variations of stable isotopes in different water pools their influencing factors and their mutual relationships the objectives of the study were 1 to investigate precipitation isotopic signal propagation in a spac 2 to examine if the isotopic water line approach applies in the spac and 3 to determine the sources for plant water uptake 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the experiment was carried out in a woodland located in a suburb of changsha city hunan province in central southern china 28 22 8 02 n 112 45 42 91 e fig 1 the climate of the study area is monsoonal dominated by southwesterly and southeasterly winds during the summer monsoon april september and by northerly winds during the winter monsoon october march mean annual air temperature mean annual precipitation and mean annual evaporation are 17 4 c 1447 mm and 902 mm respectively the study plot is on a low angle 2 3 hillslope on relatively flat terrain with an elevation of 50 m above sea level the soil at the site is red earth with ph values from 6 0 to 7 0 within the depth interval of 0 130 cm of the soil profile the soil texture is silty clay loam with silt comprising more than 700 g kg 1 the soil bulk density ranges from 1 16 to 1 40 g cm 3 and increases with depth and the soil porosity ranges from 47 2 to 56 2 and decreases with depth evergreen broadleaf trees c camphora are dominant 90 in the plot and their average age and height are 13 yr and 9 m the lateral roots of c camphora are well developed other species include pinus massoniana cunninghamia lanceolata and sparse herbaceous plants the litter layer is 1 cm thick 2 2 sampling and measurements soil and twig xylem of c camphora were sampled at the target site an area of 20 40 m2 from march 2017 to august 2019 with a sampling frequency of 2 3 times per month three replicate soil samples were taken from three different cores at 10 cm intervals to the depth of 130 cm using a soil corer driven by a power operated hammer christie engineering pty ltd australia fresh soil samples were placed in 10 ml glass bottles for twig xylem sampling lignified branches 1 5 cm in diameter and 4 6 cm in length were cut from 3 to 4 actively growing plants located near the soil samples the bark was quickly removed they were sealed in a glass bottle all samples were numbered and stored in a frozen state 15 moisture of soil and twig xylem samples was extracted with an automated cryogenic vacuum distillation system li 2100 lica united technology limited china to yield samples of soil water and twig xylem water water extraction rate of 99 for stable isotopic analysis in addition roots of c camphora within each 10 cm of soil cores were collected sealed in a glass bottle and stored a temperature of 4 c root samples were obtained 10 times during the field study period we assumed that only roots less than 2 mm diameter are transporting roots jackson et al 1997 after drying all roots with diameter 2 mm were selected for weighing and the root distribution was calculated the results show that the roots of c camphora are concentrated within the depth range of 0 60 cm 72 3 in addition to the soil and twig xylem samples samples of precipitation 0 1 mm were collected at 08 00 and 20 00 beijing time in the study area on a rainy day abiding by the precipitation observation standard formulated by the local meteorological department the mean air temperature and precipitation during the rainfall period were also recorded precipitation samples including rain and snow samples were collected from a collector modified by a siphon rain gauge the collector comprised a funnel 6 cm diameter connected to a glass bottle with a plastic tube snow samples were sealed to glass bottles and were fully melted indoor they were then measured by volumn and stored wu et al 2015 because the glass bottle for collecting precipitation was sealed and the collection process was completed rapidly evaporation has been effectively avoided from april 2017 to january 2019 groundwater samples were collected from a well 20 m deep with the groundwater level at 18 m 30 m away from the plot the collection frequency was consistent with that of the soil samples precipitation and groundwater samples were sealed in 30 ml polyethylene vials numbered and stored at a temperature of 4 c in total 875 soil water samples 69 twig xylem water samples 365 precipitation samples and 57 groundwater samples were collected during the study period all water samples were filtered and then analyzed using a cavity ring down spectroscopy crds isotopic water analyzer model 35ep los gatos research inc usa isotopic ratios are expressed using the conventional delta notation 1 δ sample r sample r v smow 1 1000 where r sample and r v smow are the isotope molar ratios of heavy to light isotopes e g 2h 1h 18o 16o in water samples and in vienna standard mean ocean water v smow respectively the accuracy of the crds analyzer is 0 2 for δ18o and 0 6 for δ2h notably due to the occurrence of methanol in twig xylem water but not in the soil samples which would affect the isotopic analyses correction was required for the original isotopic data from twig xylem water the correction process followed luo et al 2019 the mean values of δ2h and δ18o in precipitation and soil water were calculated using the weighted average precipitation and soil water content for the corresponding period the mean values of all other variables refer to the arithmetic mean for the corresponding period according to the distribution characteristics of the stable isotopic compositions in soil water the soil profile 0 130 cm was divided into six layers 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 90 cm and 90 130 cm for isotopic analysis 2 3 soil water content soil temperature and micrometeorological data the soil volumetric water content and soil temperature were automatically monitored from february 2017 using a frequency domain reflectometry fdr system rwet 100 xi an saimorui environmental technology limited china installed near the sample trees the probes were located at 10 cm intervals to the depth of 100 cm the monitoring accuracy of soil volumetric water content and soil temperature was 2 5 and 0 5 c respectively the sampling interval was 1 h in addition soil moisture monitoring data were corrected using the drying and weighing method meteorological data including precipitation and air temperature were acquired by a micro automatic weather station weatherhawk 232 usa installed in an open area 50 m from the stand starting in december 2016 with a collection interval of 30 min land surface evaporation was based on the daily reanalysis dataset era interim of the european centre medium range weather forecasts ecmwf with a grid accuracy of 0 125 0 125 between january 2017 and august 2019 2 4 the mixsir model the mixsir model is a mathematical model proposed by moore and semmens 2008 based on the bayesian model principle to calculate the contribution ratio of each source to the mixture which is then applied to the quantitative simulation of plant water uptake in the field of ecohydrology based on the multi source linear mixing model the spatial heterogeneity of isotopic composition of plant xylem water and potential water sources was fully considered in the mixsir model wang et al 2019 the mean value and standard deviation of isotopic composition in plant xylem water and potential water sources were taken into account when the model was run for this study the fractionation coefficient was set to 0 assuming no isotopic fractionation during root water uptake the number of iterations was set as 1 000 000 times if the contribution rate of each water source converges and the posterior density is less than 0 01 the modelling is considered successful the calculation principle of the model can be expressed as 2 δ x b i 1 n f i δ x i c i 1 i 1 n f i where x and b represent the 2h or 18o and its standard deviation in plant xylem water respectively i represents the i th soil layer and n represents the total number of soil layers x i and c i represent 2h or 18o of soil water and its standard deviation in the i soil layers respectively fi represents the fraction of plant water uptake from the i th soil layer 3 results 3 1 temporal variation of environmental variables the daily variations of precipitation air temperature land surface evaporation and soil volumetric water content θ in the study area from march 2017 to august 2019 are illustrated in fig 2 daily precipitation ranges from 0 2 to 146 4 mm during the summer monsoon from april to september the cumulative precipitation represents 69 6 of the total precipitation and mean daily precipitation is 15 2 mm on rainy days during the winter monsoon from october to march the cumulative precipitation contributes 30 4 of the total precipitation and mean daily precipitation is only 6 3 mm on rainy days daily temperature ranges from 2 6 to 33 4 c during the observation period the mean temperature in the summer monsoon and in the winter monsoon are 24 7 and 10 1 respectively daily evaporation ranges from 0 3 to 6 8 mm with an average of 2 7 mm the seasonal variation is largely consistent with temperature the mean evaporation in the summer monsoon and in the winter monsoon are 4 0 mm and 1 5 mm respectively mean θ within the soil depth interval of 0 100 cm varies from 28 0 to 38 8 lower θ usually occurs between july and october which is related to intense soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration θ increases with depth but the range of variation and the standard deviation both decrease with depth compared with deeper depths θ within the 0 20 cm soil layer is more sensitive to changes in atmospheric environmental factors for example it increases rapidly on rainy days and decreases rapidly under conditions of continuous high temperature and drought 3 2 seasonal variations of the isotopic composition in different water pools since the temporal variations of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes are mainly consistent using δ18o solely to identify the daily variations of the stable isotopic composition is reasonable the daily variations of the δ18o of precipitation soil water groundwater and twig xylem water during the observation period are shown in fig 3 δ18o in precipitation varies from 13 32 to 4 23 with a precipitation weighted mean of 6 52 and standard deviation sd of 3 27 influenced by different water vapor sources in the monsoon region the mean δ18o in precipitation is 7 28 in the summer monsoon and 4 79 in the winter monsoon the maximum and minimum of monthly mean δ18o in precipitation occur in april 3 10 and september 10 80 respectively in addition to the influence of large scale circulation δ18o in precipitation is also related to precipitation intensity and size this is exemplified by several precipitation events with δ18o 1 occurring from march to may with a mean size of 0 9 mm δ18o in soil water varies from 12 56 to 2 25 the mean 1sd the same format is also used below of the δ18o of soil water at soil depths of 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm 90 cm and 130 cm are 6 68 2 58 7 24 2 31 7 47 1 27 7 36 1 16 and 7 30 0 99 respectively which are lower than those in precipitation the mean δ18o in soil water decreases first and then increases with depth while the sd gradually decreases although less variable in magnitude the seasonal variation of δ18o in shallow soil water 0 60 cm depth is similar to that in precipitation with a specific time lag for example the maximum monthly mean δ18o values in soil water at the depths of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm all occur in may ranging from 6 73 to 3 27 in addition the minimum monthly mean δ18o values respectively occur in september october and december ranging from 9 79 to 8 72 however seasonal variation of δ18o in deep soil water 60 130 cm depth is very weak only two obvious variations occurred in the continuous heavy precipitation events in may to june of 2017 and may to june of 2019 respectively the results show that precipitation replenishes shallow soil water within a season the deep soil water retains more isotopic information in precipitation which had accumulated over a period beyond a season with a relatively long residence time δ18o in groundwater ranges from 6 83 to 5 41 mean of 6 16 0 38 compared with precipitation and soil water there is a narrow seasonal range of variation of the stable isotope composition of groundwater reflecting its relatively large depth and long resident time δ18o in twig xylem water ranges from 9 40 to 3 30 6 51 1 52 there is a pronounced seasonal variation of δ18o in twig xylem water and the maximum and minimum monthly mean δ18o values occur in may 4 31 and october 8 54 respectively lagging behind precipitation δ18o by 1 month the correlation coefficients r of δ18o in twig xylem water with that in soil water at the depths of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm are 0 84 0 88 0 83 and 0 42 p 0 001 respectively this indicates a close hydraulic linkage between twig xylem water and soil water at different depths within the interval of 0 60 cm 3 3 relationship between δ2h and δ18o in different water pools with reference to the definition of the meteoric water line mwl craig 1961 the linear relationship between δ2h and δ18o of local meteoric precipitation soil water groundwater and twig xylem water are here defined respectively as lmwl swl groundwater line gwl and twig xylem water line xwl comparison of the water line characteristics of different water pools enables us to determine the regional hydrometeorological conditions to assess the contributions of different environmental factors and to analyze transformations among different water pools hua et al 2019 the datapoint distributions and water lines of δ2h versus δ18o in different water pools in the study area are illustrated in fig 4 the lmwl calculated from the measured data is δ2h 8 24δ18o 15 81 and its slope and intercept are both greater than those of the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 reflecting the warm and humid climatic characteristics of the east asian monsoon region wu et al 2015 as precipitation replenishes soil water its stable isotopic composition directly influences the soil water twig xylem water and groundwater are both supplied by soil water it is expected a close relationship between stable isotopic composition in different water pools for woodland where canopy interception and litter retention are common only precipitation exceeding a certain intensity contributes to soil water replenishment small precipitation events p 4 mm in this study can only influence the surface soil water content a change in surface soil moisture 1 and it will not affect the soil water content below 10 cm depth however according to fig s1 in the supplementary material the lmwl is greatly affected by small precipitation events after a removal of small events the slope and intercept of the lmwl increase significantly and tend to be less variable in general topsoil is recharged first by precipitation only when the storage change of surface soil moisture is larger than 0 is precipitation regarded as effective precipitation in woodland heisler white et al 2008 as the data of surface soil moisture content θs was collected daily the change in surface soil moisture denoted δθs is calculated according to the difference between θs of two consecutive days the result shows that for large precipitation events daily precipitation 25 mm δθs remains stable fig 5 this is likley because during such events soil at the surface quickly becomes saturated in order to accurately calculate the correlation between δθs and daily precipitation p and to estimate the effective precipitation in the study area only rainfall events with daily precipitation 25 mm during the period were analyzed namely abnormal values of δθs impacted by heavy rainfall events were excluded the regression equation for the relationship between δθs and precipitation is shown below 4 δθ s 0 11 p 0 41 r 0 70 n 844 there is a significant positive correlation between δθs and p with r values reaching 0 70 p 0 001 showing that the surface soil moisture responds very sensitively to precipitation from the intercept of the above regression equation it is estimated that surface soil loses moisture on average by 0 41 on rainless days when p 3 7 mm δθs 0 surface soil moisture maintains a balance therefore 3 7 mm is regarded as the lower bound of an effective precipitation event for soil water replenishment in the study area it can be seen from fig 4 that the slope and intercept of the lmwlp 3 7 δ2h 8 71δ18o 19 18 calculated from 212 effective rainfall events are higher than those of the lmwl the data points n 68 in the scatter plot of δ2h versus δ18o in soil water at different depths are all located to the lower right of the lmwlp 3 7 and gradually become more clustered towards the lmwlp 3 7 with increasing depth this indicates that the stable isotopes in soil water at different depths have undergone evaporative fractionation to different degrees in the process of soil water replenishment from precipitation comparison of the lmwlp 3 7 with the swls for different soil layers indicates that the slopes of the swls at all depths are higher than that of the lmwlp 3 7 and that the intercepts of the swls at all depths are lower than that of the lmwlp 3 7 except for those at the soil depths of 40 60 cm and 60 90 cm the data points of δ2h versus δ18o in groundwater are mainly above those for soil water and closer to the lmwlp 3 7 although the slope and intercept of the gwl δ2h 5 56δ18o 1 88 n 57 are much smaller than those of lmwlp 3 7 and swls for each soil layer this does not necessarily indicate that the stable isotopes in groundwater had experienced evaporative fractionation it may indicate surface water and groundwater interactions in this low lying humid basin floor the data points in the scatter plot of δ2h versus δ18o in twig xylem water are mainly below those of soil water and the slope and intercept of the xwl δ2h 8 33δ18o 8 05 n 69 are lower than those of the swl and the lmwlp 3 7 hence the distribution characteristics of δ2h versus δ18o in soil water groundwater and twig xylem water reveal that there are likely at least two water pools in soil water mobile water and tightly bound water brooks et al 2010 and their stable isotopic composition isdifferent 3 4 variations of lc excess in different water pools the deviation between δ2h and the lmwl in the dual isotope space is defined by the line conditioned excess denoted as lc excess which can be used to infer the evaporation fractionation of different water pools hasselquist et al 2018 hervé fernández et al 2016 landwehr et al 2014 the calculation formula is as follows 5 lc excess sample δ 2 h sample a δ 18 o sample b where a and b are the slope and intercept of the lmwl and δ2hsample and δ18osample are the stable isotopic ratios in the samples during the observation period mean lc excess in the water pools derived from precipitation was usually less than 0 due to the evaporative fractionation of stable isotopes sprenger et al 2017 the values of lc excess in different water pools were calculated according to the lmwlp 3 7 using eq 5 the magnitudes of mean lc excess in different water pools are illustrated as box plots fig 6 b the mean lc excess in groundwater 1 61 is close to that in precipitation indicating that the stable isotopes in groundwater are little affected by evaporative fractionation as evidence for the decrease of soil evaporation with depth lc excess in soil water increases with depth mean lc excess in the surface soil water is substantially lower than at other depths indicating that soil evaporation in the studied woodland is greatest within the 0 10 cm depth interval the lc excess in the 90 130 cm soil water is close to that of groundwater which indicates that there is likely a hydraulic linkage between them in fig 6 it can be seen that lc excess in precipitation is lower in summer and higher in winter with the maximum and minimum monthly mean lc excess occurring in december 4 18 and july 4 73 respectively the lc excess of soil water in each layer within the 0 60 cm depth interval lags that of precipitation by 1 3 months with an obvious seasonal variation more specifically the maximum monthly mean lc excess in soil water at the depth intervals of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm occurs during february to may ranging from 2 21 to 0 70 and the minimum occurs during august to october ranging from 13 95 to 6 81 however the seasonal variations of lc excess in deep soil water and in groundwater are not significant compared with other water pools the seasonal variation of lc excess in twig xylem water is complex low and high values of lc excess occur mainly during march may and june august respectively 3 5 water sources apportionment with the mixsir model fig 7 shows the relative contributions of soil water sources in each layer to c camphora calculated by the mixsir model based on δ2h the shallow and deep soil water contributions to c camphora varied from 52 95 to 82 61 and from 17 39 to 47 05 respectively during the whole observation period from july to september when seasonal drought occurs frequently in the study area the deep soil water contributions to c camphora ranged from 44 55 to 47 05 but they were less than 35 79 in other months based on δ18o the shallow and deep soil water contributions to c camphora varied from 44 10 to 83 54 and from 16 46 to 55 90 respectively during the whole observation period from july to september the deep soil water contributions to c camphora were 43 82 55 90 but they were less than 37 79 in other months compared with calculation results based on δ2h using the mixsir model the results based on δ18o suggest a larger surface 0 10 cm soil water contribution in winter and spring december to may 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of the stable isotopic composition of soil water and precipitation in general the stable isotopes in evaporating water pools derived from precipitation are more enriched than those in precipitation gibson et al 2008 however in the present study we found that there are times notably during the winter monsoon where δ18o in soil water is more depleted than that in precipitation in the study area and the mean value of δ18o in soil water at different depths is lower than that in precipitation the same phenomenon was observed in loess tableland areas cheng and liu 2012 and in the hohhot region in the central and western parts of inner mongolia autonomous region which has a continental monsoon climate liu et al 2016 cheng and liu 2012 suggested that this was related to the local climatic characteristics and seasonal variations in the stable isotopic composition of precipitation liu et al 2016 considered that there was seasonal soil water replenishment and observed that the stable isotopic composition in soil water was similar to that in precipitation during the replenishment season based on the long term continuous observation data we found that soil water was mainly supplied by the summer monsoon precipitation with low isotopic value precipitation weighted average δ18o of 7 28 which was close to mean δ18o of soil water at all depths the cumulative precipitation in the summer monsoon represented 69 6 of the total precipitation and mean daily precipitation was 15 2 mm on rainy days in contrast precipitation with higher isotopic value precipitation weighted average δ18o of 4 79 in the winter season contributed less to soil water the cumulative precipitation contributed 30 4 to the total precipitation and the mean daily precipitation was only 6 3 mm on rainy days in addition the statistical results shown in fig s2 depicts the characteristics of accumulated precipitation mean daily precipitation and precipitation frequency within a specific interval of δ18o in precipitation in the supplementary material indicate that the 18o in precipitation tended to be depleted with increasing daily precipitation which was usually lower than that of soil water within the 0 130 cm interval mean δ18o of 7 27 during heavy rainfall events mean daily precipitation of 20 0 mm although the number of heavy rainfall events comprised only 24 4 of all rainfall events the amount of precipitation exceeded 45 8 of the total precipitation in addition the penetration rate of precipitation through the woodland canopy increases logarithmically with precipitation pei et al 2018 this indicates that the small precipitation with high isotopic value is more likely intercepted by the canopy therefore the large precipitation contributes more to soil water affecting the isotopic composition of soil water 4 2 correlations of δ18o in cumulative precipitation with δ18o in soil water twig xylem water and groundwater it can be seen in fig 3 that δ18o in shallow soil water 0 60 cm and in twig xylem water have similar seasonal variation trends with that in precipitation with a certain degree of lag in this section we discuss the relationship of the isotopes between cumulative antecedent precipitation and different water pools due to the observation frequency of stable isotopes of soil water twig xylem water and groundwater at an average of 2 times a month δ18o in water pools mentioned above were averaged per half month that is each month can be divided into two parts and we analyzed the correlation coefficient r of δ18o in cumulative precipitation with δ18o in soil water twig xylem water and groundwater the results are shown in fig 8 the r curves of δ18o in cumulative precipitation with soil water and twig xylem water are unimodal the r values of δ18o in cumulative precipitation with δ18o in soil water at 0 60 cm depth and twig xylem water range from 0 49 to 0 91 p 0 001 specifically the r values of δ18o in cumulative precipitation with δ18o in soil water 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm and twig xylem water reached to the peak in 0 5 1 1 5 2 and 1 month respectively the r value between δ18o in cumulative precipitation and δ18o in soil water below 60 cm is not significant at the 0 01 level and the r value peaks in 3 3 5 months the r value between δ18o in cumulative precipitation and δ18o in groundwater is very small without an obvious peak in summary the δ18o of cumulative precipitation are closely related to shallow soil water and twig xylem water rather than deep soil water and groundwater with increasing soil depth the cumulative time for the peak r value between δ18o in antecedent precipitation and δ18o in soil water gradually increases which reflects the increase of the average renewal time of soil water the r curve between twig xylem water and shallow soil water is similar which indicates that c camphora grows by primarily using the shallow soil water in the whole observation period this is consistent with the result from fig 7 4 3 comparison of the swl and lmwl numerous observations have shown that influenced by the evaporative enrichment of stable isotopes in soil water the slope of the swl in inland areas at middle and high latitudes is generally lower than that of the lmwl benettin et al 2018 gibson et al 2008 sprenger et al 2018 however several surveys in east asian monsoon regions have produced the opposite result wu et al 2018 yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 namely that the slope of the swl is greater than that of the lmwl zhang et al 2015 attributed this to soil water being derived more from previous precipitation in contrast wu et al 2018 thought that the evaporative fractionation of soil water isotopes was weaker than that of precipitation due to the vegetation cover and the effect of the methods used for collecting soil water our results indicate that although precipitation determines the main characteristics of the swl it is not the reason why the slope of the swl is higher than that of the lmwl the occurrence of this phenomenon is related to seasonal variations of the stable isotopes in precipitation and to evaporative enrichment of stable isotopes in soil water influenced by the seasonality of stable isotopes in precipitation stable isotopic ratios and lc excess in soil water are also characterized by marked seasonal variations since soil evaporation is cumulative the effects of accumulated atmospheric evaporation e and accumulated temperature ta during the preceding period should be considered taking the median of the δ18o of soil water as the boundary at different depths the mean lc excess mean e mean ta e and ta have the same cumulative time and the swl in the low value range median δ18o and in the high value range median δ18o in soil water at each soil depth were calculated and the results are listed in table 1 note that e and ta during the preceding 30 d 60 d and 90 d correspond to the depth ranges of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 cm respectively according to the correlations of lc excess in soil water with e and ta in the preceding periods increased with the number of accumulated days and then gradually stabilized figure not shown except for the 60 90 cm depth interval the mean e and mean ta in the low value part of the range of stable isotopic composition in soil water at all depths are higher than those in the high value range while the mean lc excess in the low value range is lower than that in the high value range the foregoing analysis has shown that relatively low stable isotopic ratios in water in the soil layers mainly occur in the warm season with higher e and ta and the slope as well as the intercept of swl in the low value range are obviously lower due to the stronger evaporative enrichment and vice versa therefore the deviations of the data points from the lmwlp 3 7 located in the low δ value range are greater than those in the high δ value range in dual isotope space so that the slopes of the swl at all depths are greater than that of the lmwlp 3 7 moreover due to the evaporative enrichment of water stable isotopes during the process of soil water replenishment all of the swls are biased towards the right side of the lmwlp 3 7 and thus the intercepts of most of the swls are lower than that of the lmwl nevertheless for the 40 60 cm and 60 90 cm depth intervals very high swl slopes 9 50 and 9 24 respectively cause the right end of the water line to turn upwards and thus both intercepts of the swl 20 55 and 19 40 exceed the value of 19 18 for the lmwlp 3 7 in this study we also analyzed the characteristics of the swl and lmwl in two sampling cycles from march 2017 to february 2018 and from march 2018 to february 2019 we found that the slopes of the swl in both sampling cycles were higher than that of lmwl which was also caused by the inverse seasonal variation of precipitation stable isotopes and soil evaporation in conclusion a soil water isotopic distribution model in dual isotope space can be established fig 9 fig 9a reflects the scattered distribution of the stable isotopes of soil water in this study area while fig 9b shows the region where heavy isotopes in precipitation are enriched in warm season and depleted in cold season this model clearly shows that the inverse seasonal variation of precipitation stable isotopes and soil water evaporation results in the difference of the swl slope compared to the lmwl slope between the two regions for regions with low δ value in warm season and high δ value in cold season we cannot determine the strength of isotopic fractionation only based on the dual isotope line slope of the water that has undergone evaporation because the influence of seasonal variations cannot be ignored 4 4 water sources contribution to c camphora the water use sources of c camphora are affected by the distribution characteristics of root system the root distribution of c camphora at 0 60 cm depth is 72 3 in this study area which makes it use more water from the shallow soil layer than the deep soil layer through the mixsir model based on δ2h and δ18o the mean contributions of the shallow soil water to c camphora are 66 41 and 67 22 respectively in addition the water use sources of c camphora are also related to the soil water condition in july september there is large water demand of c camphora strong soil evaporation and less precipitation which results in a deficit of soil moisture the shallow soil water usually is depleted quicker than the deep when the shallow soil water is insufficient the deep soil water contributions to c camphora increases to 50 through the deep root system the results indicate that the water source of c camphora varies seasonally that is from a wet to dry period the water use of c camphora changes from shallow to deep soil similar results are reported by mccole and stern 2007 and yang et al 2015 mccole and stern 2007 found that the water sources of juniperus were from deep moisture in the dry summer and from shallow soil water in the wet winter by studying the water use tendencies of pinus massoniana pinus elliottii and cunninghamia lanceolata in the east asian monsoon region yang et al 2015 concluded that all three trees used deep soil water during the drought period and shallow soil water during the non drought period c camphora uptakes more water from the deep soil water with high isotopic value in july september and mainly uses the shallow soil water with high isotopic value in other months therefore this seasonal variation of water use may result in the mean δ18o in twig xylem water higher than that in soil water in addition when the water potential of plant roots remains unchanged they tend to obtain soil water except gravity water with high stable isotopic values from within the larger soil pores brooks et al 2010 gierke et al 2016 it has been reported that the stable isotopes of soil water within the coarse pore space extracted by mechanical centrifugation ma et al 2019 orlowski et al 2016b and a low tension lysimeter zhao et al 2013 were more enriched than those of soil water extracted by cryogenic vacuum distillation extraction this characteristic of water uptake in plant roots may cause the 18o in twig xylem water to be more enriched than 2h leading to lower lc excess in twig xylem water compared to soil water 5 conclusions the results of this study indicate that at the study site precipitation events need to be more than 3 7 mm to contribute to soil water replenishment the stable isotopic composition of soil water at different depths and twig xylem water of c camphora plots below lmwlp 3 7 in the dual isotope space suggesting some evaporation effects from precipitation to soil moisture the line conditioned excess values of xylem water fall within the range of soil moisture but beyond that of the precipitation water the isotopic composition of shallow soil water is positively correlated with that of antecedent precipitation within two months so is the xylem water these patterns of isotopic signal propagation from precipitation to soil and xylem water delineate a clear pathway of water transfer in this soil and plant continuum the isotopic composition of soil water in the dual isotope space show a line with a slope larger than that of lmwl our analysis suggests that this is due to the situation that precipitation in warm season with a larger evaporative demand is more depleted with heavy isotopes i e more negative delta values than that in cold season when the evaporative demand is low therefore it is not feasible to determine the soil water evaporative fraction by the water line method this calls for caution in using such a method which has been applied in some published studies the result from the mixsir model indicates that c camphora mainly uses shallow soil water 0 60 cm in most of the growing season this is also supported by that the isotopic composition of both xylem water and shallow soil moisture has similar lag correlation with that of accumulated precipitation however in july to september following a typical seasonal drought in july and august in the study area deep soil water 60 130 cm contributes to c camphora water uptake for about 50 our study demonstrates that with continuous monitoring stable isotopic composition of water in the soil and plant continuum can provide independent and less ambiguous information for investigating
