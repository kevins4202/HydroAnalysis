drought is a compounded and recurrent extreme climate event that consistently results in water deficits and consequently negatively impacts on human populations and economies and ecosystems in varied and multiple ways van vliet et al 2012 funk and shukla 2020 additionally drought is projected to increase both in intensity and frequency under climate change edenhofer and seyboth 2013 trenberth et al 2013 an increase in intensity and frequency of meteorological drought will weaken plant processes i e photosynthesis vanlerberghe et al 2016 and above and belowground plant respiration roland et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 water deficit will also reduce terrestrial ecosystem evapotranspiration joo et al 2016 wang et al 2017 through disturbing distribution of water balance and carbon and water cycles path furthermore ecosystem attributes e g plants biotic part and soil abiotic part are highly interconnected maestre et al 2016 reynolds et al 2007 schlesinger et al 1990 therefore changes in an attribute e g water cycling plant productivity and microbial communities induced by an increasing drought may trigger sequential changes in others reynolds et al 2007 rocha et al 2018 for example cutting down woodland in hubbard brook sample woodland in new hampshire usa raised 26 40 stream runoff due to vegetation variation resulted in decreasing transpiration that was the main mechanism of soil water reenters the atmosphere likens et al 1970 consequently the response of plants to drought reflects their complex regulatory mechanisms e g liu et al 2018 vicente serrano et al 2013 differences in plant species response to drought will determine different levels of resistance and resilience to water deficits and ultimately influence the impact type of a drought event e g slow

reflect how ecosystems respond to climate change e g liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2001 zhao et al 2020 in terrestrial ecosystems plant gpp and tr are tightly coupled at multiple scales and decreasing stomatal conductance maximum photochemical efficiency and quantum yield will cause a weakening effect on them in particular plant wue wue gpp tr defined as the amount of carbon fixed per unit of water transpired is widely used to measure the trade off between carbon uptake and water loss in terrestrial ecosystems and connect biological processes e g photosynthesis respiration and transpiration throughout the carbon and water cycle anower et al 2017 liu et al 2015 schoo et al 2016 consequently wue is uniquely advantageous for investigating the ecological response to drought in situ observations have suggested that ecosystem biomes can cope with water deficits by enhancing their wue ponce campos et al 2013 however certain regional and global studies have challenged this theory liu et al 2015 xue et al 2015 yang et al 2016 for example xu et al 2019 observed that mean annual wue decreased with an increase in the aridity index ai in arid regions in north china while wue increased in hype arid sub humid and humid regions under increasing drying trends liu et al 2018 reported that drought conditions in northeast china increased wue in cold temperate coniferous forests and temperate pine broadleaved mixed forests while warm temperate deciduous broad leaved forests under drought conditions had no significant response to wue zhao et al 2020 also determined that drought resulted in diverse effects on the wue of different vegetation types ecosystem e g cropland grassland forestland and shrubland under differing drought severity e g mild drought moderate drought and severe drought in southwest china as reported by vicente serrano et al 2013 the sensitivity of the response of vegetation to drought varies among different biomes and this has been confirmed by short response timescales in arid and humid biomes and long response timescales in semiarid and subhumid biomes consequently the wue of terrestrial ecosystems involves complex interactions in carbon and water cycles while underlying relevant mechanisms remain unclear the objectives of this study were i to quantify a long term meteorological drought event and subdivide the

characteristics e g functions of carbon uptake and loss of water during these different periods including gpp tr and wue i e the ratio of gpp tr and iii to analyze alterations in the sensitivity of gpp to precipitation p and transpiration tr under these different water statuses results from this study will help us to better understand the effects of drought on terrestrial ecosystems in temperate water limited basin which will subsequently allow for its protection and restoration 2 study site and materials 2 1 study site the yellow river flows through the tibetan plateau the loess plateau the north china plain and ultimately reaches the bohai sea fig 1 whose length is approximately 5400 km the yrb with a total land area of 79 500 km2 is characterized by a temperate continental climate of which northwest and western regions are semiarid and arid and its southeastern region is relatively humid the yrb is also characterized by two distinct seasons a wet warm hot summer and a dry cool cold winter which is typical of a temperate water limited basin liu et al 2016 basin charactistics above make the yrb an ideal region for studying the ecological effect of long term drought on the regional scales hydrometeorological conditions are complex and changeable in the yrb for example the whole basin exhibits unbalanced precipitation distribution patterns where precipitation over the past decade has increased in the central region and decreased in the southern region jiang et al 2020 li et al 2020 wang et al 2020 elevation gradually increases from the southeast to the northwest in yrb and there are variety of vegetation types under changeable hydro climatic and geological conditions notably the chinese loess plateau is mostly situated within the yrb fig 1 referred to as the loess plateau region lpr where has severe soil erosion due to low vegetation cover and summer rainstorms prevails li et al 2020 in order to restore vegetation cover and reduce soil erosion there several projects have been implemented namely the grain for green program gfgp mcvicar et al 2010 mcvicar et al 2008 which has also induced changes in local ecohydrological processes and alterations in regional hydrological cycles e g decreasing runoff and soil moisture in this context the terrestrial ecosystem expressed the complexity of response to drought at different spatiotemporal scales 2 2 data monthly gpp and tr estimates throughout 1982 2010 at a 0 5 spatial resolution were obtained from six ecosystem models in the multi scale synthesis and terrestrial model intercomparison project mstmip https nacp ornl gov mstmip shtml huntzinger et al 2013 including the biome bgc model running and hunt 1993 white et al 2000 the triplex model peng et al 2002 the dynamic land ecosystem model dlem tian et al 2010 the integrated science assessment model isam jain and yang 2005 the combined community land model clm 4 0 and the variable infiltration capacity vic model clm vic lawrence et al 2011 oleson et al 2010 as well as the canadian land surface scheme class verseghy 1991 verseghy et al 1993 the model simulations all follow the similar experimental design and more importantly are all driven with the same set of climate drivers while simulated outputs are not direct observations of carbon and water cycle they integrated our current understanding of carbon and water exchanges between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere zscheischler et al 2014 we integrated monthly gpp and tr data to annual scale and then improved data reliability by averaging the annual datasets from all six models this study used climate research unit cru gridded monthly p data at a 0 5 spatial resolution from 1961 to 2017 provided by the university of east anglia https lr1 uea ac uk cru data corresponding to the input of the model simulations monthly p data were integrated to obtain annual p and to identify long term meteorological drought 3 method 3 1 quantifying drought many indices have been proposed to monitor drought over the past several decades mishra et al 2010 however most of these indices were developed for specific aspects of drought bringing difficulties in the comparison between different drought types for example the palmer drought severity index pdsi was developed to quantify agricultural drought by focusing on soil moisture palmer 1965 the standardized precipitation index spi has been applied to quantify hydrological drought mckee et al 1993 and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 was proposed to quantify multi scalar hydrological drought additionally spi usually adopt different probability distribution functions to fit the data which may result in additional uncertainties the pdsi has the strong influence of calibration period while it carries limited utility in areas other than that used for calibration problems in spatial comparability and subjectivity in relating drought conditions to the values of the index alley 1984 soulé 1992 akinremi et al 1996 some recent studies have found that long term stable drought events have a significant effect on ecosystems globally stuart haëntjens et al 2018 yan et al 2020 p anomalies a relative value respective to the mean yang et al 2014 can directly reflect the meteorological drought caused by abnormal precipitation many studies had examined the applicability of precipitation anomaly in china e g tian et al 2015 han et al 2009 according to yang 2017 this method is more suitable for long term meteorological drought here we defined meteorological drought via p anomaly percentage first we calculated the annual p anomaly percentage eq 1 and then smoothed it using a 3 year moving window to avoid single wetter years that could potentially cause a break in long term drought sequences saft et al 2015 in this study long term meteorological drought was defined as a period with greater than seven consecutive years of smoothed negative anomalies concrete detail was shown in fig 2 1 i p a p p p 100 where ipa is the percentage precipitation anomaly p is annual precipitation mm a 1 p is annual average annual precipitation mm a 1 3 2 determining temporal trends using a linear fitted model the ordinary least square regression olsr method has been widely used to analyze temporal trends in hydrometeorological variables this regression method logically provides specific data point weighting such as precipitation and streamflow e g hughes and crawford 2012 liu et al 2008a yang and zhou 2014 which can be shown as follows 2 a x y 1 n x y x 2 1 n x 2 3 b y a x we employed this method in our study to explore temporal gpp tr and wue trends during three different periods which was tested at a 95 confidence

annual gpp wue and tr increased in the whole yrb from 1982 to 2010 at change rate of 1 03 cg m 2 a 2 0 4 mm a 2 and 0 0018 cg m 2 mm 1 a 1 respectively ii temporal gpp tr and wue trends were unevenly distributed moreover grid cells exhibiting increasing gpp tr and wue accounted for 73 77 49 23 and 78 33 of the whole yrb respectively while areas exhibiting increasing gpp or tr were located in west and east and decreasing wue mostly in the southern yrb iii regions exhibiting significant increasing gpp tr and wue trends p 0 05 accounted for 25 93 11 46 and 27 24 of the whole yrb with an average rate of 1 52 cg m 2 a 2 1 06 mm a 2 and 0 0078 cg m 2 mm 1 a 1 respectively finally iv regions exhibiting significant increasing gpp and tr trends p 0 05 followed similar abovementioned uneven distribution pattern notably temporal gpp and tr trends in the central region of the yrb were within the confines of the lpr moreover their decreasing trends of gpp and tr in the lpr were obvious and much more pronounced while significant increasing wue trends p 0 05 mainly derived from the central lpr fig 3 table 1 at the same time annual gpp and tr in the lpr exhibited increasing trends at a lower rate of 0 53 cg m 2 a 2 and 0 05 mm a 2 respectively while annual wue exhibited higher increasing trends at a rate of 0 0033 cg m 2 mm 1 a 1 compared to corresponding temporal trends for the whole yrb table 1 fig 4 4 2 ecological response to long term drought annual p anomalies were used to detect the long term drought event which commenced in 1990 and concluded in 2001 fig 2 the duration of the long term drought event was 12 years according to the long term drought event the whole 29 year study period was subdivided into three distinct periods a pre drought period 1982 1989 a drought period 1990 2001 and a recovery period 2002 2010 fig 5 simple liner regression model was applied to trend analysis of gpp tr and wue in the three periods temporal gpp tr and wue trends during the pre drought drought and recovery periods in the yrb showed that fig 5 gpp first decreased and then increased with slopes of 0 20 1 28 and 3 77 cg m 2 a 2 respectively illustrating that slope rates progressively increased from the drought period to recovery period for which a turning point occurred in 1990 fig 5b tr showed similar trends to gpp during all the three periods with slopes of 1 10 0 86 and 2 14 mm a 2 fig 5d respectively wue showed reverse trends first increasing and then decreasing throughout the three periods with slopes of 0 0047 0 0020 and 0 0056 cg m 2 mm 1 a 2 fig 5f respectively temporal gpp tr and wue trends for the pre drought drought and recovery periods in the lpr showed that fig 5 the gpp trend continuously increased at rates of 0 14 1 89 and 3 69 cg m 2 a 2 throughout the three periods fig 5a respectively tr also first decreased and then increased with slopes of 0 06 0 75 and 3 23 mm a 2 fig 5c respectively wue exhibited greater fluctuation first decreasing then increasing and finally decreasing once again with slopes of 9 74e 4 0 0032 and 0 01 cg m 2 mm 1 a 2 fig 5e respectively temporal gpp tr and wue trends reversed in 1990 in both the yrb and lpr except for gpp in the lpr and more significant gpp trends and wue trend were observed during the drought period in lpr fig 5 during the drought period wue exhibited the reverse trend between the yrb and the lpr table 2 provides the average gpp tr and wue values and results of significance of difference test for all the three periods i average p and tr yielded the lowest values during the drought period while average gpp and wue continuously increased from the pre drought period to recovery period in the yrb ii average gpp p and tr all yielded the lowest values during the drought period while wue yielded the highest value during the recovery period in the lpr iii all averaged value of yrb variables were greater than corresponding lpr variables except for wue iv differences of gpp p tr and wue between the three periods are all insignificant whose p value 0 05 except tr in yrb 4 3 gpp response to p and tr according to results of simple liner regression the response of gpp to p referred to as the slope of the gpp p was as follows fig 6 a c as predicted the gpp of the yrb increased with increases in p while the sensitivity of gpp to p decreased from the pre drought period to the recovery period with values of 0 43 0 37 and 0 13 cg m 2 mm 1 a 1 fig 6c respectively the sensitivity of gpp within the lpr was similar to the sensitivity of gpp to p with slopes of 0 39 0 32 and 0 16 cg m 2 mm 1 a 1 fig 6a respectively accordingly the sensitivity of gpp to p within the yrb was greater than that within the lpr during the three periods the response of gpp to tr referred to as the slope of the gpp tr was as follows fig 6b d gpp of the yrb and the lpr both increased with increases in p while the highest and lowest sensitivity occurred during the drought period and the recovery period respectively the slopes of gpp to tr of the yrb were 1 53 2 17 and 1 09 cg m 2 mm 1 a 1 from the pre drought period to the recovery period fig 6d respectively and corresponding values of the lpr were 1 77 1 90 and 1 45 cg m 2 mm 1 a 1 fig 6b respectively accordingly the sensitivity of gpp to tr within the yrb was greater than that within the lpr during drought periods 5 discussion 5 1 drought effects on the terrestrial ecosystem a long term meteorological drought event was detected from 1990 to 2001 in the yrb shown in fig 2 indeed decreasing p trends have been reported in many studies e g liu et al 2008b precipitation deficits which increase the occurrence of long term meteorological drought under climate change conditions will reduce soil water availability that in turn will result in longer and more severe intermittent drought stress with the potential to broadly alter both ecosystem structure and function stampfli et al 2018 vegetation response mechanisms to drought primarily rely on regulating their physiological processes i e photosynthesis respiration and transpiration to adapt to drought e g knauer et al 2017 for example plants can control stomatal closure to cope with drought a mechanism that can suppress tr and photosynthesis to restrain water loss and plant production liu et al 2018 in our study reversal in wue slope values from the pre drought period to the drought period fig 5e f and higher average wue table 2 confirm the response mechanism above under water deficit conditions the higher sensitivity of gpp to tr during the drought period fig 6b d explained the anomaly of wue levels of sensitivity of ecosystem function of water loss and carbon uptake to water deficit varies in changeable hydro climatic and geological condition we observed difference in wue response to long term drought between arid semi arid regions i e lpr and the other regions yrb investigated while most arid and semiarid regions in our study were within the lpr in addition wue exhibited an increasing trend at a value of 0 0032 cg m 2 mm 1 a 2 in the lpr and a decreasing trend at a value of 0 0020 cg m 2 mm 1 a 2 in the yrb throughout the drought period fig 5e f consistent with xu et al 2019 this finding is consistent with a previous study by yang et al 2016 and given that furthermore this finding was confirmed by the higher average trend fig 4 and average values table 2 of wue our study also noted that varied hydrological condition e g soil water storage runoff and groundwater recharge may impact sensitivity of carbon uptake process to drought and loess plateau revegetation caused increased runoff groundwater recharge and increased soil water storage furtherly resulting in the lack of rainwater for plant production and the decreasing sensitivity of gpp to p from the pre drought period to the recovery period fig 6a c confirm the finding above the revegetation activities e g grain for green have caused a 25 increase in vegetation cover feng et al 2016 we concluded that revegetation activities have inevitably altered terrestrial carbon uptake and evapotranspiration processes resulting in the complex response to drought in this region consistent with previous studies e g bai et al 2019 gao et al 2017 cao et al 2020 5 2 uncertainty of revegetation effects under climate change global climate change is projected to increase the frequency and intensity of drought as well as to amplify the effect of drought under increasing temperatures which is referred to as global change type drought allen and breshears 1998 breshears et al 2005 easterling 2000 global warming will lead to warmer meteorological drought conditions i e precipitation and aggravate hydrological drought i e streamflow and baseflow in the form of reduced water storage capacities under this background the restoration of vegetation on the loess plateau has been projected to overpass conditions of vegetation cover equilibrium that will subsequently result in the following negative ecological and hydrological consequences i decreasing runoff and its associated components i e baseflow through the alteration of precipitation distribution between evapotranspiration and runoff on a large scale li et al 2016 zhang et al 2008 ii severely decreasing water storage capacities throughout the whole yrb primarily within the middle and lower reaches li et al 2020 iii expanding dry soil layer induced by a soil moisture deficit especially in the northwestern region wang et al 2010 in recent years the expansion of the dry soil layer has exhibited an increasing trend e g wang and chen 2014 whose spatial distribution was observed to have obvious regional differentiation in both changeable water levels and land use types furthermore the deterioration of the dry soil layer has resulted in stunted or small old trees mcvicar et al 2008 shao et al 2016 and reduced the proportion of precipitation converted to groundwater and interfered with the process and the path of water cycles li 2001 notably global change type drought may cause plants to decrease and even result in their mortality at larger scales given that climate warming also contributes to the production of fresh dry soil layers and degrades existing dry soil layers by limiting the transfer of soil water and increasing soil evaporation however other studies have indicated that revegetation does not reduce surface water yields or catchment water storage as revegetation accelerates local moisture recycling processes and increases precipitable water on the loess plateau e g li et al 2018 gao et al 2017 confirming the positive role that revegetation plays on local water conservation in this region gao et al 2014 ultimately global warming will induce longer and more severe intermittent drought stress but revegetation will increase the uncertainty of its ecohydrological consequences given that plants play a major role in adjusting soil water storage and streamflow disturbances related to the revegetation and expansion of the dry soil layer to water cycles and available energy will complicate the response of streamflow and baseflow to drought consequently a comprehensive understanding of ecosystem response to drought will not only provide essential scientific guidance for relevant government agencies and stakeholders in dealing with future drought events e g vegetation management but will also offer invaluable lessons for other catchment regions that may potentially face similar warming induced meteorological drought 6 conclusions combined with anthropogenic activities e g revegetation drought effects on terrestrial ecosystems have resulted in complex hydrological and ecological consequences in this study we explored the response of terrestrial carbon uptake i e gpp transpiration tr and water use efficiency wue to a prolonged drought event and whose difference between hydrological response stages i e pre drought drought and recovery periods in the yellow river basin yrb a temperate water limited basin in china our findings can be summarized as follows i total gpp tr and wue exhibited an overall increasing trend with large inter annual fluctuations however the spatial distributions of temporal gpp tr and wue trends were uneven due to differences in vegetation type and coverage as well as the hydro climatic conditions of the sites investigated ii the yrb experienced an obvious long term meteorological drought event between 1990 and 2001 during this long term meteorological drought event plants exhibited improvement of gpp and tr and variation of wue variation reflecting the adjustment strategy in water utilization which contributed to the reversal of temporal trends between the yrb and the loess plateau region lpr differences in wue trends during the drought period confirmed the difference of sensitivities in ecosystem processes to changes in hydro climatic conditions iii generally gpp increased with an increase in p and tr while the sensitivity of gpp to changes in p and tr varied under hydrological response stages changes to carbon uptake and water loss that varied under the different water statuses controlled wue during the pre drought drought and recovery periods furthermore drought events in combination with revegetation initiatives have resulted in the complexity observed in the ecohydrological response of the loess plateau china in this context understanding how drought affects terrestrial ecosystems will help us better mitigate changes caused by climate change as well as protect and restore water limited basins declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements this study was supported by the

data monthly gpp and tr estimates throughout 1982 2010 at a 0 5 spatial resolution were obtained from six ecosystem models in the multi scale synthesis and terrestrial model intercomparison project mstmip https nacp ornl gov mstmip shtml huntzinger et al 2013 including the biome bgc model running and hunt 1993 white et al 2000 the triplex model peng et al 2002 the dynamic land ecosystem model dlem tian et al 2010 the integrated science assessment model isam jain and yang 2005 the combined community land model clm 4 0 and the variable infiltration capacity vic model clm vic lawrence et al 2011 oleson et al 2010 as well as the canadian land surface scheme class verseghy 1991 verseghy et al 1993 the model simulations all follow the similar experimental design and more importantly are all driven with the same set of climate drivers while simulated outputs are not direct observations of carbon and water cycle they integrated our current understanding of carbon and water exchanges between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere zscheischler et al 2014 we integrated monthly gpp and tr data to annual scale and then improved data reliability by averaging the annual datasets from all six models this study used climate research unit cru gridded monthly p data at a 0 5 spatial resolution from 1961 to 2017 provided by the university of east anglia https lr1 uea ac uk cru data corresponding to the input of the model simulations monthly p data were integrated to obtain annual p and to identify long term meteorological drought 3 method 3 1 quantifying drought many indices have been proposed to monitor drought over the past several decades mishra et al 2010 however most of these indices were developed for specific aspects of drought bringing difficulties in the comparison between different drought types for example the palmer drought severity index pdsi was developed to quantify agricultural drought by focusing on soil moisture palmer 1965 the standardized precipitation index spi has been applied to quantify hydrological drought mckee et al 1993 and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 was proposed to quantify multi scalar hydrological drought additionally spi usually adopt different probability distribution functions to fit the data which may result in additional uncertainties the pdsi has the strong influence of calibration period while it carries limited utility in areas other than that used for calibration problems in spatial comparability and subjectivity in relating drought conditions to the values of the index alley 1984 soulé 1992 akinremi et al 1996 some recent studies have found that long term stable drought events have a significant effect on ecosystems globally stuart haëntjens et al 2018 yan et al 2020 p anomalies a relative value respective to the mean yang et al 2014 can directly reflect the meteorological drought caused by abnormal precipitation many studies had examined the applicability of precipitation anomaly in china e g tian et al 2015 han et al 2009 according to yang 2017 this method is more suitable for long term meteorological drought here we defined meteorological drought via p anomaly percentage first we calculated the annual p anomaly percentage eq 1 and then smoothed it using a 3 year moving window to avoid single wetter years that could potentially cause a break in long term drought sequences saft et al 2015 in this study long term meteorological drought was defined as a period with greater than seven consecutive years of smoothed negative anomalies concrete detail was shown in fig 2 1 i p a p p p 100 where ipa is the percentage precipitation anomaly p is annual precipitation mm a 1 p is annual average annual precipitation mm a 1 3 2 determining temporal trends using a linear fitted model the ordinary least square regression olsr method has been widely used to analyze temporal trends in hydrometeorological variables this regression method logically provides specific data point weighting such as precipitation and streamflow e g hughes and crawford 2012 liu et al 2008a yang and zhou 2014 which can be shown as follows 2 a x y 1 n x y x 2 1 n x 2 3 b y a x we employed this method in our study to explore temporal gpp tr and wue trends during three different periods which was tested at a 95 confidence

annual gpp wue and tr increased in the whole yrb from 1982 to 2010 at change rate of 1 03 cg m 2 a 2 0 4 mm a 2 and 0 0018 cg m 2 mm 1 a 1 respectively ii temporal gpp tr and wue trends were unevenly distributed moreover grid cells exhibiting increasing gpp tr and wue accounted for 73 77 49 23 and 78 33 of the whole yrb respectively while areas exhibiting increasing gpp or tr were located in west and east and decreasing wue mostly in the southern yrb iii regions exhibiting significant increasing gpp tr and wue trends p 0 05 accounted for 25 93 11 46 and 27 24 of the whole yrb with an average rate of 1 52 cg m 2 a 2 1 06 mm a 2 and 0 0078 cg m 2 mm 1 a 1 respectively finally iv regions exhibiting significant increasing gpp and tr trends p 0 05 followed similar abovementioned uneven distribution pattern notably temporal gpp and tr trends in the central region of the yrb were within the confines of the lpr moreover their decreasing trends of gpp and tr in the lpr were obvious and much more pronounced while significant increasing wue trends p 0 05 mainly derived from the central lpr fig 3 table 1 at the same time annual gpp and tr in the lpr exhibited increasing trends at a lower rate of 0 53 cg m 2 a 2 and 0 05 mm a 2 respectively while annual wue exhibited higher increasing trends at a rate of 0 0033 cg m 2 mm 1 a 1 compared to corresponding temporal trends for the whole yrb table 1 fig 4 4 2 ecological response to long term drought annual p anomalies were used to detect the long term drought event which commenced in 1990 and concluded in 2001 fig 2 the duration of the long term drought event was 12 years according to the long term drought event the whole 29 year study period was subdivided into three distinct periods a pre drought period 1982 1989 a drought period 1990 2001 and a recovery period 2002 2010 fig 5 simple liner regression model was applied to trend analysis of gpp tr and wue in the three periods temporal gpp tr and wue trends during the pre drought drought and recovery periods in the yrb showed that fig 5 gpp first decreased and then increased with slopes of 0 20 1 28 and 3 77 cg m 2 a 2 respectively illustrating that slope rates progressively increased from the drought period to recovery period for which a turning point occurred in 1990 fig 5b tr showed similar trends to gpp during all the three periods with slopes of 1 10 0 86 and 2 14 mm a 2 fig 5d respectively wue showed reverse trends first increasing and then decreasing throughout the three periods with slopes of 0 0047 0 0020 and 0 0056 cg m 2 mm 1 a 2 fig 5f respectively temporal gpp tr and wue trends for the pre drought drought and recovery periods in the lpr showed that fig 5 the gpp trend continuously increased at rates of 0 14 1 89 and 3 69 cg m 2 a 2 throughout the three periods fig 5a respectively tr also first decreased and then increased with slopes of 0 06 0 75 and 3 23 mm a 2 fig 5c respectively wue exhibited greater fluctuation first decreasing then increasing and finally decreasing once again with slopes of 9 74e 4 0 0032 and 0 01 cg m 2 mm 1 a 2 fig 5e respectively temporal gpp tr and wue trends reversed in 1990 in both the yrb and lpr except for gpp in the lpr and more significant gpp trends and wue trend were observed during the drought period in lpr fig 5 during the drought period wue exhibited the reverse trend between the yrb and the lpr table 2 provides the average gpp tr and wue values and results of significance of difference test for all the three periods i average p and tr yielded the lowest values during the drought period while average gpp and wue continuously increased from the pre drought period to recovery period in the yrb ii average gpp p and tr all yielded the lowest values during the drought period while wue yielded the highest value during the recovery period in the lpr iii all averaged value of yrb variables were greater than corresponding lpr variables except for wue iv differences of gpp p tr and wue between the three periods are all insignificant whose p value 0 05 except tr in yrb 4 3 gpp response to p and tr according to results of simple liner regression the response of gpp to p referred to as the slope of the gpp p was as follows fig 6 a c as predicted the gpp of the yrb increased with increases in p while the sensitivity of gpp to p decreased from the pre drought period to the recovery period with values of 0 43 0 37 and 0 13 cg m 2 mm 1 a 1 fig 6c respectively the sensitivity of gpp within the lpr was similar to the sensitivity of gpp to p with slopes of 0 39 0 32 and 0 16 cg m 2 mm 1 a 1 fig 6a respectively accordingly the sensitivity of gpp to p within the yrb was greater than that within the lpr during the three periods the response of gpp to tr referred to as the slope of the gpp tr was as follows fig 6b d gpp of the yrb and the lpr both increased with increases in p while the highest and lowest sensitivity occurred during the drought period and the recovery period respectively the slopes of gpp to tr of the yrb were 1 53 2 17 and 1 09 cg m 2 mm 1 a 1 from the pre drought period to the recovery period fig 6d respectively and corresponding values of the lpr were 1 77 1 90 and 1 45 cg m 2 mm 1 a 1 fig 6b respectively accordingly the sensitivity of gpp to tr within the yrb was greater than that within the lpr during drought periods 5 discussion 5 1 drought effects on the terrestrial ecosystem a long term meteorological drought event was detected from 1990 to 2001 in the yrb shown in fig 2 indeed decreasing p trends have been reported in many studies e g liu et al 2008b precipitation deficits which increase the occurrence of long term meteorological drought under climate change conditions will reduce soil water availability that in turn will result in longer and more severe intermittent drought stress with the potential to broadly alter both ecosystem structure and function stampfli et al 2018 vegetation response mechanisms to drought primarily rely on regulating their physiological processes i e photosynthesis respiration and transpiration to adapt to drought e g knauer et al 2017 for example plants can control stomatal closure to cope with drought a mechanism that can suppress tr and photosynthesis to restrain water loss and plant production liu et al 2018 in our study reversal in wue slope values from the pre drought period to the drought period fig 5e f and higher average wue table 2 confirm the response mechanism above under water deficit conditions the higher sensitivity of gpp to tr during the drought period fig 6b d explained the anomaly of wue levels of sensitivity of ecosystem function of water loss and carbon uptake to water deficit varies in changeable hydro climatic and geological condition we observed difference in wue response to long term drought between arid semi arid regions i e lpr and the other regions yrb investigated while most arid and semiarid regions in our study were within the lpr in addition wue exhibited an increasing trend at a value of 0 0032 cg m 2 mm 1 a 2 in the lpr and a decreasing trend at a value of 0 0020 cg m 2 mm 1 a 2 in the yrb throughout the drought period fig 5e f consistent with xu et al 2019 this finding is consistent with a previous study by yang et al 2016 and given that furthermore this finding was confirmed by the higher average trend fig 4 and average values table 2 of wue our study also noted that varied hydrological condition e g soil water storage runoff and groundwater recharge may impact sensitivity of carbon uptake process to drought and loess plateau revegetation caused increased runoff groundwater recharge and increased soil water storage furtherly resulting in the lack of rainwater for plant production and the decreasing sensitivity of gpp to p from the pre drought period to the recovery period fig 6a c confirm the finding above the revegetation activities e g grain for green have caused a 25 increase in vegetation cover feng et al 2016 we concluded that revegetation activities have inevitably altered terrestrial carbon uptake and evapotranspiration processes resulting in the complex response to drought in this region consistent with previous studies e g bai et al 2019 gao et al 2017 cao et al 2020 5 2 uncertainty of revegetation effects under climate change global climate change is projected to increase the frequency and intensity of drought as well as to amplify the effect of drought under increasing temperatures which is referred to as global change type drought allen and breshears 1998 breshears et al 2005 easterling 2000 global warming will lead to warmer meteorological drought conditions i e precipitation and aggravate hydrological drought i e streamflow and baseflow in the form of reduced water storage capacities under this background the restoration of vegetation on the loess plateau has been projected to overpass conditions of vegetation cover equilibrium that will subsequently result in the following negative ecological and hydrological consequences i decreasing runoff and its associated components i e baseflow through the alteration of precipitation distribution between evapotranspiration and runoff on a large scale li et al 2016 zhang et al 2008 ii severely decreasing water storage capacities throughout the whole yrb primarily within the middle and lower reaches li et al 2020 iii expanding dry soil layer induced by a soil moisture deficit especially in the northwestern region wang et al 2010 in recent years the expansion of the dry soil layer has exhibited an increasing trend e g wang and chen 2014 whose spatial distribution was observed to have obvious regional differentiation in both changeable water levels and land use types furthermore the deterioration of the dry soil layer has resulted in stunted or small old trees mcvicar et al 2008 shao et al 2016 and reduced the proportion of precipitation converted to groundwater and interfered with the process and the path of water cycles li 2001 notably global change type drought may cause plants to decrease and even result in their mortality at larger scales given that climate warming also contributes to the production of fresh dry soil layers and degrades existing dry soil layers by limiting the transfer of soil water and increasing soil evaporation however other studies have indicated that revegetation does not reduce surface water yields or catchment water storage as revegetation accelerates local moisture recycling processes and increases precipitable water on the loess plateau e g li et al 2018 gao et al 2017 confirming the positive role that revegetation plays on local water conservation in this region gao et al 2014 ultimately global warming will induce longer and more severe intermittent drought stress but revegetation will increase the uncertainty of its ecohydrological consequences given that plants play a major role in adjusting soil water storage and streamflow disturbances related to the revegetation and expansion of the dry soil layer to water cycles and available energy will complicate the response of streamflow and baseflow to drought consequently a comprehensive understanding of ecosystem response to drought will not only provide essential scientific guidance for relevant government agencies and stakeholders in dealing with future drought events e g vegetation management but will also offer invaluable lessons for other catchment regions that may potentially face similar warming induced meteorological drought 6 conclusions combined with anthropogenic activities e g revegetation drought effects on terrestrial ecosystems have resulted in complex hydrological and ecological consequences in this study we explored the response of terrestrial carbon uptake i e gpp transpiration tr and water use efficiency wue to a prolonged drought event and whose difference between hydrological response stages i e pre drought drought and recovery periods in the yellow river basin yrb a temperate water limited basin in china our findings can be summarized as follows i total gpp tr and wue exhibited an overall increasing trend with large inter annual fluctuations however the spatial distributions of temporal gpp tr and wue trends were uneven due to differences in vegetation type and coverage as well as the hydro climatic conditions of the sites investigated ii the yrb experienced an obvious long term meteorological drought event between 1990 and 2001 during this long term meteorological drought event plants exhibited improvement of gpp and tr and variation of wue variation reflecting the adjustment strategy in water utilization which contributed to the reversal of temporal trends between the yrb and the loess plateau region lpr differences in wue trends during the drought period confirmed the difference of sensitivities in ecosystem processes to changes in hydro climatic conditions iii generally gpp increased with an increase in p and tr while the sensitivity of gpp to changes in p and tr varied under hydrological response stages changes to carbon uptake and water loss that varied under the different water statuses controlled wue during the pre drought drought and recovery periods furthermore drought events in combination with revegetation initiatives have resulted in the complexity observed in the ecohydrological response of the loess plateau china in this context understanding how drought affects terrestrial ecosystems will help us better mitigate changes caused by climate change as well as protect and restore water limited basins declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements this study was supported by the

8206,study region wales united kingdom study focus climate change is predicted to have a large impact on the hydrological regimes of welsh rivers however its influence on the abstraction capability of key sectors such as public water supply pws and hydroelectric power hep is not yet fully understood we use the soil and water assessment tool swat to generate future 2021 2079 streamflows under a worst case scenario of greenhouse gas emissions representative concentration pathway 8 5 at two catchments in wales the conwy and tywi swat streamflow output is used to estimate total unmet demand for pws and changes in generation characteristics for hep pws unmet demand is assessed using the water evaluation and planning weap system under increasing static and declining demand scenarios mann kendall analysis is performed to detect and characterise trends new hydrological insights for the region under all future demand scenarios there is increased occurrence of insufficient streamflow to satisfy pws demand for hep decrease in annual abstraction volume results in a loss of generation potential despite an increasing number of days that maximum abstraction is reached changes in hep generation and pws availability are most pronounced in the medium term 2021 2054 with rate of change slowing after 2060 we provide a novel perspective on future water resource availability in wales giving context to management planning to ensure future pws sustainability and hep generation efficiency keywords hydroelectric power hydroclimatic change hydrological modelling trend analysis water resource management water supply demand balance 1 introduction climate change is a key driver of hydrological regime alteration globally with prevailing weather conditions being inextricably linked with streamflow given the dependence of society on river systems for everyday life it is of great importance to understand how climate change will impact water resource availability in the uk it is widely accepted that climate change will lead to hotter drier summers and warmer wetter winters as well as an increase in the magnitude frequency and duration of extreme weather events asc 2016a lowe et al 2018 in terms of streamflow an exacerbation of low and high flows is expected as well as a reduction in average summer and autumn flows and an increase in winter and spring average flows these opposing trends should leave annual averages relatively stable christierson et al 2012 kay et al 2020 prudhomme et al 2012 watts et al 2015 climate change and streamflow responses in wales specifically are projected to be in line with the trends suggested for the rest of the uk with summer mean and maximum temperatures as well as winter total and extreme precipitation volumes predicted to increase asc 2016b kay et al 2020 these changes have the potential to cause a large impact on major water consuming sectors such as agriculture heavy industries public water supply pws and hydroelectric power hep generation the adaptation sub committee asc of the committee on climate change for example suggests that pws and agricultural water demand for irrigation could be two of the most pressurised sectors in the uk under future climate and streamflow changes with demand potentially outstripping available water resources asc 2016a furthermore arnell and delaney 2006 detailed how even at that time of publication pws companies in england and wales would need to adapt to ensure sufficient raw water resources due to changes to low flow regimes in wales carless and whitehead 2013 demonstrate decreasing summer and autumn streamflows with corresponding increases in winter and spring in the given context of a theoretical 99 kw micro hep installation this causes an accentuation of seasonality in terms of energy generation with extra supply in wetter seasons compensating for lower supply in drier seasons leading to an annually stable situation carless and whitehead 2013 however these changes are likely to be catchment specific depending on the individual catchment s topographic and land cover characteristics as well as the prevailing weather patterns in 2018 renewable energy accounted for 25 of the total electricity generated in wales with hep making up 5 2 of this and therefore 1 3 of overall welsh electricity generation welsh government 2019 a large increase in the number of small scale hep schemes has occurred in the last eight years due to financial incentives in the form of feed in tariffs fit welsh government 2019 and also given that most opportunities for large scale schemes have been exhausted carless and whitehead 2013 however due to the curtailment of the fit scheme in 2019 the number of new developments has slowed with further schemes only likely to be commissioned where conditions are optimal welsh government 2019 these types of schemes usually run of river in design generally have little or no water impoundment making them particularly vulnerable to changes in hydrological conditions run of river hep schemes are usually designed and optimised on the basis of historical flow with flow duration curves used to set abstraction conditions while this method is a good starting point for designing the most efficient system to maximise power output it neglects to account for future streamflows climate change has the potential to cause major alteration to the hydrological characteristics of river systems modifying the timing and quantity of available water high and low flows are particularly likely to be affected asc 2016b kay et al 2020 sayers et al 2015 watts et al 2015 and these extreme flows are often important in terms of hep scheme design in 2017 the welsh government set a target for 70 of electricity consumed in wales to be generated by renewables by 2030 welsh government 2019 hep plays a small but important role in reaching this target especially in the winter and spring seasons when electricity generation from other sources such as solar pv is lower therefore understanding the nature of change in the abstractable flow for hep schemes under future climate change is crucial this will allow for more robust planning of the future energy mix in wales as well as maximisation of resource use efficiency and electricity generation pws also relies heavily on surface waters in wales with over 95 of the supplied water originating from rivers and lakes dcww 2019a in wales pws is largely under the authority of dŵr cymru welsh water dcww who provide an average of 800 million litres of water per day to over three million people dcww 2019b while the majority of surface water used is from lakes and reservoirs a substantial proportion is taken from lowland river abstractions especially for rivers in south wales such as the wye usk and tywi which are often supported by upstream reservoirs in times of very low flow dcww 2019b while the water supply system in wales is largely resilient to climate change due to the amount of water stored changes in climate still do have the ability to change the required water management and places greater pressure on the system asc 2016b the asc report a 12 supply demand surplus for pws in wales however this is set to decline under projected population growth and climate change with three of dcww s water resource zones expected to be in deficit by the 2080s asc 2016b dcww 2019a projected increases in the occurrence of low flows will impact how often pws and hep operators are permitted to abstract water from rivers in the future with stringent hands off flow hof regulations applied to abstractions to ensure the protection of low flows downstream in addition a greater occurrence of large flow events will potentially be of little use to abstractors to compensate for less abstraction potential due to low flows if system capabilities such as turbine size for hep do not allow for it it is therefore important to study these future changes now to successfully plan for systems that are resilient to climate change and make the most of available future flows in this paper we study the impact of climate change on two catchments in wales the conwy and tywi especially in terms of future water availability for small scale hep generation and pws this is a less studied region of the uk in this regard due to the perceived abundance of water resources in wales however owing to both the reliance on surface waters for pws and the large recent increase in small scale hep projects this is an important area in which to understand future water resource changes 2 data and methods 2 1 study catchments our two study catchments conwy and tywi fig 1 were selected due to their contrasting physical characteristics especially in terms of catchment land use land cover lulc mean catchment slope and catchment area table 1 all potentially giving rise to differences in hydrological regime these catchments are also exploited for their water resources in the form of hep and pws with natural resources wales nrw providing abstraction licenses for non impoundment run of river hep schemes in both the conwy and tywi nrw 2019 both catchments are also used for pws however only the tywi catchment has an abstraction taken directly from the river with pws in conwy sourced from reservoirs only dcww 2019b the downstream river based abstraction in tywi is supported in times of low flow by upstream releases from the llyn brianne reservoir dcww 2019a this abstraction supplies the largest drinking water treatment plant in dcww s network serving a population of 400 000 in swansea neath bridgend and the vale of glamorgan dcww 2019b making the abstraction an important location to study in terms of future water supply demand balance the conwy catchment is more mountainous in topography with a steeper mean slope and greater maximum elevation peaking 261 m higher than the tywi at 1062 m near the summit of snowdon the tywi catchment however has more than double the drainage area of conwy at 1365 km2 to conwy s 542 km2 table 1 the catchments are also contrasting in terms of lulc fig 1 with the tywi being dominated by agriculture pasture specifically 63 9 which is well distributed throughout all but the highest elevations in the catchment the conwy catchment on the other hand has a larger proportion of scrubland 42 1 in particular moors heathland 23 6 and natural grassland 16 6 mostly to the west of the main channel with the eastern side being more pasture dominated fig 1 the conwy also features a large peat bog in the south of the catchment accounting for 8 4 of total catchment lulc this is significantly more than is seen in the tywi table 1 forests cover a slightly larger area of the tywi 16 0 than the conwy 13 7 but the mix of forestry types is different with notably more coniferous forest in the tywi 10 1 while the conwy has equal proportions of coniferous and mixed forest 5 5 table 1 2 2 future streamflow and climate projections future streamflows for both catchments were modelled at a daily resolution for the hydrological years 2021 2079 using the physically based semi distributed continuous time step soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model arnold et al 2012 1998 neitsch et al 2011 swat has been used extensively in the context of future hydrological regime change and water resources assessment globally coffey et al 2016 khan et al 2020 perra et al 2018 sultana and choi 2018 yuan et al 2019 with publications focussing on both hep abera et al 2018 haguma et al 2017 park and kim 2014 shrestha et al 2016 and water availability bessa santos et al 2019 rivas tabares et al 2019 sharma et al 2016 veettil and mishra 2016 initial input data for swat were obtained from ordnance survey 5 m resolution os terrain 5 dem ordnance survey 2020 the eu soil database version 2 0 specifically the soil geographical database of eurasia a 1 1 000 000 scale vector dataset european commission 2004 and the corine land cover dataset copernicus land monitoring data eea 2012 the os terrain 5 dem is a high resolution raster dataset with a 5 metre post spacing ordnance survey 2017 and was chosen in order to provide the most accurate catchment delineation and water routing possible as well as to maintain computational efficiency for the size of catchments studied in terms of lulc the corine dataset was chosen due to the close match of lulc categories between it and the pre exiting swat lulc categories allowing for easy input to and interpretation by the model the corine dataset is accurate spatially to within 25 m with a minimum mapping unit of 25 ha for areal features and width of 100 m for linear features the accuracy of identified lulc type is greater than 85 eea 2017 the calculation of swat soil parameters was completed using the pedo transfer function developed by saxton and rawls 2006 based on the characteristics associated with the given world reference base for soil resources fao 1998 classification of each soil type additionally historical daily weather data air temperature and precipitation and streamflow data both used for model calibration and validation was sourced from the centre for ecology and hydrology s ceh climate hydrology and ecology research support system chess dataset robinson et al 2017 and the national river flow archive dataset nrfa 2020 respectively the gridded chess dataset was chosen due to its complete coverage across the catchments especially when compared to data from individual meteorological stations of which there are few with long complete and consistent records for the area chess precipitation data is based on the ceh 1 km gridded estimates of areal rainfall gear dataset which is an interpolated dataset based on meteorological station rainfall observations adjusted for topography to provide full uk coverage keller et al 2015 temperature data for chess is downscaled to a 1 km grid also taking account of topographical data from the 0 5 degree gridded climate research unit time series version 3 21 dataset cru ts3 21 which is also based on meteorological station observations harris et al 2014 in order to provide a single dataset of each climatic variable for each catchment the mean value of all grid cells contained with a catchment was calculated for each day of the study period it is this value after inspection for anomalies that has been used streamflow data was taken from gauges with as close to natural flow as possible station 66011 for conwy and 60006 for tywi the catchments were calibrated individually with the historical streamflow data for a 14 year period of 1985 1998 following a 3 year model warm up period we used the particle swarm optimisation pso method kennedy and eberhart 1995 for model calibration through the swat calibration and uncertainty programme swat cup with the kling gupta efficiency kge as the goodness of fit metric gupta et al 2009 pso is a complex but highly efficient method of calibration capitalising on swarm intelligence to iteratively improve the model performance by finding the optimal parameter values within a given range search space taking inspiration from flocking birds kennedy and eberhart 1995 in practice this entails a swarm of particles being initialised with each particle in the swarm randomly assigned a position and velocity the initial locations are evaluated for model fit and these automatically become each particles current best solution the group s best solution is set at the value of the particle with the best fit of all particles the individual particles then iteratively work towards with a random function a combination of their own and the groups best known position qi et al 2015 the process stops once either a given kge value is reached or the number of swarm iterations is reached whichever is sooner this method of calibration was chosen due to the simultaneous multiple parameter calibration required which can be accomplished by pso as well as its computational efficiency which was important due to the number of parameters and size of the catchments studied a total of 17 parameters table 2 were calibrated simultaneously these were selected based on a literature review of studies operating in similar catchment types the calibration kge values after 10 iterations with 10 particles 100 model runs per catchment were deemed acceptable at 0 770 for conwy and 0 841 for tywi a comparison of the observed and simulated streamflow for the calibration period is shown in fig 2 following implementation of the calibrated parameters values into swat we validated the model for the 1999 2014 period once again with a 3 year model warm up and obtained the kge values of 0 718 for conwy and 0 717 for tywi future streamflows were projected based on the weather input derived from the uk climate projections 2018 dataset regional projections on a 12 km grid over the uk for 1980 2080 mohc 2018 the most recent projections available for the uk these projections allow for the use of an ensemble of twelve regional climate models downscaled from the 60 km hadgem3 gc3 05 global coupled model for more information on these projections we direct the reader to murphy et al 2018 this projected future climate input is based on a worst case scenario of future global greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the form of representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp8 5 from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc rcp8 5 represents one of the worst emissions outcomes of a no policy scenario with high population growth continued coal use and no downturn in global ghg emissions riahi et al 2011 van vuuren et al 2011 leading to a scenario of radiative forcing still rising by 2100 and not peaking until the 2200s moss et al 2010 van vuuren et al 2011 this is an extreme future scenario in the 90th percentile of future modelled outcomes of no climate change mitigation van vuuren et al 2011 and has been used in this research despite the higher levels of uncertainty associated with it due to the critical nature of the study subject in particular pws to ensure an uninterrupted future pws it is vital to take account of such a scenario to allow for robust planning in addition in a future society where renewable energy is likely to make up a larger part of the overall energy mix understanding the potential fluctuation in hep generation caused by alteration in streamflows under climate change is highly important a summary of future temperature precipitation and streamflow is shown in fig 3 the data shown for all three factors is based on the average of all twelve downscaled regional climate model ensemble members temperatures are projected to increase in all seasons while precipitation and streamflow both increase in the winter and spring but decrease in the summer and autumn leading to a small overall annual reduction 2 3 hydroelectric power assessment assessment of changes in the abstraction regime for hep locations was undertaken for non impoundment run of river based schemes only of which there are a total of sixteen in conwy and nine in tywi abstraction locations were obtained from nrw due to lack of specific information pertaining to each hep scheme such as abstraction licence conditions scheme layout generation capacity etc abstraction conditions were based on general licensing guidelines laid out by nrw nrw 2020 guidance from the organisation states that for schemes creating a depleted reach i e run of river schemes and that do not operate on rivers supporting salmon spawning or protected species there are two types of abstraction permitted zone 2 z2 and zone 3 z3 nrw 2020 it was assumed for the purposes of this study that all schemes operate under z2 or z3 a summary of the conditions placed on abstraction rates of these zones is made in table 3 schemes are categorised into either zone based on the gradient of the depleted reach with those below 10 gradient being z2 and those above being z3 as information on the actual depleted reach was not available the average slope of the sub basin immediately downstream of the abstraction location was taken and the corresponding zone type applied fig 4 under the assumption that each hep site abstracts the maximum amount of flow available to it and given daily average streamflow q eqs 1 and 2 were used to calculate daily average abstraction volume a d a i l y at each location in line with abstraction rates dependent on the site zone 1 q s u r p l u s q h o f where h o f represents the compensation hands off flow release required to protect low flows and q s u r p l u s is the amount of water available for abstraction used to calculate a d a i l y 2 a d a i l y q s u r p l u s q t a k e 0 a m a x a d a i l y i f a d a i l y a s t a r t i f a d a i l y a m a x i f a s t a r t a d a i l y a m a x where q t a k e is the proportion of flow available for abstraction as per the zone conditions a s t a r t refers to the minimum abstraction volume required to start and for efficient operation of the turbine and a m a x represents the maximum permitted abstraction volume a further assumption was that an impulse turbine is in use at each site as is common with small scale hep schemes in upper catchment reaches such as those analysed in this study cobb and sharp 2013 lilienthal et al 2004 židonis et al 2015 impulse turbines have largely high and stable efficiency after approximately 10 of designed flow is achieved chitrakar et al 2020 novara and mcnabola 2018 paish 2002 making them ideal for settings with variable adaily cobb and sharp 2013 for this reason astart was set at 10 of amax for each scheme which is the assumed design flow volume 2 4 public water supply assessment an assessment of the impact of future hydrological regime change on pws was undertaken in the tywi catchment only due to the lack of river based pws abstraction in the conwy catchment the supply demand balance at the aforementioned single major abstraction location fig 4 was calculated using the water evaluation and planning weap system raskin et al 1992 yates et al 2005 weap is an integrated water resource management model that assimilates the demand and infrastructure management with physical hydrological processes and allows for multiple scenario analysis and comparison raskin et al 1992 yates et al 2005 the weap model has been used extensively for scenario analysis related to water resource planning and allocation in a variety of contexts such as the impacts of climate and land use change ashofteh et al 2013 esteve et al 2015 joyce et al 2011 purkey et al 2008 tena et al 2019 reservoir and dam operation planning azari et al 2018 demertzi et al 2014 mccartney and menker girma 2012 vonk et al 2014 ecosystem requirements and environmental protection thompson et al 2012 fatemi et al 2013 flores lópez et al 2016 momblanch et al 2020 and population increase and urbanisation impacts alamanos et al 2020 höllermann et al 2010 kumar et al 2017 toure et al 2017 however weap is not designed for detailed optimisation studies such as that required for hep yates et al 2005 for this reason the model has only been used in the pws analysis for this study future total daily water demand was calculated for three scenarios fig 5 representing increased static and declining abstraction requirement the increased demand scenario was based on the linear relationship between historical daily temperature and total water abstraction from the location as presented by dallison et al 2020 the water abstraction data was provided by dcww for january 2012 to december 2016 period the static demand scenario was based on the same 2012 2016 data with a mean for each day being taken across the 5 year dataset this year of mean values was then applied every year for the future period the decreased demand scenario used the same starting base as the static scenario with demand decreasing linearly by 20 across the period this decrease is in line with that projected in dcww s latest water resource management plan dcww 2019b based on an extensive leakage reduction programme and decreasing domestic water usage despite a projected increase in the population served a compensatory hof was also implemented in weap set at 681 91 million litres per day as laid out in the abstraction license for this location swwra 1965 total daily unmet demand d u n m e t was then calculated under each scenario using eq 3 3 d u n m e t q h o f d where d is daily total water demand q and h o f are defined as eq 1 due to the aforementioned system of reservoir low flow support by llyn brianne dunmet is therefore also assumed to be equal to the total daily required reservoir release 2 5 trend analysis trends in the output data from the hep and pws calculations were analysed using the mann kendall mk trend analysis kendall 1975 mann 1945 in line with other studies that have analysed data relating to hydrological regime change dallison et al 2020 jin et al 2020 mudbhatkal and amai 2018 murphy et al 2013 mwangi et al 2016 zaman et al 2016 2015 the non parametric test was deemed suitable due to the nature of hydrological data which is non normally distributed and exhibits seasonality the hamed rao method of auto correlation correction hamed and rao 1998 was applied along with sen s slope estimator sen 1968 to evaluate the direction and size of detected trends trends for all factors were analysed based on seasonal winter december to february spring march to may summer june to august autumn september to november and annual averages hydrological years or totals dependent on the factor hep trends for each catchment were analysed separately for the average of all z2 and all z3 abstractions the factors analysed were 1 number of days where adaily is greater than astart i e number of days generation is possible 2 number of days amax reached 3 mean adaily on days generation possible and 4 total seasonal annual abstraction for pws total unmet demand number of days demand unmet and mean unmet demand were all analysed under each demand scenario for both hep and pws the mean of the output of all twelve downscaled regional climate model ensemble members was used and is presented in the results section the mean of the twelve model runs has been used so as to take account of uncertainty in the future climate projections and therefore the generated streamflow data in addition the mk analysis was applied to the full 2021 2079 long term period as well as to the end of a medium term period 2021 2054 this approach is useful for hep as the near future analysis is more in line with the life span of recently installed and soon to be installed small scale systems hatata et al 2019 killingtveit 2019 for pws the near future analysis is a similar period as is currently being planned for 2050 being the end of the planning period for recently published water resource management plans e g dcww 2019b for wales specifically dcww also recently published a vision document to 2050 dcww 2018 hep and pws baseline 2021 2030 near future 2045 2054 and far future 2070 2079 decadal averages were also taken seasonally and annually for the same factors as the mk analysis to enable further visualisation of a potential medium and long term planning needs for both industries 3 results 3 1 hydroelectric power with regards to change in the number of days annually when astart is achievable all abstraction locations display a decrease in both the medium term 2021 2054 and long term 2021 2079 although these trends are statistically significant for more hep abstractions in the medium term analysis than in the long term fig 6 trends in the number of days when amax is reached are more variable especially in the long term with differences seen both within and between the two catchments the conwy in this period for example exhibits statistically significant increases for all abstractions in the west of the catchment while those on the eastern side vary with a statistically significant decrease being present for one location fig 7 in the medium term there is more agreement between abstraction locations with all but one z3 abstraction in each catchment seeing an increase in the number of days when maximum abstraction is achieved the combination of these two broad trends fewer days of abstraction but larger abstraction volumes available causes mean adaily on days when abstraction is possible to increase for the vast majority of locations in both time periods but especially so in the medium term fig 8 however when observing the change in total volume abstracted per year a decrease is displayed in all locations for both time periods fig 9 notably in the medium term trends for total abstraction all z3 abstractions had statistically significant p 0 05 decreases in volume while all z2 locations decline without statistical significance fig 9 the only factor which showed such a split figs 10 and 11 provide more details on the seasonal trends observed in the four factors studied for long term and medium term respectively examining the trends taking place in the 2021 2079 period it can be seen that the most significant change generally occurs in the spring and autumn with small declines in annual total abstraction and number of days astart is achieved in the medium term a greater number of statistically significant trends are seen in winter and summer with increases in annual mean adaily also being statistically significant total abstraction also varies considerably between the two periods with significant increases seen across both catchments and abstraction zones in winter and spring and decreases in summer and autumn leading to an overall decrease annually at the z3 abstractions in the medium term analysis little difference can be seen between the corresponding trends for the two catchments with trend direction agreeing in all but three occasions and few occasions of varying magnitude of change in terms of difference between the two abstraction types once again little variation is seen however when studying the percentage change from the baseline 2021 2030 annual average with the near and far future decadal annual averages table 4 large differences in the number of days amax is reached are shown between the zones in the far future average the z3 abstractions display a 9 decline in tywi and stay stable in conwy nonetheless the z2 abstractions increase quite significantly in both catchments 32 and 18 respectively few differences are seen between the zones catchments or time periods for the other factors studied finally with the exception of total abstraction the magnitude of change from the baseline is greater for the near future than far future 3 2 public water supply under all three demand scenarios in both the medium and long term we observe an increase in the number of days annually when streamflow is not sufficient to satisfy demand as well as an increase in the mean and total unmet demand volume fig 12 these trends are larger in magnitude for the 2021 2054 period and are also statistically significant for this period p 0 05 with the exception of mean unmet demand in the decreased demand scenario fig 12 no unmet demand is recorded at any point in the winter months under any scenarios whereas kendall s tau results suggest a decrease in unmet demand in spring especially in the medium term analysis although this is not statistically significant autumn displays the most consistency in trends across both time periods and the three demand scenarios with large magnitudes of change seen in total unmet demand and number of days demand unmet further analysis table 5 reveals that for all factors considered and under all demand scenarios the degree of change between the annual averages of the baseline and near future is much greater than that between the baseline and far future for example under the increased demand scenario total unmet demand is 167 higher than the baseline in the near future whereas the far future period is only 84 higher similarly for the number of days demand is not met in the static demand scenario the near future average is 151 higher than the baseline at 42 4 days per year compared to only 30 7 day per year in the far future period a 77 increase on the baseline of 17 2 days table 5 the same is true for mean unmet demand in the decreased demand scenario with the near future period being 49 higher than the baseline and the far future being only 10 greater 4 discussion 4 1 hydroelectric power the results of the mk trend analysis conducted on hep abstraction characteristics display a range of changes with most variation seen between the seasons and time periods studied rather than between catchments or abstraction zones these patterns are driven by the streamflow changes shown in fig 3 an example of this are the declines seen in spring and summer flows in conwy and tywi up to the late 2050s followed by an increase in summer flows to the end of the study period for tywi and a plateau for conwy autumn flows plateau after this point for both catchments these seasonal streamflow changes lead to the differences in trends observed in the mk analysis with larger and more statistically significant results being seen in the medium term than long for declines in mean abstraction number of days astart achieved and number of days amax reached changes in these factors in summer in particular are only significant in the medium term analysis due to the levelling off conwy and increase tywi seen in streamflow after this period this observed shift towards less days and volume of abstraction in the summer and autumn and an increase in the winter and spring is in line with previously published research for wales and the uk to our knowledge the only previous study that has investigated climate change impacts on hydropower in wales specifically is the aforementioned work of carless and whitehead 2013 their research presents trends in streamflow and potential hep output for streams in the upper severn catchment similar in nature to the abstraction locations studied in the present research a baseline 2020 and 2050 scenarios are considered with a marked decline in flow and power output in summer and early autumn months displayed in 2050 carless and whitehead 2013 winter and early spring months show a smaller magnitude increase for the same period leading to a stable situation annually carless and whitehead 2013 these results align well with that of our study s medium term trend analysis for total abstraction while no further studies use wales as a region of focus specifically other research based on the uk or regions thereof seems to be consistent with our results scotland for example which is comparable to wales due to the similar nature of catchments and also due to the high uptake of hep in the country sample et al 2015 summarises the research on the potential impacts of climate change on scotland s hep it is suggested that run off which is highly sensitive to climate change is closely linked to generation potential this relationship in line with the results of this study is projected to cause a decline in summer generation potential although this is likely to be offset in the winter hep schemes may be unable to make use of the higher flows due to design limitations sample et al 2015 further work in scotland by thompson 2012 on the impacts of climate change on streamflow also lend weight to the findings of this research once again suggesting an accentuation of low summer flows and high winter flows in the future these trends are also echoed on a uk scale by research such as uk ceh 2012 and kay et al 2020 both corroborating the seasonal and annual driving streamflow trends observed in the study catchments of this research furthermore the trends observed of mean abstraction volume increasing while total abstraction volume is decreasing suggests that there will be fewer days of abstraction in the future but with greater abstraction per day this trend also fits with the observed decrease in the number of days astart is reached and the increases seen in the number of days amax is achieved once again this is particularly pronounced in the medium term analysis and is supported by research on low and high flows in wales collet et al 2018 marx et al 2018 thober et al 2018 and visser quinn et al 2019 all suggest that for wales in the future the magnitude duration and frequency of extreme high and low streamflows will increase in terms of observed differences between z2 and z3 abstraction types a smaller magnitude of decline is observed for change in total abstraction in z2 abstractions compared to z3 in the medium and long term as well as lack of statistical significance this suggests that z2 abstractions are potentially more resilient to climate induced streamflow change in terms of annual total generation potential this is possibly caused by the greater volume of water that it is allowable to abstract at these locations being 1 3 times qmean as opposed to qmean only in z3 abstractions this difference allows for z2 abstractions to make greater use of larger magnitude flows and the observed increases in number of days amax is reached annually this is further exemplified in the fact that z2 abstractions on average in both the medium and long term have a larger increase in the number of days amax is reached than z3 abstractions while differences are seen for certain aspects between the two abstraction conditions zone types little difference in observed trends is seen when comparing the two catchments this lack of variation is likely due to the fact that the vast majority of the currently operating schemes and therefore those studied are located in the uppermost reaches of the catchments predominantly on first order streams this positioning leaves little time for lulc differences to cause impact to run off generation and streamflow significantly between catchments the same is true for topographical characteristics with the majority of abstractions being located in topographically homogenous areas across the two catchments while all four of the factors studied are important for hep scheme design perhaps the most important in terms of future profitability is total abstraction for all time periods catchments and abstraction zones a decline is observed suggesting less generation output in the future 4 2 public water supply when viewing the unmet demand trend analysis results with the streamflow and demand trends it can be seen that streamflow is the major factor rather than water demand in particular large declines observed in summer and autumn streamflow lead to continued shortages of water even in the reduced demand scenario similarly to hep the characteristics of future streamflow change also correspond with the difference seen between the medium and long term trend analysis conducted for pws unmet demand spring streamflows increase considerably from the mid 2040s while winter flows display a small increase annual streamflow volume remains relatively stable throughout increases in winter and spring streamflows however do not factor into annual mean and total unmet demand as streamflow is continually sufficient during these seasons this means there is no offset for the increased demand and decreased streamflow seen in summer and autumn leading to an increase annually in the number of days and volume of unmet demand under all scenarios this problem is particularly pronounced in the medium term with both summer and autumn streamflow declining most steeply up to the mid 2050s these results agree with published literature with studies such as sanderson et al 2012 henriques et al 2015 and afzal and ragab 2019 projecting large decrease in water availability by the 2050s and beyond for the uk and wales specifically furthermore the findings are commensurate with reports from organisation such as the asc 2016a stating more action is needed to tackle future water supply security welsh government 2015 detailing the necessary steps for resilience in welsh water supply and for catchments reliant on river based abstraction such as tywyn aberdyfi and pembrokeshire dcww 2019b imbalances observed could lead to problems for water supply especially in times of prolonged drought as increases in winter and spring flow will do little to combat summer and autumn shortages if reservoirs are already full 4 3 study implications with regards to hep abstractions due to lack of scheme specific data the results represent an indication of future change in generation potential and timing for the study catchments and more broadly for catchments across wales and the 364 hep projects there within welsh government 2019 for example seasonal shifts in streamflow and therefore generation capacity will likely still impact on specific scheme layouts in a similar way to that that has been assumed in this study the results are therefore helpful in planning future schemes and more generally alteration in uk energy mix significantly less generation is expected to be possible in the summer and autumn in the future which will be important to consider when planning the future resilience of the energy network overall the results show that in the medium term 2021 2054 abstraction characteristics and potential at installed hep generation sites is likely to change greatly compared to the baseline this is significant as this period falls at the end of the general lifespan of small hydroelectric projects 40 years built in the last and upcoming five years hatata et al 2019 killingtveit 2019 for those sites under development in the next five years it may be beneficial to review scheme design in view of future flow conditions for example by installing a larger turbine to make more use of increase in high flows thus maximising generation potential over the lifetime of the project in the longer term the magnitude of observed changes is smaller for all factors except total abstraction than the medium term therefore when site redevelopment and replacement opportunities arise in the future it will be important to once again looking at future projected change to best determine the most efficient scheme upgrades and alterations in terms of pws while the specific abstraction studied may be relatively resilient to future changes in streamflow due to the supporting flow provided by the large upstream reservoir the results of this work could have important implications for other non supported direct river abstractions the changes in streamflow and results on unmet demand demonstrated in this study if applied to other catchments in wales and the uk could have major implications for future water supply sustainability the increases in unmet demand that have been observed even under a decreased demand scenario clearly suggests that the pace of change in reduction of water demand by processes such as leakage reduction and domestic water use education and awareness raising needs to be implemented as soon as possible these measures should certainly be the first step in ensuring future water supply security rather than large infrastructure projects to increase supply in all but the most pressing of cases the results and implications of this work can also be paralleled to other large water abstractors in the region which will be operating under the same streamflow regime changes industrial and agricultural users in particular could face challenges causing alterations in operation practices and timing due to lack of available water especially for those abstracting directly from rivers and streams the abstraction location and use data used to identify run of river hep schemes for this study details over 217 surface water based abstractions used for industrial and commercial purposes and a further 444 used for agriculture across wales these numbers highlight the potential scale of impact of future hydrological regime changes and the need to act now to ensure resilience to such changes 5 conclusions this research has demonstrated clear trends in future availability of water for the hep locations studied in the conwy and tywi catchments as well as the major pws abstraction in the tywi our results highlight that spring and autumn are the seasons most affected long term by water availability while winter and summer are more impacted in the medium term the results also demonstrate the need for action now especially in terms of the planning and design of hep installations schemes and turbines must be designed with future streamflow patterns in mind in particular increasing winter and spring flows rather than decreasing summer and autumn flows thus allowing for the maximisation of power generation over the course of a year additionally regardless of future demand decline increased pressure is likely to be placed on pws due to large declines seen in future streamflows therefore careful planning is also required here in order to ensure continued water supply finally we suggest avenues of future research firstly the impact of different climate change emissions scenarios on future hep output and pws availability is required at a national scale while a worst case scenario approach has been taken in this study it is paramount to consider the range of potential outcomes under different emissions pathways to ensure that the most proportionate future planning and adaptation measure are undertaken furthermore research on specific hep schemes with historical generation data would be highly beneficial as this would allow future climate change scenarios to be tested after calibration with actual data giving a better understanding of how future hydrological regime change will impact on generation potential secondly further research taking a holistic view of all catchment abstractions is needed including industrial commercial and agricultural purposes as well as pws and hep this approach would give greater insight to how total catchment water demand will impact on individual water users as well as the catchment as a whole in addition to this the inclusion of impacts of other climate change mitigation measures such as upland management for flood control would give a complete picture of future potential alterations this holistic catchment level approach would give the best chance of ensuring fair and equitable distribution of changing future water resources credit authorship contribution statement richard j h dallison conceptualization methodology software formal

giving context to management planning to ensure future pws sustainability and hep generation efficiency keywords hydroelectric power hydroclimatic change hydrological modelling trend analysis water resource management water supply demand balance 1 introduction climate change is a key driver of hydrological regime alteration globally with prevailing weather conditions being inextricably linked with streamflow given the dependence of society on river systems for everyday life it is of great importance to understand how climate change will impact water resource availability in the uk it is widely accepted that climate change will lead to hotter drier summers and warmer wetter winters as well as an increase in the magnitude frequency and duration of extreme weather events asc 2016a lowe et al 2018 in terms of streamflow an exacerbation of low and high flows is expected as well as a reduction in average summer and autumn flows and an increase in winter and spring average flows these opposing trends should leave annual averages relatively stable christierson et al 2012 kay et al 2020 prudhomme et al 2012 watts et al 2015 climate change and streamflow responses in wales specifically are projected to be in line with the trends suggested for the rest of the uk with summer mean and maximum temperatures as well as winter total and extreme precipitation volumes predicted to increase asc 2016b kay et al 2020 these changes have the potential to cause a large impact on major water consuming sectors such as agriculture heavy industries public water supply pws and hydroelectric power hep generation the adaptation sub committee asc of the committee on climate change for example suggests that pws and agricultural water demand for irrigation could be two of the most pressurised sectors in the uk under future climate and streamflow changes with demand potentially outstripping available water resources asc 2016a furthermore arnell and delaney 2006 detailed how even at that time of publication pws companies in england and wales would need to adapt to ensure sufficient raw water resources due to changes to low flow regimes in wales carless and whitehead 2013 demonstrate decreasing summer and autumn streamflows with corresponding increases in winter and spring in the given context of a theoretical 99 kw micro hep installation this causes an accentuation of seasonality in terms of energy generation with extra supply in wetter seasons compensating for lower supply in drier seasons leading to an annually stable situation carless and whitehead 2013 however these changes are likely to be catchment specific depending on the individual catchment s topographic and land cover characteristics as well as the prevailing weather patterns in 2018 renewable energy accounted for 25 of the total electricity generated in wales with hep making up 5 2 of this and therefore 1 3 of overall welsh electricity generation welsh government 2019 a large increase in the number of small scale hep schemes has occurred in the last eight years due to financial incentives in the form of feed in tariffs fit welsh government 2019 and also given that most opportunities for large scale schemes have been exhausted carless and whitehead 2013 however due to the curtailment of the fit scheme in 2019 the number of new developments has slowed with further schemes only likely to be commissioned where conditions are optimal welsh government 2019 these types of schemes usually run of river in design generally have little or no water impoundment making them particularly vulnerable to changes in hydrological conditions run of river hep schemes are usually designed and optimised on the basis of historical flow with flow duration curves used to set abstraction conditions while this method is a good starting point for designing the most efficient system to maximise power output it neglects to account for future streamflows climate change has the potential to cause major alteration to the hydrological characteristics of river systems modifying the timing and quantity of available water high and low flows are particularly likely to be affected asc 2016b kay et al 2020 sayers et al 2015 watts et al 2015 and these extreme flows are often important in terms of hep scheme design in 2017 the welsh government set a target for 70 of electricity consumed in wales to be generated by renewables by 2030 welsh government 2019 hep plays a small but important role in reaching this target especially in the winter and spring seasons when electricity generation from other sources such as solar pv is lower therefore understanding the nature of change in the abstractable flow for hep schemes under future climate change is crucial this will allow for more robust planning of the future energy mix in wales as well as maximisation of resource use efficiency and electricity generation pws also relies heavily on surface waters in wales with over 95 of the supplied water originating from rivers and lakes dcww 2019a in wales pws is largely under the authority of dŵr cymru welsh water dcww who provide an average of 800 million litres of water per day to over three million people dcww 2019b while the majority of surface water used is from lakes and reservoirs a substantial proportion is taken from lowland river abstractions especially for rivers in south wales such as the wye usk and tywi which are often supported by upstream reservoirs in times of very low flow dcww 2019b while the water supply system in wales is largely resilient to climate change due to the amount of water stored changes in climate still do have the ability to change the required water management and places greater pressure on the system asc 2016b the asc report a 12 supply demand surplus for pws in wales however this is set to decline under projected population growth and climate change with three of dcww s water resource zones expected to be in deficit by the 2080s asc 2016b dcww 2019a projected increases in the occurrence of low flows will impact how often pws and hep operators are permitted to abstract water from rivers in the future with stringent hands off flow hof regulations applied to abstractions to ensure the protection of low flows downstream in addition a greater occurrence of large flow events will potentially be of little use to abstractors to compensate for less abstraction potential due to low flows if system capabilities such as turbine size for hep do not allow for it it is therefore important to study these future changes now to successfully plan for systems that are resilient to climate change and make the most of available future flows in this paper we study the impact of climate change on two catchments in wales the conwy and tywi especially in terms of future water availability for small scale hep generation and pws this is a less studied region of the uk in this regard due to the perceived abundance of water resources in wales however owing to both the reliance on surface waters for pws and the large recent increase in small scale hep projects this is an important area in which to understand future water resource changes 2 data and methods 2 1 study catchments our two study catchments conwy and tywi fig 1 were selected due to their contrasting physical characteristics especially in terms of catchment land use land cover lulc mean catchment slope and catchment area table 1 all potentially giving rise to differences in hydrological regime these catchments are also exploited for their water resources in the form of hep and pws with natural resources wales nrw providing abstraction licenses for non impoundment run of river hep schemes in both the conwy and tywi nrw 2019 both catchments are also used for pws however only the tywi catchment has an abstraction taken directly from the river with pws in conwy sourced from reservoirs only dcww 2019b the downstream river based abstraction in tywi is supported in times of low flow by upstream releases from the llyn brianne reservoir dcww 2019a this abstraction supplies the largest drinking water treatment plant in dcww s network serving a population of 400 000 in swansea neath bridgend and the vale of glamorgan dcww 2019b making the abstraction an important location to study in terms of future water supply demand balance the conwy catchment is more mountainous in topography with a steeper mean slope and greater maximum elevation peaking 261 m higher than the tywi at 1062 m near the summit of snowdon the tywi catchment however has more than double the drainage area of conwy at 1365 km2 to conwy s 542 km2 table 1 the catchments are also contrasting in terms of lulc fig 1 with the tywi being dominated by agriculture pasture specifically 63 9 which is well distributed throughout all but the highest elevations in the catchment the conwy catchment on the other hand has a larger proportion of scrubland 42 1 in particular moors heathland 23 6 and natural grassland 16 6 mostly to the west of the main channel with the eastern side being more pasture dominated fig 1 the conwy also features a large peat bog in the south of the catchment accounting for 8 4 of total catchment lulc this is significantly more than is seen in the tywi table 1 forests cover a slightly larger area of the tywi 16 0 than the conwy 13 7 but the mix of forestry types is different with notably more coniferous forest in the tywi 10 1 while the conwy has equal proportions of coniferous and mixed forest 5 5 table 1 2 2 future streamflow and climate projections future streamflows for both catchments were modelled at a daily resolution for the hydrological years 2021 2079 using the physically based semi distributed continuous time step soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model arnold et al 2012 1998 neitsch et al 2011 swat has been used extensively in the context of future hydrological regime change and water resources assessment globally coffey et al 2016 khan et al 2020 perra et al 2018 sultana and choi 2018 yuan et al 2019 with publications focussing on both hep abera et al 2018 haguma et al 2017 park and kim 2014 shrestha et al 2016 and water availability bessa santos et al 2019 rivas tabares et al 2019 sharma et al 2016 veettil and mishra 2016 initial input data for swat were obtained from ordnance survey 5 m resolution os terrain 5 dem ordnance survey 2020 the eu soil database version 2 0 specifically the soil geographical database of eurasia a 1 1 000 000 scale vector dataset european commission 2004 and the corine land cover dataset copernicus land monitoring data eea 2012 the os terrain 5 dem is a high resolution raster dataset with a 5 metre post spacing ordnance survey 2017 and was chosen in order to provide the most accurate catchment delineation and water routing possible as well as to maintain computational efficiency for the size of catchments studied in terms of lulc the corine dataset was chosen due to the close match of lulc categories between it and the pre exiting swat lulc categories allowing for easy input to and interpretation by the model the corine dataset is accurate spatially to within 25 m with a minimum mapping unit of 25 ha for areal features and width of 100 m for linear features the accuracy of identified lulc type is greater than 85 eea 2017 the calculation of swat soil parameters was completed using the pedo transfer function developed by saxton and rawls 2006 based on the characteristics associated with the given world reference base for soil resources fao 1998 classification of each soil type additionally historical daily weather data air temperature and precipitation and streamflow data both used for model calibration and validation was sourced from the centre for ecology and hydrology s ceh climate hydrology and ecology research support system chess dataset robinson et al 2017 and the national river flow archive dataset nrfa 2020 respectively the gridded chess dataset was chosen due to its complete coverage across the catchments especially when compared to data from individual meteorological stations of which there are few with long complete and consistent records for the area chess precipitation data is based on the ceh 1 km gridded estimates of areal rainfall gear dataset which is an interpolated dataset based on meteorological station rainfall observations adjusted for topography to provide full uk coverage keller et al 2015 temperature data for chess is downscaled to a 1 km grid also taking account of topographical data from the 0 5 degree gridded climate research unit time series version 3 21 dataset cru ts3 21 which is also based on meteorological station observations harris et al 2014 in order to provide a single dataset of each climatic variable for each catchment the mean value of all grid cells contained with a catchment was calculated for each day of the study period it is this value after inspection for anomalies that has been used streamflow data was taken from gauges with as close to natural flow as possible station 66011 for conwy and 60006 for tywi the catchments were calibrated individually with the historical streamflow data for a 14 year period of 1985 1998 following a 3 year model warm up period we used the particle swarm optimisation pso method kennedy and eberhart 1995 for model calibration through the swat calibration and uncertainty programme swat cup with the kling gupta efficiency kge as the goodness of fit metric gupta et al 2009 pso is a complex but highly efficient method of calibration capitalising on swarm intelligence to iteratively improve the model performance by finding the optimal parameter values within a given range search space taking inspiration from flocking birds kennedy and eberhart 1995 in practice this entails a swarm of particles being initialised with each particle in the swarm randomly assigned a position and velocity the initial locations are evaluated for model fit and these automatically become each particles current best solution the group s best solution is set at the value of the particle with the best fit of all particles the individual particles then iteratively work towards with a random function a combination of their own and the groups best known position qi et al 2015 the process stops once either a given kge value is reached or the number of swarm iterations is reached whichever is sooner this method of calibration was chosen due to the simultaneous multiple parameter calibration required which can be accomplished by pso as well as its computational efficiency which was important due to the number of parameters and size of the catchments studied a total of 17 parameters table 2 were calibrated simultaneously these were selected based on a literature review of studies operating in similar catchment types the calibration kge values after 10 iterations with 10 particles 100 model runs per catchment were deemed acceptable at 0 770 for conwy and 0 841 for tywi a comparison of the observed and simulated streamflow for the calibration period is shown in fig 2 following implementation of the calibrated parameters values into swat we validated the model for the 1999 2014 period once again with a 3 year model warm up and obtained the kge values of 0 718 for conwy and 0 717 for tywi future streamflows were projected based on the weather input derived from the uk climate projections 2018 dataset regional projections on a 12 km grid over the uk for 1980 2080 mohc 2018 the most recent projections available for the uk these projections allow for the use of an ensemble of twelve regional climate models downscaled from the 60 km hadgem3 gc3 05 global coupled model for more information on these projections we direct the reader to murphy et al 2018 this projected future climate input is based on a worst case scenario of future global greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the form of representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp8 5 from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc rcp8 5 represents one of the worst emissions outcomes of a no policy scenario with high population growth continued coal use and no downturn in global ghg emissions riahi et al 2011 van vuuren et al 2011 leading to a scenario of radiative forcing still rising by 2100 and not peaking until the 2200s moss et al 2010 van vuuren et al 2011 this is an extreme future scenario in the 90th percentile of future modelled outcomes of no climate change mitigation van vuuren et al 2011 and has been used in this research despite the higher levels of uncertainty associated with it due to the critical nature of the study subject in particular pws to ensure an uninterrupted future pws it is vital to take account of such a scenario to allow for robust planning in addition in a future society where renewable energy is likely to make up a larger part of the overall energy mix understanding the potential fluctuation in hep generation caused by alteration in streamflows under climate change is highly important a summary of future temperature precipitation and streamflow is shown in fig 3 the data shown for all three factors is based on the average of all twelve downscaled regional climate model ensemble members temperatures are projected to increase in all seasons while precipitation and streamflow both increase in the winter and spring but decrease in the summer and autumn leading to a small overall annual reduction 2 3 hydroelectric power assessment assessment of changes in the abstraction regime for hep locations was undertaken for non impoundment run of river based schemes only of which there are a total of sixteen in conwy and nine in tywi abstraction locations were obtained from nrw due to lack of specific information pertaining to each hep scheme such as abstraction licence conditions scheme layout generation capacity etc abstraction conditions were based on general licensing guidelines laid out by nrw nrw 2020 guidance from the organisation states that for schemes creating a depleted reach i e run of river schemes and that do not operate on rivers supporting salmon spawning or protected species there are two types of abstraction permitted zone 2 z2 and zone 3 z3 nrw 2020 it was assumed for the purposes of this study that all schemes operate under z2 or z3 a summary of the conditions placed on abstraction rates of these zones is made in table 3 schemes are categorised into either zone based on the gradient of the depleted reach with those below 10 gradient being z2 and those above being z3 as information on the actual depleted reach was not available the average slope of the sub basin immediately downstream of the abstraction location was taken and the corresponding zone type applied fig 4 under the assumption that each hep site abstracts the maximum amount of flow available to it and given daily average streamflow q eqs 1 and 2 were used to calculate daily average abstraction volume a d a i l y at each location in line with abstraction rates dependent on the site zone 1 q s u r p l u s q h o f where h o f represents the compensation hands off flow release required to protect low flows and q s u r p l u s is the amount of water available for abstraction used to calculate a d a i l y 2 a d a i l y q s u r p l u s q t a k e 0 a m a x a d a i l y i f a d a i l y a s t a r t i f a d a i l y a m a x i f a s t a r t a d a i l y a m a x where q t a k e is the proportion of flow available for abstraction as per the zone conditions a s t a r t refers to the minimum abstraction volume required to start and for efficient operation of the turbine and a m a x represents the maximum permitted abstraction volume a further assumption was that an impulse turbine is in use at each site as is common with small scale hep schemes in upper catchment reaches such as those analysed in this study cobb and sharp 2013 lilienthal et al 2004 židonis et al 2015 impulse turbines have largely high and stable efficiency after approximately 10 of designed flow is achieved chitrakar et al 2020 novara and mcnabola 2018 paish 2002 making them ideal for settings with variable adaily cobb and sharp 2013 for this reason astart was set at 10 of amax for each scheme which is the assumed design flow volume 2 4 public water supply assessment an assessment of the impact of future hydrological regime change on pws was undertaken in the tywi catchment only due to the lack of river based pws abstraction in the conwy catchment the supply demand balance at the aforementioned single major abstraction location fig 4 was calculated using the water evaluation and planning weap system raskin et al 1992 yates et al 2005 weap is an integrated water resource management model that assimilates the demand and infrastructure management with physical hydrological processes and allows for multiple scenario analysis and comparison raskin et al 1992 yates et al 2005 the weap model has been used extensively for scenario analysis related to water resource planning and allocation in a variety of contexts such as the impacts of climate and land use change ashofteh et al 2013 esteve et al 2015 joyce et al 2011 purkey et al 2008 tena et al 2019 reservoir and dam operation planning azari et al 2018 demertzi et al 2014 mccartney and menker girma 2012 vonk et al 2014 ecosystem requirements and environmental protection thompson et al 2012 fatemi et al 2013 flores lópez et al 2016 momblanch et al 2020 and population increase and urbanisation impacts alamanos et al 2020 höllermann et al 2010 kumar et al 2017 toure et al 2017 however weap is not designed for detailed optimisation studies such as that required for hep yates et al 2005 for this reason the model has only been used in the pws analysis for this study future total daily water demand was calculated for three scenarios fig 5 representing increased static and declining abstraction requirement the increased demand scenario was based on the linear relationship between historical daily temperature and total water abstraction from the location as presented by dallison et al 2020 the water abstraction data was provided by dcww for january 2012 to december 2016 period the static demand scenario was based on the same 2012 2016 data with a mean for each day being taken across the 5 year dataset this year of mean values was then applied every year for the future period the decreased demand scenario used the same starting base as the static scenario with demand decreasing linearly by 20 across the period this decrease is in line with that projected in dcww s latest water resource management plan dcww 2019b based on an extensive leakage reduction programme and decreasing domestic water usage despite a projected increase in the population served a compensatory hof was also implemented in weap set at 681 91 million litres per day as laid out in the abstraction license for this location swwra 1965 total daily unmet demand d u n m e t was then calculated under each scenario using eq 3 3 d u n m e t q h o f d where d is daily total water demand q and h o f are defined as eq 1 due to the aforementioned system of reservoir low flow support by llyn brianne dunmet is therefore also assumed to be equal to the total daily required reservoir release 2 5 trend analysis trends in the output data from the hep and pws calculations were analysed using the mann kendall mk trend analysis kendall 1975 mann 1945 in line with other studies that have analysed data relating to hydrological regime change dallison et al 2020 jin et al 2020 mudbhatkal and amai 2018 murphy et al 2013 mwangi et al 2016 zaman et al 2016 2015 the non parametric test was deemed suitable due to the nature of hydrological data which is non normally distributed and exhibits seasonality the hamed rao method of auto correlation correction hamed and rao 1998 was applied along with sen s slope estimator sen 1968 to evaluate the direction and size of detected trends trends for all factors were analysed based on seasonal winter december to february spring march to may summer june to august autumn september to november and annual averages hydrological years or totals dependent on the factor hep trends for each catchment were analysed separately for the average of all z2 and all z3 abstractions the factors analysed were 1 number of days where adaily is greater than astart i e number of days generation is possible 2 number of days amax reached 3 mean adaily on days generation possible and 4 total seasonal annual abstraction for pws total unmet demand number of days demand unmet and mean unmet demand were all analysed under each demand scenario for both hep and pws the mean of the output of all twelve downscaled regional climate model ensemble members was used and is presented in the results section the mean of the twelve model runs has been used so as to take account of uncertainty in the future climate projections and therefore the generated streamflow data in addition the mk analysis was applied to the full 2021 2079 long term period as well as to the end of a medium term period 2021 2054 this approach is useful for hep as the near future analysis is more in line with the life span of recently installed and soon to be installed small scale systems hatata et al 2019 killingtveit 2019 for pws the near future analysis is a similar period as is currently being planned for 2050 being the end of the planning period for recently published water resource management plans e g dcww 2019b for wales specifically dcww also recently published a vision document to 2050 dcww 2018 hep and pws baseline 2021 2030 near future 2045 2054 and far future 2070 2079 decadal averages were also taken seasonally and annually for the same factors as the mk analysis to enable further visualisation of a potential medium and long term planning needs for both industries 3 results 3 1 hydroelectric power with regards to change in the number of days annually when astart is achievable all abstraction locations display a decrease in both the medium term 2021 2054 and long term 2021 2079 although these trends are statistically significant for more hep abstractions in the medium term analysis than in the long term fig 6 trends in the number of days when amax is reached are more variable especially in the long term with differences seen both within and between the two catchments the conwy in this period for example exhibits statistically significant increases for all abstractions in the west of the catchment while those on the eastern side vary with a statistically significant decrease being present for one location fig 7 in the medium term there is more agreement between abstraction locations with all but one z3 abstraction in each catchment seeing an increase in the number of days when maximum abstraction is achieved the combination of these two broad trends fewer days of abstraction but larger abstraction volumes available causes mean adaily on days when abstraction is possible to increase for the vast majority of locations in both time periods but especially so in the medium term fig 8 however when observing the change in total volume abstracted per year a decrease is displayed in all locations for both time periods fig 9 notably in the medium term trends for total abstraction all z3 abstractions had statistically significant p 0 05 decreases in volume while all z2 locations decline without statistical significance fig 9 the only factor which showed such a split figs 10 and 11 provide more details on the seasonal trends observed in the four factors studied for long term and medium term respectively examining the trends taking place in the 2021 2079 period it can be seen that the most significant change generally occurs in the spring and autumn with small declines in annual total abstraction and number of days astart is achieved in the medium term a greater number of statistically significant trends are seen in winter and summer with increases in annual mean adaily also being statistically significant total abstraction also varies considerably between the two periods with significant increases seen across both catchments and abstraction zones in winter and spring and decreases in summer and autumn leading to an overall decrease annually at the z3 abstractions in the medium term analysis little difference can be seen between the corresponding trends for the two catchments with trend direction agreeing in all but three occasions and few occasions of varying magnitude of change in terms of difference between the two abstraction types once again little variation is seen however when studying the percentage change from the baseline 2021 2030 annual average with the near and far future decadal annual averages table 4 large differences in the number of days amax is reached are shown between the zones in the far future average the z3 abstractions display a 9 decline in tywi and stay stable in conwy nonetheless the z2 abstractions increase quite significantly in both catchments 32 and 18 respectively few differences are seen between the zones catchments or time periods for the other factors studied finally with the exception of total abstraction the magnitude of change from the baseline is greater for the near future than far future 3 2 public water supply under all three demand scenarios in both the medium and long term we observe an increase in the number of days annually when streamflow is not sufficient to satisfy demand as well as an increase in the mean and total unmet demand volume fig 12 these trends are larger in magnitude for the 2021 2054 period and are also statistically significant for this period p 0 05 with the exception of mean unmet demand in the decreased demand scenario fig 12 no unmet demand is recorded at any point in the winter months under any scenarios whereas kendall s tau results suggest a decrease in unmet demand in spring especially in the medium term analysis although this is not statistically significant autumn displays the most consistency in trends across both time periods and the three demand scenarios with large magnitudes of change seen in total unmet demand and number of days demand unmet further analysis table 5 reveals that for all factors considered and under all demand scenarios the degree of change between the annual averages of the baseline and near future is much greater than that between the baseline and far future for example under the increased demand scenario total unmet demand is 167 higher than the baseline in the near future whereas the far future period is only 84 higher similarly for the number of days demand is not met in the static demand scenario the near future average is 151 higher than the baseline at 42 4 days per year compared to only 30 7 day per year in the far future period a 77 increase on the baseline of 17 2 days table 5 the same is true for mean unmet demand in the decreased demand scenario with the near future period being 49 higher than the baseline and the far future being only 10 greater 4 discussion 4 1 hydroelectric power the results of the mk trend analysis conducted on hep abstraction characteristics display a range of changes with most variation seen between the seasons and time periods studied rather than between catchments or abstraction zones these patterns are driven by the streamflow changes shown in fig 3 an example of this are the declines seen in spring and summer flows in conwy and tywi up to the late 2050s followed by an increase in summer flows to the end of the study period for tywi and a plateau for conwy autumn flows plateau after this point for both catchments these seasonal streamflow changes lead to the differences in trends observed in the mk analysis with larger and more statistically significant results being seen in the medium term than long for declines in mean abstraction number of days astart achieved and number of days amax reached changes in these factors in summer in particular are only significant in the medium term analysis due to the levelling off conwy and increase tywi seen in streamflow after this period this observed shift towards less days and volume of abstraction in the summer and autumn and an increase in the winter and spring is in line with previously published research for wales and the uk to our knowledge the only previous study that has investigated climate change impacts on hydropower in wales specifically is the aforementioned work of carless and whitehead 2013 their research presents trends in streamflow and potential hep output for streams in the upper severn catchment similar in nature to the abstraction locations studied in the present research a baseline 2020 and 2050 scenarios are considered with a marked decline in flow and power output in summer and early autumn months displayed in 2050 carless and whitehead 2013 winter and early spring months show a smaller magnitude increase for the same period leading to a stable situation annually carless and whitehead 2013 these results align well with that of our study s medium term trend analysis for total abstraction while no further studies use wales as a region of focus specifically other research based on the uk or regions thereof seems to be consistent with our results scotland for example which is comparable to wales due to the similar nature of catchments and also due to the high uptake of hep in the country sample et al 2015 summarises the research on the potential impacts of climate change on scotland s hep it is suggested that run off which is highly sensitive to climate change is closely linked to generation potential this relationship in line with the results of this study is projected to cause a decline in summer generation potential although this is likely to be offset in the winter hep schemes may be unable to make use of the higher flows due to design limitations sample et al 2015 further work in scotland by thompson 2012 on the impacts of climate change on streamflow also lend weight to the findings of this research once again suggesting an accentuation of low summer flows and high winter flows in the future these trends are also echoed on a uk scale by research such as uk ceh 2012 and kay et al 2020 both corroborating the seasonal and annual driving streamflow trends observed in the study catchments of this research furthermore the trends observed of mean abstraction volume increasing while total abstraction volume is decreasing suggests that there will be fewer days of abstraction in the future but with greater abstraction per day this trend also fits with the observed decrease in the number of days astart is reached and the increases seen in the number of days amax is achieved once again this is particularly pronounced in the medium term analysis and is supported by research on low and high flows in wales collet et al 2018 marx et al 2018 thober et al 2018 and visser quinn et al 2019 all suggest that for wales in the future the magnitude duration and frequency of extreme high and low streamflows will increase in terms of observed differences between z2 and z3 abstraction types a smaller magnitude of decline is observed for change in total abstraction in z2 abstractions compared to z3 in the medium and long term as well as lack of statistical significance this suggests that z2 abstractions are potentially more resilient to climate induced streamflow change in terms of annual total generation potential this is possibly caused by the greater volume of water that it is allowable to abstract at these locations being 1 3 times qmean as opposed to qmean only in z3 abstractions this difference allows for z2 abstractions to make greater use of larger magnitude flows and the observed increases in number of days amax is reached annually this is further exemplified in the fact that z2 abstractions on average in both the medium and long term have a larger increase in the number of days amax is reached than z3 abstractions while differences are seen for certain aspects between the two abstraction conditions zone types little difference in observed trends is seen when comparing the two catchments this lack of variation is likely due to the fact that the vast majority of the currently operating schemes and therefore those studied are located in the uppermost reaches of the catchments predominantly on first order streams this positioning leaves little time for lulc differences to cause impact to run off generation and streamflow significantly between catchments the same is true for topographical characteristics with the majority of abstractions being located in topographically homogenous areas across the two catchments while all four of the factors studied are important for hep scheme design perhaps the most important in terms of future profitability is total abstraction for all time periods catchments and abstraction zones a decline is observed suggesting less generation output in the future 4 2 public water supply when viewing the unmet demand trend analysis results with the streamflow and demand trends it can be seen that streamflow is the major factor rather than water demand in particular large declines observed in summer and autumn streamflow lead to continued shortages of water even in the reduced demand scenario similarly to hep the characteristics of future streamflow change also correspond with the difference seen between the medium and long term trend analysis conducted for pws unmet demand spring streamflows increase considerably from the mid 2040s while winter flows display a small increase annual streamflow volume remains relatively stable throughout increases in winter and spring streamflows however do not factor into annual mean and total unmet demand as streamflow is continually sufficient during these seasons this means there is no offset for the increased demand and decreased streamflow seen in summer and autumn leading to an increase annually in the number of days and volume of unmet demand under all scenarios this problem is particularly pronounced in the medium term with both summer and autumn streamflow declining most steeply up to the mid 2050s these results agree with published literature with studies such as sanderson et al 2012 henriques et al 2015 and afzal and ragab 2019 projecting large decrease in water availability by the 2050s and beyond for the uk and wales specifically furthermore the findings are commensurate with reports from organisation such as the asc 2016a stating more action is needed to tackle future water supply security welsh government 2015 detailing the necessary steps for resilience in welsh water supply and for catchments reliant on river based abstraction such as tywyn aberdyfi and pembrokeshire dcww 2019b imbalances observed could lead to problems for water supply especially in times of prolonged drought as increases in winter and spring flow will do little to combat summer and autumn shortages if reservoirs are already full 4 3 study implications with regards to hep abstractions due to lack of scheme specific data the results represent an indication of future change in generation potential and timing for the study catchments and more broadly for catchments across wales and the 364 hep projects there within welsh government 2019 for example seasonal shifts in streamflow and therefore generation capacity will likely still impact on specific scheme layouts in a similar way to that that has been assumed in this study the results are therefore helpful in planning future schemes and more generally alteration in uk energy mix significantly less generation is expected to be possible in the summer and autumn in the future which will be important to consider when planning the future resilience of the energy network overall the results show that in the medium term 2021 2054 abstraction characteristics and potential at installed hep generation sites is likely to change greatly compared to the baseline this is significant as this period falls at the end of the general lifespan of small hydroelectric projects 40 years built in the last and upcoming five years hatata et al 2019 killingtveit 2019 for those sites under development in the next five years it may be beneficial to review scheme design in view of future flow conditions for example by installing a larger turbine to make more use of increase in high flows thus maximising generation potential over the lifetime of the project in the longer term the magnitude of observed changes is smaller for all factors except total abstraction than the medium term therefore when site redevelopment and replacement opportunities arise in the future it will be important to once again looking at future projected change to best determine the most efficient scheme upgrades and alterations in terms of pws while the specific abstraction studied may be relatively resilient to future changes in streamflow due to the supporting flow provided by the large upstream reservoir the results of this work could have important implications for other non supported direct river abstractions the changes in streamflow and results on unmet demand demonstrated in this study if applied to other catchments in wales and the uk could have major implications for future water supply sustainability the increases in unmet demand that have been observed even under a decreased demand scenario clearly suggests that the pace of change in reduction of water demand by processes such as leakage reduction and domestic water use education and awareness raising needs to be implemented as soon as possible these measures should certainly be the first step in ensuring future water supply security rather than large infrastructure projects to increase supply in all but the most pressing of cases the results and implications of this work can also be paralleled to other large water abstractors in the region which will be operating under the same streamflow regime changes industrial and agricultural users in particular could face challenges causing alterations in operation practices and timing due to lack of available water especially for those abstracting directly from rivers and streams the abstraction location and use data used to identify run of river hep schemes for this study details over 217 surface water based abstractions used for industrial and commercial purposes and a further 444 used for agriculture across wales these numbers highlight the potential scale of impact of future hydrological regime changes and the need to act now to ensure resilience to such changes 5 conclusions this research has demonstrated clear trends in future availability of water for the hep locations studied in the conwy and tywi catchments as well as the major pws abstraction in the tywi our results highlight that spring and autumn are the seasons most affected long term by water availability while winter and summer are more impacted in the medium term the results also demonstrate the need for action now especially in terms of the planning and design of hep installations schemes and turbines must be designed with future streamflow patterns in mind in particular increasing winter and spring flows rather than decreasing summer and autumn flows thus allowing for the maximisation of power generation over the course of a year additionally regardless of future demand decline increased pressure is likely to be placed on pws due to large declines seen in future streamflows therefore careful planning is also required here in order to ensure continued water supply finally we suggest avenues of future research firstly the impact of different climate change emissions scenarios on future hep output and pws availability is required at a national scale while a worst case scenario approach has been taken in this study it is paramount to consider the range of potential outcomes under different emissions pathways to ensure that the most proportionate future planning and adaptation measure are undertaken furthermore research on specific hep schemes with historical generation data would be highly beneficial as this would allow future climate change scenarios to be tested after calibration with actual data giving a better understanding of how future hydrological regime change will impact on generation potential secondly further research taking a holistic view of all catchment abstractions is needed including industrial commercial and agricultural purposes as well as pws and hep this approach would give greater insight to how total catchment water demand will impact on individual water users as well as the catchment as a whole in addition to this the inclusion of impacts of other climate change mitigation measures such as upland management for flood control would give a complete picture of future potential alterations this holistic catchment level approach would give the best chance of ensuring fair and equitable distribution of changing future water resources credit authorship contribution statement richard j h dallison conceptualization methodology software formal

8207,study region bago river basin of myanmar and also other selected areas in other asian countries study focus for reducing the uncertainty in quantification of flood damage the development of more reliable flood damage functions fdfs is crucial this study therefore primarily aims to improve the fdfs developed by win et al 2018 for rice crops by collecting detailed damage data on recent floods in the bago river basin of myanmar depth duration damage functions were developed for different growth stages of the rice crops we then assessed the flood hazard and rice crop damage in the study area by integrating a two dimensional diffusive wave rainfall runoff inundation model and developed fdfs for validation the developed fdfs was also applied in five selected river basins in five other asian countries for validation of the fdfs new hydrological insights for the region this study presents new fdfs for rice crops that enable the quantitative estimation of rice yield losses for different growth stages of the rice crops the estimated results regarding the flood damage to the rice crops agree reasonably with the reported data indicating better estimations mean absolute percentage error of 11 the developed fdfs can also be used in other areas in asia where fdfs are unavailable keywords flood hazard agriculture depth duration damage function survey validation 1 introduction agricultural production mainly rice production is a major source of income of farmers in most developing countries in asia and contributes to countries economies shrestha et al 2016a however it is often reduced by flooding in the flood prone areas bailey serres et al 2010 developing countries are particularly vulnerable to agricultural damage due to flooding flood damage to agricultural crops causes economic loss and also impacts food security and rural livelihoods ramakrishna et al 2014 therefore assessment of flood damage to agricultural crops is also an important part of flood risk management the flood damage estimation is also required to quantify flood risk meyer et al 2007 merz et al 2010 and for long term flood control planning land use regulations and emergency management herath 2003 furthermore a quick estimation of damage can also be used to allocate resources for recovery and reconstruction herath 2003 flood damage assessment requires detailed hazard analysis and flood damage can be assessed quantitatively using flood damage functions fdfs numerous researchers have presented fdfs and damage assessment methods for direct flood damage to physical property in urban or residential areas such as flood damage to residential buildings dutta et al 2003 zhang et al 2003 zhai et al 2005 pistrika 2010 okada et al 2011 ranger et al 2011 glas et al 2016 dottori et al 2016 shrestha et al 2016a dias et al 2018 zabret et al 2018 win et al 2018 kefi et al 2018 kheradmand et al 2018 komolafe et al 2019 thapa et al 2020 and household contents zhang et al 2003 zhai et al 2005 okada et al 2011 shrestha et al 2016a win et al 2018 the infrastructure detrembleur et al 2015 glas et al 2016 and industrial sectors pistrika 2010 ranger et al 2011 detrembleur et al 2015 zabret et al 2018 however there is limited research on the development of fdfs for the agricultural sector such as flood damage to rice crops hussain 1995 dutta et al 2003 chau et al 2015 samantaray et al 2015 shrestha et al 2016a nguyen et al 2017 2021 win et al 2020 and other crops dutta et al 2003 pistrika 2010 scorzini et al 2021 as brémond et al 2013 pointed out agricultural sector is likely to play a major role in future flood management strategies in addition rice crops are usually cultivated in low lying areas and are severely damaged when flooding occurs win et al 2018 2020 shrestha et al 2019 therefore better assessment of flood damage to the rice crops is essential in flood risk management fdfs for rice crops have been established to some extent in previous studies but their application in other areas has not been validated most fdfs developed in previous studies use three to four depth classes and or two to nine duration classes and associated potential damage hussain 1995 dutta et al 2003 mekong river commission secretariat mrcs 2010 chau et al 2015 samantaray et al 2015 kwak et al 2015 shrestha et al 2016a nguyen et al 2021 however the flood damage estimated using depth or duration categorized fdfs simplifies the damage within the range of the depth or duration categories rahman and di 2020 therefore depth duration damage functions that serve as continuous functions for rice crops and enable continuous damage estimation at any flood depth and duration should be developed to estimate rice crop damage rahman and di 2020 in addition some previous fdfs only depend on flood depth chau et al 2015 nguyen et al 2017 the flood yield loss of rice crops may also vary with the crop growth stage rahman and di 2020 win et al 2020 but only a few studies considered the growth stages of rice crops in the development of fdfs hussain 1995 shrestha et al 2016a win et al 2018 2020 nguyen et al 2021 shrestha et al 2016a developed fdfs for rice crops using the flood damage matrix published in 2013 by the bureau of agricultural statistics of the philippines for different growth stages of rice crops these fdfs show that the rice crop is completely damaged in the case of complete submergence of the crop when the flood duration is 7 days or longer however the flooding tolerance of rice plants in complete submergence which is defined as their ability to resist some flooding for certain days of complete submergence and the potential to avoid damage or recover even partial yields after the flood recedes singh et al 2017 win et al 2018 has been reported to be longer than two or three weeks in other areas mekong river commission secretariat mrcs 2010 win et al 2020 recently win et al 2018 2020 also established fdfs for the rice crop for the bago river basin of myanmar using flood damage data collected through questionnaires however these fdfs vary less with flood duration moreover they were established by using the survey data in bago township for the 2014 flood only better correlation between hazards and damage depends on flood characteristics and damage data for various flood scales in wider areas therefore further improvement in the development of fdfs is necessary to assess flood damage in the study area more efforts should be made to improve the fdfs including the collection of flood damage data for the validation of fdfs okada et al 2011 in this study flood damage refers to the negative impact of flood on exposed elements brémond et al 2013 according to brémond et al 2013 flood damage to agriculture can be categorized as direct damage damage due to direct flood exposure and indirect damage damage not directly due to flood exposure direct and indirect damage can be further categorized as instantaneous damage occurs during or immediately after the flood event and induced damage occurs later in time not immediately after flooding brémond et al 2013 the flood damage to rice crops considered in this study is direct instantaneous damage e g crop yield reduction due to flooding and rice crop damage is monetized on the basis of crop yield reduction our primary goal in this study is to improve the fdfs developed by win et al 2018 for assessing flood damage to rice crops by collecting flood damage data through individual household surveys this study consists of mainly two parts i questionnaire survey and development of new fdfs for rice crops by improving the fdfs presented in win et al 2018 and ii application and validation of developed fdfs we considered one of the most flood prone river basins in myanmar the bago river basin for study to develop fdfs we conducted detailed surveys using questionnaires in the flood prone areas from the upstream to the downstream parts of the study area and collected the flood hazards and damage data for various flood events by using data collected from the survey we developed new fdfs for the quantitative estimation of rice production losses since expert based knowledge was often used to develop fdfs for agricultural crops in previous studies hussain 1995 molinari et al 2019 scorzini et al 2021 expert based information was also considered to determine the threshold criteria of minimum damageable flood depth the fdfs for rice crops were defined as functions of flood depth and flood duration and were developed for different growth stages of the rice plant to assess flood damage to rice crops we presented a grid based distributed method that integrates the hydrologic hydraulic model and the developed fdfs flood damage to the rice crop for study area was assessed for the recent severe flood events and the calculated damage was compared with reported data for validation of the fdfs to demonstrate the applicability of the developed fdfs in other areas we also assessed flood damage to rice crops by applying developed fdfs in five selected river basins in five other asian countries the fdfs presented in this study enable us to quantitatively estimate the rice yield loss and the expected loss in monetary value for different growth stages of rice crops this can help in better management of flood risk in the future 2 the study area fig 1 shows the location of the bago river basin which is located in the bago region of myanmar the study area lies mainly in the three townships of bago district bago thanatpin and kawa townships the study basin catchment covers an area of 5280 km2 and the main river is approximately 331 km long zin et al 2015 the elevation in the upstream part of the basin ranges from 50 to 750 m while the downstream part is almost flat with an elevation below 10 m as shown in fig 1 the average annual rainfall at bago station is approximately 3300 mm zin et al 2015 fig 2 shows the annual maximum 4 day basin average rainfall and annual peak discharge at the bago station during recent years the maximum 4 day basin average rainfall during a recent severe flood event in 2018 was 310 mm approximately 18 year return period shrestha and kawasaki 2020 the flood peak during the 2018 flood was about 1247 m3 s in the bago river basin recent flood events in 2011 2014 2018 and 2019 caused serious damage to many paddy fields and houses win et al 2020 more than 40 000 ha of paddy fields were severely affected during these flood events 3 methodology for development of flood damage functions and validation 3 1 questionnaire survey and development of flood damage functions for rice crops 3 1 1 survey outline damage data from past flood events are important for the development of fdfs however such data are not readily available in many developing countries including the study area to fill the gap in available data field investigations and surveys were conducted in the flood prone areas of the bago river basin from october 22 to november 3 2019 a questionnaire was created and approved by the research ethics committee of the university of tokyo tokyo japan it was distributed to the individual households during the survey period the questionnaire was designed to collect three categories of information on agricultural production and damage i general information related to rice production ii data related to flood hazard and iii data related to rice crop damage information was collected on agricultural land and rice crop production including maximum height of rice plants the method of rice cultivation types of rice grown rice crop transplanting and harvesting times time from planting to harvesting and cropping patterns flood characteristics in the paddy field were collected which included the start date of flooding flood depth and duration in the paddy field finally agricultural crop losses and damage were collected which included the height of rice plants during flooding the number of days from rice planting to flooding the planted areas of rice crops inundated rice paddy fields expected rice yield from the inundated paddy field if not flooded actual rice yield from the inundated paddy field after flooding and total yield loss of the rice crop due to flooding in addition flood depth and duration in the yard of house of respondent were also collected with use of available flood maps from past years and simulation results of flood hazards frequent flood prone areas were identified in the bago thanatpin and kawa townships and flood prone villages were selected for the survey fig 1 the surveys were conducted by randomly selecting households the required survey sample size for the questionnaire on agricultural damage was 162 based on 844 000 population and with a desired confidence level of 90 and relative margin of 6 5 a total of 340 households were interviewed out of which 174 households were farmers whose paddy fields were inundated during recent floods which is higher than target sample size the households located in the main bago city or nearby areas do not have paddy fields they had flood damage to their residential buildings and assets only the combined area of paddy fields owned by the 174 farmers was about 552 ha in year 2019 the flood hazard and damage information were collected for recent years such as flood events in 2018 and 2019 and the past severe flood event in 2011 3 1 2 establishment of flood damage functions using survey data fdfs which show a relation between hazard and damage are important components in flood damage estimation and they provide the monetary value of flood damage or the percentage of damage accounting for the total value of the exposed elements nguyen et al 2017 fdfs can be developed by using empirical or synthetic approaches messner et al 2007 merz et al 2010 the empirical approaches use actual flood damage data and hazard information collected after flood events while synthetic approaches use flood damage data collected via what if questions or expert estimations messner et al 2007 merz et al 2010 in both these approaches fdfs are generally developed by relating flood characteristics such as flood inundation depth duration and velocity with the resultant damage messner et al 2007 förster et al 2008 merz et al 2010 pistrika 2010 brémond et al 2013 shrestha et al 2018 in this study fdfs for agricultural crops rice crops were developed based on an empirical approach using damage data from past floods collected through questionnaires because maximum flood depth and duration can be easily obtained through surveys in the regions this study considered maximum flood depth and duration as the main factors causing flood damage to rice crops in addition the growth stage of the rice crop was also considered in the development of fdfs fig 3 shows the growth stages of the rice crop and the length of time the rice plant stays in each growth stage based on information presented in previous researches international rice research institute irri 2007 bureau of agricultural statistics bas 2013 the growth stages of the rice crop can be classified as a vegetative stage a reproductive stage a maturity stage and a ripening stage harvesting phase international rice research institute irri 2007 prathumchai et al 2018 bureau of agricultural statistics bas 2013 we measured flood damage to rice crops in terms of yield loss which we defined as reduction in yield as a percentage resulting from the occurrence of the flood disaster the yield loss due to flooding was calculated using survey data as follows 1 y i e l d l o s s 1 r i c e y i e l d f r o m t h e i n u n d a t e d p a d d y a r e a s a f t e r f l o o d i n g k g p e r h a e x p e c t e d r i c e y i e l d f r o m t h e i n u n d a t e d p a d d y a r e a s i f n o f l o o d i n g k g p e r h a x 100 total yield loss was also collected directly from the respondents during the surveys for cross validation of the yield loss calculated using eq 1 the collected information from the household surveys was also cross checked with village leaders and local staff of the irrigation and water utilization management department iwumd of myanmar to establish fdfs for the rice crop depth duration damage functions were used to calculate the percentage of yield loss of rice production expert based or synthetic based fdfs are usually developed in discrete form because detailed data are readily unavailable in many countries to develop damage curves or continuous functions hussain 1995 nguyen et al 2021 whereas empirical based fdfs are generally developed in the form of damage curves or continuous functions mekong river commission secretariat mrcs 2010 kwak et al 2015 shrestha et al 2016a nguyen et al 2017 win et al 2020 some previous studies already tested and applied linear relationships between crop yield reduction and flood parameters mekong river commission secretariat mrcs 2010 shrestha et al 2016a kwak et al 2015 molinari et al 2019 scorzini et al 2021 and found them reasonably applicable for practical use the present study also assumed a linear relationship between them and a multiple linear regression model was used to analyze flood damage to rice crops and its factors the yield loss was the dependent variable and the flood depth and duration were the independent variables of the multiple linear regression model the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables was obtained using the data collected from the questionnaire the parameter values of the relationships were optimized using the least square method 3 2 application and validation of flood damage functions for validation the fdfs developed in this study were applied in the study area bago river basin and also in river basins in other asian countries such as the pampanga river basin prb philippines solo river basin srb indonesia chao phraya river basin cprb thailand lower mekong river basin lmrb cambodia and lower indus river basin lirb pakistan 3 2 1 application and validation in study area bago river basin 3 2 1 1 analysis of flood hazard the analysis of flood hazard characteristics is important for flood damage assessment to assess the hazard rainfall runoff processes and flood inundation were simulated using a hydrologic hydraulic model named rainfall runoff inundation rri model developed by sayama et al 2012 among other hydrologic hydraulic models the rri model is a two dimensional diffusive wave model capable of simulating rainfall runoff and flood inundation processes simultaneously the details on rri model can be found in sayama et al 2012 and sayama 2014 a digital elevation model dem for the study area developed by bhagabati et al 2020 was used for flood hazard simulation the dem with 450 m 15 arcseconds horizontal resolution was used in the rri model simulation the precipitation and water level data were collected from the department of meteorology and hydrology of myanmar the rri model was simulated using ground observed precipitation data to calculate flood characteristics the spatial distribution of rainfall was calculated based on the thiessen polygon interpolation method using precipitation data at bago zaung tu tharwady and kabaaye gauging stations sayama 2014 the observed outflow discharge at the zaung tu dam collected from the department of hydropower implementation of myanmar was also given as an input boundary condition the lateral subsurface flow in mountainous areas was computed based on darcy s law while the green ampt infiltration model was used to calculate the vertical infiltration through the soil layers in the low lying areas the global land cover by national mapping organizations glcnmo version 3 2013 which was developed by the secretariat of the international steering committee for global mapping iscgm kobayashi et al 2017 and the digital soil map developed by the food and agriculture organization were used to define initial parameters of the rri model on the basis of the availability of hydrometeorological or damage data recent flood events in 2014 2018 and 2019 were selected to calibrate and validate the parameters of the rri model the initial parameters of the rri model were fine tuned during the calibration process by comparing the calculated discharge with that observed at the bago station for the 2014 flood event the calibrated parameters were validated by comparing the calculated and observed discharges at the bago station the calculated flood depth duration and inundation areas were also compared with the observed data 3 2 1 2 exposure cropland the cropland areas paddy fields in the study area were defined using available global land cover map glcnmo version 3 2013 developed by the iscgm the spatial resolution of the land cover map is 15 arcseconds fig 4 shows the cropland of the study area the cropland areas were visually checked with google earth images the reliability of the areas was verified by importing the keyhole markup language kml files of the cropland areas into google earth the cropland areas were found to match google earth images the total cropland area in the study area is approximately 2134 km2 which covers approximately 40 of the entire study area 3 2 1 3 flood damage estimation the grid based distributed damage estimation model which integrates the flood hazard the exposed items and the damage functions was developed using the fortran programming language by using developed damage functions according to flood depth and duration flood damage to the rice crop can be estimated in monetary value using following equation 2 v o l u m e l o s s o f r i c e p r o d u c t i o n k g y i e l d l o s s 100 r i c e y i e l d k g p e r h a d a m a g e d a r e a s h a 3 d a m a g e v a l u e d a m a g e c o s t v o l u m e l o s s o f r i c e p r o d u c t i o n k g f a r m g a t e p r i c e p e r k g to estimate rice crop damage the farmgate price and the rice yield data obtained from the questionnaires were used in the calculation to apply an appropriate fdf according to the growth stage of rice plants the growth stage of rice plants during a flood event was identified based on the cropping calendar and the number of days at each growing stage the cropping calendar for the study area was also established based on information and data collected through surveys since data on rice crop damage to the study area in the 2014 and 2018 floods were already provided by previous studies the flood damage to rice crops was estimated for these flood events by using the developed fdfs to validate these functions then the fdfs for the rice crop was validated by comparing the calculated results of damage with reported data for 2014 and 2018 flood events 3 2 2 application and validation in other areas to check the applicability of the fdfs in other areas we applied the fdfs developed in this study in the river basins of other countries flood damage to the rice crop was estimated using the developed fdfs in the prb srb cprb lmrb and lirb these river basins were selected for application of developed fdfs in other areas because flood hazard and damage data for these river basins have already been available in previous researches sayama et al 2012 2015 perera et al 2015 shrestha et al 2018 2019 in addition the recent floods caused severe damage to the rice crop in these areas the developed fdfs can be applicable to the selected river basins as similar types of rice crop are grown in south and southeast asian countries grisp 2013 shelley et al 2016 for the application of the fdfs to other areas the hazard simulation results of the rri model flood depth and duration which have been calibrated and validated in previous studies were obtained from previous works for the largest recent flood events for those areas prb and srb data from shrestha et al 2019 cprb data from sayama et al 2015 lmrb data from perera et al 2015 and lirb data from sayama et al 2012 the flood damage to rice crops for these river basins was estimated by applying the developed fdfs to severe past flood events the flood event in 2011 for prb cprb and lmrb the flood event in 2007 for srb and the flood event in 2010 for lirb table 1 the results of the rri model for these areas have already been validated by previous authors for the considered flood events by comparing calculated discharges and flood inundation extent areas with observed discharge and available flood maps a detailed explanation of the rri model calibration and validation for prb can be found in shrestha et al 2016a 2019 for srb in kudo et al 2016 and shrestha et al 2016b 2019 for cprb in sayama et al 2015 for lmrb in perera et al 2015 and shrestha et al 2019 and for lirb in sayama et al 2012 table 1 the damage estimation conditions such as paddy field rice yield farmgate prices and growth stages of the rice crop during the flood event were the same as those reported in shrestha et al 2018 2019 flood damage was estimated by applying appropriate fdfs based on the growth stage of the rice crop during flooding based on the growth stage of the rice crop and the rice cropping pattern rice crops in prb cprb lmrb and lirb were at the maturity stage during the target flood event shrestha et al 2018 2019 by contrast the rice crop was at the vegetative and maturity stages in the downstream and upstream parts of srb respectively shrestha et al 2016b the estimated values of rice crop damage using the developed fdfs were compared with the reported data the estimated value of rice crop in the case of the prb were compared with the reported data at the municipality level because the reported data were available at the municipality level for this basin however the basin level data were compared for the other river basins 4 results 4 1 survey results based on the information collected from the questionnaires the representative cropping calendar and patterns in the region were formulated as shown in fig 5 they usually cultivate rice paddies during the monsoon period from june to early november no other major crops are cultivated in these areas during that time period during the winter and summer periods rice paddy summer paddy and other crops beans green peas and peanuts are cultivated from late october to march for rice crop planting during the monsoon season seeding and preparing seedbeds are usually done in june the farmers transplant the rice seedlings from mid june to early july the rice paddies in the study area are harvested from october to early november table 2 shows the summary statistics of data on rice cultivation and production collected from the survey based on survey data the average time from seeding or seedbed to harvesting stages of the rice crop is about 134 days which is similar to the duration of rice crop cultivation presented in fig 3 according to the questionnaire responses the maximum heights of the rice crops were mostly 100 130 cm which was also confirmed via measurement in several paddy fields the measured heights of the rice crops ranged from 110 cm to 130 cm the spatial average value of the rice yield from different paddy fields in the areas based on survey data was about 2958 kg per ha the farmer s rice paddy selling price was about 216 kyats per kg on average spatial average the average cost of input value for rice cultivation was about 383 425 kyats per ha the survey data in detail are presented in supplementary material fig 6 shows the frequency distributions of flood depth and duration in the paddy fields of surveyed data for the 2011 2018 and 2019 flood events flood depth in the paddy fields was often under 3 m however some farmers also experienced flood depths greater than 3 m in their paddy fields during the 2011 and 2018 floods the figure also shows that many of the farmers interviewed recorded flood durations longer than 20 days in their paddy fields during the 2011 2018 and 2019 flood events 4 2 establishment of flood damage functions fdf for rice crop varies with each growing stage in the study area flooding mainly occurs during the vegetative reproductive and maturity stages of the crop and fdfs were thus developed for these stages from the surveys of this study and previous studies win et al 2018 2020 it was observed that there was no rice crop damage found in the areas during the ripening stage harvesting phase because at this stage occurs during the end of the monsoon season in the current study expert based knowledge was also considered to determine the values of threshold criteria such as minimum damageable flood depth and flooding submergence tolerance duration flood water can be beneficial to rice plants at a certain flood depth and duration mekong river commission secretariat mrcs 2010 according to information collected from discussion with local experts of the iwumd together with some farmers flood damage to the rice crop occurs in the study areas if the flood depth is over 0 4 0 5 m and the duration is longer than 3 4 days similar values were also adopted by previous researcher for bago river basin win et al 2020 the damage curves developed by win et al 2020 show that rice crop damage occurs if flood depth is higher than 0 4 m in the vegetative and reproductive stages the curves also show that no damage occurs if flood duration is less than 3 days based on information collected from local experts and farmers and referring to previous researches hussain 1995 mekong river commission secretariat mrcs 2010 kwak et al 2015 shrestha et al 2016a win et al 2020 this study assumed that rice crop damage occurs if the flood depth is higher than 0 4 m in the vegetative stage and higher than 0 5 m in the reproductive and maturity stages this is considered the minimum damageable flood depth it was also assumed that damage occurs if flood duration is greater than 3 days referring to previous literature win et al 2018 2020 and expert based information collected from the discussion with local experts together with some farmers rice crops in the study area are completely damaged by the flood when the rice crop is fully submerged in flood for longer than 3 weeks if the water level reaches over the height of the rice plants it is considered to be complete crop submergence when the rice crop was completely submerged the yield loss was assumed to be the same as that at the starting level of complete submergence slcs the flood damage mechanism considering temporal changes in the height of rice plants in each growth stage is complex and the understanding of the mechanism requires more detailed research and data therefore for simplicity this study used the maximum height of rice plants in each growth stage previous researchers also usually used the maximum height of rice plants in the development of fdfs mekong river commission secretariat mrcs 2010 kwak et al 2015 shrestha et al 2016a win et al 2020 by referring to fig 3 and previous researches mekong river commission secretariat mrcs 2010 kwak et al 2015 shrestha et al 2016a win et al 2020 this study assumed that the slcs is 1 0 m for the vegetative stage and 1 3 m for the reproductive and maturity stages by using data collected from the survey questionnaires and above assumption of minimum damageable flood depth the fdfs for the rice crop was developed for the vegetative reproductive and maturity stages as follows 4 y i e l d l o s s h f l o o d h m i n a b d f l o o d i f h f l o o d s l c s h f l o o d f l o o d d e p t h a t s l c s i f y i e l d l o s s 0 y i e l d l o s s 0 i f y i e l d l o s s 100 y i e l d l o s s 100 where h f l o o d is the flood inundation depth in m h m i n is the minimum damageable flood depth in m d f l o o d is the flood duration in days and a and b are constant parameters that vary depending on growth stages the values of the parameters for each growth stage are presented in table 3 the values of r2 and adjusted r2 of the regression analysis were 0 835 and 0 829 for the vegetative stage 0 854 and 0 847 for the reproductive stage and 0 834 and 0 813 for the maturity stage the model performance of the regression analysis was found to be good for all the growth stages the significance f value was less than 0 01 for all growth stages which indicated that the dependent and independent variables were statistically significant table 4 shows the descriptive statistics of each variable term of regression the p values for the variable terms of regression were less than 0 01 for all growth stages which indicated that the variables were statistically significant predictors the equation of fdfs developed in this study eq 4 can estimate flood damage at any given flood depth and duration for different growth stages of the rice crops by using the equation for damage functions flood damage curves are derived as presented in fig 7 the shape of the damage curves developed in this study is similar to that presented by mrcs 2010 kwak et al 2015 and shrestha et al 2016a when the rice crop is completely submerged rice crop is completely damaged 100 if the flood duration is 27 days or longer in vegetative and reproductive stages and 24 days or longer in the maturity which are similar to fdfs presented in win et al 2020 win et al 2020 fdfs showed that rice crops are completely damaged by the flood when completely submerged for a duration of 25 days or longer the damage curves developed in the present study showed that when the rice crop was completely submerged more than 50 damage can occur within 8 days of flooding at all growth stages this finding is similar to the yield loss value obtained from the damage curves presented by the mrcs 2010 and kwak et al 2015 60 damage can occur within 8 days of flooding however the damage curves presented by hussain 1995 showed that more than 60 damage can occur within 3 days of flooding in vegetative and reproductive stages and more than 40 in the maturity stage the damage curves presented by shrestha et al 2016a further showed that more than 50 damage can occur within 3 days of flooding for completely submerged rice crop at reproductive and maturity stages the slope of the damage curves developed in this study at the vegetative stage is steeper than that at reproductive or maturity stages flooding for a duration of 8 days and at a depth of 1 0 m can cause 50 40 and 36 rice crop damage in the vegetative reproductive and maturity stages the yield loss for the vegetative stage was the most severe which initiated complete damage during the 27 day flood duration with a flood depth of 1 0 m since the height of rice plants during the vegetative stage is shorter than that during the reproductive or maturity stages larger paddy field areas are affected by flood during the vegetative stage reddy and mittra 1985a 1985b win et al 2018 nguyen et al 2021 also pointed out that the effects of submergence on rice yield at the vegetative stage are more severe compared with those at the reproductive stage because the height of rice plants during the vegetative stage is shorter than during the other growth stages therefore the flood damage can be expected to be more severe at the early stage than the later growth stage moreover the developed damage curves show that the yield loss during complete submergence of rice plants at a duration of less than 16 days in the maturity stage is lower than that of the reproductive stage but is higher for a longer flood duration which was possibly due to the occurrence of more damage in the maturity stage of rice crops when the flood duration of complete submergence was prolonged bureau of agricultural statistics bas 2013 similar characteristics of damage at each growth stage of the rice plants were also found in fdfs developed by some previous researchers hussain 1995 bureau of agricultural statistics bas 2013 shrestha et al 2016a however some other researchers reddy and mittra 1985a zhang et al 2015 nguyen et al 2021 reported that rice crops are the most vulnerable to flood inundation during the ripening stage and are more robust in the reproductive stage the duration of rice crop cultivation in the study area was 134 days from seeding seedbed to harvesting stages however characteristic damage in cases of early maturity rice crops varieties characterized by cultivation time as short as 90 100 days may differ from that of rice in the study area kotera et al 2005 the plant heights for different growth stages of the rice crops considered by zhang et al 2015 and nguyen et al 2021 are shorter than those of the rice in the study area and reddy and mittra 1985a and zhang et al 2015 focused on yield loss under artificial flooding with clear tap water these factors may also explain different characteristics of rice crop damage the sensitivity of submergence tolerance of rice crops also depends on plant height of the rice crop kotera and nawata 2007 and rice crop damage characteristics caused by clear water may differ from that by muddy water zhang et al 2015 table 5 compares the considered variables and other factors in developed fdfs in this study with fdfs in previous researches the table also compares the minimum damageable flood depth adopted in this study with those in previous studies the depth duration damage fdfs developed in this study which is the continuous damage functions allow us to estimate flood damage at any given flood depth and duration for different growth stages of rice crop in the present study the flooding tolerance of rice plants in complete submergence for each growth stage of the rice plant and the thresholds of minimum damageable flood depth were also adequately considered when developing the fdfs 4 3 application and validation of fdfs 4 3 1 application and validation in bago river basin 4 3 1 1 results of flood hazard analysis fig 8 a c compares calculated discharges with observed discharges at the bago station for 2014 2018 and 2019 flood events the 2014 flood event was used for the calibration of the values of rri model parameters the calibrated parameters of the rri model were validated with the 2018 and 2019 floods the results show that the calculated discharges from the model agreed well with the observed discharges indicating high nash sutcliff coefficient of efficiency nsce and r2 coefficient of determination values the nsce and r2 values were 0 84 and 0 89 for the 2014 flood 0 69 and 0 76 for the 2018 flood and 0 71 and 0 82 for the 2019 flood the percent bias p bias was also found to be good for all the flood event cases p bias 9 3 for 2014 11 9 for 2018 and 24 for 2019 fig 9 compares calculated maximum flood inundation depth with measured flood depth marks collected from the field survey for 2018 and 2019 floods and fig 10 shows scatterplots of calculated flood depths versus measured flood depths for the 2018 flood the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and mean absolute percentage error mape between the measured and calculated flood depths were 0 49 m 0 43 m and 42 respectively and for the 2019 flood they were 0 38 m 0 39 m and 30 respectively there were minor discrepancies between measured and calculated flood depths but mape values indicated that the discrepancies between measured and calculated flood depths were reasonably acceptable mape values between 20 50 are generally acceptable moreno et al 2013 in addition the p bias values 16 for 2018 flood 19 for 2019 flood between the measured and calculated flood depths for 2018 and 2019 flood events also indicated reasonably acceptable performance of the rri model moriasi et al 2007 fig 11 compares the calculated flood extent areas of the 2018 flood event with probable flood extent based on available advanced land observing satellite alos 2 sentinel asia imagery for whole areas in the lower part of the basin as derived by san et al 2020 the results show that calculated flood extent areas are similar to possible flood extent areas interpreted from satellite imagery although some underestimation or overestimation in calculated flood extent areas was found in some locations the estimated and observed flood inundation areas for the 2018 flood were 973 and 938 km2 respectively the overlap area between estimated and observed inundation areas was 701 km2 the fit and correctness indices bates and de roo 2000 liu et al 2019 between the observed and estimated flood inundation areas for the 2018 flood were 58 and 75 respectively for whole areas in the lower part of the basin the rmse and mape values between the observed and estimated flood inundation areas were 34 km2 and 3 6 respectively overall the estimated flood inundation area for the 2018 flood was in reasonable agreement with the observed inundation area fig 12 compares calculated flood duration with the flood duration data collected through the survey questionnaires for the 2018 and 2019 flood events and fig 13 shows scatterplots of measured versus calculated flood durations the rmse mae mape and p bias values between measured and calculated flood duration for the 2018 flood were 9 days 7 days 37 and 26 respectively and for the 2019 flood they were 8 days 6 days 39 and 10 respectively the rmse and mae values for flood duration also indicated some discrepancies between measured and calculated values but overall the mape and p bias values supported reasonable agreement between measured and calculated flood durations some of the discrepancy between the observed and calculated flood depths or durations or inundation areas can be attributed to various reasons the calculated flood depth and duration were average values over the grid but the measured flood depth and duration were for a specific location which may vary due to local topographical undulation the main reason for underestimation or overestimation of calculated flood inundation areas was that the satellite imagery based flood extent analysis may interpret irrigation water ponding in a paddy field as flooded areas sayama et al 2015 shrestha et al 2019 also such analysis may not correctly detect flooded residential areas owing to double bounce scattering and shadow effects and may also misinterpret areas of vegetation zhao 2016 venama et al 2021 discrepancies between observed and calculated flood depths or durations or inundation areas can also arise from the accuracy of the topographical data used in the rri model simulation from the selection of a spatial scale such as grid size used in the rri model simulation and from the temporal resolution of input data such as hourly or daily rainfall data in addition the river width and depth at each river grid cell were approximated using empirical relationships in the rri model and such calculation may have influenced the results of the hazard analysis furthermore the initial conditions in the rri model before flooding and the validity of calibrated parameters may have influenced the agreement between observed and simulated results 4 3 1 2 validation of fdfs by using developed fdfs flood damage to the rice crop was estimated for 2014 and 2018 floods since fdfs were developed based on maximum flood inundation depth flood damage to rice crop was estimated using calculated maximum flood inundation depth the crop growing season during both of these flood events was in the monsoon season based on the number of days the rice plant spends in each growth stage fig 3 and the cropping calendar fig 5 the growth stages during the 2014 and 2018 floods were the reproductive stages the damage functions for the reproductive stage for both flood events were thus applied to estimate flood damage during those flood events in myanmar the reported data on agricultural damage are only available in terms of damaged paddy area therefore the calculated results of damaged paddy field areas were compared with reported damaged paddy areas for bago thanatpin and kawa townships for the validation of damage assessment table 6 compares the calculated results of the damaged paddy field area with reported data for the 2014 and 2018 floods the rmse and mape between reported and calculated damaged paddy field areas for 2014 flood were 2349 ha and 11 while they were about 5496 ha and 13 in the case of 2018 flood the results show that the calculated results of the damage paddy field areas agreed reasonably with the reported data with low rmse and mape values from this comparison we can confirm at least introduced threshold criteria for damage occurrence such as minimum damageable flood depth and also estimated damaged paddy area the validation of developed flood damage assessment method in terms of degree of damage or estimated damage in monetary value is discussed in sub section 4 3 2 for other river basins in asia 4 3 2 application and validation of fdfs in other areas for validation of flood hazard in other areas detailed data are unavailable to quantitatively validate calculated flood inundation results with observed data the available data on flood inundation for the prb include a flood mark map and average flood depth data for some villages however only satellite based observed flood maps are available for other basins which makes it possible only to visually compare the calculated flood extent areas with observed flood extent areas except for prb figs 14 and 15 compare the calculated flood extent areas with observed data for considered river basins observed flood maps are also presented in supplementary material overall the calculated flood extent areas reasonably agree with the observed flood extent areas in all the river basins fig s6 see supplementary material compares the calculated flood depth with the recorded flood depth for the areas located in prb for prb the rmse 0 04 m mape 19 and the p bias 3 values indicated that the calculated results of flood depth were in good agreement with the recorded flood depth fig 16 shows the calculated flood durations during the considered flood events for the selected basins the average flood inundation depth in all river basins was higher than 1 m during the target flood event primarily in the range of 1 2 m however the flood duration in each basin varied widely because of basin characteristics furthermore the flood duration ranged 1 2 weeks in prb and srb primarily and 3 4 weeks in lirb the flood duration in cprb and lmrb was longer than 2 months table 7 shows the comparison of estimated values of rice crop damage using developed fdfs with the reported value the results show that the flood yield loss was also well explained for the areas with durations of 1 2 weeks to more than 1 month the rmse and mape values are also shown in the table overall the estimated values of rice crop damage agreed reasonably with the reported values however the mape value was found relatively higher in some municipalities of prb 20 but within reasonably acceptable range the comparison results show that the fdfs developed in this study can be used in other areas in southeast asian and south asian countries where the rice crop styles and major types of cultivated rice are similar to those in the study area as scorzini et al 2021 pointed out previous researchers usually applied existing fdfs developed for other areas by just adjusting the values of farmgate prices and crop yield without any other adjustments in the assumptions made in the development of the fdfs because of limited available information on their development however some adjustments of the assumptions behind the fdfs might be necessary when those developed for a specific area are applied to estimate damage in other areas therefore when the fdfs developed in this study are used in other areas it is recommended to carefully check input data required for damage estimation based on local characteristics and also to validate estimated damage with reported data to confirm the reliability of estimated damage scorzini et al 2021 if necessary it is also recommended to adjust assumptions made for fdfs such as the minimum damageable flood depth and the height of rice plants as pointed out by scorzini et al 2021 also note that the developed fdfs can be used for any height of rice plants both flood tolerant and flood intolerant rice varieties by adjusting the height of rice plants and the minimum damageable flood depth 5 discussions in this study we developed fdfs for rice crops by improving the fdfs presented by win et al 2018 and validated the developed fdfs for the bago river basin of myanmar and also in other areas the key flood parameters considered in the development of fdfs are flood depth flood duration and growth stage of rice however various other parameters such as flow velocity and sediment concentration may influence flood damage to rice crops brémond et al 2013 brémond et al 2013 stated that flow velocity should be considered if most of the local flooding events are flash floods in the bago river basin most of the paddy areas are in low lying areas and flooding occurs mainly due to fluvial flooding or pluvial flooding i e the effect of flow velocity might be small nonetheless in some areas at the upper part of the basin where the land slope is relatively steeper and close to the riverbank it was observed during the survey that rice crop damage was severe even in short flood durations compared to rice crop damage in low land areas which was possibly due to a higher flow velocity we validated the developed fdfs by comparing the calculated results of the flood damage to the reported rice crops in the bago river basin and other areas we found that the calculated results agreed reasonably with the reported data however some discrepancies obtained between measured and calculated results of flood depth duration and inundation areas in the study area may have had some influence on the validation of the fdfs and further validation of the fdfs might be necessary for confirming the reliability of estimated damage when the developed fdfs is applied to assess flood damage and risk moreover mape value was higher than 20 in some municipalities of prb the reliability of damage estimation depends on not only the fdfs but also various other factors such as the quality of survey data methodology of counting reported damage data in the field and accuracy of the topographical and exposure data used in the assessment moreover the selection of the spatial e g grid or river basin scale and temporal e g daily or weekly or monthly scales and the input data type e g vector or raster data are crucial in maintaining the reliability of damage assessment results merz et al 2010 brémond et al 2013 shrestha and kawasaki 2020 in addition approximation of the river width and depth using empirical relationships the initial conditions in the rri model and also validity of calibrated parameters may have influenced the results of hazard analysis and damage estimation for the study area we also attempted to validate the calculated flood depth and duration with those obtained through the survey however the flood hazard results for areas from other countries were validated only by comparing the discharge and flood inundation extent with the observed data because of lack of observed flood depth and duration data in those areas the major rice type considered in this study for the development of fdfs was rain fed paddy whose maximum plant height is about 130 cm however the maximum plant heights of some other rice varieties such as deep water paddy might be higher than 130 cm and some adjustment of maximum plant heights and minimum damageable flood depth may be necessary to apply in other areas therefore this point should be noted when applying the fdfs developed in this study to other areas moreover the flood damage to rice crops was expressed as regards yield loss and rice crop damage was monetized on the basis of crop yield reduction however a comprehensive assessment of flood damage to agriculture sector requires complex analysis also involving assessment of the changes in production costs due to the flood loss of beneficial soils loss of paddy fields and damage to the standing farm equipment molinari et al 2019 scorzini et al 2021 the fdfs developed in this study can be applied to assess flood damage to rice crop and to evaluate effectiveness of flood preventive measures in order to reduce rice crop damage preventive measures and land use plans must be developed and implemented in the area these include establishment of flood protection measures and adequate drainage capacity and the use of submergence tolerant rice varieties in flood prone areas during the monsoon season 6 conclusions in this study we aimed to improve the fdfs presented by win et al 2018 for rice crops by collecting data on past flood hazards and damage through individual household surveys by distributing questionnaires in the flood prone areas of the study basin by using data collected through the survey we developed new fdfs for rice crops for the assessment of flood damage to rice crops for the bago river basin and also evaluated its applicability to other areas in asia the fdfs developed for the study areas were validated by comparing calculated damage with reported data the fdfs presented in this study enabled us to obtain a relationship between the flood hazards and the direct economic loss of rice crop damage the important flood parameters considered in the development of fdfs for rice crops are flood depth and duration in addition to flood parameters rice crop flood damage is also dependent on the growth stage of the rice crop the fdfs for different growth stages of rice crop are presented in this study and according to the rice crop growth stage during the flood event appropriate fdfs can be applied to estimate monetary value of rice crop damage the estimated results of flood damage to the rice crop using the developed fdfs for the study area and the applied river basins of other countries agreed reasonably with the reported data the fdfs presented in this study enable us to quantitatively estimate the losses in rice production and the expected monetary value of rice crop losses due to floods for different growth stages of the rice crops that can help better manage flood risk in the future the fdfs presented in this study can also be applied to assessing flood damage to rice crops in other areas where rice crop styles and the major types of rice grown are similar specifically in southeast asian and south asian countries in this study we have validated the applicability of the developed fdfs in the river basin of five countries in asia however further validation is also recommended to apply the fdfs presented in this study to other asian countries or countries outside asia in addition since the proposed fdfs were validated for large flood events further validation is necessary to check the applicability of the fdfs to small scale flood events credit authorship contribution statement badri bhakta shrestha

8207,study region bago river basin of myanmar and also other selected areas in other asian countries study focus for reducing the uncertainty in quantification of flood damage the development of more reliable flood damage functions fdfs is crucial this study therefore primarily aims to improve the fdfs developed by win et al 2018 for rice crops by collecting detailed damage data on recent floods in the bago river basin of myanmar depth duration damage functions were developed for different growth stages of the rice crops we then assessed the flood hazard and rice crop damage in the study area by integrating a two dimensional diffusive wave rainfall runoff inundation model and developed fdfs for validation the developed fdfs was also applied in five selected river basins in five other asian countries for validation of the fdfs new hydrological insights for the region this study presents new fdfs for rice crops that enable the quantitative estimation of rice yield losses for different growth stages of the rice crops the estimated results regarding the flood damage to the rice crops agree reasonably with the reported data indicating better estimations mean absolute percentage error of 11 the developed fdfs can also be used in other areas in asia where fdfs are unavailable keywords flood hazard agriculture depth duration damage function survey validation 1 introduction agricultural production mainly rice production is a major source of income of farmers in most developing countries in asia and contributes to countries economies shrestha et al 2016a however it is often reduced by flooding in the flood prone areas bailey serres et al 2010 developing countries are particularly vulnerable to agricultural damage due to flooding flood damage to agricultural crops causes economic loss and also impacts food security and rural livelihoods ramakrishna et al 2014 therefore assessment of flood damage to agricultural crops is also an important part of flood risk management the flood damage estimation is also required to quantify flood risk meyer et al 2007 merz et al 2010 and for long term flood control planning land use regulations and emergency management herath 2003 furthermore a quick estimation of damage can also be used to allocate resources for recovery and reconstruction herath 2003 flood damage assessment requires detailed hazard analysis and flood damage can be assessed quantitatively using flood damage functions fdfs numerous researchers have presented fdfs and damage assessment methods for direct flood damage to physical property in urban or residential areas such as flood damage to residential buildings dutta et al 2003 zhang et al 2003 zhai et al 2005 pistrika 2010 okada et al 2011 ranger et al 2011 glas et al 2016 dottori et al 2016 shrestha et al 2016a dias et al 2018 zabret et al 2018 win et al 2018 kefi et al 2018 kheradmand et al 2018 komolafe et al 2019 thapa et al 2020 and household contents zhang et al 2003 zhai et al 2005 okada et al 2011 shrestha et al 2016a win et al 2018 the infrastructure detrembleur et al 2015 glas et al 2016 and industrial sectors pistrika 2010 ranger et al 2011 detrembleur et al 2015 zabret et al 2018 however there is limited research on the development of fdfs for the agricultural sector such as flood damage to rice crops hussain 1995 dutta et al 2003 chau et al 2015 samantaray et al 2015 shrestha et al 2016a nguyen et al 2017 2021 win et al 2020 and other crops dutta et al 2003 pistrika 2010 scorzini et al 2021 as brémond et al 2013 pointed out agricultural sector is likely to play a major role in future flood management strategies in addition rice crops are usually cultivated in low lying areas and are severely damaged when flooding occurs win et al 2018 2020 shrestha et al 2019 therefore better assessment of flood damage to the rice crops is essential in flood risk management fdfs for rice crops have been established to some extent in previous studies but their application in other areas has not been validated most fdfs developed in previous studies use three to four depth classes and or two to nine duration classes and associated potential damage hussain 1995 dutta et al 2003 mekong river commission secretariat mrcs 2010 chau et al 2015 samantaray et al 2015 kwak et al 2015 shrestha et al 2016a nguyen et al 2021 however the flood damage estimated using depth or duration categorized fdfs simplifies the damage within the range of the depth or duration categories rahman and di 2020 therefore depth duration damage functions that serve as continuous functions for rice crops and enable continuous damage estimation at any flood depth and duration should be developed to estimate rice crop damage rahman and di 2020 in addition some previous fdfs only depend on flood depth chau et al 2015 nguyen et al 2017 the flood yield loss of rice crops may also vary with the crop growth stage rahman and di 2020 win et al 2020 but only a few studies considered the growth stages of rice crops in the development of fdfs hussain 1995 shrestha et al 2016a win et al 2018 2020 nguyen et al 2021 shrestha et al 2016a developed fdfs for rice crops using the flood damage matrix published in 2013 by the bureau of agricultural statistics of the philippines for different growth stages of rice crops these fdfs show that the rice crop is completely damaged in the case of complete submergence of the crop when the flood duration is 7 days or longer however the flooding tolerance of rice plants in complete submergence which is defined as their ability to resist some flooding for certain days of complete submergence and the potential to avoid damage or recover even partial yields after the flood recedes singh et al 2017 win et al 2018 has been reported to be longer than two or three weeks in other areas mekong river commission secretariat mrcs 2010 win et al 2020 recently win et al 2018 2020 also established fdfs for the rice crop for the bago river basin of myanmar using flood damage data collected through questionnaires however these fdfs vary less with flood duration moreover they were established by using the survey data in bago township for the 2014 flood only better correlation between hazards and damage depends on flood characteristics and damage data for various flood scales in wider areas therefore further improvement in the development of fdfs is necessary to assess flood damage in the study area more efforts should be made to improve the fdfs including the collection of flood damage data for the validation of fdfs okada et al 2011 in this study flood damage refers to the negative impact of flood on exposed elements brémond et al 2013 according to brémond et al 2013 flood damage to agriculture can be categorized as direct damage damage due to direct flood exposure and indirect damage damage not directly due to flood exposure direct and indirect damage can be further categorized as instantaneous damage occurs during or immediately after the flood event and induced damage occurs later in time not immediately after flooding brémond et al 2013 the flood damage to rice crops considered in this study is direct instantaneous damage e g crop yield reduction due to flooding and rice crop damage is monetized on the basis of crop yield reduction our primary goal in this study is to improve the fdfs developed by win et al 2018 for assessing flood damage to rice crops by collecting flood damage data through individual household surveys this study consists of mainly two parts i questionnaire survey and development of new fdfs for rice crops by improving the fdfs presented in win et al 2018 and ii application and validation of developed fdfs we considered one of the most flood prone river basins in myanmar the bago river basin for study to develop fdfs we conducted detailed surveys using questionnaires in the flood prone areas from the upstream to the downstream parts of the study area and collected the flood hazards and damage data for various flood events by using data collected from the survey we developed new fdfs for the quantitative estimation of rice production losses since expert based knowledge was often used to develop fdfs for agricultural crops in previous studies hussain 1995 molinari et al 2019 scorzini et al 2021 expert based information was also considered to determine the threshold criteria of minimum damageable flood depth the fdfs for rice crops were defined as functions of flood depth and flood duration and were developed for different growth stages of the rice plant to assess flood damage to rice crops we presented a grid based distributed method that integrates the hydrologic hydraulic model and the developed fdfs flood damage to the rice crop for study area was assessed for the recent severe flood events and the calculated damage was compared with reported data for validation of the fdfs to demonstrate the applicability of the developed fdfs in other areas we also assessed flood damage to rice crops by applying developed fdfs in five selected river basins in five other asian countries the fdfs presented in this study enable us to quantitatively estimate the rice yield loss and the expected loss in monetary value for different growth stages of rice crops this can help in better management of flood risk in the future 2 the study area fig 1 shows the location of the bago river basin which is located in the bago region of myanmar the study area lies mainly in the three townships of bago district bago thanatpin and kawa townships the study basin catchment covers an area of 5280 km2 and the main river is approximately 331 km long zin et al 2015 the elevation in the upstream part of the basin ranges from 50 to 750 m while the downstream part is almost flat with an elevation below 10 m as shown in fig 1 the average annual rainfall at bago station is approximately 3300 mm zin et al 2015 fig 2 shows the annual maximum 4 day basin average rainfall and annual peak discharge at the bago station during recent years the maximum 4 day basin average rainfall during a recent severe flood event in 2018 was 310 mm approximately 18 year return period shrestha and kawasaki 2020 the flood peak during the 2018 flood was about 1247 m3 s in the bago river basin recent flood events in 2011 2014 2018 and 2019 caused serious damage to many paddy fields and houses win et al 2020 more than 40 000 ha of paddy fields were severely affected during these flood events 3 methodology for development of flood damage functions and validation 3 1 questionnaire survey and development of flood damage functions for rice crops 3 1 1 survey outline damage data from past flood events are important for the development of fdfs however such data are not readily available in many developing countries including the study area to fill the gap in available data field investigations and surveys were conducted in the flood prone areas of the bago river basin from october 22 to november 3 2019 a questionnaire was created and approved by the research ethics committee of the university of tokyo tokyo japan it was distributed to the individual households during the survey period the questionnaire was designed to collect three categories of information on agricultural production and damage i general information related to rice production ii data related to flood hazard and iii data related to rice crop damage information was collected on agricultural land and rice crop production including maximum height of rice plants the method of rice cultivation types of rice grown rice crop transplanting and harvesting times time from planting to harvesting and cropping patterns flood characteristics in the paddy field were collected which included the start date of flooding flood depth and duration in the paddy field finally agricultural crop losses and damage were collected which included the height of rice plants during flooding the number of days from rice planting to flooding the planted areas of rice crops inundated rice paddy fields expected rice yield from the inundated paddy field if not flooded actual rice yield from the inundated paddy field after flooding and total yield loss of the rice crop due to flooding in addition flood depth and duration in the yard of house of respondent were also collected with use of available flood maps from past years and simulation results of flood hazards frequent flood prone areas were identified in the bago thanatpin and kawa townships and flood prone villages were selected for the survey fig 1 the surveys were conducted by randomly selecting households the required survey sample size for the questionnaire on agricultural damage was 162 based on 844 000 population and with a desired confidence level of 90 and relative margin of 6 5 a total of 340 households were interviewed out of which 174 households were farmers whose paddy fields were inundated during recent floods which is higher than target sample size the households located in the main bago city or nearby areas do not have paddy fields they had flood damage to their residential buildings and assets only the combined area of paddy fields owned by the 174 farmers was about 552 ha in year 2019 the flood hazard and damage information were collected for recent years such as flood events in 2018 and 2019 and the past severe flood event in 2011 3 1 2 establishment of flood damage functions using survey data fdfs which show a relation between hazard and damage are important components in flood damage estimation and they provide the monetary value of flood damage or the percentage of damage accounting for the total value of the exposed elements nguyen et al 2017 fdfs can be developed by using empirical or synthetic approaches messner et al 2007 merz et al 2010 the empirical approaches use actual flood damage data and hazard information collected after flood events while synthetic approaches use flood damage data collected via what if questions or expert estimations messner et al 2007 merz et al 2010 in both these approaches fdfs are generally developed by relating flood characteristics such as flood inundation depth duration and velocity with the resultant damage messner et al 2007 förster et al 2008 merz et al 2010 pistrika 2010 brémond et al 2013 shrestha et al 2018 in this study fdfs for agricultural crops rice crops were developed based on an empirical approach using damage data from past floods collected through questionnaires because maximum flood depth and duration can be easily obtained through surveys in the regions this study considered maximum flood depth and duration as the main factors causing flood damage to rice crops in addition the growth stage of the rice crop was also considered in the development of fdfs fig 3 shows the growth stages of the rice crop and the length of time the rice plant stays in each growth stage based on information presented in previous researches international rice research institute irri 2007 bureau of agricultural statistics bas 2013 the growth stages of the rice crop can be classified as a vegetative stage a reproductive stage a maturity stage and a ripening stage harvesting phase international rice research institute irri 2007 prathumchai et al 2018 bureau of agricultural statistics bas 2013 we measured flood damage to rice crops in terms of yield loss which we defined as reduction in yield as a percentage resulting from the occurrence of the flood disaster the yield loss due to flooding was calculated using survey data as follows 1 y i e l d l o s s 1 r i c e y i e l d f r o m t h e i n u n d a t e d p a d d y a r e

collected directly from the respondents during the surveys for cross validation of the yield loss calculated using eq 1 the collected information from the household surveys was also cross checked with village leaders and local staff of the irrigation and water utilization management department iwumd of myanmar to establish fdfs for the rice crop depth duration damage functions were used to calculate the percentage of yield loss of rice production expert based or synthetic based fdfs are usually developed in discrete form because detailed data are readily unavailable in many countries to develop damage curves or continuous functions hussain 1995 nguyen et al 2021 whereas empirical based fdfs are generally developed in the form of damage curves or continuous functions mekong river commission secretariat mrcs 2010 kwak et al 2015 shrestha et al 2016a nguyen et al 2017 win et al 2020 some previous studies already tested and applied linear relationships between crop yield reduction and flood parameters mekong river commission secretariat mrcs 2010 shrestha et al 2016a kwak et al 2015 molinari et al 2019 scorzini et al 2021 and found them reasonably applicable for practical use the present study also assumed a linear relationship between them and a multiple linear regression model was used to analyze flood damage to rice crops and its factors the yield loss was the dependent variable and the flood depth and duration were the independent variables of the multiple linear regression model the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables was obtained using the data collected from the questionnaire the parameter values of the relationships were optimized using the least square method 3 2 application and validation of flood damage functions for validation the fdfs developed in this study were applied in the study area bago river basin and also in river basins in other asian countries such as the pampanga river basin prb philippines solo river basin srb indonesia chao phraya river basin cprb thailand lower mekong river basin lmrb cambodia and lower indus river basin lirb pakistan 3 2 1 application and validation in study area bago river basin 3 2 1 1 analysis of flood hazard the analysis of flood hazard characteristics is important for flood damage assessment to assess the hazard rainfall runoff processes and flood inundation were simulated using a hydrologic hydraulic model named rainfall runoff inundation rri model developed by sayama et al 2012 among other hydrologic hydraulic models the rri model is a two dimensional diffusive wave model capable of simulating rainfall runoff and flood inundation processes simultaneously the details on rri model can be found in sayama et al 2012 and sayama 2014 a digital elevation model dem for the study area developed by bhagabati et al 2020 was used for flood hazard simulation the dem with 450 m 15 arcseconds horizontal resolution was used in the rri model simulation the precipitation and water level data were collected from the department of meteorology and hydrology of myanmar the rri model was simulated using ground observed precipitation data to calculate flood characteristics the spatial distribution of rainfall was calculated based on the thiessen polygon interpolation method using precipitation data at bago zaung tu tharwady and kabaaye gauging stations sayama 2014 the observed outflow discharge at the zaung tu dam collected from the department of hydropower implementation of myanmar was also given as an input boundary condition the lateral subsurface flow in mountainous areas was computed based on darcy s law while the green ampt infiltration model was used to calculate the vertical infiltration through the soil layers in the low lying areas the global land cover by national mapping organizations glcnmo version 3 2013 which was developed by the secretariat of the international steering committee for global mapping iscgm kobayashi et al 2017 and the digital soil map developed by the food and agriculture organization were used to define initial parameters of the rri model on the basis of the availability of hydrometeorological or damage data recent flood events in 2014 2018 and 2019 were selected to calibrate and validate the parameters of the rri model the initial parameters of the rri model were fine tuned during the calibration process by comparing the calculated discharge with that observed at the bago station for the 2014 flood event the calibrated parameters were validated by comparing the calculated and observed discharges at the bago station the calculated flood depth duration and inundation areas were also compared with the observed data 3 2 1 2 exposure cropland the cropland areas paddy fields in the study area were defined using available global land cover map glcnmo version 3 2013 developed by the iscgm the spatial resolution of the land cover map is 15 arcseconds fig 4 shows the cropland of the study area the cropland areas were visually checked with google earth images the reliability of the areas was verified by importing the keyhole markup language kml files of the cropland areas into google earth the cropland areas were found to match google earth images the total cropland area in the study area is approximately 2134 km2 which covers approximately 40 of the entire study area 3 2 1 3 flood damage estimation the grid based distributed damage estimation model which integrates the flood hazard the exposed items and the damage functions was developed using the fortran programming language by using developed damage functions according to flood depth and duration flood damage to the rice crop can be estimated in monetary value using following equation 2 v o l u m e l o s s o f r i c e p r o d u c t i o n k g y i e l d l o s s 100 r i c e y i e l d k g p e r h a d a m a g e d a r e a s h a 3 d a m a g e v a l u e d a m a g e c o s t v o l u m e l o s s o f r i c e p r o d u c t i o n k g f a r m g a t e p r i c e p e r k g to estimate rice crop damage the farmgate price and the rice yield data obtained from the questionnaires were used in the calculation to apply an appropriate fdf according to the growth stage of rice plants the growth stage of rice plants during a flood event was identified based on the cropping calendar and the number of days at each growing stage the cropping calendar for the study area was also established based on information and data collected through surveys since data on rice crop damage to the study area in the 2014 and 2018 floods were already provided by previous studies the flood damage to rice crops was estimated for these flood events by using the developed fdfs to validate these functions then the fdfs for the rice crop was validated by comparing the calculated results of damage with reported data for 2014 and 2018 flood events 3 2 2 application and validation in other areas to check the applicability of the fdfs in other areas we applied the fdfs developed in this study in the river basins of other countries flood damage to the rice crop was estimated using the developed fdfs in the prb srb cprb lmrb and lirb these river basins were selected for application of developed fdfs in other areas because flood hazard and damage data for these river basins have already been available in previous researches sayama et al 2012 2015 perera et al 2015 shrestha et al 2018 2019 in addition the recent floods caused severe damage to the rice crop in these areas the developed fdfs can be applicable to the selected river basins as similar types of rice crop are grown in south and southeast asian countries grisp 2013 shelley et al 2016 for the application of the fdfs to other areas the hazard simulation results of the rri model flood depth and duration which have been calibrated and validated in previous studies were obtained from previous works for the largest recent flood events for those areas prb and srb data from shrestha et al 2019 cprb data from sayama et al 2015 lmrb data from perera et al 2015 and lirb data from sayama et al 2012 the flood damage to rice crops for these river basins was estimated by applying the developed fdfs to severe past flood events the flood event in 2011 for prb cprb and lmrb the flood event in 2007 for srb and the flood event in 2010 for lirb table 1 the results of the rri model for these areas have already been validated by previous authors for the considered flood events by comparing calculated discharges and flood inundation extent areas with observed discharge and available flood maps a detailed explanation of the rri model calibration and validation for prb can be found in shrestha et al 2016a 2019 for srb in kudo et al 2016 and shrestha et al 2016b 2019 for cprb in sayama et al 2015 for lmrb in perera et al 2015 and shrestha et al 2019 and for lirb in sayama et al 2012 table 1 the damage estimation conditions such as paddy field rice yield farmgate prices and growth stages of the rice crop during the flood event were the same as those reported in shrestha et al 2018 2019 flood damage was estimated by applying appropriate fdfs based on the growth stage of the rice crop during flooding based on the growth stage of the rice crop and the rice cropping pattern rice crops in prb cprb lmrb and lirb were at the maturity stage during the target flood event shrestha et al 2018 2019 by contrast the rice crop was at the vegetative and maturity stages in the downstream and upstream parts of srb respectively shrestha et al 2016b the estimated values of rice crop damage using the developed fdfs were compared with the reported data the estimated value of rice crop in the case of the prb were compared with the reported data at the municipality level because the reported data were available at the municipality level for this basin however the basin level data were compared for the other river basins 4 results 4 1 survey results based on the information collected from the questionnaires the representative cropping calendar and patterns in the region were formulated as shown in fig 5 they usually cultivate rice paddies during the monsoon period from june to early november no other major crops are cultivated in these areas during that time period during the winter and summer periods rice paddy summer paddy and other crops beans green peas and peanuts are cultivated from late october to march for rice crop planting during the monsoon season seeding and preparing seedbeds are usually done in june the farmers transplant the rice seedlings from mid june to early july the rice paddies in the study area are harvested from october to early november table 2 shows the summary statistics of data on rice cultivation and production collected from the survey based on survey data the average time from seeding or seedbed to harvesting stages of the rice crop is about 134 days which is similar to the duration of rice crop cultivation presented in fig 3 according to the questionnaire responses the maximum heights of the rice crops were mostly 100 130 cm which was also confirmed via measurement in several paddy fields the measured heights of the rice crops ranged from 110 cm to 130 cm the spatial average value of the rice yield from different paddy fields in the areas based on survey data was about 2958 kg per ha the farmer s rice paddy selling price was about 216 kyats per kg on average spatial average the average cost of input value for rice cultivation was about 383 425 kyats per ha the survey data in detail are presented in supplementary material fig 6 shows the frequency distributions of flood depth and duration in the paddy fields of surveyed data for the 2011 2018 and 2019 flood events flood depth in the paddy fields was often under 3 m however some farmers also experienced flood depths greater than 3 m in their paddy fields during the 2011 and 2018 floods the figure also shows that many of the farmers interviewed recorded flood durations longer than 20 days in their paddy fields during the 2011 2018 and 2019 flood events 4 2 establishment of flood damage functions fdf for rice crop varies with each growing stage in the study area flooding mainly occurs during the vegetative reproductive and maturity stages of the crop and fdfs were thus developed for these stages from the surveys of this study and previous studies win et al 2018 2020 it was observed that there was no rice crop damage found in the areas during the ripening stage harvesting phase because at this stage occurs during the end of the monsoon season in the current study expert based knowledge was also considered to determine the values of threshold criteria such as minimum damageable flood depth and flooding submergence tolerance duration flood water can be beneficial to rice plants at a certain flood depth and duration mekong river commission secretariat mrcs 2010 according to information collected from discussion with local experts of the iwumd together with some farmers flood damage to the rice crop occurs in the study areas if the flood depth is over 0 4 0 5 m and the duration is longer than 3 4 days similar values were also adopted by previous researcher for bago river basin win et al 2020 the damage curves developed by win et al 2020 show that rice crop damage occurs if flood depth is higher than 0 4 m in the vegetative and reproductive stages the curves also show that no damage occurs if flood duration is less than 3 days based on information collected from local experts and farmers and referring to previous researches hussain 1995 mekong river commission secretariat mrcs 2010 kwak et al 2015 shrestha et al 2016a win et al 2020 this study assumed that rice crop damage occurs if the flood depth is higher than 0 4 m in the vegetative stage and higher than 0 5 m in the reproductive and maturity stages this is considered the minimum damageable flood depth it was also assumed that damage occurs if flood duration is greater than 3 days referring to previous literature win et al 2018 2020 and expert based information collected from the discussion with local experts together with some farmers rice crops in the study area are completely damaged by the flood when the rice crop is fully submerged in flood for longer than 3 weeks if the water level reaches over the height of the rice plants it is considered to be complete crop submergence when the rice crop was completely submerged the yield loss was assumed to be the same as that at the starting level of complete submergence slcs the flood damage mechanism considering temporal changes in the height of rice plants in each growth stage is complex and the understanding of the mechanism requires more detailed research and data therefore for simplicity this study used the maximum height of rice plants in each growth stage previous researchers also usually used the maximum height of rice plants in the development of fdfs mekong river commission secretariat mrcs 2010 kwak et al 2015 shrestha et al 2016a win et al 2020 by referring to fig 3 and previous researches mekong river commission secretariat mrcs 2010 kwak et al 2015 shrestha et al 2016a win et al 2020 this study assumed that the slcs is 1 0 m for the vegetative stage and 1 3 m for the reproductive and maturity stages by using data collected from the survey questionnaires and above assumption of minimum damageable flood depth the fdfs for the rice crop was developed for the vegetative reproductive and maturity stages as follows 4 y i e l d l o s s h f l o o d h m i n a b d f l o o d i f h f l o o d s l c s h f l o o d f l o o d d e p t h a t s l c s i f y i e l d l o s s 0 y i e l d l o s s 0 i f y i e l d l o s s 100 y i e l d l o s s 100 where h f l o o d is the flood inundation depth in m h m i n is the minimum damageable flood depth in m d f l o o d is the flood duration in days and a and b are constant parameters that vary depending on growth stages the values of the parameters for each growth stage are presented in table 3 the values of r2 and adjusted r2 of the regression analysis were 0 835 and 0 829 for the vegetative stage 0 854 and 0 847 for the reproductive stage and 0 834 and 0 813 for the maturity stage the model performance of the regression analysis was found to be good for all the growth stages the significance f value was less than 0 01 for all growth stages which indicated that the dependent and independent variables were statistically significant table 4 shows the descriptive statistics of each variable term of regression the p values for the variable terms of regression were less than 0 01 for all growth stages which indicated that the variables were statistically significant predictors the equation of fdfs developed in this study eq 4 can estimate flood damage at any given flood depth and duration for different growth stages of the rice crops by using the equation for damage functions flood damage curves are derived as presented in fig 7 the shape of the damage curves developed in this study is similar to that presented by mrcs 2010 kwak et al 2015 and shrestha et al 2016a when the rice crop is completely submerged rice crop is completely damaged 100 if the flood duration is 27 days or longer in vegetative and reproductive stages and 24 days or longer in the maturity which are similar to fdfs presented in win et al 2020 win et al 2020 fdfs showed that rice crops are completely damaged by the flood when completely submerged for a duration of 25 days or longer the damage curves developed in the present study showed that when the rice crop was completely submerged more than 50 damage can occur within 8 days of flooding at all growth stages this finding is similar to the yield loss value obtained from the damage curves presented by the mrcs 2010 and kwak et al 2015 60 damage can occur within 8 days of flooding however the damage curves presented by hussain 1995 showed that more than 60 damage can occur within 3 days of flooding in vegetative and reproductive stages and more than 40 in the maturity stage the damage curves presented by shrestha et al 2016a further showed that more than 50 damage can occur within 3 days of flooding for completely submerged rice crop at reproductive and maturity stages the slope of the damage curves developed in this study at the vegetative stage is steeper than that at reproductive or maturity stages flooding for a duration of 8 days and at a depth of 1 0 m can cause 50 40 and 36 rice crop damage in the vegetative reproductive and maturity stages the yield loss for the vegetative stage was the most severe which initiated complete damage during the 27 day flood duration with a flood depth of 1 0 m since the height of rice plants during the vegetative stage is shorter than that during the reproductive or maturity stages larger paddy field areas are affected by flood during the vegetative stage reddy and mittra 1985a 1985b win et al 2018 nguyen et al 2021 also pointed out that the effects of submergence on rice yield at the vegetative stage are more severe compared with those at the reproductive stage because the height of rice plants during the vegetative stage is shorter than during the other growth stages therefore the flood damage can be expected to be more severe at the early stage than the later growth stage moreover the developed damage curves show that the yield loss during complete submergence of rice plants at a duration of less than 16 days in the maturity stage is lower than that of the reproductive stage but is higher for a longer flood duration which was possibly due to the occurrence of more damage in the maturity stage of rice crops when the flood duration of complete submergence was prolonged bureau of agricultural statistics bas 2013 similar characteristics of damage at each growth stage of the rice plants were also found in fdfs developed by some previous researchers hussain 1995 bureau of agricultural statistics bas 2013 shrestha et al 2016a however some other researchers reddy and mittra 1985a zhang et al 2015 nguyen et al 2021 reported that rice crops are the most vulnerable to flood inundation during the ripening stage and are more robust in the reproductive stage the duration of rice crop cultivation in the study area was 134 days from seeding seedbed to harvesting stages however characteristic damage in cases of early maturity rice crops varieties characterized by cultivation time as short as 90 100 days may differ from that of rice in the study area kotera et al 2005 the plant heights for different growth stages of the rice crops considered by zhang et al 2015 and nguyen et al 2021 are shorter than those of the rice in the study area and reddy and mittra 1985a and zhang et al 2015 focused on yield loss under artificial flooding with clear tap water these factors may also explain different characteristics of rice crop damage the sensitivity of submergence tolerance of rice crops also depends on plant height of the rice crop kotera and nawata 2007 and rice crop damage characteristics caused by clear water may differ from that by muddy water zhang et al 2015 table 5 compares the considered variables and other factors in developed fdfs in this study with fdfs in previous researches the table also compares the minimum damageable flood depth adopted in this study with those in previous studies the depth duration damage fdfs developed in this study which is the continuous damage functions allow us to estimate flood damage at any given flood depth and duration for different growth stages of rice crop in the present study the flooding tolerance of rice plants in complete submergence for each growth stage of the rice plant and the thresholds of minimum damageable flood depth were also adequately considered when developing the fdfs 4 3 application and validation of fdfs 4 3 1 application and validation in bago river basin 4 3 1 1 results of flood hazard analysis fig 8 a c compares calculated discharges with observed discharges at the bago station for 2014 2018 and 2019 flood events the 2014 flood event was used for the calibration of the values of rri model parameters the calibrated parameters of the rri model were validated with the 2018 and 2019 floods the results show that the calculated discharges from the model agreed well with the observed discharges indicating high nash sutcliff coefficient of efficiency nsce and r2 coefficient of determination values the nsce and r2 values were 0 84 and 0 89 for the 2014 flood 0 69 and 0 76 for the 2018 flood and 0 71 and 0 82 for the 2019 flood the percent bias p bias was also found to be good for all the flood event cases p bias 9 3 for 2014 11 9 for 2018 and 24 for 2019 fig 9 compares calculated maximum flood inundation depth with measured flood depth marks collected from the field survey for 2018 and 2019 floods and fig 10 shows scatterplots of calculated flood depths versus measured flood depths for the 2018 flood the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and mean absolute percentage error mape between the measured and calculated flood depths were 0 49 m 0 43 m and 42 respectively and for the 2019 flood they were 0 38 m 0 39 m and 30 respectively there were minor discrepancies between measured and calculated flood depths but mape values indicated that the discrepancies between measured and calculated flood depths were reasonably acceptable mape values between 20 50 are generally acceptable moreno et al 2013 in addition the p bias values 16 for 2018 flood 19 for 2019 flood between the measured and calculated flood depths for 2018 and 2019 flood events also indicated reasonably acceptable performance of the rri model moriasi et al 2007 fig 11 compares the calculated flood extent areas of the 2018 flood event with probable flood extent based on available advanced land observing satellite alos 2 sentinel asia imagery for whole areas in the lower part of the basin as derived by san et al 2020 the results show that calculated flood extent areas are similar to possible flood extent areas interpreted from satellite imagery although some underestimation or overestimation in calculated flood extent areas was found in some locations the estimated and observed flood inundation areas for the 2018 flood were 973 and 938 km2 respectively the overlap area between estimated and observed inundation areas was 701 km2 the fit and correctness indices bates and de roo 2000 liu et al 2019 between the observed and estimated flood inundation areas for the 2018 flood were 58 and 75 respectively for whole areas in the lower part of the basin the rmse and mape values between the observed and estimated flood inundation areas were 34 km2 and 3 6 respectively overall the estimated flood inundation area for the 2018 flood was in reasonable agreement with the observed inundation area fig 12 compares calculated flood duration with the flood duration data collected through the survey questionnaires for the 2018 and 2019 flood events and fig 13 shows scatterplots of measured versus calculated flood durations the rmse mae mape and p bias values between measured and calculated flood duration for the 2018 flood were 9 days 7 days 37 and 26 respectively and for the 2019 flood they were 8 days 6 days 39 and 10 respectively the rmse and mae values for flood duration also indicated some discrepancies between measured and calculated values but overall the mape and p bias values supported reasonable agreement between measured and calculated flood durations some of the discrepancy between the observed and calculated flood depths or durations or inundation areas can be attributed to various reasons the calculated flood depth and duration were average values over the grid but the measured flood depth and duration were for a specific location which may vary due to local topographical undulation the main reason for underestimation or overestimation of calculated flood inundation areas was that the satellite imagery based flood extent analysis may interpret irrigation water ponding in a paddy field as flooded areas sayama et al 2015 shrestha et al 2019 also such analysis may not correctly detect flooded residential areas owing to double bounce scattering and shadow effects and may also misinterpret areas of vegetation zhao 2016 venama et al 2021 discrepancies between observed and calculated flood depths or durations or inundation areas can also arise from the accuracy of the topographical data used in the rri model simulation from the selection of a spatial scale such as grid size used in the rri model simulation and from the temporal resolution of input data such as hourly or daily rainfall data in addition the river width and depth at each river grid cell were approximated using empirical relationships in the rri model and such calculation may have influenced the results of the hazard analysis furthermore the initial conditions in the rri model before flooding and the validity of calibrated parameters may have influenced the agreement between observed and simulated results 4 3 1 2 validation of fdfs by using developed fdfs flood damage to the rice crop was estimated for 2014 and 2018 floods since fdfs were developed based on maximum flood inundation depth flood damage to rice crop was estimated using calculated maximum flood inundation depth the crop growing season during both of these flood events was in the monsoon season based on the number of days the rice plant spends in each growth stage fig 3 and the cropping calendar fig 5 the growth stages during the 2014 and 2018 floods were the reproductive stages the damage functions for the reproductive stage for both flood events were thus applied to estimate flood damage during those flood events in myanmar the reported data on agricultural damage are only available in terms of damaged paddy area therefore the calculated results of damaged paddy field areas were compared with reported damaged paddy areas for bago thanatpin and kawa townships for the validation of damage assessment table 6 compares the calculated results of the damaged paddy field area with reported data for the 2014 and 2018 floods the rmse and mape between reported and calculated damaged paddy field areas for 2014 flood were 2349 ha and 11 while they were about 5496 ha and 13 in the case of 2018 flood the results show that the calculated results of the damage paddy field areas agreed reasonably with the reported data with low rmse and mape values from this comparison we can confirm at least introduced threshold criteria for damage occurrence such as minimum damageable flood depth and also estimated damaged paddy area the validation of developed flood damage assessment method in terms of degree of damage or estimated damage in monetary value is discussed in sub section 4 3 2 for other river basins in asia 4 3 2 application and validation of fdfs in other areas for validation of flood hazard in other areas detailed data are unavailable to quantitatively validate calculated flood inundation results with observed data the available data on flood inundation for the prb include a flood mark map and average flood depth data for some villages however only satellite based observed flood maps are available for other basins which makes it possible only to visually compare the calculated flood extent areas with observed flood extent areas except for prb figs 14 and 15 compare the calculated flood extent areas with observed data for considered river basins observed flood maps are also presented in supplementary material overall the calculated flood extent areas reasonably agree with the observed flood extent areas in all the river basins fig s6 see supplementary material compares the calculated flood depth with the recorded flood depth for the areas located in prb for prb the rmse 0 04 m mape 19 and the p bias 3 values indicated that the calculated results of flood depth were in good agreement with the recorded flood depth fig 16 shows the calculated flood durations during the considered flood events for the selected basins the average flood inundation depth in all river basins was higher than 1 m during the target flood event primarily in the range of 1 2 m however the flood duration in each basin varied widely because of basin characteristics furthermore the flood duration ranged 1 2 weeks in prb and srb primarily and 3 4 weeks in lirb the flood duration in cprb and lmrb was longer than 2 months table 7 shows the comparison of estimated values of rice crop damage using developed fdfs with the reported value the results show that the flood yield loss was also well explained for the areas with durations of 1 2 weeks to more than 1 month the rmse and mape values are also shown in the table overall the estimated values of rice crop damage agreed reasonably with the reported values however the mape value was found relatively higher in some municipalities of prb 20 but within reasonably acceptable range the comparison results show that the fdfs developed in this study can be used in other areas in southeast asian and south asian countries where the rice crop styles and major types of cultivated rice are similar to those in the study area as scorzini et al 2021 pointed out previous researchers usually applied existing fdfs developed for other areas by just adjusting the values of farmgate prices and crop yield without any other adjustments in the assumptions made in the development of the fdfs because of limited available information on their development however some adjustments of the assumptions behind the fdfs might be necessary when those developed for a specific area are applied to estimate damage in other areas therefore when the fdfs developed in this study are used in other areas it is recommended to carefully check input data required for damage estimation based on local characteristics and also to validate estimated damage with reported data to confirm the reliability of estimated damage scorzini et al 2021 if necessary it is also recommended to adjust assumptions made for fdfs such as the minimum damageable flood depth and the height of rice plants as pointed out by scorzini et al 2021 also note that the developed fdfs can be used for any height of rice plants both flood tolerant and flood intolerant rice varieties by adjusting the height of rice plants and the minimum damageable flood depth 5 discussions in this study we developed fdfs for rice crops by improving the fdfs presented by win et al 2018 and validated the developed fdfs for the bago river basin of myanmar and also in other areas the key flood parameters considered in the development of fdfs are flood depth flood duration and growth stage of rice however various other parameters such as flow velocity and sediment concentration may influence flood damage to rice crops brémond et al 2013 brémond et al 2013 stated that flow velocity should be considered if most of the local flooding events are flash floods in the bago river basin most of the paddy areas are in low lying areas and flooding occurs mainly due to fluvial flooding or pluvial flooding i e the effect of flow velocity might be small nonetheless in some areas at the upper part of the basin where the land slope is relatively steeper and close to the riverbank it was observed during the survey that rice crop damage was severe even in short flood durations compared to rice crop damage in low land areas which was possibly due to a higher flow velocity we validated the developed fdfs by comparing the calculated results of the flood damage to the reported rice crops in the bago river basin and other areas we found that the calculated results agreed reasonably with the reported data however some discrepancies obtained between measured and calculated results of flood depth duration and inundation areas in the study area may have had some influence on the validation of the fdfs and further validation of the fdfs might be necessary for confirming the reliability of estimated damage when the developed fdfs is applied to assess flood damage and risk moreover mape value was higher than 20 in some municipalities of prb the reliability of damage estimation depends on not only the fdfs but also various other factors such as the quality of survey data methodology of counting reported damage data in the field and accuracy of the topographical and exposure data used in the assessment moreover the selection of the spatial e g grid or river basin scale and temporal e g daily or weekly or monthly scales and the input data type e g vector or raster data are crucial in maintaining the reliability of damage assessment results merz et al 2010 brémond et al 2013 shrestha and kawasaki 2020 in addition approximation of the river width and depth using empirical relationships the initial conditions in the rri model and also validity of calibrated parameters may have influenced the results of hazard analysis and damage estimation for the study area we also attempted to validate the calculated flood depth and duration with those obtained through the survey however the flood hazard results for areas from other countries were validated only by comparing the discharge and flood inundation extent with the observed data because of lack of observed flood depth and duration data in those areas the major rice type considered in this study for the development of fdfs was rain fed paddy whose maximum plant height is about 130 cm however the maximum plant heights of some other rice varieties such as deep water paddy might be higher than 130 cm and some adjustment of maximum plant heights and minimum damageable flood depth may be necessary to apply in other areas therefore this point should be noted when applying the fdfs developed in this study to other areas moreover the flood damage to rice crops was expressed as regards yield loss and rice crop damage was monetized on the basis of crop yield reduction however a comprehensive assessment of flood damage to agriculture sector requires complex analysis also involving assessment of the changes in production costs due to the flood loss of beneficial soils loss of paddy fields and damage to the standing farm equipment molinari et al 2019 scorzini et al 2021 the fdfs developed in this study can be applied to assess flood damage to rice crop and to evaluate effectiveness of flood preventive measures in order to reduce rice crop damage preventive measures and land use plans must be developed and implemented in the area these include establishment of flood protection measures and adequate drainage capacity and the use of submergence tolerant rice varieties in flood prone areas during the monsoon season 6 conclusions in this study we aimed to improve the fdfs presented by win et al 2018 for rice crops by collecting data on past flood hazards and damage through individual household surveys by distributing questionnaires in the flood prone areas of the study basin by using data collected through the survey we developed new fdfs for rice crops for the assessment of flood damage to rice crops for the bago river basin and also evaluated its applicability to other areas in asia the fdfs developed for the study areas were validated by comparing calculated damage with reported data the fdfs presented in this study enabled us to obtain a relationship between the flood hazards and the direct economic loss of rice crop damage the important flood parameters considered in the development of fdfs for rice crops are flood depth and duration in addition to flood parameters rice crop flood damage is also dependent on the growth stage of the rice crop the fdfs for different growth stages of rice crop are presented in this study and according to the rice crop growth stage during the flood event appropriate fdfs can be applied to estimate monetary value of rice crop damage the estimated results of flood damage to the rice crop using the developed fdfs for the study area and the applied river basins of other countries agreed reasonably with the reported data the fdfs presented in this study enable us to quantitatively estimate the losses in rice production and the expected monetary value of rice crop losses due to floods for different growth stages of the rice crops that can help better manage flood risk in the future the fdfs presented in this study can also be applied to assessing flood damage to rice crops in other areas where rice crop styles and the major types of rice grown are similar specifically in southeast asian and south asian countries in this study we have validated the applicability of the developed fdfs in the river basin of five countries in asia however further validation is also recommended to apply the fdfs presented in this study to other asian countries or countries outside asia in addition since the proposed fdfs were validated for large flood events further validation is necessary to check the applicability of the fdfs to small scale flood events credit authorship contribution statement badri bhakta shrestha

8208,study region mekong river basin and surrounding areas study focus this study investigated the impacts of climate change on future meteorological and hydrological droughts in the mekong river basin and its surrounding areas our work is based on the output of five global climate models gcms and simulations using the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm for the historical 1975 2004 near future 2010 2039 middle future 2040 2069 and far future 2070 2099 periods the meteorological droughts in the study area were measured using spi and spei while the hydrological droughts were measured using ssi new hydrological insights for the region the results suggest that droughts will generally reduce in the future over most of the study area but will be more unevenly distributed with an eastward migration as compared to the historical period both meteorological and hydrological droughts will intensify in the near future but will then reduce in intensity meteorological droughts will increase in the northeastern areas in the near future followed by migration towards the south hydrological droughts showed similar aggravation followed by reduction with upstream areas showing greater variability in the general context of drought alleviation southwestern china and the mekong river estuary may suffer from a continuously increasing drought intensity in the future this finding is based on 100 year extreme drought events keywords drought spi spei ssi mekong river basin climate change 1 introduction drought is an unpredictable climatic event that can be extremely destructive to the economy society and the natural environment currently though drought detection and monitoring technologies have greatly improved drought characteristics are still unclear wilhite 2000 drought is generally divided into three types 1 meteorological drought which usually originates from a lack of precipitation 2 hydrological drought mainly caused by a deficiency of streamflow and water storage and 3 agricultural drought a combination of the former two droughts caused by the reduction in soil moisture storage dai 2011 mishra and singh 2010 sheffield et al 2004 van loon 2015 various drought indices have been developed to investigate droughts in detail the palmer drought severity index pdsi wayne 1965 is the first comprehensive index to assess moisture status on spatial and temporal scales and is widely used globally chou et al 2013 diaz 1983 mu et al 2013 sheffield et al 2004 the standardized precipitation index spi an index widely used in the detection of meteorological drought and precipitation abnormalities was proposed in 1993 huang et al 2016 mckee et al 1993 however as spi is a single scalar index that corresponds only to precipitation the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and standardized streamflow index ssi vicente serrano et al 2011 were proposed to evaluate meteorological including the role of temperature and hydrological droughts at 1 month to 48 month scales spei is related to both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration temperature and has the advantage of combining multi scale characters with the ability to include the impact of temperature in drought assessment vicente serrano et al 2010 several studies have highlighted that as global warming continues increasing temperature and changing precipitation patterns will have direct effects on drought events leading to an uneven distribution across spatial and temporal scales dai 2013 hao and singh 2015 sheffield and wood 2007 although numerous studies have been conducted to assess future drought conditions under various climate change scenarios the results vary geographically generally the total drought events are expected to decrease globally but extreme droughts would increase regionally dubrovský et al 2014 lutz et al 2014 sheffield and wood 2007 wan et al 2018 wang et al 2014 zhao and dai 2016 under a changing environment drought is not a purely natural hazard as humans have altered the characteristics of droughts by changing their coping mechanisms tang 2020 van loon et al 2016 climate change and human activities are considered to have both direct and indirect impacts on drought events the direct impacts occur due to irrigation snowmelt and reservoir operation whereas the indirect impacts correspond to landscape change deforestation and population growth he et al 2017 guo et al 2017 qiu 2010 the mekong river is the most important transboundary river in asia and plays a critical role in agricultural production and water resource sustainability in its surrounding areas previous studies have suggested that the mekong river basin mrb suffered several extreme droughts in the last two decades and will encounter more severe and intense droughts in the future which has caused and will cause extensive economic losses and threat to human survival nguyen and shaw 2011 son et al 2012 thilakarathne and sridhar 2017 however research conducted in this region has not examined the difference between the changes in meteorological and hydrological droughts based on historical data and there is a lack of quantitative assessments of future extreme meteorological droughts therefore the purpose of this study was to quantitatively investigate the characteristics of future droughts in the mrb and its adjacent regions under climate change scenarios from meteorological and hydrological aspects using global climate models gcms and the distribution hydrological model 2 study area this study focused on regions fig 1 around the mrb from 5 n to 35 n and from 90 e to 110 e including countries in the indo china peninsula myanmar lao pdr thailand cambodia and vietnam and several southwestern provinces in china sichuan yunnan guangxi tibet and guizhou several states of india assam nagaland meghalaya manipur tripura and mizoram and sylhet division of bangladesh a majority of the study areas is humid and precipitation in the study area is affected by the summer monsoon from may to september each year the mekong river is in the centre of the study area and rises in the tibetan plateau and flows through the yunnan province in china myanmar lao pdr thailand cambodia and vietnam and finally discharges into the south china sea the mekong river is one of the world s longest rivers with a length of 4909 km and the 21st largest river with a 795 000 km2 drainage area and 14 500 m3 s average annual discharge basin 2010 wang et al 2017 the topographies of the mrb are complex and have large spatial variability the upper mekong river in china is called the lancang river originating from the tibetan plateau with an altitude ranging from 6 000 500 m the upper mekong river basin umrb and its surrounding regions referred to as the northern part of the study area within china contain plateaus terraces hills valleys and mountains and its landcover types changed from grassland to a mix of cropland agroforestry and shrub from west to east the annual average precipitation of umrb is 962 3 mm which is concentrated in summer accounting for 55 of the total annual precipitation chen et al 2017 tang et al 2019 the umrb has an area of 170 000 km2 accounts for approximately 21 of the total mrb area and contributes only 15 of the total streamflow volume manivong and schindele 2004 the lower mekong river basin lmrb and its surrounding areas referred to as the southern part of the study area outside of china cover myanmar thailand vietnam and cambodia and parts of india the lmrb is covered with a large amount of forest and cropland the annual precipitation in the lmrb reaches 2000 mm which is twice that of the umrb therefore lmrb contributes 85 of the total streamflow volume manivong and schindele 2004 in contrast to the umrb lmrb has developed tributaries which produce approximately 4 million tons of fish and aquatic products every year providing important sources of protein and economic resources for local residents basin 2015 3 data and methodology 3 1 geomorphology based hydrological model in this study the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm was applied to simulate the future discharge of the mekong river the gbhm has been successfully used in several rivers worldwide to forecast floods and assess the impacts of climate change and landcover change cong et al 2009 gao et al 2008 li et al 2019 tang et al 2011 wang and wang 2006 wang et al 2016 2017 xu et al 2008 2013 yang et al 2004 the gbhm uses a digital elevation model dem to generate a digital basin for simulating discharge the model divides the entire basin into a number of flow intervals based on the distance from the outlet to the upper source it then generates the fundamental computational unit flow interval hillslope using area and width functions subsequently two dimensional water kinematics is simplified to a single dimension other hydrological processes including snowmelt canopy interception and evapotranspiration are calculated by a physical model for each hillslope and the discharge is calculated by a nonlinear numerical river routing scheme yang et al 2002 a gbhm with a 0 5 0 5 resolution and 49 sub basins was applied in this study the parameters and other auxiliary data of gbhm are shown in table 1 and the model setup and calibration follow previous studies on mrb wang et al 2016 2017 3 2 future climate projections the meteorological forcing data of gbhm were obtained from the bias corrected daily climate model outputs of five gcms hadgem2 es miroc esm chem gfdl esm2m noresm1 m and ipsl cm5a lr produced by the intersectoral impact model intercomparison project isi mip warszawski et al 2014 all five gcms contain two representative concentration pathways rcps rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 a comprehensive understanding of drought conditions for a region requires us to not only study historical and current droughts but also to understand future droughts mishra and singh 2010 therefore both the historical 1975 2004 and future 2010 2099 periods were included in this study the future period was divided into three 30 year periods for equal comparison near future 2010 2039 nf middle future 2040 2069 mf and far future 2070 2099 ff the five averaged gcm datasets were corrected for bias and statistically downscaled to 0 5 0 5 and daily time steps to meet the requirements of the hydrological model hempel et al 2013 3 3 reference data the gridded gauge analysis products of the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc were derived from quality controlled station data the product spans from 1891 to 2016 on regular latitude longitude grids at a 0 5 0 5 resolution rudolf et al 2005 schneider et al 2011 the 1975 2004 monthly precipitation of gpcc version full v2018 was used as reference data to assess the reliability and statistical representativeness of isimip for the historical period the discharge gauge observations from the mekong river commission mrc were used to validate the stability of the ssi based on the gbhm output all six discharge stations chiang saen luang prabang nong khai mukdahan pakse and stung treng are located downstream of the mekong river and have a relatively large and stable streamflow fig 1 it is worth mentioning that the lower sites contain accumulation information of the upper sub basins 3 4 drought indices spi spei and ssi to comprehensively investigate drought conditions spi spei and ssi were used to evaluate the meteorological drought spi and spei and hydrological drought ssi conditions under the spi the gamma probability distribution function was used to identify the historical drought conditions and then further normalise and standardise the parameters to obtain the historical spi spi evaluates drought conditions based on precipitation whereas spei evaluates drought based on the difference between precipitation and potential evaporation pet as the difference between precipitation and pet can be negative the log logistic distribution is used to calculate spei which has three parameters and can extend the lower boundary below 0 various options exist for the distribution of ssi such as normal pearson iii gamma general extreme value gev log logistic and lognormal which are all widely accepted distributions and have been used in different basins worldwide chen et al 2018 kang and jiang 2019 shamshirband et al 2020 telesca et al 2012 tijdeman et al 2020 vicente serrano et al 2011 wan et al 2018 although different basins have different suitable distributions gev is one of the most widely used distributions for ssi due to its high value description and flexibility chen et al 2018 kang and jiang 2019 tijdeman et al 2020 vicente serrano et al 2011 thus in this study the gev was adapted to fit the streamflow series and calculate the ssi future drought was calculated based on the historical rainfall distribution established earlier to maintain the consistency of the comparison and demonstrate the relative changes hasegawa et al 2016 huang et al 2016 the calculation function of the ssi and spi is shown below 1 s p i s s i s t c 2 t c 1 t c 0 d 3 t d 2 t d 1 t 1 0 where t l n 1 p x 2 p x is the probability density function of precipitation or discharge s is a coefficient of probability density when p x 0 5 s 1 when p x 0 5 s 1 x is the amount of monthly precipitation or discharge c0 c1 c2 d1 d2 and d3 are constants with values of 2 515517 0 802853 0 010328 1 432788 0 189269 and 0 001308 respectively angelidis et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2011 the probability density function for spi is defined as 2 p x 1 β α γ α x α 1 e x β where α 0 is the shape parameter β 0 is the scale parameter and γ α is the gamma function which is defined as 3 γ α 0 y α 1 e y d y the pet was estimated following the thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1948 vicente serrano et al 2010 the probability density function for spei is defined as 4a ƒ x β α x γ α β 1 1 x γ α β 2 where α β and γ are the scale shape and origin parameters respectively of the log logistic distribution and can be obtained as 4b β 2 ω 1 ω 0 6 ω 1 ω 0 6 ω 2 4c α ω 0 2 ω 1 β γ 1 1 β γ 1 1 β 4d γ ω 0 α γ 1 1 β γ 1 1 β where ω s can be calculated as 4e ω s 1 n i 1 n 1 f i s d i where d i is the difference in month i between precipitation and pet n is the number of data points and f i is a frequency estimator f i can be calculated as 4f f i i 0 35 n the probability density function for ssi is defined as 5a ƒ ξ μ σ x 1 σ 1 ξ x μ σ 1 1 ξ e x p 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ ξ 0 and 5b ƒ 0 μ σ x 1 σ e x μ σ exp e x μ σ ξ 0 where ξ is the tail shape parameter μ is the location parameter and σ is the scale parameter markose and alentorn 2011 a drought event is the sum of consecutive months in which the spi spei or ssi fall below a certain threshold defined as 0 in this study after calculating the spi spei and ssi three characteristics were selected to describe the drought events 1 drought intensity to describe the mean spi spei or ssi of drought events which is the average drought index of a drought event 2 drought duration which represents the length of a drought event and 3 drought severity which combines the drought intensity and duration is an integrated index obtained as a cumulative sum of drought indices to describe the destructiveness of drought events angelidis et al 2012 the specific relationships between the three indicators are presented in fig a1 the intensity duration and severity of nf mf and ff were compared with the corresponding historical indicators to analyse the relative changes in drought conditions over the next 100 years it is worth mentioning that in this study spi and spei were calculated on a pixel scale where each pixel had its own distribution function while ssi was calculated on a gauge scale discharge data from six discharge gauges located in sub basin outlets were used to calculate ssi where every gauge had its own distribution function further studies such as the meteorological drought occurrence study using severity area duration sad and the return period analysis of extreme meteorological drought will only analyse spi and will not use spei for two main reasons first the simulation of the future period is based on the parameters fitted from the log logistic distribution of the historical period and the γ parameter defines the boundary of d i thus as climate change proceeds the d i of the future period will exceed the boundary of historical γ in some regions making spei redundant for these regions particularly for the rcp8 5 scenario second it is difficult to validate the spei for the historical period as there are very few pet observations for the study area therefore to ensure the reliability of our results on the sad of meteorological drought and the return period of extreme events we selected spi to represent the meteorological drought the standard deviation std of drought intensity by spi was also calculated in this study which reflects the dispersion of drought conditions for the different periods a low std implies little fluctuation in drought conditions and a high std represents drought conditions of varying intensities more attention should be paid to regions with high std to efficiently manage water resources 3 5 drought frequency analysis extreme drought events have caused substantial damage to the economy ecology agriculture and environment particularly in major grain producing areas dracup et al 1980 drought frequency analysis is essential as it can help evaluate extreme drought and predict changes in its return period however due to the shortage of record length long return period extreme droughts such as 100 year return period droughts require a fitted probability distribution to extend the record period gev distribution is a reliable method for generating long return period drought events due to its wide applicability and stability wan et al 2018 therefore we adopted the gev distribution to calculate the change in return period of 100 year extreme droughts in future we extended the records of 30 years of historical and three future periods and constructed a relationship between drought event severity and return period which ranged from 1 year to 1000 years as per the gev fit according to particular return level say x of historical 100 year drought events we can determine the drought events in the future period with a severity equal to that of x relative changes in the two return periods are significant for investigating extreme drought changes if the new return period is greater than 100 years the frequency of extreme droughts will decrease otherwise the frequency of extreme droughts will increase 3 6 severity area duration based on meteorological drought analysis drought events are identified not only by their intensity and severity but also by their duration and area extent this study used the sad method to identify individual drought events and their spatial distribution in each month andreadis et al 2005 lal et al 2012 the definition of a drought event was extended to a three dimensional 3d scale a 3d drought event not only contains its duration and intensity but also includes spatial changes over time and the coverage of a drought event includes all pixels that are spatially contiguous values less than 0 in a given month where the value of the pixel with the smallest drought intensity must be less than 1 although the specific occurrence year and distribution pattern of future drought cases are not useful as the simulation data cannot represent the actual drought situation in the future future drought prone areas can be identified by enumerating the number and coverage of future droughts therefore drought events and their spatial distributions are quantified for different periods to demonstrate the temporal and spatial trends of drought conditions 4 results in this section we present our results through four aspects 1 reference period 1975 2004 comparison to assess the stability and representativeness of the isimip data 2 future meteorological drought changes including spi relative change analysis and extreme drought status 3 meteorological drought event analysis based on the sad method and 4 future hydrological drought analysis based on the six discharge gauges 4 1 comparison between reference and isimip data to verify the representativeness and reliability of historical isimip data and our distribution model in the historical period pixel and gauge comparisons were adopted the reference product of spi is the reanalysis precipitation of gpcc and the reference data of ssi is the discharge gauge observation from the mrc we first compared the spi by pixel and then analysed ssi at six discharge gauges by comparing the observed data with the isimip data under the gbhm simulation drought indicators in terms of duration intensity and severity were identified by gpcc and isimip historical data based on spi as shown in fig 2 based on spatial distribution fig 2a b d e g and h the spatial distribution of gpcc was more scattered showing patchy and high spatial variability however the distributions of the probability density curves of the two datasets fig 2c f and i were similar which indicates that the historical isimip data can reflect the actual situation of drought the comparison of ssi was based on six mainstream gauges the results are shown in fig 3 the relative bias was defined as follows 6 r b s i m r e f r e f where s i m is the average of the isimip and gbhm simulation of ssi r e f is the average of the reference ssi computed by observational discharge data fig 3a c present the observation and gbhm simulation probability density curves of duration intensity and severity of all six gauges the observation duration curve was smoother than the gbhm simulation duration curve indicating that long period drought events occur more in observational ssi however all curves of the three indicators were similar for the two datasets there were some deviations at luang prabang 11 in duration and 9 in intensity and pakse 13 in duration and 13 in intensity however the balance between overestimation and underestimation reduced the deviation in drought severity 4 2 change in future meteorological drought in the study area meteorological drought in the mrb and its adjacent regions is expected to significantly change in the future period relative to the historical period figs 4 and 5 show the meteorological drought relative change maps under rcp4 5 using spi and spei respectively with respect to the spi fig 4 in nf about half of the areas showed an increasing trend in drought intensity and duration fig 4a and d resulting in the regions convergence of three chinese provinces yunnan sichuan and guizhou yun gui chuan area and china thailand border jointly covered by intensity and duration showing a significant deterioration in the severity map fig 4g in the mf period drought starts to mitigate in most study areas under all three indicators except southwestern china where drought conditions were still relatively enhanced fig 4b e and h the entire study area showed a decreasing trend in duration and severity fig 4f and i in ff but the intensity map showed that a few scattered regions in the sichuan province of china and the estuary of the mekong river in vietnam had increasing drought conditions fig 4c fig 5 shows the relative change in spei based meteorological drought the relative drought intensity fig 5a c drought duration fig 5d f and drought severity fig 5g i had similar spatial distributions and the results showed that drought will be aggravated in the yun gui chuan area south tibetan plateau and lower mrb particularly in the mekong estuary area in contrast to the spi based meteorological drought the relative change in these regions for all three future periods was aggravated although the aggravation was mitigated as time progressed meteorological droughts in other regions will generally reduce by more than 90 in the future particularly during the ff period the meteorological drought identified by spei showed relative changes similar to those of spi based meteorological drought however the mitigation trend of spei based meteorological drought in the mf and ff periods was not as significant as that of the spi based meteorological drought due to the continued increase in temperature the relative change in rcp8 5 was consistent with that of rcp4 5 in spatial distribution but the worse regions become more severe in both spi based and spei based meteorological droughts fig a2 illustrates the spi based meteorological drought for rcp8 5 in the nf fig a2a d and g larger areas showed a decreasing tendency when compared with rcp4 5 particularly in the severity map fig a2g the relatively increased area accounts for almost half of our study area from middle china to cambodia however the increasing trend was substantially reduced in the mf making the mf maps of rcp8 5 almost identical to those of rcp4 5 in the ff period wettest period regions such as east india southwestern china and south vietnam showed increasing drought intensities fig a2c f and i suggesting a more uneven distribution of precipitation than rcp4 5 fig a3 shows the results of the spei based meteorological drought in rcp8 5 the trend and spatial distribution of rcp8 5 were similar to those of rcp4 5 but with more areas suffering from increased drought in the nf period fig a3a d and g whereas the area of drought mitigation in the mf and ff periods was larger than that in rcp4 5 the black regions in fig 5 and fig a3 show that d i is the out boundary of the log logistic distribution and because of the more extreme climatic conditions of rcp8 5 the out boundary regions of rcp8 5 were also larger than those of rcp4 5 particularly in the ff period fig a3c f and i the out boundary areas will directly affect the extraction of drought events while using the sad method fig 6 illustrates the std in meteorological drought intensity for the historical and the three future periods in the two rcp scenarios the std for the historical period was below 1 in most areas whereas all future periods had higher std than the historical period particularly the ff period drought relative change maps figs 4 and a2 suggest that most areas will experience decreasing drought conditions in the ff but as shown in fig 6d and g though the drought condition decreased in the ff the tendency did not decrease some regions such as southwestern china and eastern india will experience significant fluctuations where the precipitation will be more unevenly distributed temporally and severe drought events may increase it is worth mentioning that the regions with higher std in future periods are similar to those where drought is increasing in the drought relative change maps figs 4 and a2 such as southwestern china eastern india and the estuary of the mekong river in vietnam as these areas will continue to suffer from drought in future periods along with increased fluctuations in std these should be given more attention extreme droughts can be devastating and require a lot of resources during disaster relief particularly if there is inadequate forecast and preparation in terms of extreme drought events we defined droughts with a 100 year return period as extreme droughts whose change in return period in the future was analysed and compared fig 7 demonstrates the new return period maps for the nf period where both the scenarios showed an increase in extreme drought frequency in over half of the study area furthermore the extreme drought return period changed from 100 years to less than 40 years this trend covers almost the entire mrb and was most pronounced in the middle basin in the mf and ff periods extreme drought frequency decreased in most areas in some areas the return period even reached more than 1000 years for both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 both of which showed a similar spatial pattern however three regions continued to suffer from extreme droughts southwestern china border of china burma and the estuary of the mekong river in vietnam rcp8 5 fig 7d f had more areas suffering an increasing trend in extreme droughts after nf which may be caused by the uneven distribution of water resources in both spatial and temporal scales than that in rcp4 5 4 3 the severity area duration analysis of meteorological drought we identified every 3d drought event using the sad method and enumerated drought events occurring at each pixel different 3d drought events will have different durations and coverages but for each pixel a drought event will only be counted once fig 8 shows a map with the number of historical and future drought events for each pixel if a pixel experiences more 3d drought events the colour of this pixel is darker as shown in fig 8a the historical 3d drought events were concentrated in the umrb and midwest of our study area all parts of our study area suffered at least one 3d drought event but the future 3d drought events had a significant eastward migration and more drought events are expected to occur in southwestern china fig 8b and e additionally the coverage of 3d drought events decreased particularly in the ff where drought occurs almost exclusively in the east of the study area southwestern china showed the highest drought frequency with almost 20 droughts in nf and droughts concentrated even during the mf and ff periods we divided the 3d drought events into three types 1 the events that cover only china umrb 2 the events that only cover areas outside china lmrb and 3 the events that cover both regions cross border drought all the number and coverage of 3d drought events for the entire study area were also analysed fig a4 a total of 117 individual 3d drought events occurred in the historical period which is more than the nf events of rcp4 5 97 and rcp8 5 86 implying a decrease in the number of drought events in the nf combined with a relative increase in drought intensity and severity figs 4 and a2 there could be an increase in the average drought intensity and severity and that individual drought events are expected to be more severe in the nf approximately half of the events only covered areas outside china in the historical period which is also the largest percentage in nf however in the mf the two rcps showed different distributions with more than 50 of the events in rcp4 5 occurring outside china but about 60 of the events in rcp8 5 occurring only in china the percentage of cross border 3d droughts decreased slightly in the future which may be caused by uneven precipitation consequently by combining the results shown in figs 8 and a4 it can be inferred that future droughts will be less frequent but more concentrated 4 4 change in future hydrological drought in mrb hydrological drought is the accumulation of water resource shortages on spatial and temporal scales and the hydrological droughts are generally analysed at the basin scale the mrb is centrally located in the study area and its hydrological drought conditions directly affect the major countries and most of the inhabitants of the study area therefore we adopted the ssi of six discharge stations shown in fig 1 in the mainstream mekong river to demonstrate hydrological drought in the study area fig 9 shows the relative change in rcp4 5 ssi from upstream to downstream sites in the nf period the three indices of all gauges increased however the increase in the downstream gauges was much more significant the drought duration gradually increased from upstream to downstream for example the duration of mukdahan pakse and stung trend fig 9d f changed from approximately 175 to over 220 months and the drought intensity and severity showed similar spatial distributions the average intensity of stung treng increased from 0 84 mild drought to 1 56 severe drought and the average severity increased by more than 150 in the mf and ff periods drought was found to be mitigated in all six gauges and drought duration and severity of most gauges reduced by more than 50 the drought months of all gauges in mf and ff periods were less than 100 except for stung treng 124 drought months in ff the mitigation of upstream gauges was more significant than that of downstream gauges the ff intensity at stung treng increased marginally indicating that only the drought duration and severity will decrease and not the average intensity thus droughts will still occur this result is consistent with that of previous studies on meteorological droughts the rcp8 5 ssi results are presented in fig a5 the trends in rcp8 5 are similar to those of rcp4 5 but the changes are more significant an approximately 30 increase in duration 50 in intensity and 100 in severity occurred in rcp8 5 for the nf period and drought in downstream gauges became more severe in the mf period there was almost no change in intensity indicating that the drought intensity in mf will be similar to that of the historical period however as the drought duration decreased in mf and led to a decrease in severity droughts in the mf showed an overall reduction in the ff period chiang saen and luang prabang suffered no drought and the drought intensity in nong khai was reduced by more than 90 drought conditions at the other three gauges were also found to be significantly alleviated with average intensity increasing from approximately 0 8 to 0 3 0 5 at stung treng though both 0 8 and 0 3 indicate mild drought average drought conditions will significantly mitigate the drought duration in the ff will change from approximately 170 months to less than 5 months chiang sean luang prabang and nong khai and less than 65 months mukdahan pakse and stung treng consequently the drought severity of all gauges was reduced by more than 75 and the change in the upstream gauges was greater than that of the downstream gauges 5 discussion and conclusions 5 1 future precipitation change future drought conditions reveal an increasing trend in the eastern study area and a decreasing trend in the western study area in the nf but a decreasing trend in the entire study area after the mf fig 10 shows the future rainfall patterns to indicate the reasons for future drought changes the precipitation in the nf increased in the west and decreased in the east fig 10b and e which is consistent with the drought change pattern in the nf and ff precipitation will increase and reduce the drought in most areas except south laos where the drought state worsens even in the ff precipitation has a generally increasing trend from the temporal aspect fig 10a but oscillated around 0 in the nf leading to an increased drought state in some years when the precipitation increased in mf and ff droughts decreased figs 4 and 5 and figs a2 and a3 5 2 future temperature change temperature is another primary factor influencing evaporation and water demand thereby influencing drought both directly and indirectly jeong et al 2014 karl et al 2012 numerous studies have been conducted on temperature and drought barber et al 2000 karnieli et al 2010 matiu et al 2017 the results shown in fig a6 suggest temporal and spatial changes in temperature the temperature will increase consistently in the future both rpc4 5 and rcp8 5 showed little difference in nf but the increasing trend of rcp4 5 slowed down in ff while the increasing trend of rcp8 5 was constant and is expected to reach a temperature rise of 6 degrees at the end of this century fig a6a the spatial pattern fig a6b g illustrates a severe warming in the tibetan plateau and the least warming effect in the southern coastal areas although spi does not include temperature as a factor to evaluate meteorological drought spei and ssi contain information on future temperatures using pet and modelling discharge comparing the results of spi based and spei based meteorological droughts the spei with the addition of temperature showed higher drought aggravated areas which is consistent with the increasing trend of future temperature nevertheless spei is determined by a combination of precipitation and temperature and possibly more variables if pet is calculated by other methods in future periods when both precipitation and temperature increase the reduction in drought in mf and ff periods as compared to the nf period suggests that the impact of increased precipitation in the future will probably be greater than the impact of increased temperature additionally the change in temperature in the future also affects the life and economy of the mrb and its surrounding areas constant warming will undoubtedly aggravate water shortage and severity of extreme drought disasters which will not disappear in the future and will even increase in frequency in some areas fig 7 therefore although future droughts will generally mitigate in both meteorology and hydrology considering the increase in extreme drought events and water shortage the future drought state is not optimistic 5 3 conclusion in this study spi spei and ssi were used to assess historical and future droughts over the mrb and its surrounding areas and relative changes were analysed between historical and future periods under two climate change scenarios for the five gcms generally both meteorological and hydrological droughts in the study area were significantly affected by climate change and showed a trend of increasing in the nf and then decreasing in the mf and ff spi based and spei based meteorological droughts were consistent in time series and spatial patterns although meteorological drought both from spi and spei mitigated in most areas after the nf there were several regions such as southwestern china and the mekong river estuary region in vietnam which will suffer from a continuously increasing drought intensity as well as higher extreme drought frequency spi based on the other hand meteorological drought events are expected to reduce in the future but become more concentrated and the coverage of drought events showed a significant migration from west to east it should be noted that although the total precipitation is expected to increase in the future the droughts will not disappear and may even increase in some regions because of a more uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation in addition the results of spei and ssi suggest that the warming trend in temperature is another factor that aggravates drought

8208,study region mekong river basin and surrounding areas study focus this study investigated the impacts of climate change on future meteorological and hydrological droughts in the mekong river basin and its surrounding areas our work is based on the output of five global climate models gcms and simulations using the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm for the historical 1975 2004 near future 2010 2039 middle future 2040 2069 and far future 2070 2099 periods the meteorological droughts in the study area were measured using spi and spei while the hydrological droughts were measured using ssi new hydrological insights for the region the results suggest that droughts will generally reduce in the future over most of the study area but will be more unevenly distributed with an eastward migration as compared to the historical period both meteorological and hydrological droughts will intensify in the near future but will then reduce in intensity meteorological droughts will increase in the northeastern areas in the near future followed by migration towards the south hydrological droughts showed similar aggravation followed by reduction with upstream areas showing greater variability in the general context of drought alleviation southwestern china and the mekong river estuary may suffer from a continuously increasing drought intensity in the future this finding is based on 100 year extreme drought events keywords drought spi spei ssi mekong river basin climate change 1 introduction drought is an unpredictable climatic event that can be extremely destructive to the economy society and the natural environment currently though drought detection and monitoring technologies have greatly improved drought characteristics are still unclear wilhite 2000 drought is generally divided into three types 1 meteorological drought which usually originates from a lack of precipitation 2 hydrological drought mainly caused by a deficiency of streamflow and water storage and 3 agricultural drought a combination of the former two droughts caused by the reduction in soil moisture storage dai 2011 mishra and singh 2010 sheffield et al 2004 van loon 2015 various drought indices have been developed to investigate droughts in detail the palmer drought severity index pdsi wayne 1965 is the first comprehensive index to assess moisture status on spatial and temporal scales and is widely used globally chou et al 2013 diaz 1983 mu et al 2013 sheffield et al 2004 the standardized precipitation index spi an index widely used in the detection of meteorological drought and precipitation abnormalities was proposed in 1993 huang et al 2016 mckee et al 1993 however as spi is a single scalar index that corresponds only to precipitation the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and standardized streamflow index ssi vicente serrano et al 2011 were proposed to evaluate meteorological including the role of temperature and hydrological droughts at 1 month to 48 month scales spei is related to both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration temperature and has the advantage of combining multi scale characters with the ability to include the impact of temperature in drought assessment vicente serrano et al 2010 several studies have highlighted that as global warming continues increasing temperature and changing precipitation patterns will have direct effects on drought events leading to an uneven distribution across spatial and temporal scales dai 2013 hao and singh 2015 sheffield and wood 2007 although numerous studies have been conducted to assess future drought conditions under various climate change scenarios the results vary geographically generally the total drought events are expected to decrease globally but extreme droughts would increase regionally dubrovský et al 2014 lutz et al 2014 sheffield and wood 2007 wan et al 2018 wang et al 2014 zhao and dai 2016 under a changing environment drought is not a purely natural hazard as humans have altered the characteristics of droughts by changing their coping mechanisms tang 2020 van loon et al 2016 climate change and human activities are considered to have both direct and indirect impacts on drought events the direct impacts occur due to irrigation snowmelt and reservoir operation whereas the indirect impacts correspond to landscape change deforestation and population growth he et al 2017 guo et al 2017 qiu 2010 the mekong river is the most important transboundary river in asia and plays a critical role in agricultural production and water resource sustainability in its surrounding areas previous studies have suggested that the mekong river basin mrb suffered several extreme droughts in the last two decades and will encounter more severe and intense droughts in the future which has caused and will cause extensive economic losses and threat to human survival nguyen and shaw 2011 son et al 2012 thilakarathne and sridhar 2017 however research conducted in this region has not examined the difference between the changes in meteorological and hydrological droughts based on historical data and there is a lack of quantitative assessments of future extreme meteorological droughts therefore the purpose of this study was to quantitatively investigate the characteristics of future droughts in the mrb and its adjacent regions under climate change scenarios from meteorological and hydrological aspects using global climate models gcms and the distribution hydrological model 2 study area this study focused on regions fig 1 around the mrb from 5 n to 35 n and from 90 e to 110 e including countries in the indo china peninsula myanmar lao pdr thailand cambodia and vietnam and several southwestern provinces in china sichuan yunnan guangxi tibet and guizhou several states of india assam nagaland meghalaya manipur tripura and mizoram and sylhet division of bangladesh a majority of the study areas is humid and precipitation in the study area is affected by the summer monsoon from may to september each year the mekong river is in the centre of the study area and rises in the tibetan plateau and flows through the yunnan province in china myanmar lao pdr thailand cambodia and vietnam and finally discharges into the south china sea the mekong river is one of the world s longest rivers with a length of 4909 km and the 21st largest river with a 795 000 km2 drainage area and 14 500 m3 s average annual discharge basin 2010 wang et al 2017 the topographies of the mrb are complex and have large spatial variability the upper mekong river in china is called the lancang river originating from the tibetan plateau with an altitude ranging from 6 000 500 m the upper mekong river basin umrb and its surrounding regions referred to as the northern part of the study area within china contain plateaus terraces hills valleys and mountains and its landcover types changed from grassland to a mix of cropland agroforestry and shrub from west to east the annual average precipitation of umrb is 962 3 mm which is concentrated in summer accounting for 55 of the total annual precipitation chen et al 2017 tang et al 2019 the umrb has an area of 170 000 km2 accounts for approximately 21 of the total mrb area and contributes only 15 of the total streamflow volume manivong and schindele 2004 the lower mekong river basin lmrb and its surrounding areas referred to as the southern part of the study area outside of china cover myanmar thailand vietnam and cambodia and parts of india the lmrb is covered with a large amount of forest and cropland the annual precipitation in the lmrb reaches 2000 mm which is twice that of the umrb therefore lmrb contributes 85 of the total streamflow volume manivong and schindele 2004 in contrast to the umrb lmrb has developed tributaries which produce approximately 4 million tons of fish and aquatic products every year providing important sources of protein and economic resources for local residents basin 2015 3 data and methodology 3 1 geomorphology based hydrological model in this study the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm was applied to simulate the future discharge of the mekong river the gbhm has been successfully used in several rivers worldwide to forecast floods and assess the impacts of climate change and landcover change cong et al 2009 gao et al 2008 li et al 2019 tang et al 2011 wang and wang 2006 wang et al 2016 2017 xu et al 2008 2013 yang et al 2004 the gbhm uses a digital elevation model dem to generate a digital basin for simulating discharge the model divides the entire basin into a number of flow intervals based on the distance from the outlet to the upper source it then generates the fundamental computational unit flow interval hillslope using area and width functions subsequently two dimensional water kinematics is simplified to a single dimension other hydrological processes including snowmelt canopy interception and evapotranspiration are calculated by a physical model for each hillslope and the discharge is calculated by a nonlinear numerical river routing scheme yang et al 2002 a gbhm with a 0 5 0 5 resolution and 49 sub basins was applied in this study the parameters and other auxiliary data of gbhm are shown in table 1 and the model setup and calibration follow previous studies on mrb wang et al 2016 2017 3 2 future climate projections the meteorological forcing data of gbhm were obtained from the bias corrected daily climate model outputs of five gcms hadgem2 es miroc esm chem gfdl esm2m noresm1 m and ipsl cm5a lr produced by the intersectoral impact model intercomparison project isi mip warszawski et al 2014 all five gcms contain two representative concentration pathways rcps rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 a comprehensive understanding of drought conditions for a region requires us to not only study historical and current droughts but also to understand future droughts mishra and singh 2010 therefore both the historical 1975 2004 and future 2010 2099 periods were included in this study the future period was divided into three 30 year periods for equal comparison near future 2010 2039 nf middle future 2040 2069 mf and far future 2070 2099 ff the five averaged gcm datasets were corrected for bias and statistically downscaled to 0 5 0 5 and daily time steps to meet the requirements of the hydrological model hempel et al 2013 3 3 reference data the gridded gauge analysis products of the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc were derived from quality controlled station data the product spans from 1891 to 2016 on regular latitude longitude grids at a 0 5 0 5 resolution rudolf et al 2005 schneider et al 2011 the 1975 2004 monthly precipitation of gpcc version full v2018 was used as reference data to assess the reliability and statistical representativeness of isimip for the historical period the discharge gauge observations from the mekong river commission mrc were used to validate the stability of the ssi based on the gbhm output all six discharge stations chiang saen luang prabang nong khai mukdahan pakse and stung treng are located downstream of the mekong river and have a relatively large and stable streamflow fig 1 it is worth mentioning that the lower sites contain accumulation information of the upper sub basins 3 4 drought indices spi spei and ssi to comprehensively investigate drought conditions spi spei and ssi were used to evaluate the meteorological drought spi and spei and hydrological drought ssi conditions under the spi the gamma probability distribution function was used to identify the historical drought conditions and then further normalise and standardise the parameters to obtain the historical spi spi evaluates drought conditions based on precipitation whereas spei evaluates drought based on the difference between precipitation and potential evaporation pet as the difference between precipitation and pet can be negative the log logistic distribution is used to calculate spei which has three parameters and can extend the lower boundary below 0 various options exist for the distribution of ssi such as normal pearson iii gamma general extreme value gev log logistic and lognormal which are all widely accepted distributions and have been used in different basins worldwide chen et al 2018 kang and jiang 2019 shamshirband et al 2020 telesca et al 2012 tijdeman et al 2020 vicente serrano et al 2011 wan et al 2018 although different basins have different suitable distributions gev is one of the most widely used distributions for ssi due to its high value description and flexibility chen et al 2018 kang and jiang 2019 tijdeman et al 2020 vicente serrano et al 2011 thus in this study the gev was adapted to fit the streamflow series and calculate the ssi future drought was calculated based on the historical rainfall distribution established earlier to maintain the consistency of the comparison and demonstrate the relative changes hasegawa et al 2016 huang et al 2016 the calculation function of the ssi and spi is shown below 1 s p i s s i s t c 2 t c 1 t c 0 d 3 t d 2 t d 1 t 1 0 where t l n 1 p x 2 p x is the probability density function of precipitation or discharge s is a coefficient of probability density when p x 0 5 s 1 when p x 0 5 s 1 x is the amount of monthly precipitation or discharge c0 c1 c2 d1 d2 and d3 are constants with values of 2 515517 0 802853 0 010328 1 432788 0 189269 and 0 001308 respectively angelidis et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2011 the probability density function for spi is defined as 2 p x 1 β α γ α x α 1 e x β where α 0 is the shape parameter β 0 is the scale parameter and γ α is the gamma function which is defined as 3 γ α 0 y α 1 e y d y the pet was estimated following the thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1948 vicente serrano et al 2010 the probability density function for spei is defined as 4a ƒ x β α x γ α β 1 1 x γ α β 2 where α β and γ are the scale shape and origin parameters respectively of the log logistic distribution and can be obtained as 4b β 2 ω 1 ω 0 6 ω 1 ω 0 6 ω 2 4c α ω 0 2 ω 1 β γ 1 1 β γ 1 1 β 4d γ ω 0 α γ 1 1 β γ 1 1 β where ω s can be calculated as 4e ω s 1 n i 1 n 1 f i s d i where d i is the difference in month i between precipitation and pet n is the number of data points and f i is a frequency estimator f i can be calculated as 4f f i i 0 35 n the probability density function for ssi is defined as 5a ƒ ξ μ σ x 1 σ 1 ξ x μ σ 1 1 ξ e x p 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ ξ 0 and 5b ƒ 0 μ σ x 1 σ e x μ σ exp e x μ σ ξ 0 where ξ is the tail shape parameter μ is the location parameter and σ is the scale parameter markose and alentorn 2011 a drought event is the sum of consecutive months in which the spi spei or ssi fall below a certain threshold defined as 0 in this study after calculating the spi spei and ssi three characteristics were selected to describe the drought events 1 drought intensity to describe the mean spi spei or ssi of drought events which is the average drought index of a drought event 2 drought duration which represents the length of a drought event and 3 drought severity which combines the drought intensity and duration is an integrated index obtained as a cumulative sum of drought indices to describe the destructiveness of drought events angelidis et al 2012 the specific relationships between the three indicators are presented in fig a1 the intensity duration and severity of nf mf and ff were compared with the corresponding historical indicators to analyse the relative changes in drought conditions over the next 100 years it is worth mentioning that in this study spi and spei were calculated on a pixel scale where each pixel had its own distribution function while ssi was calculated on a gauge scale discharge data from six discharge gauges located in sub basin outlets were used to calculate ssi where every gauge had its own distribution function further studies such as the meteorological drought occurrence study using severity area duration sad and the return period analysis of extreme meteorological drought will only analyse spi and will not use spei for two main reasons first the simulation of the future period is based on the parameters fitted from the log logistic distribution of the historical period and the γ parameter defines the boundary of d i thus as climate change proceeds the d i of the future period will exceed the boundary of historical γ in some regions making spei redundant for these regions particularly for the rcp8 5 scenario second it is difficult to validate the spei for the historical period as there are very few pet observations for the study area therefore to ensure the reliability of our results on the sad of meteorological drought and the return period of extreme events we selected spi to represent the meteorological drought the standard deviation std of drought intensity by spi was also calculated in this study which reflects the dispersion of drought conditions for the different periods a low std implies little fluctuation in drought conditions and a high std represents drought conditions of varying intensities more attention should be paid to regions with high std to efficiently manage water resources 3 5 drought frequency analysis extreme drought events have caused substantial damage to the economy ecology agriculture and environment particularly in major grain producing areas dracup et al 1980 drought frequency analysis is essential as it can help evaluate extreme drought and predict changes in its return period however due to the shortage of record length long return period extreme droughts such as 100 year return period droughts require a fitted probability distribution to extend the record period gev distribution is a reliable method for generating long return period drought events due to its wide applicability and stability wan et al 2018 therefore we adopted the gev distribution to calculate the change in return period of 100 year extreme droughts in future we extended the records of 30 years of historical and three future periods and constructed a relationship between drought event severity and return period which ranged from 1 year to 1000 years as per the gev fit according to particular return level say x of historical 100 year drought events we can determine the drought events in the future period with a severity equal to that of x relative changes in the two return periods are significant for investigating extreme drought changes if the new return period is greater than 100 years the frequency of extreme droughts will decrease otherwise the frequency of extreme droughts will increase 3 6 severity area duration based on meteorological drought analysis drought events are identified not only by their intensity and severity but also by their duration and area extent this study used the sad method to identify individual drought events and their spatial distribution in each month andreadis et al 2005 lal et al 2012 the definition of a drought event was extended to a three dimensional 3d scale a 3d drought event not only contains its duration and intensity but also includes spatial changes over time and the coverage of a drought event includes all pixels that are spatially contiguous values less than 0 in a given month where the value of the pixel with the smallest drought intensity must be less than 1 although the specific occurrence year and distribution pattern of future drought cases are not useful as the simulation data cannot represent the actual drought situation in the future future drought prone areas can be identified by enumerating the number and coverage of future droughts therefore drought events and their spatial distributions are quantified for different periods to demonstrate the temporal and spatial trends of drought conditions 4 results in this section we present our results through four aspects 1 reference period 1975 2004 comparison to assess the stability and representativeness of the isimip data 2 future meteorological drought changes including spi relative change analysis and extreme drought status 3 meteorological drought event analysis based on the sad method and 4 future hydrological drought analysis based on the six discharge gauges 4 1 comparison between reference and isimip data to verify the representativeness and reliability of historical isimip data and our distribution model in the historical period pixel and gauge comparisons were adopted the reference product of spi is the reanalysis precipitation of gpcc and the reference data of ssi is the discharge gauge observation from the mrc we first compared the spi by pixel and then analysed ssi at six discharge gauges by comparing the observed data with the isimip data under the gbhm simulation drought indicators in terms of duration intensity and severity were identified by gpcc and isimip historical data based on spi as shown in fig 2 based on spatial distribution fig 2a b d e g and h the spatial distribution of gpcc was more scattered showing patchy and high spatial variability however the distributions of the probability density curves of the two datasets fig 2c f and i were similar which indicates that the historical isimip data can reflect the actual situation of drought the comparison of ssi was based on six mainstream gauges the results are shown in fig 3 the relative bias was defined as follows 6 r b s i m r e f r e f where s i m is the average of the isimip and gbhm simulation of ssi r e f is the average of the reference ssi computed by observational discharge data fig 3a c present the observation and gbhm simulation probability density curves of duration intensity and severity of all six gauges the observation duration curve was smoother than the gbhm simulation duration curve indicating that long period drought events occur more in observational ssi however all curves of the three indicators were similar for the two datasets there were some deviations at luang prabang 11 in duration and 9 in intensity and pakse 13 in duration and 13 in intensity however the balance between overestimation and underestimation reduced the deviation in drought severity 4 2 change in future meteorological drought in the study area meteorological drought in the mrb and its adjacent regions is expected to significantly change in the future period relative to the historical period figs 4 and 5 show the meteorological drought relative change maps under rcp4 5 using spi and spei respectively with respect to the spi fig 4 in nf about half of the areas showed an increasing trend in drought intensity and duration fig 4a and d resulting in the regions convergence of three chinese provinces yunnan sichuan and guizhou yun gui chuan area and china thailand border jointly covered by intensity and duration showing a significant deterioration in the severity map fig 4g in the mf period drought starts to mitigate in most study areas under all three indicators except southwestern china where drought conditions were still relatively enhanced fig 4b e and h the entire study area showed a decreasing trend in duration and severity fig 4f and i in ff but the intensity map showed that a few scattered regions in the sichuan province of china and the estuary of the mekong river in vietnam had increasing drought conditions fig 4c fig 5 shows the relative change in spei based meteorological drought the relative drought intensity fig 5a c drought duration fig 5d f and drought severity fig 5g i had similar spatial distributions and the results showed that drought will be aggravated in the yun gui chuan area south tibetan plateau and lower mrb particularly in the mekong estuary area in contrast to the spi based meteorological drought the relative change in these regions for all three future periods was aggravated although the aggravation was mitigated as time progressed meteorological droughts in other regions will generally reduce by more than 90 in the future particularly during the ff period the meteorological drought identified by spei showed relative changes similar to those of spi based meteorological drought however the mitigation trend of spei based meteorological drought in the mf and ff periods was not as significant as that of the spi based meteorological drought due to the continued increase in temperature the relative change in rcp8 5 was consistent with that of rcp4 5 in spatial distribution but the worse regions become more severe in both spi based and spei based meteorological droughts fig a2 illustrates the spi based meteorological drought for rcp8 5 in the nf fig a2a d and g larger areas showed a decreasing tendency when compared with rcp4 5 particularly in the severity map fig a2g the relatively increased area accounts for almost half of our study area from middle china to cambodia however the increasing trend was substantially reduced in the mf making the mf maps of rcp8 5 almost identical to those of rcp4 5 in the ff period wettest period regions such as east india southwestern china and south vietnam showed increasing drought intensities fig a2c f and i suggesting a more uneven distribution of precipitation than rcp4 5 fig a3 shows the results of the spei based meteorological drought in rcp8 5 the trend and spatial distribution of rcp8 5 were similar to those of rcp4 5 but with more areas suffering from increased drought in the nf period fig a3a d and g whereas the area of drought mitigation in the mf and ff periods was larger than that in rcp4 5 the black regions in fig 5 and fig a3 show that d i is the out boundary of the log logistic distribution and because of the more extreme climatic conditions of rcp8 5 the out boundary regions of rcp8 5 were also larger than those of rcp4 5 particularly in the ff period fig a3c f and i the out boundary areas will directly affect the extraction of drought events while using the sad method fig 6 illustrates the std in meteorological drought intensity for the historical and the three future periods in the two rcp scenarios the std for the historical period was below 1 in most areas whereas all future periods had higher std than the historical period particularly the ff period drought relative change maps figs 4 and a2 suggest that most areas will experience decreasing drought conditions in the ff but as shown in fig 6d and g though the drought condition decreased in the ff the tendency did not decrease some regions such as southwestern china and eastern india will experience significant fluctuations where the precipitation will be more unevenly distributed temporally and severe drought events may increase it is worth mentioning that the regions with higher std in future periods are similar to those where drought is increasing in the drought relative change maps figs 4 and a2 such as southwestern china eastern india and the estuary of the mekong river in vietnam as these areas will continue to suffer from drought in future periods along with increased fluctuations in std these should be given more attention extreme droughts can be devastating and require a lot of resources during disaster relief particularly if there is inadequate forecast and preparation in terms of extreme drought events we defined droughts with a 100 year return period as extreme droughts whose change in return period in the future was analysed and compared fig 7 demonstrates the new return period maps for the nf period where both the scenarios showed an increase in extreme drought frequency in over half of the study area furthermore the extreme drought return period changed from 100 years to less than 40 years this trend covers almost the entire mrb and was most pronounced in the middle basin in the mf and ff periods extreme drought frequency decreased in most areas in some areas the return period even reached more than 1000 years for both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 both of which showed a similar spatial pattern however three regions continued to suffer from extreme droughts southwestern china border of china burma and the estuary of the mekong river in vietnam rcp8 5 fig 7d f had more areas suffering an increasing trend in extreme droughts after nf which may be caused by the uneven distribution of water resources in both spatial and temporal scales than that in rcp4 5 4 3 the severity area duration analysis of meteorological drought we identified every 3d drought event using the sad method and enumerated drought events occurring at each pixel different 3d drought events will have different durations and coverages but for each pixel a drought event will only be counted once fig 8 shows a map with the number of historical and future drought events for each pixel if a pixel experiences more 3d drought events the colour of this pixel is darker as shown in fig 8a the historical 3d drought events were concentrated in the umrb and midwest of our study area all parts of our study area suffered at least one 3d drought event but the future 3d drought events had a significant eastward migration and more drought events are expected to occur in southwestern china fig 8b and e additionally the coverage of 3d drought events decreased particularly in the ff where drought occurs almost exclusively in the east of the study area southwestern china showed the highest drought frequency with almost 20 droughts in nf and droughts concentrated even during the mf and ff periods we divided the 3d drought events into three types 1 the events that cover only china umrb 2 the events that only cover areas outside china lmrb and 3 the events that cover both regions cross border drought all the number and coverage of 3d drought events for the entire study area were also analysed fig a4 a total of 117 individual 3d drought events occurred in the historical period which is more than the nf events of rcp4 5 97 and rcp8 5 86 implying a decrease in the number of drought events in the nf combined with a relative increase in drought intensity and severity figs 4 and a2 there could be an increase in the average drought intensity and severity and that individual drought events are expected to be more severe in the nf approximately half of the events only covered areas outside china in the historical period which is also the largest percentage in nf however in the mf the two rcps showed different distributions with more than 50 of the events in rcp4 5 occurring outside china but about 60 of the events in rcp8 5 occurring only in china the percentage of cross border 3d droughts decreased slightly in the future which may be caused by uneven precipitation consequently by combining the results shown in figs 8 and a4 it can be inferred that future droughts will be less frequent but more concentrated 4 4 change in future hydrological drought in mrb hydrological drought is the accumulation of water resource shortages on spatial and temporal scales and the hydrological droughts are generally analysed at the basin scale the mrb is centrally located in the study area and its hydrological drought conditions directly affect the major countries and most of the inhabitants of the study area therefore we adopted the ssi of six discharge stations shown in fig 1 in the mainstream mekong river to demonstrate hydrological drought in the study area fig 9 shows the relative change in rcp4 5 ssi from upstream to downstream sites in the nf period the three indices of all gauges increased however the increase in the downstream gauges was much more significant the drought duration gradually increased from upstream to downstream for example the duration of mukdahan pakse and stung trend fig 9d f changed from approximately 175 to over 220 months and the drought intensity and severity showed similar spatial distributions the average intensity of stung treng increased from 0 84 mild drought to 1 56 severe drought and the average severity increased by more than 150 in the mf and ff periods drought was found to be mitigated in all six gauges and drought duration and severity of most gauges reduced by more than 50 the drought months of all gauges in mf and ff periods were less than 100 except for stung treng 124 drought months in ff the mitigation of upstream gauges was more significant than that of downstream gauges the ff intensity at stung treng increased marginally indicating that only the drought duration and severity will decrease and not the average intensity thus droughts will still occur this result is consistent with that of previous studies on meteorological droughts the rcp8 5 ssi results are presented in fig a5 the trends in rcp8 5 are similar to those of rcp4 5 but the changes are more significant an approximately 30 increase in duration 50 in intensity and 100 in severity occurred in rcp8 5 for the nf period and drought in downstream gauges became more severe in the mf period there was almost no change in intensity indicating that the drought intensity in mf will be similar to that of the historical period however as the drought duration decreased in mf and led to a decrease in severity droughts in the mf showed an overall reduction in the ff period chiang saen and luang prabang suffered no drought and the drought intensity in nong khai was reduced by more than 90 drought conditions at the other three gauges were also found to be significantly alleviated with average intensity increasing from approximately 0 8 to 0 3 0 5 at stung treng though both 0 8 and 0 3 indicate mild drought average drought conditions will significantly mitigate the drought duration in the ff will change from approximately 170 months to less than 5 months chiang sean luang prabang and nong khai and less than 65 months mukdahan pakse and stung treng consequently the drought severity of all gauges was reduced by more than 75 and the change in the upstream gauges was greater than that of the downstream gauges 5 discussion and conclusions 5 1 future precipitation change future drought conditions reveal an increasing trend in the eastern study area and a decreasing trend in the western study area in the nf but a decreasing trend in the entire study area after the mf fig 10 shows the future rainfall patterns to indicate the reasons for future drought changes the precipitation in the nf increased in the west and decreased in the east fig 10b and e which is consistent with the drought change pattern in the nf and ff precipitation will increase and reduce the drought in most areas except south laos where the drought state worsens even in the ff precipitation has a generally increasing trend from the temporal aspect fig 10a but oscillated around 0 in the nf leading to an increased drought state in some years when the precipitation increased in mf and ff droughts decreased figs 4 and 5 and figs a2 and a3 5 2 future temperature change temperature is another primary factor influencing evaporation and water demand thereby influencing drought both directly and indirectly jeong et al 2014 karl et al 2012 numerous studies have been conducted on temperature and drought barber et al 2000 karnieli et al 2010 matiu et al 2017 the results shown in fig a6 suggest temporal and spatial changes in temperature the temperature will increase consistently in the future both rpc4 5 and rcp8 5 showed little difference in nf but the increasing trend of rcp4 5 slowed down in ff while the increasing trend of rcp8 5 was constant and is expected to reach a temperature rise of 6 degrees at the end of this century fig a6a the spatial pattern fig a6b g illustrates a severe warming in the tibetan plateau and the least warming effect in the southern coastal areas although spi does not include temperature as a factor to evaluate meteorological drought spei and ssi contain information on future temperatures using pet and modelling discharge comparing the results of spi based and spei based meteorological droughts the spei with the addition of temperature showed higher drought aggravated areas which is consistent with the increasing trend of future temperature nevertheless spei is determined by a combination of precipitation and temperature and possibly more variables if pet is calculated by other methods in future periods when both precipitation and temperature increase the reduction in drought in mf and ff periods as compared to the nf period suggests that the impact of increased precipitation in the future will probably be greater than the impact of increased temperature additionally the change in temperature in the future also affects the life and economy of the mrb and its surrounding areas constant warming will undoubtedly aggravate water shortage and severity of extreme drought disasters which will not disappear in the future and will even increase in frequency in some areas fig 7 therefore although future droughts will generally mitigate in both meteorology and hydrology considering the increase in extreme drought events and water shortage the future drought state is not optimistic 5 3 conclusion in this study spi spei and ssi were used to assess historical and future droughts over the mrb and its surrounding areas and relative changes were analysed between historical and future periods under two climate change scenarios for the five gcms generally both meteorological and hydrological droughts in the study area were significantly affected by climate change and showed a trend of increasing in the nf and then decreasing in the mf and ff spi based and spei based meteorological droughts were consistent in time series and spatial patterns although meteorological drought both from spi and spei mitigated in most areas after the nf there were several regions such as southwestern china and the mekong river estuary region in vietnam which will suffer from a continuously increasing drought intensity as well as higher extreme drought frequency spi based on the other hand meteorological drought events are expected to reduce in the future but become more concentrated and the coverage of drought events showed a significant migration from west to east it should be noted that although the total precipitation is expected to increase in the future the droughts will not disappear and may even increase in some regions because of a more uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation in addition the results of spei and ssi suggest that the warming trend in temperature is another factor that aggravates drought

8209,study region awash river basin ethiopia study focus many river basins in sub saharan africa have become vulnerable due to the impact from climate change weak governance and high levels of poverty one of the primary concerns is the elevated salinity and the degradation of water quality in the awash river located in the great rift valley in ethiopia the awash river has unique hydrochemistry due to water rock interactions however in recent years increasing anthropogenic activities including the discharge from saline lake beseka into the awash river has caused some concern this study used an integrated catchment model to simulate chloride concentration in the awash river basin by taking both natural and anthropogenic sources of salinity into consideration future scenarios of climate change and lake beseka discharge were examined to assess the impact to the river water quality new hydrologic insights results show that lake beseka has made significant contribution to the rise of the salinity in the awash river if the trend of human interference e g increased irrigation and unregulated water transfer continues the river downstream of lake beseka could see cl increases up to 200 in the near future 2006 2030 the modeling results are essential for generating long term plans for proper utilization of water resources especially in the region where the resources and the economic capacity to meet the water demand is lacking keywords salinity chloride lake beseka climate change 1 introduction water scarcity is one of the most pressing environmental and societal issues worldwide and affects human health food security and ecosystem that potentially lead to mass migration brzoska and fröhlich 2016 gray and mueller 2012 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 in sub saharan africa there are many vulnerable river basins due to the impact from climate change weak governance and high levels of poverty hirpa et al 2019 taye et al 2018 the awash river basin is one area of concern as the catchment is subject to not only high climatic variability with frequent floods and droughts but also the impact of the rapid growth of agriculture industries and urbanization as well as population growth within the awash basin taye et al 2018 all of these have placed excessive pressures on the basin s water resources in addition the decreases in flow reduce the dilution power in the river system the growing human population and the expansion of industrial and agricultural activities have contributed point source and non point source pollutions to the awash river that inevitably degrade the water quality bussi et al 2021 nigussie and getaneh 2016 the hydrochemistry of the awash river basin is unique and characterized as wide spatial variations in total dissolved solids tds and ionic concentrations due to differences in water rock interactions related to geology groundwater residence time geomorphological setting and climate ayenew 2005 darling et al 1996 in general the highland waters are homogeneous and characterized by lower tds 50 1200 mg l with the dominantly calcium magnesium bicarbonate type ayenew 2005 the tds increases towards the rift valley following the regional groundwater flow directions from areas of high rainfall and low evaporation to the semi arid rift floor the rift valley waters are dominantly sodium bicarbonate type with high tds 200 and 73 000 mg l and enriched fluoride ayenew 2005 ayenew et al 2008 this chemical feature of varied tds is evident in the awash river basin where bicarbonate dominates the upper awash water and changes to high chloride cl type in the middle and low awash river due to changes in lithology related to evaporite deposit ayenew 2005 in addition lake beseka located within the awash river basin is an exceptional lake that was extremely saline in 1960s with the cl concentration of over 5 000 mg l due to its unique geological and hydrogeological settings olumana dinka 2017 talling and talling 1965 since then substantial increase in lake volume area and depth has been observed there is concern that the continued growth of lake beseka from increased groundwater inflow to the lake resulting from an increase from irrigation activities would eventually make lake beseka cross the awash river catchment boundary and join the river that could result in numerous negative environmental and economic consequences dinka 2017 high salinity of lake beseka water would significantly impact the river water chemistry and put another pressure to the already stressed water resources it could also affect the groundwater system and the aquatic ecosystem downstream the rise in salinity of the river water could affect the large fertile irrigated farmlands located downstream with soil salinization dinka 2017 this situation is a serious threat to the socio economic stability of the entire awash river basin and it requires regular monitoring and an appropriate management system various organizations including the ministry of water irrigation and electricity of ethiopia mowie have tried to control the lake level since the early 2010s by setting up pumps excavating a canal and discharging the lake water into the river teffera et al 2018 wwdse 2010 however a comprehensive assessment is still needed to understand the impact to the downstream water quality from mixing the lake beseka water with the river water in this paper the influence of human factors in combination with the natural conditions of climate and geology on the water quality in the region will be examined we will use an integrated catchment model to simulate chloride concentration in the awash river basin including lake beseka considering both natural and anthropogenic sources of salinity future scenarios including climate change and the discharge of lake beseka water into the awash river will be analyzed this is the first study that uses a semi distributed model application to assess the river flow lake beseka discharge and its impact on river water quality in a holistic way in the awash river basin understanding the impact from climate change and increased anthropogenic activities is needed to set up suitable water management policies and regulate the uses of water resources in the awash river basin this study also provides insights into river basin management for other places that face similar issues 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area the awash river basin is one of the twelve river basins of ethiopia fig 1 a the river with a length of about 1 200 km starts from ginichi town west of the capital addis ababa travels along the rift valley and ends in lake abe on the border between ethiopia and djibouti the awash river basin comprises highlands escarpments and rift valley the awash river flows from an altitude of 3 000 m above sea level m a s l to 250 m a s l fig 1b the awash river basin is part of the great rift valley in ethiopia and covers a total area of 116 200 km2 the western catchment with the size of 70 800 km2 drains to the main awash river or its tributaries the remaining 45 400 km2 most of which comprises the so called eastern catchment drains into a desert area and does not contribute to the main river course nigussie and getaneh 2016 fig 2 a therefore only the western catchment was considered in this study figs 1a and 2 a in the ethiopian rift valley the complex tectonic and volcanic processes have resulted in the formation of volcano tectonic structural depressions that became sites for many rift valley lakes including lake beseka in the awash basin lake beseka was naturally a closed catchment currently it has inflows from abadir farm nera era and fentaile irrigation farms that are located within lake beseka catchment it has a manmade outflow channel constructed by awash basin authority awba in 2009 and 2010 near the lake the metehara sugar estate has developed farmland of about 100 km2 zeleke 2008 lake beseka has been expanding rapidly and the area has increased from 3 km2 to 40 km2 from the late 1960s and early 1970s to the early 2000s mwr 1999 the lake body was estimated about 54 km2 in 2015 using the google earth image shishaye 2015 a recent land use study showed that the lake body has reached 46 7 km2 in 2017 teffera et al 2018 the level of the lake rose by 4 m from 1976 to 1997 zemedagegnehu and egizabher 2004 in contrast to many east african terminal lakes lake beseka has been expanding drastically as a result of an increase in the net groundwater flux into the lake that may have resulted from an increase from irrigation activities in the adjacent farmland ayenew 2004 the rainfall in the awash river basin is highly variable in space and time the average total rainfall ranges from 1600 mm in the highlands to 160 mm in the lowlands awba 2017 the climate of the awash river basin comes under the influence of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz the rainfall pattern in the basin shows that the main rains occur from july to september and the rest of the year is dry except for a small amount of rainfall during march to may june is a dry month between the small and the main rainy season 2 2 inca cl application to the awash river basin the integrated catchment model inca is a dynamic daily time step semi distributed process based water quality model originally created to simulate nitrogen processes and assess sources of nitrogen in catchments wade et al 2002 whitehead et al 1998a b over the years various versions of inca models inca phosphorus inca sediment inca carbon inca metals inca pathogen and others have been developed and applied to river catchments crossman et al 2013 futter et al 2007 jackson blake et al 2016 lu et al 2017 whitehead et al 2009 2011 the inca chloride inca cl model was first used to simulate stream cl concentrations in a single stem river that treats the tributaries as aggregated inputs jin et al 2011 the recent modification to the model structure allowed it to simulate the in stream cl concentrations in dendritic stream networks gutchess et al 2018 within the inca model cl is transferred through the catchment by individual processes operating across different land use classes and a multi branched river network jin et al 2011 common sources of cl include atmospheric deposition road salting effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants and groundwater discharge gutchess et al 2018 kelly et al 2008 hydrological inputs to inca include daily time series of precipitation temperature hydrologically effective rainfall her and soil moisture deficit smd her and smd are estimated using the precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff simulator for solute transport persist model which is a conceptual daily time step semi distributed model designed primarily for use with the inca models futter et al 2014 persist simulates water fluxes from precipitation through the terrestrial part of a catchment and into rivers and it allows a broad range of user specified perceptual models of runoff generation in different climatic regions and landscape types futter et al 2014 in persist the actual et is calculated by using a similar approach to penman s potential evapotranspiration durand 2004 however instead of using penman potential et as the baseline a degree day evapotranspiration parameter is used as described by futter et al 2014 other input data to an inca model requires river network topology reach characteristics sub catchment areas and land uses daily rainfall data was acquired from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations v2 0 chirps funk et al 2015 taye et al 2018 chirps is a global dataset of rainfall that blends satellite based and gauge based rainfall estimates with a 0 05 resolution daily temperature data were obtained from a network of local weather stations both precipitation and temperature were acquired for the time period between 1981 and 2016 due to the extreme spatial variability of rainfall within the awash river basin three main areas of homogeneous climate were identified in this study upper awash middle awash and lower awash fig 2a the average daily rainfall and temperature series were computed for each of the three areas between 1981 and 2016 fig 2b and c by creating a gridded dataset 10 10 km of daily precipitation and temperature and computing the average of all the 10 10 km cells within each of the climate areas upper and middle awash have similar monthly temperature while lower awash has significantly higher temperature throughout the year fig 2b for precipitation three areas generally follow the pattern with wet seasons between june to september the inca hydrological input data daily time series of her and smd between 1981 2016 were then obtained by persist for the upper middle and lower catchments to simulate river flow and cl in inca the awash river catchment was divided into 24 sub catchments shown in fig 1 the sub catchment reach boundaries were selected at confluences effluent discharges flow stations and water quality monitoring stations sub catchments were delineated using a digital elevation model dem in arcgis which was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm jarvis et al 2008 srtm is an international research effort to obtained dems on a near global scale from 56 s to 60 n the land use information was from the globcover portal bontemps et al 2009 globcover is an esa european space agency initiative whose aim is to develop a service capable of delivering global composites and land cover maps using input observations from the 300 m meris sensor on board the envisat satellite mission the datasets cover two periods december 2004 june 2006 and january december 2009 the most updated dataset from 2009 was used in this study the percentage of each of six land use classes arable grassland mixed forest water bare urban area and reach length were also calculated for each sub catchment table 1 in arcgis which were used as inca inputs river discharge and water quality cl data are available at several stations along the main awash river managed by the awash river water authority table 1 daily flow data covers from 1960s up to 2014 at the end of the reach 5 the river goes to koka dam water quality data were collected between twice or six times annually from 2004 to 2008 and at a monthly interval from 2009 to 2013 however a few monthly samples were missing which resulted in a small number of data available based on the availability of observed flow and water quality data inca cl model calibration was conducted from 2005 to 2014 for 10 years we calibrated the model against river discharge data as well as the spatial and temporal patterns of river water cl inca model computes the daily flows and cl concentrations at all reaches along the river system and these values can be compared to observed data using r2 and the kling gupta efficiency kge to assess the quality of the model gupta et al 2009 the kge combines the three components of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of model errors i e correlation bias ratio of variances or coefficients of variation in a more balanced way and it has been widely used in hydrological model calibration in recent years gupta et al 2009 liu 2020 we also adopted the same approach as previous studies gutchess et al 2018 jin et al 2011 to select flow and cl related parameters for calibration which include baseflow index flow parameter a and b groundwater residence time direct runoff residence time and initial cl concentration as well as soil water residence time and initial cl concentration the calibrated model has selected parameter set with the highest kge values main cl inputs to the model include 1 atmospheric deposition 2 groundwater discharge and 3 domestic effluent discharge for atmospheric deposition landtschoote 2017 collected eleven rainfall samples in northern ethiopia with chloride concentrations ranging between 0 196 mg l and 1 548 mg l landtschoote 2017 an arithmetic geometric average of 0 55 mg l was used in the inca model to represent the mean atmospheric cl level groundwater cl concentrations varied widely in the awash river basin from 1 mg l up to 1 000 mg l and areal groundwater quality map was developed by nigussie and getaneh for the basin nigussie and getaneh 2016 thus different groundwater cl concentrations were assigned to each sub catchment based on the groundwater quality map specifically for sub catchment 1 2 4 5 and 6 groundwater cl were set at 10 mg l for sub catchment 7 8 16 and 24 groundwater cl were set at 100 mg l for sub catchment 9 10 and 11 groundwater cl were set at 250 mg l for sub catchment 12 and 13 groundwater cl were set at 800 mg l for sub catchment 14 15 17 18 19 20 21 22 and 23 groundwater cl were set at 30 mg l lastly the domestic effluent discharge was calculated based on the population number water usage and estimated urine cl level for each sub catchment 2 3 lake beseka and inca cl application lake beseka is located within the awash river basin central rift valley of ethiopia at about 200 km southeast of the nation s capital city addis ababa lake beseka water is characterized by a na hco3 cl type of water which is alkaline and saline due to the interaction between the geothermal waters and silicate rocks and the concentration of soluble materials as a consequence of high evaporation rates ayenew 2005 furi et al 2012 the similar hydrochemical signature of the groundwater system in the western part of the basin indicates that the groundwater inflow constitutes the major inflow to lake beseka in the form of hot springs the other major component of the lake water is the recharge from adjacent irrigation fields of the sugar farmland ayenew 2004 kebede and zewdu 2019 the recent increase in irrigation recharge has resulted in the decreasing cl concentration due to dilution over the past few decades with the expansion of lake beseka it has the potential to join the awash river in the near future thereby salinizing the river water impacting all downstream irrigation developments in the basin and the livelihood of the people depending on the water resources of the basin in order to reduce the impact some controlled regulated discharge from lake beseka into the awash river has been implemented for example the ministry of water irrigation and electricity of ethiopia mowie constructed 8 pumps to discharge lake water into the awash river at a rate of up to 1 7 m3 s starting in late 2000s and then the pumps had an unexpected operational issue wwdse 2010 the mowie and water works design and supervision enterprise wwdse tried to drain the lake water to the awash river at a rate of up to 10 m3 s by gravity flow since the end of 2011 the lack of official record of length and rate of discharge made it impossible to quantify the influence of lake beseka water on the awash river there would likely be some loss of water during the process therefore a simple cl mass balance was used to estimate the discharge from the lake using cl concentrations at locations before the lake and after the lake as a first approximation to estimate the discharge of the lake water to the awash river measured cl data in the awash river from 2010 to 2013 showed that the average cl concentration was 19 6 mg l and 37 3 mg l at reach 7 before the lake and reach 8 after the lake respectively the lake water had the average cl concentration of 430 0 mg l from 2010 to 2013 a mixing model chapra 1996 was then used to calculate the percentage of lake water input to the awash river the lake water input calculated from cl mass balance is estimated to be approximately 4 3 given the average baseflow was about 45 50 m3 s the inflow from lake beseka could be approximately 2 m3 s with cl concentrations of 430 0 mg l a one reach inca model was set up for lake beseka similar to the awash river inca setup reach characteristics land uses and hydrological input only middle catchment were obtained for the lake and surrounding catchment the lake beseka model was calibrated from 2005 to 2014 using the observed cl data from the lake climate change scenarios were run to understand the long term change of the lake chemistry data of which are also used as discharge and concentration input to the awash river model with different discharge rates e g 1 m3 s 2 m3 s and 5 m3 s when assessing the impact to the river water from lake beseka in the future 2 4 climate change scenarios in order to assess the impact of climate change to the awash river watershed the change factor method was used diaz nieto and wilby 2005 when using this method atmospheric variables precipitation and temperature were analyzed to calculate changes predicted by climate models for the study area the same changes were then applied to the input time series of the baseline climatic data from 1981 to 2016 to obtain resulting time series of altered climate for the future in this study we have adopted the change factors from taye et al taye et al 2018 which used three climate models from the coupled models inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 three future periods near future 2006 2030 mid future 2031 2055 and far future 2056 2080 and the rcp8 5 representative concentration pathway 8 5 emission scenario taye et al 2018 these three models gfdl cm3 mpi esm mr and hadgem2 ao among the cmip5 of 24 global climate models were chosen based on their ability to capture the historical precipitation characteristics in the awash basin taye et al 2018 change factors were estimated in a spatially distributed manner i e over a regular grid 0 05 x 0 05 chirps grid and on a monthly scale the grids were aggregated into upper middle and lower catchments when generating future climate data that were used as input for the inca model to obtain predictions of flow and chloride concentrations under future climate change 3 results and discussions 3 1 awash river inca flow calibration results the awash river is strongly affected by the inter tropical convergence zone itcz and shows clear seasonal pattern with high flows occurring from july to september and low flows during the rest of the year at the upper catchment peak flow could rise up to 400 m3 s and the baseflow remains less than 10 m3 s fig 3 the magnitude of the peak flow does not change significantly as the river travels downstream while the baseflow increases due to the discharge from groundwater domestic effluent and lake beseka fig 3 inca model was calibrated from 2005 to 2014 using observed daily mean flow at several flow stations within the awash river basin fig 3 shows the comparison between observed and simulated daily flow at an upper reach reach 4 and a middle reach reach 10 table 2 shows a summary of model performance statistics the overall fit has r2 values from 0 47 to 0 57 table 2 the goodness of fit indices of the model calibration which was calculated using the kling gupta efficiency kge ranges from 0 32 to 0 70 table 2 the inca model generally reproduces observed flow dynamics quite well for reach 10 flows are affected by koka dam and unregulated lake beseka input to the awash river so that the model simulation underperforms nonetheless the model adequately captured the seasonal variations of the flow and the magnitude of the rising and falling limbs fig 3 3 2 awash river salinity sources and inca cl calibration results in general the cl levels are largely controlled by mixing of low cl rainfall and high cl groundwater the effluent discharge from domestic waste also contributed cl to the river this point source became more important during low flows than during high flows the model simulation generally matches the observed seasonal variabilities of cl concentrations although in some cases cl concentrations are under estimated or over estimated fig 4 there was generally a satisfactory fit of observed and simulated monthly cl concentration and load at several monitoring stations on the main awash river table 3 for monthly cl concentration r2 and kge range from 0 03 to 0 61 and 0 03 to 0 59 respectively for monthly cl load r2 and kge range from 0 53 to 0 94 and 0 05 to 0 80 respectively table 3 an example of mean monthly load is given in fig 5 at dubti the last reach of the awash river reach 16 previous studies indicate r2 values greater than 0 5 is considered acceptable for model evaluation santhi et al 2001 van liew et al 2003 given these statistics guideline and the process based nature of the inca model which accounted for various natural and anthropogenic sources of salinity the calibrated model was adequate to capture and represent the dominating processes in the awash river basin as the awash river flows downstream cl concentrations varied greatly which reflects the main controls from groundwater discharge and point source pollution figs 6 and 7 the spatial variation of cl concentrations in groundwater from a few mg l up to 1 000 mg l nigussie and getaneh 2016 manifested itself in the spatial pattern of cl in the awash river for example the observed mean cl concentrations increased from 14 mg l at reach 5 45 mg l at reach 16 fig 6 furthermore at the middle reach e g reach 10 cl concentrations reached its highest level due to the impact from the discharge of high cl concentration water from lake beseka the spatial changes in cl along the awash river was reproduced by inca cl which gave reasonable estimates of cl concentrations although the observed cl tend to have larger variance comparing to the modeled values fig 6 along the main awash river the annual mean cl loads during the calibration period ranged from 1 5 106 to 2 0 108 kg fig 7a the area normalized annual loads varied between 1 5 103 and 6 6 103 kg km2 the annual cl loads gradually increased at the upper reaches reach 1 7 while the significant rise in annual cl loads took place at the middle reaches reach 8 9 and 10 due to the contribution of lake beseka discharge and increased groundwater discharge fig 7a after that the annual cl loads remained at approximately 2 0 108 kg in the rest of the water course fig 7a this clearly illustrates that the addition of cl load at the middle reaches have significant impact to the downstream river course by salinizing the river water impacting downstream irrigation developments and the livelihood of the people who rely on the river water as their drinking water supply when examining different sources of cl for each inca reach along the awash river upstream reaches e g reach 1 2 and 3 were dominated with groundwater discharge while the downstream reaches e g reach 14 15 and 16 primary cl load came from the prior reach fig 7b the contribution from the domestic effluent to annual cl load is apparent in reach 2 where the city of addis ababa is located fig 7b for reach 8 where lake beseka is discharged into lake water and domestic effluent consists almost 10 of annual cl load in the river for the entire catchment 2 7 of annual cl load is estimated to be from atmospheric deposition and 6 1 of annual cl load is from point source pollution including domestic effluent and lake beseka discharge the rest comes from groundwater discharge which contributes a large portion of cl load 3 3 lake beseka model results the chemistry of lake beseka water has been constantly changing and leading to the reduction of cl concentration this variation is related to increase in the inflow due to over irrigation in the lake catchment the cl concentration in the lake water was about 600 mg l in 2005 and declined almost 1 3 400 mg l in 2013 fig 8 fig 8 illustrates that inca model was able to simulate the dilution of chloride concentration and the long term declining trend in the lake water from 2005 to 2014 when comparing the observed monthly cl concentrations from the lake with the inca simulated values the little variation of daily cl concentration is due to the long residence time of lake beseka based on the length of the lake 12 km and the average discharge of the lake 2 m3 s the lake water residence time which is equal to the lake volume divided by discharge is calculated to be approximately 15 years the residence time is important as it controls the degree of mixing in the lake and thereby the salinity dynamics this then controls how long salinity levels will change and more importantly how long salinity levels might take to fall to acceptable concentrations the major issue of concern with lake beseka is that the lake levels are still rising and at some point the lake flow will have to be directed into the awash river as the lake water is saline there is a serious concern that the impacts on the awash downstream might be severe causing the restricted use of water for both drinking supplies and irrigation this would create some major issues for the management of the awash river system 3 4 climate change impact to the awash river and lake beseka three time periods near future mid future and far future of climate change impact were analyzed using calibrated awash river and lake beseka models monthly mean temperature is projected to increase 0 3 1 0 c 0 8 1 5 c and 1 3 2 2 c in the near future mid future and far future respectively compared to baseline condition 1981 2016 summer months june to september tend to have greater increases in temperature than the rest of the year future changes of precipitation vary greatly among different months monthly mean precipitation is projected to change from 0 3 to 1 0 mm day 0 9 to1 3 mm day 1 0 1 7 mm day in the near future mid future and far future respectively compared to baseline condition 1981 2016 for the awash river without lake water input high flows july to october at the last reach would be reduced in all three future periods up to 25 compared to the baseline period fig 9 the flows were projected to continue to decrease from near future to far future this is due to combined effects from the future changes of temperature and precipitation patterns during the low flow periods january june and november to december there are mixed results with the increases and decreases in flows in general january february november and december showed increasing trends into the future while march to june likely have decreasing flows the decreasing trend during the low flow periods could likely worsen the issues of water shortage and water security for domestic and agricultural consumptions changes in future cl concentration in the awash river are less significant than the flow without the influence from lake beseka the increases are up to 11 mixed with less than 5 decreases in cl at the final reach of the awash river fig 9 the changing cl concentrations mainly reflect the future rainfall and flow shifts in the river system for beseka lake the cl concentration level was measured at approximately 400 mg l in 2013 which fell in the severe restriction of the irrigation water use 355 mg l nigussie and getaneh 2016 models using future climate projections indicate the current declining trend would continue into the future long term lake water quality could be largely impacted by extremely heavy rainfall events which would dilute the lake overall iconic concentrations including cl under the current modeling circumstance and projected future climate the mean cl of the lake water will likely reach 250 mg l which is the ethiopia drinking water quality requirement and the national secondary drinking water regulations from environmental protection agency in the usa at the year of 2025 fig 10 this reduction of cl would potentially lessen the irrigation water restriction from severe to slight moderate cl concentrations between 142 355 mg l nigussie and getaneh 2016 3 5 combined impact to the awash river from climate change and lake beseka discharge due to the growing concern of the expansion of lake beseka and its negative impact to the awash river water and the downstream irrigation developments regulating lake beseka water and manually transferring it into the awash river at a controlled rate was proposed help mitigate the issue in the last decade teffera et al 2018 if this continues at the current rate 2 m3 s into the future cl concentration would rise to a much higher level with nearly 20 increases than the baseline condition at the last reach fig 11 the changes between baseline and future scenarios are greater during low flows than that during high flows due to less dilution in addition it is worth noting that the impact is much more significant to the area immediate downstream from lake beseka for example at reach 8 immediately after lake beseka discharge cl concentrations could be elevated to about 50 mg l which is approximately 70 increase in the low flow months comparing to the baseline condition fig 11 therefore the human activities e g irrigation are clearly going to affect the awash river water quality by discharging lake beseka water different discharge rates e g 1 m3 s 2 m3 s and 5 m3 s from lake beseka were also explored to assess its impact to the awash river water quality less inflow from lake beseka to the awash river result in less increases in cl concentrations along the awash river for example with the discharge rate of 1 m3 s from the lake cl concentrations in the awash river are expected to increase about 40 and 10 compared to the baseline period in the near future 2006 2030 at reach 8 and reach 16 respectively with much higher discharge rate from lake beseka 5 m3 s cl concentrations would rise substantially at reach 8 which is immediately downstream from the lake nearly 200 increase at reach 8 is possible during low flows in the near future fig 12 the changes however become less significant into far future 2056 2080 as the cl concentration in lake beseka continue to decline over time and its impact would become less fig 12 as lake beseka water contains high concentration of cl discharge into the awash river would inevitably increase the cl concentrations in the awash river long term uses of high salinity water for irrigation would leave salt behind in the soil and lead to soil salinization dinka 2017 3 6 model uncertainty and study limitations a catchment modeling study inevitably involves uncertainty as the models only represent simplifications of reality and would never exactly reproduce flow and water quality dynamics jakeman et al 1993 wade et al 2008 wilby 2005 however it is possible to create models that capture the long term trends and main hydrologic hydrochemical dynamics with the awareness of model uncertainty it is recognized that this inca modeling study has a number of sources of uncertainty that are associated with future projections of flow and cl concentrations one area of the uncertainty comes from the choices of the climate change scenarios this work used three climate models from the cmip5 ensemble for the region that produced good predications of historical flow under rcp8 5 scenario worse case scenario taye et al 2018 thus it is important to be informed that the outcomes of the future flow and cl concentrations from this study do not represent the full range of future projections another area of uncertainty is associated with input and parametrization of inca modeling for example an arithmetic geometric average of cl concentrations from eleven rainfall samples in northern ethiopia was used as an input in the model for the entire awash basin landtschoote 2017 the spatial variations of cl pattern may affect the model performance another inca input of uncertainty is the domestic effluent discharge which was calculated based on human population in each sub catchment the effluent discharge estimates did not account for population change over time as the domestic effluent only contributes a small percentage of cl to the annual load 1 5 in the study area except reach 1 and 2 the population change during the modelling period is not anticipated to change the results significantly in addition a fixed groundwater cl concentration for each sub catchment was applied in the model because rapid and drastic groundwater cl concentration changes across the basin were not expected given the large portion of annual cl load comes from groundwater discharge a good management and monitoring plan for the regional groundwater resources would be important while models are helpful to project future changes in water quality the accuracy of input parameter values and model output should be viewed cautiously in this study a limited number of flow stations and infrequent water quality sampling pose another uncertainty as model calibration was conducted by comparing observed flow and cl concentration with simulated values uncertainty increases with fewer flow and water quality analysis to reduce this uncertainty we focused our calibration effort on the sensitive parameters e g flow velocity parameters groundwater residence time baseflow index direct runoff residence time and initial cl concentration as well as soil water residence time and initial cl concentration that were identified by previous inca studies dean et al 2009 gutchess et al 2018 jin et al 2011 mcintyre et al 2005 wade et al 2001 wilby 2005 and carefully calibrated these parameters by comparing the simulated results to observed values and achieving highest r2 and kge as there is no flow station in the lower awash river basin great care must be taken in interpreting the results of flows in that region regarding the infrequent water quality sampling it is common to have good record of daily flow measurement while water quality analyses are infrequent e g monthly or quarterly because of that we chose not to divide the cl dataset into two for model calibration and validation which would cause too few data for each process although no validation was performed the available cl data were used to calibrate the model and ensure the model capture the main dynamics of the river system limited data availability should not hinder the use of the models as the process based models still remain as the best available approach of understanding the catchment process to the possible future conditions this is the first study to assess the sources of the awash river salinity and analyze the impact from climate change to the river water quality comprehensive water quality monitoring program in the awash river basin is recommended as it will greatly support modeling applications that provide valuable information for catchment managers and policy makers future monitoring program should not only include flow measurement at the lower awash river basin but also frequent water quality sampling from both the rivers and groundwater across the basin 4 conclusions water quality management is a critical component of water resources water quality deterioration from point and non point sources is of great concern in the awash river basin due to the diverse polluting activities and its economic significance sources of salinity come from both natural processes high saline lake beseka and groundwater and anthropogenic activities effluent discharge and lake beseka discharge this paper uses a multi branched integrated catchment model that incorporates major physical processes to simulate cl concentration in the awash river and lake beseka this is the first study that has tried to integrate the whole awash river system and lake beseka results show that under climate change peak flow would reduce in three future periods up to 25 comparing with the baseline period mixed results of increasing and decreasing flows are projected during low flow months january june and november to december which may reduce clean water availability as for cl without considering the discharge from lake beseka changes in cl concentrations are insignificant and mostly reflect the flow changes however with high discharge rates from lake beseka cl concentration could rise as much as nearly 200 in the near future in the awash river water immediately downstream from the lake during low flow conditions the modeling results clearly showed the impact of the human interference and climate change to the awash river the water quality in the awash river will continue to be affected by both natural process and anthropogenic activities while modeling study provides insights into future conditions that is valuable for planners and local stakeholders to support strategic decision making continued water quality monitoring in both the awash river and lake beseka with integrated basin wide water management practice is essential for future water resources management author statement conceptualization li jin paul whitehead katrina charles methodology li jin paul whitehead

8209,study region awash river basin ethiopia study focus many river basins in sub saharan africa have become vulnerable due to the impact from climate change weak governance and high levels of poverty one of the primary concerns is the elevated salinity and the degradation of water quality in the awash river located in the great rift valley in ethiopia the awash river has unique hydrochemistry due to water rock interactions however in recent years increasing anthropogenic activities including the discharge from saline lake beseka into the awash river has caused some concern this study used an integrated catchment model to simulate chloride concentration in the awash river basin by taking both natural and anthropogenic sources of salinity into consideration future scenarios of climate change and lake beseka discharge were examined to assess the impact to the river water quality new hydrologic insights results show that lake beseka has made significant contribution to the rise of the salinity in the awash river if the trend of human interference e g increased irrigation and unregulated water transfer continues the river downstream of lake beseka could see cl increases up to 200 in the near future 2006 2030 the modeling results are essential for generating long term plans for proper utilization of water resources especially in the region where the resources and the economic capacity to meet the water demand is lacking keywords salinity chloride lake beseka climate change 1 introduction water scarcity is one of the most pressing environmental and societal issues worldwide and affects human health food security and ecosystem that potentially lead to mass migration brzoska and fröhlich 2016 gray and mueller 2012 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 in sub saharan africa there are many vulnerable river basins due to the impact from climate change weak governance and high levels of poverty hirpa et al 2019 taye et al 2018 the awash river basin is one area of concern as the catchment is subject to not only high climatic variability with frequent floods and droughts but also the impact of the rapid growth of agriculture industries and urbanization as well as population growth within the awash basin taye et al 2018 all of these have placed excessive pressures on the basin s water resources in addition the decreases in flow reduce the dilution power in the river system the growing human population and the expansion of industrial and agricultural activities have contributed point source and non point source pollutions to the awash river that inevitably degrade the water quality bussi et al 2021 nigussie and getaneh 2016 the hydrochemistry of the awash river basin is unique and characterized as wide spatial variations in total dissolved solids tds and ionic concentrations due to differences in water rock interactions related to geology groundwater residence time geomorphological setting and climate ayenew 2005 darling et al 1996 in general the highland waters are homogeneous and characterized by lower tds 50 1200 mg l with the dominantly calcium magnesium bicarbonate type ayenew 2005 the tds increases towards the rift valley following the regional groundwater flow directions from areas of high rainfall and low evaporation to the semi arid rift floor the rift valley waters are dominantly sodium bicarbonate type with high tds 200 and 73 000 mg l and enriched fluoride ayenew 2005 ayenew et al 2008 this chemical feature of varied tds is evident in the awash river basin where bicarbonate dominates the upper awash water and changes to high chloride cl type in the middle and low awash river due to changes in lithology related to evaporite deposit ayenew 2005 in addition lake beseka located within the awash river basin is an exceptional lake that was extremely saline in 1960s with the cl concentration of over 5 000 mg l due to its unique geological and hydrogeological settings olumana dinka 2017 talling and talling 1965 since then substantial increase in lake volume area and depth has been observed there is concern that the continued growth of lake beseka from increased groundwater inflow to the lake resulting from an increase from irrigation activities would eventually make lake beseka cross the awash river catchment boundary and join the river that could result in numerous negative environmental and economic consequences dinka 2017 high salinity of lake beseka water would significantly impact the river water chemistry and put another pressure to the already stressed water resources it could also affect the groundwater system and the aquatic ecosystem downstream the rise in salinity of the river water could affect the large fertile irrigated farmlands located downstream with soil salinization dinka 2017 this situation is a serious threat to the socio economic stability of the entire awash river basin and it requires regular monitoring and an appropriate management system various organizations including the ministry of water irrigation and electricity of ethiopia mowie have tried to control the lake level since the early 2010s by setting up pumps excavating a canal and discharging the lake water into the river teffera et al 2018 wwdse 2010 however a comprehensive assessment is still needed to understand the impact to the downstream water quality from mixing the lake beseka water with the river water in this paper the influence of human factors in combination with the natural conditions of climate and geology on the water quality in the region will be examined we will use an integrated catchment model to simulate chloride concentration in the awash river basin including lake beseka considering both natural and anthropogenic sources of salinity future scenarios including climate change and the discharge of lake beseka water into the awash river will be analyzed this is the first study that uses a semi distributed model application to assess the river flow lake beseka discharge and its impact on river water quality in a holistic way in the awash river basin understanding the impact from climate change and increased anthropogenic activities is needed to set up suitable water management policies and regulate the uses of water resources in the awash river basin this study also provides insights into river basin management for other places that face similar issues 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area the awash river basin is one of the twelve river basins of ethiopia fig 1 a the river with a length of about 1 200 km starts from ginichi town west of the capital addis ababa travels along the rift valley and ends in lake abe on the border between ethiopia and djibouti the awash river basin comprises highlands escarpments and rift valley the awash river flows from an altitude of 3 000 m above sea level m a s l to 250 m a s l fig 1b the awash river basin is part of the great rift valley in ethiopia and covers a total area of 116 200 km2 the western catchment with the size of 70 800 km2 drains to the main awash river or its tributaries the remaining 45 400 km2 most of which comprises the so called eastern catchment drains into a desert area and does not contribute to the main river course nigussie and getaneh 2016 fig 2 a therefore only the western catchment was considered in this study figs 1a and 2 a in the ethiopian rift valley the complex tectonic and volcanic processes have resulted in the formation of volcano tectonic structural depressions that became sites for many rift valley lakes including lake beseka in the awash basin lake beseka was naturally a closed catchment currently it has inflows from abadir farm nera era and fentaile irrigation farms that are located within lake beseka catchment it has a manmade outflow channel constructed by awash basin authority awba in 2009 and 2010 near the lake the metehara sugar estate has developed farmland of about 100 km2 zeleke 2008 lake beseka has been expanding rapidly and the area has increased from 3 km2 to 40 km2 from the late 1960s and early 1970s to the early 2000s mwr 1999 the lake body was estimated about 54 km2 in 2015 using the google earth image shishaye 2015 a recent land use study showed that the lake body has reached 46 7 km2 in 2017 teffera et al 2018 the level of the lake rose by 4 m from 1976 to 1997 zemedagegnehu and egizabher 2004 in contrast to many east african terminal lakes lake beseka has been expanding drastically as a result of an increase in the net groundwater flux into the lake that may have resulted from an increase from irrigation activities in the adjacent farmland ayenew 2004 the rainfall in the awash river basin is highly variable in space and time the average total rainfall ranges from 1600 mm in the highlands to 160 mm in the lowlands awba 2017 the climate of the awash river basin comes under the influence of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz the rainfall pattern in the basin shows that the main rains occur from july to september and the rest of the year is dry except for a small amount of rainfall during march to may june is a dry month between the small and the main rainy season 2 2 inca cl application to the awash river basin the integrated catchment model inca is a dynamic daily time step semi distributed process based water quality model originally created to simulate nitrogen processes and assess sources of nitrogen in catchments wade et al 2002 whitehead et al 1998a b over the years various versions of inca models inca phosphorus inca sediment inca carbon inca metals inca pathogen and others have been developed and applied to river catchments crossman et al 2013 futter et al 2007 jackson blake et al 2016 lu et al 2017 whitehead et al 2009 2011 the inca chloride inca cl model was first used to simulate stream cl concentrations in a single stem river that treats the tributaries as aggregated inputs jin et al 2011 the recent modification to the model structure allowed it to simulate the in stream cl concentrations in dendritic stream networks gutchess et al 2018 within the inca model cl is transferred through the catchment by individual processes operating across different land use classes and a multi branched river network jin et al 2011 common sources of cl include atmospheric deposition road salting effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants and groundwater discharge gutchess et al 2018 kelly et al 2008 hydrological inputs to inca include daily time series of precipitation temperature hydrologically effective rainfall her and soil moisture deficit smd her and smd are estimated using the precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff simulator for solute transport persist model which is a conceptual daily time step semi distributed model designed primarily for use with the inca models futter et al 2014 persist simulates water fluxes from precipitation through the terrestrial part of a catchment and into rivers and it allows a broad range of user specified perceptual models of runoff generation in different climatic regions and landscape types futter et al 2014 in persist the actual et is calculated by using a similar approach to penman s potential evapotranspiration durand 2004 however instead of using penman potential et as the baseline a degree day evapotranspiration parameter is used as described by futter et al 2014 other input data to an inca model requires river network topology reach characteristics sub catchment areas and land uses daily rainfall data was acquired from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations v2 0 chirps funk et al 2015 taye et al 2018 chirps is a global dataset of rainfall that blends satellite based and gauge based rainfall estimates with a 0 05 resolution daily temperature data were obtained from a network of local weather stations both precipitation and temperature were acquired for the time period between 1981 and 2016 due to the extreme spatial variability of rainfall within the awash river basin three main areas of homogeneous climate were identified in this study upper awash middle awash and lower awash fig 2a the average daily rainfall and temperature series were computed for each of the three areas between 1981 and 2016 fig 2b and c by creating a gridded dataset 10 10 km of daily precipitation and temperature and computing the average of all the 10 10 km cells within each of the climate areas upper and middle awash have similar monthly temperature while lower awash has significantly higher temperature throughout the year fig 2b for precipitation three areas generally follow the pattern with wet seasons between june to september the inca hydrological input data daily time series of her and smd between 1981 2016 were then obtained by persist for the upper middle and lower catchments to simulate river flow and cl in inca the awash river catchment was divided into 24 sub catchments shown in fig 1 the sub catchment reach boundaries were selected at confluences effluent discharges flow stations and water quality monitoring stations sub catchments were delineated using a digital elevation model dem in arcgis which was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm jarvis et al 2008 srtm is an international research effort to obtained dems on a near global scale from 56 s to 60 n the land use information was from the globcover portal bontemps et al 2009 globcover is an esa european space agency initiative whose aim is to develop a service capable of delivering global composites and land cover maps using input observations from the 300 m meris sensor on board the envisat satellite mission the datasets cover two periods december 2004 june 2006 and january december 2009 the most updated dataset from 2009 was used in this study the percentage of each of six land use classes arable grassland mixed forest water bare urban area and reach length were also calculated for each sub catchment table 1 in arcgis which were used as inca inputs river discharge and water quality cl data are available at several stations along the main awash river managed by the awash river water authority table 1 daily flow data covers from 1960s up to 2014 at the end of the reach 5 the river goes to koka dam water quality data were collected between twice or six times annually from 2004 to 2008 and at a monthly interval from 2009 to 2013 however a few monthly samples were missing which resulted in a small number of data available based on the availability of observed flow and water quality data inca cl model calibration was conducted from 2005 to 2014 for 10 years we calibrated the model against river discharge data as well as the spatial and temporal patterns of river water cl inca model computes the daily flows and cl concentrations at all reaches along the river system and these values can be compared to observed data using r2 and the kling gupta efficiency kge to assess the quality of the model gupta et al 2009 the kge combines the three components of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of model errors i e correlation bias ratio of variances or coefficients of variation in a more balanced way and it has been widely used in hydrological model calibration in recent years gupta et al 2009 liu 2020 we also adopted the same approach as previous studies gutchess et al 2018 jin et al 2011 to select flow and cl related parameters for calibration which include baseflow index flow parameter a and b groundwater residence time direct runoff residence time and initial cl concentration as well as soil water residence time and initial cl concentration the calibrated model has selected parameter set with the highest kge values main cl inputs to the model include 1 atmospheric deposition 2 groundwater discharge and 3 domestic effluent discharge for atmospheric deposition landtschoote 2017 collected eleven rainfall samples in northern ethiopia with chloride concentrations ranging between 0 196 mg l and 1 548 mg l landtschoote 2017 an arithmetic geometric average of 0 55 mg l was used in the inca model to represent the mean atmospheric cl level groundwater cl concentrations varied widely in the awash river basin from 1 mg l up to 1 000 mg l and areal groundwater quality map was developed by nigussie and getaneh for the basin nigussie and getaneh 2016 thus different groundwater cl concentrations were assigned to each sub catchment based on the groundwater quality map specifically for sub catchment 1 2 4 5 and 6 groundwater cl were set at 10 mg l for sub catchment 7 8 16 and 24 groundwater cl were set at 100 mg l for sub catchment 9 10 and 11 groundwater cl were set at 250 mg l for sub catchment 12 and 13 groundwater cl were set at 800 mg l for sub catchment 14 15 17 18 19 20 21 22 and 23 groundwater cl were set at 30 mg l lastly the domestic effluent discharge was calculated based on the population number water usage and estimated urine cl level for each sub catchment 2 3 lake beseka and inca cl application lake beseka is located within the awash river basin central rift valley of ethiopia at about 200 km southeast of the nation s capital city addis ababa lake beseka water is characterized by a na hco3 cl type of water which is alkaline and saline due to the interaction between the geothermal waters and silicate rocks and the concentration of soluble materials as a consequence of high evaporation rates ayenew 2005 furi et al 2012 the similar hydrochemical signature of the groundwater system in the western part of the basin indicates that the groundwater inflow constitutes the major inflow to lake beseka in the form of hot springs the other major component of the lake water is the recharge from adjacent irrigation fields of the sugar farmland ayenew 2004 kebede and zewdu 2019 the recent increase in irrigation recharge has resulted in the decreasing cl concentration due to dilution over the past few decades with the expansion of lake beseka it has the potential to join the awash river in the near future thereby salinizing the river water impacting all downstream irrigation developments in the basin and the livelihood of the people depending on the water resources of the basin in order to reduce the impact some controlled regulated discharge from lake beseka into the awash river has been implemented for example the ministry of water irrigation and electricity of ethiopia mowie constructed 8 pumps to discharge lake water into the awash river at a rate of up to 1 7 m3 s starting in late 2000s and then the pumps had an unexpected operational issue wwdse 2010 the mowie and water works design and supervision enterprise wwdse tried to drain the lake water to the awash river at a rate of up to 10 m3 s by gravity flow since the end of 2011 the lack of official record of length and rate of discharge made it impossible to quantify the influence of lake beseka water on the awash river there would likely be some loss of water during the process therefore a simple cl mass balance was used to estimate the discharge from the lake using cl concentrations at locations before the lake and after the lake as a first approximation to estimate the discharge of the lake water to the awash river measured cl data in the awash river from 2010 to 2013 showed that the average cl concentration was 19 6 mg l and 37 3 mg l at reach 7 before the lake and reach 8 after the lake respectively the lake water had the average cl concentration of 430 0 mg l from 2010 to 2013 a mixing model chapra 1996 was then used to calculate the percentage of lake water input to the awash river the lake water input calculated from cl mass balance is estimated to be approximately 4 3 given the average baseflow was about 45 50 m3 s the inflow from lake beseka could be approximately 2 m3 s with cl concentrations of 430 0 mg l a one reach inca model was set up for lake beseka similar to the awash river inca setup reach characteristics land uses and hydrological input only middle catchment were obtained for the lake and surrounding catchment the lake beseka model was calibrated from 2005 to 2014 using the observed cl data from the lake climate change scenarios were run to understand the long term change of the lake chemistry data of which are also used as discharge and concentration input to the awash river model with different discharge rates e g 1 m3 s 2 m3 s and 5 m3 s when assessing the impact to the river water from lake beseka in the future 2 4 climate change scenarios in order to assess the impact of climate change to the awash river watershed the change factor method was used diaz nieto and wilby 2005 when using this method atmospheric variables precipitation and temperature were analyzed to calculate changes predicted by climate models for the study area the same changes were then applied to the input time series of the baseline climatic data from 1981 to 2016 to obtain resulting time series of altered climate for the future in this study we have adopted the change factors from taye et al taye et al 2018 which used three climate models from the coupled models inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 three future periods near future 2006 2030 mid future 2031 2055 and far future 2056 2080 and the rcp8 5 representative concentration pathway 8 5 emission scenario taye et al 2018 these three models gfdl cm3 mpi esm mr and hadgem2 ao among the cmip5 of 24 global climate models were chosen based on their ability to capture the historical precipitation characteristics in the awash basin taye et al 2018 change factors were estimated in a spatially distributed manner i e over a regular grid 0 05 x 0 05 chirps grid and on a monthly scale the grids were aggregated into upper middle and lower catchments when generating future climate data that were used as input for the inca model to obtain predictions of flow and chloride concentrations under future climate change 3 results and discussions 3 1 awash river inca flow calibration results the awash river is strongly affected by the inter tropical convergence zone itcz and shows clear seasonal pattern with high flows occurring from july to september and low flows during the rest of the year at the upper catchment peak flow could rise up to 400 m3 s and the baseflow remains less than 10 m3 s fig 3 the magnitude of the peak flow does not change significantly as the river travels downstream while the baseflow increases due to the discharge from groundwater domestic effluent and lake beseka fig 3 inca model was calibrated from 2005 to 2014 using observed daily mean flow at several flow stations within the awash river basin fig 3 shows the comparison between observed and simulated daily flow at an upper reach reach 4 and a middle reach reach 10 table 2 shows a summary of model performance statistics the overall fit has r2 values from 0 47 to 0 57 table 2 the goodness of fit indices of the model calibration which was calculated using the kling gupta efficiency kge ranges from 0 32 to 0 70 table 2 the inca model generally reproduces observed flow dynamics quite well for reach 10 flows are affected by koka dam and unregulated lake beseka input to the awash river so that the model simulation underperforms nonetheless the model adequately captured the seasonal variations of the flow and the magnitude of the rising and falling limbs fig 3 3 2 awash river salinity sources and inca cl calibration results in general the cl levels are largely controlled by mixing of low cl rainfall and high cl groundwater the effluent discharge from domestic waste also contributed cl to the river this point source became more important during low flows than during high flows the model simulation generally matches the observed seasonal variabilities of cl concentrations although in some cases cl concentrations are under estimated or over estimated fig 4 there was generally a satisfactory fit of observed and simulated monthly cl concentration and load at several monitoring stations on the main awash river table 3 for monthly cl concentration r2 and kge range from 0 03 to 0 61 and 0 03 to 0 59 respectively for monthly cl load r2 and kge range from 0 53 to 0 94 and 0 05 to 0 80 respectively table 3 an example of mean monthly load is given in fig 5 at dubti the last reach of the awash river reach 16 previous studies indicate r2 values greater than 0 5 is considered acceptable for model evaluation santhi et al 2001 van liew et al 2003 given these statistics guideline and the process based nature of the inca model which accounted for various natural and anthropogenic sources of salinity the calibrated model was adequate to capture and represent the dominating processes in the awash river basin as the awash river flows downstream cl concentrations varied greatly which reflects the main controls from groundwater discharge and point source pollution figs 6 and 7 the spatial variation of cl concentrations in groundwater from a few mg l up to 1 000 mg l nigussie and getaneh 2016 manifested itself in the spatial pattern of cl in the awash river for example the observed mean cl concentrations increased from 14 mg l at reach 5 45 mg l at reach 16 fig 6 furthermore at the middle reach e g reach 10 cl concentrations reached its highest level due to the impact from the discharge of high cl concentration water from lake beseka the spatial changes in cl along the awash river was reproduced by inca cl which gave reasonable estimates of cl concentrations although the observed cl tend to have larger variance comparing to the modeled values fig 6 along the main awash river the annual mean cl loads during the calibration period ranged from 1 5 106 to 2 0 108 kg fig 7a the area normalized annual loads varied between 1 5 103 and 6 6 103 kg km2 the annual cl loads gradually increased at the upper reaches reach 1 7 while the significant rise in annual cl loads took place at the middle reaches reach 8 9 and 10 due to the contribution of lake beseka discharge and increased groundwater discharge fig 7a after that the annual cl loads remained at approximately 2 0 108 kg in the rest of the water course fig 7a this clearly illustrates that the addition of cl load at the middle reaches have significant impact to the downstream river course by salinizing the river water impacting downstream irrigation developments and the livelihood of the people who rely on the river water as their drinking water supply when examining different sources of cl for each inca reach along the awash river upstream reaches e g reach 1 2 and 3 were dominated with groundwater discharge while the downstream reaches e g reach 14 15 and 16 primary cl load came from the prior reach fig 7b the contribution from the domestic effluent to annual cl load is apparent in reach 2 where the city of addis ababa is located fig 7b for reach 8 where lake beseka is discharged into lake water and domestic effluent consists almost 10 of annual cl load in the river for the entire catchment 2 7 of annual cl load is estimated to be from atmospheric deposition and 6 1 of annual cl load is from point source pollution including domestic effluent and lake beseka discharge the rest comes from groundwater discharge which contributes a large portion of cl load 3 3 lake beseka model results the chemistry of lake beseka water has been constantly changing and leading to the reduction of cl concentration this variation is related to increase in the inflow due to over irrigation in the lake catchment the cl concentration in the lake water was about 600 mg l in 2005 and declined almost 1 3 400 mg l in 2013 fig 8 fig 8 illustrates that inca model was able to simulate the dilution of chloride concentration and the long term declining trend in the lake water from 2005 to 2014 when comparing the observed monthly cl concentrations from the lake with the inca simulated values the little variation of daily cl concentration is due to the long residence time of lake beseka based on the length of the lake 12 km and the average discharge of the lake 2 m3 s the lake water residence time which is equal to the lake volume divided by discharge is calculated to be approximately 15 years the residence time is important as it controls the degree of mixing in the lake and thereby the salinity dynamics this then controls how long salinity levels will change and more importantly how long salinity levels might take to fall to acceptable concentrations the major issue of concern with lake beseka is that the lake levels are still rising and at some point the lake flow will have to be directed into the awash river as the lake water is saline there is a serious concern that the impacts on the awash downstream might be severe causing the restricted use of water for both drinking supplies and irrigation this would create some major issues for the management of the awash river system 3 4 climate change impact to the awash river and lake beseka three time periods near future mid future and far future of climate change impact were analyzed using calibrated awash river and lake beseka models monthly mean temperature is projected to increase 0 3 1 0 c 0 8 1 5 c and 1 3 2 2 c in the near future mid future and far future respectively compared to baseline condition 1981 2016 summer months june to september tend to have greater increases in temperature than the rest of the year future changes of precipitation vary greatly among different months monthly mean precipitation is projected to change from 0 3 to 1 0 mm day 0 9 to1 3 mm day 1 0 1 7 mm day in the near future mid future and far future respectively compared to baseline condition 1981 2016 for the awash river without lake water input high flows july to october at the last reach would be reduced in all three future periods up to 25 compared to the baseline period fig 9 the flows were projected to continue to decrease from near future to far future this is due to combined effects from the future changes of temperature and precipitation patterns during the low flow periods january june and november to december there are mixed results with the increases and decreases in flows in general january february november and december showed increasing trends into the future while march to june likely have decreasing flows the decreasing trend during the low flow periods could likely worsen the issues of water shortage and water security for domestic and agricultural consumptions changes in future cl concentration in the awash river are less significant than the flow without the influence from lake beseka the increases are up to 11 mixed with less than 5 decreases in cl at the final reach of the awash river fig 9 the changing cl concentrations mainly reflect the future rainfall and flow shifts in the river system for beseka lake the cl concentration level was measured at approximately 400 mg l in 2013 which fell in the severe restriction of the irrigation water use 355 mg l nigussie and getaneh 2016 models using future climate projections indicate the current declining trend would continue into the future long term lake water quality could be largely impacted by extremely heavy rainfall events which would dilute the lake overall iconic concentrations including cl under the current modeling circumstance and projected future climate the mean cl of the lake water will likely reach 250 mg l which is the ethiopia drinking water quality requirement and the national secondary drinking water regulations from environmental protection agency in the usa at the year of 2025 fig 10 this reduction of cl would potentially lessen the irrigation water restriction from severe to slight moderate cl concentrations between 142 355 mg l nigussie and getaneh 2016 3 5 combined impact to the awash river from climate change and lake beseka discharge due to the growing concern of the expansion of lake beseka and its negative impact to the awash river water and the downstream irrigation developments regulating lake beseka water and manually transferring it into the awash river at a controlled rate was proposed help mitigate the issue in the last decade teffera et al 2018 if this continues at the current rate 2 m3 s into the future cl concentration would rise to a much higher level with nearly 20 increases than the baseline condition at the last reach fig 11 the changes between baseline and future scenarios are greater during low flows than that during high flows due to less dilution in addition it is worth noting that the impact is much more significant to the area immediate downstream from lake beseka for example at reach 8 immediately after lake beseka discharge cl concentrations could be elevated to about 50 mg l which is approximately 70 increase in the low flow months comparing to the baseline condition fig 11 therefore the human activities e g irrigation are clearly going to affect the awash river water quality by discharging lake beseka water different discharge rates e g 1 m3 s 2 m3 s and 5 m3 s from lake beseka were also explored to assess its impact to the awash river water quality less inflow from lake beseka to the awash river result in less increases in cl concentrations along the awash river for example with the discharge rate of 1 m3 s from the lake cl concentrations in the awash river are expected to increase about 40 and 10 compared to the baseline period in the near future 2006 2030 at reach 8 and reach 16 respectively with much higher discharge rate from lake beseka 5 m3 s cl concentrations would rise substantially at reach 8 which is immediately downstream from the lake nearly 200 increase at reach 8 is possible during low flows in the near future fig 12 the changes however become less significant into far future 2056 2080 as the cl concentration in lake beseka continue to decline over time and its impact would become less fig 12 as lake beseka water contains high concentration of cl discharge into the awash river would inevitably increase the cl concentrations in the awash river long term uses of high salinity water for irrigation would leave salt behind in the soil and lead to soil salinization dinka 2017 3 6 model uncertainty and study limitations a catchment modeling study inevitably involves uncertainty as the models only represent simplifications of reality and would never exactly reproduce flow and water quality dynamics jakeman et al 1993 wade et al 2008 wilby 2005 however it is possible to create models that capture the long term trends and main hydrologic hydrochemical dynamics with the awareness of model uncertainty it is recognized that this inca modeling study has a number of sources of uncertainty that are associated with future projections of flow and cl concentrations one area of the uncertainty comes from the choices of the climate change scenarios this work used three climate models from the cmip5 ensemble for the region that produced good predications of historical flow under rcp8 5 scenario worse case scenario taye et al 2018 thus it is important to be informed that the outcomes of the future flow and cl concentrations from this study do not represent the full range of future projections another area of uncertainty is associated with input and parametrization of inca modeling for example an arithmetic geometric average of cl concentrations from eleven rainfall samples in northern ethiopia was used as an input in the model for the entire awash basin landtschoote 2017 the spatial variations of cl pattern may affect the model performance another inca input of uncertainty is the domestic effluent discharge which was calculated based on human population in each sub catchment the effluent discharge estimates did not account for population change over time as the domestic effluent only contributes a small percentage of cl to the annual load 1 5 in the study area except reach 1 and 2 the population change during the modelling period is not anticipated to change the results significantly in addition a fixed groundwater cl concentration for each sub catchment was applied in the model because rapid and drastic groundwater cl concentration changes across the basin were not expected given the large portion of annual cl load comes from groundwater discharge a good management and monitoring plan for the regional groundwater resources would be important while models are helpful to project future changes in water quality the accuracy of input parameter values and model output should be viewed cautiously in this study a limited number of flow stations and infrequent water quality sampling pose another uncertainty as model calibration was conducted by comparing observed flow and cl concentration with simulated values uncertainty increases with fewer flow and water quality analysis to reduce this uncertainty we focused our calibration effort on the sensitive parameters e g flow velocity parameters groundwater residence time baseflow index direct runoff residence time and initial cl concentration as well as soil water residence time and initial cl concentration that were identified by previous inca studies dean et al 2009 gutchess et al 2018 jin et al 2011 mcintyre et al 2005 wade et al 2001 wilby 2005 and carefully calibrated these parameters by comparing the simulated results to observed values and achieving highest r2 and kge as there is no flow station in the lower awash river basin great care must be taken in interpreting the results of flows in that region regarding the infrequent water quality sampling it is common to have good record of daily flow measurement while water quality analyses are infrequent e g monthly or quarterly because of that we chose not to divide the cl dataset into two for model calibration and validation which would cause too few data for each process although no validation was performed the available cl data were used to calibrate the model and ensure the model capture the main dynamics of the river system limited data availability should not hinder the use of the models as the process based models still remain as the best available approach of understanding the catchment process to the possible future conditions this is the first study to assess the sources of the awash river salinity and analyze the impact from climate change to the river water quality comprehensive water quality monitoring program in the awash river basin is recommended as it will greatly support modeling applications that provide valuable information for catchment managers and policy makers future monitoring program should not only include flow measurement at the lower awash river basin but also frequent water quality sampling from both the rivers and groundwater across the basin 4 conclusions water quality management is a critical component of water resources water quality deterioration from point and non point sources is of great concern in the awash river basin due to the diverse polluting activities and its economic significance sources of salinity come from both natural processes high saline lake beseka and groundwater and anthropogenic activities effluent discharge and lake beseka discharge this paper uses a multi branched integrated catchment model that incorporates major physical processes to simulate cl concentration in the awash river and lake beseka this is the first study that has tried to integrate the whole awash river system and lake beseka results show that under climate change peak flow would reduce in three future periods up to 25 comparing with the baseline period mixed results of increasing and decreasing flows are projected during low flow months january june and november to december which may reduce clean water availability as for cl without considering the discharge from lake beseka changes in cl concentrations are insignificant and mostly reflect the flow changes however with high discharge rates from lake beseka cl concentration could rise as much as nearly 200 in the near future in the awash river water immediately downstream from the lake during low flow conditions the modeling results clearly showed the impact of the human interference and climate change to the awash river the water quality in the awash river will continue to be affected by both natural process and anthropogenic activities while modeling study provides insights into future conditions that is valuable for planners and local stakeholders to support strategic decision making continued water quality monitoring in both the awash river and lake beseka with integrated basin wide water management practice is essential for future water resources management author statement conceptualization li jin paul whitehead katrina charles methodology li jin paul whitehead
