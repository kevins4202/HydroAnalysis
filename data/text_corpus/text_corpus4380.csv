21900,the widely used spectral representation method for simulation of stationary non gaussian stochastic wave needs the iterative procedure to handle the incompatibility between the power spectral density psd and cumulative density function cdf of the stochastic process and the accuracy and efficiency of the method should be improved in this paper a modified straightforward spectral representation method is developed for accurately and efficiently simulating the non gaussian stochastic wave based on the specified psd and target kurtosis and skewness in the proposed method the stationary non gaussian stochastic wave is first generated based on the specified psd and then transformed into the non gaussian stochastic wave with a modified analytical translation model the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave is further decomposed into random phase angles and amplitudes and the target non gaussian stochastic wave is finally reconstructed with the random phase angles extracted from the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave and the amplitudes discretized from the specified psd the key feature of the proposed method is that the cdf of the non gaussian stochastic wave can be explicitly constructed by the modified translation model and the psd distortion caused by nonlinear transformation can be eliminated with the stochastic wave decomposition and reconstruction procedure the proposed method therefore possesses advantages of immune to incompatibility between the psd and cdf and the non gaussian stochastic wave can be simulated in a straightforward manner without any need for iterations the effectiveness of the proposed method in representing the non gaussian stochastic wave is investigated with a series of case studies numerical results indicate that the proposed method is robust efficient and accurate within engineering expectations it may have a wide range of applicability to engineering problems involving stochastic wave where the gaussian assumption is not appropriate keywords non gaussian stochastic wave gaussian distribution spectral representation method translation process theory stochastic wave reconstruction 1 introduction the stochastic wave acting on offshore structure can cause the dynamic response and cumulative fatigue damage of the structure and result in fatigue failure of structural components and systems ding and chen 2015 in the procedure of dynamic analysis and fatigue assessment the stochastic wave is usually modeled as a stationary gaussian process however the field measurement data indicate that the stochastic wave in shallow water or complex terrain often exhibits non gaussian characteristics with the tail of the probability density function pdf deviated from the gaussian distribution wang 2014 for the softening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis larger than 3 0 the occurrence probability of the wave elevation over 3 0 σ is much larger than that in the gaussian stochastic wave and this may cause extreme dynamic response and accelerate fatigue damage of the offshore structure ding and chen 2014 gong and chen 2014 therefore the non gaussian stochastic wave is of vital important for the safety and reliability of the offshore structure the methodologies available for simulation of the non gaussian stochastic process broadly fall into two categories namely the karhunen loève k l expansion method and the spectral representation method stefanou and papadrakakis 2007 kim and shields 2015 dai et al 2019 the k l expansion method which is a discretization in time or spatial domain is a useful tool to simulate the stationary non gaussian stochastic processes with the prescribed covariance function and marginal probability distribution mpd sakamoto and ghanem 2002 li et al 2007 to accurately simulate the strongly non gaussian stochastic process phoon et al 2002 developed a unified simulation algorithm based on k l expansion in which the k l expansion was adopted to generate the non gaussian stochastic process and an iterative mapping scheme was provided to match the prescribed mpd the algorithm was further extended to simulate the multi dimensional non gaussian stochastic process zheng and dai 2017 recently an explicit non gaussian simulation method had been proposed by dai et al 2019 in the explicit method the k l expansion with an explicit form was given to represent the target stochastic process and the coefficients of the k l expansion were decomposed using unidimensional polynomial chaos expansions it has been confirmed that the k l expansion method is an attractive method to simulate the non gaussian stochastic process but it requires very high computational cost not only because the method often encounters challenge of dealing with hundreds of random variables liu et al 2017 but also for the method needs to iterate the mpd to match the target one dai et al 2019 the spectral representation method which is a discretization in frequency domain is widely used to simulate the stationary gaussian and non gaussian stochastic processes due to its rigorous mathematic formulation and easily implemented algorithm yamazaki and shinozuka 1988 liu et al 2016 in the spectral representation method the gaussian stochastic process is first generated based on the specified psd and then transformed into the non gaussian stochastic process with the aid of nonlinear translation model the moment based hermite model first developed by winterstein 1988 is a widely used nonlinear translation model puig et al 2002 yang and gurley 2015 and the coefficients of the translation model can be given in a closed form expression with the first four statistical moments of the stochastic process or determined by fitting the numerical transformation function derived from the mapping of cdfs of the gaussian and underlying non gaussian stochastic processes directly luo et al 2012 ding and chen 2014 researches indicate that the moment based hermite model is an effective model for simulation of the mildly non gaussian stochastic process especially for the mildly softening non gaussian stochastic process puig et al 2002 ding and chen 2014 yang and gurley 2015 however the moment based hermite model presented by winterstein 1988 is not applicable for simulation of the strongly softening non gaussian stochastic process and the hardening non gaussian stochastic process with kurtosis less than 3 0 in addition the coefficients of the translation model for hardening non gaussian stochastic process cannot be given in a closed form expression based on the statistical moments of the stochastic process ding and chen 2014 gong and chen 2014 to simulate the hardening non gaussian stochastic process accurately the first order approximation for the coefficients of the translation model was developed by winterstein and kashef 2000 but it was only suitable for very mildly hardening non gaussian process recently ding and chen 2015 proposed a closed form formulation for the coefficients of the translation model directly from the kurtosis and skewness of the stochastic process based on the general orthogonal expansion method it should be mentioned that the cdf of the non gaussian stochastic process can be constructed by the nonlinear translation model with the mapping operation while the psd of the non gaussian stochastic process may be distorted due to the nonlinear transformation ding and chen 2015 therefore the spectral representation method for simulation of the non gaussian process may possess incompatibility issue between the cdf and psd of the process shields et al 2011 to handle the incompatibility issue one needs to make the psd of the non gaussian stochastic process to fit the specified one yamazaki and shinozuka 1988 presented a psd iterative algorithm to make the psd of non gaussian stochastic process to satisfy the specified one and the iterative algorithm was further modified to simulate the highly skewed non gaussian stochastic process deodatis and micaletti 2001 recently shields et al 2011 proposed an efficient methodology to simulate the non gaussian stochastic process based on translation process theory where the psd was iteratively upgraded with the psd of computed stochastic process directly rather than through expensive ensemble averaging of psd obtained from the generated non gaussian sample function it has been found that the spectral representation method requires iterative generation of samples to make the cdf and psd of the non gaussian stochastic process compatible and the computational consumption on iteration increases dramatically as the number of variable increases there is still a great need to develop a simple and efficient methodology for simulation of the non gaussian stochastic wave the primary objective of this article is to develop a modified spectral representation method for accurately and efficiently simulating of the stationary non gaussian stochastic wave in the proposed method the stationary gaussian stochastic wave is first generated under the assumption that the psd of the gaussian stochastic wave is identical to the specified psd and then transformed into the non gaussian stochastic wave through a modified translation model parameterized with target kurtosis and skewness the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave is further decomposed into random phase angles and amplitudes and the target non gaussian stochastic wave is finally reconstructed with the random phase angles extracted from the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave and the amplitudes discretized from the specified psd for the modified translation model is a monotonic function and the nonlinear transformation procedure is the probability preserving operation the cdf of the target non gaussian stochastic wave satisfies the target one accurately since the target non gaussian stochastic wave is reconstructed with the amplitudes discretized from the specified psd the psd of the target non gaussian stochastic wave is identical to the specified psd explicitly therefore the proposed method is capable of reliably converging to the target cdf and specified psd without any need for iterations and it is referred as the modified straightforward spectral representation method in this paper to this end this paper is organized as follows in sections 2 and 3 the details of the conventional and proposed methods for simulation of stationary non gaussian stochastic wave are presented respectively in section 4 the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated with a series of case studies finally the conclusions drawn from this work are summarized in section 5 2 conventional spectral representation method for stationary non gaussian stochastic wave the spectral representation method with the translation process theory is widely used to generate the stationary non gaussian stochastic wave due to its rigorous mathematic formulation according to the basic idea of the conventional spectral representation method the psd s n g t ω kurtosis k t and skewness s t of the target non gaussian stochastic wave are given firstly the gaussian stochastic wave is generated under the assumption that the psd of the gaussian stochastic wave is identical to the specified psd and then transformed into the non gaussian stochastic wave with the aid of nonlinear translation model parameterized with the target kurtosis k t and skewness s t due to the nonlinear transformation the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave may deviate from the specified one therefore the psd of the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave should be evaluated and compared with the specified psd if the evaluated psd deviate from the specified psd significantly the iterative algorithm is needed to update the psd to fit the specified one the details of the conventional spectral representation method are illustrated as follows 2 1 simulation of the stationary gaussian stochastic wave the stationary gaussian stochastic wave η g t can be obtained with the fast fourier transform fft algorithm or the harmonic superposition method for a given psd borgman 1969 as illustrated in fig 1 by discretizing the psd s g i ω into n number of components s g i ω δ ω the amplitude of the wave components can be approximated by following expression jia 2008 song and wang 2019 1 a n 2 s g i ω δ ω n 1 2 n where s g i ω is the psd of the gaussian stochastic wave at the i th iteration and s g 1 ω s n g t ω for the first iteration the gaussian stochastic wave η g t is readily obtained with the aid of fft algorithm based on the following formula 2 η g t r e n 1 n a n e i ω n t ϕ n where r e represents the real part and ϕ n are the independent random phase angles uniformly distributed in 0 2 π since the random phase angles ϕ n are mutual independent the stochastic wave generated from eq 2 is asymptotically a gaussian process as the discretized number n approaches to infinite by the central limit theorem the deviation level of the non gaussian stochastic process from the gaussian law can be revealed by the statistical parameters of the process namely kurtosis k and skewness s and they can be given as 3 k η μ 4 σ 4 e η μ 4 e η μ 2 2 4 s η μ 3 σ 3 e η μ 3 e η μ 2 3 2 where μ 3 and μ 4 are the third and fourth central moments of the stochastic process η μ is the mean value and σ is the standard deviation of the stochastic process η for a gaussian process the kurtosis and skewness are identical to 3 0 and 0 0 respectively the process whose kurtosis is not equal to 3 0 or skewness is not identical to 0 0 is referred as a non gaussian process furthermore the non gaussian process with kurtosis larger than 3 0 is referred as softening non gaussian process while the non gaussian process with kurtosis less than 3 0 is referred as hardening non gaussian process 2 2 translation process theory for the non gaussian stochastic wave the non gaussian stochastic wave can relate to the gaussian stochastic wave with the translation process theory and yields grigoriu 1995 5 z g x f z 1 φ x where z η n g μ n g σ n g and x η g μ g σ g are the standard non gaussian and gaussian stochastic wave respectively μ n g and μ g are the mean value of the non gaussian and gaussian stochastic wave and both of them approach to zero for the stationary process σ n g and σ g are the standard deviation of the non gaussian and gaussian stochastic wave and they are assumed to identical to the square root of zeroth moment of the specified psd g is the memoryless monotonic translation function f z and φ are the cdfs of non gaussian and gaussian stochastic wave and f z 1 is the inverse function of f z according to the principle of translation process theory the cdf of the non gaussian stochastic wave is identical to that of the gaussian stochastic wave exactly and the translation process is therefore referred as the probability preserving transformation 2 3 translation model for the softening non gaussian stochastic wave in general the standard non gaussian stochastic wave can be represented by a hermite polynomial expansion of the standard gaussian stochastic wave winterstein 1988 6 z κ x h 3 x 2 1 h 4 x 3 3 x where κ h 3 and h 4 are the coefficients of the translation model and they can be formed with the first four statistical moments of the non gaussian stochastic wave in the translation model the parameter κ is utilized to preserve the unit standard deviation and parameters h 3 and h 4 are used to fit the target cdf for the coefficients are related to the statistical moments of stochastic wave this translation model is also referred as moment based hermite model a closed form expression of the translation model coefficient which was obtained based on an optimal procedure to minimize the difference of target kurtosis and skewness with these from translation model can be given as 7 κ 1 1 2 h 3 2 6 h 4 2 h 3 s 6 1 0 015 s 0 3 s 2 1 0 2 k 3 h 4 h 40 1 1 43 s 2 k 3 1 0 1 k 0 8 h 40 1 1 25 k 3 1 3 1 10 where k and s are the kurtosis and skewness of the target non gaussian stochastic wave it has been proven that the above translation model is effective for mildly softening non gaussian stochastic wave but it is less effective for strongly softening non gaussian stochastic wave ding and chen 2014 in addition this translation model cannot be applicable for simulation of the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave and the skewed non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 3 0 ding and chen 2014 2 4 translation model for the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave a translation model for simulation of the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave was developed by ding and chen 2015 based on the orthogonal expansion of the stochastic wave and yields 8 z ξ 2 x c ξ x 1 3 ξ 2 x c ξ x 1 3 a 9 ξ x x 2 b 4 s 2 a 1 5 1 5 b a 2 a b 3 3 b 4 b b 2 b 3 s b 4 k 3 b 4 c b a 2 3 10 ϕ 1 0 06 3 k 1 3 b 2 ϕ 1 s 4 1 2 s 2 0 18 7 5 e 0 5 k b 3 0 8 s 5 s 3 0 77 s k 1 2 0 5 b 4 ϕ 0 04 11 5 s 4 6 8 s 2 3 5 s 2 0 4 2 0 15 the translation model provides a very convenient way for simulation of the softening and hardening non gaussian stochastic wave and the cdf of the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave agrees well with the target one with the probability preserving operation but the psd of the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave may deviate from the prescribed psd due to the nonlinear transformation therefore the cdf and psd of the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave cannot converge to the target cdf and psd simultaneously and the conventional spectral representation method possesses the incompatibility issue of the cdf and psd and the iterative procedure is needed to update the psd of the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave to fit the prescribed one 2 5 iterative procedure for updating the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave to make the psd of the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave to satisfy the prescribed one several methodologies have been developed such as the ones developed by yamazaki and shinozuka 1988 deodatis and micaletti 2001 bocchini and deodatis 2008 etc according to the iterative procedure proposed by yamazaki and shinozuka 1988 the psd s ˆ n g i of the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave is evaluated and compared with the prescribed psd s n g t ω if the evaluated psd s ˆ n g i deviate from the prescribed psd s n g t ω significantly the psd s g i 1 ω of the gaussian stochastic wave at the i 1 th iteration will be updated with the psd s g i ω of the gaussian stochastic wave at i th iteration and the evaluated psd s ˆ n g i of the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave at i th iteration and the prescribed psd s n g t ω of the non gaussian stochastic wave the psd for generating the gaussian stochastic wave at the i 1 th iteration can be given as 11 s g i 1 ω s g i ω s ˆ n g i ω s n g t ω i 1 2 3 n following the procedure illustrated in section 2 1 the gaussian stochastic wave at the i th iteration can be generated from the updated psd s g i ω and the same random phase angles then the gaussian stochastic wave is further mapped into the non gaussian stochastic wave with the translation model updating the psd of the gaussian stochastic wave in terms of eq 11 is performed for the following reasons the psd for each wave frequency changes due to the nonlinear transformation operation but the rate of the change at each wave frequency which is represented by the ratio s g i ω s ˆ n g i ω is expected to approach to a constant value as the iteration number i increases therefore deviation of the evaluated psd s ˆ n g i ω and the prescribed psd s n g t ω will disappear as the iteration number i increases the flow chart of the conventional spectral representation method for simulation of the stationary non gaussian stochastic wave is illustrated in fig 2 3 the modified straightforward method for simulation of the non gaussian stochastic wave referring to the principle of the conventional spectral representation method one can find that the conventional method is less effective for strongly softening and skewed non gaussian stochastic wave furthermore the conventional method possesses the incompatibility issue of the cdf and psd and the iterative procedure is needed to eliminate the psd distortion caused by the nonlinear transformation therefore the accuracy and efficiency of the conventional method need to be improved in this paper a modified spectral representation method which can simulate the strongly non gaussian stochastic wave in a straightforward manner without any need for iterations is developed for accurate and efficient simulation of the stationary non gaussian stochastic wave the proposed method involves five steps in the first step the parameters of the target non gaussian stochastic wave including the psd kurtosis k t and skewness s t related to the cdf are given in advance in the second step the gaussian stochastic wave is generated based on the given psd and a modified analytical translation model parameterized with the kurtosis k t and skewness s t is established in the third step the gaussian stochastic wave is mapped into the non gaussian stochastic wave with the aid of the established translation model in the fourth step the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave is decomposed into the random phase angles and amplitudes in the last step the target non gaussian stochastic wave is reconstructed with the random phase angles extracted from the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave and the amplitudes discretized from the specified psd in the proposed method the steps 2 and 3 are adopted to accurately construct the cdf of the target non gaussian stochastic wave and the steps 4 and 5 are utilized to make the psd of the target non gaussian stochastic wave to satisfy the specified one 3 1 the modified translation model for the softening non gaussian stochastic wave to make the cdf of the softening non gaussian stochastic wave to satisfy the target one accurately a modified analytical translation model parameterized with the kurtosis k t and skewness s t of the target non gaussian stochastic wave is provided in this paper and yields 12 z κ x h 3 x 2 1 h 4 x 3 3 x 13 κ 1 1 2 h 3 2 6 h 4 2 h 3 3 s t 4 2 1 1 5 k t 3 h 4 1 1 5 k t 3 1 8 65 0 01 h s t z where z η n g t t μ n g t σ n g t and x η g t μ g σ g are the standard non gaussian and gaussian stochastic wave respectively μ n g t and σ n g t are the mean value and standard deviation of the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave η n g t t μ g and σ g are the mean value and standard deviation of the gaussian stochastic wave respectively comparing with the conventional translation model proposed by winterstein 1988 one can find that the hermite polynomial expansion in the modified translation model adopted to relate the standard non gaussian and gaussian stochastic wave is same with that in the conventional method however the coefficients of the modified translation model are obviously different from the coefficients of the conventional translation model first of all the coefficients of the modified translation model which are obtained with the aid of the least square curve fitting method are so concisely and more rigorously compared with that of the conventional translation model next the effects of the input wave parameters including the significant wave height h s and the zero up crossing period t z are incorporated into the coefficients of the modified translation model to accurately simulate the strongly softening non gaussian stochastic wave finally the coefficients of the modified translation model always have physical meaning even for the extreme case with kurtosis of 3 0 and it means that the modified translation model outperforms the conventional translation model on applicability for example the modified translation model can be applicable to simulate the strongly skewed non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 3 0 while the conventional translation model cannot be applicable for simulation of the skewed non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 3 0 3 2 the modified translation model for the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave for the probability characteristics of the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave are different from that of the softening non gaussian stochastic wave the translation model for the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave is distinguished from that for the softening non gaussian stochastic wave a modified translation model for the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave is provided in this paper and it can be given as 14 z ξ 2 x c ξ x 1 3 ξ 2 x c ξ x 1 3 a 15 ξ x x 1 7 k t 3 3 b 4 s t 2 a 1 5 1 5 b a 2 a b 3 3 b 4 b b 2 b 3 s t b 4 k t 3 b 4 c b a 2 3 16 ϕ 1 0 06 3 k t 1 3 b 2 ϕ 1 s t 4 1 2 s t 2 0 18 7 5 e 0 5 k t b 3 0 8 s t 5 s t 3 0 77 s t k t 1 2 0 5 b 4 ϕ 0 04 11 5 s t 4 6 8 s t 2 3 5 k t 2 0 4 2 0 15 the closed form expressions of the coefficients associated with the modified translation model for the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave are obtained by means of the least square curve fitting method and they have similar expressions with the coefficients of the conventional translation model after a careful comparison between the coefficients of the modified and conventional translation model one can find that the kurtosis of the target non gaussian stochastic wave is incorporated into the expression of ξ x in the modified translation model for accurately simulation of the strongly hardening non gaussian stochastic wave 3 3 reconstruction of the target non gaussian stochastic wave the cdf of the non gaussian stochastic wave is not only related to the psd but also related to the random phase angles for a gaussian stochastic wave the random phase angles are mutual independent and uniformly distributed in 0 2 π however for a non gaussian stochastic wave the random phase angles are not mutual independent and not follow uniform distribution in 0 2 π it should be mentioned that the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave is independent from the random phase angles and it has slight influence on the probability characteristics of the non gaussian stochastic wave grigoriu 2009 therefore to eliminate the psd distortion caused by the nonlinear transformation the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave can be decomposed into the random phase angles and amplitudes and the target non gaussian stochastic wave can be reconstructed with the random phase angles extracted from the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave and the amplitudes discretized from the prescribed psd with the aid of fft algorithm the extracted random phase angles ϕ n g t of the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave and the reconstructed target non gaussian stochastic wave η n g t can be given as 17 ϕ n g t a n g l e fft η n g t t 18 η n g t r e n 1 n a n e i ω n t ϕ n g t where ϕ n g t are the random phase angles extracted from the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave and a n are the amplitudes discretized from the specified psd see eq 1 η n g t is the reconstructed target non gaussian stochastic wave with the psd identical to the prescribed one the flow chart of the proposed method is illustrated in fig 3 in the proposed method the cdf of the non gaussian stochastic wave agrees well with the target cdf for the modified translation model is a monotonic function and the transformation procedure is the probability preserving operation the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave is identical to the prescribed one since it is reconstructed with the amplitudes discretized from the specified psd the proposed method has advantages of immune the incompatibility issue of the cdf and psd and it can be used to simulate the non gaussian stochastic wave based on the prescribed psd and target kurtosis and skewness without any need for iterations therefore the proposed method is referred as the modified straightforward spectral representation method in this paper in contrast to the conventional method the proposed method is simple and efficient and can be used to simulate the hardening softening and skewed non gaussian stochastic wave accurately it provides a useful tool to investigate the influence of non gaussian stochastic wave on the extreme dynamic response and fatigue damage of offshore structures 4 numerical studies and discussions to fully investigate the effectiveness of the proposed straightforward spectral representation method the non gaussian stochastic wave with different psds and target kurtosis and skewness are simulated and the accuracy efficiency and convergence of the proposed method are validated with the conventional method 4 1 environmental conditions for clearly illustrating the validation of the proposed method three different sea states namely benign moderate and harsh sea states are adopted in this study to simulate the non gaussian stochastic wave with different kurtosis and skewness two widely used spectra namely jonswap narrowband spectrum and torsethaugen two peaked broadband spectrum are adopted to characterize the psd of the input sea states dnvgl 2014 the wave parameters of the selected sea states are summarized in table 1 4 2 elevation of the non gaussian stochastic wave the elevation of the non gaussian stochastic wave is distinguished from that of the gaussian stochastic wave and the difference of the wave elevation may have significant influence on the cdf and psd of the stochastic wave in this section the gaussian and non gaussian stochastic wave with different kurtosis and psds are simulated with the proposed and conventional methods two typical cases a hardening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 2 0 and a softening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 5 0 under the moderate sea state are selected for demonstration both the long period and short period wave elevation are provided to clearly illustrate the discrepancies of gaussian and non gaussian stochastic wave as illustrated in figs 4 and 5 respectively the long period stochastic wave elevation is composed of 131072 sample points at 0 1s interval while the short period stochastic wave elevation is a segment of the long period wave elevation which is composed of 1000 sample points at 0 1 s interval from fig 4 one can find that the wave elevation of the gaussian and non gaussian stochastic wave generated from the conventional method shows similar variation trends because the translation model in the conventional method can preserve the random phase angles of stochastic wave however the wave elevation of the non gaussian stochastic wave is distinguished from that of the gaussian stochastic wave at wave crests and troughs for the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 2 0 the wave elevation of the non gaussian stochastic wave is much smaller than that of the gaussian stochastic wave at the wave crests near simulation time of 1125 s 5545 s and 11988 s nevertheless for the softening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 5 0 the wave elevation of the non gaussian stochastic wave is much larger than that of the gaussian stochastic wave at the wave crests near simulation time of 1125 s 5545 s and 11988 s therefore one can deduce that the occurrence probability of the wave elevation larger than 3 σ in the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave is much smaller than that in the gaussian stochastic wave while the occurrence probability of the wave elevation larger than 3 σ in the softening non gaussian stochastic wave is much larger than that in the gaussian stochastic wave different from the wave elevation associated with the conventional simulation method the elevations of the hardening and softening non gaussian stochastic wave generated from the proposed method show different variation trends with the gaussian stochastic wave as illustrated in fig 5 the reason is that the non gaussian stochastic wave related to the proposed method is reconstructed with the random phase angles extracted from the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave and the amplitudes discretized from the prescribed psd and there may exist phase difference between the reconstructed non gaussian stochastic wave and the gaussian stochastic wave therefore the crests troughs of the gaussian and non gaussian stochastic wave do not occur simultaneously and the elevation of the gaussian and non gaussian stochastic wave cannot be compared at the crests troughs directly in this study the non gaussian stochastic wave elevation at the crests troughs are compared with the gaussian stochastic wave at the next adjacent crests troughs by taking the phase lag into consideration as can been seen from fig 5 the phenomenon that softening non gaussian stochastic wave elevation over the gaussian and hardening non gaussian stochastic wave elevation at the crests occurs many times however this phenomenon does not occur at every crest for the energy distribution of the gaussian and non gaussian stochastic wave are identical therefore from a statistical point of view one can conclude that the elevation of hardening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 2 0 is generally smaller than that of the gaussian stochastic wave at the specific crests and troughs and the elevation of the softening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 5 0 is generally larger than that of the gaussian stochastic wave at the specific crests and troughs 4 3 the accuracy of the proposed method to investigate the accuracy of the proposed method the kurtosis and skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave generated from the proposed method are evaluated and compared with the target kurtosis and skewness for clearly illustrating the accuracy of the proposed method two different scenarios are analyzed the first scenario is that the target skewness is set to 0 0 and the target kurtosis ranges from 2 0 to 10 0 at 0 2 interval and the accuracy of the proposed method for simulation of the hardening and softening non gaussian stochastic wave is investigated the second scenario is that the target kurtosis is set to 3 5 and the target skewness varies from 0 5 to 0 5 at 0 1 interval and the accuracy of the proposed method for simulation of the skewed non gaussian stochastic is analyzed to have a good understanding of the accuracy of the proposed method the kurtosis and skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave simulated with the conventional method under these two scenarios are also investigated it should be mentioned that the conventional method cannot be applicable to simulate the skewed non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 3 0 and hence the target kurtosis is set to 3 5 in the second scenario in the first scenario the kurtosis and the skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave generated from the proposed and conventional methods under the moderate sea state are presented in fig 6 in the figure the dash lines are the reference lines where the kurtosis skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave is identical to the target kurtosis skewness and it is regarded as a benchmark to reveal the accuracy of the simulation methods the results with square marker are the kurtosis skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave associated with the conventional method while the results with circle marker are the kurtosis skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave related to the proposed method for the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave case the kurtosis and skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave generated from the proposed and conventional methods are almost identical to the target kurtosis and skewness for all the cited kurtosis this indicates that both the proposed and the conventional methods can simulate the strongly hardening non gaussian stochastic wave accurately however it should be mentioned that the performance of the proposed method outperforms the conventional method on efficiency since the target non gaussian stochastic wave can be simulated with the proposed method in a straightforward manner without any need for iterations for the softening non gaussian stochastic wave case the kurtosis of the non gaussian stochastic wave generated from the conventional method deviates from the target kurtosis significantly the evaluated kurtosis is smaller than the target kurtosis when the target kurtosis is smaller than 7 0 while the evaluated kurtosis becomes larger than the target kurtosis when the target kurtosis is larger than 7 0 it is worth noting that the deviation level of the evaluated and target kurtosis increases dramatically as the target kurtosis increases from 7 0 to infinite however different from the results associated with the conventional method the kurtosis of the non gaussian stochastic wave generated from the proposed method is in perfect agreement with the target kurtosis for all the cited kurtosis this means that the proposed method can simulate the mildly and strongly softening non gaussian stochastic wave accurately while the conventional method cannot simulate the strongly softening non gaussian stochastic wave accurately in addition the skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave generated from the conventional and proposed methods are close to but slightly smaller than the target skewness and the deviation level between the evaluated and target skewness increases slightly as the target kurtosis increases this means that the skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave is related to the kurtosis of the non gaussian stochastic wave and the strongly softening non gaussian stochastic wave with skewness of 0 0 cannot be simulated effectively in the second scenario the target kurtosis is set to 3 5 and the skewness varies from 0 5 to 0 5 at 0 1 interval the kurtosis and skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave simulated with the proposed and conventional methods under the moderate sea state are illustrated in fig 7 from the figure one can find that the skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave generated from the proposed and conventional methods are very close to but not identical to the target skewness however after a careful comparison between the evaluated skewness related to the proposed and conventional methods one can find the differences on one hand the evaluated skewness of the conventional method deviates from the target skewness as the target skewness increases or decreases from zero to infinite on the other hand the evaluated skewness of the proposed method is consistently close to the target skewness for all the cited skewness the accuracy of the proposed method for simulation of the highly skewed non gaussian stochastic wave is better than the conventional method in addition one can also find that the kurtosis of the non gaussian stochastic wave is closely related to the skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave for the conventional method case the kurtosis of the non gaussian stochastic wave increases as the target skewness increases or decreases from zero to infinite and it is always much smaller than the target kurtosis it should be mentioned that the target kurtosis is set to 3 5 in this scenario and the largest discrepancy between the evaluated and target kurtosis is about 1 3 for the proposed method case the kurtosis of the non gaussian stochastic wave is always larger than the target kurtosis the largest discrepancy of the evaluated and target kurtosis associated with the proposed method is about 0 7 which is much smaller than that of the conventional method in general the performance of the proposed method outperforms the conventional method on accuracy and the hardening softening and skewed non gaussian stochastic wave can be simulated with the proposed method accurately referring to the results associated with the jonswap and torsethaugen spectra one can find that the evaluated kurtosis skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave under the torsethaugen spectrum is very close to but slightly larger than that under the jonswap spectrum for a specific target kurtosis skewness this indicates that the proposed method works as well for both narrowband and broadband spectra 4 4 the convergence and efficiency of the proposed method the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave may deviate from the target one due to the nonlinear transformation which may have significant influence on the fatigue damage of the structure and more attention should be paid to the convergence characteristics of the psd to investigate the convergence of the proposed method the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave simulated with the conventional and proposed methods are evaluated and compared with the specified psd two representative cases the softening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 5 0 and 7 0 under moderate sea state are selected for demonstration the comparison results of the evaluated and target psds associated with the conventional and proposed methods are presented in figs 8 and 9 respectively for clearly illustrating the discrepancies of the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave and the specified psd the ordinates of the figures are presented in the logarithmic form from fig 8 a and b one can find that the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave is not identical to the specified psd for the conventional method it is notable that the deviation level of the evaluated and specified psd increases as the kurtosis of the non gaussian stochastic wave increases one can also find that the evaluated psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave will approach to the specified psd gradually with the aid of the iterative procedure but it will not be exactly identical to the specified one especially for the low frequency and high frequency components for the mildly softening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 5 0 the evaluated psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave converges to the specified psd with 2 iterations while the evaluated psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave converges to the specified psd after 46 iterations for the strongly softening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 7 0 similar characteristics and variation trend can be observed in fig 9 a and b this indicates that the efficiency of the conventional method decreases as the non gaussianity of the stochastic wave becomes strong as can be seen from figs 8 c and fig 9 c the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave generated from the proposed method is exactly identical to the specified psd for the mildly and strongly softening non gaussian stochastic wave whether the input psd is a narrowband or a broadband spectrum this means that the proposed method is capable of reliably converging to the specified psd and it has robustness to the mildly and strongly non gaussian stochastic wave for the cdf of the non gaussian stochastic wave matches well with the target one and the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave satisfies the prescribed one and the cdf of the non gaussian stochastic wave therefore is compatible well with the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave without any need for iterations in this proposed method these features make the proposed method to be useful tool for the engineering problems involving the stochastic wave where the gaussian assumption is not appropriate 4 5 the probability distribution of the non gaussian stochastic wave to further investigate the applicability of the proposed method the hardening softening and skewed non gaussian stochastic wave under the benign moderate and harsh sea states are simulated with the proposed method and the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave is evaluated and compared with the gaussian distribution 4 5 1 hardening non gaussian stochastic wave the histogram of the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 2 5 is presented in fig 10 in the figure the bars represent the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave elevation and the line is the gaussian distribution parameterized with mean value μ and standard deviation σ of the stochastic wave there are two features worthy of attention in the figure on one hand the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave is symmetrical about its mean value but it deviates from the gaussian distribution significantly taking the non gaussian stochastic wave under the moderate sea state for example the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave is much smaller than the gaussian distribution when the wave elevation is smaller than 0 65 σ or larger than 2 0 σ σ is the standard deviation of the stochastic wave nevertheless the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave is much larger than the gaussian distribution when the wave elevation is between 0 65 σ and 2 0 σ on the other hand the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave shows similar characteristics for the benign moderate and harsh sea states however the turn points where the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave becomes larger than the gaussian distribution are slightly difference for the benign moderate and harsh sea states according to the comparison results one can find that the occurrence probability of the wave elevation larger than 2 0 σ in hardening non gaussian stochastic wave is much smaller than that in gaussian stochastic wave therefore the extreme response as well as the fatigue damage of the structure may be overestimated if a hardening non gaussian stochastic wave is simplified as a gaussian stochastic wave 4 5 2 softening non gaussian stochastic wave for softening non gaussian stochastic waves with kurtosis of 5 0 and 7 0 the histograms of the wave elevations are illustrated in figs 11 and 12 respectively from the figures one can see that the histograms of the softening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 5 0 and 7 0 show similar characteristics for the benign moderate and harsh sea states and both of them are symmetrical about its mean value however the histogram of the softening non gaussian stochastic wave is distinguished from the histogram of the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave obviously taking the softening non gaussian stochastic wave under moderate sea state as an example the histogram of the softening non gaussian stochastic wave is much larger than the gaussian distribution when the wave elevation is smaller than 0 68 σ or larger than 2 5 σ while the histogram of the wave elevation becomes slightly smaller than the gaussian distribution for the wave elevation between 0 68 σ and 2 5 σ furthermore the discrepancies between the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave and the gaussian distribution increase as the kurtosis increases from 5 0 to 7 0 in addition the turn points where the histogram of the softening non gaussian stochastic wave becomes larger than the gaussian distribution are slightly difference for the benign moderate and harsh sea states it should be mentioned that the occurrence probability of the wave elevation over 2 5 σ in softening non gaussian stochastic wave is much larger than that in gaussian stochastic wave and it may cause the extreme dynamic response and accelerate the fatigue damage of structure significantly therefore the extreme dynamic response and the fatigue damage of the structure may be underestimated if a softening non gaussian stochastic wave is simplified as a gaussian stochastic wave 4 5 3 skewed non gaussian stochastic wave for the skewed non gaussian stochastic wave with the skewness of 0 5 the histogram of the wave elevation is presented in fig 13 it can be seen from the figure that the histogram of the skewed non gaussian stochastic wave also deviates from the gaussian distribution significantly however different from the histogram of the hardening and softening non gaussian stochastic wave the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave with the skewness of 0 5 is asymmetrical about its mean value for wave troughs case the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave is much larger than the gaussian distribution when the wave elevation is smaller than 1 53 σ and the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave becomes smaller than the gaussian distribution as the wave elevation increases however for wave crests case the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave is much smaller than the gaussian distribution when the wave elevation is smaller than 1 72 σ and the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave becomes larger than the gaussian distribution as the wave elevation increases in addition the turn points where the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave becomes larger or smaller than the gaussian distribution are slightly difference for the benign moderate and harsh sea states and the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave with skewness of 0 5 usually has a long tail in the wave crest side the deviation of the skewed non gaussian and gaussian stochastic wave may have influence on the extreme dynamic response and fatigue damage of the structure referring to the comparison results one can find that the histograms of the non gaussian stochastic waves show similar characteristics for the benign moderate and harsh sea states but all of them deviate from the gaussian distribution significantly for the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave the probability of the wave elevation larger than 2 0 σ is much smaller than that of the gaussian distribution while for the softening non gaussian stochastic wave the probability of the wave elevation larger than 2 5 σ is much larger than that of the gaussian distribution therefore the dynamic response and the fatigue damage of the structure to the non gaussian stochastic wave are distinguished from these to the gaussian stochastic wave definitely and more attention should be paid to the engineering problems involving stochastic wave where the gaussian assumption is not appropriate 5 conclusions in this paper a modified straightforward spectral representation method is developed for accurate and efficient simulation of the non gaussian stochastic wave in the proposed method a modified analytical translation model is provided to accurately construct the cdf of the target non gaussian stochastic wave and an improved stochastic wave decomposition and reconstruction procedure is adopted to eliminate the psd distortion caused by the nonlinear transformation the proposed method has advantages of avoiding the incompatibility issue between the cdf and psd and simulating the non gaussian stochastic wave in a straightforward manner without any need for iterations the effectiveness of the proposed method has been numerically validated according to the study of this paper some main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the proposed method is a useful tool for simulation of the hardening softening and skewed non gaussian stochastic wave and the cdf as well as the psd of the target non gaussian stochastic wave are in perfect agreement with the target ones the proposed method is robust efficient and accurate within engineering expectations 2 the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave deviates from the gaussian distribution significantly and the deviation level increases as the kurtosis and skewness of non gaussian stochastic wave increase more attention should be paid to the engineering problems involving stochastic wave where the gaussian assumption is not appropriate credit authorship

21900,the widely used spectral representation method for simulation of stationary non gaussian stochastic wave needs the iterative procedure to handle the incompatibility between the power spectral density psd and cumulative density function cdf of the stochastic process and the accuracy and efficiency of the method should be improved in this paper a modified straightforward spectral representation method is developed for accurately and efficiently simulating the non gaussian stochastic wave based on the specified psd and target kurtosis and skewness in the proposed method the stationary non gaussian stochastic wave is first generated based on the specified psd and then transformed into the non gaussian stochastic wave with a modified analytical translation model the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave is further decomposed into random phase angles and amplitudes and the target non gaussian stochastic wave is finally reconstructed with the random phase angles extracted from the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave and the amplitudes discretized from the specified psd the key feature of the proposed method is that the cdf of the non gaussian stochastic wave can be explicitly constructed by the modified translation model and the psd distortion caused by nonlinear transformation can be eliminated with the stochastic wave decomposition and reconstruction procedure the proposed method therefore possesses advantages of immune to incompatibility between the psd and cdf and the non gaussian stochastic wave can be simulated in a straightforward manner without any need for iterations the effectiveness of the proposed method in representing the non gaussian stochastic wave is investigated with a series of case studies numerical results indicate that the proposed method is robust efficient and accurate within engineering expectations it may have a wide range of applicability to engineering problems involving stochastic wave where the gaussian assumption is not appropriate keywords non gaussian stochastic wave gaussian distribution spectral representation method translation process theory stochastic wave reconstruction 1 introduction the stochastic wave acting on offshore structure can cause the dynamic response and cumulative fatigue damage of the structure and result in fatigue failure of structural components and systems ding and chen 2015 in the procedure of dynamic analysis and fatigue assessment the stochastic wave is usually modeled as a stationary gaussian process however the field measurement data indicate that the stochastic wave in shallow water or complex terrain often exhibits non gaussian characteristics with the tail of the probability density function pdf deviated from the gaussian distribution wang 2014 for the softening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis larger than 3 0 the occurrence probability of the wave elevation over 3 0 σ is much larger than that in the gaussian stochastic wave and this may cause extreme dynamic response and accelerate fatigue damage of the offshore structure ding and chen 2014 gong and chen 2014 therefore the non gaussian stochastic wave is of vital important for the safety and reliability of the offshore structure the methodologies available for simulation of the non gaussian stochastic process broadly fall into two categories namely the karhunen loève k l expansion method and the spectral representation method stefanou and papadrakakis 2007 kim and shields 2015 dai et al 2019 the k l expansion method which is a discretization in time or spatial domain is a useful tool to simulate the stationary non gaussian stochastic processes with the prescribed covariance function and marginal probability distribution mpd sakamoto and ghanem 2002 li et al 2007 to accurately simulate the strongly non gaussian stochastic process phoon et al 2002 developed a unified simulation algorithm based on k l expansion in which the k l expansion was adopted to generate the non gaussian stochastic process and an iterative mapping scheme was provided to match the prescribed mpd the algorithm was further extended to simulate the multi dimensional non gaussian stochastic process zheng and dai 2017 recently an explicit non gaussian simulation method had been proposed by dai et al 2019 in the explicit method the k l expansion with an explicit form was given to represent the target stochastic process and the coefficients of the k l expansion were decomposed using unidimensional polynomial chaos expansions it has been confirmed that the k l expansion method is an attractive method to simulate the non gaussian stochastic process but it requires very high computational cost not only because the method often encounters challenge of dealing with hundreds of random variables liu et al 2017 but also for the method needs to iterate the mpd to match the target one dai et al 2019 the spectral representation method which is a discretization in frequency domain is widely used to simulate the stationary gaussian and non gaussian stochastic processes due to its rigorous mathematic formulation and easily implemented algorithm yamazaki and shinozuka 1988 liu et al 2016 in the spectral representation method the gaussian stochastic process is first generated based on the specified psd and then transformed into the non gaussian stochastic process with the aid of nonlinear translation model the moment based hermite model first developed by winterstein 1988 is a widely used nonlinear translation model puig et al 2002 yang and gurley 2015 and the coefficients of the translation model can be given in a closed form expression with the first four statistical moments of the stochastic process or determined by fitting the numerical transformation function derived from the mapping of cdfs of the gaussian and underlying non gaussian stochastic processes directly luo et al 2012 ding and chen 2014 researches indicate that the moment based hermite model is an effective model for simulation of the mildly non gaussian stochastic process especially for the mildly softening non gaussian stochastic process puig et al 2002 ding and chen 2014 yang and gurley 2015 however the moment based hermite model presented by winterstein 1988 is not applicable for simulation of the strongly softening non gaussian stochastic process and the hardening non gaussian stochastic process with kurtosis less than 3 0 in addition the coefficients of the translation model for hardening non gaussian stochastic process cannot be given in a closed form expression based on the statistical moments of the stochastic process ding and chen 2014 gong and chen 2014 to simulate the hardening non gaussian stochastic process accurately the first order approximation for the coefficients of the translation model was developed by winterstein and kashef 2000 but it was only suitable for very mildly hardening non gaussian process recently ding and chen 2015 proposed a closed form formulation for the coefficients of the translation model directly from the kurtosis and skewness of the stochastic process based on the general orthogonal expansion method it should be mentioned that the cdf of the non gaussian stochastic process can be constructed by the nonlinear translation model with the mapping operation while the psd of the non gaussian stochastic process may be distorted due to the nonlinear transformation ding and chen 2015 therefore the spectral representation method for simulation of the non gaussian process may possess incompatibility issue between the cdf and psd of the process shields et al 2011 to handle the incompatibility issue one needs to make the psd of the non gaussian stochastic process to fit the specified one yamazaki and shinozuka 1988 presented a psd iterative algorithm to make the psd of non gaussian stochastic process to satisfy the specified one and the iterative algorithm was further modified to simulate the highly skewed non gaussian stochastic process deodatis and micaletti 2001 recently shields et al 2011 proposed an efficient methodology to simulate the non gaussian stochastic process based on translation process theory where the psd was iteratively upgraded with the psd of computed stochastic process directly rather than through expensive ensemble averaging of psd obtained from the generated non gaussian sample function it has been found that the spectral representation method requires iterative generation of samples to make the cdf and psd of the non gaussian stochastic process compatible and the computational consumption on iteration increases dramatically as the number of variable increases there is still a great need to develop a simple and efficient methodology for simulation of the non gaussian stochastic wave the primary objective of this article is to develop a modified spectral representation method for accurately and efficiently simulating of the stationary non gaussian stochastic wave in the proposed method the stationary gaussian stochastic wave is first generated under the assumption that the psd of the gaussian stochastic wave is identical to the specified psd and then transformed into the non gaussian stochastic wave through a modified translation model parameterized with target kurtosis and skewness the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave is further decomposed into random phase angles and amplitudes and the target non gaussian stochastic wave is finally reconstructed with the random phase angles extracted from the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave and the amplitudes discretized from the specified psd for the modified translation model is a monotonic function and the nonlinear transformation procedure is the probability preserving operation the cdf of the target non gaussian stochastic wave satisfies the target one accurately since the target non gaussian stochastic wave is reconstructed with the amplitudes discretized from the specified psd the psd of the target non gaussian stochastic wave is identical to the specified psd explicitly therefore the proposed method is capable of reliably converging to the target cdf and specified psd without any need for iterations and it is referred as the modified straightforward spectral representation method in this paper to this end this paper is organized as follows in sections 2 and 3 the details of the conventional and proposed methods for simulation of stationary non gaussian stochastic wave are presented respectively in section 4 the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated with a series of case studies finally the conclusions drawn from this work are summarized in section 5 2 conventional spectral representation method for stationary non gaussian stochastic wave the spectral representation method with the translation process theory is widely used to generate the stationary non gaussian stochastic wave due to its rigorous mathematic formulation according to the basic idea of the conventional spectral representation method the psd s n g t ω kurtosis k t and skewness s t of the target non gaussian stochastic wave are given firstly the gaussian stochastic wave is generated under the assumption that the psd of the gaussian stochastic wave is identical to the specified psd and then transformed into the non gaussian stochastic wave with the aid of nonlinear translation model parameterized with the target kurtosis k t and skewness s t due to the nonlinear transformation the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave may deviate from the specified one therefore the psd of the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave should be evaluated and compared with the specified psd if the evaluated psd deviate from the specified psd significantly the iterative algorithm is needed to update the psd to fit the specified one the details of the conventional spectral representation method are illustrated as follows 2 1 simulation of the stationary gaussian stochastic wave the stationary gaussian stochastic wave η g t can be obtained with the fast fourier transform fft algorithm or the harmonic superposition method for a given psd borgman 1969 as illustrated in fig 1 by discretizing the psd s g i ω into n number of components s g i ω δ ω the amplitude of the wave components can be approximated by following expression jia 2008 song and wang 2019 1 a n 2 s g i ω δ ω n 1 2 n where s g i ω is the psd of the gaussian stochastic wave at the i th iteration and s g 1 ω s n g t ω for the first iteration the gaussian stochastic wave η g t is readily obtained with the aid of fft algorithm based on the following formula 2 η g t r e n 1 n a n e i ω n t ϕ n where r e represents the real part and ϕ n are the independent random phase angles uniformly distributed in 0 2 π since the random phase angles ϕ n are mutual independent the stochastic wave generated from eq 2 is asymptotically a gaussian process as the discretized number n approaches to infinite by the central limit theorem the deviation level of the non gaussian stochastic process from the gaussian law can be revealed by the statistical parameters of the process namely kurtosis k and skewness s and they can be given as 3 k η μ 4 σ 4 e η μ 4 e η μ 2 2 4 s η μ 3 σ 3 e η μ 3 e η μ 2 3 2 where μ 3 and μ 4 are the third and fourth central moments of the stochastic process η μ is the mean value and σ is the standard deviation of the stochastic process η for a gaussian process the kurtosis and skewness are identical to 3 0 and 0 0 respectively the process whose kurtosis is not equal to 3 0 or skewness is not identical to 0 0 is referred as a non gaussian process furthermore the non gaussian process with kurtosis larger than 3 0 is referred as softening non gaussian process while the non gaussian process with kurtosis less than 3 0 is referred as hardening non gaussian process 2 2 translation process theory for the non gaussian stochastic wave the non gaussian stochastic wave can relate to the gaussian stochastic wave with the translation process theory and yields grigoriu 1995 5 z g x f z 1 φ x where z η n g μ n g σ n g and x η g μ g σ g are the standard non gaussian and gaussian stochastic wave respectively μ n g and μ g are the mean value of the non gaussian and gaussian stochastic wave and both of them approach to zero for the stationary process σ n g and σ g are the standard deviation of the non gaussian and gaussian stochastic wave and they are assumed to identical to the square root of zeroth moment of the specified psd g is the memoryless monotonic translation function f z and φ are the cdfs of non gaussian and gaussian stochastic wave and f z 1 is the inverse function of f z according to the principle of translation process theory the cdf of the non gaussian stochastic wave is identical to that of the gaussian stochastic wave exactly and the translation process is therefore referred as the probability preserving transformation 2 3 translation model for the softening non gaussian stochastic wave in general the standard non gaussian stochastic wave can be represented by a hermite polynomial expansion of the standard gaussian stochastic wave winterstein 1988 6 z κ x h 3 x 2 1 h 4 x 3 3 x where κ h 3 and h 4 are the coefficients of the translation model and they can be formed with the first four statistical moments of the non gaussian stochastic wave in the translation model the parameter κ is utilized to preserve the unit standard deviation and parameters h 3 and h 4 are used to fit the target cdf for the coefficients are related to the statistical moments of stochastic wave this translation model is also referred as moment based hermite model a closed form expression of the translation model coefficient which was obtained based on an optimal procedure to minimize the difference of target kurtosis and skewness with these from translation model can be given as 7 κ 1 1 2 h 3 2 6 h 4 2 h 3 s 6 1 0 015 s 0 3 s 2 1 0 2 k 3 h 4 h 40 1 1 43 s 2 k 3 1 0 1 k 0 8 h 40 1 1 25 k 3 1 3 1 10 where k and s are the kurtosis and skewness of the target non gaussian stochastic wave it has been proven that the above translation model is effective for mildly softening non gaussian stochastic wave but it is less effective for strongly softening non gaussian stochastic wave ding and chen 2014 in addition this translation model cannot be applicable for simulation of the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave and the skewed non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 3 0 ding and chen 2014 2 4 translation model for the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave a translation model for simulation of the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave was developed by ding and chen 2015 based on the orthogonal expansion of the stochastic wave and yields 8 z ξ 2 x c ξ x 1 3 ξ 2 x c ξ x 1 3 a 9 ξ x x 2 b 4 s 2 a 1 5 1 5 b a 2 a b 3 3 b 4 b b 2 b 3 s b 4 k 3 b 4 c b a 2 3 10 ϕ 1 0 06 3 k 1 3 b 2 ϕ 1 s 4 1 2 s 2 0 18 7 5 e 0 5 k b 3 0 8 s 5 s 3 0 77 s k 1 2 0 5 b 4 ϕ 0 04 11 5 s 4 6 8 s 2 3 5 s 2 0 4 2 0 15 the translation model provides a very convenient way for simulation of the softening and hardening non gaussian stochastic wave and the cdf of the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave agrees well with the target one with the probability preserving operation but the psd of the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave may deviate from the prescribed psd due to the nonlinear transformation therefore the cdf and psd of the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave cannot converge to the target cdf and psd simultaneously and the conventional spectral representation method possesses the incompatibility issue of the cdf and psd and the iterative procedure is needed to update the psd of the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave to fit the prescribed one 2 5 iterative procedure for updating the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave to make the psd of the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave to satisfy the prescribed one several methodologies have been developed such as the ones developed by yamazaki and shinozuka 1988 deodatis and micaletti 2001 bocchini and deodatis 2008 etc according to the iterative procedure proposed by yamazaki and shinozuka 1988 the psd s ˆ n g i of the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave is evaluated and compared with the prescribed psd s n g t ω if the evaluated psd s ˆ n g i deviate from the prescribed psd s n g t ω significantly the psd s g i 1 ω of the gaussian stochastic wave at the i 1 th iteration will be updated with the psd s g i ω of the gaussian stochastic wave at i th iteration and the evaluated psd s ˆ n g i of the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave at i th iteration and the prescribed psd s n g t ω of the non gaussian stochastic wave the psd for generating the gaussian stochastic wave at the i 1 th iteration can be given as 11 s g i 1 ω s g i ω s ˆ n g i ω s n g t ω i 1 2 3 n following the procedure illustrated in section 2 1 the gaussian stochastic wave at the i th iteration can be generated from the updated psd s g i ω and the same random phase angles then the gaussian stochastic wave is further mapped into the non gaussian stochastic wave with the translation model updating the psd of the gaussian stochastic wave in terms of eq 11 is performed for the following reasons the psd for each wave frequency changes due to the nonlinear transformation operation but the rate of the change at each wave frequency which is represented by the ratio s g i ω s ˆ n g i ω is expected to approach to a constant value as the iteration number i increases therefore deviation of the evaluated psd s ˆ n g i ω and the prescribed psd s n g t ω will disappear as the iteration number i increases the flow chart of the conventional spectral representation method for simulation of the stationary non gaussian stochastic wave is illustrated in fig 2 3 the modified straightforward method for simulation of the non gaussian stochastic wave referring to the principle of the conventional spectral representation method one can find that the conventional method is less effective for strongly softening and skewed non gaussian stochastic wave furthermore the conventional method possesses the incompatibility issue of the cdf and psd and the iterative procedure is needed to eliminate the psd distortion caused by the nonlinear transformation therefore the accuracy and efficiency of the conventional method need to be improved in this paper a modified spectral representation method which can simulate the strongly non gaussian stochastic wave in a straightforward manner without any need for iterations is developed for accurate and efficient simulation of the stationary non gaussian stochastic wave the proposed method involves five steps in the first step the parameters of the target non gaussian stochastic wave including the psd kurtosis k t and skewness s t related to the cdf are given in advance in the second step the gaussian stochastic wave is generated based on the given psd and a modified analytical translation model parameterized with the kurtosis k t and skewness s t is established in the third step the gaussian stochastic wave is mapped into the non gaussian stochastic wave with the aid of the established translation model in the fourth step the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave is decomposed into the random phase angles and amplitudes in the last step the target non gaussian stochastic wave is reconstructed with the random phase angles extracted from the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave and the amplitudes discretized from the specified psd in the proposed method the steps 2 and 3 are adopted to accurately construct the cdf of the target non gaussian stochastic wave and the steps 4 and 5 are utilized to make the psd of the target non gaussian stochastic wave to satisfy the specified one 3 1 the modified translation model for the softening non gaussian stochastic wave to make the cdf of the softening non gaussian stochastic wave to satisfy the target one accurately a modified analytical translation model parameterized with the kurtosis k t and skewness s t of the target non gaussian stochastic wave is provided in this paper and yields 12 z κ x h 3 x 2 1 h 4 x 3 3 x 13 κ 1 1 2 h 3 2 6 h 4 2 h 3 3 s t 4 2 1 1 5 k t 3 h 4 1 1 5 k t 3 1 8 65 0 01 h s t z where z η n g t t μ n g t σ n g t and x η g t μ g σ g are the standard non gaussian and gaussian stochastic wave respectively μ n g t and σ n g t are the mean value and standard deviation of the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave η n g t t μ g and σ g are the mean value and standard deviation of the gaussian stochastic wave respectively comparing with the conventional translation model proposed by winterstein 1988 one can find that the hermite polynomial expansion in the modified translation model adopted to relate the standard non gaussian and gaussian stochastic wave is same with that in the conventional method however the coefficients of the modified translation model are obviously different from the coefficients of the conventional translation model first of all the coefficients of the modified translation model which are obtained with the aid of the least square curve fitting method are so concisely and more rigorously compared with that of the conventional translation model next the effects of the input wave parameters including the significant wave height h s and the zero up crossing period t z are incorporated into the coefficients of the modified translation model to accurately simulate the strongly softening non gaussian stochastic wave finally the coefficients of the modified translation model always have physical meaning even for the extreme case with kurtosis of 3 0 and it means that the modified translation model outperforms the conventional translation model on applicability for example the modified translation model can be applicable to simulate the strongly skewed non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 3 0 while the conventional translation model cannot be applicable for simulation of the skewed non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 3 0 3 2 the modified translation model for the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave for the probability characteristics of the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave are different from that of the softening non gaussian stochastic wave the translation model for the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave is distinguished from that for the softening non gaussian stochastic wave a modified translation model for the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave is provided in this paper and it can be given as 14 z ξ 2 x c ξ x 1 3 ξ 2 x c ξ x 1 3 a 15 ξ x x 1 7 k t 3 3 b 4 s t 2 a 1 5 1 5 b a 2 a b 3 3 b 4 b b 2 b 3 s t b 4 k t 3 b 4 c b a 2 3 16 ϕ 1 0 06 3 k t 1 3 b 2 ϕ 1 s t 4 1 2 s t 2 0 18 7 5 e 0 5 k t b 3 0 8 s t 5 s t 3 0 77 s t k t 1 2 0 5 b 4 ϕ 0 04 11 5 s t 4 6 8 s t 2 3 5 k t 2 0 4 2 0 15 the closed form expressions of the coefficients associated with the modified translation model for the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave are obtained by means of the least square curve fitting method and they have similar expressions with the coefficients of the conventional translation model after a careful comparison between the coefficients of the modified and conventional translation model one can find that the kurtosis of the target non gaussian stochastic wave is incorporated into the expression of ξ x in the modified translation model for accurately simulation of the strongly hardening non gaussian stochastic wave 3 3 reconstruction of the target non gaussian stochastic wave the cdf of the non gaussian stochastic wave is not only related to the psd but also related to the random phase angles for a gaussian stochastic wave the random phase angles are mutual independent and uniformly distributed in 0 2 π however for a non gaussian stochastic wave the random phase angles are not mutual independent and not follow uniform distribution in 0 2 π it should be mentioned that the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave is independent from the random phase angles and it has slight influence on the probability characteristics of the non gaussian stochastic wave grigoriu 2009 therefore to eliminate the psd distortion caused by the nonlinear transformation the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave can be decomposed into the random phase angles and amplitudes and the target non gaussian stochastic wave can be reconstructed with the random phase angles extracted from the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave and the amplitudes discretized from the prescribed psd with the aid of fft algorithm the extracted random phase angles ϕ n g t of the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave and the reconstructed target non gaussian stochastic wave η n g t can be given as 17 ϕ n g t a n g l e fft η n g t t 18 η n g t r e n 1 n a n e i ω n t ϕ n g t where ϕ n g t are the random phase angles extracted from the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave and a n are the amplitudes discretized from the specified psd see eq 1 η n g t is the reconstructed target non gaussian stochastic wave with the psd identical to the prescribed one the flow chart of the proposed method is illustrated in fig 3 in the proposed method the cdf of the non gaussian stochastic wave agrees well with the target cdf for the modified translation model is a monotonic function and the transformation procedure is the probability preserving operation the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave is identical to the prescribed one since it is reconstructed with the amplitudes discretized from the specified psd the proposed method has advantages of immune the incompatibility issue of the cdf and psd and it can be used to simulate the non gaussian stochastic wave based on the prescribed psd and target kurtosis and skewness without any need for iterations therefore the proposed method is referred as the modified straightforward spectral representation method in this paper in contrast to the conventional method the proposed method is simple and efficient and can be used to simulate the hardening softening and skewed non gaussian stochastic wave accurately it provides a useful tool to investigate the influence of non gaussian stochastic wave on the extreme dynamic response and fatigue damage of offshore structures 4 numerical studies and discussions to fully investigate the effectiveness of the proposed straightforward spectral representation method the non gaussian stochastic wave with different psds and target kurtosis and skewness are simulated and the accuracy efficiency and convergence of the proposed method are validated with the conventional method 4 1 environmental conditions for clearly illustrating the validation of the proposed method three different sea states namely benign moderate and harsh sea states are adopted in this study to simulate the non gaussian stochastic wave with different kurtosis and skewness two widely used spectra namely jonswap narrowband spectrum and torsethaugen two peaked broadband spectrum are adopted to characterize the psd of the input sea states dnvgl 2014 the wave parameters of the selected sea states are summarized in table 1 4 2 elevation of the non gaussian stochastic wave the elevation of the non gaussian stochastic wave is distinguished from that of the gaussian stochastic wave and the difference of the wave elevation may have significant influence on the cdf and psd of the stochastic wave in this section the gaussian and non gaussian stochastic wave with different kurtosis and psds are simulated with the proposed and conventional methods two typical cases a hardening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 2 0 and a softening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 5 0 under the moderate sea state are selected for demonstration both the long period and short period wave elevation are provided to clearly illustrate the discrepancies of gaussian and non gaussian stochastic wave as illustrated in figs 4 and 5 respectively the long period stochastic wave elevation is composed of 131072 sample points at 0 1s interval while the short period stochastic wave elevation is a segment of the long period wave elevation which is composed of 1000 sample points at 0 1 s interval from fig 4 one can find that the wave elevation of the gaussian and non gaussian stochastic wave generated from the conventional method shows similar variation trends because the translation model in the conventional method can preserve the random phase angles of stochastic wave however the wave elevation of the non gaussian stochastic wave is distinguished from that of the gaussian stochastic wave at wave crests and troughs for the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 2 0 the wave elevation of the non gaussian stochastic wave is much smaller than that of the gaussian stochastic wave at the wave crests near simulation time of 1125 s 5545 s and 11988 s nevertheless for the softening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 5 0 the wave elevation of the non gaussian stochastic wave is much larger than that of the gaussian stochastic wave at the wave crests near simulation time of 1125 s 5545 s and 11988 s therefore one can deduce that the occurrence probability of the wave elevation larger than 3 σ in the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave is much smaller than that in the gaussian stochastic wave while the occurrence probability of the wave elevation larger than 3 σ in the softening non gaussian stochastic wave is much larger than that in the gaussian stochastic wave different from the wave elevation associated with the conventional simulation method the elevations of the hardening and softening non gaussian stochastic wave generated from the proposed method show different variation trends with the gaussian stochastic wave as illustrated in fig 5 the reason is that the non gaussian stochastic wave related to the proposed method is reconstructed with the random phase angles extracted from the transformed non gaussian stochastic wave and the amplitudes discretized from the prescribed psd and there may exist phase difference between the reconstructed non gaussian stochastic wave and the gaussian stochastic wave therefore the crests troughs of the gaussian and non gaussian stochastic wave do not occur simultaneously and the elevation of the gaussian and non gaussian stochastic wave cannot be compared at the crests troughs directly in this study the non gaussian stochastic wave elevation at the crests troughs are compared with the gaussian stochastic wave at the next adjacent crests troughs by taking the phase lag into consideration as can been seen from fig 5 the phenomenon that softening non gaussian stochastic wave elevation over the gaussian and hardening non gaussian stochastic wave elevation at the crests occurs many times however this phenomenon does not occur at every crest for the energy distribution of the gaussian and non gaussian stochastic wave are identical therefore from a statistical point of view one can conclude that the elevation of hardening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 2 0 is generally smaller than that of the gaussian stochastic wave at the specific crests and troughs and the elevation of the softening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 5 0 is generally larger than that of the gaussian stochastic wave at the specific crests and troughs 4 3 the accuracy of the proposed method to investigate the accuracy of the proposed method the kurtosis and skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave generated from the proposed method are evaluated and compared with the target kurtosis and skewness for clearly illustrating the accuracy of the proposed method two different scenarios are analyzed the first scenario is that the target skewness is set to 0 0 and the target kurtosis ranges from 2 0 to 10 0 at 0 2 interval and the accuracy of the proposed method for simulation of the hardening and softening non gaussian stochastic wave is investigated the second scenario is that the target kurtosis is set to 3 5 and the target skewness varies from 0 5 to 0 5 at 0 1 interval and the accuracy of the proposed method for simulation of the skewed non gaussian stochastic is analyzed to have a good understanding of the accuracy of the proposed method the kurtosis and skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave simulated with the conventional method under these two scenarios are also investigated it should be mentioned that the conventional method cannot be applicable to simulate the skewed non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 3 0 and hence the target kurtosis is set to 3 5 in the second scenario in the first scenario the kurtosis and the skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave generated from the proposed and conventional methods under the moderate sea state are presented in fig 6 in the figure the dash lines are the reference lines where the kurtosis skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave is identical to the target kurtosis skewness and it is regarded as a benchmark to reveal the accuracy of the simulation methods the results with square marker are the kurtosis skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave associated with the conventional method while the results with circle marker are the kurtosis skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave related to the proposed method for the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave case the kurtosis and skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave generated from the proposed and conventional methods are almost identical to the target kurtosis and skewness for all the cited kurtosis this indicates that both the proposed and the conventional methods can simulate the strongly hardening non gaussian stochastic wave accurately however it should be mentioned that the performance of the proposed method outperforms the conventional method on efficiency since the target non gaussian stochastic wave can be simulated with the proposed method in a straightforward manner without any need for iterations for the softening non gaussian stochastic wave case the kurtosis of the non gaussian stochastic wave generated from the conventional method deviates from the target kurtosis significantly the evaluated kurtosis is smaller than the target kurtosis when the target kurtosis is smaller than 7 0 while the evaluated kurtosis becomes larger than the target kurtosis when the target kurtosis is larger than 7 0 it is worth noting that the deviation level of the evaluated and target kurtosis increases dramatically as the target kurtosis increases from 7 0 to infinite however different from the results associated with the conventional method the kurtosis of the non gaussian stochastic wave generated from the proposed method is in perfect agreement with the target kurtosis for all the cited kurtosis this means that the proposed method can simulate the mildly and strongly softening non gaussian stochastic wave accurately while the conventional method cannot simulate the strongly softening non gaussian stochastic wave accurately in addition the skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave generated from the conventional and proposed methods are close to but slightly smaller than the target skewness and the deviation level between the evaluated and target skewness increases slightly as the target kurtosis increases this means that the skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave is related to the kurtosis of the non gaussian stochastic wave and the strongly softening non gaussian stochastic wave with skewness of 0 0 cannot be simulated effectively in the second scenario the target kurtosis is set to 3 5 and the skewness varies from 0 5 to 0 5 at 0 1 interval the kurtosis and skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave simulated with the proposed and conventional methods under the moderate sea state are illustrated in fig 7 from the figure one can find that the skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave generated from the proposed and conventional methods are very close to but not identical to the target skewness however after a careful comparison between the evaluated skewness related to the proposed and conventional methods one can find the differences on one hand the evaluated skewness of the conventional method deviates from the target skewness as the target skewness increases or decreases from zero to infinite on the other hand the evaluated skewness of the proposed method is consistently close to the target skewness for all the cited skewness the accuracy of the proposed method for simulation of the highly skewed non gaussian stochastic wave is better than the conventional method in addition one can also find that the kurtosis of the non gaussian stochastic wave is closely related to the skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave for the conventional method case the kurtosis of the non gaussian stochastic wave increases as the target skewness increases or decreases from zero to infinite and it is always much smaller than the target kurtosis it should be mentioned that the target kurtosis is set to 3 5 in this scenario and the largest discrepancy between the evaluated and target kurtosis is about 1 3 for the proposed method case the kurtosis of the non gaussian stochastic wave is always larger than the target kurtosis the largest discrepancy of the evaluated and target kurtosis associated with the proposed method is about 0 7 which is much smaller than that of the conventional method in general the performance of the proposed method outperforms the conventional method on accuracy and the hardening softening and skewed non gaussian stochastic wave can be simulated with the proposed method accurately referring to the results associated with the jonswap and torsethaugen spectra one can find that the evaluated kurtosis skewness of the non gaussian stochastic wave under the torsethaugen spectrum is very close to but slightly larger than that under the jonswap spectrum for a specific target kurtosis skewness this indicates that the proposed method works as well for both narrowband and broadband spectra 4 4 the convergence and efficiency of the proposed method the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave may deviate from the target one due to the nonlinear transformation which may have significant influence on the fatigue damage of the structure and more attention should be paid to the convergence characteristics of the psd to investigate the convergence of the proposed method the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave simulated with the conventional and proposed methods are evaluated and compared with the specified psd two representative cases the softening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 5 0 and 7 0 under moderate sea state are selected for demonstration the comparison results of the evaluated and target psds associated with the conventional and proposed methods are presented in figs 8 and 9 respectively for clearly illustrating the discrepancies of the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave and the specified psd the ordinates of the figures are presented in the logarithmic form from fig 8 a and b one can find that the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave is not identical to the specified psd for the conventional method it is notable that the deviation level of the evaluated and specified psd increases as the kurtosis of the non gaussian stochastic wave increases one can also find that the evaluated psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave will approach to the specified psd gradually with the aid of the iterative procedure but it will not be exactly identical to the specified one especially for the low frequency and high frequency components for the mildly softening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 5 0 the evaluated psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave converges to the specified psd with 2 iterations while the evaluated psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave converges to the specified psd after 46 iterations for the strongly softening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 7 0 similar characteristics and variation trend can be observed in fig 9 a and b this indicates that the efficiency of the conventional method decreases as the non gaussianity of the stochastic wave becomes strong as can be seen from figs 8 c and fig 9 c the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave generated from the proposed method is exactly identical to the specified psd for the mildly and strongly softening non gaussian stochastic wave whether the input psd is a narrowband or a broadband spectrum this means that the proposed method is capable of reliably converging to the specified psd and it has robustness to the mildly and strongly non gaussian stochastic wave for the cdf of the non gaussian stochastic wave matches well with the target one and the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave satisfies the prescribed one and the cdf of the non gaussian stochastic wave therefore is compatible well with the psd of the non gaussian stochastic wave without any need for iterations in this proposed method these features make the proposed method to be useful tool for the engineering problems involving the stochastic wave where the gaussian assumption is not appropriate 4 5 the probability distribution of the non gaussian stochastic wave to further investigate the applicability of the proposed method the hardening softening and skewed non gaussian stochastic wave under the benign moderate and harsh sea states are simulated with the proposed method and the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave is evaluated and compared with the gaussian distribution 4 5 1 hardening non gaussian stochastic wave the histogram of the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 2 5 is presented in fig 10 in the figure the bars represent the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave elevation and the line is the gaussian distribution parameterized with mean value μ and standard deviation σ of the stochastic wave there are two features worthy of attention in the figure on one hand the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave is symmetrical about its mean value but it deviates from the gaussian distribution significantly taking the non gaussian stochastic wave under the moderate sea state for example the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave is much smaller than the gaussian distribution when the wave elevation is smaller than 0 65 σ or larger than 2 0 σ σ is the standard deviation of the stochastic wave nevertheless the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave is much larger than the gaussian distribution when the wave elevation is between 0 65 σ and 2 0 σ on the other hand the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave shows similar characteristics for the benign moderate and harsh sea states however the turn points where the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave becomes larger than the gaussian distribution are slightly difference for the benign moderate and harsh sea states according to the comparison results one can find that the occurrence probability of the wave elevation larger than 2 0 σ in hardening non gaussian stochastic wave is much smaller than that in gaussian stochastic wave therefore the extreme response as well as the fatigue damage of the structure may be overestimated if a hardening non gaussian stochastic wave is simplified as a gaussian stochastic wave 4 5 2 softening non gaussian stochastic wave for softening non gaussian stochastic waves with kurtosis of 5 0 and 7 0 the histograms of the wave elevations are illustrated in figs 11 and 12 respectively from the figures one can see that the histograms of the softening non gaussian stochastic wave with kurtosis of 5 0 and 7 0 show similar characteristics for the benign moderate and harsh sea states and both of them are symmetrical about its mean value however the histogram of the softening non gaussian stochastic wave is distinguished from the histogram of the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave obviously taking the softening non gaussian stochastic wave under moderate sea state as an example the histogram of the softening non gaussian stochastic wave is much larger than the gaussian distribution when the wave elevation is smaller than 0 68 σ or larger than 2 5 σ while the histogram of the wave elevation becomes slightly smaller than the gaussian distribution for the wave elevation between 0 68 σ and 2 5 σ furthermore the discrepancies between the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave and the gaussian distribution increase as the kurtosis increases from 5 0 to 7 0 in addition the turn points where the histogram of the softening non gaussian stochastic wave becomes larger than the gaussian distribution are slightly difference for the benign moderate and harsh sea states it should be mentioned that the occurrence probability of the wave elevation over 2 5 σ in softening non gaussian stochastic wave is much larger than that in gaussian stochastic wave and it may cause the extreme dynamic response and accelerate the fatigue damage of structure significantly therefore the extreme dynamic response and the fatigue damage of the structure may be underestimated if a softening non gaussian stochastic wave is simplified as a gaussian stochastic wave 4 5 3 skewed non gaussian stochastic wave for the skewed non gaussian stochastic wave with the skewness of 0 5 the histogram of the wave elevation is presented in fig 13 it can be seen from the figure that the histogram of the skewed non gaussian stochastic wave also deviates from the gaussian distribution significantly however different from the histogram of the hardening and softening non gaussian stochastic wave the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave with the skewness of 0 5 is asymmetrical about its mean value for wave troughs case the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave is much larger than the gaussian distribution when the wave elevation is smaller than 1 53 σ and the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave becomes smaller than the gaussian distribution as the wave elevation increases however for wave crests case the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave is much smaller than the gaussian distribution when the wave elevation is smaller than 1 72 σ and the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave becomes larger than the gaussian distribution as the wave elevation increases in addition the turn points where the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave becomes larger or smaller than the gaussian distribution are slightly difference for the benign moderate and harsh sea states and the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave with skewness of 0 5 usually has a long tail in the wave crest side the deviation of the skewed non gaussian and gaussian stochastic wave may have influence on the extreme dynamic response and fatigue damage of the structure referring to the comparison results one can find that the histograms of the non gaussian stochastic waves show similar characteristics for the benign moderate and harsh sea states but all of them deviate from the gaussian distribution significantly for the hardening non gaussian stochastic wave the probability of the wave elevation larger than 2 0 σ is much smaller than that of the gaussian distribution while for the softening non gaussian stochastic wave the probability of the wave elevation larger than 2 5 σ is much larger than that of the gaussian distribution therefore the dynamic response and the fatigue damage of the structure to the non gaussian stochastic wave are distinguished from these to the gaussian stochastic wave definitely and more attention should be paid to the engineering problems involving stochastic wave where the gaussian assumption is not appropriate 5 conclusions in this paper a modified straightforward spectral representation method is developed for accurate and efficient simulation of the non gaussian stochastic wave in the proposed method a modified analytical translation model is provided to accurately construct the cdf of the target non gaussian stochastic wave and an improved stochastic wave decomposition and reconstruction procedure is adopted to eliminate the psd distortion caused by the nonlinear transformation the proposed method has advantages of avoiding the incompatibility issue between the cdf and psd and simulating the non gaussian stochastic wave in a straightforward manner without any need for iterations the effectiveness of the proposed method has been numerically validated according to the study of this paper some main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the proposed method is a useful tool for simulation of the hardening softening and skewed non gaussian stochastic wave and the cdf as well as the psd of the target non gaussian stochastic wave are in perfect agreement with the target ones the proposed method is robust efficient and accurate within engineering expectations 2 the histogram of the non gaussian stochastic wave deviates from the gaussian distribution significantly and the deviation level increases as the kurtosis and skewness of non gaussian stochastic wave increase more attention should be paid to the engineering problems involving stochastic wave where the gaussian assumption is not appropriate credit authorship

21901,the nonlinear hydroelastic interaction between a solitary wave and a submerged box with elastic upper surface plate is investigated in a 2d numerical wave flume the objective is to investigate how hydroelasticity affects the interaction process the numerical wave flume solves incompressible navier stokes equations with a volume of fluid method for free surface simulation the linear elastic structure dynamic equations are solved by a finite element method and embedded into the solution of flow field by using a monolithic fluid structure interaction algorithm the numerical method is thoroughly verified against existing experiments and numerical simulations a series of numerical tests are conducted which contains free vibrations of the plate and the interaction between solitary waves and submerged boxes with various wave amplitudes and submerged depths results obtained with and without considering hydroelasticity are compared to investigate the influence of hydroelastic effect on the wave load the structure response and the flow field fast fourier transform and wavelet transform are adopted to reveal the oscillatory features of the interaction process some meaningful conclusions are drawn such as hydroelasticity changes the amplitude and period of the oscillatory motion and the variation of the oscillatory frequency can be approximated by a simple still water prediction method keywords solitary wave submerged box wave structure interaction hydroelastic effect structure response 1 introduction flat plate structure is widely applied in the field of coastal and ocean engineering many complex structures such as bridges floating docks offshore airports submerged breakwaters sea ice etc are composed of flat plate structures due to strong nonlinearity and complex wave overtopping and slamming effects usually it is expensive and time consuming to study the interaction between waves and complex structures however if the complex structures such as submerged breakwaters can be idealized as flat plates without inducing much error the problem will be greatly simplified since both experiments and numerical simulations can be performed with much lower cost solitary waves being explained by the shallow water korteweg de vries kdv equations are inherently nonlinear waves and the analytical solution of the interaction between solitary waves and plates is difficult to find therefore existing research on these problems mainly relies on experiments and numerical solutions the preliminary experiment on solitary wave plate interaction was conducted by kulin 1958 in which wave forces upon a submerged plate were measured without considering green water effects french 1970 studied solitary wave loads on elevated horizontal platforms by experiment recently lau et al 2011 performed a set of experiments to measure solitary wave forces acting on a coastal bridge model lo and liu 2013 investigated the wave scattering of a solitary wave travelling over a submerged horizontal plate by experiments in a wave flume seiffert et al 2014 studied the horizontal and vertical forces acting on a two dimensional horizontal plate due to solitary waves by conducting a series of laboratory experiments and investigated the influence of wave amplitudes water depth and submergence depth of the plate zaghian et al 2017 investigated the interaction of a solitary wave and a submerged thin plate through experiments in which velocity and vorticity were measured by using the particle image velocimetry piv technique and the influence of thin plate angle on wave height and wave speed was analyzed wang et al 2018 conducted a series of laboratory experiments on internal solitary wave isw loads upon semi submersible platforms in a density stratified fluid tank and investigated the load components induced by different factors chang et al 2018 experimentally investigated the interaction between a solitary wave and a thin submerged plate with various inclinations and analyzed the wave deformations and formed vortex patterns during the interaction process compared against experiments numerical simulation gives more information of the fluid field and is more convenient to be conducted utilizing the mixed eulerian lagrangian method for the free surface flow and the finite element method fem for the deflection of an elastic plate he and kashiwagi 2012 numerically simulated the hydroelastic behavior of a vertical plate due to solitary waves seiffert et al 2014 investigated solitary wave loads upon a horizontal plate through numerical simulations which adopted the interfoam solver in the openfoam cfd package to solve euler s equations using the same numerical technique hayatdavoodi et al 2014 studied the interaction between solitary waves and a deck with girders and examined the role of girders on the forces by making comparison against loads induced by flat plates hayatdavoodi et al 2017 simulated the transformation of solitarys and cnoidal waves over a submerged fixed horizontal rigid plate by use of the nonlinear shallow water level i green naghdi gn equations and investigated the nonlinear wave scattering effects under a variety of circumstances using the moving particle semi implicit method for fluid solution and fem for structure solution rao and wan 2018 simulated the process of solitary wave impacting onto a horizontal elastic plate which was placed certain distance above the still water surface level chang et al 2018 simulated the interaction between a solitary wave and a thin submerged inclined plate by numerical simulation in which the flow field wave profiles and induced forces were computed by applying a streamfunction vorticity formulations with free surface svfs model you et al 2019 investigated the nonlinear interaction between solitary waves and a submerged flat plate in a multi phase numerical viscous wave flume which was constructed based on a constrained interpolation profile cip scheme for solving navier stokes equations and a tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc scheme for free surface processing the present study numerically simulates the nonlinear interaction between solitary waves and a submerged box with an elastic upper surface as the interaction between solitary waves and rigid bodies has been investigated a lot the present study focuses on the dynamic response of structures and the hydroelastic effect the aim is to reveal how hydroelasticity affects the behavior of structures and the entire interaction process and to help understand the hydroelastic vibration of structures subject to nonlinear waves to achieve this goal two groups of simulations are conducted in a numerical wave tank nwt with a solver for fluid structure interaction fsi issues the first group simulates the fsi process when a solitary wave encounters a submerged box whose upper surface is an elastic flat plate by contrast in the second group the fluid load is firstly obtained by simulating the issue under the rigid body assumption and then imposed upon the elastic plate for the calculation of structure response the two groups of simulations are compared comprehensively in order to investigate the influence of hydroelastic effect the content of the paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a concise introduction on the numerical methods used in the study which contains fundamentals of the fluid solver and the fsi method and the setup of the nwt including wave generation and absorption method section 3 validates the numerical methods by generating solitary waves and simulating the issue of solitary waves meeting rigid submerged boxes the simulation results are compared against the solitary wave theory experimental results and existing numerical simulations the main simulation results of the present study are presented and analyzed in section 4 which is separated into 5 subsections subsection 4 1 performs free dissipation tests of structures in still water and obtains some natural vibration features of the simulated problems subsection 4 2 4 3 and 4 4 discuss characters of the wave load the structure response and the flow field during the interaction process the influence of parameters involving wave amplitudes and submerged depths is discussed in subsection 4 5 the conclusions of the study are reported in section 5 2 numerical method 2 1 fluid solver the nwt solves 2d navier stokes equations of incompressible newtonian fluid and adopts a vof youngs method youngs 1982 for free surface reconstruction the governing equations are 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i g i υ x j u i x j u j x i 3 f t u i f x i 0 eqs 1 3 are the continuity equation the momentum equation and the fluid volume transportation equation respectively subscript i and j are index tensor notations and the summation convention is adopted u i is the velocity vector component p is pressure g i is the gravitational acceleration vector component υ is the coefficient of kinematic viscosity and f is the fluid volume function which is used in the vof method five sorts of boundary conditions are used in the nwt i e the non slide solid wall condition free surface condition wave generation condition open boundary condition and the fluid structure interface condition the non slide wall condition forces the velocity to be zero at the boundary the free surface boundary indicates that no shear stress exists upon the free water surface shear stress from air is not considered in the simulation and the normal stress is a constant in 2 dimensional space this condition can be expressed as 4 u n τ u τ n 0 5 p 2 μ u n n p 0 where subscript n and τ denote velocity components along the tangent and normal direction of the free surfaces respectively p 0 is the constant pressure upon free surface and μ is the coefficient of dynamic viscosity there are basically two kinds of wave generation methods in nwts the first kind of method generates waves by setting the boundary condition of the computing domain it can be a moving solid wall boundary imitating the pushing paddle or rotating paddle of the physical wave tank troch and rouck 1999 ren et al 2008 lara et al 2011 or simply a fixed inlet boundary with velocity and pressure of the boundary determined relying on the target wave hu et al 2017 another wave generation method is by introducing source terms into the momentum equations or the continuity equation for instance lin and liu 1999 developed an internal wave maker method with a mass source function choi and yoon 2009 utilized a momentum source function to generate waves in a 2 d and 3 d wave basin the present study uses the first method by setting a fixed wave inlet boundary at the left end of the wave flume the advantage of this method is low computation cost and easy implementation the velocity and pressure of the inlet boundary are directly given by the analytical solution of solitary waves at the right end of the nwt an open boundary is installed to let waves pass through freely without causing reflection the open boundary condition can be formulated as 6 r t c r x 0 where r represents any wave related quantity such as surface elevation velocity and pressure c is the wave travelling velocity phase velocity which should be calculated properly in order to reach a good wave passing effect in this paper c is also given by the analytical solution of solitary waves compared with the sponge layer absorber which is another popular wave absorption method the open boundary requires no additional absorption region thus reducing the computational consumption hu et al 2015 the fluid structure interface condition will be discussed later since it is related to the fsi algorithm the pressure gradient term and diffusion term of eq 2 are discretized with the central difference scheme cds and the convention term with a mixed central and upwind difference scheme uds time derivative is discretized with a forward euler scheme with first order accuracy the coupled velocity pressure equation is solved with a simple two step projection method which first calculates a temporary velocity field and then correcting it by determining a pressure field such that the mass conservation equation is satisfied if the velocity field u i n at moment n δ t is given with δ t denoting time step length the temporary velocity field u i and the corrected velocity field u i n 1 at moment n 1 δ t are further given by 7 u i u i n δ t u j n u i n x j g i n υ x j u i n x j u j n x i 8 u i n 1 u i δ t 1 ρ p n 1 x i the pressure field at moment n 1 δ t is determined by substituting eq 8 into eq 1 yielding a poisson equation as follows 9 x i 1 ρ p n 1 x i 1 δ t u i x i eq 9 is solved by using a successive over relaxation sor iteration method 2 2 fsi method a monolithic implicit fsi method based on simple algorithm is utilized to account for the hydroelastic interaction between solitary waves and elastic plates detailed description of the method including theoretical formulation numerical implementation convergence study and validation can be found in hu et al 2016 here we present the basic idea and the foundational equations of the fsi method without going into details the fem is used for structure solution in a 2 dimensional nwt plates can be simplified as beams and are further divided into euler bernoulli beam elements which contain two degrees of freedom translational and rotational displacement at each node by introducing a lumped mass matrix and proportional damping matrix the dynamic structural equation in a fem form can be written as 10 m w c w k w f where w is the nodal deformation vector w and w represent the vector of nodal velocity and nodal acceleration respectively m c and k are the global matrix of mass damping and stiffness and f stands for the nodal force vector which is fluid load in the present study the houbolt scheme an unconditionally stable implicit multi step scheme with 4 order accuracy is employed for temporal discretization the discretized equation is formulated as 11 2 a 1 m 11 a 2 c k w t δ t f t δ t 5 a 1 m 18 a 2 c w t 4 a 1 m 9 a 2 c w t δ t a 1 m 2 a 2 c w t 2 δ t where a 1 1 δ t 2 and a 2 1 6 δ t the fluid structure interface condition can be described as the continuity of force and velocity which is written as 12 v f s s t 13 σ f n t s where v f and σ f are the fluid velocity and stress tensor at the fluid structure interface s s and t s are the structure deformation and distributed load at the fluid structure interface n is the interface normal since the viscous force is much smaller than the normal force you et al 2019 the left side of eq 13 can be simplified as p i where i is unit tensor by performing certain interpolation between fluid grid points and structure nodes above relationships can be rewritten as 14 u q 1 w 15 q 2 p f f where u and p are velocity and pressure of grid points at fluid structure interface f f is fluid induced nodal force on fem nodes q 1 and q 2 are interpolation matrix after the fluid structure interface equations eq 14 and eq 15 are established the structure solution is first embedded into the sor iteration of fluid in which the relationship between u and p is constructed then by considering the additional damping effect of fluid at each iterative step the structural dynamic equation is modified as 16 m w c c f w k w f r where c f is the additional damping matrix induced by the flow field finally the modified structural equation is solved using the houbolt scheme together with the sor iteration of fluid pressure poisson equation solving fluid and structure simultaneously rather than one after another the fsi method exhibits fast convergence rate and is suitable for solving transient impact problems 2 3 nwt setup the schematic diagram of the nwt is shown in fig 1 following the experiment conducted by seiffert et al 2014 and numerical simulation by you et al 2019 the tank length is 15 m the tank height is 0 15 m and the water depth is h 0 086 m a hollow watertight box structure which can be widely found in coastal and ocean engineering is submerged in the center zone of the nwt the thickness of the box is t 0 013 m and the distance between the wave inlet boundary and the leading edge of the box is l1 8 m 4 normalized incoming wave heights a h 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 and 4 normalized submergence depths d h 0 1 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 of the upper face of the box are selected two wave gauges are placed in the nwt with wg1 0 610 m upstream of the leading edge of the box and wg2 0 610 m downstream of the rear edge of the box the upper surface plate of the submerged box which is greatly affected by the solitary wave is assumed to be rigid or elastic the physical parameters of the elastic plate are chosen such that only small deformation is induced during the interaction process and therefore a linear fem can be used for structure simulation table 1 lists main parameters of the fluid and the plate it should be noted that only the typical parameter combinations are simulated in this study as the fsi simulation of all the parameter combinations is time consuming 3 validation in order to verify the numerical method a series of numerical tests are conducted including generation of solitary waves and simulation of solitary waves travelling through rigid submerged boxes the simulation results are compared against theoretical solution experimental results and other numerical results 3 1 convergence test this subsection gives a short test on the influence of simulation controlling parameters such as the mesh size and the time step length in the test the wave height of the solitary wave is a 0 3h and the submerged depth of the box is d 0 2h three groups of parameter combinations are tested the uniform mesh is used the cpu of the machine is intel xeon e5 2650 2 20 ghz with 128 gb available ram details of the parameter combinations as well as the time consumption are listed in table 2 fig 2 shows the surface records at wg1 simulated using various parameter combinations with and without the existence of the submerged box fig 3 compares the wave force upon the submerged box and fig 4 depicts displacement of the center point of the supper surface plate in figs 2 4 the simulation results of all the parameter combinations show good agreement with each other although little difference can be observed at the curve peaks or troughs this means the time step length and the grid size are small enough to reach a convergent solution therefore we use parameter combination 1 throughout the rest of the paper due to its smaller time consumption 3 2 solitary wave generation four solitary waves which will be used later are first generated in the nwt fig 5 compares surface histories obtained by numerical simulation and the solitary wave theory which can be found in many works say seiffert et al 2014 the numerical and theoretical results show very good agreement indicating that the simulated solitary waves can be further used for simulating wave structure interaction fig 6 depicts solitary wave surface measured at different wave gauges the wave contour remains stable while travelling which is another evidence of solitary waves being properly generated in fig 6 after solitary wave leaves only small fluctuation of free surface can be observed this indicates that the open boundary is efficient and the solitary waves pass through the open boundary with no reflection 3 3 interaction between solitary wave and rigid submerged box following the experiment of seiffert et al 2014 and the numerical simulation of you et al 2019 we perform several groups of numerical tests fig 7 compares the simulated non dimensional surface elevations against the experimental results of seiffert et al 2014 and the numerical results of you et al 2019 with submerged depth d h 0 2 and wave amplitude a h changing from 0 1 to 0 4 fig 8 selects 6 snapshots of wave profiles covering the main process of the solitary wave structure interaction with submerged depth d h 0 2 and wave amplitude a h 0 3 the snapshots are also compared with those given by you et al 2019 fig 9 contrasts the simulated global wave force upon the submerged box with the numerical results of you et al 2019 from figs 7 9 it is found that all the simulation results present good agreement with experiments and other numerical results this means our numerical method can correctly simulate the interaction between solitary waves and submerged box some interesting phenomena happen when solitary waves meet a submerged box since you et al 2019 has already given a thorough investigation in the interaction between solitary waves and a submerged box here we only give a brief review on the interaction process without going into details this is helpful for the understanding of hydroelastic interaction process which is the main focus of this work when a solitary wave reaches the leading edge of the submerged box a reflection wave is first formed due to the blocking effect of the left edge of the box the solitary wave then splits into two waves i e the back wave left and the front wave right which can be clearly observed in subplot b and c of fig 8 the back wave gets reflected while the front wave continues travelling forward in the meanwhile the front wave changes from a symmetry soliton into an asymmetry wave with a very steep front and a relatively flat back this process is coupled with strong nonlinear effects such as surface overturning wave breaking and the formation of vortices fig 10 gives the evolution of vorticity at various moments calculated with a h 0 4 and d h 0 2 which also exhibits good agreement with you s simulation results two kinds of vorticity exist in the flow field which correspond to the overturning of free surface and the rotational vortex around the vertexes of box a couple of small periodical waves are generated after the front wave passes in fig 7 these waves correspond to the small fluctuation behind the main peaks of surface history curves measured at wg2 3 4 structure solution test this subsection conducts numerical simulation on a classical water entry issue the purpose is to gives a simple test and verification on the structure solution and fsi algorithm of the numerical method the test is short due to the space limitation of the article and detailed investigations on the features of the numerical method can be found in hu et al 2016 the issue is the water entry of an elastic flat plate which is a common phenomenon in ship industry and ocean engineering faltinsen et al 1997 and kvålsvold and faltinsen 1995 studied the water impact on an elastic horizontal plate and gave a series of experimental measurements as well as numerical the theoretical results here we do similar numerical simulations and make comparison with existing results the computational domain is 2 m 2 m with 6400 grids the water depth is 1 5 m with a horizontal plate hitting on the free surface as is shown in fig 11 since the length of the plate is far longer than its width in the experiment the plate could be simplified as a lath beam in 2 d space to capture the transient response of the plate the time interval is 0 00001s and the total simulation time is 0 025s the plate with a length of 0 5 m is divided into 20 euler elements and enters water with the velocity corresponding to a dropping height of 0 5 m the basic parameters are selected according to the experiment of faltinsen et al 1997 and are listed in table 3 fig 12 illustrates the deflection of the plate center in our simulation with comparisons against the theoretical results of faltinsen et al 1997 and the numerical results of kvålsvold and faltinsen 1995 as is shown in fig 12 the present simulation results agree well with the numerical results of kvålsvold and faltinsen 1995 the agreement with the theoretical results is also good in general despite the maximum deflection of our simulation is smaller than the theoretical prediction in fig 12 b the present simulation is found to be closer to the experiment measurement which is listed in table 4 table 4 lists the maximum deflections and velocities obtained using different methods with their deviation against the experimental records of faltinsen et al 1997 it is found that our simulation and the numerical simulation of kvålsvold and faltinsen 1995 show similar precision both presenting good agreement with the experiment yet the theory shows relatively large deviation against the experiment 4 results and discussion 4 1 free vibration in still water added mass and damping effect will be induced for a moving body rigid or elastic in water fig 13 shows the nodal displacements of the center of the upper surface plate during free vibration in still water and air the initial displacement and velocity are 0 the submerged depth is d h 0 1 for the convenience of comparison the load is hydrostatic pressure plus added mass damping induced load in the water and hydrostatic pressure alone in the air it is obvious that the natural vibration period of the plate in still water becomes longer than that in air due to the added mass effect the dry and wet natural periods are 0 0175s and 0 0245s respectively namely a magnification of 1 40 water also changes the damping rate of the vibration in the present fsi method a rational damping matrix is used with the definition c α m β k where α 0 00003 and β 0 00012 corresponding to a damping ratio of 0 021 the rational damping matrix leads to an exponentially decaying pattern of the vibratory amplitude following the free vibration theory the decaying function of mode j is e λ j t where damping factor λ j α β ω j 2 2 and ω j is the j th natural angular frequency for free vibration in air the theory leads to a damping factor of λ 1 7 71 the damping factor can also be numerically predicted by analyzing the amplitude damping curves of fig 13 for free vibration in air the amplitude damping curve leads to λ 1 7 72 which highly agrees with the theory for free vibration in water since the natural frequency is changed the theory gives a damping factor of λ 1 3 95 by contrast the numerically predicted damping factor is λ 1 4 54 i e a magnification of 1 15 with respect to the theory table 5 summarizes fundamental natural periods and damping factors under different conditions one can observe that both the added mass and the added damping effects become stronger with the growth of submerged depth noticing the natural period is proportional to the square root of mass the added mass almost equals the structure mass when d h 0 1 yet the former becomes nearly 6 times the latter when d h reaches 0 6 which can make a great influence on the dynamic response of structures compared with the added mass effect the added damping effect seems to be less sensitive to the submerged depth and its influence on structure motion is less obvious 4 2 wave load fig 14 shows the solitary wave induced hydrodynamic pressure at the center of the upper surface plate with a wave amplitude of a h 0 4 and submerged depth of d h 0 1 hydrostatic pressure has been excluded from fig 14 and the pressures upon both rigid and elastic plates are given in order to evaluate hydroelastic effects in fig 14 a the pressure history can be divided into 3 stages the flow field snapshot of each stage is shown in fig 15 at the beginning of the first stage which is from 7 87s to 8 14s the solitary wave has just entered the upper surface of the submerged box and begins to split into two waves hereinafter referred to as the first wave and the second wave in this stage the hydrodynamic pressure experiences a sharp rise and the maximum pressure occurs at 8 14s at which time the crest of the first wave reaches the center of the upper surface plate high frequency oscillation happens in this stage due to the overturning and breaking of wave surfaces hydroelastic effect is not the main cause of the high frequency oscillation which explains why it appears in both subplots of fig 14 the second stage begins at 8 14s and ends at 8 53s in the second stage the first wave starts to leave the submerged box and the pressure therefore decreases in the meanwhile the second wave start to the cover the upper surface plate making the pressure decreasing rate get slower and slower the decreasing rate approaches zero at 8 53s which is shown in fig 14 b at this moment the plate is completely covered by the second wave as is shown in fig 15 c another interesting phenomenon is the change of pressure oscillation at beginning of the second stage high frequency oscillation still exists however with the weakening of surface overturning and wave breaking effect high frequency oscillation vanishes after 8 3s in fig 14 b by contrast pressure oscillation exists in a low frequency pattern in fig 14 a where an elastic upper surface plate is adopted this low frequency pressure oscillation is caused by the vibration of the plate which is a typical hydroelastic effect in fact the pressure oscillation changes from high frequency which is dominated by the pressure fluctuation of flow field to low frequency which is caused by the structural vibration during the second stage the third stage starts at 8 53s in this stage the second wave is leaving the plate mostly along the backward direction see fig 15 d the hydrodynamic pressure on the rigid plate declines fast and smoothly the hydrodynamic pressure on the elastic plates oscillates in declining amplitudes which is induced by the added damping effect and the own damping of the structure in fig 16 a fast fourier transform fft is conducted on the pressure histories of fig 14 the fft result with respect to the elastic plate has three peaks the first peak lies at frequency 0 305 hz with a height of 47 9 which is drawn separately in a small figure in fig 16 a the first peak reflects the mean variation of pressure the second and third peak can reflect structure vibration and correspond to frequencies of 30 8 hz and 162 hz respectively by contrast only one peak exists in fig 16 b which is with respect to the mean varying hydrodynamic pressure upon the rigid plate the difference between the first peaks of fig 16 a and fig 16 b in both location and height is less than 0 3 in order to further understand the role of hydroelasticity fig 17 separates the fft results of fig 16 into various parts frequency ranges and converts them back to the pressure history curves in subplot b of fig 17 the pressure oscillation 18 hz on the rigid plate has a short duration the oscillation seems to be irregular and the strength within various frequency ranges does not show noteworthy difference which present features of white noise by contrast as is shown in subplot a of fig 17 the hydroelastic effect enhances the duration and strength of low frequency between 18 hz and 100 hz pressure oscillation whereas the strength of high frequency 200 hz oscillation is weaken fig 18 compares the mean pressure variation curves 18 hz and the original pressure history curves on the rigid and elastic plate most of the time the mean hydrodynamic pressure on the elastic plate is identical to that on the rigid plate yet a small discrepancy can be found from 8 3s to 8 7s during which time the mean pressure on the elastic plate is slightly greater than that on the rigid plate this may be related to the effect of pressure oscillation as has been mentioned above the pressure oscillation on the rigid plate vanishes after 8 3s whereas the oscillation still exists for the elastic plate after 8 7s the pressure oscillation on the elastic plate has been greatly weakened which is the time when the agreement between the mean pressures on the rigid and elastic plate becomes good again 4 3 structural response fig 19 shows the displacement of the upper plate center of the submerged box with a h 0 4 and d h 0 1 subplot a is simulated with an elastic plate in the flow field i e hydroelastic effect considered for ease of assessing the hydroelastic effect subplot b is obtained through first getting the pressure distribution on a rigid plate by means of solving the interaction between a solitary waves and a rigid plate and then calculating the response of the elastic plate under such pressure distribution using this method hydroelasitic effect is thus excluded in subplot b of fig 19 as can be seen the deformation due to hydrostatic pressure is around 1 10 4m despite the mean deforming trend of fig 19 a and fig 19 b show similar outlines palpable difference can be observed in the small amplitude oscillation by comparing detail 1 and 2 in both subplots one can observe the displacement oscillation of fig 19 a seems to have a period longer than that of fig 19 b which is due to the added mass effect in addition the oscillation period of fig 19 a is found to be growing over time through comparing oscillation cycle numbers in detail 1 and detail 2 this phenomenon indicates the added mass effect is changing during the interaction process by contrast since no added mass effect is involved the oscillation period barely changes with time in fig 19 b fig 20 shows the ffts of fig 19 with hydroelastic effect involved in subplot a and excluded in subplot b in subplot b a single peak is found at 56 5 hz namely the fundamental natural frequency of the elastic plate in air in subplot a a double peak is found at 27 6 hz and 30 8 hz respectively one interesting thing is that neither peak frequency equals the fundamental natural frequency 40 8 hz of the elastic plate in still water which means the added mass is affected by the status of flow field for the purpose of investigating the effect of various frequency components fig 21 separates fft results of fig 20 into several parts and converts each part back to the displacement history using the inversed fft method in both subplot a and b of fig 21 the mean displacement variation can be well described by curves whose frequency ranges from 0 to 18 hz with hydroelastic effect taken into account the displacement oscillation mainly lies in a frequency interval of 18 hz 40 hz and the component with frequency greater than 40 hz is little on the contrary without hydroelastic effect the displacement oscillation mainly appears at frequencies larger than 40 hz yet oscillation within a frequency range of 18 hz 40 hz can be seldom found to reveal the meaning of the double peak in fig 20 a frequency ranging from 18 hz to 40 hz is further divided into two segments with the lower segment 18 hz 29 5 hz representing the peak at 27 6 hz and the higher segment 29 5 hz 40 hz the peak at 30 8 hz as is shown in fig 21 a the oscillation of higher segment mainly happens in the initial and final stages of the interaction process yet the oscillation of lower segment primarily lies in the intermediate stage when the upper surface plate of the submerged box is covered by massive volume of water fig 22 compares the original displacement histories and the mean variation curves 18 hz at the upper plate center of the box with and without considering hydroelastic effect most of the time the two mean displacements agree well with each other however the hydroelasitic displacement is slightly larger than the displacement without considering hydroelasicity in the vicinity of moment 8 5s driven by the difference in pressure which is induced by hydroelastic effect and is already shown in fig 18 to further reveal the temporal change of oscillation frequency a wavelet transform is performed it is well known that wavelet transforms preserve the temporal variations when they are used for calculating the spectra of a time series there is a variety of wavelets such as symlet daubechies coiflet biorthogonal meyer haar and so on bayındır 2016 in the present study a gauss type window function is used for the wavelet transform which is written as 17 g f t 0 ω f t 1 4 π α 0 exp t t 0 2 4 α 0 e i ω t ⅆ t where f t is the time series to be processed and denotes complex conjugate parameter α 0 controls the scale of the window the wavelet transformation results are illustrated in fig 23 it should be mentioned that mean displacement variation 18 hz before performing wavelet transform has been excluded from the time series such that the transformation can be focused on oscillation capturing in fig 23 a the oscillation starts at 8s and ends at 9s the oscillatory frequency is low and keeps shifting with time due to a time varying added mass effect in fig 23 b the oscillatory frequency is high and shows no change with time the duration of oscillation is shorter the frequencies 27 6 hz and 30 8 hz of the double peak in fig 20 approximately correspond to the lower and upper bound of the red color part of fig 23 a which represent two different oscillatory statuses as has been mentioned the time varying added mass effect leads to the shifting of oscillatory frequency the question then comes to why added mass changes from section 4 1 we know that the natural period or added mass changes with submerged depth which may be a clue for explanation during the interaction between a solitary wave and a submerged box the water depth upon the upper surface plate keeps changing this is equivalent to changing the submerged depth of the box following this idea we monitor the spatially averaged water depth above the upper surface at different time and switch it into the natural frequency in still water by performing a linear interpolation on table 5 with the averaged depth upon upper surface treated as the submerged depth the resulted natural frequency denoted as the still water prediction is drawn with a magenta dash dot line in fig 23 a it is found that the still water prediction as a whole can well describe the changing trend of oscillation frequency it can explain why oscillations are in high frequency during the initial and final stage of the interaction process while in low frequency during the middle stage the small difference between the still water prediction and wavelet transformation result may be caused by uneven distribution of water depth on the upper surface motion of fluid hydrodynamic effect and the motion of structure which in turn affects the fluid motion hydroelastic effect nevertheless the still water prediction can still give a good approximation if high accuracy is not required and hence may be a good choice for engineering problems one may find that a high frequency 162 hz peak exists in the fft result of hydroelastic pressure i e fig 16 a yet no such peak can be found in the fft result of fig 20 a this is because the amplitude of high frequency oscillation of displacement is too small which is hardly observed in the fft result however high frequency oscillation will be more easily to be reflected in the velocity series fig 24 shows the velocity of the upper plate center of the submerged box with and without considering hydroelastic effect since the oscillation frequency is larger if no hydroelastic effect is contained the velocity vibration is of higher amplitude in subplot b than in subplot a fig 25 gives the fft results with respect to fig 24 in fig 25 a a high frequency peak of exact 162 hz can be found and a double peak analogous to that of fig 20 a also exists like the analysis of displacement one can also perform frequency separation and wavelet transform upon velocity series and similar conclusions can be drawn fig 26 gives deformations of the entire plate at various moments with original deformation in subplot a and mean deformation without components with frequency exceeding 18 hz in subplot b for ease of comparison the results obtained with and without the consideration of hydroelastic effect are placed together with different colors blue for hydroelasticity and red for no hydroelasticity at 7 5s the blue and red lines completely coincide as the solitary wave has not arrived at the plate and the deformation is induced by hydrostatic pressure after solitary wave reaches the vibration of the plate starts as the vibration frequency and amplitude are different a palpable distinction between the blue and red lines can be seen after extracting the oscillatory components from the original deformation shape the agreement between the mean deformation contours in blue and red lines is improved but discrepancies still exists because of hydroelastic effect 4 4 flow field figs 27 and 28 and fig 29 show the vorticity field the dynamic pressure field and the velocity field of the flow during the interaction process with solitary wave amplitude a h 0 4 and submerged depth of the box d h 0 2 the flow fields obtained with both elastic and rigid upper surface plate are placed together for the purpose of evaluating hydroelastic effect in fig 27 one can observe vortices forming at both ends of the submerged box when the solitary wave arrives and shedding after the solitary wave leaves in fig 28 the hydrodynamic pressure of the solitary wave is strong before it enters the submerged box and becomes weak after the solitary wave leaves during the process of interaction the dynamic pressure of the region above the box is stronger than that of the region underneath the box and localized low pressure area can be found where vortices happen in fig 29 the velocity field in vicinity of the wave crest is strong and is mainly along the horizontal direction vertical velocity component happens nearby the wave surface which corresponds to the free surface vorticity in fig 27 in addition rotational velocity field can be observed at the vortices nearby the vertexes of the box one can find in figs 27 figs 28 and 29 that the flow fields obtained with the elastic and rigid upper plate highly resemble each other which means hydroelastic effect barely affects the global feature of the flow field this is due to the fact that the deformation of the elastic plate is small from subsection 4 3 we know the orders of the displacement and velocity of the plate are o 10 4m and o 10 3m s respectively yet the dimension of the plate i e the boundary of the flow is of order o 10 1m and velocity of the flow is of order 10 1m s such a difference in order can be hardly reflected in figs 27 and 28 or fig 29 and can thereby be neglected that is if there is no special requirement on accuracy of the flow field then one can simulate the flow field by using a rigid upper plate instead of an elastic one which greatly simplifies the difficulty of simulation and at the same time saves computational cost however this treatment is no longer appropriate if the structure is large deformed another point needed to be clarified is although hydroelastic effect can be neglected during the solution of fluid field its influence on structural response cannot be ignored for instance if the influence of hydroelastic effect on structures is not considered then the velocity of the plate is of order o 10 2m s see fig 24 b this means the motion of structures should have non negligible impact on the flow field which is of course a wrong judgment 4 5 parametric study fig 30 and fig 31 show the original and mean displacement oscillation picked out at the upper plate center of the submerged box calculated with various wave amplitudes and submerged depth results with and without the consideration of hydroelasticity are contrasted in all the simulated cases the mean displacement curves with hydroelasticity involved well agree with those without hydroelasticity with the ascent of wave amplitudes and the descent of submerged depths displacement oscillation grows and the degree of asymmetry becomes serious which indicates the occurrence of surface overturning and the enhancement of nonlinearity fig 32 shows the variation of minimum dimensionless mean dynamic deformations at the upper plate center with respect to wave amplitude and submerged depth here the dimensionless mean dynamic deformations are defined as a m e d m e d s a and a m r d m r d s a where d m e and d m r are mean deformation with and without considering hydroelastic effect d s is static deformation due to hydrostatic pressure and a is wave amplitude in a linear theory the wave load and structure response is proportionate to the wave amplitude which means the dimensionless deformation should be constant however in fig 32 a dimensionless mean deformations increase with the growth of wave amplitude which is a typical nonlinear effect in fig 32 b when submerged depth increases the absolute value of mean dynamic deformation is first enlarged and then reduced in order to explain this phenomenon one should examine the dynamic pressure field which is shown in fig 33 with a h 0 4 and d h ranging from 0 1 to 0 6 as can be seen when d h 0 1 the blocking effect of the box is significant and the solitary wave seems to be cut into two parts the structure of the solitary wave is almost destroyed leading to small hydrodynamic pressure upon the upper face of the box by comparison the structure of the wave field is more complete when d h 0 2 and therefore the hydrodynamic pressure field is stronger when d h 0 4 the structure of the solitary wave field is well preserved and the surface contour in fig 33 c is not significantly changed as a result large hydrodynamic pressure field can be found which means large structural deformation should be induced however when the value of d h becomes 0 6 the strength of the hydrodynamic pressure declines a little since the box is close to the bottom where the dynamic pressure is ought to be smaller and meanwhile the reflection induced by the submerged box becomes weak fig 34 gives the maximum relative difference between the dimensionless mean dynamic deformation of the elastic plate and that of the rigid plate which is defined mathematically as e m max a m e a m r max a m r this relative difference reflects the influence of hydroelasticity on the mean deformation the plate as a whole the relative difference is little which means the influence of hydroelasticity on mean deformation is not significant however it should be noted that the relative difference becomes larger with the growth of wave amplitude and the decreasing of submerged depth indicating hydroelastic effect is enhanced under such conditions to investigate the strength of oscillation in deformation the maximum dimensionless oscillation amplitude is introduced which is defined as a o e max d o e max d m e and a o r max d o r max d m r where d o e and d o r denote oscillatory deformations extracted from raw deformation series of fig 30 fig 35 displays the variation of a o e and a o r with respect to the wave amplitude and the submerged depth one can find the hydroelastic oscillation is always weaker than the oscillation without considering hydroelasticity their difference becomes smaller with the descending of wave amplitude and the ascending of submerged depth owing to the hydroelastic effect getting weaker under such condition fig 36 shows the frequencies of displacement oscillation predicted by fft as has been mentioned a double peak can be found in the fft results of hydroelastic deformation therefore we give two curves to describe the oscillation frequency of hydroelastic deformation in fig 36 with the growth of wave amplitude and the decline of submerged depth the deviation between the oscillatory frequency of hydroelastic displacement and the natural frequency in still water becomes large which again reflects the enhancement of hydroelastic effect by contrast the oscillatory frequency without considering hydroelasticity barely changes it is found that the still water prediction method proposed in subsection 4 3 can still offer a good approximation on the change of the hydroelastic oscillation frequency during the interaction process for instance fig 37 compares the results of still water prediction against the wavelet transform and a good agreement can be observed 5 conclusions this paper investigates the hydroelastic interaction between a solitary wave and a submerged box with an elastic upper surface plate since the interaction process of a solitary wave meeting a rigid submerged box has been investigated in previous study this work concentrates on the dynamics of structures and the effect of hydroelasticity through performing a series of numerical tests in a nwt the following conclusions are drawn 1 during the interaction process both the flow field and the structure response are composed of two components i e the mean variation and the oscillatory motion based on this fact the hydroelastic interaction process can be summarized as follows when a solitary wave comes the mean hydrodynamic pressure field starts to change which leads to a mean deformation of the plate at certain moments a transient high frequency oscillation on the pressure field is induced due to strong nonlinear effects such as surface overturning and wave breaking the oscillation of the pressure field stimulates the oscillation of the plate which in turn makes the flow field to be oscillatory as time goes on the oscillation of structure and flow field is dissipated due to the added damping effect and the own damping effect of the structure and the mean flow field and structure deformation are left 2 in the present study the influence of hydroelasticity on the mean flow field is little the velocity pressure and vorticity of the flow field highly resemble those simulated with a rigid submerged box in the flow field as to the oscillatory flow field hydroelasticity tends to enhance the low frequency oscillation of pressure field and suppress the high frequency oscillation 3 hydroelasticity affects the oscillatory motion of the structure in the following ways due to a time varying added mass effect the oscillation frequency is changed during the interaction process with high frequency oscillation happening in the initial final stage of interaction and low frequency oscillation in the middle stage the amplitude of the oscillation is weakened and the duration of the oscillation is extended hydroelasticity can change the mean deformation of the plate and a relative difference of less than 4 can be found between mean deformations obtained with and without considering hydroelasticity 4 the mean dynamic deformation per unit wave amplitude decreases with the growth of wave amplitude as submerged depth increases the mean dynamic deformation of the plate rises first and then declines slightly after d h exceeds 0 4 the oscillation of the flow field and the structure is significantly weakened with the growth of wave amplitude and the reduction of submerged depth 5 hydroelastic effect becomes weak with the growth of wave amplitude and the reduction of submerged depth which is reflected by the hydroelastic oscillatory and mean deformation being closer to those obtained without considering hydroelasticity 6 the variation of added mass effect can be well approximated by a still water prediction method see subsection 4 3 which determines the oscillatory frequency according to the mean water depth above the plate credit authorship contribution statement zhe hu conceptualization methodology software formal analysis investigation writing original draft

21901,the nonlinear hydroelastic interaction between a solitary wave and a submerged box with elastic upper surface plate is investigated in a 2d numerical wave flume the objective is to investigate how hydroelasticity affects the interaction process the numerical wave flume solves incompressible navier stokes equations with a volume of fluid method for free surface simulation the linear elastic structure dynamic equations are solved by a finite element method and embedded into the solution of flow field by using a monolithic fluid structure interaction algorithm the numerical method is thoroughly verified against existing experiments and numerical simulations a series of numerical tests are conducted which contains free vibrations of the plate and the interaction between solitary waves and submerged boxes with various wave amplitudes and submerged depths results obtained with and without considering hydroelasticity are compared to investigate the influence of hydroelastic effect on the wave load the structure response and the flow field fast fourier transform and wavelet transform are adopted to reveal the oscillatory features of the interaction process some meaningful conclusions are drawn such as hydroelasticity changes the amplitude and period of the oscillatory motion and the variation of the oscillatory frequency can be approximated by a simple still water prediction method keywords solitary wave submerged box wave structure interaction hydroelastic effect structure response 1 introduction flat plate structure is widely applied in the field of coastal and ocean engineering many complex structures such as bridges floating docks offshore airports submerged breakwaters sea ice etc are composed of flat plate structures due to strong nonlinearity and complex wave overtopping and slamming effects usually it is expensive and time consuming to study the interaction between waves and complex structures however if the complex structures such as submerged breakwaters can be idealized as flat plates without inducing much error the problem will be greatly simplified since both experiments and numerical simulations can be performed with much lower cost solitary waves being explained by the shallow water korteweg de vries kdv equations are inherently nonlinear waves and the analytical solution of the interaction between solitary waves and plates is difficult to find therefore existing research on these problems mainly relies on experiments and numerical solutions the preliminary experiment on solitary wave plate interaction was conducted by kulin 1958 in which wave forces upon a submerged plate were measured without considering green water effects french 1970 studied solitary wave loads on elevated horizontal platforms by experiment recently lau et al 2011 performed a set of experiments to measure solitary wave forces acting on a coastal bridge model lo and liu 2013 investigated the wave scattering of a solitary wave travelling over a submerged horizontal plate by experiments in a wave flume seiffert et al 2014 studied the horizontal and vertical forces acting on a two dimensional horizontal plate due to solitary waves by conducting a series of laboratory experiments and investigated the influence of wave amplitudes water depth and submergence depth of the plate zaghian et al 2017 investigated the interaction

fluid field and is more convenient to be conducted utilizing the mixed eulerian lagrangian method for the free surface flow and the finite element method fem for the deflection of an elastic plate he and kashiwagi 2012 numerically simulated the hydroelastic behavior of a vertical plate due to solitary waves seiffert et al 2014 investigated solitary wave loads upon a horizontal plate through numerical simulations which adopted the interfoam solver in the openfoam cfd package to solve euler s equations using the same numerical technique hayatdavoodi et al 2014 studied the interaction between solitary waves and a deck with girders and examined the role of girders on the forces by making comparison against loads induced by flat plates hayatdavoodi et al 2017 simulated the transformation of solitarys and cnoidal waves over a submerged fixed horizontal rigid plate by use of the nonlinear shallow water level i green naghdi gn equations and investigated the nonlinear wave scattering effects under a variety of circumstances using the moving particle semi implicit method for fluid solution and fem for structure solution rao and wan 2018 simulated the process of solitary wave impacting onto a horizontal elastic plate which was placed certain distance above the still water surface level chang et al 2018 simulated the interaction between a solitary wave and a thin submerged inclined plate by numerical simulation in which the flow field wave profiles and induced forces were computed by applying a streamfunction vorticity formulations with free surface svfs model you et al 2019 investigated the nonlinear interaction between solitary waves and a submerged flat plate in a multi phase numerical viscous wave flume which was constructed based on a constrained interpolation profile cip scheme for solving navier stokes equations and a tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc scheme for free surface processing the present study numerically simulates the nonlinear interaction between solitary waves and a submerged box with an elastic upper surface as the interaction between solitary waves and rigid bodies has been investigated a lot the present study focuses on the dynamic response of structures and the hydroelastic effect the aim is to reveal how hydroelasticity affects the behavior of structures and the entire interaction process and to help understand the hydroelastic vibration of structures subject to nonlinear waves to achieve this goal two groups of simulations are conducted in a numerical wave tank nwt with a solver for fluid structure interaction fsi issues the first group simulates the fsi process when a solitary wave encounters a submerged box whose upper surface is an elastic flat plate by contrast in the second group the fluid load is firstly obtained by simulating the issue under the rigid body assumption and then imposed upon the elastic plate for the calculation of structure response the two groups of simulations are compared comprehensively in order to investigate the influence of hydroelastic effect the content of the paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a concise introduction on the numerical methods used in the study which contains fundamentals of the fluid solver and the fsi method and the setup of the nwt including wave generation and absorption method section 3 validates the numerical methods by generating solitary waves and simulating the issue of solitary waves meeting rigid submerged boxes the simulation results are compared against the solitary wave theory experimental results and existing numerical simulations the main simulation results of the present study are presented and analyzed in section 4 which is separated into 5 subsections subsection 4 1 performs free dissipation tests of structures in still water and obtains some natural vibration features of the simulated problems subsection 4 2 4 3 and 4 4 discuss characters of the wave load the structure response and the flow field during the interaction process the influence of parameters involving wave amplitudes and submerged depths is discussed in subsection 4 5 the conclusions of the study are reported in section 5 2 numerical method 2 1 fluid solver the nwt solves 2d navier stokes equations of incompressible newtonian fluid and adopts a vof youngs method youngs 1982 for free surface reconstruction the governing equations are 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i g i υ x j u i x j u j x i 3 f t u i f x i 0 eqs 1 3 are the continuity equation the momentum equation and the fluid volume transportation equation respectively subscript i and j are index tensor notations and the summation convention is adopted u i is the velocity vector component p is pressure g i is the gravitational acceleration vector component υ is the coefficient of kinematic viscosity and f is the fluid volume function which is used in the vof method five sorts of boundary conditions are used in the nwt i e the non slide solid wall condition free surface condition wave generation condition open boundary condition and the fluid structure interface condition the non slide wall condition forces the velocity to be zero at the boundary the free surface boundary indicates that no shear stress exists upon the free water surface shear stress from air is not considered in the simulation and the normal stress is a constant in 2 dimensional space this condition can be expressed as 4 u n τ u τ n 0 5 p 2 μ u n n p 0 where subscript n and τ denote velocity components along the tangent and normal direction of the free surfaces respectively p 0 is the constant pressure upon free surface and μ is the coefficient of dynamic viscosity there are basically two kinds of wave generation methods in nwts the first kind of method generates waves by setting the boundary condition of the computing domain it can be a moving solid wall boundary imitating the pushing paddle or rotating paddle of the physical wave tank troch and rouck 1999 ren et al 2008 lara et al 2011 or simply a fixed inlet boundary with velocity and pressure of the boundary determined relying on the target wave hu et al 2017 another wave generation method is by introducing source terms into the momentum equations or the continuity equation for instance lin and liu 1999 developed an internal wave maker method with a mass source function choi and yoon 2009 utilized a momentum source function to generate waves in a 2 d and 3 d wave basin the present study uses the first method by setting a fixed wave inlet boundary at the left end of the wave flume the advantage of this method is low computation cost and easy implementation the velocity and pressure of the inlet boundary are directly given by the analytical solution of solitary waves at the right end of the nwt an open boundary is installed to let waves pass through freely without causing reflection the open boundary condition can be formulated as 6 r t c r x 0 where r represents any wave related quantity such as surface elevation velocity and pressure c is the wave travelling velocity phase velocity which should be calculated properly in order to reach a good wave passing effect in this paper c is also given by the analytical solution of solitary waves compared with the sponge layer absorber which is another popular wave absorption method the open boundary requires no additional absorption region thus reducing the computational consumption hu et al 2015 the fluid structure interface condition will be discussed later since it is related to the fsi algorithm the pressure gradient term and diffusion term of eq 2 are discretized with the central difference scheme cds and the convention term with a mixed central and upwind difference scheme uds time derivative is discretized with a forward euler scheme with first order accuracy the coupled velocity pressure equation is solved with a simple two step projection method which first calculates a temporary velocity field and then correcting it by determining a pressure field such that the mass conservation equation is satisfied if the velocity field u i n at moment n δ t is given with δ t denoting time step length the temporary velocity field u i and the corrected velocity field u i n 1 at moment n 1 δ t are further given by 7 u i u i n δ t u j n u i n x j g i n υ x j u i n x j u j n x i 8 u i n 1 u i δ t 1 ρ p n 1 x i the pressure field at moment n 1 δ t is determined by substituting eq 8 into eq 1 yielding a poisson equation as follows 9 x i 1 ρ p n 1 x i 1 δ t u i x i eq 9 is solved by using a successive over relaxation sor iteration method 2 2 fsi method a monolithic implicit fsi method based on simple algorithm is utilized to account for the hydroelastic interaction between solitary waves and elastic plates detailed description of the method including theoretical formulation numerical implementation convergence study and validation can be found in hu et al 2016 here we present the basic idea and the foundational equations of the fsi method without going into details the fem is used for structure solution in a 2 dimensional nwt plates can be simplified as beams and are further divided into euler bernoulli beam elements which contain two degrees of freedom translational and rotational displacement at each node by introducing a lumped mass matrix and proportional damping matrix the dynamic structural equation in a fem form can be written as 10 m w c w k w f where w is the nodal deformation vector w and w represent the vector of nodal velocity and nodal acceleration respectively m c and k are the global matrix of mass damping and stiffness and f stands for the nodal force vector which is fluid load in the present study the houbolt scheme an unconditionally stable implicit multi step scheme with 4 order accuracy is employed for temporal discretization the discretized equation is formulated as 11 2 a 1 m 11 a 2 c k w t δ t f t δ t 5 a 1 m 18 a 2 c w t 4 a 1 m 9 a 2 c w t δ t a 1 m 2 a 2 c w t 2 δ t where a 1 1 δ t 2 and a 2 1 6 δ t the fluid structure interface condition can be described as the continuity of force and velocity which is written as 12 v f s s t 13 σ f n t s where v f and σ f are the fluid velocity and stress tensor at the fluid structure interface s s and t s are the structure deformation and distributed load at the fluid structure interface n is the interface normal since the viscous force is much smaller than the normal force you et al 2019 the left side of eq 13 can be simplified as p i where i is unit tensor by performing certain interpolation between fluid grid points and structure nodes above relationships can be rewritten as 14 u q 1 w 15 q 2 p f f where u and p are velocity and pressure of grid points at fluid structure interface f f is fluid induced nodal force on fem nodes q 1 and q 2 are interpolation matrix after the fluid structure interface equations eq 14 and eq 15 are established the structure solution is first embedded into the sor iteration of fluid in which the relationship between u and p is constructed then by considering the additional damping effect of fluid at each iterative step the structural dynamic equation is modified as 16 m w c c f w k w f r where c f is the additional damping matrix induced by the flow field finally the modified structural equation is solved using the houbolt scheme together with the sor iteration of fluid pressure poisson equation solving fluid and structure simultaneously rather than one after another the fsi method exhibits fast convergence rate and is suitable for solving transient impact problems 2 3 nwt setup the schematic diagram of the nwt is shown in fig 1 following the experiment conducted by seiffert et al 2014 and numerical simulation by you et al 2019 the tank length is 15 m the tank height is 0 15 m and the water depth is h 0 086 m a hollow watertight box structure which can be widely found in coastal and ocean engineering is submerged in the center zone of the nwt the thickness of the box is t 0 013 m and the distance between the wave inlet boundary and the leading edge of the box is l1 8 m 4 normalized incoming wave heights a h 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 and 4 normalized submergence depths d h 0 1 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 of the upper face of the box are selected two wave gauges are placed in the nwt with wg1 0 610 m upstream of the leading edge of the box and wg2 0 610 m downstream of the rear edge of the box the upper surface plate of the submerged box which is greatly affected by the solitary wave is assumed to be rigid or elastic the physical parameters of the elastic plate are chosen such that only small deformation is induced during the interaction process and therefore a linear fem can be used for structure simulation table 1 lists main parameters of the fluid and the plate it should be noted that only the typical parameter combinations are simulated in this study as the fsi simulation of all the parameter combinations is time consuming 3 validation in order to verify the numerical method a series of numerical tests are conducted including generation of solitary waves and simulation of solitary waves travelling through rigid submerged boxes the simulation results are compared against theoretical solution experimental results and other numerical results 3 1 convergence test this subsection gives a short test on the influence of simulation controlling parameters such as the mesh size and the time step length in the test the wave height of the solitary wave is a 0 3h and the submerged depth of the box is d 0 2h three groups of parameter combinations are tested the uniform mesh is used the cpu of the machine is intel xeon e5 2650 2 20 ghz with 128 gb available ram details of the parameter combinations as well as the time consumption are listed in table 2 fig 2 shows the surface records at wg1 simulated using various parameter combinations with and without the existence of the submerged box fig 3 compares the wave force upon the submerged box and fig 4 depicts displacement of the center point of the supper surface plate in figs 2 4 the simulation results of all the parameter combinations show good agreement with each other although little difference can be observed at the curve peaks or troughs this means the time step length and the grid size are small enough to reach a convergent solution therefore we use parameter combination 1 throughout the rest of the paper due to its smaller time consumption 3 2 solitary wave generation four solitary waves which will be used later are first generated in the nwt fig 5 compares surface histories obtained by numerical simulation and the solitary wave theory which can be found in many works say seiffert et al 2014 the numerical and theoretical results show very good agreement indicating that the simulated solitary waves can be further used for simulating wave structure interaction fig 6 depicts solitary wave surface measured at different wave gauges the wave contour remains stable while travelling which is another evidence of solitary waves being properly generated in fig 6 after solitary wave leaves only small fluctuation of free surface can be observed this indicates that the open boundary is efficient and the solitary waves pass through the open boundary with no reflection 3 3 interaction between solitary wave and rigid submerged box following the experiment of seiffert et al 2014 and the numerical simulation of you et al 2019 we perform several groups of numerical tests fig 7 compares the simulated non dimensional surface elevations against the experimental results of seiffert et al 2014 and the numerical results of you et al 2019 with submerged depth d h 0 2 and wave amplitude a h changing from 0 1 to 0 4 fig 8 selects 6 snapshots of wave profiles covering the main process of the solitary wave structure interaction with submerged depth d h 0 2 and wave amplitude a h 0 3 the snapshots are also compared with those given by you et al 2019 fig 9 contrasts the simulated global wave force upon the submerged box with the numerical results of you et al 2019 from figs 7 9 it is found that all the simulation results present good agreement with experiments and other numerical results this means our numerical method can correctly simulate the interaction between solitary waves and submerged box some interesting phenomena happen when solitary waves meet a submerged box since you et al 2019 has already given a thorough investigation in the interaction between solitary waves and a submerged box here we only give a brief review on the interaction process without going into details this is helpful for the understanding of hydroelastic interaction process which is the main focus of this work when a solitary wave reaches the leading edge of the submerged box a reflection wave is first formed due to the blocking effect of the left edge of the box the solitary wave then splits into two waves i e the back wave left and the front wave right which can be clearly observed in subplot b and c of fig 8 the back wave gets reflected while the front wave continues travelling forward in the meanwhile the front wave changes from a symmetry soliton into an asymmetry wave with a very steep front and a relatively flat back this process is coupled with strong nonlinear effects such as surface overturning wave breaking and the formation of vortices fig 10 gives the evolution of vorticity at various moments calculated with a h 0 4 and d h 0 2 which also exhibits good agreement with you s simulation results two kinds of vorticity exist in the flow field which correspond to the overturning of free surface and the rotational vortex around the vertexes of box a couple of small periodical waves are generated after the front wave passes in fig 7 these waves correspond to the small fluctuation behind the main peaks of surface history curves measured at wg2 3 4 structure solution test this subsection conducts numerical simulation on a classical water entry issue the purpose is to gives a simple test and verification on the structure solution and fsi algorithm of the numerical method the test is short due to the space limitation of the article and detailed investigations on the features of the numerical method can be found in hu et al 2016 the issue is the water entry of an elastic flat plate which is a common phenomenon in ship industry and ocean engineering faltinsen et al 1997 and kvålsvold and faltinsen 1995 studied the water impact on an elastic horizontal plate and gave a series of experimental measurements as well as numerical the theoretical results here we do similar numerical simulations and make comparison with existing results the computational domain is 2 m 2 m with 6400 grids the water depth is 1 5 m with a horizontal plate hitting on the free surface as is shown in fig 11 since the length of the plate is far longer than its width in the experiment the plate could be simplified as a lath beam in 2 d space to capture the transient response of the plate the time interval is 0 00001s and the total simulation time is 0 025s the plate with a length of 0 5 m is divided into 20 euler elements and enters water with the velocity corresponding to a dropping height of 0 5 m the basic parameters are selected according to the experiment of faltinsen et al 1997 and are listed in table 3 fig 12 illustrates the deflection of the plate center in our simulation with comparisons against the theoretical results of faltinsen et al 1997 and the numerical results of kvålsvold and faltinsen 1995 as is shown in fig 12 the present simulation results agree well with the numerical results of kvålsvold and faltinsen 1995 the agreement with the theoretical results is also good in general despite the maximum deflection of our simulation is smaller than the theoretical prediction in fig 12 b the present simulation is found to be closer to the experiment measurement which is listed in table 4 table 4 lists the maximum deflections and velocities obtained using different methods with their deviation against the experimental records of faltinsen et al 1997 it is found that our simulation and the numerical simulation of kvålsvold and faltinsen 1995 show similar precision both presenting good agreement with the experiment yet the theory shows relatively large deviation against the experiment 4 results and discussion 4 1 free vibration in still water added mass and damping effect will be induced for a moving body rigid or elastic in water fig 13 shows the nodal displacements of the center of the upper surface plate during free vibration in still water and air the initial displacement and velocity are 0 the submerged depth is d h 0 1 for the convenience of comparison the load is hydrostatic pressure plus added mass damping induced load in the water and hydrostatic pressure alone in the air it is obvious that the natural vibration period of the plate in still water becomes longer than that in air due to the added mass effect the dry and wet natural periods are 0 0175s and 0 0245s respectively namely a magnification of 1 40 water also changes the damping rate of the vibration in the present fsi method a rational damping matrix is used with the definition c α m β k where α 0 00003 and β 0 00012 corresponding to a damping ratio of 0 021 the rational damping matrix leads to an exponentially decaying pattern of the vibratory amplitude following the free vibration theory the decaying function of mode j is e λ j t where damping factor λ j α β ω j 2 2 and ω j is the j th natural angular frequency for free vibration in air the theory leads to a damping factor of λ 1 7 71 the damping factor can also be numerically predicted by analyzing the amplitude damping curves of fig 13 for free vibration in air the amplitude damping curve leads to λ 1 7 72 which highly agrees with the theory for free vibration in water since the natural frequency is changed the theory gives a damping factor of λ 1 3 95 by contrast the numerically predicted damping factor is λ 1 4 54 i e a magnification of 1 15 with respect to the theory table 5 summarizes fundamental natural periods and damping factors under different conditions one can observe that both the added mass and the added damping effects become stronger with the growth of submerged depth noticing the natural period is proportional to the square root of mass the added mass almost equals the structure mass when d h 0 1 yet the former becomes nearly 6 times the latter when d h reaches 0 6 which can make a great influence on the dynamic response of structures compared with the added mass effect the added damping effect seems to be less sensitive to the submerged depth and its influence on structure motion is less obvious 4 2 wave load fig 14 shows the solitary wave induced hydrodynamic pressure at the center of the upper surface plate with a wave amplitude of a h 0 4 and submerged depth of d h 0 1 hydrostatic pressure has been excluded from fig 14 and the pressures upon both rigid and elastic plates are given in order to evaluate hydroelastic effects in fig 14 a the pressure history can be divided into 3 stages the flow field snapshot of each stage is shown in fig 15 at the beginning of the first stage which is from 7 87s to 8 14s the solitary wave has just entered the upper surface of the submerged box and begins to split into two waves hereinafter referred to as the first wave and the second wave in this stage the hydrodynamic pressure experiences a sharp rise and the maximum pressure occurs at 8 14s at which time the crest of the first wave reaches the center of the upper surface plate high frequency oscillation happens in this stage due to the overturning and breaking of wave surfaces hydroelastic effect is not the main cause of the high frequency oscillation which explains why it appears in both subplots of fig 14 the second stage begins at 8 14s and ends at 8 53s in the second stage the first wave starts to leave the submerged box and the pressure therefore decreases in the meanwhile the second wave start to the cover the upper surface plate making the pressure decreasing rate get slower and slower the decreasing rate approaches zero at 8 53s which is shown in fig 14 b at this moment the plate is completely covered by the second wave as is shown in fig 15 c another interesting phenomenon is the change of pressure oscillation at beginning of the second stage high frequency oscillation still exists however with the weakening of surface overturning and wave breaking effect high frequency oscillation vanishes after 8 3s in fig 14 b by contrast pressure oscillation exists in a low frequency pattern in fig 14 a where an elastic upper surface plate is adopted this low frequency pressure oscillation is caused by the vibration of the plate which is a typical hydroelastic effect in fact the pressure oscillation changes from high frequency which is dominated by the pressure fluctuation of flow field to low frequency which is caused by the structural vibration during the second stage the third stage starts at 8 53s in this stage the second wave is leaving the plate mostly along the backward direction see fig 15 d the hydrodynamic pressure on the rigid plate declines fast and smoothly the hydrodynamic pressure on the elastic plates oscillates in declining amplitudes which is induced by the added damping effect and the own damping of the structure in fig 16 a fast fourier transform fft is conducted on the pressure histories of fig 14 the fft result with respect to the elastic plate has three peaks the first peak lies at frequency 0 305 hz with a height of 47 9 which is drawn separately in a small figure in fig 16 a the first peak reflects the mean variation of pressure the second and third peak can reflect structure vibration and correspond to frequencies of 30 8 hz and 162 hz respectively by contrast only one peak exists in fig 16 b which is with respect to the mean varying hydrodynamic pressure upon the rigid plate the difference between the first peaks of fig 16 a and fig 16 b in both location and height is less than 0 3 in order to further understand the role of hydroelasticity fig 17 separates the fft results of fig 16 into various parts frequency ranges and converts them back to the pressure history curves in subplot b of fig 17 the pressure oscillation 18 hz on the rigid plate has a short duration the oscillation seems to be irregular and the strength within various frequency ranges does not show noteworthy difference which present features of white noise by contrast as is shown in subplot a of fig 17 the hydroelastic effect enhances the duration and strength of low frequency between 18 hz and 100 hz pressure oscillation whereas the strength of high frequency 200 hz oscillation is weaken fig 18 compares the mean pressure variation curves 18 hz and the original pressure history curves on the rigid and elastic plate most of the time the mean hydrodynamic pressure on the elastic plate is identical to that on the rigid plate yet a small discrepancy can be found from 8 3s to 8 7s during which time the mean pressure on the elastic plate is slightly greater than that on the rigid plate this may be related to the effect of pressure oscillation as has been mentioned above the pressure oscillation on the rigid plate vanishes after 8 3s whereas the oscillation still exists for the elastic plate after 8 7s the pressure oscillation on the elastic plate has been greatly weakened which is the time when the agreement between the mean pressures on the rigid and elastic plate becomes good again 4 3 structural response fig 19 shows the displacement of the upper plate center of the submerged box with a h 0 4 and d h 0 1 subplot a is simulated with an elastic plate in the flow field i e hydroelastic effect considered for ease of assessing the hydroelastic effect subplot b is obtained through first getting the pressure distribution on a rigid plate by means of solving the interaction between a solitary waves and a rigid plate and then calculating the response of the elastic plate under such pressure distribution using this method hydroelasitic effect is thus excluded in subplot b of fig 19 as can be seen the deformation due to hydrostatic pressure is around 1 10 4m despite the mean deforming trend of fig 19 a and fig 19 b show similar outlines palpable difference can be observed in the small amplitude oscillation by comparing detail 1 and 2 in both subplots one can observe the displacement oscillation of fig 19 a seems to have a period longer than that of fig 19 b which is due to the added mass effect in addition the oscillation period of fig 19 a is found to be growing over time through comparing oscillation cycle numbers in detail 1 and detail 2 this phenomenon indicates the added mass effect is changing during the interaction process by contrast since no added mass effect is involved the oscillation period barely changes with time in fig 19 b fig 20 shows the ffts of fig 19 with hydroelastic effect involved in subplot a and excluded in subplot b in subplot b a single peak is found at 56 5 hz namely the fundamental natural frequency of the elastic plate in air in subplot a a double peak is found at 27 6 hz and 30 8 hz respectively one interesting thing is that neither peak frequency equals the fundamental natural frequency 40 8 hz of the elastic plate in still water which means the added mass is affected by the status of flow field for the purpose of investigating the effect of various frequency components fig 21 separates fft results of fig 20 into several parts and converts each part back to the displacement history using the inversed fft method in both subplot a and b of fig 21 the mean displacement variation can be well described by curves whose frequency ranges from 0 to 18 hz with hydroelastic effect taken into account the displacement oscillation mainly lies in a frequency interval of 18 hz 40 hz and the component with frequency greater than 40 hz is little on the contrary without hydroelastic effect the displacement oscillation mainly appears at frequencies larger than 40 hz yet oscillation within a frequency range of 18 hz 40 hz can be seldom found to reveal the meaning of the double peak in fig 20 a frequency ranging from 18 hz to 40 hz is further divided into two segments with the lower segment 18 hz 29 5 hz representing the peak at 27 6 hz and the higher segment 29 5 hz 40 hz the peak at 30 8 hz as is shown in fig 21 a the oscillation of higher segment mainly happens in the initial and final stages of the interaction process yet the oscillation of lower segment primarily lies in the intermediate stage when the upper surface plate of the submerged box is covered by massive volume of water fig 22 compares the original displacement histories and the mean variation curves 18 hz at the upper plate center of the box with and without considering hydroelastic effect most of the time the two mean displacements agree well with each other however the hydroelasitic displacement is slightly larger than the displacement without considering hydroelasicity in the vicinity of moment 8 5s driven by the difference in pressure which is induced by hydroelastic effect and is already shown in fig 18 to further reveal the temporal change of oscillation frequency a wavelet transform is performed it is well known that wavelet transforms preserve the temporal variations when they are used for calculating the spectra of a time series there is a variety of wavelets such as symlet daubechies coiflet biorthogonal meyer haar and so on bayındır 2016 in the present study a gauss type window function is used for the wavelet transform which is written as 17 g f t 0 ω f t 1 4 π α 0 exp t t 0 2 4 α 0 e i ω t ⅆ t where f t is the time series to be processed and denotes complex conjugate parameter α 0 controls the scale of the window the wavelet transformation results are illustrated in fig 23 it should be mentioned that mean displacement variation 18 hz before performing wavelet transform has been excluded from the time series such that the transformation can be focused on oscillation capturing in fig 23 a the oscillation starts at 8s and ends at 9s the oscillatory frequency is low and keeps shifting with time due to a time varying added mass effect in fig 23 b the oscillatory frequency is high and shows no change with time the duration of oscillation is shorter the frequencies 27 6 hz and 30 8 hz of the double peak in fig 20 approximately correspond to the lower and upper bound of the red color part of fig 23 a which represent two different oscillatory statuses as has been mentioned the time varying added mass effect leads to the shifting of oscillatory frequency the question then comes to why added mass changes from section 4 1 we know that the natural period or added mass changes with submerged depth which may be a clue for explanation during the interaction between a solitary wave and a submerged box the water depth upon the upper surface plate keeps changing this is equivalent to changing the submerged depth of the box following this idea we monitor the spatially averaged water depth above the upper surface at different time and switch it into the natural frequency in still water by performing a linear interpolation on table 5 with the averaged depth upon upper surface treated as the submerged depth the resulted natural frequency denoted as the still water prediction is drawn with a magenta dash dot line in fig 23 a it is found that the still water prediction as a whole can well describe the changing trend of oscillation frequency it can explain why oscillations are in high frequency during the initial and final stage of the interaction process while in low frequency during the middle stage the small difference between the still water prediction and wavelet transformation result may be caused by uneven distribution of water depth on the upper surface motion of fluid hydrodynamic effect and the motion of structure which in turn affects the fluid motion hydroelastic effect nevertheless the still water prediction can still give a good approximation if high accuracy is not required and hence may be a good choice for engineering problems one may find that a high frequency 162 hz peak exists in the fft result of hydroelastic pressure i e fig 16 a yet no such peak can be found in the fft result of fig 20 a this is because the amplitude of high frequency oscillation of displacement is too small which is hardly observed in the fft result however high frequency oscillation will be more easily to be reflected in the velocity series fig 24 shows the velocity of the upper plate center of the submerged box with and without considering hydroelastic effect since the oscillation frequency is larger if no hydroelastic effect is contained the velocity vibration is of higher amplitude in subplot b than in subplot a fig 25 gives the fft results with respect to fig 24 in fig 25 a a high frequency peak of exact 162 hz can be found and a double peak analogous to that of fig 20 a also exists like the analysis of displacement one can also perform frequency separation and wavelet transform upon velocity series and similar conclusions can be drawn fig 26 gives deformations of the entire plate at various moments with original deformation in subplot a and mean deformation without components with frequency exceeding 18 hz in subplot b for ease of comparison the results obtained with and without the consideration of hydroelastic effect are placed together with different colors blue for hydroelasticity and red for no hydroelasticity at 7 5s the blue and red lines completely coincide as the solitary wave has not arrived at the plate and the deformation is induced by hydrostatic pressure after solitary wave reaches the vibration of the plate starts as the vibration frequency and amplitude are different a palpable distinction between the blue and red lines can be seen after extracting the oscillatory components from the original deformation shape the agreement between the mean deformation contours in blue and red lines is improved but discrepancies still exists because of hydroelastic effect 4 4 flow field figs 27 and 28 and fig 29 show the vorticity field the dynamic pressure field and the velocity field of the flow during the interaction process with solitary wave amplitude a h 0 4 and submerged depth of the box d h 0 2 the flow fields obtained with both elastic and rigid upper surface plate are placed together for the purpose of evaluating hydroelastic effect in fig 27 one can observe vortices forming at both ends of the submerged box when the solitary wave arrives and shedding after the solitary wave leaves in fig 28 the hydrodynamic pressure of the solitary wave is strong before it enters the submerged box and becomes weak after the solitary wave leaves during the process of interaction the dynamic pressure of the region above the box is stronger than that of the region underneath the box and localized low pressure area can be found where vortices happen in fig 29 the velocity field in vicinity of the wave crest is strong and is mainly along the horizontal direction vertical velocity component happens nearby the wave surface which corresponds to the free surface vorticity in fig 27 in addition rotational velocity field can be observed at the vortices nearby the vertexes of the box one can find in figs 27 figs 28 and 29 that the flow fields obtained with the elastic and rigid upper plate highly resemble each other which means hydroelastic effect barely affects the global feature of the flow field this is due to the fact that the deformation of the elastic plate is small from subsection 4 3 we know the orders of the displacement and velocity of the plate are o 10 4m and o 10 3m s respectively yet the dimension of the plate i e the boundary of the flow is of order o 10 1m and velocity of the flow is of order 10 1m s such a difference in order can be hardly reflected in figs 27 and 28 or fig 29 and can thereby be neglected that is if there is no special requirement on accuracy of the flow field then one can simulate the flow field by using a rigid upper plate instead of an elastic one which greatly simplifies the difficulty of simulation and at the same time saves computational cost however this treatment is no longer appropriate if the structure is large deformed another point needed to be clarified is although hydroelastic effect can be neglected during the solution of fluid field its influence on structural response cannot be ignored for instance if the influence of hydroelastic effect on structures is not considered then the velocity of the plate is of order o 10 2m s see fig 24 b this means the motion of structures should have non negligible impact on the flow field which is of course a wrong judgment 4 5 parametric study fig 30 and fig 31 show the original and mean displacement oscillation picked out at the upper plate center of the submerged box calculated with various wave amplitudes and submerged depth results with and without the consideration of hydroelasticity are contrasted in all the simulated cases the mean displacement curves with hydroelasticity involved well agree with those without hydroelasticity with the ascent of wave amplitudes and the descent of submerged depths displacement oscillation grows and the degree of asymmetry becomes serious which indicates the occurrence of surface overturning and the enhancement of nonlinearity fig 32 shows the variation of minimum dimensionless mean dynamic deformations at the upper plate center with respect to wave amplitude and submerged depth here the dimensionless mean dynamic deformations are defined as a m e d m e d s a and a m r d m r d s a where d m e and d m r are mean deformation with and without considering hydroelastic effect d s is static deformation due to hydrostatic pressure and a is wave amplitude in a linear theory the wave load and structure response is proportionate to the wave amplitude which means the dimensionless deformation should be constant however in fig 32 a dimensionless mean deformations increase with the growth of wave amplitude which is a typical nonlinear effect in fig 32 b when submerged depth increases the absolute value of mean dynamic deformation is first enlarged and then reduced in order to explain this phenomenon one should examine the dynamic pressure field which is shown in fig 33 with a h 0 4 and d h ranging from 0 1 to 0 6 as can be seen when d h 0 1 the blocking effect of the box is significant and the solitary wave seems to be cut into two parts the structure of the solitary wave is almost destroyed leading to small hydrodynamic pressure upon the upper face of the box by comparison the structure of the wave field is more complete when d h 0 2 and therefore the hydrodynamic pressure field is stronger when d h 0 4 the structure of the solitary wave field is well preserved and the surface contour in fig 33 c is not significantly changed as a result large hydrodynamic pressure field can be found which means large structural deformation should be induced however when the value of d h becomes 0 6 the strength of the hydrodynamic pressure declines a little since the box is close to the bottom where the dynamic pressure is ought to be smaller and meanwhile the reflection induced by the submerged box becomes weak fig 34 gives the maximum relative difference between the dimensionless mean dynamic deformation of the elastic plate and that of the rigid plate which is defined mathematically as e m max a m e a m r max a m r this relative difference reflects the influence of hydroelasticity on the mean deformation the plate as a whole the relative difference is little which means the influence of hydroelasticity on mean deformation is not significant however it should be noted that the relative difference becomes larger with the growth of wave amplitude and the decreasing of submerged depth indicating hydroelastic effect is enhanced under such conditions to investigate the strength of oscillation in deformation the maximum dimensionless oscillation amplitude is introduced which is defined as a o e max d o e max d m e and a o r max d o r max d m r where d o e and d o r denote oscillatory deformations extracted from raw deformation series of fig 30 fig 35 displays the variation of a o e and a o r with respect to the wave amplitude and the submerged depth one can find the hydroelastic oscillation is always weaker than the oscillation without considering hydroelasticity their difference becomes smaller with the descending of wave amplitude and the ascending of submerged depth owing to the hydroelastic effect getting weaker under such condition fig 36 shows the frequencies of displacement oscillation predicted by fft as has been mentioned a double peak can be found in the fft results of hydroelastic deformation therefore we give two curves to describe the oscillation frequency of hydroelastic deformation in fig 36 with the growth of wave amplitude and the decline of submerged depth the deviation between the oscillatory frequency of hydroelastic displacement and the natural frequency in still water becomes large which again reflects the enhancement of hydroelastic effect by contrast the oscillatory frequency without considering hydroelasticity barely changes it is found that the still water prediction method proposed in subsection 4 3 can still offer a good approximation on the change of the hydroelastic oscillation frequency during the interaction process for instance fig 37 compares the results of still water prediction against the wavelet transform and a good agreement can be observed 5 conclusions this paper investigates the hydroelastic interaction between a solitary wave and a submerged box with an elastic upper surface plate since the interaction process of a solitary wave meeting a rigid submerged box has been investigated in previous study this work concentrates on the dynamics of structures and the effect of hydroelasticity through performing a series of numerical tests in a nwt the following conclusions are drawn 1 during the interaction process both the flow field and the structure response are composed of two components i e the mean variation and the oscillatory motion based on this fact the hydroelastic interaction process can be summarized as follows when a solitary wave comes the mean hydrodynamic pressure field starts to change which leads to a mean deformation of the plate at certain moments a transient high frequency oscillation on the pressure field is induced due to strong nonlinear effects such as surface overturning and wave breaking the oscillation of the pressure field stimulates the oscillation of the plate which in turn makes the flow field to be oscillatory as time goes on the oscillation of structure and flow field is dissipated due to the added damping effect and the own damping effect of the structure and the mean flow field and structure deformation are left 2 in the present study the influence of hydroelasticity on the mean flow field is little the velocity pressure and vorticity of the flow field highly resemble those simulated with a rigid submerged box in the flow field as to the oscillatory flow field hydroelasticity tends to enhance the low frequency oscillation of pressure field and suppress the high frequency oscillation 3 hydroelasticity affects the oscillatory motion of the structure in the following ways due to a time varying added mass effect the oscillation frequency is changed during the interaction process with high frequency oscillation happening in the initial final stage of interaction and low frequency oscillation in the middle stage the amplitude of the oscillation is weakened and the duration of the oscillation is extended hydroelasticity can change the mean deformation of the plate and a relative difference of less than 4 can be found between mean deformations obtained with and without considering hydroelasticity 4 the mean dynamic deformation per unit wave amplitude decreases with the growth of wave amplitude as submerged depth increases the mean dynamic deformation of the plate rises first and then declines slightly after d h exceeds 0 4 the oscillation of the flow field and the structure is significantly weakened with the growth of wave amplitude and the reduction of submerged depth 5 hydroelastic effect becomes weak with the growth of wave amplitude and the reduction of submerged depth which is reflected by the hydroelastic oscillatory and mean deformation being closer to those obtained without considering hydroelasticity 6 the variation of added mass effect can be well approximated by a still water prediction method see subsection 4 3 which determines the oscillatory frequency according to the mean water depth above the plate credit authorship contribution statement zhe hu conceptualization methodology software formal analysis investigation writing original draft

21902,behavior of underwater unexploded ordnance located on the sea bed is poorly understood different types of munitions were tested in the swash and breaker zones of a large scale flume containing medium sand on two initial foreshore slopes 1 16 and 1 10 with regular and irregular wave forcing hs 0 3 1 1 m t p 2 6 9 s migration and burial were measured via pre and post run surveys and internal munition sensors water depths flow velocities wave runup and beach morphology changes were also measured munition sensors consist of an inertial motion unit for roll and heading and optical photocells for burial munition migration distances in the swash zone were greatest for the steeper slope and lower density munitions munition migration mimicked wave runup with net offshore transport breaker zone munitions experienced episodes of onshore and offshore directed motion without preferred direction denser munitions were observed to bury deeper up to 2 munition diameters moderate correlation was observed between burial r 2 0 48 or migration r 2 0 37 with dimensionless parameters such as shields parameter keulegan carpenter number object mobility number munition density and iribarren number attributed to the high variability in munition response even under similar offshore forcing conditions keywords unexploded ordnance swash zone migration burial inertial motion unit 1 introduction the presence of unexploded ordnance uxo or munitions on the seafloor especially in the nearshore is a worldwide concern there are more than 400 formerly used defense sites fuds serdp 2010 in the united states alone where munition launch training disposal and other military activities were conducted leading to the potential for uxo presence in the nearshore environment munitions may be mobilized under wave and current forcing and perhaps transported towards the beach shore posing a risk for the public macdonald et al 2004 motion and burial of objects e g cobbles cylinders conical frusta surrogate munitions has been investigated for different environments including energetic nearshore regions table 1 many of the studies were conducted in small scale wave flumes waves with and without a superimposed current or a simple accelerating flow or flow tunnels under oscillatory flows empirical formulations between burial depth and dimensionless numbers such as the keulegan carpenter number the shields parameter and the object mobility number were identified voropayev et al 2003a cataño lopera et al 2007 2011 demir and garcía 2007 friedrichs et al 2016 rennie et al 2017 initiation of motion was investigated through laboratory experiments identifying the critical object mobility number of underwater cylinders as a function of the ratio between object diameter and bed roughness rennie et al 2017 field studies of surrogate munitions in the surf zone traykovski and austin 2017 and seaward of the surf zone calantoni 2014 have recognized munition density as an important quantity for determining munition mobilization densities lower than saturated sediment density or no mobilization higher densities the majority of the aforementioned studies were conducted in the surf zone or deep water or in oscillatory flow tunnels where the object is continuously submerged there is a lack of knowledge of munition processes in the swash zone the portion of the beach where flows intermittently inundate the beach face the swash zone is highly energetic dynamic and swash processes are different than those occurring in the other regions of the nearshore the motion of cobbles in the swash zone was studied in the laboratory using a dam break mechanism over a solid impermeable sloping bottom luccio 1998 in particular cross shore displacement was measured for different cobble characteristics density size shape and different forcing conditions a theoretical model was implemented and compared with the results obtained from the experiment collection of data in the swash zone over a permeable mobile bed which include the scour burial processes and interaction of the object with the bottom have been accomplished in a more recent laboratory study gross and puleo 2019 however no field or large scale laboratory data on munitions processes in the swash zone to the authors knowledge have been collected ongoing efforts are using probabilistic models to predict munitions migrations distances from their initial location and munition burial exposure status the underwater munitions expert system unmes rennie 2017 provides probabilities on whether a munition remains in place or migrates either near or far from the initial position the distance traveled is estimated as a function of the mobility number of the munition the model relies on recent uxo mobility observations traykovski and austin 2017 rennie et al 2017 other than migration unmes also predicts the degree of burial of munitions via relationships obtained from the scientific and engineering literature unmes is designed for wave dominated climates over non cohesive sands where bottom orbital flows are the main forcing mechanism the model has not yet been validated for munitions status in intermittently submerged nearshore environments thus unmes and other models for predicting munitions burial exposure will benefit from observations of munitions processes in the swash zone the objective of this paper is to investigate how different swash zone hydrodynamic forcing conditions and beach slopes influence the behavior of munitions behavior is described in terms of cross shore migration and burial exposure relative to the local bed level two large scale laboratory studies were conducted yielding simultaneous measurements of hydrodynamics and morphology data and migration and burial of realistic munition surrogates and inert munitions the tested surrogates of different shapes dimensions and densities were designed and fabricated to mimic actual munitions and some have the capability of being instrumented although the studies focused mainly on the behavior of munitions in swash zone observations from munitions deployed in the breaker zone help determine ability for munitions to migrate to the swash zone 2 munitions 2 1 munitions tested during the experiments eight different types of munitions were tested during the experiments 20 mm and 40 mm projectiles 81 mm mortar blu 26 and blu 61 cluster bombs m151 70 hydra rocket and two varieties of m107 155 mm high explosive howitzer projectiles with the same dimensions but different bulk densities fig 1 hereafter each munition type is identified with an id for clarity table 2 the selected munitions were chosen from a larger group of potential munitions in underwater environments based on discussions with a group of munitions mobility researchers calantoni 2014 the strategic environmental research and development program serdp maintains a standardized target repository from which the subset list is contained the eight munitions have different physical characteristics shape bulk density ρ m diameter d and length l table 2 noting that those physical characteristics may play a role in their mobility burial the munitions are small caliber diameter and cover a wide range of bulk densities 2115 7990 kg m3 and dimensions both in length 0 065 0 8 m and diameters 0 02 0 155 m fig 1 and table 2 most of the munitions have an elongated shape referred to as cylindrical with d l ratios of 0 168 0 266 whereas the two cluster bombs are nearly spherical d l 1 except for the raised spin arm flutes the munitions used for the present study are comprised of two categories inerts and surrogates inert is a real munition that is inactive no explosive component inside inerts were provided by the aberdeen test center atc serdp repository in aberdeen maryland usa the other set includes objects designed fabricated to mimic the physical characteristics of real munitions and are referred to as surrogate munitions surrogate munitions were instrumented where possible a detailed description of the surrogate munitions can be found in bruder et al 2018 hereafter the term munition will be used without regard to inert or surrogate except where necessary for clarification 2 2 surrogate munitions design and instrumentation six out of the eight munition types were fabricated 20 mm 40 mm 81 mm blu 61 rkt and 155 mm the other two types blu 26 cluster bomb and a variant of the 155 mm high explosive howitzer projectile 155 mm ld were not replicated but still used in the inert form during the study two of the fabricated munitions 20 mm and 40 mm do not have the internal volume capacity to be instrumented the larger surrogate munitions were designed with the main scope of having realistic objects with the capacity to fit sensors inside their shells the sensors are able to measure one or more of the components of the munition behavior quantification of the physical characteristics e g length diameter center of mass density and axial moment of inertia were made at the serdp repository military manuals federation of american scientists 2017 harms 1978 rogers and celmins 2009 wessam and chen 2015 were also consulted three construction materials were used in combination to achieve similarity with real munitions 20 glass filled delrin 6061 t6 aluminum and 304 304l stainless steel density of 1560 2720 and 7999 kg m3 respectively design in autocad consisted of decomposing the munition into an array of simple geometrical shapes cylinders frusta cones to simplify the actual construction process errors between the physical characteristics of the surrogate and the actual corresponding munition were minimized by assigning different materials to different shapes as well as varying the shell thickness absolute errors of surrogate physical characteristics ranged between 0 and 16 3 note that there are numerous iterations of a given real munition type depending on internal chemical composition fabrication material and shape characteristics calantoni 2017 therefore characteristic variation less than 20 for the particular set of munitions is deemed acceptable for this study 2 2 1 migration tracking sensor x io technologies inertial motion unit imu is a compact self contained low cost sensor equipped with an accelerometer a gyroscope and a magnetometer imu measurement capabilities include triple axis accelerations angular velocity around each of the three axes euler angles roll pitch and yaw quaternion angles and rotation matrix elements cost effectiveness and deployment ease are key features of the imu the sensor is housed inside the surrogate munitions and may be connected to an external battery internal to the munition for extended measurements data are saved to an sd card the imu fits inside each of the surrogates capable of housing sensors however imu data in this paper are shown only from 155 mm 81 mm and rkt the near spherical shape of the blu 61 allows the munition to rotate around all axes complicating the derivation of migration distance the reference system of the imu matches the reference system of the surrogates and is denoted as x m y m z m where x m corresponds to the axis that passes through the longest dimension of the munition with positive x m pointing towards the nose of the object the imu is equipped with an attitude heading and referencing system ahrs algorithm thus the heading of the munition relative to earth may be determined based on yaw angle measurements the intent was to derive the munition migration in the local reference system combining the temporal history of the roll and yaw measurements imu sampling rate during both studies was 256 hz except for the swash zone region during the first experiment where the sampling rate was 512 hz 2 2 2 burial tracking sensor luna optoelectronics to 8 hermetic nsl 4960 photocell ph is an optical sensor that detects the amount of received light and converts it into a voltage signal the 155 mm munitions were designed with an array of 12 photocells surrounding the circumference of the cross section other surrogates did not house ph due to space constraints photocells are wired to 3 6 v aa sized batteries for power and then to microedge data loggers to record data bruder et al 2018 the maximum light detected from a photocell may change depending on the brightness which varies throughout the day but also from a day to another with higher voltages when light is more intense time series from the 12 photocells provide an indication of the local bed level relative to the cross section of the munition and therefore may serve as an indicator of the temporal variability in burial ph data were recorded at a sampling rate of 16 hz and 10 hz for the munitions deployed in the swash zone for the first and second experiment respectively sampling rates of 1 25 hz and 10 hz were instead chosen for the breaker zone again for the first and the second experiment respectively 3 laboratory studies and forcing conditions 3 1 experimental setup and procedure two large scale laboratory experiments were conducted in june and november december 2016 to observe munition response in the swash zone and the breaker zone both experiments were conducted at the littoral warfare environment lwe at the atc in aberdeen maryland usa the lwe outdoor flume fig 2 a is 100 m long almost 30 m wide and permitted munitions testing in near prototype conditions the beach profile was composed of median diameter d 50 0 33 mm sand the sand sorting is 0 48 and is considered poorly graded in addition some cobbles were observed during the experimental runs the two experiments were largely distinguished by the initial foreshore slope tan β 1 16 for test lwe1 and tan β 1 10 for test lwe2 the foreshore profile was adjusted by atc personnel prior to the beginning of each experiment the profile evolved during the course of each experiment without any additional intervention from personnel the approach undertaken to carry out the experiments was similar for both lwe1 and lwe2 the experimental area delimited by the black box in fig 2a spanned several meters either side of the still water shoreline white dash dot line instrumentation and munitions were largely confined to the experimental area picture in fig 2b and schematic in fig 2c munitions were tested in two regions the swash zone and the breaker zone a frame consisting of scaffolding pipes was installed across the profile for deploying sensors only sensors providing data for this paper are described two nortek acoustic doppler velocimeters vectors were positioned in line with the breaker zone munitions vector a and at the seaward end of the frame vector b to record the free surface elevation and near bed flow velocity an array of sensors was affixed to or near the frame in line with the munitions in proximity of the shoreline for the swash zone measurements swash sensors in fig 2 and more detailed configuration in fig 3 the swash sensors used in this paper include a druck ptx1830 pressure transducer pt located at the bed level to measure water depths flow velocity was recorded by a valeport electromagnetic current meter emcm positioned initially at 0 03 m above the bed the pt and emcm were located at the same cross shore and alongshore position with the pt buried in the sand below the emcm two cameras c1 avt prosilica gt1920 and c2 avt prosilica gc655 were used to record video imagery of runup and munition mobility c1 was positioned on the wall of the flume providing imagery of the munition area from the side fig 3b while c2 was installed on the frame aimed downward fig 3a to quantify runup and the munitions motion closest to the frame for lwe1 c2 was not deployed and c1 was positioned at the same alongshore location but more landward an additional camera underwater camera uc was deployed on the frame fig 3 to detect qualitatively information of munitions motion unfortunately imagery of munitions underwater is obscured by the high turbidity of the water bubbles and the presence of sediment in suspension a real time kinematic rtk gps system was used to survey munitions position pre and post run sensor positions and record beach morphology changes the rtk gps antenna was attached to a cart and pushed on a cross shore transect for beach profiling rtk gps data were collected in utm zone 18 and navd88 vertical datum and subsequently transformed to a local x y z coordinate system hereafter all morphology data are shown in the local reference x y z system fig 3 the horizontal origin was set at the still water line landward far end of the flume wall while the origin elevation was set at the initial shoreline elevation the x and y axes indicate the cross shore and alongshore directions respectively positive cross shore alongshore and elevations were set to offshore into the flume wall and upward respectively a right handed coordinate system the munition sensors being housed inside the munition shells are self contained for this reason munition sensors were initialized to record at the beginning of each day to avoid opening closing operations of munition shells between runs in situ sensors and the cameras were cabled and connected to a series of laptop computers located in a command trailer landward of the maximum runup line all sensors involved in the experiment were synchronized via a dedicated time server using a garmin gps receiver and tac32 and dimenion4 software in situ sensors sampled at 16 hz cameras c1 c2 and uc recorded at 40 83 33 and 30 hz respectively waves were run in bursts of 2 5 5 or 10 min the number of conducted runs totaled 33 for experiment lwe1 and 25 for experiment lwe2 table 3 and table 4 respectively the lwe facility has a limited number of wave spectra that can be used as forcing conditions in the wave flume thus the forcing conditions of each run were defined using monochromatic m jonswap j or pierson moskowitz pm spectra the significant wave height ranging from 0 2 to 1 1 m and the peak wave period ranging from 3 to 9 s nearly all possible combinations were tested during the two studies with choices made in an effort to minimize large morphological changes smaller morphological changes simplify sensor adjustment between runs and allow for more data collection as some sensors have a limited vertical measurement range breaker zone munitions were deployed at the beginning of each experiment in 0 8 1 m water depth breaker zone munitions were rarely reset between runs unless battery replacement was required due to time constraints and difficulty locating and surveying munitions in water depths potentially exceeding 1 m swash zone munitions were deployed along the shoreline at the beginning of each run fig 3b hatched area spanning roughly 9 m between the instrument frame and flume wall this wide area allowed the deployment of multiple munitions at the same time swash zone munitions were re deployed at the beginning of each run the experimental procedure adopted during each run consisted of several steps first the swash zone munitions used for a particular run were deployed along the shoreline before the run started figs 2 and 3 position orientation and burial status were recorded for each munition rtk gps surveys of munition position involved either the survey of both the nose and tail of the munition and or the munition center the frame sensors and the cameras were initialized to start recording following surveying waves were forced with variable duration tables 3 and 4 at the end of the run any live recording instrumentation was stopped post run surveys of the orientation burial and position of the munitions were conducted for the swash and the breaker zone munitions orientation measurements were taken with a compass relative to true north later rotated into the local coordinate system and burial status was estimated using a ruler and undisturbed bed level a manual estimate of 0 25 50 75 or 100 buried was made when the munition was submerged and not visible under opaque water 3 2 hydrodynamic and morphology observations time series of water depth h pt cross shore velocity u emcm and video imagery c1 and c2 were measured continuously during each run data treatment was performed prior to analysis to discard signal noise and or times when sensors were not submerged pt data were first adjusted for atmospheric pressure measured by an additional subaerial pt deployed near the field trailer and converted from volts into meters based on laboratory calibrations constructed by lowering into water the sensor to known depths the instantaneous position of the pt and emcm relative to local bed level during a run was estimated based on the position surveyed before and after each run and assuming the bed level changed linearly in time emcm data were removed whenever the sensor was above h i e exposed in air additional quality control for velocity data included discarding spikes based on an absolute velocity threshold depending on the run conditions 1 6 2 9 m s and acceleration threshold 9 81 m s2 examples of quality controlled time series of h and u are shown in fig 4 for monochromatic a c e and irregular b d f waves images collected from c1 and c2 were georeferenced for quantitative analysis lens calibration and the survey of ground control points were used to resolve the geometry of each camera holland et al 1997 where the geometry enables transferring from the two dimensional image reference system to the three dimensional lwe reference system the rectification was performed projecting the original image to the beach surface assuming alongshore uniformity with an xy grid with 0 05 m spacing in both directions a time stack fig 4e and f was formed by sampling the image intensity along a particular cross shore transect the runup curve aagaard and holm 1989 was then detected from the time stack black curves in fig 4e and f using image thresholding and manual correction maximum runup occasionally occurred outside of the field of view spline extrapolation was used to identify maximum runup in these instances each run contains a series of swash events affecting the deployed munitions with the number of events depending on the run duration measurements extracted from sensors and cameras consist of swash duration t s uprush velocity u u backwash velocity u b and horizontal runup r swash events n events were isolated based on local minima in the water depth time series parameters are then sought to represent the conditions contained within a run that may be associated with motion burial swash events for monochromatic waves were ensemble averaged after time normalizing data based on swash duration fig 5 averaging was calculated when data existed such that the certain portions of the time series were not biased over others the maximum value of each measurement type was then retained as a parameter of interest and used for relating to munitions response tables 3 and 4 maximum and minimum deviations from the average σ min and σ max observed among all runs are reported in table 5 averaged σ min and σ max are also shown table 5 ensemble averaging is less appropriate for irregular waves instead the maximum value of each parameter was recorded for the n swash events within a run then the average of the maxima was identified and retained as the parameter of interest histograms of maximum values with the average represented as a black line are reported in fig 6 selecting a smaller value 2 exceedance only alters maximally the chosen parameters by 5 84 and on average 1 62 retained parameters of interest for each run and for the swash zone are reported for experiment lwe1 table 3 and lwe2 table 4 the same approach was undertaken for breaker zone data but solely for water depths and near bed flow velocity named h and u in the breaker zone and obtained from the vector located at the cross shore position near the initial deployment location of breaker zone munitions the mobile beach evolved during the course of the conducted runs with elevations being measured occasionally for lwe1 and after each run for lwe2 fig 7 maximum elevation change magnitudes between successive profile measurements did not exceed 0 3 m and were on average 0 06 m the beach profiles evolved showing net erosion at the shoreline x 0 m and offshore with net accretion landward x 0 m 4 methodology 4 1 dimensionless parameters related to burial and migration two dimensionless numbers have been related to burial of pipelines or objects in a mobile bed the keulegan carpenter kc number and the shields parameter θ the keulegan carpenter number represents the ratio between drag and inertia forces as 1 k c u b t s d the shields parameter indicates the ratio between destabilizing and stabilizing forces for sediment mobilization 2 θ τ b ρ s ρ w g d 50 where ρ s and ρ w are sediment and water densities 2650 kg m3 and 1000 kg m3 respectively and g is the gravitational acceleration the bed shear stress τ b is expressed using a friction coefficient f equal to 0 03 puleo and holland 2001 3 τ b 1 2 ρ w f u b 2 incipient sediment motion is normally assumed to occur for θ 0 05 soulsby and whitehouse 1997 however munition presence on in the bed can lead to increased bed shear stresses truelsen et al 2005 the object mobility number has been related to the object distance traveled rennie 2017 and is defined as 4 θ m u 2 g d ρ m ρ w 1 the object mobility number is mostly used to study initiation of motion and identify the threshold for motion no motion a modified objected mobility number considering the initial burial depth b i may be more appropriate for this study 5 θ m m o d u 2 g d ρ m ρ w 1 d b i d the aim of the present study is to investigate relationships between kc θ θ m mod and other dimensionless numbers with burial and migration for the cases of no motion and motion respectively considering that the lwe experiments mostly occurred in the swash zone parameters such as the foreshore slope and the runup are also considered as potentially important the iribarren number ξ providing the ratio between the foreshore slope and the offshore wave steepness is 6 ξ t a n β h s l 0 t a n β 2 π h s g t p 2 where l 0 is the offshore wave length the iribarren number provides an indication of the type of beach either dissipative ξ 0 5 milder beach slope or reflective ξ 3 3 steeper beach slope dean and dalrymple 2001 4 2 munition migration temporal evolution derivation 4 2 1 munition migration from imagery munition tracking from imagery consists of locating munition x y positions in the rectified image the tracking may be accomplished automatically via image processing algorithms if the object is easily identifiable during the lwe studies multiple munitions were deployed at the same time and most of the motion occurred when the munition was difficult to identify automatically due to the presence of foam therefore munition positions nose and tail were identified manually multiple manual identifications 18 iterations of a particular fixed munition yielded horizontal variability errors of 0 05 m for x and 0 08 m for y essentially the same size as the grid spacing used for image rectification this error is assumed to be consistent for all manual identification munition position identification is not possible when the munition is fully submerged or completely covered by bubbles foam 4 2 2 munition migration in time from imu the imu can overcome some of the imagery limitations since data are recorded continuously a simple algorithm was developed to derive munition trajectories using imu measurements shown schematically in fig 8 a see also frank et al 2016 munitions of cylindrical shape were observed to move mostly due to rolling around x m thus the initial step was to quantify the cumulative angle of rotation ϕ time series around x m second the migration in the lwe reference system x y was determined through the imu heading measurement there are two imu measurements from which ϕ can be estimated the instantaneous orientation relative to x m ϕ roll and the angular velocity around x m ϕ gyro imu sign convention follows the right hand rule clockwise munition rotation around x m yields a positive roll and positive angular velocities cumulative rotation angle is obtained directly from roll simply summing cumulatively the roll time series and subtracting the initial roll differences between ϕ roll and ϕ gyro are discussed in section 6 the distance traveled by the rolling munition is quantified using the munition diameter as 7 s π d ϕ r o l l 360 where s represents the cumulative distance traveled through rotation around x m the combination of s with the time series of heading of x m is used to identify the cross shore and alongshore trajectory components the instantaneous yaw angle determines the angle between x m and magnetic north fig 8b angles a 1 and a 2 respectively indicating the angle difference between magnetic north and true north and true north and x fig 8b are used to alter yaw measurements and determine the munition heading time series γ note that γ ranges between 0 and 360 indicating the heading relative to the lwe horizontal plane on the contrary ϕ roll does not have a 360 limitation and the sign could be either positive or negative depending on the munition migration the steps involved to derive munition trajectory in x y using γ and s are repeated for each instant of time the trajectory d i from time t i 1 to t i is calculated from the distance traveled s i 1 to s i as 8 d i s i s i 1 the heading of x m in the horizontal plane at t i is provided by γ i green arrow in fig 8b depending on the sign of d i the munition rolled either clockwise positive roll positive d i blue arrow in fig 8b or counterclockwise negative roll negative d i red arrow in fig 8c with γ i being the heading relative to the cartesian axis γ i 90 and γ i 90 are the corresponding angles of the red and blue arrows the relative components of d i in x and y d x i and d y i are thus calculated as 9 d x i d i cos γ i 90 cos β 10 d y i d i sin γ i 90 equation 3 accounts for the angle β between the plane where the munition moves beach slope and the horizontal x coordinate the cumulative sum of d x i and d y i provides the time series of the components of motion in x and y respectively the initial munition position from rtk gps surveys or manual measurements is added to d x and d y that have initial values of zero 4 3 munition burial temporal evolution derivation apparent burial time series is estimated for surrogate 155 mm munitions that contained the photocell array each of the 12 photocell voltage time series was normalized by the highest voltage recorded by all 12 photocells during the run the photocell voltage after normalization varies between 0 no light received and 1 maximum light received deriving the amount of burial b defined as burial depth below the mean local bed level friedrichs et al 2016 from the photocell array data is possible if the orientation of the munition from the imu is known at each instant of time there are 24 possible initial orientations from the photocell standpoint considering that either one or two photocells can be oriented downward the 24 orientations are classified as α 15 2 where α 0 15 330 the angular separation distance between photocells the roll angle at time t determines the orientation at time t for instance photocells ph01 and ph02 are oriented downward when α 0 15 2 fig 9 a another example shows a single photocell ph11 oriented downward when α falls in the range 75 15 2 fig 9b note that temporal burial evolution is derived for cases of no motion only cutoff of 0 05 m for cross shore migration thus the change of orientation is relatively small and confined within less than one complete rotation ϕ roll 360 for cases where the imu malfunctioned 5 out of 67 initial munition orientation was determined by the photocell array signal the photocell with the minimum normalized voltage was identified as being oriented downward and thus has an error of 7 5 occasionally multiple photocells had the same minimum normalized voltage at time t 0 for such cases the photocell photocells located in the middle among the lowest voltage photocells was were set as oriented downward an algorithm was implemented to estimate the time history of local bed level relative to the cross section of the 155 mm a normalized threshold of 0 5 for the swash zone and 0 2 for the breaker zone was used to indicate burial or exposure where photocells with a normalized voltage lower than the threshold were considered buried different thresholds were needed in the swash and breaker zones due to water turbidity and depth for the breaker zone munitions light attenuation and the shallower water depth and intermittent exposure to air for the swash zone munitions often multiple photocells appear buried at a given time the arc of buried photocells is divided in half by a vertical line that passes through the circle center fig 9c the local bed level i e burial depth b is set as the same elevation of the highest buried photocells among the highest on the left phl in fig 9c and on the right phr in fig 9c finally b is normalized by the corresponding munition diameter d b d represents the dimensionless burial depth 5 results 5 1 cases tested hereafter each munition tested for a different run is referred to as a case where the total number of cases for swash and breaker zones differs two types of analysis on munitions behavior measurements are conducted for the swash zone one approach focused on pre to post run migration and burial with the aim to relate the response to the forcing conditions through empirical formulations section 5 2 the second approach focused on the time history of migration and burial sections 5 3 and 5 4 one to 10 munitions were deployed in the manner described in section 3 1 with initial orientations of 0 90 180 or 270 for reference system see fig 3b a total of 247 swash cases were accomplished during the two experiments 113 for lwe1 and 134 for lwe2 table 6 cases tested most predictive probabilistic models focus on cross shore migration as such the remainder of the paper will similarly address cross shore migration only there was a wide range of migration fig 10 depending on the beach and forcing conditions and the munition physical characteristics a large number of the munitions 62 had relatively little migration 1 0 m three 155 mm ld and one rkt migrated over 15 m offshore fig 10a a separation was needed to treat differently data of munitions that were mobilized from the ones that remained in place cases were split into two groups referred to as no motion and motion cases table 6 using a migration threshold of 0 05 m bold black line in fig 10b based on observations and the horizontal rtk gps accuracy of 0 02 0 03 m 5 1 1 breaker zone a different approach was undertaken for breaker zone munitions munitions were deployed at the beginning of each experiment simultaneously and only occasionally reset prior to a new run post run surveys of orientation position and burial exist for all cases of lwe2 but only 32 cases of lwe1 therefore the no motion versus motion separation for lwe1 was not undertaken table 6 for lwe2 the same threshold of 0 05 m adopted in the swash was used to separate the cases of motion in general mobility in the breaker zone was observed to be less than in the swash zone additionally the choice of leaving breaker zone munitions in place after each run does not allow an analysis of pre and post run burial and migration since each munition experienced the run starting from a different initial burial status 5 2 pre and post run analysis 5 2 1 burial and migration as a function of kc θ θm and θm mod relationships between burial depth observed from cases of no motion 98 and θ fig 12 a and kc fig 12b were investigated note that cases of different run conditions different munition types and different foreshore slopes are presented together inerts and surrogates are not segregated the color separation indicates the different experiments and thus the foreshore slope milder slope in red tones for lwe1 steeper slope in blue tones for lwe2 the color gradient provides a representation of munition density sixty four of the 98 cases occurred on the milder slope where less migration was observed the shields parameter ranged between 1 3 and 7 5 indicating the presence of sheet flow conditions nielsen 1993 and or bed fluidization kc ranged between 11 6 and 308 1 it appears the munition density played a role for lwe1 cases since denser munitions darker red markers showed greater b d with maximum relative burial of 2 past efforts cataño lopera et al 2007 demir and garcía 2007 friedrichs et al 2016 suggest a power law relationship for dimensionless burial of the form 11 b d a 1 θ b 1 where a 1 and b 1 are fitting coefficients typical values for a 1 b 1 are 1 2 0 33 0 97 0 33 13 1 and 1200 2 4 depending on d and munition shape for lab and field data of objects constantly submerged and in the presence of steady current and no waves friedrichs et al 2016 objects subjected to oscillatory flow or wave and or combined flow conditions yielded b 1 0 8 cataño lopera et al 2007 demir and garcía 2007 note the solid line in fig 12a representing equation 11 with b 1 0 85 was found for short cylinders in oscillatory flow cataño lopera et al 2007 however the shields number for the aforementioned studies was less than 1 the highest correlations with the swash zone data in the present study were for a 1 0 47 and b 1 0 29 but r 2 was only 0 05 previous research cataño lopera et al 2011 friedrichs et al 2016 sumer and fredsøe 2001 also suggest a relationship of the form 12 b d a 2 k c c 2 where a 2 and c 2 are fitting coefficients the two lines in fig 12b were identified for cylinders a 2 0 1 c 2 0 51 and frusta a 2 0 0077 c 2 0 78 for equilibrium burial of fully submerged objects subjected to wave forcing friedrichs et al 2016 similar coefficients were also found by sumer and fredsøe 2001 for fixed pipelines subjected to waves and currents and by cataño lopera et al 2011 for frusta in waves alone and combined flow swash zone observations fall between the two empirical relationships even though they are intermittently submerged and do not reach equilibrium burial coefficients a 2 0 09 and c 2 0 43 were found for the observed burial depths solid line in fig 12b with an r 2 of 0 39 using the object mobility number instead of shields number or kc yielded an r 2 of 0 32 a comparison between the relative burial achieved by the munition at the end of the run and the normalized beach profile changes δz d occurring within the run is shown to investigate the role of the morphodynamic changes in the munition burial process fig 12c the data are shown for no mobility munitions tested for the 1 10 slope beach profiles were not surveyed after every run for lwe1 slope 1 16 experiment the majority of the data had relative burial greater than 0 as most of the munitions were deployed with b i 0 δz 0 0 indicates accretion erosion had occurred the first quadrant in the figure δz 0 and positive burial indicates foreshore accretion and munition burial if the burial processes were governed solely by the beach morphology changes the data would exist along the 1 1 line accretion burial depth however the observations are mostly located above the 1 1 line suggesting that the munition burial on the foreshore is governed additionally by local scour processes when the foreshore eroded δz 0 munitions also experience burial further indicating the importance of local scour processes additional analyses were conducted for the motion group fig 13 with 100 cases for the steeper slope and 49 cases for the milder slope table 6 most of the mobility 69 was offshore directed positive d x with some onshore directed motion for a variety of munitions bulk density the largest offshore migration 15 20 m occurred for the 155 mm ld ρ m 2115 kg m3 fig 13 the lowest density munition tested on the milder sloping beach interestingly some 155 mm ld also migrated onshore yielding the three largest onshore directed migrations observed of 2 5 4 3 and 5 1 m θ 2 3 3 5 in contrast the similarly shaped 155 mm ρ m 4230 kg m3 had average offshore migration distances of only 0 1 m regardless of forcing or slope conditions there was an exception where one 155 mm migrated offshore 4 2 m under the most intense forcing conditions but another 155 mm deployed initially at the same cross shore position migrated only 0 14 m no 155 mm were observed to migrate onshore comparisons for migration were also made with the object mobility numbers the maximum object mobility number observed was 1 53 however the majority of the motion data had θ m 1 09 similarly for θ m mod there is no substantial difference between the relationships found for migration with θ m fig 13a and θ m mod fig 13b as most of the munitions were typically deployed proud initially the extra factor included in θ m mod that accounts for initial burial depth eq 5 varies between 0 100 initial burial or more and 1 0 initial burial under equal conditions a larger object mobility number should indicate a larger potential for the object to be mobilized note in fig 13b the data points in proximity of θ m mod between 0 and 0 2 with the mobility number reduced by the extra factor both plots indicate scatter but with denser munitions migrating shorter distances interestingly different d x were observed under the same mobility number i e same flow velocity for the same type of munition these cases were observed mostly for rkt and 81 mm with travel distances ranging from 1 6 to 7 8 m for θ m 0 89 and 0 07 4 1 m for θ m 0 4 respectively there are not enough burial cases for regular wave forcing conditions squares in fig 12 to make a comparison or differentiation between regular and irregular waves playing a role in burial response in addition there is no obvious differentiation in the migration data fig 13 in regular square symbols and irregular circles wave groups either the short wave bursts and the use of bulk quantities in the analysis might not provide a significant difference between wave spectra considered 5 2 2 burial and migration semi empirical formulation numerous potential parameters could be associated with munitions burial kc and θ already tested individually a nonlinear least squares regression of the form 13 b d a 3 θ b 3 k c c 3 was tested yielding a 3 0 06 b 3 0 24 and c 3 0 5 fig 14 a the r 2 value is 0 45 with a best fit slope and intercept of 0 94 and 0 046 respectively a similar coefficient c 3 was found previously for cylinders c 3 0 51 friedrichs et al 2016 and fixed pipelines c 3 0 50 sumer and fredsøe 2001 additional model tests of the form b d aq 1 b q 2 c q 3 d where q i indicates a different dimensionless quantity were tested a slight improvement is obtained incorporating the munition shape and the iribarren number 14 b d a 4 θ b 4 k c c 4 d l d ξ e the coefficients a 4 0 07 and c 4 0 49 are similar to a 3 and c 3 obtained for equation 13 while b 4 d and e are 0 35 0 14 and 0 12 respectively the squared correlation coefficient improves by only 0 03 fig 14b which must be weighed against the inclusion of three additional fitting coefficients removing ξ decreases the correlation by 0 01 with r 2 0 48 migration was also correlated with θ m and θ m mod a nonlinear least squares regression analysis was conducted similar to that for burial data and following the same form of equations 13 and 14 θ m and θ m mod alone cannot fully explain the migration processes the squared correlation coefficient found is nearly zero r 2 0 05 adding the ratio ρ m ρ w increases r 2 substantially r 2 0 27 confirming that density plays a fundamental role in migration processes the semi empirical formulation with the highest r 2 0 37 found is 15 d x a 5 θ m m o d b 5 ρ m ρ w c 5 ξ d 5 yielding a 5 25 65 b 5 0 75 c 5 2 59 and d 5 0 26 not shown other parameters such as runup foreshore slope alone not included in the iribarren number and the initial orientation of the munition were tested without significant improvement in correlation 5 3 migration time evolution 5 3 1 application of imu algorithm for migration and algorithm reliability application of the algorithm for run 58 and a 81 mm munition see table 4 for run conditions is shown in fig 15 as an example imu data are compared with data obtained using imagery time series are shown only for a window of 92 s until munition motion ceased the first two panels fig 15a and b contain imu measurements raw roll angle ranges from 180 to 180 fig 15a and oscillates with each wave indicative of munition rolling the instantaneous orientation of the munition fig 15b determined with the imu solid line follows the trend estimated from imagery circles the cumulative angle of rotation fig 15c is positive with a final value corresponding to nearly 14 rotations offshore finally the cross shore migration d x magenta matches well that derived from imagery filled circles fig 15d the background image is the corresponding time stack obtained from c1 while the black filled circle indicates the x coordinate of the munition surveyed by the rtk gps at the end of the run the munition of interest was deployed at the shoreline circled in fig 15e at t 1 with an initial orientation of 186 the munition remained fixed until roughly 50 s when it was impacted by the 4th wave of the run the orientation changed such that x m went from roughly perpendicular to roughly parallel to the shoreline from 186 to 98 an onshore migration of 0 3 m was followed by a 1 5 m offshore migration snapshots in fig 15e at t 2 and t 3 before the munition motion stopped circled in fig 15e at t 4 imaged derived and imu positions align until they diverge towards the end of this offshore motion with an offset of 0 46 m at 56 22 s a similar behavior of net offshore migration is evident for the next two waves after each swash event the munition stopped in a location more offshore than the previous during the 7th wave of the run the munition moved again with net offshore transport this time the motion was detected only from the imu and not from the imagery due to lack of visibility the imu heading measurement indicates a change of orientation from 98 to 17 and hence x m was again roughly perpendicular to the shoreline after t 5 the munition remained fixed as indicated by a constant imu x 1 73 m the angle differences between imu and image derived headings are generally less than 20 for this specific case the largest error between image derived and imu derived cross shore locations is 0 7 m migration was captured from c1 only towards the ends of backwash due to visibility issues post run cross shore munition position surveyed with the rtk gps yielded a difference of 0 19 m if compared with the imu derived position the munition when mobilized showed the same trend of motion for each swash event a small onshore movement followed by a larger offshore migration munition trajectories and post run positions derived from the imu are affected by error see section 6 the rtk gps and imagery were used to determine the magnitude of the imu error for swash zone and breaker zone munitions post run rtk gps surveys were compared with the post run locations derived from imu for cross shore fig 16 a and alongshore components fig 16b the least squares fit for cross shore alongshore migration has a slope of 0 69 0 8 and an intercept of 0 05 0 15 with a squared correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 62 r 2 of 0 51 a similar analysis was carried out to compare munition locations derived from the imu with those derived from imagery solely for swash zone cases cross shore fig 16c alongshore fig 16d larger error is estimated for cross shore motion r 2 of 0 49 if compared to the alongshore direction r 2 of 0 75 for the imu slopes and intercepts of least squares fits are 0 68 and 0 48 for cross shore and 0 85 and 0 97 for alongshore respectively 5 3 2 migration observations the developed imu algorithm was applied to all available cases for 155 mm 81 mm and rkt munitions deployed in the swash and breaker zones for both regions cases were separated into two categories based on the total migration no motion motion less than 0 05 m and motion motion greater than 0 05 m there were 31 cases for no motion and 40 cases for motion in the swash zone table 6 imu the corresponding numbers for the breaker zone munitions were 225 and 37 table 6 imu swash zone observations of cross shore migration are shown for the three munition types fig 17 only for cross shore migration and for cases of motion thirty two out of 40 cases of motion are associated with the steeper foreshore slope lwe2 blue curves the majority of the cases 34 out of 40 belong to rkt and 81 mm munitions the rkt and 81 mm of comparable length and diameter often migrated up to 4 m offshore with some exceptions up to 8 m in addition rkt and 81 mm often mimicked the runup curve rolling upslope during uprush and downslope during backwash with incremental net motion offshore the maximum offshore migration for the few cases of motion for the 155 mm munition 6 out of 40 was 4 m the 155 mm munitions did not mimic the rkt and 81 mm in terms of intra wave onshore and offshore motions and instead migrated more erratically with a net offshore motion migration does not appear to be correlated solely to the forcing θ as the largest traveled distances are not always related to the largest forcing the modified object mobility number ranges ascribed the three munitions were 0 52 0 98 for rkt 0 16 0 33 for 155 mm and 0 33 0 68 for 81 mm the largest migration distances for rkt 8 7 m 155 mm 3 9 m and 81 mm 8 2 m occurred for θ m mod of 0 75 0 24 and 0 40 respectively again showing inconsistent variability in migration distance as a function of the forcing breaker zone munition cases experienced less motion compared to the swash zone munition cases there are 37 cases of motion against 125 cases of no motion table 6 imu occurring for 81 mm and rkt munitions only trajectories for the 81 mm munition not shown are confined within an onshore migration of 1 m and an offshore migration of 0 5 m the corresponding values for the rkt were 1 m and 2 m respectively no dominance in motion direction onshore offshore was observed 5 4 burial time evolution results 5 4 1 application of photocells burial algorithm and algorithm reliability an example from run 52 from lwe2 illustrates the approach to identify apparent burial time history fig 18 the munition was deployed proud at the shoreline snapshot taken from uc fig 18g t 1 the munition rolled offshore less than a complete rotation during the first five swash events and became buried roughly half of its diameter panels a e are sub divided into three time windows corresponding to the beginning of the run 0 10 s the section where the munition rolled 20 120 s and the end of the run 310 330 s the first two panels fig 18a and b indicate the hydrodynamics showing water depth and cross shore flow velocities respectively water depths started with values of 0 26 m and decreased to 0 20 m at approximately t 3 velocity magnitudes reached maxima of 1 2 m s for the uprush and 1 6 m s for the backwash the initial ϕ roll was 109 8 indicating a munition orientation with ph08 and ph09 oriented downward ph09 and ph04 had normalized voltages of roughly 0 and 1 respectively fig 18c only five photocells out of 12 are shown for clarity these photocell values match the recorded initial deployment orientation no motion occurred prior 30 s at t 2 an offshore directed rotation of 23 9 from 109 8 to 133 7 fig 18d caused ph09 to point downward fig 18h t 2 the relative bed level was 0 27 fig 18e f and 18h and ph02 and ph04 had a normalized voltage of nearly 1 fig 18c between t 2 and t 3 the munition continued rolling offshore the rotation angle was 124 6 from 133 7 to 258 3 fig 18d leading to ph04 and ph06 being oriented downward fig 18h t 3 both ph04 and ph06 had a normalized voltage of 0 while ph09 and ph12 had a signal near 1 fig 18h normalized burial depth b d reached a maximum value of 0 55 fig 18e f and 18h after t 3 the munition rolled slightly more offshore with ph04 oriented downward fig 18h at t 4 and ph02 having normalized voltage less than 0 5 within the time window 120 310 s the munition remained fixed with no appreciable changes in burial the burial detected from the photocell array at the end of each run was compared least squares to the corresponding post run survey of burial status to estimate the errors in the developed algorithm fig 19 the best fit line is characterized by a slope of 0 88 an intercept of 0 04 and an r 2 of 0 73 however the judgement parameter manual burial measurements is affected by the discretized nature of collection described earlier an error of 25 6 discussion 6 1 migration data from a large scale laboratory study under near prototype forcing conditions showed initially proud munitions in medium sand in the swash zone and breaker zone can be mobilized migration data were captured using rtk gps equipment georeferenced imagery and inertial motion units inside some of the munitions munitions located in the swash zone generally mimicked the runup curve with a slight onshore migration followed by a more prolonged offshore migration fig 17 in addition munitions tend to migrate the most during the initial stages of forcing fig 17 migration slows or ceases when munitions enter deeper water and are offshore of bore collapse or when they are located landward beyond the extent where backwash forcing is capable of remobilization fig 17 the net migration of swash zone munitions was mostly offshore directed figs 13 and 17 with only 46 out of 149 cases 31 of net landward migration observed cross shore migration showed some relationship with munition density with the less dense munitions generally migrating farther offshore maximum distance of 20 m and the most dense munitions having small or no migration fig 13 no obvious relation was found between the distance traveled and the object mobility number or the modified object mobility number breaker zone munitions were not reset in between runs implying variable initial burial depths and all munitions tended to exhibit less migration munitions migrated maximally 3 4 m onshore and 3 6 m offshore with no preferential migration direction 58 cases migrated offshore 57 cases migrated onshore and 225 cases migrated less than 0 05 m fig 11 munition migration distances were variable under the same offshore forcing conditions same munitions placement and same munitions density indicating local small scale hydrodynamic and sediment transport processes are vitally important for predicting munitions processes the variability in swash zone migration could not be well described using empirical formulations related to offshore forcing namely the munition bulk density object mobility shields and iribarren numbers with squared correlation coefficients of only 0 37 maximally additional tests incorporating initial munition orientation and dimensionless runup were unsuccessful poor correlation between forcing and migration distance was not fully unexpected considering for example the variability in migration with object mobility number fig 17 larger object mobility number does not equate to larger migration distances the data obtained here show that swash zone munitions tend to migrate offshore the question arises as to how munitions are occasionally found on beaches one option is that munitions appear on the foreshore through erosion of dunes or the foreshore through the process of exhumation a second option is munitions are transported to the foreshore from a more offshore location indeed lwe data showed that some onshore migration can occur but there was no preferential direction of migration for breaker zone munitions and migration distances were small the latter possibly due to the short run durations however the lwe studies were limited by necessity in several ways that could be circumvented in the future 1 the water level was not altered during the study altered water levels tides would change the location of wave breaking forcing and could perhaps change munition migration patterns 2 the foreshore slopes for both studies were fairly steep 1 16 and 1 10 causing the downslope component of gravity to be a major driving force in munitions migration the lwe facility could not accommodate a much shallower sloping foreshore indicative of a dissipative beach a shallower sloping beach would de emphasize the downslope gravity component and perhaps enable more capability for net onshore migration especially with tidal variations 3 forcing conditions were near prototype for what might be identified as moderate forcing extreme event forcing could not be tested but would likely be able to force an additional component of onshore migration perhaps leading to net migration in that direction indeed analyses uxo mobility model indicated munitions initiated far offshore could experience net onshore transport and exposure under high energy waves and currents navfac 2013 but the ability to be stranded on the foreshore was not tested 4 all munitions tested were deployed initially proud except subsequent runs in the breaker zone when munitions were not reset yet migration is expected to be reduced when forcing acts upon partially buried munitions such that the conditions tested at lwe provided the best opportunity under the forcing used for munitions to experience a net onshore migration 6 2 burial burial observations at lwe were governed by both foreshore morphologic changes as well as local scour processes fig 12c burial data indicated again the importance of munitions bulk density with the denser munitions having a greater relative burial depth fig 12a b maximum burial b d 2 was observed for the 20 mm with a bulk density of 7990 kg m3 fluidization of the seabed may be one reason why b d reached values greater than 1 note that previous studies of object burial generally occurred under non sheet flow conditions friedrichs et al 2016 identified more than 600 cases of reported munitions like object burial by waves or waves currents in sand with more than the 95 for shields parameters less than 0 6 and none exceeding 2 in contrast the observations made at lwe in the swash zone are associated with greater shields numbers 1 3 7 5 the scour processes in sheet flow conditions and a fluidized bed may be different than those investigated by previous studies sheet flow conditions may enable dense objects to sink through the fluidized bed enhancing burial additional measurements and analysis would be required to further test this concept equilibrium scour burial under combined waves and currents has been related to dimensionless forcing parameters keulegan carpenter number and shields parameter with some success cataño lopera et al 2011 friedrichs et al 2016 sumer and fredsøe 2001 attempts using the parameters alone or in tandem provided moderate squared correlation coefficients with respect to relative burial depth r 2 0 45 and r 2 0 48 fig 14a thus only roughly 50 of the variability in relative burial depth can be explained by these simple relationships for non equilibrium burial depth 6 3 sensor capability 6 3 1 inertial motion unit munition trajectories and final positions inferred from a simple algorithm were similar with moderate correlation r 2 roughly 0 5 to those inferred from imagery and pre and post run rtk gps measurements moderate correlation might be expected considering the imu is a low cost sensor and trajectories are affected by compounding error and data processing issues the cumulative angle of rotation ϕ roll was derived directly from the roll angle measurements however ϕ can also be derived indirectly by integrating the angular velocity time series from the gyroscope comparisons were made between the two approaches in the gyroscope derived ϕ gyro approach a cutoff of 10 s was used to neglect angular velocity data assumed to be associated with sensor noise a cutoff is necessary because integrating small angular velocities an extended period of time when the munition is actually stationary can lead to large error in ϕ frank et al 2016 the error between ϕ roll and ϕ gyro was estimated for each case belonging to the motion group as 16 e r r o r 100 ϕ r o l l t e n d ϕ g y r o t e n d ϕ r o l l t e n d where t end refers to the end of the run the average error for the 71 swash and breaker zone cases when the gyroscope also collected data was 13 5 with an error range of 0 09 70 the roll angle was chosen for migration distance in this paper because roll and heading data are associated to the same time vector that differs from gyroscope time vector on the imu guaranteeing consistent data sampling and time synchronization the trajectory regardless of how the roll is quantified is found cumulatively thus any measurement error compounds over time other imu vendors caution against using imu data for position for long data records because the errors grow exponentially ch robotics the error is likely to be exacerbated using the gyroscope data because a double integration is required to obtain position 6 3 2 photocell array manual measurements of burial were made post run and using photocells on some 155 mm surrogate munitions r 2 0 73 apparent burial time histories were derived from array of photocells similar to optical or acoustical rings used around surrogate mines used in past efforts bradley et al 2007 traykovski et al 2007 normalized voltage thresholds of 0 5 were chosen for the swash zone and 0 2 for the breaker zone the difference in threshold was due to intermittent emergence of the swash zone munitions and continually submergence of the breaker zone munitions under opaque water several examples of dimensionless burial depth b d curves show a similar trend fig 20 swash zone munitions experienced a rapid increase of relative burial depth at initial stages of the run followed by an approximately constant b d for the remainder of the run the observed trend matches the burial temporal evolution of cylinders in oscillatory flow demir and garcía 2007 however the fairly constant normalized voltage for the majority of the run may also be attributed to light attenuation through the water causing the apparent burial of the munition normalized voltages decreased after wave forcing ceased causing the apparent burial to decrease however there is no physical mechanism without wave forcing that would exhume the munitions instead the decrease in burial depth implies photocells overestimate the actual burial depth during the run due to the difficulties in separating actual burial photocell covered by deposited sand from apparent burial photocell covered by turbid water thus the decrease in normalized voltage after wave forcing is attributed to sediment settling post run post wave activity some swash zone cases appeared to confirm apparent burial where for instance a 155 mm deployed initially proud b d 0 experienced 100 burial b d 1 confirmed by manual surveys grey curve in fig 20 the findings suggest the photocells are likely appropriate for identifying burial on longer time scales in more opaque water or in the swash zone and for shorter time scales in less opaque water 7 conclusions inert and sensor enabled surrogate munitions were tested in a large scale wave flume containing medium sand to identify migration and burial characteristics under near prototype wave forcing in bursts of 2 5 10 min munitions tested on two different steep foreshore slopes preferentially experienced a net offshore directed migration less dense munitions or remained relatively fixed in the horizontal and buried more dense munitions only 46 out of 149 swash zone cases 31 experienced a net onshore directed migration most of the swash zone munitions that migrated offshore began to bury once motion ceased there was no preferential direction for breaker zone munitions and migration distances were less than 3 6 m regardless of cross shore position denser munitions buried more deeply than less dense munitions the density threshold for initial migration vs burial was around 4000 kg m3 estimated from the limited number of munitions tested findings from the short wave bursts would indicate that munitions that exist on natural foreshores are likely to have been delivered there from farther landward during extreme events e g dune erosion or have already existed on the foreshore and been exhumed tests consisting of longer duration runs over shallower sloping beach profiles and or during extreme events are needed to determine if munitions can be readily transported from offshore to the foreshore empirical relationships between common dimensionless parameters such as the keulegan carpenter number shields parameter and object mobility number could only describe 50 of the observed variance in munitions burial and 37 of the observed migration some of the lack of skill is attributed to the short wave burst testing where munitions did not reach equilibrium burial or perhaps a final migration distance credit authorship contribution statement demetra cristaudo

21902,behavior of underwater unexploded ordnance located on the sea bed is poorly understood different types of munitions were tested in the swash and breaker zones of a large scale flume containing medium sand on two initial foreshore slopes 1 16 and 1 10 with regular and irregular wave forcing hs 0 3 1 1 m t p 2 6 9 s migration and burial were measured via pre and post run surveys and internal munition sensors water depths flow velocities wave runup and beach morphology changes were also measured munition sensors consist of an inertial motion unit for roll and heading and optical photocells for burial munition migration distances in the swash zone were greatest for the steeper slope and lower density munitions munition migration mimicked wave runup with net offshore transport breaker zone munitions experienced episodes of onshore and offshore directed motion without preferred direction denser munitions were observed to bury deeper up to 2 munition diameters moderate correlation was observed between burial r 2 0 48 or migration r 2 0 37 with dimensionless parameters such as shields parameter keulegan carpenter number object mobility number munition density and iribarren number attributed to the high variability in munition response even under similar offshore forcing conditions keywords unexploded ordnance swash zone migration burial inertial motion unit 1 introduction the presence of unexploded ordnance uxo or munitions on the seafloor especially in the nearshore is a worldwide concern there are more than 400 formerly used defense sites fuds serdp 2010 in the united states alone where munition launch training disposal and other military activities were conducted leading to the potential for uxo presence in the nearshore environment munitions may be mobilized under wave and current forcing and perhaps transported towards the beach shore posing a risk for the public macdonald et al 2004 motion and burial of objects e g cobbles cylinders conical frusta surrogate munitions has been investigated for different environments including energetic nearshore regions table 1 many of the studies were conducted in small scale wave flumes waves with and without a superimposed current or a simple accelerating flow or flow tunnels under oscillatory flows empirical formulations between burial depth and dimensionless numbers such as the keulegan carpenter number the shields parameter and the object mobility number were identified voropayev et al 2003a cataño lopera et al 2007 2011 demir and garcía 2007 friedrichs et al 2016 rennie et al 2017 initiation of motion was investigated through laboratory experiments identifying the critical object mobility number of underwater cylinders as a function of the ratio between object diameter and bed roughness rennie et al 2017 field studies of surrogate munitions in the surf zone traykovski and austin 2017 and seaward of the surf zone calantoni 2014 have recognized munition density as an important quantity for determining munition mobilization densities lower than saturated sediment density or no mobilization higher densities the majority of the aforementioned studies were conducted in the surf zone or deep water or in oscillatory flow tunnels where the object is continuously submerged there is a lack of knowledge of munition processes in the swash zone the portion of the beach where flows intermittently inundate the beach face the swash zone is highly energetic dynamic and swash processes are different than those occurring in the other regions of the nearshore the motion of cobbles in the swash zone was studied in the laboratory using a dam break mechanism over a solid impermeable sloping bottom luccio 1998 in particular cross shore displacement was measured for different cobble characteristics density size shape and different forcing conditions a theoretical model was implemented and compared with the results obtained from the experiment collection of data in the swash zone over a permeable mobile bed which include the scour burial processes and interaction of the object with the bottom have been accomplished in a more recent laboratory study gross and puleo 2019 however no field or large scale laboratory data on munitions processes in the swash zone to the authors knowledge have been collected ongoing efforts are using probabilistic models to predict munitions migrations distances from their initial location and munition burial exposure status the underwater munitions expert system unmes rennie 2017 provides probabilities on whether a munition remains in place or migrates either near or far from the initial position the distance traveled is estimated as a function of the mobility number of the munition the model relies on recent uxo mobility observations traykovski and austin 2017 rennie et al 2017 other than migration unmes also predicts the degree of burial of munitions via relationships obtained from the scientific and engineering literature unmes is designed for wave dominated climates over non cohesive sands where bottom orbital flows are the main forcing mechanism the model has not yet been validated for munitions status in intermittently submerged nearshore environments thus unmes and other models for predicting munitions burial exposure will benefit from observations of munitions processes in the swash zone the objective of this paper is to investigate how different swash zone hydrodynamic forcing conditions and beach slopes influence the behavior of munitions behavior is described in terms of cross shore migration and burial exposure relative to the local bed level two large scale laboratory studies were conducted yielding simultaneous measurements of hydrodynamics and morphology data and migration and burial of realistic munition surrogates and inert munitions the tested surrogates of different shapes dimensions and densities were designed and fabricated to mimic actual munitions and some have the capability of being instrumented although the studies focused mainly on the behavior of munitions in swash zone observations from munitions deployed in the breaker zone help determine ability for munitions to migrate to the swash zone 2 munitions 2 1 munitions tested during the experiments eight different types of munitions were tested during the experiments 20 mm and 40 mm projectiles 81 mm mortar blu 26 and blu 61 cluster bombs m151 70 hydra rocket and two varieties of m107 155 mm high explosive howitzer projectiles with the same dimensions but different bulk densities fig 1 hereafter each munition type is identified with an id for clarity table 2 the selected munitions were chosen from a larger group of potential munitions in underwater environments based on discussions with a group of munitions mobility researchers calantoni 2014 the strategic environmental research and development program serdp maintains a standardized target repository from which the subset list is contained the eight munitions have different physical characteristics shape bulk density ρ m diameter d and length l table 2 noting that those physical characteristics may play a role in their mobility burial the munitions are small caliber diameter and cover a wide range of bulk densities 2115 7990 kg m3 and dimensions both in length 0 065 0 8 m and diameters 0 02 0 155 m fig 1 and table 2 most of the munitions have an elongated shape referred to as cylindrical with d l ratios of 0 168 0 266 whereas the two cluster bombs are nearly spherical d l 1 except for the raised spin arm flutes the munitions used for the present study are comprised of two categories inerts and surrogates inert is a real munition that is inactive no explosive component inside inerts were provided by the aberdeen test center atc serdp repository in aberdeen maryland usa the other set includes objects designed fabricated to mimic the physical characteristics of real munitions and are referred to as surrogate munitions surrogate munitions were instrumented where possible a detailed description of the surrogate munitions can be found in bruder et al 2018 hereafter the term munition will be used without regard to inert or surrogate except where necessary for clarification 2 2 surrogate munitions design and instrumentation six out of the eight munition types were fabricated 20 mm 40 mm 81 mm blu 61 rkt and 155 mm the other two types blu 26 cluster bomb and a variant of the 155 mm high explosive howitzer projectile 155 mm ld were not replicated but still used in the inert form during the study two of the fabricated munitions 20 mm and 40 mm do not have the internal volume capacity to be instrumented the larger surrogate munitions were designed with the main scope of having realistic objects with the capacity to fit sensors inside their shells the sensors are able to measure one or more of the components of the munition behavior quantification of the physical characteristics e g length diameter center of mass density and axial moment of inertia were made at the serdp repository military manuals federation of american scientists 2017 harms 1978 rogers and celmins 2009 wessam and chen 2015 were also consulted three construction materials were used in combination to achieve similarity with real munitions 20 glass filled delrin 6061 t6 aluminum and 304 304l stainless steel density of 1560 2720 and 7999 kg m3 respectively design in autocad consisted of decomposing the munition into an array of simple geometrical shapes cylinders frusta cones to simplify the actual construction process errors between the physical characteristics of the surrogate and the actual corresponding munition were minimized by assigning different materials to different shapes as well as varying the shell thickness absolute errors of surrogate physical characteristics ranged between 0 and 16 3 note that there are numerous iterations of a given real munition type depending on internal chemical composition fabrication material and shape characteristics calantoni 2017 therefore characteristic variation less than 20 for the particular set of munitions is deemed acceptable for this study 2 2 1 migration tracking sensor x io technologies inertial motion unit imu is a compact self contained low cost sensor equipped with an accelerometer a gyroscope and a magnetometer imu measurement capabilities include triple axis accelerations angular velocity around each of the three axes euler angles roll pitch and yaw quaternion angles and rotation matrix elements cost effectiveness and deployment ease are key features of the imu the sensor is housed inside the surrogate munitions and may be connected to an external battery internal to the munition for extended measurements data are saved to an sd card the imu fits inside each of the surrogates capable of housing sensors however imu data in this paper are shown only from 155 mm 81 mm and rkt the near spherical shape of the blu 61 allows the munition to rotate around all axes complicating the derivation of migration distance the reference system of the imu matches the reference system of the surrogates and is denoted as x m y m z m where x m corresponds to the axis that passes through the longest dimension of the munition with positive x m pointing towards the nose of the object the imu is equipped with an attitude heading and referencing system ahrs algorithm thus the heading of the munition relative to earth may be determined based on yaw angle measurements the intent was to derive the munition migration in the local reference system combining the temporal history of the roll and yaw measurements imu sampling rate during both studies was 256 hz except for the swash zone region during the first experiment where the sampling rate was 512 hz 2 2 2 burial tracking sensor luna optoelectronics to 8 hermetic nsl 4960 photocell ph is an optical sensor that detects the amount of received light and converts it into a voltage signal the 155 mm munitions were designed with an array of 12 photocells surrounding the circumference of the cross section other surrogates did not house ph due to space constraints photocells are wired to 3 6 v aa sized batteries for power and then to microedge data loggers to record data bruder et al 2018 the maximum light detected from a photocell may change depending on the brightness which varies throughout the day but also from a day to another with higher voltages when light is more intense time series from the 12 photocells provide an indication of the local bed level relative to the cross section of the munition and therefore may serve as an indicator of the temporal variability in burial ph data were recorded at a sampling rate of 16 hz and 10 hz for the munitions deployed in the swash zone for the first and second experiment respectively sampling rates of 1 25 hz and 10 hz were instead chosen for the breaker zone again for the first and the second experiment respectively 3 laboratory studies and forcing conditions 3 1 experimental setup and procedure two large scale laboratory experiments were conducted in june and november december 2016 to observe munition response in the swash zone and the breaker zone both experiments were conducted at the littoral warfare environment lwe at the atc in aberdeen maryland usa the lwe outdoor flume fig 2 a is 100 m long almost 30 m wide and permitted munitions testing in near prototype conditions the beach profile was composed of median diameter d 50 0 33 mm sand the sand sorting is 0 48 and is considered poorly graded in addition some cobbles were observed during the experimental runs the two experiments were largely distinguished by the initial foreshore slope tan β 1 16 for test lwe1 and tan β 1 10 for test lwe2 the foreshore profile was adjusted by atc personnel prior to the beginning of each experiment the profile evolved during the course of each experiment without any additional intervention from personnel the approach undertaken to carry out the experiments was similar for both lwe1 and lwe2 the experimental area delimited by the black box in fig 2a spanned several meters either side of the still water shoreline white dash dot line instrumentation and munitions were largely confined to the experimental area picture in fig 2b and schematic in fig 2c munitions were tested in two regions the swash zone and the breaker zone a frame consisting of scaffolding pipes was installed across the profile for deploying sensors only sensors providing data for this paper are described two nortek acoustic doppler velocimeters vectors were positioned in line with the breaker zone munitions vector a and at the seaward end of the frame vector b to record the free surface elevation and near bed flow velocity an array of sensors was affixed to or near the frame in line with the munitions in proximity of the shoreline for the swash zone measurements swash sensors in fig 2 and more detailed configuration in fig 3 the swash sensors used in this paper include a druck ptx1830 pressure transducer pt located at the bed level to measure water depths flow velocity was recorded by a valeport electromagnetic current meter emcm positioned initially at 0 03 m above the bed the pt and emcm were located at the same cross shore and alongshore position with the pt buried in the sand below the emcm two cameras c1 avt prosilica gt1920 and c2 avt prosilica gc655 were used to record video imagery of runup and munition mobility c1 was positioned on the wall of the flume providing imagery of the munition area from the side fig 3b while c2 was installed on the frame aimed downward fig 3a to quantify runup and the munitions motion closest to the frame for lwe1 c2 was not deployed and c1 was positioned at the same alongshore location but more landward an additional camera underwater camera uc was deployed on the frame fig 3 to detect qualitatively information of munitions motion unfortunately imagery of munitions underwater is obscured by the high turbidity of the water bubbles and the presence of sediment in suspension a real time kinematic rtk gps system was used to survey munitions position pre and post run sensor positions and record beach morphology changes the rtk gps antenna was attached to a cart and pushed on a cross shore transect for beach profiling rtk gps data were collected in utm zone 18 and navd88 vertical datum and subsequently transformed to a local x y z coordinate system hereafter all morphology data are shown in the local reference x y z system fig 3 the horizontal origin was set at the still water line landward far end of the flume wall while the origin elevation was set at the initial shoreline elevation the x and y axes indicate the cross shore and alongshore directions respectively positive cross shore alongshore and elevations were set to offshore into the flume wall and upward respectively a right handed coordinate system the munition sensors being housed inside the munition shells are self contained for this reason munition sensors were initialized to record at the beginning of each day to avoid opening closing operations of munition shells between runs in situ sensors and the cameras were cabled and connected to a series of laptop computers located in a command trailer landward of the maximum runup line all sensors involved in the experiment were synchronized via a dedicated time server using a garmin gps receiver and tac32 and dimenion4 software in situ sensors sampled at 16 hz cameras c1 c2 and uc recorded at 40 83 33 and 30 hz respectively waves were run in bursts of 2 5 5 or 10 min the number of conducted runs totaled 33 for experiment lwe1 and 25 for experiment lwe2 table 3 and table 4 respectively the lwe facility has a limited number of wave spectra that can be used as forcing conditions in the wave flume thus the forcing conditions of each run were defined using monochromatic m jonswap j or pierson moskowitz pm spectra the significant wave height ranging from 0 2 to 1 1 m and the peak wave period ranging from 3 to 9 s nearly all possible combinations were tested during the two studies with choices made in an effort to minimize large morphological changes smaller morphological changes simplify sensor adjustment between runs and allow for more data collection as some sensors have a limited vertical measurement range breaker zone munitions were deployed at the beginning of each experiment in 0 8 1 m water depth breaker zone munitions were rarely reset between runs unless battery replacement was required due to time constraints and difficulty locating and surveying munitions in water depths potentially exceeding 1 m swash zone munitions were deployed along the shoreline at the beginning of each run fig 3b hatched area spanning roughly 9 m between the instrument frame and flume wall this wide area allowed the deployment of multiple munitions at the same time swash zone munitions were re deployed at the beginning of each run the experimental procedure adopted during each run consisted of several steps first the swash zone munitions used for a particular run were deployed along the shoreline before the run started figs 2 and 3 position orientation and burial status were recorded for each munition rtk gps surveys of munition position involved either the survey of both the nose and tail of the munition and or the munition center the frame sensors and the cameras were initialized to start recording following surveying waves were forced with variable duration tables 3 and 4 at the end of the run any live recording instrumentation was stopped post run surveys of the orientation burial and position of the munitions were conducted for the swash and the breaker zone munitions orientation measurements were taken with a compass relative to true north later rotated into the local coordinate system and burial status was estimated using a ruler and undisturbed bed level a manual estimate of 0 25 50 75 or 100 buried was made when the munition was submerged and not visible under opaque water 3 2 hydrodynamic and morphology observations time series of water depth h pt cross shore velocity u emcm and video imagery c1 and c2 were measured continuously during each run data treatment was performed prior to analysis to discard signal noise and or times when sensors were not submerged pt data were first adjusted for atmospheric pressure measured by an additional subaerial pt deployed near the field trailer and converted from volts into meters based on laboratory calibrations constructed by lowering into water the sensor to known depths the instantaneous position of the pt and emcm relative to local bed level during a run was estimated based on the position surveyed before and after each run and assuming the bed level changed linearly in time emcm data were removed whenever the sensor was above h i e exposed in air additional quality control for velocity data included discarding spikes based on an absolute velocity threshold depending on the run conditions 1 6 2 9 m s and acceleration threshold 9 81 m s2 examples of quality controlled time series of h and u are shown in fig 4 for monochromatic a c e and irregular b d f waves images collected from c1 and c2 were georeferenced for quantitative analysis lens calibration and the survey of ground control points were used to resolve the geometry of each camera holland et al 1997 where the geometry enables transferring from the two dimensional image reference system to the three dimensional lwe reference system the rectification was performed projecting the original image to the beach surface assuming alongshore uniformity with an xy grid with 0 05 m spacing in both directions a time stack fig 4e and f was formed by sampling the image intensity along a particular cross shore transect the runup curve aagaard and holm 1989 was then detected from the time stack black curves in fig 4e and f using image thresholding and manual correction maximum runup occasionally occurred outside of the field of view spline extrapolation was used to identify maximum runup in these instances each run contains a series of swash events affecting the deployed munitions with the number of events depending on the run duration measurements extracted from sensors and cameras consist of swash duration t s uprush velocity u u backwash velocity u b and horizontal runup r swash events n events were isolated based on local minima in the water depth time series parameters are then sought to represent the conditions contained within a run that may be associated with motion burial swash events for monochromatic waves were ensemble averaged after time normalizing data based on swash duration fig 5 averaging was calculated when data existed such that the certain portions of the time series were not biased over others the maximum value of each measurement type was then retained as a parameter of interest and used for relating to munitions response tables 3 and 4 maximum and minimum deviations from the average σ min and σ max observed among all runs are reported in table 5 averaged σ min and σ max are also shown table 5 ensemble averaging is less appropriate for irregular waves instead the maximum value of each parameter was recorded for the n swash events within a run then the average of the maxima was identified and retained as the parameter of interest histograms of maximum values with the average represented as a black line are reported in fig 6 selecting a smaller value 2 exceedance only alters maximally the chosen parameters by 5 84 and on average 1 62 retained parameters of interest for each run and for the swash zone are reported for experiment lwe1 table 3 and lwe2 table 4 the same approach was undertaken for breaker zone data but solely for water depths and near bed flow velocity named h and u in the breaker zone and obtained from the vector located at the cross shore position near the initial deployment location of breaker zone munitions the mobile beach evolved during the course of the conducted runs with elevations being measured occasionally for lwe1 and after each run for lwe2 fig 7 maximum elevation change magnitudes between successive profile measurements did not exceed 0 3 m and were on average 0 06 m the beach profiles evolved showing net erosion at the shoreline x 0 m and offshore with net accretion landward x 0 m 4 methodology 4 1 dimensionless parameters related to burial and migration two dimensionless numbers have been related to burial of pipelines or objects in a mobile bed the keulegan carpenter kc number and the shields parameter θ the keulegan carpenter number represents the ratio between drag and inertia forces as 1 k c u b t s d the shields parameter indicates the ratio between destabilizing and stabilizing forces for sediment mobilization 2 θ τ b ρ s ρ w g d 50 where ρ s and ρ w are sediment and water densities 2650 kg m3 and 1000 kg m3 respectively and g is the gravitational acceleration the bed shear stress τ b is expressed using a friction coefficient f equal to 0 03 puleo and holland 2001 3 τ b 1 2 ρ w f u b 2 incipient sediment motion is normally assumed to occur for θ 0 05 soulsby and whitehouse 1997 however munition presence on in the bed can lead to increased bed shear stresses truelsen et al 2005 the object mobility number has been related to the object distance traveled rennie 2017 and is defined as 4 θ m u 2 g d ρ m ρ w 1 the object mobility number is mostly used to study initiation of motion and identify the threshold for motion no motion a modified objected mobility number considering the initial burial depth b i may be more appropriate for this study 5 θ m m o d u 2 g d ρ m ρ w 1 d b i d the aim of the present study is to investigate relationships between kc θ θ m mod and other dimensionless numbers with burial and migration for the cases of no motion and motion respectively considering that the lwe experiments mostly occurred in the swash zone parameters such as the foreshore slope and the runup are also considered as potentially important the iribarren number ξ providing the ratio between the foreshore slope and the offshore wave steepness is 6 ξ t a n β h s l 0 t a n β 2 π h s g t p 2 where l 0 is the offshore wave length the iribarren number provides an indication of the type of beach either dissipative ξ 0 5 milder beach slope or reflective ξ 3 3 steeper beach slope dean and dalrymple 2001 4 2 munition migration temporal evolution derivation 4 2 1 munition migration from imagery munition tracking from imagery consists of locating munition x y positions in the rectified image the tracking may be accomplished automatically via image processing algorithms if the object is easily identifiable during the lwe studies multiple munitions were deployed at the same time and most of the motion occurred when the munition was difficult to identify automatically due to the presence of foam therefore munition positions nose and tail were identified manually multiple manual identifications 18 iterations of a particular fixed munition yielded horizontal variability errors of 0 05 m for x and 0 08 m for y essentially the same size as the grid spacing used for image rectification this error is assumed to be consistent for all manual identification munition position identification is not possible when the munition is fully submerged or completely covered by bubbles foam 4 2 2 munition migration in time from imu the imu can overcome some of the imagery limitations since data are recorded continuously a simple algorithm was developed to derive munition trajectories using imu measurements shown schematically in fig 8 a see also frank et al 2016 munitions of cylindrical shape were observed to move mostly due to rolling around x m thus the initial step was to quantify the cumulative angle of rotation ϕ time series around x m second the migration in the lwe reference system x y was determined through the imu heading measurement there are two imu measurements from which ϕ can be estimated the instantaneous orientation relative to x m ϕ roll and the angular velocity around x m ϕ gyro imu sign convention follows the right hand rule clockwise munition rotation around x m yields a positive roll and positive angular velocities cumulative rotation angle is obtained directly from roll simply summing cumulatively the roll time series and subtracting the initial roll differences between ϕ roll and ϕ gyro are discussed in section 6 the distance traveled by the rolling munition is quantified using the munition diameter as 7 s π d ϕ r o l l 360 where s represents the cumulative distance traveled through rotation around x m the combination of s with the time series of heading of x m is used to identify the cross shore and alongshore trajectory components the instantaneous yaw angle determines the angle between x m and magnetic north fig 8b angles a 1 and a 2 respectively indicating the angle difference between magnetic north and true north and true north and x fig 8b are used to alter yaw measurements and determine the munition heading time series γ note that γ ranges between 0 and 360 indicating the heading relative to the lwe horizontal plane on the contrary ϕ roll does not have a 360 limitation and the sign could be either positive or negative depending on the munition migration the steps involved to derive munition trajectory in x y using γ and s are repeated for each instant of time the trajectory d i from time t i 1 to t i is calculated from the distance traveled s i 1 to s i as 8 d i s i s i 1 the heading of x m in the horizontal plane at t i is provided by γ i green arrow in fig 8b depending on the sign of d i the munition rolled either clockwise positive roll positive d i blue arrow in fig 8b or counterclockwise negative roll negative d i red arrow in fig 8c with γ i being the heading relative to the cartesian axis γ i 90 and γ i 90 are the corresponding angles of the red and blue arrows the relative components of d i in x and y d x i and d y i are thus calculated as 9 d x i d i cos γ i 90 cos β 10 d y i d i sin γ i 90 equation 3 accounts for the angle β between the plane where the munition moves beach slope and the horizontal x coordinate the cumulative sum of d x i and d y i provides the time series of the components of motion in x and y respectively the initial munition position from rtk gps surveys or manual measurements is added to d x and d y that have initial values of zero 4 3 munition burial temporal evolution derivation apparent burial time series is estimated for surrogate 155 mm munitions that contained the photocell array each of the 12 photocell voltage time series was normalized by the highest voltage recorded by all 12 photocells during the run the photocell voltage after normalization varies between 0 no light received and 1 maximum light received deriving the amount of burial b defined as burial depth below the mean local bed level friedrichs et al 2016 from the photocell array data is possible if the orientation of the munition from the imu is known at each instant of time there are 24 possible initial orientations from the photocell standpoint considering that either one or two photocells can be oriented downward the 24 orientations are classified as α 15 2 where α 0 15 330 the angular separation distance between photocells the roll angle at time t determines the orientation at time t for instance photocells ph01 and ph02 are oriented downward when α 0 15 2 fig 9 a another example shows a single photocell ph11 oriented downward when α falls in the range 75 15 2 fig 9b note that temporal burial evolution is derived for cases of no motion only cutoff of 0 05 m for cross shore migration thus the change of orientation is relatively small and confined within less than one complete rotation ϕ roll 360 for cases where the imu malfunctioned 5 out of 67 initial munition orientation was determined by the photocell array signal the photocell with the minimum normalized voltage was identified as being oriented downward and thus has an error of 7 5 occasionally multiple photocells had the same minimum normalized voltage at time t 0 for such cases the photocell photocells located in the middle among the lowest voltage photocells was were set as oriented downward an algorithm was implemented to estimate the time history of local bed level relative to the cross section of the 155 mm a normalized threshold of 0 5 for the swash zone and 0 2 for the breaker zone was used to indicate burial or exposure where photocells with a normalized voltage lower than the threshold were considered buried different thresholds were needed in the swash and breaker zones due to water turbidity and depth for the breaker zone munitions light attenuation and the shallower water depth and intermittent exposure to air for the swash zone munitions often multiple photocells appear buried at a given time the arc of buried photocells is divided in half by a vertical line that passes through the circle center fig 9c the local bed level i e burial depth b is set as the same elevation of the highest buried photocells among the highest on the left phl in fig 9c and on the right phr in fig 9c finally b is normalized by the corresponding munition diameter d b d represents the dimensionless burial depth 5 results 5 1 cases tested hereafter each munition tested for a different run is referred to as a case where the total number of cases for swash and breaker zones differs two types of analysis on munitions behavior measurements are conducted for the swash zone one approach focused on pre to post run migration and burial with the aim to relate the response to the forcing conditions through empirical formulations section 5 2 the second approach focused on the time history of migration and burial sections 5 3 and 5 4 one to 10 munitions were deployed in the manner described in section 3 1 with initial orientations of 0 90 180 or 270 for reference system see fig 3b a total of 247 swash cases were accomplished during the two experiments 113 for lwe1 and 134 for lwe2 table 6 cases tested most predictive probabilistic models focus on cross shore migration as such the remainder of the paper will similarly address cross shore migration only there was a wide range of migration fig 10 depending on the beach and forcing conditions and the munition physical characteristics a large number of the munitions 62 had relatively little migration 1 0 m three 155 mm ld and one rkt migrated over 15 m offshore fig 10a a separation was needed to treat differently data of munitions that were mobilized from the ones that remained in place cases were split into two groups referred to as no motion and motion cases table 6 using a migration threshold of 0 05 m bold black line in fig 10b based on observations and the horizontal rtk gps accuracy of 0 02 0 03 m 5 1 1 breaker zone a different approach was undertaken for breaker zone munitions munitions were deployed at the beginning of each experiment simultaneously and only occasionally reset prior to a new run post run surveys of orientation position and burial exist for all cases of lwe2 but only 32 cases of lwe1 therefore the no motion versus motion separation for lwe1 was not undertaken table 6 for lwe2 the same threshold of 0 05 m adopted in the swash was used to separate the cases of motion in general mobility in the breaker zone was observed to be less than in the swash zone additionally the choice of leaving breaker zone munitions in place after each run does not allow an analysis of pre and post run burial and migration since each munition experienced the run starting from a different initial burial status 5 2 pre and post run analysis 5 2 1 burial and migration as a function of kc θ θm and θm mod relationships between burial depth observed from cases of no motion 98 and θ fig 12 a and kc fig 12b were investigated note that cases of different run conditions different munition types and different foreshore slopes are presented together inerts and surrogates are not segregated the color separation indicates the different experiments and thus the foreshore slope milder slope in red tones for lwe1 steeper slope in blue tones for lwe2 the color gradient provides a representation of munition density sixty four of the 98 cases occurred on the milder slope where less migration was observed the shields parameter ranged between 1 3 and 7 5 indicating the presence of sheet flow conditions nielsen 1993 and or bed fluidization kc ranged between 11 6 and 308 1 it appears the munition density played a role for lwe1 cases since denser munitions darker red markers showed greater b d with maximum relative burial of 2 past efforts cataño lopera et al 2007 demir and garcía 2007 friedrichs et al 2016 suggest a power law relationship for dimensionless burial of the form 11 b d a 1 θ b 1 where a 1 and b 1 are fitting coefficients typical values for a 1 b 1 are 1 2 0 33 0 97 0 33 13 1 and 1200 2 4 depending on d and munition shape for lab and field data of objects constantly submerged and in the presence of steady current and no waves friedrichs et al 2016 objects subjected to oscillatory flow or wave and or combined flow conditions yielded b 1 0 8 cataño lopera et al 2007 demir and garcía 2007 note the solid line in fig 12a representing equation 11 with b 1 0 85 was found for short cylinders in oscillatory flow cataño lopera et al 2007 however the shields number for the aforementioned studies was less than 1 the highest correlations with the swash zone data in the present study were for a 1 0 47 and b 1 0 29 but r 2 was only 0 05 previous research cataño lopera et al 2011 friedrichs et al 2016 sumer and fredsøe 2001 also suggest a relationship of the form 12 b d a 2 k c c 2 where a 2 and c 2 are fitting coefficients the two lines in fig 12b were identified for cylinders a 2 0 1 c 2 0 51 and frusta a 2 0 0077 c 2 0 78 for equilibrium burial of fully submerged objects subjected to wave forcing friedrichs et al 2016 similar coefficients were also found by sumer and fredsøe 2001 for fixed pipelines subjected to waves and currents and by cataño lopera et al 2011 for frusta in waves alone and combined flow swash zone observations fall between the two empirical relationships even though they are intermittently submerged and do not reach equilibrium burial coefficients a 2 0 09 and c 2 0 43 were found for the observed burial depths solid line in fig 12b with an r 2 of 0 39 using the object mobility number instead of shields number or kc yielded an r 2 of 0 32 a comparison between the relative burial achieved by the munition at the end of the run and the normalized beach profile changes δz d occurring within the run is shown to investigate the role of the morphodynamic changes in the munition burial process fig 12c the data are shown for no mobility munitions tested for the 1 10 slope beach profiles were not surveyed after every run for lwe1 slope 1 16 experiment the majority of the data had relative burial greater than 0 as most of the munitions were deployed with b i 0 δz 0 0 indicates accretion erosion had occurred the first quadrant in the figure δz 0 and positive burial indicates foreshore accretion and munition burial if the burial processes were governed solely by the beach morphology changes the data would exist along the 1 1 line accretion burial depth however the observations are mostly located above the 1 1 line suggesting that the munition burial on the foreshore is governed additionally by local scour processes when the foreshore eroded δz 0 munitions also experience burial further indicating the importance of local scour processes additional analyses were conducted for the motion group fig 13 with 100 cases for the steeper slope and 49 cases for the milder slope table 6 most of the mobility 69 was offshore directed positive d x with some onshore directed motion for a variety of munitions bulk density the largest offshore migration 15 20 m occurred for the 155 mm ld ρ m 2115 kg m3 fig 13 the lowest density munition tested on the milder sloping beach interestingly some 155 mm ld also migrated onshore yielding the three largest onshore directed migrations observed of 2 5 4 3 and 5 1 m θ 2 3 3 5 in contrast the similarly shaped 155 mm ρ m 4230 kg m3 had average offshore migration distances of only 0 1 m regardless of forcing or slope conditions there was an exception where one 155 mm migrated offshore 4 2 m under the most intense forcing conditions but another 155 mm deployed initially at the same cross shore position migrated only 0 14 m no 155 mm were observed to migrate onshore comparisons for migration were also made with the object mobility numbers the maximum object mobility number observed was 1 53 however the majority of the motion data had θ m 1 09 similarly for θ m mod there is no substantial difference between the relationships found for migration with θ m fig 13a and θ m mod fig 13b as most of the munitions were typically deployed proud initially the extra factor included in θ m mod that accounts for initial burial depth eq 5 varies between 0 100 initial burial or more and 1 0 initial burial under equal conditions a larger object mobility number should indicate a larger potential for the object to be mobilized note in fig 13b the data points in proximity of θ m mod between 0 and 0 2 with the mobility number reduced by the extra factor both plots indicate scatter but with denser munitions migrating shorter distances interestingly different d x were observed under the same mobility number i e same flow velocity for the same type of munition these cases were observed mostly for rkt and 81 mm with travel distances ranging from 1 6 to 7 8 m for θ m 0 89 and 0 07 4 1 m for θ m 0 4 respectively there are not enough burial cases for regular wave forcing conditions squares in fig 12 to make a comparison or differentiation between regular and irregular waves playing a role in burial response in addition there is no obvious differentiation in the migration data fig 13 in regular square symbols and irregular circles wave groups either the short wave bursts and the use of bulk quantities in the analysis might not provide a significant difference between wave spectra considered 5 2 2 burial and migration semi empirical formulation numerous potential parameters could be associated with munitions burial kc and θ already tested individually a nonlinear least squares regression of the form 13 b d a 3 θ b 3 k c c 3 was tested yielding a 3 0 06 b 3 0 24 and c 3 0 5 fig 14 a the r 2 value is 0 45 with a best fit slope and intercept of 0 94 and 0 046 respectively a similar coefficient c 3 was found previously for cylinders c 3 0 51 friedrichs et al 2016 and fixed pipelines c 3 0 50 sumer and fredsøe 2001 additional model tests of the form b d aq 1 b q 2 c q 3 d where q i indicates a different dimensionless quantity were tested a slight improvement is obtained incorporating the munition shape and the iribarren number 14 b d a 4 θ b 4 k c c 4 d l d ξ e the coefficients a 4 0 07 and c 4 0 49 are similar to a 3 and c 3 obtained for equation 13 while b 4 d and e are 0 35 0 14 and 0 12 respectively the squared correlation coefficient improves by only 0 03 fig 14b which must be weighed against the inclusion of three additional fitting coefficients removing ξ decreases the correlation by 0 01 with r 2 0 48 migration was also correlated with θ m and θ m mod a nonlinear least squares regression analysis was conducted similar to that for burial data and following the same form of equations 13 and 14 θ m and θ m mod alone cannot fully explain the migration processes the squared correlation coefficient found is nearly zero r 2 0 05 adding the ratio ρ m ρ w increases r 2 substantially r 2 0 27 confirming that density plays a fundamental role in migration processes the semi empirical formulation with the highest r 2 0 37 found is 15 d x a 5 θ m m o d b 5 ρ m ρ w c 5 ξ d 5 yielding a 5 25 65 b 5 0 75 c 5 2 59 and d 5 0 26 not shown other parameters such as runup foreshore slope alone not included in the iribarren number and the initial orientation of the munition were tested without significant improvement in correlation 5 3 migration time evolution 5 3 1 application of imu algorithm for migration and algorithm reliability application of the algorithm for run 58 and a 81 mm munition see table 4 for run conditions is shown in fig 15 as an example imu data are compared with data obtained using imagery time series are shown only for a window of 92 s until munition motion ceased the first two panels fig 15a and b contain imu measurements raw roll angle ranges from 180 to 180 fig 15a and oscillates with each wave indicative of munition rolling the instantaneous orientation of the munition fig 15b determined with the imu solid line follows the trend estimated from imagery circles the cumulative angle of rotation fig 15c is positive with a final value corresponding to nearly 14 rotations offshore finally the cross shore migration d x magenta matches well that derived from imagery filled circles fig 15d the background image is the corresponding time stack obtained from c1 while the black filled circle indicates the x coordinate of the munition surveyed by the rtk gps at the end of the run the munition of interest was deployed at the shoreline circled in fig 15e at t 1 with an initial orientation of 186 the munition remained fixed until roughly 50 s when it was impacted by the 4th wave of the run the orientation changed such that x m went from roughly perpendicular to roughly parallel to the shoreline from 186 to 98 an onshore migration of 0 3 m was followed by a 1 5 m offshore migration snapshots in fig 15e at t 2 and t 3 before the munition motion stopped circled in fig 15e at t 4 imaged derived and imu positions align until they diverge towards the end of this offshore motion with an offset of 0 46 m at 56 22 s a similar behavior of net offshore migration is evident for the next two waves after each swash event the munition stopped in a location more offshore than the previous during the 7th wave of the run the munition moved again with net offshore transport this time the motion was detected only from the imu and not from the imagery due to lack of visibility the imu heading measurement indicates a change of orientation from 98 to 17 and hence x m was again roughly perpendicular to the shoreline after t 5 the munition remained fixed as indicated by a constant imu x 1 73 m the angle differences between imu and image derived headings are generally less than 20 for this specific case the largest error between image derived and imu derived cross shore locations is 0 7 m migration was captured from c1 only towards the ends of backwash due to visibility issues post run cross shore munition position surveyed with the rtk gps yielded a difference of 0 19 m if compared with the imu derived position the munition when mobilized showed the same trend of motion for each swash event a small onshore movement followed by a larger offshore migration munition trajectories and post run positions derived from the imu are affected by error see section 6 the rtk gps and imagery were used to determine the magnitude of the imu error for swash zone and breaker zone munitions post run rtk gps surveys were compared with the post run locations derived from imu for cross shore fig 16 a and alongshore components fig 16b the least squares fit for cross shore alongshore migration has a slope of 0 69 0 8 and an intercept of 0 05 0 15 with a squared correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 62 r 2 of 0 51 a similar analysis was carried out to compare munition locations derived from the imu with those derived from imagery solely for swash zone cases cross shore fig 16c alongshore fig 16d larger error is estimated for cross shore motion r 2 of 0 49 if compared to the alongshore direction r 2 of 0 75 for the imu slopes and intercepts of least squares fits are 0 68 and 0 48 for cross shore and 0 85 and 0 97 for alongshore respectively 5 3 2 migration observations the developed imu algorithm was applied to all available cases for 155 mm 81 mm and rkt munitions deployed in the swash and breaker zones for both regions cases were separated into two categories based on the total migration no motion motion less than 0 05 m and motion motion greater than 0 05 m there were 31 cases for no motion and 40 cases for motion in the swash zone table 6 imu the corresponding numbers for the breaker zone munitions were 225 and 37 table 6 imu swash zone observations of cross shore migration are shown for the three munition types fig 17 only for cross shore migration and for cases of motion thirty two out of 40 cases of motion are associated with the steeper foreshore slope lwe2 blue curves the majority of the cases 34 out of 40 belong to rkt and 81 mm munitions the rkt and 81 mm of comparable length and diameter often migrated up to 4 m offshore with some exceptions up to 8 m in addition rkt and 81 mm often mimicked the runup curve rolling upslope during uprush and downslope during backwash with incremental net motion offshore the maximum offshore migration for the few cases of motion for the 155 mm munition 6 out of 40 was 4 m the 155 mm munitions did not mimic the rkt and 81 mm in terms of intra wave onshore and offshore motions and instead migrated more erratically with a net offshore motion migration does not appear to be correlated solely to the forcing θ as the largest traveled distances are not always related to the largest forcing the modified object mobility number ranges ascribed the three munitions were 0 52 0 98 for rkt 0 16 0 33 for 155 mm and 0 33 0 68 for 81 mm the largest migration distances for rkt 8 7 m 155 mm 3 9 m and 81 mm 8 2 m occurred for θ m mod of 0 75 0 24 and 0 40 respectively again showing inconsistent variability in migration distance as a function of the forcing breaker zone munition cases experienced less motion compared to the swash zone munition cases there are 37 cases of motion against 125 cases of no motion table 6 imu occurring for 81 mm and rkt munitions only trajectories for the 81 mm munition not shown are confined within an onshore migration of 1 m and an offshore migration of 0 5 m the corresponding values for the rkt were 1 m and 2 m respectively no dominance in motion direction onshore offshore was observed 5 4 burial time evolution results 5 4 1 application of photocells burial algorithm and algorithm reliability an example from run 52 from lwe2 illustrates the approach to identify apparent burial time history fig 18 the munition was deployed proud at the shoreline snapshot taken from uc fig 18g t 1 the munition rolled offshore less than a complete rotation during the first five swash events and became buried roughly half of its diameter panels a e are sub divided into three time windows corresponding to the beginning of the run 0 10 s the section where the munition rolled 20 120 s and the end of the run 310 330 s the first two panels fig 18a and b indicate the hydrodynamics showing water depth and cross shore flow velocities respectively water depths started with values of 0 26 m and decreased to 0 20 m at approximately t 3 velocity magnitudes reached maxima of 1 2 m s for the uprush and 1 6 m s for the backwash the initial ϕ roll was 109 8 indicating a munition orientation with ph08 and ph09 oriented downward ph09 and ph04 had normalized voltages of roughly 0 and 1 respectively fig 18c only five photocells out of 12 are shown for clarity these photocell values match the recorded initial deployment orientation no motion occurred prior 30 s at t 2 an offshore directed rotation of 23 9 from 109 8 to 133 7 fig 18d caused ph09 to point downward fig 18h t 2 the relative bed level was 0 27 fig 18e f and 18h and ph02 and ph04 had a normalized voltage of nearly 1 fig 18c between t 2 and t 3 the munition continued rolling offshore the rotation angle was 124 6 from 133 7 to 258 3 fig 18d leading to ph04 and ph06 being oriented downward fig 18h t 3 both ph04 and ph06 had a normalized voltage of 0 while ph09 and ph12 had a signal near 1 fig 18h normalized burial depth b d reached a maximum value of 0 55 fig 18e f and 18h after t 3 the munition rolled slightly more offshore with ph04 oriented downward fig 18h at t 4 and ph02 having normalized voltage less than 0 5 within the time window 120 310 s the munition remained fixed with no appreciable changes in burial the burial detected from the photocell array at the end of each run was compared least squares to the corresponding post run survey of burial status to estimate the errors in the developed algorithm fig 19 the best fit line is characterized by a slope of 0 88 an intercept of 0 04 and an r 2 of 0 73 however the judgement parameter manual burial measurements is affected by the discretized nature of collection described earlier an error of 25 6 discussion 6 1 migration data from a large scale laboratory study under near prototype forcing conditions showed initially proud munitions in medium sand in the swash zone and breaker zone can be mobilized migration data were captured using rtk gps equipment georeferenced imagery and inertial motion units inside some of the munitions munitions located in the swash zone generally mimicked the runup curve with a slight onshore migration followed by a more prolonged offshore migration fig 17 in addition munitions tend to migrate the most during the initial stages of forcing fig 17 migration slows or ceases when munitions enter deeper water and are offshore of bore collapse or when they are located landward beyond the extent where backwash forcing is capable of remobilization fig 17 the net migration of swash zone munitions was mostly offshore directed figs 13 and 17 with only 46 out of 149 cases 31 of net landward migration observed cross shore migration showed some relationship with munition density with the less dense munitions generally migrating farther offshore maximum distance of 20 m and the most dense munitions having small or no migration fig 13 no obvious relation was found between the distance traveled and the object mobility number or the modified object mobility number breaker zone munitions were not reset in between runs implying variable initial burial depths and all munitions tended to exhibit less migration munitions migrated maximally 3 4 m onshore and 3 6 m offshore with no preferential migration direction 58 cases migrated offshore 57 cases migrated onshore and 225 cases migrated less than 0 05 m fig 11 munition migration distances were variable under the same offshore forcing conditions same munitions placement and same munitions density indicating local small scale hydrodynamic and sediment transport processes are vitally important for predicting munitions processes the variability in swash zone migration could not be well described using empirical formulations related to offshore forcing namely the munition bulk density object mobility shields and iribarren numbers with squared correlation coefficients of only 0 37 maximally additional tests incorporating initial munition orientation and dimensionless runup were unsuccessful poor correlation between forcing and migration distance was not fully unexpected considering for example the variability in migration with object mobility number fig 17 larger object mobility number does not equate to larger migration distances the data obtained here show that swash zone munitions tend to migrate offshore the question arises as to how munitions are occasionally found on beaches one option is that munitions appear on the foreshore through erosion of dunes or the foreshore through the process of exhumation a second option is munitions are transported to the foreshore from a more offshore location indeed lwe data showed that some onshore migration can occur but there was no preferential direction of migration for breaker zone munitions and migration distances were small the latter possibly due to the short run durations however the lwe studies were limited by necessity in several ways that could be circumvented in the future 1 the water level was not altered during the study altered water levels tides would change the location of wave breaking forcing and could perhaps change munition migration patterns 2 the foreshore slopes for both studies were fairly steep 1 16 and 1 10 causing the downslope component of gravity to be a major driving force in munitions migration the lwe facility could not accommodate a much shallower sloping foreshore indicative of a dissipative beach a shallower sloping beach would de emphasize the downslope gravity component and perhaps enable more capability for net onshore migration especially with tidal variations 3 forcing conditions were near prototype for what might be identified as moderate forcing extreme event forcing could not be tested but would likely be able to force an additional component of onshore migration perhaps leading to net migration in that direction indeed analyses uxo mobility model indicated munitions initiated far offshore could experience net onshore transport and exposure under high energy waves and currents navfac 2013 but the ability to be stranded on the foreshore was not tested 4 all munitions tested were deployed initially proud except subsequent runs in the breaker zone when munitions were not reset yet migration is expected to be reduced when forcing acts upon partially buried munitions such that the conditions tested at lwe provided the best opportunity under the forcing used for munitions to experience a net onshore migration 6 2 burial burial observations at lwe were governed by both foreshore morphologic changes as well as local scour processes fig 12c burial data indicated again the importance of munitions bulk density with the denser munitions having a greater relative burial depth fig 12a b maximum burial b d 2 was observed for the 20 mm with a bulk density of 7990 kg m3 fluidization of the seabed may be one reason why b d reached values greater than 1 note that previous studies of object burial generally occurred under non sheet flow conditions friedrichs et al 2016 identified more than 600 cases of reported munitions like object burial by waves or waves currents in sand with more than the 95 for shields parameters less than 0 6 and none exceeding 2 in contrast the observations made at lwe in the swash zone are associated with greater shields numbers 1 3 7 5 the scour processes in sheet flow conditions and a fluidized bed may be different than those investigated by previous studies sheet flow conditions may enable dense objects to sink through the fluidized bed enhancing burial additional measurements and analysis would be required to further test this concept equilibrium scour burial under combined waves and currents has been related to dimensionless forcing parameters keulegan carpenter number and shields parameter with some success cataño lopera et al 2011 friedrichs et al 2016 sumer and fredsøe 2001 attempts using the parameters alone or in tandem provided moderate squared correlation coefficients with respect to relative burial depth r 2 0 45 and r 2 0 48 fig 14a thus only roughly 50 of the variability in relative burial depth can be explained by these simple relationships for non equilibrium burial depth 6 3 sensor capability 6 3 1 inertial motion unit munition trajectories and final positions inferred from a simple algorithm were similar with moderate correlation r 2 roughly 0 5 to those inferred from imagery and pre and post run rtk gps measurements moderate correlation might be expected considering the imu is a low cost sensor and trajectories are affected by compounding error and data processing issues the cumulative angle of rotation ϕ roll was derived directly from the roll angle measurements however ϕ can also be derived indirectly by integrating the angular velocity time series from the gyroscope comparisons were made between the two approaches in the gyroscope derived ϕ gyro approach a cutoff of 10 s was used to neglect angular velocity data assumed to be associated with sensor noise a cutoff is necessary because integrating small angular velocities an extended period of time when the munition is actually stationary can lead to large error in ϕ frank et al 2016 the error between ϕ roll and ϕ gyro was estimated for each case belonging to the motion group as 16 e r r o r 100 ϕ r o l l t e n d ϕ g y r o t e n d ϕ r o l l t e n d where t end refers to the end of the run the average error for the 71 swash and breaker zone cases when the gyroscope also collected data was 13 5 with an error range of 0 09 70 the roll angle was chosen for migration distance in this paper because roll and heading data are associated to the same time vector that differs from gyroscope time vector on the imu guaranteeing consistent data sampling and time synchronization the trajectory regardless of how the roll is quantified is found cumulatively thus any measurement error compounds over time other imu vendors caution against using imu data for position for long data records because the errors grow exponentially ch robotics the error is likely to be exacerbated using the gyroscope data because a double integration is required to obtain position 6 3 2 photocell array manual measurements of burial were made post run and using photocells on some 155 mm surrogate munitions r 2 0 73 apparent burial time histories were derived from array of photocells similar to optical or acoustical rings used around surrogate mines used in past efforts bradley et al 2007 traykovski et al 2007 normalized voltage thresholds of 0 5 were chosen for the swash zone and 0 2 for the breaker zone the difference in threshold was due to intermittent emergence of the swash zone munitions and continually submergence of the breaker zone munitions under opaque water several examples of dimensionless burial depth b d curves show a similar trend fig 20 swash zone munitions experienced a rapid increase of relative burial depth at initial stages of the run followed by an approximately constant b d for the remainder of the run the observed trend matches the burial temporal evolution of cylinders in oscillatory flow demir and garcía 2007 however the fairly constant normalized voltage for the majority of the run may also be attributed to light attenuation through the water causing the apparent burial of the munition normalized voltages decreased after wave forcing ceased causing the apparent burial to decrease however there is no physical mechanism without wave forcing that would exhume the munitions instead the decrease in burial depth implies photocells overestimate the actual burial depth during the run due to the difficulties in separating actual burial photocell covered by deposited sand from apparent burial photocell covered by turbid water thus the decrease in normalized voltage after wave forcing is attributed to sediment settling post run post wave activity some swash zone cases appeared to confirm apparent burial where for instance a 155 mm deployed initially proud b d 0 experienced 100 burial b d 1 confirmed by manual surveys grey curve in fig 20 the findings suggest the photocells are likely appropriate for identifying burial on longer time scales in more opaque water or in the swash zone and for shorter time scales in less opaque water 7 conclusions inert and sensor enabled surrogate munitions were tested in a large scale wave flume containing medium sand to identify migration and burial characteristics under near prototype wave forcing in bursts of 2 5 10 min munitions tested on two different steep foreshore slopes preferentially experienced a net offshore directed migration less dense munitions or remained relatively fixed in the horizontal and buried more dense munitions only 46 out of 149 swash zone cases 31 experienced a net onshore directed migration most of the swash zone munitions that migrated offshore began to bury once motion ceased there was no preferential direction for breaker zone munitions and migration distances were less than 3 6 m regardless of cross shore position denser munitions buried more deeply than less dense munitions the density threshold for initial migration vs burial was around 4000 kg m3 estimated from the limited number of munitions tested findings from the short wave bursts would indicate that munitions that exist on natural foreshores are likely to have been delivered there from farther landward during extreme events e g dune erosion or have already existed on the foreshore and been exhumed tests consisting of longer duration runs over shallower sloping beach profiles and or during extreme events are needed to determine if munitions can be readily transported from offshore to the foreshore empirical relationships between common dimensionless parameters such as the keulegan carpenter number shields parameter and object mobility number could only describe 50 of the observed variance in munitions burial and 37 of the observed migration some of the lack of skill is attributed to the short wave burst testing where munitions did not reach equilibrium burial or perhaps a final migration distance credit authorship contribution statement demetra cristaudo

21903,ship hulls and propellers suffer from both mechanical defects and marine growth which increase surface roughness and thus lead to significant power speed penalties a recent standard iso 19030 2016 aimed at establishing a transparent and accurate method to compare a vessel s performance to itself over time however the standard performance value percentage speed difference v diff is both vessel specific and sensitive to operation point most importantly vessel speed the current paper thus proposes a new performance indicator based on the concept of equivalent sand grain roughness height k s which would enable comparisons between vessels increased accuracy for comparison of a vessel to itself over time and calculation of penalties under operating conditions differing from past data e g slow steaming sand grain height k s is determined iteratively through modelling roughness penalties on propulsive power granville s similarity law scaling comparing modelled and measured penalties and stopping the iterative process at a given tolerance on power penalty this new performance indicator is applied to onboard collected data from a panamax tanker and two roll on roll off sister vessels yielding qualitative agreement with hull condition reported from diving inspections comparative advantages and limitations of k s are discussed in relation to the iso 19030 performance

used in estimating resistance penalties due to hull roughness on a specific vessel size and speed demirel et al 2019 however accurate predictions of propulsive power penalties from inspections and roughness profile measurements are still elusive especially for soft forms of marine growth murphy et al 2019 the recent iso 19030 2016 standard on hull and propeller performance paved the way for increased transparency in hull and propeller performance monitoring detailing requirements in terms of sensor accuracy sampling frequency reference power speed curves filtering and correction procedures this iso standard follows a physical model approach where the power speed curves for a vessel must be known for different loading conditions i e varying draft and trim and where wind resistance is corrected for also collected data is filtered before analysis using only data points associated with calm weather stable course and speed and deep unconfined and ice free waters iso 2016 however the standard deals with hull performance for a vessel compared to itself between different periods in time i e the change in performance from a reference period to that of an evaluation period the standard is therefore not intended for comparisons between vessels besides numerous measurement and modelling uncertainties involved in any comparison paereli and krapp 2017 one of the reasons for this limitation stems from the selection of a performance value the percentage speed difference v diff which is not only vessel dependent but also a direct function of the measured speed bertram 2017 1 v d i f f v m v p v p 100 where v m and v p are the measured and predicted speeds respectively v diff is thus defined relative to a predicted speed v p i e the speed that would be attained at a reference hull condition for a given vessel it is well known that the importance of hull roughness penalty relative to total propulsion powering typically decreases for increasing speed due to higher wave making resistance at higher speed schultz 2007 woods hole oceanografic institute 1952 thus speed dependency is expected for relative percentage penalties such as percentage speed difference v diff the aim of the current work is to propose a new performance indicator that would enable comparisons between vessels as well as calculations on power consumption under operational speed and loading conditions differing from originally recorded data the latter is of special interest when sudden changes in operating conditions are called for e g slow steaming for economic or environmental reasons psaraftis and kontovas 2013 a hydraulic roughness height which aims at representing the hull roughness that gives rise to a measured penalty would in principle fulfil such requirements a procedure to determine equivalent sand grain roughness height is currently described and applied to data from three vessels belonging to two different shipping segments one panamax product tanker which operates worldwide and two sister roro vessels roll on roll off cargo the latter on a short sea route advantages and limitations of different hull performance indicators are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 vessel details three vessels are currently studied with kind permission from two collaborating shipping companies vessels a b and c table 1 vessel a is a 75 000 tonne deadweight panamax product tanker operating worldwide vessels b and c are two sister roro vessels exclusively operating a short sea route in the north sea besides different routes vessel a differs from vessels b and c in terms of size hull form design speed activity maximum consecutive idle time and dry docking interval table 1 these distinct specifications provide contrasting conditions for deterioration in hull performance woods hole oceanografic institute 1952 thus in principle tanker a is more prone to marine fouling than roro s b and c since the tanker is slower 14 knots design speed for the tanker or 7 2 m s versus 22 5 knots for the roro or 11 6 m s less active 51 activity versus 65 with longer maximum continuous idle time 93 days versus only 12 14 days operates in both tropical and temperate waters i e high and low fouling versus temperate waters with relatively less fouling and has a longer dry docking interval 5 years versus only 2 3 years underwater hull coatings were initially of the same type for all three vessels i e biocidal tributyltin free tbt free self polishing coatings spc however in the last dry docking vessels b and c were both retrofitted with non biocidal coatings in the case of vessel b an abrasion resistant coating arc with no fouling control properties and in the case of vessel c a silicone foul release coating frc 2 2 monitored data onboard monitored data forms the basis for any hull performance analysis the primary variables are speed and delivered power whereas secondary variables such as environmental and loading conditions are used for filtering and correcting data to reference conditions for the current vessels available data is summarized in table 2 with a total sampling period spanning at least 3 5 years for each vessel according to standard iso 19030 2016 part 2 default method monitored variables table 2 should be auto logged at a sampling frequency of 0 07 hz i e every 15 s with a note referring that 10 min blocks of data can be useful for analysis excluded from this frequency requirements are loading conditions of draft and trim which should be monitored when altered in part 3 of the iso standard alternative methods use of lower sampling frequencies is allowed for provided that variables are collected at the same sampling rate iso 2016 the latter is the case for monitored data provided by two shipping companies with noon reports available for the tanker vessel a and 10 min averaged values for roro vessels b and c table 2 sensor manufacturer specifications could not be presently verified against iso 19030 2016 requirements on sensor accuracy plausibility checks were carried out using histograms and time series for all variables supplementary material figures s 1 s 5 this procedure led to the early detection of various issues with speed loggers on all vessels figure s 4 namely significant drift and bias towards following currents for vessel a figure s 4a unlikely high currents 15 knots and bias towards following currents for vessel b figure s 4b long silent gaps due to sensor or data collection failure on vessel c figure s 4c considering these issues speed over ground sog is used as a proxy for speed through water stw though introducing effects of sea currents iso 19030 2016 part 3 which leads to increased noise in performance values as well as some bias error these effects should however approximately average out over periods of time of a few months and a noisy sog is currently preferred in detriment of a stw signal that drifts on the same time scale as the signal of interest i e changes in hull and propeller performance iso 2016 still it should be noted that due to the nonlinear relation between power and speed even if the difference between sog and stw is approximately zero on a long time average a few months the propulsive power will be underestimated assuming a power to speed third order relation a variation in stw of 1 knot on a constant sog of 12 knots would mean a 8 3 symmetrical variation in speed causing an asymmetrical 23 27 variation in power in this simplified case power determined from a varying stw would be on average about 1 2 higher than power predicted from a constant sog regarding secondary variables vessels b and c had 10 min averaged auto logged data from onboard instrumentation whereas vessel a had daily average values manually input by the crew the latter included average wind speed and direction beaufort scale and quadrants and out of performance codes intended for data filtering in the context of charter party performance clauses out of performance codes enabled to identify data points associated with varying course proxy for rudder angle confined waters and navigation in ice finally while draft values for vessel a were taken before each voyage leg draft values for vessels b and c 10 min averages had to be filtered for an idle ship with sog 0 5 knots currently used as a criterion the later filtering is required since draft measurements relied on pressure readings which are significantly affected by hydrodynamic effects on hull pressure schmode et al 2019 additional parameters were available for vessels b and c including air temperature c which was used in calculating air density for wind resistance corrections iso 19030 2016 part 2 and hindcast significant wave height m which was used as an additional weather filter detailed below under section 2 4 2 3 external data the second essential dataset in any physical model based hull performance analysis consists of reference baselines for delivered power or reference power speed curves as well as hydrostatic tables such data should cover the speed and loading conditions corresponding to the actual operation of the vessels iso 2016 results from resistance and self propulsion tests were made available by shipping companies for both the tanker and the roro sister ships as reported by their contracted towing tanks in order to obtain reference curves for the smooth hull condition from here on referred to as smooth power speed curves all reference curves from the towing tank were corrected by subtracting townsin s roughness allowance with standard peak to valley roughness height of 150 μm as per widely adopted procedure for prediction of full scale performance from model tests ittc 2017 reference baselines for the roro ships vessels b and c covered draft trim and speed conditions respectively in ranges 5 60 7 65 m 1 2 to 1 5 m positive trim by stern i e bow up and 15 0 to 22 5 knots 7 7 11 6 m s with a resolution of 4 6 and 16 levels for each parameter respectively significantly coarser towing tank results were accessible for the tanker vessel a with self propulsion tests available only for one draft 12 20 m null trim even keel and speed in the range 12 00 17 00 knots with steps of 0 50 knots therefore for vessel a power speed curves for other conditions were derived using an approximate power prediction method holtrop and mennen 1982 which was calibrated using the single power speed curve available from the towing tank results are presented in fig 1 including the calibrated holtrop mennen method showing relatively good agreement after multiplication of predicted power by a correction factor of 0 83 this approach was deemed sufficiently accurate for the current demonstrative purpose finally diver reports were available for most in water cleaning events on vessel a and for in water cleaning performed also on vessel b these documents included reporting on observed type of fouling estimated height and percentage cover of fouling on different parts of the hull and description of paint condition descriptions were accompanied by photographs taken both before and after in water cleaning 2 4 percentage difference in speed vdiff raw data is filtered according to iso 19030 2016 except where noted in the text with non iso by removing data points with incomplete data except for loading condition and filtering out 1 data points with wind speed above 7 9 m s or above beaufort level 4 2 data points associated with significant shallow water effects i e depth 3 b t or depth 2 75 v 2 g whichever limit is larger where g is the gravitational acceleration and b t and v are the ship s breadth mean draft and speed in the case of vessel a data points with indication of shallow confined waters depth 20 m non iso 3 draft trim speed and delivered power values outside range of reference power speed curves except vessel a which is only filtered for power and speed non iso 4 rudder angle 5 and 10 min standard error 1 in case of vessel a coded remark on varying course and speed non iso 5 surface water temperature 2 c in case of vessel a coded remark on navigation in ice non iso an additional filter for excluding data points with significant wave height 1 m is applied on data from vessels b and c aiming at improved accuracy non iso indeed a low wind condition 7 9 m s is not sufficient for a low significant wave height as observed by plotting wave height against wind speed in figure s 6 where wave heights up to 3 m are observed at wind speed 7 9 m s after filtering the delivered power on vessels b and c is corrected for wind resistance iso 19030 2016 annex g using the longitudinal resistance coefficient values for a car carrier larsson and raven 2010 no wind correction was attempted on vessel a due to the coarser scale reported by the crew beaufort and quadrants non iso thus for vessel a reported daily average beaufort is only used in filtering for calm weather conditions calm weather beaufort 4 finally the percentage difference in speed v diff is determined using equation 1 where measured speed v m corresponds to sog due to drifting or otherwise unreliable stw measurements figure s 4 the predicted speed v p is obtained from power speed curves either by interpolating power speed curves using corrected power and measured draft and trim spline interpolation vessels b and c or by creating an approximate power speed curve based on the holtrop mennen method with measured draft and trim and then interpolating based on delivered power vessel a non iso to be specific it should be noted that v diff is not a performance indicator on its own but only a performance value in iso 19030 2016 an indicator is defined as the change in average performance values i e the change between average percentage speed difference v diff in the evaluation period e g after a drydocking and average v diff in a reference period e g before drydocking thus by using a change in v diff as an indicator the iso standard avoids any interpretation of v diff in absolute terms 2 5 equivalent sand grain roughness height ks for the newly proposed performance indicator which is intended to be used as an absolute measure of hull and propeller performance the same initial filtering and correction procedures is applied as in the iso 19030 2016 approach except where noted above however instead of calculating percentage speed difference power speed curves are interpolated for determining differences in propulsive power 2 p d i f f p m p p p p 100 δ p p p 100 where the measured power p m corrected for wind resistance is compared against the predicted power p p the latter p p is obtained from interpolation of the smooth power speed curves using measured speed v m the δ p value in equation 2 i e the difference between measured power p m and predicted power p p is then used for determining an equivalent sand grain roughness height k s representing the sand grain hull roughness height that would result in δ p according to the procedure summarized in fig 2 and detailed below it should be noted that hull and propeller performance is still aggregated into a single indicator so the ship is currently modelled as a uniformly rough hull with a smooth propeller in order to separate hull and propeller performance both shaft torque and thrust measurements would be required which is not yet included in the standard procedure iso 2016 the concept of an equivalent sand roughness has been frequently applied as a common currency between disparate roughness types or roughness textures bradshaw 2000 schlichting 1979 schultz et al 2015 at roughness scales relevant for large marine vessels it is generally accepted that the hydrodynamic effect of most types of roughness on the boundary layer is represented by a downward shift in the logarithmic overlap layer or roughness function δ u this roughness function assumes a linear asymptote as a function of the logarithm of the roughness reynolds number k k u τ ν where k is an arbitrary roughness height u τ is the friction velocity and ν is the fluid s kinematic viscosity provided that k is high enough flack and schultz 2014 this high k regime is denominated fully rough regime and δ u data for all types of roughness can thus be collapsed by replacing the arbitrary roughness height k by the equivalent sand grain roughness height k s the latter must be obtained experimentally flack and schultz 2010 sand grain roughness height is therefore an hydraulic roughness height which serves as a common currency between disparate types of roughness bradshaw 2000 and enables modelling of ship resistance penalties demirel et al 2017 schultz 2007 even though the roughness function δ u collapses for all types of roughness at high enough k s fully rough regime different types of roughness may have different roughness functions δ u at intermediate ranges of k s i e in the transitionally rough regime a suitable roughness function must thus be specified in order to model roughness penalties for a specific roughness type for marine fouling and hull coatings the roughness function described in demirel et al 2017 is currently adopted which is based on experimental data selected by schultz 2007 3 δ u 0 k s 3 1 κ ln 0 26 k s s i n π 2 log k s 3 log 5 3 k s 15 1 κ ln 0 26 k s k s 15 having defined the roughness function δ u f k s the equivalent sand grain roughness height may be used in modelling resistance penalties due to hull roughness at the ship scale either by using wall functions in a computational fluid dynamics cfd approach or by using flat plate granville s similarity law scaling shortened here as granville method demirel et al 2017 schultz 2007 fig 2 illustrates the proposed procedure for deriving the performance indicator k s from vessel data first both monitored and external data are combined for determining the difference in propulsive power due to hull and propeller roughness δ p at a given time t an initial guess for equivalent sand grain roughness k s 0 is provided as an input to the function find k s from which the first value for resistance penalty δ r 0 is determined using a suitable scaling procedure e g granville method and taking into account both vessel speed and loading condition at time t for determining δ r the granville method is selected which typically runs in 0 1 s on a laptop computer in detriment of a prohibitively computation expensive cfd approach demirel et al 2017 the granville method is implemented as described in schultz 2007 where roughness effects on ship scale resistance are modelled as on a flat plate with same length and wetted surface area as the hull function of loading conditions and travelling at measured speed v m implementation of granville method has been verified against previous results figure s 7 the obtained δ r is then converted to an increase in propulsive power by taking vessel speed v m and propulsive efficiency η d into account 4 δ p i r r o u g h v m η d r o u g h r s m o o t h v m η d s m o o t h δ r v m η d where propulsive efficiency η d is assumed to be unaffected by hull roughness i e η d r o u g h η d s m o o t h η d due to cancelling effects of decreased open water propeller efficiency and increased hull efficiency svensen 1983 pp 49 61 the latter approximation has also been confirmed for the kriso containership where a cfd study on the self propelled full scale vessel showed less than 1 variation in η d with increasing hull roughness provided that the propeller is smooth song et al 2020 values for η d are thus obtained directly from self propulsion tests conducted in towing tanks for the reference hull condition at speed v m any propeller roughness effects on η d are included as an equivalent effect on δ r following a smooth propeller approach should onboard thrust measurements become available in the future propeller modelling would be attempted to include propeller roughness effects on η d finally calculated δ p i values are compared to the absolute value of δ p t on each iteration fig 2 first decision node and k s i re estimated iteratively until a given tolerance on δ p is reached currently a tolerance of 1 on δ p is used the above iterative procedure is implemented in matlab version r2017b mathworks natick ma usa with a total of 10 iterations required for a tolerance of 1 on δ p fig 2 first decision node or a computation time of about 1 s per data point on a laptop computer further the procedure allows for future implementation of parallel computing thus reducing wall clock computation time a limitation of the above procedure consists in it being unable to represent negative δ p values i e a reduction in drag relative to the smooth reference power speed curve arising from scatter in the data bias of the data and or errors in obtaining the power speed baseline for avoiding such negative δ p values instead of calculating k s for every filtered data point only the median values of p diff for 3 month time blocks are currently used three months is the recommended minimum time interval for maintenance triggers and for evaluating maintenance effects iso 2016 the obtained k s values are thus calculated for specific points in time yet representing the median p diff value or in case of an even number of data points the two values closest to the median which is less sensitive to outliers than a simple time average of p diff further the median p diff value or two values closest to the median is associated with specific loading and speed conditions as required for calculating k s fig 2 which would not be the case for a time averaged p diff since both loading and speed conditions vary within the 3 month period for comparison purposes k s values tabulated in previous studies are used schultz 2007 as well as referring to hull fouling conditions reported by divers for the latter comparison diver estimations of physical height k t and percentage cover of hard fouling barnacles and tubeworms are converted into hydraulic roughness height using schultz 2004 5 k 0 059 k t c o v e r 1 2 where k must be further divided by a factor of 0 26 in order to obtain equivalent sand grain roughness for collapsing the fully rough asymptote used by schultz 2004 6 δ u 1 κ ln 1 k k 1 κ ln k to the fully rough asymptote for sand grain roughness in equation 3 k s 15 2 6 statistical analysis in order to evaluate the correlation between performance values and measured speed non parametric kendall s rank correlation coefficient τ k is used a value of 1 indicates reverse ranking for two given variables i e if one variable increases monotonically the second variable decreases monotonically 1 indicates the same ranking i e both variables increase monotonically and a value of 0 indicates no relationship between variables matlab version r2017b mathworks natick ma usa additionally p values are calculated for each τ k value where a p value 0 05 means significant correlation at a 95 confidence level for determining statistical significance of changes in v diff and p diff confidence intervals are calculated at a 95 confidence level by multiplying the standard error within 3 month time intervals by two tailed t student value with n 1 degrees of freedom where n is the number of observations montgomery 2013 the sparsity in calculated k s values did not currently allow for determining statistical significance within 3 month periods 3 results and discussion 3 1 power speed charts power speed charts are presented in fig 3 for unfiltered data together with selected smooth reference curves for one loading condition generally it is observed that most measured points do not seem to follow the shape of reference curves particularly for vessel a data points seem to approximately follow three discretized levels of delivered power with widely varying measured speed fig 3a for vessels b and c some shape can be recognized which approximately follows parallel to the reference curve even though data points are observed which show an apparently higher slope fig 3b c additionally for vessel b some points are observed very close to the x axis in a combination of high cruising speed with low delivered power falling far below the reference curve fig 3b upon investigation these latter points were attributed to a period when the shaft torque sensor was out of service thence the extremely low power values finally power speed data presented in these charts includes all environmental and operational factors that affect propulsive power which makes it impossible to evaluate each factor separately without any type of filtering or correction munk et al 2009 filtered power speed data are presented in fig 4 where effects from environmental conditions have been filtered and or corrected for except sea currents using sog as measured speed predicted power values are also represented red dots which were derived from reference curves using vessel loading condition and measured speed thus each measured data point black dots has its equivalent predicted power based on measured speed red dots it is noted that a significant amount of data was filtered out fig 4 compared to fig 3 more specifically 80 and 95 of the data were excluded by filtering for vessels a and b c respectively faced with such a high percentage of excluded data it could be argued that there is a large potential for obtaining denser information on hull and propeller performance in the future provided that environmental factors can be accurately accounted for e g by developing corrections for added resistance in waves and corrections for shallow water effects compared to power speed charts in fig 3 filtered and corrected data in fig 4 is observed to follow more closely the reference points except for vessel a for the latter vessel delivered power is mostly contained within a band located at 5 7 mw and does not show any apparent slope for a wide range of speeds 10 14 knots fig 4a such lack of match between measured and reference points seems to already suggest a widely varying hull and propeller performance this performance will be next analysed in further detail using time series for performance values indicator 3 2 performance values and indicator time series for performance values indicator are presented in figs 5 7 respectively for difference in speed v diff difference in power p diff and equivalent sand roughness k s 3 2 1 percentage difference in speed from comparison between measured and predicted speed equation 1 time series for difference in speed v diff are plotted in fig 5 along with time series for measured speed v m knots confidence intervals for v diff are presented in table 3 for periods of 3 months before after each maintenance event results not shown for in water cleaning on vessel a since the high frequency of the cleanings would result in extensive overlapping of comparison intervals for vessel a fig 5a the speed difference performance value is initially close to zero and starts to deviate considerably towards negative values after the second in water cleaning event second vertical dashed line with around 20 speed loss before the third cleaning event from then on the time series resembles a saw shaped function with higher speed penalties typically coinciding with the period before a cleaning event or dry docking vertical dashed and solid lines respectively these trends agree with expected deteriorating hull condition during each maintenance interval the dry docking on vessel a decreased the speed penalty significantly from 9 16 to 1 4 penalty table 3 vessel a dd1 95 confidence intervals for v diff a pattern resembling the saw shaped function of v diff is also noted in the measured speed v m time series fig 5a suggesting a correlation between the two variables indeed when v diff is plotted against v m fig 8 a only the data points associated with calculated 3 month p diff medians are shown a significant correlation is found with a kendall s rank correlation coefficient τ k of 0 562 p value 2 10 5 0 05 i e significant correlation care should be taken in interpreting this correlation since it is not clear how much of this is caused by 1 the very definition of v diff equation 1 from which 100 correlation would be expected between v diff and v m at constant delivered power and loading condition i e constant slope 1 v p in equation 1 or 2 speed dependent roughness penalties due to varying importance of these penalties at different speeds due to increasing wave making resistance with increasing speed additionally any inaccuracies due to use of the approximate holtrop mennen method for extrapolating towing tank results fig 1 may have had an impact on speed dependencies of v diff though this is considered negligible when data points are directly compared to towing tank results at a delivered power of 6 mw towing tank data gives a predicted speed of 13 knots fig 1 black dots whereas filtered results exhibit speeds as low as 10 11 knots at 6 mw fig 4a this direct comparison corroborates significant hull and propeller penalties 2 3 knots speed loss considering that towing tank data represents a laden vessel draft t 12 20 m i e low speed for a given propulsion power regarding speed penalties for vessels b c fig 5b c data points are significantly denser in time than for vessel a as expected from a higher sampling frequency 10 min frequency versus noon reports results still show a high level of noise at times exceeding 10 percentage points fig 5b c which is approximately at the same level as noise observed for vessel a fig 5a for both vessels b and c a downward trend in v diff i e an increasing penalty seems to occur in the interval between first and second dry docking vertical solid lines which is confirmed by non overlapping confidence intervals between 3 months after the first dry docking table 3 dd1 after and 3 months before the second dry dockings table 3 dd2 before for vessels b and c no significant correlation is found between v diff and v m fig 8b c with τ k ranging 0 021 to 0 205 p value 0 92 and 0 23 0 05 respectively i e no significant relationship to a large extent a lower correlation for these vessels is probably due to a wider range of delivered power fig 4b c resulting in a widely varying slope 1 v p in equation 1 as opposed to a fairly constant power for vessel a fig 4a 3 2 2 percentage difference in power as an alternative to speed penalty fig 5 percentage power penalties p diff are plotted in fig 6 the latter are obtained by comparing measured powered p m corrected for wind resistance to the predicted power p p obtained from reference curves interpolated for operational conditions i e vessel loading draft and trim and speed v m as in speed penalty results there is a clear saw shape trend in p diff for vessel a with drop in p diff coinciding with maintenance events especially on the 3rd 5th and 7th in water cleanings and finally on dry docking fig 6a the latter dry docking dd1 is associated with a significant drop in power penalty with non overlapping confidence intervals for the 3 month averaged p diff table 3 vessel a dd1 median p diff on each 3 month block are plotted as red circles in fig 6 and it should be noted that given the short intervals between cleaning events on vessel a these 3 month blocks may overlap in time e g between the 3rd and the 4th cleaning for both vessels b and c a slight slope is again detected between the two dry dockings and a significant improvement in performance immediately after each dry docking fig 6b c with non overlapping confidence intervals for 3 month time averaged p diff table 3 vessels b c dd1 and dd2 the level of correlation between p diff and speed v m is significant for vessel a fig 8a τ k 0 525 with p value 6 10 5 0 05 but non significant for vessels b and c τ k 0 088 and 0 095 for vessels b and c respectively with p value 0 6 0 05 i e no significant relationship between variables for vessel a the level of correlation is lower compared to that of v diff versus v m and there is now a reverse relationship i e p diff decreases with increasing speed v m fig 8a vessel a significantly negative τ k of 0 525 such negative dependency is expected since wave making resistance increases with speed and wave making resistance is typically assumed to be unaffected by hull roughness schultz 2007 woods hole oceanografic institute 1952 a lower correlation for p diff versus v m as compared to v diff versus v m may be due to removal of the direct dependency on v m as implied by the definition of v diff equation 1 finally considering the noise in the results i e at least 50 percentage point amplitude oscillations in p diff fig 6 it is not surprising that some data points lie below the reference curve on the power speed charts fig 4 resulting in some share of negative power difference values fig 6 these negative results would mean a lower drag for the in service condition compared to the reference which is currently attributed to inaccuracies in both monitored and external data on the one hand sensor or sampling inaccuracies and on the other hand physical modelling errors in obtaining or interpolating smooth reference power speed curves baselines regarding the latter reference curves which are currently based on model tests performed in towing tanks these have been corrected down to a smooth condition by removing an estimated hull roughness allowance however it could not be confirmed whether the towing tanks used the same formula townsin s formula or the standard peak to valley height of 150 μm as per recommended procedure ittc 2017 indeed available towing tank reports included only the aggregate model to ship correlation allowance coefficients which include also other resistance components thus it is plausible that the reference curves supposedly valid for a smooth hull condition might still contain some roughness allowance which would in part explain a negative p diff 3 2 3 equivalent sand grain roughness height results using the newly proposed performance indicator the equivalent sand grain roughness height k s fig 2 are presented in time series in fig 7 which are based on δ p values associated with median p diff values in 3 month time blocks the same time block size of three months is used in all comparisons as this is the recommended minimum for evaluating maintenance effects as well as maintenance triggers iso 2016 previously observed trends in time series for p diff fig 6 are again noted in the time series for k s including a saw shaped function for vessel a and an apparent increase in modelled roughness for vessels b and c in the interval between the two dry dockings fig 7 in the case of vessel a it is now possible to compare peak k s values before each cleaning with estimated values based on diver reports fig 7a markers qualitative agreement is achieved where considerably high roughness is detected before cleaning events with some overestimation in the case of diver reports it should be noted here that the estimates for hard fouling height and percentage cover from diver reports as used in equation 5 are associated with admittedly high uncertainty depending on diver s experience and methods used for estimating fouling size and percentage cover special reserve must be exercised regarding the third cleaning report fig 7a k s 20 cm which described extremely large barnacles 10 cm in height with associated uncertainties probably in the centimetre range also equation 5 was derived by schultz 2004 using drag results for considerably smaller barnacles 5 7 mm possibly rendering the current extrapolation inaccurate in regard to the actual hydrodynamic effect of larger barnacles 10 100 mm in height overall and according to tabulated values provided by schultz 2007 hull condition on vessel a fig 7a varied between a deteriorated hull coating or light slime after each in water cleaning i e k s 100 μm and medium heavy calcareous fouling before each cleaning event i e k s 3000 μm the latter agrees with the heavily fouled condition reported by divers before in water cleanings with k s values based on diver reports mostly in the 10 000 μm order of magnitude fig 7a markers within 30 days from modelled k s values red circles and a deteriorated coating detected after each cleaning please refer to supplementary figure s 8 finally dry docking of vessel a at t 1550 days had a significant effect on equivalent roughness with an almost two orders of magnitude decrease in three month average k s from 2100 μm before dry docking dd1 to only 60 μm on out docking table 3 vessel a dd1 these values correspond to a decrease from small medium calcareous fouling before dd1 to a typical as applied or deteriorated coating on out docking schultz 2007 on the first dry docking dd1 both vessels b and c register a significant improvement in performance table 3 and fig 7b c corresponding to a drop from k s 80 130 μm deteriorated coating or light slime down to k s 60 70 μm after dd1 which is still rougher than a typically as applied af coating k s 30 μm schultz 2007 for the same vessels b and c performance deteriorated significantly in the interval between dry dockings dd1 and dd2 when a biocidal spc hull coating was in use such deterioration is observed in fig 7b c as an apparent increase in k s from below 100 μm after the first dry docking to above or close to 100 μm i e a deteriorated coating or light slime schultz 2007 before the second dry docking see also table 3 vessels b c dd1 after and dd2 before which is backed by a statistically significant change in three month average v diff and p diff table 3 these roughness values are about an order of magnitude lower than peak values observed on vessel a table 3 reflecting the more challenging conditions faced by vessel a in terms of fouling prevention most notably vessel a s long idle periods up to 90 days calling ports in high fouling areas worldwide table 1 regarding the second dry docking dd2 k s decreases for vessel b when the hull coating was retrofitted to a non biocidal abrasion resistant coating arc in table 3 for vessel b k s 130 μm before dd2 to k s 50 μm after dd2 however the first in water hull cleaning after coating application performed at around eight months after dd2 does not seem to have affected k s fig 7b and table 3 vessel b hc1 such abrasion resistant coatings typically require frequent in water hull cleanings since these coatings do not exhibit any properties against fouling van rompay 2013 the diver report for this cleaning event indicates that cleaning was only performed on the vertical sides which presented slime 90 cover and short weed 20 mm in length 10 cover with no hard fouling present and a foul free flat bottom these observations agree with k s results which correspond to k s 100 μm around this in water cleaning event fig 7b equivalent to a deteriorated coating or light slime schultz 2007 a significant improvement in hull and propeller performance is also detected for vessel c on the second dry docking dd2 on which a non biocidal foul release product frc was applied thus for vessel c k s 100 μm before dd2 dropped significantly to k s 30 μm after dd2 table 3 vessel c a null time averaged p diff value was achieved in the last three months of data table 3 vessel c which would mean an hydraulically smooth hull null or even negative power penalties may be due to inaccuracies in either or both measured and or reference data namely a wrongly assumed hull roughness allowance used in correcting towing tank data to smooth power speed curves section 2 3 nevertheless compared to the previous dry docking table 3 vessel c dd1 these results suggest superior drag performance for frc compared to spc which is in line with previous laboratory testing on both coating types candries et al 2003 compared to the correlation between v diff and measured speed v m τ k of 0 562 for vessel a a slightly lower correlation in absolute value could be achieved between k s and v m with τ k of 0 547 for vessel a fig 8 which is nevertheless statistically significant p value 3 10 5 0 05 and higher than for p diff for vessels b and c correlations between k s and v m remained non significant fig 8b c k s versus v m with p value 0 05 equivalent sand roughness k s presents thus similar dependency on vessel speed as the standard speed loss iso 2016 with most of the high k s values observed towards the lowest speed fig 8a considering that speed is theoretically corrected for in calculating k s the remaining relation between k s and speed v m is probably due to modelling errors and sampling bias according to the latter hypothesis of sampling bias lower speed slow steaming is accepted whenever the vessel is significantly fouled this reciprocal dependency i e a dependency of vessel speed on hull condition could arise from engine performance optimization suggested by an approximately constant propulsive power at 5000 7000 kw fig 4a which is well below the maximum continuous rating of 13 560 kw table 1 therefore the above testing with kendall s coefficient is inconclusive since the cause of the correlation between roughness and measured speed cannot be ascertained finally one may ask just how much speed dependency can be expected on percentage power penalty p diff for a certain hull condition as caused by increasing wave making component with speed this question is better answered by modelling power penalties for a set of hull conditions as presented in fig 9 where power speed curves are given for vessels a and b c fig 9a together with their respective p diff values in fig 9b first of all it is noted that p diff increases or decreases with speed depending on where on the power speed curve one looks thus for vessel a the expected negative dependency on speed is only observed at sufficiently high speed above 15 knots i e when wave making resistance increases more rapidly fig 9a vessel a start of a hump on the power speed curve for the smooth hull for v 15 knots however since the current operational speed is below 15 knots figs 3 and 4 the expected dependency should actually be reversed i e an increase in p diff with increasing speed fig 9b vessel a for v 15 knots due to an increasing effect of roughness on the boundary layer flow this increase in p diff with speed is contrary to the trend observed in fig 8a decreasing p diff with increasing speed which further supports that the speed dependency observed in fig 8a is most probably due to sampling bias i e foul hull conditions are mostly sampled at low speeds in other words dependencies observed in fig 8a seem to arise mostly from a dependency of operational speed on rough hull penalties rather than the other way around further for vessel b c since the hump in power speed curves due to wave making resistance fig 9a vessels b c is not as strong as for vessel a fig 9a vessel a the speed dependency of p diff is also less strong at higher speeds fig 9b vessels b c which agrees well with the low correlation found for vessels b and c fig 8b and c 3 3 towards comparison between vessels from results presented in the previous subsections it is clear that calculated equivalent sand grain k s is subject to the same measurement and reference curve uncertainties as the iso 19030 performance value v diff adding to these uncertainties k s includes further modelling and numerical errors introduced in the iterative procedure of fig 2 therefore considering that trends in hull and propeller performance are already detected in the time series for v diff or p diff why should additional effort be invested in calculating a hydraulic roughness a meaningful comparison between vessels using an absolute measure of hull and propeller performance is the ultimate goal of performance analysis paereli and krapp 2017 in the newly proposed approach of calculating k s the effects of vessel speed and loading condition on the share of hull roughness penalty can be eliminated in so far as these effects are accurately represented on the contrary v diff and p diff are still specific for each vessel and operating point as further demonstrated in this section in fig 10 performance values v diff and p diff are plotted against k s for the current three vessels results from previous studies are also included for reference and comparison where the granville method was applied to other vessel types demirel et al 2017 schultz 2007 since the current implementation of the granville method was verified against previous results figure s 7 any scatter observed in fig 10 should reflect dependencies of v diff or p diff in regard to vessel type and operating conditions loading and speed from fig 10a at a modelled k s of 1000 μm which represents small calcareous fouling or weed schultz 2007 v diff corresponds to 6 for the us navy frigate and up to 11 for the current tanker vessel a at such roughness height this corresponds to a variation in v diff of 5 percentage points between vessels alternatively by comparing p diff results at the same k s of 1000 μm a maximum variation of up to 30 percentage points is noted between the us navy frigate at high speed fig 10b 30 power penalty and the kriso containership at low speed fig 10b 60 power penalty the curves diverge for increasing k s fig 10 demonstrating the potentially large impact of both hull type and operating conditions on both v diff and p diff this divergence limits the direct comparison between vessels using percentage penalties which might be of relevance e g in comparing quality of surface preparation and coating application between different shipyards working on different vessel types e g a naval shipyard compared to a large merchant vessel shipyard most alarmingly variability is also noted when comparing a vessel to itself which undermines the very aim of the iso 19030 2016 standard these variations are due to changing operational speed and loading conditions for example at a k s of 1000 μm small calcareous fouling or weed percentage power penalty p diff fig 10b increases 9 10 percentage points with decreasing vessel speed on each of us navy frigate schultz 2007 and kriso containership demirel et al 2017 therefore for vessels with significant variation in operational speed and loading conditions the impact of operating point on performance values v diff and p diff cannot be neglected potentially introducing a significant level of uncertainty in comparing a vessel to itself over time an approach that aims at correcting for the above issues is therefore justified namely by modelling the roughness effects for each specific vessel as currently proposed in order to compare the performance of different vessels whether the discussed uncertainty in v diff or p diff is higher than modelling and numerical errors introduced in estimating k s will surely depend on how widely the compared vessels differ in terms of vessel particulars as well as on their operational profile regarding uncertainties in k s modelling these remain to be quantified experimentally e g through full scale trials on vessels with fully characterized surface roughness for which k s must be known however provided that the same modelling procedure is used a comparison between vessels would still remain valid as long as modelling errors are kept constant additionally convergence errors in the find k s function fig 2 can be further minimized by decreasing the tolerance on δ p currently set at 1 tolerance finally provided that inaccuracies in monitored data and physical modelling are further quantified and minimized in particular the challenge of accurately measuring speed through water figure s 4 the equivalent roughness height k s is a promising candidate as an absolute indicator for hull and propeller performance such indicator would be utilized in comparing the hull and propeller condition between different vessels as well as comparing a vessel s performance to itself over time with improved accuracy additionally k s may be used in calculating vessel performance under operating conditions that may differ significantly from available monitored data e g when switching to from slow steaming 4 conclusions a transparent method for comparing hull and propeller performance of a vessel to itself over time was recently released under standard iso 19030 2016 however the standard performance value i e percentage speed difference is not only vessel specific but also sensitive to speed and vessel loading conditions aiming at an absolute indicator for hull and propeller performance the present study utilizes the concept of equivalent sand grain roughness height k s by iteratively modelling power penalties application of the novel indicator on three studied vessels resulted in qualitative agreement with hull condition reported by divers however though k s would in principle be independent from speed there is still a correlation between k s and measured speed for one of the vessels vessel a this correlation is currently attributed to sampling bias in the data further research is required to minimize measurement errors in monitored data separate propeller performance through onboard thrust measurements and refined propeller modelling and to quantify and minimize modelling errors namely those in the reference power speed draft trim data obtained from model scale resistance tests self propulsion tests and model to ship correlation coefficients an accurately determined hydraulic roughness height or otherwise normalized performance value would enable comparisons between vessels as well as improved accuracy in comparing a vessel s performance to itself over time such comparisons are paramount in evaluating the effectiveness of any energy saving measures on ship hulls and propellers credit authorship contribution statement dinis

21903,ship hulls and propellers suffer from both mechanical defects and marine growth which increase surface roughness and thus lead to significant power speed penalties a recent standard iso 19030 2016 aimed at establishing a transparent and accurate method to compare a vessel s performance to itself over time however the standard performance value percentage speed difference v diff is both vessel specific and sensitive to operation point most importantly vessel speed the current paper thus proposes a new performance indicator based on the concept of equivalent sand grain roughness height k s which would enable comparisons between vessels increased accuracy for comparison of a vessel to itself over time and calculation of penalties under operating conditions differing from past data e g slow steaming sand grain height k s is determined iteratively through modelling roughness penalties on propulsive power granville s similarity law scaling comparing modelled and measured penalties and stopping the iterative process at a given tolerance on power penalty this new performance indicator is applied to onboard collected data from a panamax tanker and two roll on roll off sister vessels yielding qualitative agreement with hull condition reported from diving inspections comparative advantages and limitations of k s are discussed in relation to the iso 19030 performance value keywords hull roughness hull biofouling energy efficiency iso 19030 fouling control coatings in water hull cleaning 1 introduction transporting around 90 of the world s trade ics 2017 international shipping is responsible for a share of anthropogenic emissions to the atmosphere at about 2 3 of total carbon dioxide and about 13 of total sulphur oxides emissions imo 2014 sofiev et al 2018 with developments towards carbon neutrality in other sectors shipping may in 2050 represent up to 17 of global greenhouse gas emissions unless significant measures are implemented in the sector halim et al 2018 one way to increase energy efficiency in the shipping sector is to better manage underwater hull and propeller surfaces which are prone to mechanical surface defects and marine growth or biofouling additionally less biofouling would mean a lower risk of spread of non native invasive aquatic species that may be transported on ship hulls and disturb receiving ecosystems davidson et al 2016 however for evaluating the effectiveness of different hull management options any improvements in hull and propeller condition must be measured accurately and transparently imo 2011a hull and propeller roughness caused by substrate or coating defects and marine growth biofouling leads to significant penalties in terms of increased propulsive power or decreased speed schultz 2007 it is estimated that roughly 7 10 of yearly shipping emissions to air could be avoided by using best available fouling control technologies for hull and propellers imo 2011a today marine fouling is controlled by applying underwater coatings which typically function by release of biocides or by self cleaning i e foul release properties yebra et al 2004 these coatings are also used in combination with in water cleaning by divers or remotely operated vehicles rovs imo 2011b abrasion resistant hull coatings which do not exhibit any fouling control properties may also be an option for some vessels though requiring more frequent in water cleaning van rompay 2013 available methods for estimating hull and propeller performance from onboard monitored data are typically based on physical models these methods aim at modelling and correcting for factors such as vessel loading condition sea currents wind resistance and added resistance in waves andersen et al 2005 munk et al 2009 more recently other methods such as multiple regression and machine learning have been suggested for detecting changes in hull performance which are not based on physical modelling of the ship adland et al 2018 bocchetti et al 2015 coraddu et al 2019 pedersen 2015 finally underwater hull inspections conducted by divers or using rovs are still useful in identifying the need for in water maintenance naval sea systems command 2006 if a given hull condition and its equivalent roughness height can be estimated to an acceptable level of accuracy scaling up procedures or increased resistance diagrams can be used in estimating resistance penalties due to hull roughness on a specific vessel size and speed demirel et al 2019 however accurate predictions of propulsive power penalties from inspections and roughness profile measurements are still elusive especially for soft forms of marine growth murphy et al 2019 the recent iso 19030 2016 standard on hull and propeller performance paved the way for increased transparency in hull and propeller performance monitoring detailing requirements in terms of sensor accuracy sampling frequency reference power speed curves filtering and correction procedures this iso standard follows a physical model approach where the power speed curves for a vessel must be known for different loading conditions i e varying draft and trim and where wind resistance is corrected for also collected data is filtered before analysis using only data points associated with calm weather stable course and speed and deep unconfined and ice free waters iso 2016 however the standard deals with hull performance for a vessel compared to itself between different periods in time i e the change in performance from a reference period to that of an evaluation period the standard is therefore not intended for comparisons between vessels besides numerous measurement and modelling uncertainties involved in any comparison paereli and krapp 2017 one of the reasons for this limitation stems from the selection of a performance value the percentage speed difference v diff which is not only vessel dependent but also a direct function of the measured speed bertram 2017 1 v d i f f v m v p v p 100 where v m and v p are the measured and predicted speeds respectively v diff is thus defined relative to a predicted speed v p i e the speed that would be attained at a reference hull condition for a given vessel it is well known that the importance of hull roughness penalty relative to total propulsion powering typically decreases for increasing speed due to higher wave making resistance at higher speed schultz 2007 woods hole oceanografic institute 1952 thus speed dependency is expected for relative percentage penalties such as percentage speed difference v diff the aim of the current work is to propose a new performance indicator that would enable comparisons between vessels as well as calculations on power consumption under operational speed and loading conditions differing from originally recorded data the latter is of special interest when sudden changes in operating conditions are called for e g slow steaming for economic or environmental reasons psaraftis and kontovas 2013 a hydraulic roughness height which aims at representing the hull roughness that gives rise to a measured penalty would in principle fulfil such requirements a procedure to determine equivalent sand grain roughness height is currently described and applied to data from three vessels belonging to two different shipping segments one panamax product tanker which operates worldwide and two sister roro vessels roll on roll off cargo the latter on a short sea route advantages and limitations of different hull performance indicators are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 vessel details three vessels are currently studied with kind permission from two collaborating shipping companies vessels a b and c table 1 vessel a is a 75 000 tonne deadweight panamax product tanker operating worldwide vessels b and c are two sister roro vessels exclusively operating a short sea route in the north sea besides different routes vessel a differs from vessels b and c in terms of size hull form design speed activity maximum consecutive idle time and dry docking interval table 1 these distinct specifications provide contrasting conditions for deterioration in hull performance woods hole oceanografic institute 1952 thus in principle tanker a is more prone to marine fouling than roro s b and c since the tanker is slower 14 knots design speed for the tanker or 7 2 m s versus 22 5 knots for the roro or 11 6 m s less active 51 activity versus 65 with longer maximum continuous idle time 93 days versus only 12 14 days operates in both tropical and temperate waters i e high and low fouling versus temperate waters with relatively less fouling and has a longer dry docking interval 5 years versus only 2 3 years underwater hull coatings were initially of the same type for all three vessels i e biocidal tributyltin free tbt free self polishing coatings spc however in the last dry docking vessels b and c were both retrofitted with non biocidal coatings in the case of vessel b an abrasion resistant coating arc with no fouling control properties and in the case of vessel c a silicone foul release coating frc 2 2 monitored data onboard monitored data forms the basis for any hull performance analysis the primary variables are speed and delivered power whereas secondary variables such as environmental and loading conditions are used for filtering and correcting data to reference conditions for the current vessels available data is summarized in table 2 with a total sampling period spanning at least 3 5 years for each vessel according to standard iso 19030 2016 part 2 default method monitored variables table 2 should be auto logged at a sampling frequency of 0 07 hz i e every 15 s with a note referring that 10 min blocks of data can be useful for analysis excluded from this frequency requirements are loading conditions of draft and trim which should be monitored when altered in part 3 of the iso standard alternative methods use of lower sampling frequencies is allowed for provided that variables are collected at the same sampling rate iso 2016 the latter is the case for monitored data provided by two shipping companies with noon reports available for the tanker vessel a and 10 min averaged values for roro vessels b and c table 2 sensor manufacturer specifications could not be presently verified against iso 19030 2016 requirements on sensor accuracy plausibility checks were carried out using histograms and time series for all variables supplementary material figures s 1 s 5 this procedure led to the early detection of various issues with speed loggers on all vessels figure s 4 namely significant drift and bias towards following currents for vessel a figure s 4a unlikely high currents 15 knots and bias towards following currents for vessel b figure s 4b long silent gaps due to sensor or data collection failure on vessel c figure s 4c considering these issues speed over ground sog is used as a proxy for speed through water stw though introducing effects of sea currents iso 19030 2016 part 3 which leads to increased noise in performance values as well as some bias error these effects should however approximately average out over periods of time of a few months and a noisy sog is currently preferred in detriment of a stw signal that drifts on the same time scale as the signal of interest i e changes in hull and propeller performance iso 2016 still it should be noted that due to the nonlinear relation between power and speed even if the difference between sog and stw is approximately zero on a long time average a few months the propulsive power will be underestimated assuming a power to speed third order relation a variation in stw of 1 knot on a constant sog of 12 knots would mean a 8 3 symmetrical variation in speed causing an asymmetrical 23 27 variation in power in this simplified case power determined from a varying stw would be on average about 1 2 higher than power predicted from a constant sog regarding secondary variables vessels b and c had 10 min averaged auto logged data from onboard instrumentation whereas vessel a had daily average values manually input by the crew the latter included average wind speed and direction beaufort scale and quadrants and out of performance codes intended for data filtering in the context of charter party performance clauses out of performance codes enabled to identify data points associated with varying course proxy for rudder angle confined waters and navigation in ice finally while draft values for vessel a were taken before each voyage leg draft values for vessels b and c 10 min averages had to be filtered for an idle ship with sog 0 5 knots currently used as a criterion the later filtering is required since draft measurements relied on pressure readings which are significantly affected by hydrodynamic effects on hull pressure schmode et al 2019 additional parameters were available for vessels b and c including air temperature c which was used in calculating air density for wind resistance corrections iso 19030 2016 part 2 and hindcast significant wave height m which was used as an additional weather filter detailed below under section 2 4 2 3 external data the second essential dataset in any physical model based hull performance analysis consists of reference baselines for delivered power or reference power speed curves as well as hydrostatic tables such data should cover the speed and loading conditions corresponding to the actual operation of the vessels iso 2016 results from resistance and self propulsion tests were made available by shipping companies for both the tanker and the roro sister ships as reported by their contracted towing tanks in order to obtain reference curves for the smooth hull condition from here on referred to as smooth power speed curves all reference curves from the towing tank were corrected by subtracting townsin s roughness allowance with standard peak to valley roughness height of 150 μm as per widely adopted procedure for prediction of full scale performance from model tests ittc 2017 reference baselines for the roro ships vessels b and c covered draft trim and speed conditions respectively in ranges 5 60 7 65 m 1 2 to 1 5 m positive trim by stern i e bow up and 15 0 to 22 5 knots 7 7 11 6 m s with a resolution of 4 6 and 16 levels for each parameter respectively significantly coarser towing tank results were accessible for the tanker vessel a with self propulsion tests available only for one draft 12 20 m null trim even keel and speed in the range 12 00 17 00 knots with steps of 0 50 knots therefore for vessel a power speed curves for other conditions were derived using an approximate power prediction method holtrop and mennen 1982 which was calibrated using the single power speed curve available from the towing tank results are presented in fig 1 including the calibrated holtrop mennen method showing relatively good agreement after multiplication of predicted power by a correction factor of 0 83 this approach was deemed sufficiently accurate for the current demonstrative purpose finally diver reports were available for most in water cleaning events on vessel a and for in water cleaning performed also on vessel b these documents included reporting on observed type of fouling estimated height and percentage cover of fouling on different parts of the hull and description of paint condition descriptions were accompanied by photographs taken both before and after in water cleaning 2 4 percentage difference in speed vdiff raw data is filtered according to iso 19030 2016 except where noted in the text with non iso by removing data points with incomplete data except for loading condition and filtering out 1 data points with wind speed above 7 9 m s or above beaufort level 4 2 data points associated with significant shallow water effects i e depth 3 b t or depth 2 75 v 2 g whichever limit is larger where g is the gravitational acceleration and b t and v are the ship s breadth mean draft and speed in the case of vessel a data points with indication of shallow confined waters depth 20 m non iso 3 draft trim speed and delivered power values outside range of reference power speed curves except vessel a which is only filtered for power and speed non iso 4 rudder angle 5 and 10 min standard error 1 in case of vessel a coded remark on varying course and speed non iso 5 surface water temperature 2 c in case of vessel a coded remark on navigation in ice non iso an additional filter for excluding data points with significant wave height 1 m is applied on data from vessels b and c aiming at improved accuracy non iso indeed a low wind condition 7 9 m s is not sufficient for a low significant wave height as observed by plotting wave height against wind speed in figure s 6 where wave heights up to 3 m are observed at wind speed 7 9 m s after filtering the delivered power on vessels b and c is corrected for wind resistance iso 19030 2016 annex g using the longitudinal resistance coefficient values for a car carrier larsson and raven 2010 no wind correction was attempted on vessel a due to the coarser scale reported by the crew beaufort and quadrants non iso thus for vessel a reported daily average beaufort is only used in filtering for calm weather conditions calm weather beaufort 4 finally the percentage difference in speed v diff is determined using equation 1 where measured speed v m corresponds to sog due to drifting or otherwise unreliable stw measurements figure s 4 the predicted speed v p is obtained from power speed curves either by interpolating power speed curves using corrected power and measured draft and trim spline interpolation vessels b and c or by creating an approximate power speed curve based on the holtrop mennen method with measured draft and trim and then interpolating based on delivered power vessel a non iso to be specific it should be noted that v diff is not a performance indicator on its own but only a performance value in iso 19030 2016 an indicator is defined as the change in average performance values i e the change between average percentage speed difference v diff in the evaluation period e g after a drydocking and average v diff in a reference period e g before drydocking thus by using a change in v diff as an indicator the iso standard avoids any interpretation of v diff in absolute terms 2 5 equivalent sand grain roughness height ks for the newly proposed performance indicator which is intended to be used as an absolute measure of hull and propeller performance the same initial filtering and correction procedures is applied as in the iso 19030 2016 approach except where noted above however instead of calculating percentage speed difference power speed curves are interpolated for determining differences in propulsive power 2 p d i f f p m p p p p 100 δ p p p 100 where the measured power p m corrected for wind resistance is compared against the predicted power p p the latter p p is obtained from interpolation of the smooth power speed curves using measured speed v m the δ p value in equation 2 i e the difference between measured power p m and predicted power p p is then used for determining an equivalent sand grain roughness height k s representing the sand grain hull roughness height that would result in δ p according to the procedure summarized in fig 2 and detailed below it should be noted that hull and propeller performance is still aggregated into a single indicator so the ship is currently modelled as a uniformly rough hull with a smooth propeller in order to separate hull and propeller performance both shaft torque and thrust measurements would be required which is not yet included in the standard procedure iso 2016 the concept of an equivalent sand roughness has been frequently applied as a common currency between disparate roughness types or roughness textures bradshaw 2000 schlichting 1979 schultz et al 2015 at roughness scales relevant for large marine vessels it is generally accepted that the hydrodynamic effect of most types of roughness on the boundary layer is represented by a downward shift in the logarithmic overlap layer or roughness function δ u this roughness function assumes a linear asymptote as a function of the logarithm of the roughness reynolds number k k u τ ν where k is an arbitrary roughness height u τ is the friction velocity and ν is the fluid s kinematic viscosity provided that k is high enough flack and schultz 2014 this high k regime is denominated fully rough regime and δ u data for all types of roughness can thus be collapsed by replacing the arbitrary roughness height k by the equivalent sand grain roughness height k s the latter must be obtained experimentally flack and schultz 2010 sand grain roughness height is therefore an hydraulic roughness height which serves as a common currency between disparate types of roughness bradshaw 2000 and enables modelling of ship resistance penalties demirel et al 2017 schultz 2007 even though the roughness function δ u collapses for all types of roughness at high enough k s fully rough regime different types of roughness may have different roughness functions δ u at intermediate ranges of k s i e in the transitionally rough regime a suitable roughness function must thus be specified in order to model roughness penalties for a specific roughness type for marine fouling and hull coatings the roughness function described in demirel et al 2017 is currently adopted which is based on experimental data selected by schultz 2007 3 δ u 0 k s 3 1 κ ln 0 26 k s s i n π 2 log k s 3 log 5 3 k s 15 1 κ ln 0 26 k s k s 15 having defined the roughness function δ u f k s the equivalent sand grain roughness height may be used in modelling resistance penalties due to hull roughness at the ship scale either by using wall functions in a computational fluid dynamics cfd approach or by using flat plate granville s similarity law scaling shortened here as granville method demirel et al 2017 schultz 2007 fig 2 illustrates the proposed procedure for deriving the performance indicator k s from vessel data first both monitored and external data are combined for determining the difference in propulsive power due to hull and propeller roughness δ p at a given time t an initial guess for equivalent sand grain roughness k s 0 is provided as an input to the function find k s from which the first value for resistance penalty δ r 0 is determined using a suitable scaling procedure e g granville method and taking into account both vessel speed and loading condition at time t for determining δ r the granville method is selected which typically runs in 0 1 s on a laptop computer in detriment of a prohibitively computation expensive cfd approach demirel et al 2017 the granville method is implemented as described in schultz 2007 where roughness effects on ship scale resistance are modelled as on a flat plate with same length and wetted surface area as the hull function of loading conditions and travelling at measured speed v m implementation of granville method has been verified against previous results figure s 7 the obtained δ r is then converted to an increase in propulsive power by taking vessel speed v m and propulsive efficiency η d into account 4 δ p i r r o u g h v m η d r o u g h r s m o o t h v m η d s m o o t h δ r v m η d where propulsive efficiency η d is assumed to be unaffected by hull roughness i e η d r o u g h η d s m o o t h η d due to cancelling effects of decreased open water propeller efficiency and increased hull efficiency svensen 1983 pp 49 61 the latter approximation has also been confirmed for the kriso containership where a cfd study on the self propelled full scale vessel showed less than 1 variation in η d with increasing hull roughness provided that the propeller is smooth song et al 2020 values for η d are thus obtained directly from self propulsion tests conducted in towing tanks for the reference hull condition at speed v m any propeller roughness effects on η d are included as an equivalent effect on δ r following a smooth propeller approach should onboard thrust measurements become available in the future propeller modelling would be attempted to include propeller roughness effects on η d finally calculated δ p i values are compared to the absolute value of δ p t on each iteration fig 2 first decision node and k s i re estimated iteratively until a given tolerance on δ p is reached currently a tolerance of 1 on δ p is used the above iterative procedure is implemented in matlab version r2017b mathworks natick ma usa with a total of 10 iterations required for a tolerance of 1 on δ p fig 2 first decision node or a computation time of about 1 s per data point on a laptop computer further the procedure allows for future implementation of parallel computing thus reducing wall clock computation time a limitation of the above procedure consists in it being unable to represent negative δ p values i e a reduction in drag relative to the smooth reference power speed curve arising from scatter in the data bias of the data and or errors in obtaining the power speed baseline for avoiding such negative δ p values instead of calculating k s for every filtered data point only the median values of p diff for 3 month time blocks are currently used three months is the recommended minimum time interval for maintenance triggers and for evaluating maintenance effects iso 2016 the obtained k s values are thus calculated for specific points in time yet representing the median p diff value or in case of an even number of data points the two values closest to the median which is less sensitive to outliers than a simple time average of p diff further the median p diff value or two values closest to the median is associated with specific loading and speed conditions as required for calculating k s fig 2 which would not be the case for a time averaged p diff since both loading and speed conditions vary within the 3 month period for comparison purposes k s values tabulated in previous studies are used schultz 2007 as well as referring to hull fouling conditions reported by divers for the latter

kendall s rank correlation coefficient τ k is used a value of 1 indicates reverse ranking for two given variables i e if one variable increases monotonically the second variable decreases monotonically 1 indicates the same ranking i e both variables increase monotonically and a value of 0 indicates no relationship between variables matlab version r2017b mathworks natick ma usa additionally p values are calculated for each τ k value where a p value 0 05 means significant correlation at a 95 confidence level for determining statistical significance of changes in v diff and p diff confidence intervals are calculated at a 95 confidence level by multiplying the standard error within 3 month time intervals by two tailed t student value with n 1 degrees of freedom where n is the number of observations montgomery 2013 the sparsity in calculated k s values did not currently allow for determining statistical significance within 3 month periods 3 results and discussion 3 1 power speed charts power speed charts are presented in fig 3 for unfiltered data together with selected smooth reference curves for one loading condition generally it is observed that most measured points do not seem to follow the shape of reference curves particularly for vessel a data points seem to approximately follow three discretized levels of delivered power with widely varying measured speed fig 3a for vessels b and c some shape can be recognized which approximately follows parallel to the reference curve even though data points are observed which show an apparently higher slope fig 3b c additionally for vessel b some points are observed very close to the x axis in a combination of high cruising speed with low delivered power falling far below the reference curve fig 3b upon investigation these latter points were attributed to a period when the shaft torque sensor was out of service thence the extremely low power values finally power speed data presented in these charts includes all environmental and operational factors that affect propulsive power which makes it impossible to evaluate each factor separately without any type of filtering or correction munk et al 2009 filtered power speed data are presented in fig 4 where effects from environmental conditions have been filtered and or corrected for except sea currents using sog as measured speed predicted power values are also represented red dots which were derived from reference curves using vessel loading condition and measured speed thus each measured data point black dots has its equivalent predicted power based on measured speed red dots it is noted that a significant amount of data was filtered out fig 4 compared to fig 3 more specifically 80 and 95 of the data were excluded by filtering for vessels a and b c respectively faced with such a high percentage of excluded data it could be argued that there is a large potential for obtaining denser information on hull and propeller performance in the future provided that environmental factors can be accurately accounted for e g by developing corrections for added resistance in waves and corrections for shallow water effects compared to power speed charts in fig 3 filtered and corrected data in fig 4 is observed to follow more closely the reference points except for vessel a for the latter vessel delivered power is mostly contained within a band located at 5 7 mw and does not show any apparent slope for a wide range of speeds 10 14 knots fig 4a such lack of match between measured and reference points seems to already suggest a widely varying hull and propeller performance this performance will be next analysed in further detail using time series for performance values indicator 3 2 performance values and indicator time series for performance values indicator are presented in figs 5 7 respectively for difference in speed v diff difference in power p diff and equivalent sand roughness k s 3 2 1 percentage difference in speed from comparison between measured and predicted speed equation 1 time series for difference in speed v diff are plotted in fig 5 along with time series for measured speed v m knots confidence intervals for v diff are presented in table 3 for periods of 3 months before after each maintenance event results not shown for in water cleaning on vessel a since the high frequency of the cleanings would result in extensive overlapping of comparison intervals for vessel a fig 5a the speed difference performance value is initially close to zero and starts to deviate considerably towards negative values after the second in water cleaning event second vertical dashed line with around 20 speed loss before the third cleaning event from then on the time series resembles a saw shaped function with higher speed penalties typically coinciding with the period before a cleaning event or dry docking vertical dashed and solid lines respectively these trends agree with expected deteriorating hull condition during each maintenance interval the dry docking on vessel a decreased the speed penalty significantly from 9 16 to 1 4 penalty table 3 vessel a dd1 95 confidence intervals for v diff a pattern resembling the saw shaped function of v diff is also noted in the measured speed v m time series fig 5a suggesting a correlation between the two variables indeed when v diff is plotted against v m fig 8 a only the data points associated with calculated 3 month p diff medians are shown a significant correlation is found with a kendall s rank correlation coefficient τ k of 0 562 p value 2 10 5 0 05 i e significant correlation care should be taken in interpreting this correlation since it is not clear how much of this is caused by 1 the very definition of v diff equation 1 from which 100 correlation would be expected between v diff and v m at constant delivered power and loading condition i e constant slope 1 v p in equation 1 or 2 speed dependent roughness penalties due to varying importance of these penalties at different speeds due to increasing wave making resistance with increasing speed additionally any inaccuracies due to use of the approximate holtrop mennen method for extrapolating towing tank results fig 1 may have had an impact on speed dependencies of v diff though this is considered negligible when data points are directly compared to towing tank results at a delivered power of 6 mw towing tank data gives a predicted speed of 13 knots fig 1 black dots whereas filtered results exhibit speeds as low as 10 11 knots at 6 mw fig 4a this direct comparison corroborates significant hull and propeller penalties 2 3 knots speed loss considering that towing tank data represents a laden vessel draft t 12 20 m i e low speed for a given propulsion power regarding speed penalties for vessels b c fig 5b c data points are significantly denser in time than for vessel a as expected from a higher sampling frequency 10 min frequency versus noon reports results still show a high level of noise at times exceeding 10 percentage points fig 5b c which is approximately at the same level as noise observed for vessel a fig 5a for both vessels b and c a downward trend in v diff i e an increasing penalty seems to occur in the interval between first and second dry docking vertical solid lines which is confirmed by non overlapping confidence intervals between 3 months after the first dry docking table 3 dd1 after and 3 months before the second dry dockings table 3 dd2 before for vessels b and c no significant correlation is found between v diff and v m fig 8b c with τ k ranging 0 021 to 0 205 p value 0 92 and 0 23 0 05 respectively i e no significant relationship to a large extent a lower correlation for these vessels is probably due to a wider range of delivered power fig 4b c resulting in a widely varying slope 1 v p in equation 1 as opposed to a fairly constant power for vessel a fig 4a 3 2 2 percentage difference in power as an alternative to speed penalty fig 5 percentage power penalties p diff are plotted in fig 6 the latter are obtained by comparing measured powered p m corrected for wind resistance to the predicted power p p obtained from reference curves interpolated for operational conditions i e vessel loading draft and trim and speed v m as in speed penalty results there is a clear saw shape trend in p diff for vessel a with drop in p diff coinciding with maintenance events especially on the 3rd 5th and 7th in water cleanings and finally on dry docking fig 6a the latter dry docking dd1 is associated with a significant drop in power penalty with non overlapping confidence intervals for the 3 month averaged p diff table 3 vessel a dd1 median p diff on each 3 month block are plotted as red circles in fig 6 and it should be noted that given the short intervals between cleaning events on vessel a these 3 month blocks may overlap in time e g between the 3rd and the 4th cleaning for both vessels b and c a slight slope is again detected between the two dry dockings and a significant improvement in performance immediately after each dry docking fig 6b c with non overlapping confidence intervals for 3 month time averaged p diff table 3 vessels b c dd1 and dd2 the level of correlation between p diff and speed v m is significant for vessel a fig 8a τ k 0 525 with p value 6 10 5 0 05 but non significant for vessels b and c τ k 0 088 and 0 095 for vessels b and c respectively with p value 0 6 0 05 i e no significant relationship between variables for vessel a the level of correlation is lower compared to that of v diff versus v m and there is now a reverse relationship i e p diff decreases with increasing speed v m fig 8a vessel a significantly negative τ k of 0 525 such negative dependency is expected since wave making resistance increases with speed and wave making resistance is typically assumed to be unaffected by hull roughness schultz 2007 woods hole oceanografic institute 1952 a lower correlation for p diff versus v m as compared to v diff versus v m may be due to removal of the direct dependency on v m as implied by the definition of v diff equation 1 finally considering the noise in the results i e at least 50 percentage point amplitude oscillations in p diff fig 6 it is not surprising that some data points lie below the reference curve on the power speed charts fig 4 resulting in some share of negative power difference values fig 6 these negative results would mean a lower drag for the in service condition compared to the reference which is currently attributed to inaccuracies in both monitored and external data on the one hand sensor or sampling inaccuracies and on the other hand physical modelling errors in obtaining or interpolating smooth reference power speed curves baselines regarding the latter reference curves which are currently based on model tests performed in towing tanks these have been corrected down to a smooth condition by removing an estimated hull roughness allowance however it could not be confirmed whether the towing tanks used the same formula townsin s formula or the standard peak to valley height of 150 μm as per recommended procedure ittc 2017 indeed available towing tank reports included only the aggregate model to ship correlation allowance coefficients which include also other resistance components thus it is plausible that the reference curves supposedly valid for a smooth hull condition might still contain some roughness allowance which would in part explain a negative p diff 3 2 3 equivalent sand grain roughness height results using the newly proposed performance indicator the equivalent sand grain roughness height k s fig 2 are presented in time series in fig 7 which are based on δ p values associated with median p diff values in 3 month time blocks the same time block size of three months is used in all comparisons as this is the recommended minimum for evaluating maintenance effects as well as maintenance triggers iso 2016 previously observed trends in time series for p diff fig 6 are again noted in the time series for k s including a saw shaped function for vessel a and an apparent increase in modelled roughness for vessels b and c in the interval between the two dry dockings fig 7 in the case of vessel a it is now possible to compare peak k s values before each cleaning with estimated values based on diver reports fig 7a markers qualitative agreement is achieved where considerably high roughness is detected before cleaning events with some overestimation in the case of diver reports it should be noted here that the estimates for hard fouling height and percentage cover from diver reports as used in equation 5 are associated with admittedly high uncertainty depending on diver s experience and methods used for estimating fouling size and percentage cover special reserve must be exercised regarding the third cleaning report fig 7a k s 20 cm which described extremely large barnacles 10 cm in height with associated uncertainties probably in the centimetre range also equation 5 was derived by schultz 2004 using drag results for considerably smaller barnacles 5 7 mm possibly rendering the current extrapolation inaccurate in regard to the actual hydrodynamic effect of larger barnacles 10 100 mm in height overall and according to tabulated values provided by schultz 2007 hull condition on vessel a fig 7a varied between a deteriorated hull coating or light slime after each in water cleaning i e k s 100 μm and medium heavy calcareous fouling before each cleaning event i e k s 3000 μm the latter agrees with the heavily fouled condition reported by divers before in water cleanings with k s values based on diver reports mostly in the 10 000 μm order of magnitude fig 7a markers within 30 days from modelled k s values red circles and a deteriorated coating detected after each cleaning please refer to supplementary figure s 8 finally dry docking of vessel a at t 1550 days had a significant effect on equivalent roughness with an almost two orders of magnitude decrease in three month average k s from 2100 μm before dry docking dd1 to only 60 μm on out docking table 3 vessel a dd1 these values correspond to a decrease from small medium calcareous fouling before dd1 to a typical as applied or deteriorated coating on out docking schultz 2007 on the first dry docking dd1 both vessels b and c register a significant improvement in performance table 3 and fig 7b c corresponding to a drop from k s 80 130 μm deteriorated coating or light slime down to k s 60 70 μm after dd1 which is still rougher than a typically as applied af coating k s 30 μm schultz 2007 for the same vessels b and c performance deteriorated significantly in the interval between dry dockings dd1 and dd2 when a biocidal spc hull coating was in use such deterioration is observed in fig 7b c as an apparent increase in k s from below 100 μm after the first dry docking to above or close to 100 μm i e a deteriorated coating or light slime schultz 2007 before the second dry docking see also table 3 vessels b c dd1 after and dd2 before which is backed by a statistically significant change in three month average v diff and p diff table 3 these roughness values are about an order of magnitude lower than peak values observed on vessel a table 3 reflecting the more challenging conditions faced by vessel a in terms of fouling prevention most notably vessel a s long idle periods up to 90 days calling ports in high fouling areas worldwide table 1 regarding the second dry docking dd2 k s decreases for vessel b when the hull coating was retrofitted to a non biocidal abrasion resistant coating arc in table 3 for vessel b k s 130 μm before dd2 to k s 50 μm after dd2 however the first in water hull cleaning after coating application performed at around eight months after dd2 does not seem to have affected k s fig 7b and table 3 vessel b hc1 such abrasion resistant coatings typically require frequent in water hull cleanings since these coatings do not exhibit any properties against fouling van rompay 2013 the diver report for this cleaning event indicates that cleaning was only performed on the vertical sides which presented slime 90 cover and short weed 20 mm in length 10 cover with no hard fouling present and a foul free flat bottom these observations agree with k s results which correspond to k s 100 μm around this in water cleaning event fig 7b equivalent to a deteriorated coating or light slime schultz 2007 a significant improvement in hull and propeller performance is also detected for vessel c on the second dry docking dd2 on which a non biocidal foul release product frc was applied thus for vessel c k s 100 μm before dd2 dropped significantly to k s 30 μm after dd2 table 3 vessel c a null time averaged p diff value was achieved in the last three months of data table 3 vessel c which would mean an hydraulically smooth hull null or even negative power penalties may be due to inaccuracies in either or both measured and or reference data namely a wrongly assumed hull roughness allowance used in correcting towing tank data to smooth power speed curves section 2 3 nevertheless compared to the previous dry docking table 3 vessel c dd1 these results suggest superior drag performance for frc compared to spc which is in line with previous laboratory testing on both coating types candries et al 2003 compared to the correlation between v diff and measured speed v m τ k of 0 562 for vessel a a slightly lower correlation in absolute value could be achieved between k s and v m with τ k of 0 547 for vessel a fig 8 which is nevertheless statistically significant p value 3 10 5 0 05 and higher than for p diff for vessels b and c correlations between k s and v m remained non significant fig 8b c k s versus v m with p value 0 05 equivalent sand roughness k s presents thus similar dependency on vessel speed as the standard speed loss iso 2016 with most of the high k s values observed towards the lowest speed fig 8a considering that speed is theoretically corrected for in calculating k s the remaining relation between k s and speed v m is probably due to modelling errors and sampling bias according to the latter hypothesis of sampling bias lower speed slow steaming is accepted whenever the vessel is significantly fouled this reciprocal dependency i e a dependency of vessel speed on hull condition could arise from engine performance optimization suggested by an approximately constant propulsive power at 5000 7000 kw fig 4a which is well below the maximum continuous rating of 13 560 kw table 1 therefore the above testing with kendall s coefficient is inconclusive since the cause of the correlation between roughness and measured speed cannot be ascertained finally one may ask just how much speed dependency can be expected on percentage power penalty p diff for a certain hull condition as caused by increasing wave making component with speed this question is better answered by modelling power penalties for a set of hull conditions as presented in fig 9 where power speed curves are given for vessels a and b c fig 9a together with their respective p diff values in fig 9b first of all it is noted that p diff increases or decreases with speed depending on where on the power speed curve one looks thus for vessel a the expected negative dependency on speed is only observed at sufficiently high speed above 15 knots i e when wave making resistance increases more rapidly fig 9a vessel a start of a hump on the power speed curve for the smooth hull for v 15 knots however since the current operational speed is below 15 knots figs 3 and 4 the expected dependency should actually be reversed i e an increase in p diff with increasing speed fig 9b vessel a for v 15 knots due to an increasing effect of roughness on the boundary layer flow this increase in p diff with speed is contrary to the trend observed in fig 8a decreasing p diff with increasing speed which further supports that the speed dependency observed in fig 8a is most probably due to sampling bias i e foul hull conditions are mostly sampled at low speeds in other words dependencies observed in fig 8a seem to arise mostly from a dependency of operational speed on rough hull penalties rather than the other way around further for vessel b c since the hump in power speed curves due to wave making resistance fig 9a vessels b c is not as strong as for vessel a fig 9a vessel a the speed dependency of p diff is also less strong at higher speeds fig 9b vessels b c which agrees well with the low correlation found for vessels b and c fig 8b and c 3 3 towards comparison between vessels from results presented in the previous subsections it is clear that calculated equivalent sand grain k s is subject to the same measurement and reference curve uncertainties as the iso 19030 performance value v diff adding to these uncertainties k s includes further modelling and numerical errors introduced in the iterative procedure of fig 2 therefore considering that trends in hull and propeller performance are already detected in the time series for v diff or p diff why should additional effort be invested in calculating a hydraulic roughness a meaningful comparison between vessels using an absolute measure of hull and propeller performance is the ultimate goal of performance analysis paereli and krapp 2017 in the newly proposed approach of calculating k s the effects of vessel speed and loading condition on the share of hull roughness penalty can be eliminated in so far as these effects are accurately represented on the contrary v diff and p diff are still specific for each vessel and operating point as further demonstrated in this section in fig 10 performance values v diff and p diff are plotted against k s for the current three vessels results from previous studies are also included for reference and comparison where the granville method was applied to other vessel types demirel et al 2017 schultz 2007 since the current implementation of the granville method was verified against previous results figure s 7 any scatter observed in fig 10 should reflect dependencies of v diff or p diff in regard to vessel type and operating conditions loading and speed from fig 10a at a modelled k s of 1000 μm which represents small calcareous fouling or weed schultz 2007 v diff corresponds to 6 for the us navy frigate and up to 11 for the current tanker vessel a at such roughness height this corresponds to a variation in v diff of 5 percentage points between vessels alternatively by comparing p diff results at the same k s of 1000 μm a maximum variation of up to 30 percentage points is noted between the us navy frigate at high speed fig 10b 30 power penalty and the kriso containership at low speed fig 10b 60 power penalty the curves diverge for increasing k s fig 10 demonstrating the potentially large impact of both hull type and operating conditions on both v diff and p diff this divergence limits the direct comparison between vessels using percentage penalties which might be of relevance e g in comparing quality of surface preparation and coating application between different shipyards working on different vessel types e g a naval shipyard compared to a large merchant vessel shipyard most alarmingly variability is also noted when comparing a vessel to itself which undermines the very aim of the iso 19030 2016 standard these variations are due to changing operational speed and loading conditions for example at a k s of 1000 μm small calcareous fouling or weed percentage power penalty p diff fig 10b increases 9 10 percentage points with decreasing vessel speed on each of us navy frigate schultz 2007 and kriso containership demirel et al 2017 therefore for vessels with significant variation in operational speed and loading conditions the impact of operating point on performance values v diff and p diff cannot be neglected potentially introducing a significant level of uncertainty in comparing a vessel to itself over time an approach that aims at correcting for the above issues is therefore justified namely by modelling the roughness effects for each specific vessel as currently proposed in order to compare the performance of different vessels whether the discussed uncertainty in v diff or p diff is higher than modelling and numerical errors introduced in estimating k s will surely depend on how widely the compared vessels differ in terms of vessel particulars as well as on their operational profile regarding uncertainties in k s modelling these remain to be quantified experimentally e g through full scale trials on vessels with fully characterized surface roughness for which k s must be known however provided that the same modelling procedure is used a comparison between vessels would still remain valid as long as modelling errors are kept constant additionally convergence errors in the find k s function fig 2 can be further minimized by decreasing the tolerance on δ p currently set at 1 tolerance finally provided that inaccuracies in monitored data and physical modelling are further quantified and minimized in particular the challenge of accurately measuring speed through water figure s 4 the equivalent roughness height k s is a promising candidate as an absolute indicator for hull and propeller performance such indicator would be utilized in comparing the hull and propeller condition between different vessels as well as comparing a vessel s performance to itself over time with improved accuracy additionally k s may be used in calculating vessel performance under operating conditions that may differ significantly from available monitored data e g when switching to from slow steaming 4 conclusions a transparent method for comparing hull and propeller performance of a vessel to itself over time was recently released under standard iso 19030 2016 however the standard performance value i e percentage speed difference is not only vessel specific but also sensitive to speed and vessel loading conditions aiming at an absolute indicator for hull and propeller performance the present study utilizes the concept of equivalent sand grain roughness height k s by iteratively modelling power penalties application of the novel indicator on three studied vessels resulted in qualitative agreement with hull condition reported by divers however though k s would in principle be independent from speed there is still a correlation between k s and measured speed for one of the vessels vessel a this correlation is currently attributed to sampling bias in the data further research is required to minimize measurement errors in monitored data separate propeller performance through onboard thrust measurements and refined propeller modelling and to quantify and minimize modelling errors namely those in the reference power speed draft trim data obtained from model scale resistance tests self propulsion tests and model to ship correlation coefficients an accurately determined hydraulic roughness height or otherwise normalized performance value would enable comparisons between vessels as well as improved accuracy in comparing a vessel s performance to itself over time such comparisons are paramount in evaluating the effectiveness of any energy saving measures on ship hulls and propellers credit authorship contribution statement dinis

21904,this paper proposes a path following control system for unmanned surface vehicles usvs based on an improved integral line of sight los guidance law unlike the conventional los guidance law the look ahead distance is designed as a function of the usv s cruising speed and the cross tracking error to adapt to the different cruising speeds of usvs meanwhile a reduced order state observer is developed for online estimation of the time varying sideslip angle caused by external disturbances such as wind wave and current then a heading controller is further designed using the dynamic surface control technique to track the desired heading angle the guidance system and the reduced order state observer subsystem are proved to be uniformly asymptotically stable and input to state stable respectively the simulation results show that the path following control system designed in this paper can track the desired curved and straight line paths quickly and smoothly at different cruising speeds keywords line of sight unmanned surface vehicle path following look ahead distance reduced order state observer dynamic surface control 1 introduction unmanned surface vehicles usvs have been broadly applied in both military and civilian fields they have become a hot research area in the field of intelligent marine equipment research during recent years liu et al 2016c shi et al 2019 wan et al 2019 in the ever changing uncertain marine environment the ability to accurately quickly and smoothly track the desired path is one of the key technologies to ensure the safety and accomplishment of the usv missions zhang et al 2018 2017 numerous researches have been reported on the path following control of usvs liu et al 2016c usv is a typical underactuated system and there are a set of unintegral second order non holonomic constraints in the system therefore there are certain limitations in using conventional linear methods to achieve path following control wan et al 2018 for nonlinear control methods of path following the lyapunov stability theory is popularly used for the control law design in zhang and zhang 2015 a dynamic virtual ship dvs guidance principle was proposed which used a virtual ship to generate a reference path and then incorporated the neural network and dynamic surface control technique to track the desired trajectory in do and pan 2004 a state and output feedback controller based on the lyapunov direct method and backstepping method was introduced to address the effects caused by external disturbances a nonlinear observer was also introduced to estimate the yaw rate and the roll rate in liang et al 2018 the backstepping the sliding mode control technique and the fuzzy control were further combined to design an adaptive robust path following controller based on the virtual guidance method in miao et al 2017b the backstepping was used to decompose the path following control into two parts the kinematics control and the dynamics control and then the linear extended observer was incorporated to estimate the uncertainties in liao et al 2015 and zhang and zhang 2014 adaptive sliding mode path following controllers based on the backstepping technique were proposed in do 2016 the backstepping technique and the lyapunov direct method were employed to realize the path following of underactuated ships these methods are all direct path following control based on mathematical models however the design of these controllers is complicated due to the usv s complex nonlinearity and uncertainty characteristics in order to simplify the design of the controller the underactuated usv path following control system can be regarded as two parts the guidance subsystem and the control subsystem after acquiring path information and environment information the guidance subsystem generates reference signals for the control subsystem and the control subsystem tracks the reference signals generated by the guidance subsystem so as to realize path following the typical guidance methods are light of sight los guidance pure pursuit guidance vector field guidance constant bearing guidance and so on breivik and fossen 2009 in park et al 2018 the pure pursuit approach was used to design the path following system of autonomous vehicles in xu and guedes soares 2016 a way point scheme based on a vector field algorithm was used to obtain the guidance system for path following of surface marine vessels a time varying vector field guidance law for path following control of autonomous vessels was presented in xu et al 2019 the pure pursuit guidance and vector field guidance are also widely used in the path following of unmanned aerial vehicles yamasaki et al 2009 wilhelm and clem 2019 and unmanned ground vehicles cho et al 2015 the los guidance was firstly combined with the sliding mode control to achieve the path following control of the autonomous underwater vehicles by healey and lienard 1993 the los guidance has low sensitivity to high frequency noises and requires fewer design parameters its principle is independent of the dynamic control and does not rely upon the mathematical model of the system instead it assumes that the desired heading angle can be determined by the ship s real time position and the desired path therefore it is widely used in path following control chen et al 2019 børhaug et al 2011 moreira et al 2007 do et al 2004 a class of proportional los guidance system has been proved to be uniformly semi globally exponentially stable fossen and pettersen 2014 the los guidance has been combined with a set of other technologies for usv path following for example it was combined with the dynamic surface control and the neural network to design the path following controller liu et al 2017a it was combined with the model predictive control technique to achieve path following for underactuated usvs liu et al 2018 it was also combined with the active disturbance rejection sliding mode control technique li et al 2013 and fuzzy logic khaled and chalhoub 2013 mu et al 2018 to achieve path following however the los guidance is vulnerable to the external disturbance that results in deviation problems especially in tracking curved paths børhaug et al 2008 the integral los guidance law increases the robustness of the system fossen and lekkas 2017 and it was employed to achieve the path following for surface ships and underwater vehicles with constant current disturbances caharija et al 2016 it had been proven that the closed loop system is globally uniformly asymptotically stable as well as locally uniformly exponentially stable considering the disturbance factor the integral los guidance law was used to realize the path following of underwater snake like robots with constant wave disturbances kelasidi et al 2017 in addition an oceanic current observer was designed to estimate the external current disturbance in belleter et al 2019 moreover an adaptive los guidance law was proposed in fossen et al 2015 for online estimation of the current disturbance as a constant these methods take the influence of the external current disturbance into consideration but handle the disturbance as a constant in reality however the current disturbance is time varying hence the sideslip angle resulted from the current disturbance is also time varying to deal with the time varying sideslip angle a predictor for online estimation of the time varying sideslip angle was designed in liu et al 2016b a bounded gain forgetting adaptive estimator was designed to predict the time varying sideslip angle and compensate it in wang et al 2019 combined with the los guidance these methods achieve path following for the ship in addition a los path following control method with error constraints was proposed in zheng et al 2018 neural networks and predictors were further combined to estimate the system uncertainty and external disturbances liu et al 2016a a reduced order extended state observer was designed for online estimation of the time varying sideslip angle caused by external disturbances and the los guidance law with error constraints was proposed in liu et al 2017c a finite time disturbance observer for online computation of the time varying sideslip angle was proposed in wang et al 2018b a state observer that estimates the state of the usv and the external disturbance online was presented in liu et al 2019 and the observer error dynamics is input output stable a linear state observer was used for online estimation of the unknown sideslip angle and an adaptive los guidance law was then designed in miao et al 2017a these methods all use a constant look ahead distance when applying the los guidance to achieve more flexible maneuverability and approach to the desired path faster the look ahead distance was designed as a function of the cross tracking error so as to improve the los guidance law lekkas and fossen 2014 the monotonic cubic hermite spline interpolation technique was used to design the path the resultant cascade system consisting of the improved los guidance system and the heading control system is k exponentially stable the look ahead distance was also designed as a function of the cross tracking error in liu et al 2017b and it was then combined with the backstepping method to design the steering controller in order to achieve path following the influence of the ship s speed on path following was further considered in wang et al 2018a the ship s cruising speed was designed as a function of the cross tracking error to increase the robustness and flexibility of the system this paper takes one step further with consideration of the cruising speed of the ship this paper proposes an improved integral los guidance law with the look ahead distance being designed as a function of both the cross tracking error and the cruising speed of the ship the objective is to dispose of the path following at different speeds in addition a state observer is integrated into the los guidance to estimate the time varying sideslip angle the improved integral los guidance law is then used to determine the desired heading angle and a heading controller is further designed by using the dynamic surface control technique to track the desired heading angle and realize the path following eventually the block diagram of the path following system is shown in fig 1 the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the problem formulation of the los guidance for the usv section 3 presents the improved integral los guidance law and analyses the stability of the guidance system section 4 introduces the design of the usv s heading controller using the dynamic surface control technique section 5 presents the simulation results of the proposed path following control system finally section 6 concludes this paper 2 problem formulation an underactuated usv travels at a speed of u and its forward and lateral velocities are u and v respectively then u u 2 v 2 let the position of the usv in the earth fixed reference frame be x y its three degrees of freedom kinematic equations can be represented as fossen 2011 1 x u cos φ v sin φ y u sin φ v cos φ φ r where φ is the heading angle and r is the yaw rate the geometric representation of the los guided usv path following is shown in fig 2 the projection of the usv s position x y on the reference path is x p ω y p ω where ω is a positive path variable and the desired path p ω consisting of a series of waypoints is a non closed path the clockwise rotation angle of the path tangential reference frame at the point x p ω y p ω relative to the earth fixed reference frame is 2 γ p atan 2 y p ω x p ω where x p ω x p ω ω y p ω y p ω ω and the path variable ω satisfies ω u x p ω 2 y p ω 2 0 fossen 2011 the path tracking error in the path tangential reference frame is represented as 3 x e y e cos γ p sin γ p sin γ p cos γ p t x x p ω y y p ω because x p ω y p ω is the projection point of the usv s position coordinates x y on the reference path x e 0 then the cross tracking error is rewritten as 4 y e x x p ω sin γ p y y p ω cos γ p in order to realize path following of the usv the following two key issues need to be addressed 1 selecting an appropriate look ahead distance δ as well as the controller parameters to get the desired heading angle φ d so that lim t y e ε 1 on kinematics 2 designing the control δ so that lim t φ φ d ε 2 on kinetics where ε 1 and ε 2 are very small positive numbers 3 improved integral los guidance design and analysis 3 1 dynamic equation of the tracking error the following equation is derived by differentiating eq 4 with eqs 2 and 3 5 y e x x p ω sin γ p y y p ω cos γ p x x p ω cos γ p y y p ω sin γ p x e 0 x sin γ p y cos γ p substituting eq 1 into eq 5 we have 6 y e u cos φ v sin φ sin γ p u sin φ v cos φ cos γ p u sin φ β γ p u sin χ γ p where β atan 2 v u is the sideslip angle χ is the course angle since the ship is affected by external disturbances such as wind wave and current the heading angle and the course angle are often not equal and they satisfy χ φ β in general the sideslip angle β is non zero and time varying and the sideslip angle is quite small under normal operation usually less than 5 degrees hence it is reasonably approximated as sin β β and cos β 1 eq 6 then becomes 7 y e u sin φ γ p u β cos φ γ p 3 2 look ahead distance computation the look ahead distance determines the performance of the usv path following control system excessive look ahead distance will result in too slow tracking speed while too small look ahead distance will increase system overshoot the look ahead distance computation must consider both the ship s speed and the cross tracking error when the cross tracking error is relatively large a small look ahead distance should be selected to approach to the desired path quickly regardless of the cruising speed as the cross tracking error decreases it is necessary to increase the look ahead distance according to the ship s cruising speed when the cruising speed is relatively fast the look ahead distance needs to be quickly increased to a large value to reduce overshoot in this way the usv is able to smoothly approach to the desired path on the other side when the cruising speed is relatively slow the look ahead distance can be increased slowly so that the usv can approach to the desired path with a short trajectory based on these guidelines the look ahead distance is designed as a function of the ship s cruising speed and the cross tracking error 8 δ k 1 u δ 1 e k 2 y e 2 δ 1 where k 1 and k 2 are controller parameters that satisfy k 1 0 and k 2 0 δ 1 is the minimum look ahead distance when the speed factor is not included let k 1 0 8 k 2 0 01 and δ 1 1 the correlations between the cross tracking errors and the look ahead distances at different speeds are shown in fig 3 it shows that the look ahead distance is mainly determined by the cross tracking error when the cross tracking error is large the larger the cross tracking error is the smaller look ahead distance is when the cross tracking error becomes very large the look ahead distance is δ 1 and the usv approaches to the desired path with a short path as the cross tracking error decreases the influence of the cruising speed on the look ahead distance gradually increases when the cross tracking error is small enough and close to zero the look ahead distance is proportional to the cruising speed the faster the ship cruises the larger look ahead distance is obtained in order to reduce the overshoot the slower the ship cruises the smaller the look ahead distance is obtained in order to approach to the desired path with a shorter path 3 3 reduced order state observer design due to the existence of external disturbances such as the wind wave and current the sideslip angle is time varying it is difficult to accurately measure the sideslip angle in applications the sideslip angle has a significant influence on the path following accuracy and may even affect the stability of the entire path following control system it must be compensated properly to avoid deviating from the desired path of the usv the reduced order state observer has a simple structure and it can estimate the internal state variables of the system according to the input and output of the system in this section a reduced order state observer is introduced for online estimation of the sideslip angle since the sideslip angle is relatively small it is reasonable to assume it has an upper bound i e there is a constant β max that satisfies β β max let the intermediate variable g be 9 g u β cos φ γ p and there exists a positive constant g max that satisfies g g max then eq 7 is rewritten as 10 y e u sin φ γ p g the cruising speed u and the heading angle φ can be measured and γ p can be calculated by eq 2 hence a reduced order state observer can be constructed to estimate the intermediate variable g according to eq 10 and if g is estimated the estimation of β can be calculated by eq 9 that is 11 β ˆ g ˆ u cos φ γ p where g ˆ and β ˆ are estimations of g and β respectively based on the method of reduced order extended state observer originally proposed in liu et al 2017c a modified reduced order state observer for sideslip angle estimation is directly modeled as follows 12 p k 3 p k 3 2 y e k 3 u sin φ γ p g ˆ p k 3 y e where p is the auxiliary state of the observer k 3 is the gain of the observer let the initial values of the observer be g ˆ t 0 0 and p t 0 k 3 y e t 0 by differentiating the estimation error equation g g ˆ g in combination with eqs 10 and 12 it follows that 13 g g ˆ g k 3 p k 3 2 y e k 3 u sin φ γ p k 3 y e g k 3 g g consider the lyapunov function candidate v 1 g 2 2 if g 0 then v 1 0 the differentiation of v 1 in combination with eq 13 yields 14 v 1 g g k 3 g 2 g g k 3 1 η g 2 k 3 η g 2 g g where 0 η 1 and if g g η k 3 then 15 v 1 k 3 1 η g 2 eq 15 can be rewritten as 16 v 1 t v 1 g g 2 k 3 1 η g 2 g g η k 3 let class k functions α 1 x α 2 x x 2 2 and the continuous positive definite function w x 2 k 3 1 η x 2 according to theorem 4 19 in khalil 2002 subsystem 13 of the reduced order state observer is input to state stable iss with ρ x x η k 3 and there exist class kl function σ and class k function γ that satisfy 17 g σ g 0 t γ g where γ x x η k 3 3 4 guidance law design the desired heading angle is defined by the following guidance law 18 φ d γ p arctan 1 δ y e β ˆ where the angle γ p can be derived from eq 2 the cross tracking error y e is measurable and β ˆ can be obtained from the state observer eq 18 gives 19 sin arctan 1 δ y e β ˆ y e δ β ˆ y e δ β ˆ 2 δ 2 20 cos arctan 1 δ y e β ˆ δ y e δ β ˆ 2 δ 2 substituting them into eq 7 gives 21 y e u y e y e δ β ˆ 2 δ 2 consider another lyapunov function candidate v 2 y e 2 2 if y e 0 then v 2 0 and 22 v 2 u y e 2 y e δ β ˆ 2 δ 2 t t 0 y e t y e t 0 θ according to eq 8 if the cruising speed u is positive and bounded i e 0 u min u u max the look ahead distance δ is bounded i e 0 δ min δ δ max since system 13 is iss β ˆ is bounded and its upper bound is β ˆ max then it follows that 23 v 2 u min y e 2 θ δ max β ˆ max 2 δ max 2 defining 24 μ u min θ δ max β ˆ max 2 δ max 2 0 then eq 23 can be written as v 2 2 μ v 2 according to theorem 4 9 in khalil 2002 the equilibrium point y e 0 of the guidance system is uniformly asymptotically stable notice that the global uniformly asymptotically stable of the guidance system cannot be achieved because the cross tracking error dynamics 6 has been linearized with the premise of a small sideslip angle remark 1 as arctan 1 δ y e β ˆ π 2 π 2 it can be known from eq 18 that φ d γ p π 2 π 2 and cos φ d γ p 0 1 therefore the denominator of 11 is nonzero remark 2 as γ p and a r c t a n 1 δ y e β ˆ are bounded φ d is bounded because φ d is a continuous differentiable and bounded function φ d is bounded and because φ d is a continuous differentiable and bounded function φ d is bounded too 4 heading controller design in this section a heading controller is developed to ensure that the usv s heading angle tracks the desired heading angle quickly and accurately based on the ship s norrbin nonlinear mathematical model fossen 2011 the steering dynamic equation of the usv is represented as 25 φ r r h g δ where δ is the rudder angle and it is the control of the heading controller g is the dynamic coefficient and it is positive when the usv is in linear stable motion i e g 0 h is a nonlinear function of the yaw rate r and h g a 0 a 1 r a 2 r 3 where a 0 a 1 and a 2 are dynamic coefficients it is noted that the ship dynamic coefficients vary as the ship s speed and the external environment since the dynamic surface controller has good robustness the dynamic surface technique is incorporated to design the heading controller defining the heading tracking error as φ e φ φ d then φ e r φ d according to the dynamic surface control technique a virtual control variable α u is introduced and two auxiliary variables are defined z 1 r α u and r k 4 φ e φ d where k 4 is a parameter of the controller to be determined later to avoid multiple differentiations of α u it is defined as the output of a low pass filter of r i e 26 ξ α u α u r α u 0 r 0 where ξ is the time constant of the filter the filtering error z 2 α u r considering both the heading angle tracking error and the filtering error a third lyapunov function candidate is constructed as 27 v 3 φ e 2 2 z 1

following control system the proposed improved integral los guidance law is tested for both curved path tracking and straight line path tracking meanwhile the adaptive integral los guidance law using the look ahead distance adjusted by the tracking error lekkas and fossen 2014 and the conventional integral los guidance law using the constant look ahead distance are also tested and compared with the proposed improved integral los guidance law take a small usv as an example and its size is 110 cm by 36 cm and weighs 5 4 kg the ship s model parameters are taken from liu et al 2017c g 1 525 a 0 0 12 a 1 0 35 and a 2 0 5 in the experiments the sampling time is set to 0 01 s the parameter of the reduced order state observer is set as k 3 2 the parameters of the heading controller are set as ξ 0 3 k 4 1 5 and k 5 50 the curved path following and straight line path following with forward velocities of 1 m s 3 m s and 5 m s are simulated and analyzed respectively for performance comparison of the three guidance laws the same parameters are chosen for the heading controllers and the reduced order state observers of the three control systems more specifically the improved integral los guidance law uses eq 8 for its look ahead distance computation with the parameters k 1 0 8 k 2 0 01 and δ 1 1 the adaptive integral los guidance law uses δ 7 δ 1 e k 2 y e 2 δ 1 for its look ahead distance computation with the same k 2 and δ 1 as the improved integral los guidance the conventional integral los guidance law uses 2 m as its constant look ahead distance in order to investigate the influence of external disturbances on the path following the sideslip angles are set to the same constant during the first 30 s to reflect the constant external disturbances the desired forward velocities are 1 m s 3 m s and 5 m s respectively and the lateral velocities are 0 05 m s after 30 s the system is assumed to be disturbed by the time varying external disturbances and the sideslip angle becomes time varying the variances of the forward velocity and the lateral velocity are 0 01 sin 0 1 t 30 m s and 0 01 s i n 0 1 t 30 m s respectively 5 1 curved path following the first set of experiments use a sinusoidal curve as the desired path and the initial position of the usv is set to 0 20 the curved path following and the tracking errors of the three path following control systems at different speeds are shown in fig 4 all the three guidance laws can guide the usv to the desired path when the desired forward speed is relatively slow for example 1 m s the improved integral los guidance law yields a shortest path for the usv to approach to the desired path then the following is the integral los guidance law with constant look ahead distance and the adaptive integral los guidance law yields the slowest tracking speed when the usv s desired forward speed is increased to 3 m s the integral los guidance law with constant look ahead distance yields a short path for the usv to approach to the desired path this is because its constant look ahead distance is very suitable for this cruising speed in this case the integral los guidance law with constant look ahead distance yields the similar tracking performance as the improved integral los guidance law and the latter one is slightly faster these two guidance laws evidently yield faster tracking speed than the adaptive integral los guidance law when the usv s desired forward speed is increased to 5 m s the improved integral los guidance law is still able to guide the usv to the desired path quickly and without overshoot the path following process of the integral los guidance with constant look ahead distance starts to oscillate the adaptive integral los guidance does not oscillate but the tracking speed is slower than the improved integral los guidance it can be concluded that the improved integral los guidance law proposed in this paper has better performance for path following guidance under different desired forward speeds this is because the improved integral los guidance law considers both the ship s speed and the cross tracking error thus the look ahead distance can be adjusted adaptively to guide the usv to approach the desired path quickly and smoothly at different cruising speeds fig 5 shows the look ahead distances using the three guidance laws in tracking curved path at different speeds as shown in fig 5 the look ahead distance of the integral los guidance law is a constant the look ahead distance of the adaptive integral los guidance law increases with decrease of the cross tracking error until it reaches the maximum value and then remains unchanged the look ahead distance of the improved integral los guidance law is related not only to the cross tracking error but also to the ship s speed in the initial stage of the path tracking the look ahead distances of the adaptive integral los guidance law and the improved integral los guidance law are of little difference and the values are relatively small because of the large cross tracking errors with the increase of time the look ahead distance of the adaptive integral los guidance law increases gradually to its maximum value due to the decrease of the cross tracking error for the improved integral los guidance law the look ahead distance is mainly related to the cross tracking error in the first few seconds of the path following process and it is proportional to the ship s speed in the later stage i e the faster the speed is the larger the look ahead distance is fig 6 shows the desired heading angles and the actual heading angles of the curved path following at different speeds using the improved integral los guidance law it indicates that the heading controller proposed in this paper can make the actual heading angle accurately and quickly track the desired heading angle at different speeds the faster the speed is the faster the desired heading angle adjusts fig 7 shows the rudder angles of the improved integral los path following control system for curved path tracking at different desired speeds the rotation range of the rudder angle is within 35 degrees fig 8 shows the actual sideslip angles and their estimates at different speeds using the improved integral los guidance law in the first 30 s the sideslip angle is a constant and it becomes time varying after 30 s the simulation results indicate that the reduced order state observer proposed in this paper is capable of observing the sideslip angle online the sideslip angle reflects external disturbances because the sideslip angle is estimated and compensated in the guidance law the performance of the path following control system is almost unaffected by the sideslip angle as well as external disturbances it can be observed from fig 4 that when the sideslip angle caused by external disturbances changes at 30 s the performance of the path following control system is almost unaffected 5 2 straight line path following the second set of experiments use a straight line as the desired path and the initial position of usv is set to 0 30 the straight line path following and the tracking errors of the three path following control systems at different speeds are shown in fig 9 similar to the curved path following the usv is able to follow the straight line path by using all three guidance laws with a constant look ahead distance the integral los guidance achieves a short path for the usv to approach to the desired path when it cruises at a right speed if the speed is slow the tracking speed is slow otherwise if the speed is fast the oscillation occurs the look ahead distance of the adaptive integral los guidance law can be adjusted according to the cross tracking error which is independent of the ship s speed although there is no oscillation of the adaptive integral los guidance the tracking speed is slower than the improved integral los guidance especially at a slow cruising speed the look ahead distance of the improved integral los guidance law can be adjusted by both the cross tracking error and the ship s speed and the usv can reach the desired path quickly and smoothly at different speeds the path tracking performance of the improved integral los guidance law is significantly better than those of the other two guidance laws 6 conclusion aiming at solving the problem that usvs track the desired path at certain cruising speeds with the time varying sideslip angle this paper proposes an improved integral los path following control system first in the improved integral los guidance law the look ahead distance can be adjusted adaptively by both the cross tracking error and the ship s speed to adapt to path following at different cruising speeds second the guidance law is cooperated with a reduced order state observer that estimates the sideslip angle online in order to cope with the time varying sideslip angle third the dynamic surface control technique is employed to control the heading the simulation results show that the path following control system based on the improved integral los guidance law can track the desired curved and straight line paths compared to the conventional integral los guidance law and adaptive integral los guidance law the improved integral los guidance law is faster and without overshoot at different cruising speeds credit authorship contribution statement lili wan conceptualization methodology software writing original draft yixin su supervision writing review editing huajun zhang

21904,this paper proposes a path following control system for unmanned surface vehicles usvs based on an improved integral line of sight los guidance law unlike the conventional los guidance law the look ahead distance is designed as a function of the usv s cruising speed and the cross tracking error to adapt to the different cruising speeds of usvs meanwhile a reduced order state observer is developed for online estimation of the time varying sideslip angle caused by external disturbances such as wind wave and current then a heading controller is further designed using the dynamic surface control technique to track the desired heading angle the guidance system and the reduced order state observer subsystem are proved to be uniformly asymptotically stable and input to state stable respectively the simulation results show that the path following control system designed in this paper can track the desired curved and straight line paths quickly and smoothly at different cruising speeds keywords line of sight unmanned surface vehicle path following look ahead distance reduced order state observer dynamic surface control 1 introduction unmanned surface vehicles usvs have been broadly applied in both military and civilian fields they have become a hot research area in the field of intelligent marine equipment research during recent years liu et al 2016c shi et al 2019 wan et al 2019 in the ever changing uncertain marine environment the ability to accurately quickly and smoothly track the desired path is one of the key technologies to ensure the safety and accomplishment of the usv missions zhang et al 2018 2017 numerous researches have been reported on the path following control of usvs liu et al 2016c usv is a typical underactuated system and there are a set of unintegral second order non holonomic constraints in the system therefore there are certain limitations in using conventional linear methods to achieve path following control wan et al 2018 for nonlinear control methods of path following the lyapunov stability theory is popularly used for the control law design in zhang and zhang 2015 a dynamic virtual ship dvs guidance principle was proposed which used a virtual ship to generate a reference path and then incorporated the neural network and dynamic surface control technique to track the desired trajectory in do and pan 2004 a state and output feedback controller based on the lyapunov direct method and backstepping method was introduced to address the effects caused by external disturbances a nonlinear observer was also introduced to estimate the yaw rate and the roll rate in liang et al 2018 the backstepping the sliding mode control technique and the fuzzy control were further combined to design an adaptive robust path following controller based on the virtual guidance method in miao et al 2017b the backstepping was used to decompose the path following control into two parts the kinematics control and the dynamics control and then the linear extended observer was incorporated to estimate the uncertainties in liao et al 2015 and zhang and zhang 2014 adaptive sliding mode path following controllers based on the backstepping technique were proposed in do 2016 the backstepping technique and the lyapunov direct method were employed to realize the path following of underactuated ships these methods are all direct path following control based on mathematical models however the design of these controllers is complicated due to the usv s complex nonlinearity and uncertainty characteristics in order to simplify the design of the controller the underactuated usv path following control system can be regarded as two parts the guidance subsystem and the control subsystem after acquiring path information and environment information the guidance subsystem generates reference signals for the control subsystem and the control subsystem tracks the reference signals generated by the guidance subsystem so as to realize path following the typical guidance methods are light of sight los guidance pure pursuit guidance vector field guidance constant bearing guidance and so on breivik and fossen 2009 in park et al 2018 the pure pursuit approach was used to design the path following system of autonomous vehicles in xu and guedes soares 2016 a way point scheme based on a vector field algorithm was used to obtain the guidance system for path following of surface marine vessels a time varying vector field guidance law for path following control of autonomous vessels was presented in xu et al 2019 the pure pursuit guidance and vector field guidance are also widely used in the path following of unmanned aerial vehicles yamasaki et al 2009 wilhelm and clem 2019 and unmanned ground vehicles cho et al 2015 the los guidance was firstly combined with the sliding mode control to achieve the path following control of the autonomous underwater vehicles by healey and lienard 1993 the los guidance has low sensitivity to high frequency noises and requires fewer design parameters its principle is independent of the dynamic control and does not rely upon the mathematical model of the system instead it assumes that the desired heading angle can be determined by the ship s real time position and the desired path therefore it is widely used in path following control chen et al 2019 børhaug et al 2011 moreira et al 2007 do et al 2004 a class of proportional los guidance system has been proved to be uniformly semi globally exponentially stable fossen and pettersen 2014 the los guidance has been combined with a set of other technologies for usv path following for example it was combined with the dynamic surface control and the neural network to design the path following controller liu et al 2017a it was combined with the model predictive control technique to achieve path following for underactuated usvs liu et al 2018 it was also combined with the active disturbance rejection sliding mode control technique li et al 2013 and fuzzy logic khaled and chalhoub 2013 mu et al 2018 to achieve path following however the los guidance is vulnerable to the external disturbance that results in deviation problems especially in tracking curved paths børhaug et al 2008 the integral los guidance law increases the robustness of the system fossen and lekkas 2017 and it was employed to achieve the path following for surface ships and underwater vehicles with constant current disturbances caharija et al 2016 it had been proven that the closed loop system is globally uniformly asymptotically stable as well as locally uniformly exponentially stable considering the disturbance factor the integral los guidance law was used to realize the path following of underwater snake like robots with constant wave disturbances kelasidi et al 2017 in addition an oceanic current observer was designed to estimate the external current disturbance in belleter et al 2019 moreover an adaptive los guidance law was proposed in fossen et al 2015 for online estimation of the current disturbance as a constant these methods take the influence of the external current disturbance into consideration but handle the disturbance as a constant in reality however the current disturbance is time varying hence the sideslip angle resulted from the current disturbance is also time varying to deal with the time varying sideslip angle a predictor for online estimation of the time varying sideslip angle was designed in liu et al 2016b a bounded gain forgetting adaptive estimator was designed to predict the time varying sideslip angle and compensate it in wang et al 2019 combined with the los guidance these methods achieve path following for the ship in addition a los path following control method with error constraints was proposed in zheng et al 2018 neural networks and predictors were further combined to estimate the system uncertainty and external disturbances liu et al 2016a a reduced order extended state observer was designed for online estimation of the time varying sideslip angle caused by external disturbances and the los guidance law with error constraints was proposed in liu et al 2017c a finite time disturbance observer for online computation of the time varying sideslip angle was proposed in wang et al 2018b a state observer that estimates the state of the usv and the external disturbance online was presented in liu et al 2019 and the observer error dynamics is input output stable a linear state observer was used for online estimation of the unknown sideslip angle and an adaptive los guidance law was then designed in miao et al 2017a these methods all use a constant look ahead distance when applying the los guidance to achieve more flexible maneuverability and approach to the desired path faster the look ahead distance was designed as a function of the cross tracking error so as to improve the los guidance law lekkas and fossen 2014 the monotonic cubic hermite spline interpolation technique was used to design the path the resultant cascade system consisting of the improved los guidance system and the heading control system is k exponentially stable the look ahead distance was also designed as a function of the cross tracking error in liu et al 2017b and it was then combined with the backstepping method to design the steering controller in order to achieve path following the influence of the ship s speed on path following was further considered in wang et al 2018a the ship s cruising speed was designed as a function of the cross tracking error to increase the robustness and flexibility of the system this paper takes one step further with consideration of the cruising speed of the ship this paper proposes an improved integral los guidance law with the look ahead distance being designed as a function of both the cross tracking error and the cruising speed of the ship the objective is to dispose of the path following at different speeds in addition a state observer is integrated into the los guidance to estimate the time varying sideslip angle the improved integral los guidance law is then used to determine the desired heading angle and a heading controller is further designed by using the dynamic surface control technique to track the desired heading angle and realize the path following eventually the block diagram of the path following system is shown in fig 1 the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the problem formulation of the los guidance for the usv section 3 presents the improved integral los guidance law and analyses the stability of the guidance system section 4 introduces the design of the usv s heading controller using the dynamic surface control technique section 5 presents the simulation results of the proposed path following control system finally section 6 concludes this paper 2 problem formulation an underactuated usv travels at a speed of u and its forward and lateral velocities are u and v respectively then u u 2 v 2 let the position of the usv in the earth fixed reference frame be x y its three degrees of freedom kinematic equations can be represented as fossen 2011 1 x u cos φ v sin φ y u sin φ v cos φ φ r where φ is the heading angle and r is the yaw rate the geometric representation of the los guided usv path following is shown in fig 2 the projection of the usv s position x y on the reference path is x p ω y p ω where ω is a positive path variable and the desired path p ω consisting of a series of waypoints is a non closed path the clockwise rotation angle of the path tangential reference frame at the point x p ω y p ω relative to the earth fixed reference frame is 2 γ p atan 2 y p ω x p ω where x p ω x p ω ω y p ω y p ω ω and the path variable ω satisfies ω u x p ω 2 y p ω 2 0 fossen 2011 the path tracking error in the path tangential reference frame is represented as 3 x e y e cos γ p sin γ p sin γ p cos γ p t x x p ω y y p ω because x p ω y p ω is the projection point of the usv s position coordinates x y on the reference path x e 0 then the cross tracking error is rewritten as 4 y e x x p ω sin γ p y y p ω cos γ p in order to realize path following of the usv the following two key issues need to be addressed 1 selecting an appropriate look ahead distance δ as well as the controller parameters to get the desired heading angle φ d so that lim t y e ε 1 on kinematics 2 designing the control δ so that lim t φ φ d ε 2 on kinetics where ε 1 and ε 2 are very small positive numbers 3 improved integral los guidance design and analysis 3 1 dynamic equation of the tracking error the following equation is derived by differentiating eq 4 with eqs 2 and 3 5 y e x x p ω sin γ p y y p ω cos γ p x x p ω cos γ p y y p ω sin γ p x e 0 x sin γ p y cos γ p substituting eq 1 into eq 5 we have 6 y e u cos φ v sin φ sin γ p u sin φ v cos φ cos γ p u sin φ β γ p u sin χ γ p where β atan 2 v u is the sideslip angle χ is the course angle since the ship is affected by external disturbances such as wind wave and current the heading angle and the course angle are often not equal and they satisfy χ φ β in general the sideslip angle β is non zero and time varying and the sideslip angle is quite small under normal operation usually less than 5 degrees hence it is reasonably approximated as sin β β and cos β 1 eq 6 then becomes 7 y e u sin φ γ p u β cos φ γ p 3 2 look ahead distance computation the look ahead distance determines the performance of the usv path following control system excessive look ahead distance will result in too slow tracking speed while too small look ahead distance will increase system overshoot the look ahead distance computation must consider both the ship s speed and the cross tracking error when the cross tracking error is relatively large a small look ahead distance should be selected to approach to the desired path quickly regardless of the cruising speed as the cross tracking error decreases it is necessary to increase the look ahead distance according to the ship s cruising speed when the cruising speed is relatively fast the look ahead distance needs to be quickly increased to a large value to reduce overshoot in this way the usv is able to smoothly approach to the desired path on the other side when the cruising speed is relatively slow the look ahead distance can be increased slowly so that the usv can approach to the desired path with a short trajectory based on these guidelines the look ahead distance is designed as a function of the ship s cruising speed and the cross tracking error 8 δ k 1 u δ 1 e k 2 y e 2 δ 1 where k 1 and k 2 are controller parameters that satisfy k 1 0 and k 2 0 δ 1 is the minimum look ahead distance when the speed factor is not included let k 1 0 8 k 2 0 01 and δ 1 1 the correlations between the cross tracking errors and the look ahead distances at different speeds are shown in fig 3 it shows that the look ahead distance is mainly determined by the cross tracking error when the cross tracking error is large the larger the cross tracking error is the smaller look ahead distance is when the cross tracking error becomes very large the look ahead distance is δ 1 and the usv approaches to the desired path with a short path as the cross tracking error decreases the influence of the cruising speed on the look ahead distance gradually increases when the cross tracking error is small enough and close to zero the look ahead distance is proportional to the cruising speed the faster the ship cruises the larger look ahead distance is obtained in order to reduce the overshoot the slower the ship cruises the smaller the look ahead distance is obtained in order to approach to the desired path with a shorter path 3 3 reduced order state observer design due to the existence of external disturbances such as the wind wave and current the sideslip angle is time varying it is difficult to accurately measure the sideslip angle in applications the sideslip angle has a significant influence on the path following accuracy and may even affect the stability of the entire path following control system it must be compensated properly to avoid deviating from the desired path of the usv the reduced order state observer has a simple structure and it can estimate the internal state variables of the system according to the input and output of the system in this section a reduced order state observer is introduced for online estimation of the sideslip angle since the sideslip angle is relatively small it is reasonable to assume it has an upper bound i e there is a constant β max that satisfies β β max let the intermediate variable g be 9 g u β cos φ γ p and there exists a positive constant g max that satisfies g g max then eq 7 is rewritten as 10 y e u sin φ γ p g the cruising speed u and the heading angle φ can be measured and γ p can be calculated by eq 2 hence a reduced order state observer can be constructed to estimate the intermediate variable g according to eq 10 and if g is estimated the estimation of β can be calculated by eq 9 that is 11 β ˆ g ˆ u cos φ γ p where g ˆ and β ˆ are estimations of g and β respectively based on the method of reduced order extended state observer originally proposed in liu et al 2017c a modified reduced order state observer for sideslip angle estimation is directly modeled as follows 12 p k 3 p k 3 2 y e k 3 u sin φ γ p g ˆ p k 3 y e where p is the auxiliary state of the observer k 3 is the gain of the observer let the initial values of the observer be g ˆ t 0 0 and p t 0 k 3 y e t 0 by differentiating the estimation error equation g g ˆ g in combination with eqs 10 and 12 it follows that 13 g g ˆ g k 3 p k 3 2 y e k 3 u sin φ γ p k 3 y e g k 3 g g consider the lyapunov function candidate v 1 g 2 2 if g 0 then v 1 0 the differentiation of v 1 in combination with eq 13 yields 14 v 1 g g k 3 g 2 g g k 3 1 η g 2 k 3 η g 2 g g where 0 η 1 and if g g η k 3 then 15 v 1 k 3 1 η g 2 eq 15 can be rewritten as 16 v 1 t v 1 g g 2 k 3 1 η g 2 g g η k 3 let class k functions α 1 x α 2 x x 2 2 and the continuous positive definite function w x 2 k 3 1 η x 2 according to theorem 4 19 in khalil 2002 subsystem 13 of the reduced order state observer is input to state stable iss with ρ x x η k 3 and there exist class kl function σ and class k function γ that satisfy 17 g σ g 0 t γ g where γ x x η k 3 3 4 guidance law design the desired heading angle is defined by the following guidance law 18 φ d γ p arctan 1 δ y e β ˆ where the angle γ p can be derived from eq 2 the cross tracking error y e is measurable and β ˆ can be obtained from the state observer eq 18 gives 19 sin arctan 1 δ y e β ˆ y e δ β ˆ y e δ β ˆ 2 δ 2 20 cos arctan 1 δ y e β ˆ δ y e δ β ˆ 2 δ 2 substituting them into eq 7 gives 21 y e u y e y e δ β ˆ 2 δ 2 consider another lyapunov function candidate v 2 y e 2 2 if y e 0 then v 2 0 and 22 v 2 u y e 2 y e δ β ˆ 2 δ 2 t t 0 y e t y e t 0 θ according to eq 8 if the cruising speed u is positive and bounded i e 0 u min u u max the look ahead distance δ is bounded i e 0 δ min δ δ max since system 13 is iss β ˆ is bounded and its upper bound is β ˆ max then it follows that 23 v 2 u min y e 2 θ δ max β ˆ max 2 δ max 2 defining 24 μ u min θ δ max β ˆ max 2 δ max 2 0 then eq 23 can be written as v 2 2 μ v 2 according to theorem 4 9 in khalil 2002 the equilibrium point y e 0 of the guidance system is uniformly asymptotically stable notice that the global uniformly asymptotically stable of the guidance system cannot be achieved because the cross tracking error dynamics 6 has been linearized with the premise of a small sideslip angle remark 1 as arctan 1 δ y e β ˆ π 2 π 2 it can be known from eq 18 that φ d γ p π 2 π 2 and cos φ d γ p 0 1 therefore the denominator of 11 is nonzero remark 2 as γ p and a r c t a n 1 δ y e β ˆ are bounded φ d is bounded because φ d is a continuous differentiable and bounded function φ d is bounded and because φ d is a continuous differentiable and bounded function φ d is bounded too 4 heading controller design in this section a heading controller is developed to ensure that the usv s heading angle tracks the desired heading angle quickly and accurately based on the ship s norrbin nonlinear mathematical model fossen 2011 the steering dynamic equation of the usv is represented as 25 φ r r h g δ where δ is the rudder angle and it is the control of the heading controller g is the dynamic coefficient and it is positive when the usv is in linear stable motion i e g 0 h is a nonlinear function of the yaw rate r and h g a 0 a 1 r a 2 r 3 where a 0 a 1 and a 2 are dynamic coefficients it is noted that the ship dynamic coefficients vary as the ship s speed and the external environment since the dynamic surface controller has good robustness the dynamic surface technique is incorporated to design the heading controller defining the heading tracking error as φ e φ φ d then φ e r φ d according to the dynamic surface control technique a virtual control variable α u is introduced and two auxiliary variables are defined z 1 r α u and r k 4 φ e φ d where k 4 is a parameter of the controller to be determined later to avoid multiple differentiations of α u it is defined as the output of a low pass filter of r i e 26 ξ α u α u r α u 0 r 0 where ξ is the time constant of the filter the filtering error z 2 α u r considering both the heading angle tracking error and the filtering error a third lyapunov function candidate is constructed as 27 v 3 φ e 2 2 z 1

following control system the proposed improved integral los guidance law is tested for both curved path tracking and straight line path tracking meanwhile the adaptive integral los guidance law using the look ahead distance adjusted by the tracking error lekkas and fossen 2014 and the conventional integral los guidance law using the constant look ahead distance are also tested and compared with the proposed improved integral los guidance law take a small usv as an example and its size is 110 cm by 36 cm and weighs 5 4 kg the ship s model parameters are taken from liu et al 2017c g 1 525 a 0 0 12 a 1 0 35 and a 2 0 5 in the experiments the sampling time is set to 0 01 s the parameter of the reduced order state observer is set as k 3 2 the parameters of the heading controller are set as ξ 0 3 k 4 1 5 and k 5 50 the curved path following and straight line path following with forward velocities of 1 m s 3 m s and 5 m s are simulated and analyzed respectively for performance comparison of the three guidance laws the same parameters are chosen for the heading controllers and the reduced order state observers of the three control systems more specifically the improved integral los guidance law uses eq 8 for its look ahead distance computation with the parameters k 1 0 8 k 2 0 01 and δ 1 1 the adaptive integral los guidance law uses δ 7 δ 1 e k 2 y e 2 δ 1 for its look ahead distance computation with the same k 2 and δ 1 as the improved integral los guidance the conventional integral los guidance law uses 2 m as its constant look ahead distance in order to investigate the influence of external disturbances on the path following the sideslip angles are set to the same constant during the first 30 s to reflect the constant external disturbances the desired forward velocities are 1 m s 3 m s and 5 m s respectively and the lateral velocities are 0 05 m s after 30 s the system is assumed to be disturbed by the time varying external disturbances and the sideslip angle becomes time varying the variances of the forward velocity and the lateral velocity are 0 01 sin 0 1 t 30 m s and 0 01 s i n 0 1 t 30 m s respectively 5 1 curved path following the first set of experiments use a sinusoidal curve as the desired path and the initial position of the usv is set to 0 20 the curved path following and the tracking errors of the three path following control systems at different speeds are shown in fig 4 all the three guidance laws can guide the usv to the desired path when the desired forward speed is relatively slow for example 1 m s the improved integral los guidance law yields a shortest path for the usv to approach to the desired path then the following is the integral los guidance law with constant look ahead distance and the adaptive integral los guidance law yields the slowest tracking speed when the usv s desired forward speed is increased to 3 m s the integral los guidance law with constant look ahead distance yields a short path for the usv to approach to the desired path this is because its constant look ahead distance is very suitable for this cruising speed in this case the integral los guidance law with constant look ahead distance yields the similar tracking performance as the improved integral los guidance law and the latter one is slightly faster these two guidance laws evidently yield faster tracking speed than the adaptive integral los guidance law when the usv s desired forward speed is increased to 5 m s the improved integral los guidance law is still able to guide the usv to the desired path quickly and without overshoot the path following process of the integral los guidance with constant look ahead distance starts to oscillate the adaptive integral los guidance does not oscillate but the tracking speed is slower than the improved integral los guidance it can be concluded that the improved integral los guidance law proposed in this paper has better performance for path following guidance under different desired forward speeds this is because the improved integral los guidance law considers both the ship s speed and the cross tracking error thus the look ahead distance can be adjusted adaptively to guide the usv to approach the desired path quickly and smoothly at different cruising speeds fig 5 shows the look ahead distances using the three guidance laws in tracking curved path at different speeds as shown in fig 5 the look ahead distance of the integral los guidance law is a constant the look ahead distance of the adaptive integral los guidance law increases with decrease of the cross tracking error until it reaches the maximum value and then remains unchanged the look ahead distance of the improved integral los guidance law is related not only to the cross tracking error but also to the ship s speed in the initial stage of the path tracking the look ahead distances of the adaptive integral los guidance law and the improved integral los guidance law are of little difference and the values are relatively small because of the large cross tracking errors with the increase of time the look ahead distance of the adaptive integral los guidance law increases gradually to its maximum value due to the decrease of the cross tracking error for the improved integral los guidance law the look ahead distance is mainly related to the cross tracking error in the first few seconds of the path following process and it is proportional to the ship s speed in the later stage i e the faster the speed is the larger the look ahead distance is fig 6 shows the desired heading angles and the actual heading angles of the curved path following at different speeds using the improved integral los guidance law it indicates that the heading controller proposed in this paper can make the actual heading angle accurately and quickly track the desired heading angle at different speeds the faster the speed is the faster the desired heading angle adjusts fig 7 shows the rudder angles of the improved integral los path following control system for curved path tracking at different desired speeds the rotation range of the rudder angle is within 35 degrees fig 8 shows the actual sideslip angles and their estimates at different speeds using the improved integral los guidance law in the first 30 s the sideslip angle is a constant and it becomes time varying after 30 s the simulation results indicate that the reduced order state observer proposed in this paper is capable of observing the sideslip angle online the sideslip angle reflects external disturbances because the sideslip angle is estimated and compensated in the guidance law the performance of the path following control system is almost unaffected by the sideslip angle as well as external disturbances it can be observed from fig 4 that when the sideslip angle caused by external disturbances changes at 30 s the performance of the path following control system is almost unaffected 5 2 straight line path following the second set of experiments use a straight line as the desired path and the initial position of usv is set to 0 30 the straight line path following and the tracking errors of the three path following control systems at different speeds are shown in fig 9 similar to the curved path following the usv is able to follow the straight line path by using all three guidance laws with a constant look ahead distance the integral los guidance achieves a short path for the usv to approach to the desired path when it cruises at a right speed if the speed is slow the tracking speed is slow otherwise if the speed is fast the oscillation occurs the look ahead distance of the adaptive integral los guidance law can be adjusted according to the cross tracking error which is independent of the ship s speed although there is no oscillation of the adaptive integral los guidance the tracking speed is slower than the improved integral los guidance especially at a slow cruising speed the look ahead distance of the improved integral los guidance law can be adjusted by both the cross tracking error and the ship s speed and the usv can reach the desired path quickly and smoothly at different speeds the path tracking performance of the improved integral los guidance law is significantly better than those of the other two guidance laws 6 conclusion aiming at solving the problem that usvs track the desired path at certain cruising speeds with the time varying sideslip angle this paper proposes an improved integral los path following control system first in the improved integral los guidance law the look ahead distance can be adjusted adaptively by both the cross tracking error and the ship s speed to adapt to path following at different cruising speeds second the guidance law is cooperated with a reduced order state observer that estimates the sideslip angle online in order to cope with the time varying sideslip angle third the dynamic surface control technique is employed to control the heading the simulation results show that the path following control system based on the improved integral los guidance law can track the desired curved and straight line paths compared to the conventional integral los guidance law and adaptive integral los guidance law the improved integral los guidance law is faster and without overshoot at different cruising speeds credit authorship contribution statement lili wan conceptualization methodology software writing original draft yixin su supervision writing review editing huajun zhang
