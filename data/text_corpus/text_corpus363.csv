1815,preferential flow is a widespread process in unsaturated soil and it is important to incorporate preferential flow in mathematical and numerical models to accurately predict subsurface flow and solute transport in this study we conduct experiments to relate the fraction of fingering flow f with water flux qs and average active water saturation s e which is a key constitutive relation in modeling subsurface preferential flow infiltration experiments were conducted in a two dimensional transparent slab chamber with different soil grain sizes and initial water saturation available experimental data from the literature are also compiled and compared with our new data results show that the f qs relationship is independent on grain size of the soil and whether the sand is initially dry or wet the exponent of the f qs relationship a0 varies in a small range 0 39 0 48 and the exponent of the f s e relationship γ can be predicted from a0 and soil grain size the richards equation was combined with the f qs relationship to model the preferential flow experiments the results show that the constitutive relationship successfully predicts preferential flow velocity in unsaturated soil keywords preferential flow fingering fraction unsaturated soil data availability the raw data are available in the supplementary file 1 introduction it has long been realized that preferential flow is a widespread and even more common form of flow in natural unsaturated soils beven and germann 2013 clothier et al 2007 dicarlo 2013 preferential flow bypasses most of the soils and results in rapid propagation of contaminants to significant depths flury et al 1994 with large impacts on groundwater quality preferential flow not only occurs due to heterogenous soil properties but also exists in homogeneous soils with water flowing in finger shaped pathways rather than with a uniform wetting front which is referred to as fingering flow de rooij 2000 glass et al 1989a the physics that controls fingering flow has been studied extensively at both pore and continuum scales detailed pore scale studies on the fingering phenomena have improved our understanding on the mechanism through which finger flow forms e g through saturation overshooting geiger and durnford 2000 at the continuum scale efforts have been made to extend the classic richards equation to incorporate fingering flow in continuum scale models which can be used for field simulations van duijn et al 2004 the active region model arm proposed by liu et al 2005 provides a conceptually straightforward way to incorporate fingering flow within the richards framework in the model a representative element volume is divided into active and inactive regions with flow only through the active region fig 1 the main idea of arm is that the fraction of active region f can change with water flux qs or average active water saturation s e the effective saturation within the finger zone is defined as 1 s a θ a θ r θ s θ r where θ a is the volumetric water content in fingers and θ s and θ r are saturated and residual volumetric water contents the average active water saturation s e is linked to s a through 2 s e f s a by providing a constitutive relationship between f and qs or between f and s e the richards equation can be used to model fingering flow at the continuum scale liu et al 2005 obtained a relationship between the fingering fraction f and average active water saturation s e based on fractal flow patterns 3 f s e γ where the exponent γ is a key parameter for the active region model with a value between 0 and 1 liu 2011 2017 proposed that the fingering fraction f could be alternatively related to water flux q s 4 f q s k s a 0 where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and a 0 is a parameter between 0 and 1 the above result was developed based on the optimality principle that unsaturated water flows in such a way that the total water flow resistance is at its minimum liu 2011 2017 argued that conventional unsaturated flow theories are based on a local equilibrium assumption and could not be used for modeling large scale fingering flow in which water within fingers and non fingering zones is obviously not in equilibrium and thus developed a macroscopic theory for fingering flow characterized by eq 4 furthermore eq 4 was shown be essentially equivalent to eq 3 for gravitational fingering flow liu 2011 2017 also noted that laboratory observations seem to suggest that a 0 is 0 5 for some soils wang et al 1998 but could not theoretically conclude that if that value is a universal constant for different types of soils one major objective of this work is to experimentally examine how a0 varies with soil types other forms of relationships between f and flow parameters of soils have also been proposed by scholars baker and hillel 1990 glass et al 1989b in glass et al 1989b an empirical relationship was proposed based on fitting of experimental data where 5 f 0 0765 0 9018 q s k s this relationship is similar to eq 4 with a0 being 0 5 except that there is a small intercept of f at zero flux baker and hillel 1990 related f to the water flux qs and the unsaturated conductivity of the soil 6 f q s k u ψ e where ψ e is the effective water entry suction which in turn is a function of grain size distribution the above equation was derived based on the assumption that the water flow occurs only in fingers and all the water potential is ψ e currently there is no consensus on what f should be related to and what the exact relationship is in this study we conduct fingering flow experiments to test the relationships mentioned above and evaluate the values of the parameters in these relationships γ and a0 available experimental data from the literature are compiled and compared with our new data we demonstrate how the richards equation can be combined with our constitutive relationship to model the fingering flow experiments 2 experimental method and materials a two dimensional transparent slab chamber similar to that in glass et al 1989b was constructed for the infiltration experiments the chamber is 36 cm wide 40 cm tall and 1 cm thick fig 2 the upper and lower boundaries are open to the atmosphere the experimental system consists of a layer of fine sand overlying a layer of coarse sand the flux of water is controlled by the thickness of the top fine layer and fingers form in the coarse sand layer clay type ⅰ and ⅱ 180 250 μm sand and multi layer expansive sponge were used for the top fine layer the saturated hydraulic conductivity of clay ⅰ clay ⅱ and 180 250 μm sand are 1 48 10 2 cm min 1 07 10 3 cm min and 2 06 cm min respectively the experimental sand used in the fingering zone were chinese ios standard sand with the size of 20 30 and 30 40 mesh pore size 850 600 μm and 600 425 μm to remove impurities on the surface of sand grains all the sand was boiled in a 0 5 solution of glass cleanser for 0 5 to 0 75 h then rinsed 15 times with warm tap water boiled in tap water for another 15 min sieved under tap water for 1 min rinsed 5 times with distilled water and finally dried at 60 the experimental sands were uniformly filled in the slab chamber layer by layer through a sieve after filling with sand the chamber was lifted 1 5 cm high and dropped 200 times to make the sand dense enough a thin piece of cotton cloth was placed on top of the sand layer and finally the fine layer was placed at the beginning of each experiment distilled water was added evenly across the top of the fine layer up to 1 5 cm water infiltrated through the two layers and flowed out from the bottom of the experimental sand to an open drainage space fingers formed in the coarse sand layer and the fraction of the fingering zone was estimated by image analysis of the finger distribution when the fingers were stable e g fig 3 the water flux was measured by monitoring the amount of infiltrated water with time after each experiment the slab chamber was laid horizontally and opened from the front side the water saturation in the fingers were measured by weighing the soil samples before and after drying after rinsing with distilled water and drying at 60 the sand was refilled into the slab chamber for new experiments with difference water fluxes table 1 a separate group of experiments were conducted where the steady state fingering distribution was not terminated a new steady state fingering distribution was established by increasing water flux on top of the previous finger configuration this was achieved by using a multi layer expansive sponge for the top layer which was taken out layer by layer to increase flow flux this approach was different from the other experiments in that the new fingers formed on top of previously existing fingers whereas in the other individual experiments the fingers formed in initially dry sands 3 experimental results 3 1 fraction of fingering zone and water flux the detailed experimental results are given in the appendix tables s1 s3 where the first two groups of experiments were conducted with initially dry sands and in the third group fingers formed on top of existing fingers by increasing water flux fig 3 shows example distributions of fingers in the sand at different water flux conditions from the first group of experiments additional images for the other two groups of experiments can be found in the appendix it can be observed that flow fingers occupy larger fractions of the soil with increasing water flux consistent with predictions from eq 4 additional data were extracted from glass et al 1989b and baker and hillel 1990 glass et al 1989b obtained a relationship between f and q s k s which was f 0 0765 0 9018 q s k s with the least square best fit coefficient r 2 0 9552 their data are refit with eq 4 and the result is a 0 0 44 and r 2 0 9384 data from both glass et al 1989b and baker and hillel 1990 are compiled in table 2 compiling data from our three experimental groups with varying grain sizes and experimental methods and the two sets of experimental data from glass et al 1989b and baker and hillel 1990 shows that the value of a 0 varies within a small range from 0 39 to 0 48 and an a 0 value of 0 43 fits all five experimental datasets fig 4 and table 3 there is no apparent correlation between the value of a 0 and grain size suggesting that the grain size of the sand does not modify the f qs relationship the f qs relationship is also independent on whether the sand is initially dry or there are existing fingers before new fingers form 3 2 fraction of fingering zone and water saturation the available data on finger fraction f and water saturation s e in the literature and from this study are shown in tables 3 and 4 and fig 5 using the data in glass et al 1989b and baker and hillel 1990 the fitted γ values are 0 91 and 0 60 respectively our new experimental data with 20 30 and 30 40 mesh sands suggest that γ 0 62 and γ 0 71 respectively water saturation was not measured in our third group of experiments because the experiments were conducted continuously and not terminated for water saturation measurements the data suggest that there is a larger variation in the value of γ 0 60 0 91 compared to that for a 0 0 39 0 48 liu 2022 presents the relationship between γ and a 0 in gravity dominated conditions 7 a 0 γ β 1 γ γ where β is a parameter in the brooks corey relation related to pore size distribution the values of β are 3 5 4 0 in our experiments for the 20 30 and 30 40 mesh sands using the value of a 0 0 43 the calculated γ are 0 75 and 0 72 based on eq 7 which are close to the experimental values 0 71 and 0 62 field scale experiments also show that the value of γ varies from 0 618 to 0 788 sheng et al 2009 similar to the values observed in this study the field scale experiments are different from the laboratory experiments presented in this study and in glass et al 1989b and baker and hillel 1990 in that no steady states are reached in the field experiments the soil is infiltrated with dye containing water and the distribution of fingers are mapped after infiltration is stopped nevertheless the average active water saturations and fingering fractions can be measured for the loam and silty clay used in sheng et al 2009 the values of β are around 4 1 and 3 9 brooks 1965 and using a 0 0 43 the calculated γ values are 0 76 and 0 75 consistent with the reported values in sheng et al 2009 4 numerical simulation 4 1 governing equations in section 3 we show that an a0 value of 0 43 is sufficient to capture all experimental data and can be used in models when no information is available the constitutive relationship between f and qs can be combined with the richards equation to model preferential flow in porous media in this section we test whether this approach can reproduce the time evolution of water saturation in our experiments the governing equation for fingering flow in unsaturated soil is sheng et al 2011 8 f θ a t z d a θ a f θ a z f k a θ a z θ i f t where θ a is the volumetric water content within the fingering region θ i is the volumetric water content of the inactive region d a θ a k a θ a ψ θ a is the hydraulic diffusivity within the fingering region ψ is water head k a is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity within the fingering region z is distance below the surface and t is time typically the hydraulic diffusivity can be fitted as a function of water content 9 d a θ a a e b θ a where a and b are fitting parameters the water flux in the fingering region q f can be expressed as follows according to the darcy buckingham law 10 q f d a θ a θ a z k a θ a the effective saturation within the finger zone is defined as 11 s a θ a θ r θ s θ r where θ s and θ r are saturated and residual volumetric water contents k a can be calculated by the van genuchten permeability relation 12 k a s a k s s a 1 2 1 1 s a 1 m m 2 where k s is saturated hydraulic conductivity and m is a fitting parameter hydraulic parameters of the sands used in our experiments and in modeling are shown in table 5 the saturated conductivity was measured using the constant head method brooks 1965 the sand bulk density was determined by measuring the mass and volume of sand in the slab chamber the values of the van genuchten parameter m and α were from baker and hillel 1990 the parameters a and b were estimated using horizontal imbibition experiments bruce and klute 1956 all measurements were repeated several times and the average values were calculated 4 2 modeling results we used the relationship between f and qs with an a0 value of 0 43 to simulate the time evolution of water saturation in our experiments the governing equation was solved using an implicit finite difference scheme fig 6 a shows the distribution of simulated water content θ a at different time with q s k s 0 222 the wetting front moves downward with time with a constant velocity and the water wet zone has a constant steady state water saturation fig 6b shows the distribution of water content at the end of 1 min with q s k s varying from 0 009 to 0 781 the steady state water saturation increases with increasing q s k s and the wetting front travels faster with larger q s k to illustrate how including the f qs relation affects fluid flow we show in fig 7 modeling results of a specific experiment assuming uniform flow f 1 in comparison with the results with the f qs relationship implemented it is shown that failure to consider fingering flow underestimates the steady state water saturation θ a and the travel velocity of the wetting front v p fig 8 a d compiles all simulated steady state water saturations and travel velocities of the wetting front assuming fingering flow and uniform flow separately for the 20 30 and 30 40 mesh sand the water mass balance equation between the fine and coarse layers dictates that 13 q s f q f f v p θ a where qf is the water flux in the fingering zone and v p is the pore flow velocity with f smaller than 1 in fingering flow both v p and θ a are larger than in uniform flow our simulated v p and θ a with independently determined hydraulic parameters of the soil are in good agreement with measured values suggesting that the modeling approach used in this study can reproduce fingering flow successfully 5 discussion 5 1 other proposed f qs relationships in the literature hill and parlange 1972 first presented a simple criterion for predicting fingering flow in horizontally layered systems according to hill and parlange 1972 fingering flow occurs when the flux of water is less than the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the coarse sand layer q s k s 1 however hillel and baker 1988 suggested that the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s in the criterion should be replaced by the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at the water entry value k u ψ e baker and hillel 1990 proposed that fingering fraction f could be predicted by eq 6 based on baker and hillel 1990 the water entry pressure head ψ e is highly correlated with the median grain size of the porous medium for air dry sands this empirical relationship is given as baker and hillel 1990 14 ψ e 4 37 d 1 0 074 where ψ e is the water entry suction in cm and d is the median grain diameter in mm this means that for given porous medium the value of k u ψ e is fixed by its median grain diameter combining eq 6 and 13 it is predicted that 15 q f k u ψ e eq 15 suggests that with the increase of q s the flow velocity in the fingering zone q f is fixed at k u ψ e and the increase of q s and f are proportional we estimate that the median grain diameters of the sands used in our experiments are 675 μm and 477 5 μm for the 20 30 and 30 40 mesh sands according to the van genuchten model the k u ψ e values are 0 22 k s and 0 31 k s respectively here the k s values are for the 20 30 and 30 40 sands respectively fig 9 fig 9 shows the relationship between q f and q s k s observed in our experiments it is shown that the finger velocity q f increases with increasing q s rather than staying constant at k u ψ e our proposed relationship between f and qs is fundamentally different with that in baker and hillel 1990 in that in eq 13 both f and qf increase with increasing qs while in the relation in baker and hillel 1990 only f increases with qs while qf is constant the relation in eq 6 also requires that qs k u ψ e for the initiation of fingering flow in horizontally layered systems while our relation suggests that only qs ks is required in fig 9 it is shown that in some of our experiments q s is larger than k u ψ e but fingering flow still occurs in the coarse sand layer 5 2 limitations of the f qs relationship eq 4 was derived under the assumption of gravity dominant flow and that the water head gradient is close to one in the vertical direction and not a strong function of local capillary pressure at locations occupied by finger flows liu 2011 2017 this prerequisite sets a limitation to our experimentally measured f qs relationship yao and hendrickx 1996 show that when water flux is low q f 0 12 c m h flow is dominated by capillary forces and finger flows merge to uniform flow in the coarse sand layer as the water flux increases gradually the width of finger flow decreases and then increases again after passing through a transition zone when water flux and the saturated conductivity are of the same order of magnitude the flow is dominated by the gravity force the flow becomes saturated and fingering flow disappears again when the water flux is equal to saturated conductivity in our experiment we control the water flux to be larger than 2 4 c m h to ensure that flow is dominated by gravity forces the capillary force is more likely to dominate over gravity in soils with smaller grain sizes where flow is greatly affected by the capillary force in the transversal direction and the finger flow width gradually increases over time finally transforms to uniform flow baker and hillel 1990 6 conclusion three groups of experiments were conducted to test the relationships between fingering flow fraction f and water flux qs and average active water saturation s e available experimental data from the literature were also compiled and compared with our new data the data show that the exponent of the f qs relationship a 0 varies within a small range from 0 39 to 0 48 and a 0 0 43 fits all five sets of experimental data there is no apparent correlation between the value of a 0 and grain size and the f qs relationship is independent on whether the sand is initially dry or there are existing fingers before new fingers form the measured f is also observed to correlate with s e and the value of γ is related to the value of a0 and grain size distribution the richards equation was combined with the f qs constitutive relationship to model the preferential flow experiments the results show that the models with the implemented constitutive relationship successfully reproduce the

water content 9 d a θ a a e b θ a where a and b are fitting parameters the water flux in the fingering region q f can be expressed as follows according to the darcy buckingham law 10 q f d a θ a θ a z k a θ a the effective saturation within the finger zone is defined as 11 s a θ a θ r θ s θ r where θ s and θ r are saturated and residual volumetric water contents k a can be calculated by the van genuchten permeability relation 12 k a s a k s s a 1 2 1 1 s a 1 m m 2 where k s is saturated hydraulic conductivity and m is a fitting parameter hydraulic parameters of the sands used in our experiments and in modeling are shown in table 5 the saturated conductivity was measured using the constant head method brooks 1965 the sand bulk density was determined by measuring the mass and volume of sand in the slab chamber the values of the van genuchten parameter m and α were from baker and hillel 1990 the parameters a and b were estimated using horizontal imbibition experiments bruce and klute 1956 all measurements were repeated several times and the average values were calculated 4 2 modeling results we used the relationship between f and qs with an a0 value of 0 43 to simulate the time evolution of water saturation in our experiments the governing equation was solved using an implicit finite difference scheme fig 6 a shows the distribution of simulated water content θ a at different time with q s k s 0 222 the wetting front moves downward with time with a constant velocity and the water wet zone has a constant steady state water saturation fig 6b shows the distribution of water content at the end of 1 min with q s k s varying from 0 009 to 0 781 the steady state water saturation increases with increasing q s k s and the wetting front travels faster with larger q s k to illustrate how including the f qs relation affects fluid flow we show in fig 7 modeling results of a specific experiment assuming uniform flow f 1 in comparison with the results with the f qs relationship implemented it is shown that failure to consider fingering flow underestimates the steady state water saturation θ a and the travel velocity of the wetting front v p fig 8 a d compiles all simulated steady state water saturations and travel velocities of the wetting front assuming fingering flow and uniform flow separately for the 20 30 and 30 40 mesh sand the water mass balance equation between the fine and coarse layers dictates that 13 q s f q f f v p θ a where qf is the water flux in the fingering zone and v p is the pore flow velocity with f smaller than 1 in fingering flow both v p and θ a are larger than in uniform flow our simulated v p and θ a with independently determined hydraulic parameters of the soil are in good agreement with measured values suggesting that the modeling approach used in this study can reproduce fingering flow successfully 5 discussion 5 1 other proposed f qs relationships in the literature hill and parlange 1972 first presented a simple criterion for predicting fingering flow in horizontally layered systems according to hill and parlange 1972 fingering flow occurs when the flux of water is less than the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the coarse sand layer q s k s 1 however hillel and baker 1988 suggested that the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s in the criterion should be replaced by the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at the water entry value k u ψ e baker and hillel 1990 proposed that fingering fraction f could be predicted by eq 6 based on baker and hillel 1990 the water entry pressure head ψ e is highly correlated with the median grain size of the porous medium for air dry sands this empirical relationship is given as baker and hillel 1990 14 ψ e 4 37 d 1 0 074 where ψ e is the water entry suction in cm and d is the median grain diameter in mm this means that for given porous medium the value of k u ψ e is fixed by its median grain diameter combining eq 6 and 13 it is predicted that 15 q f k u ψ e eq 15 suggests that with the increase of q s the flow velocity in the fingering zone q f is fixed at k u ψ e and the increase of q s and f are proportional we estimate that the median grain diameters of the sands used in our experiments are 675 μm and 477 5 μm for the 20 30 and 30 40 mesh sands according to the van genuchten model the k u ψ e values are 0 22 k s and 0 31 k s respectively here the k s values are for the 20 30 and 30 40 sands respectively fig 9 fig 9 shows the relationship between q f and q s k s observed in our experiments it is shown that the finger velocity q f increases with increasing q s rather than staying constant at k u ψ e our proposed relationship between f and qs is fundamentally different with that in baker and hillel 1990 in that in eq 13 both f and qf increase with increasing qs while in the relation in baker and hillel 1990 only f increases with qs while qf is constant the relation in eq 6 also requires that qs k u ψ e for the initiation of fingering flow in horizontally layered systems while our relation suggests that only qs ks is required in fig 9 it is shown that in some of our experiments q s is larger than k u ψ e but fingering flow still occurs in the coarse sand layer 5 2 limitations of the f qs relationship eq 4 was derived under the assumption of gravity dominant flow and that the water head gradient is close to one in the vertical direction and not a strong function of local capillary pressure at locations occupied by finger flows liu 2011 2017 this prerequisite sets a limitation to our experimentally measured f qs relationship yao and hendrickx 1996 show that when water flux is low q f 0 12 c m h flow is dominated by capillary forces and finger flows merge to uniform flow in the coarse sand layer as the water flux increases gradually the width of finger flow decreases and then increases again after passing through a transition zone when water flux and the saturated conductivity are of the same order of magnitude the flow is dominated by the gravity force the flow becomes saturated and fingering flow disappears again when the water flux is equal to saturated conductivity in our experiment we control the water flux to be larger than 2 4 c m h to ensure that flow is dominated by gravity forces the capillary force is more likely to dominate over gravity in soils with smaller grain sizes where flow is greatly affected by the capillary force in the transversal direction and the finger flow width gradually increases over time finally transforms to uniform flow baker and hillel 1990 6 conclusion three groups of experiments were conducted to test the relationships between fingering flow fraction f and water flux qs and average active water saturation s e available experimental data from the literature were also compiled and compared with our new data the data show that the exponent of the f qs relationship a 0 varies within a small range from 0 39 to 0 48 and a 0 0 43 fits all five sets of experimental data there is no apparent correlation between the value of a 0 and grain size and the f qs relationship is independent on whether the sand is initially dry or there are existing fingers before new fingers form the measured f is also observed to correlate with s e and the value of γ is related to the value of a0 and grain size distribution the richards equation was combined with the f qs constitutive relationship to model the preferential flow experiments the results show that the models with the implemented constitutive relationship successfully reproduce the preferential flow velocity and water saturation distribution in unsaturated soil credit authorship contribution statement yingjun liu data curation investigation writing original draft shuo zhang

1816,the transport of solutes in stream corridors is an important process for riverine biogeochemistry and ecosystem services this process is largely controlled by bulk movement in the stream channel and mass exchange with the hyporheic zone however modeling solute transport in stream corridors under dynamic hydrological conditions remains a scientific challenge here we extend a steady state lagrangian multiscale river corridor transport model to accommodate unsteady flow the extended numerical model was evaluated with observations of conservative tracer at a headwater mountain stream using markov chain monte carlo method to estimate model parameters and quantify uncertainty parameter estimation was exposed to a range of unsteady flow conditions through joint fitting of tracer data observed at different intervals of the base flow recession this yielded a robust scaling of hyporheic parameters with time varying streamflow which is evident from the good fit between modeled outputs and observations the proposed approach enables lagrangian based modeling of solute transport under dynamic flow regimes e g storm affected flow where discharge inevitably changes over time it also paves way for extending lagrangian based transport models to catchment and larger spatial scales keywords hyporheic zone modeling unsteady flow transport adels data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction process understanding and modeling of hyporheic exchange flow hef have been the subject of intensive research over the past few decades boano et al 2014 cardenas 2015 the exchange of water between stream and the hyporheic zone hz regions of sediment below and surrounding the channel that are permeated with stream water is one of the key elements of river corridors and underpins a host of water quality benefits and other ecosystem services boulton et al 1998 boano et al 2014 ward et al 2016 in fact both the amount of hyporheic mass exchange and their retention or residence times have significant implications for biogeochemical processing of nutrients and chemicals fuller and harvey 2000 conant et al 2004 battin et al 2008 mulholland et al 2008 runkel 2007 palumbo roe et al 2012 schaper et al 2018 models have long been developed to advance our understanding of hz flow and solute exchange as our knowledge of the underlying hydrological processes increases so does the complexity of the models used to describe hef one of the first quantitative descriptions of hef was the classical transient storage model tsm by bencala and walters 1983 in its original form the tsm conceptualizes a finite size well mixed transient storage zone tsz coupled to the main channel by single rate first order mass exchange the tsz temporarily holds solute and delays downstream transport for time scales longer than advection and dispersion this formulation implies an exponential distribution for the residence time in the hz bencala et al 2011 the classical tsm has several variations in representing solute exchange between the main channel and the tsz with the most common being the single rate mass transfer srmt approach runkel 1998 nevertheless the simple conceptual basis of the classical tsm with its single rate and constrained residence time distribution is often inadequate to reproduce the long tail of residence times that solute particles experience in the hz which can be important for nutrient and metal processing marion et al 2003 zaramella et al 2003 cardenas 2015 painter 2018 to better represent the wide ranging residence times of solute arrivals alternative parameterizations have been proposed with different mathematical exchange characterizations for example fang et al 2020 generalized the tsm by adopting multi rate mass transfer mrmt models to represent the interaction between surface water and the tszs this approach considers multiple well mixed tszs of different sizes that are each coupled to the flowing channel by first order mass exchange the mrmt models were originally developed for the study of transport in porous media haggerty and gorelick 1995 haggerty et al 2000 wang et al 2005 benson and meerschaert 2009 including reactive transport donado et al 2009 unlike the classical tsm the mrmt can be tuned to be consistent with an arbitrary residence time distribution however the mrmt retains the assumptions of well mixed tszs and first order exchange directly between each tsz and the flowing channel those assumptions are inconsistent with advective pumping elliott and brooks 1997b packman et al 2000 which is long recognized as an important exchange mechanism in many streams models that are conceptually consistent with advective pumping and flexible enough to accommodate an arbitrary residence time distribution have also been developed wörman et al 2002 haggerty et al 2002 gooseff et al 2003 this class of integrodifferential models represents the flux of solute returning to the stream as a convolution of in channel concentration with a hyporheic travel time distribution ttd convolution based models however are limited to steady discharge conditions and do not accommodate nonlinear reactive transport recognizing the advantages of the travel time based models and the limitations of a convolution based approach painter 2018 recently introduced an alternative formulation advective dispersion equation with lagrangian subgrids adels this formulation associates a subgrid model with each channel grid cell to represent an ensemble of streamlines that are diverted into the hz before returning to the channel adels also adopts a shape free hyporheic ttd liao and cirpka 2011 knapp and cirpka 2017 to capture the complex physical hydrology of the hz for nonreacting tracers and steady channel flow adels and multi rate tsm are equivalent to each other and to the convolution based models painter 2021 unlike the convolution based models both adels and the multirate tsm generalize to include nonlinear multicomponent reactive transport although adels and multirate tsm can be made equivalent for nonreacting transport the two models have very different underlying conceptualizations of transport in the hz and mass exchange between the hz and the stream channel which results in different reactive transport predictions painter 2021 as originally formulated the adels model was limited to steady flow conditions with that restriction the steady adels model is useful for modeling relatively short duration reach scale tracer tests where the steady flow approximation is often adequate however given the dynamic nature of streams and rivers the steady flow restriction clearly limits the usefulness of steady adels for other applications that require longer time frames the main objective of this paper is to remove this limitation of the original adels by extending the framework to account for unsteady channel flow the extended model enables lagrangian based multiscale modeling of solute transport in river corridors under dynamic flow regimes this is achieved by explicitly incorporating the controls of streamflow variability on hef and transport dynamics in the hz by considering the effects of seasonal or short term fluctuations in streamflow this approach provides a crucial step towards extending lagrangian based transport models to river network and larger spatial scales which cannot be achieved using steady state formulations a fundamental component of the unsteady model is the use of the flow factor approach selroos et al 2013 sanz prat et al 2016 which assumes that only the magnitude of the velocity in the hz fluctuates with time varying streamflow whereas the pathline trajectory can be approximated as constant we apply the markov chain monte carlo mcmc technique in an uncertainty aware bayesian framework to estimate model parameters including the shape free ttd thus rigorously treating parameter uncertainty and capturing the complex dynamics of transport in the hz using data from previously published tracer tests in a headwater mountain stream over a wide range of streamflow magnitudes during base flow recession we demonstrate the effectiveness of the unsteady adels model in reproducing the field data accurately and extracting useful information from the tracer in the form of full joint distributions of parameters 2 multiscale models for transport in stream corridors 2 1 steady flow the adels approach recently developed by painter 2018 2021 describes the hz transport system in lagrangian form as a subgrid model with hyporheic age replacing the spatial coordinate the underlying principle of this approach is that all streamlines entering the hz from a common channel location have the same upstream boundary condition governed by the concentration in the stream channel and thus the concentration profiles are identical along the streamlines and differ only by the travel time this means that only a single representative pathway needs to be simulated for each channel grid cell and the ensemble result can then be derived by integrating information at various ages along that subgrid simulation properly weighted by the hyporheic ttd from modeling perspective although restricted to steady state flow this lagrangian based approach makes adels computationally efficient and allows relatively coarse discretization of the stream channel while still capturing well the effects of fine scale geochemical variability within the hz under steady state flow condition the adels model for nonreacting tracers on a single reach without gaining or losing terms for simplicity is expressed mathematically as 1a a c t q c x x a d c x α a c α a 0 c h z x t t ϕ t d t 1b c h z t c h z τ 0 1c c h z x t 0 c x t where x denotes the distance along the channel l t represents time t c is the concentration in the channel m l 3 d is longitudinal dispersion coefficient l 2 t 1 q is channel flow l 3 t 1 a is the channel wet cross section area l 2 c h z represents concentration in the hz m l 3 τ is hyporheic age or the time elapsed by a tracer since it starts moving on a hyporheic streamline t α is the rate of water turnover through or exchange with the hz t 1 and ϕ t is the probability density function pdf of hyporheic travel time t also known as lifetime in the hz t 1 the integral in eq 1a can be approximated with a quadrature that are equally spaced in probability painter 2018 as 2 0 c h z x t t ϕ t d t 1 n i 1 n c h z x t φ 1 i 1 2 n in which n is the number of quadrature points φ is the cumulative distribution of hyporheic travel time φ 1 its inverse and ϕ t φ t this approximation to the integral is highly efficient in that it converges quickly as n increases thus reducing the number of unknowns in the subgrid representation we note that eq 1b is reduced from the original transport equation in spatial coordinate and is the same as an equation of one dimensional transport in lagrangian travel time form dagan and cvetkovic 1993 cvetkovic and dagan 1994 eq 1c and the last term in eq 1a provide the coupling between the channel and hz with the latter acting as a solute source to the channel and the stream concentration providing the upstream boundary condition on the canonical streamline for the hz painter 2018 the weighting by the hyporheic travel time distribution ϕ t accounts for flowpath diversity within hz when the hyporheic ttd is the exponential distribution adels reduces to the single rate tsm runkel 1998 which has analytical solutions for instantaneous injection of solute mass de smedt et al 2005 van genuchten et al 2013 that equivalence requires the quantiles be set to those of the exponential distribution 3 φ 1 i 1 2 n ln 1 i 1 2 n λ for i 1 n where λ is the rate parameter of the exponential distribution t 1 and t s 1 λ is the mean storage zone residence time t runkel 2002 calculated as 4 t s 1 α a s a in which a s is the cross sectional area of the storage zone l 2 the adels framework has been implemented in the advanced terrestrial simulator ats coon et al 2019 and demonstrated for simulating biogeochemical processes in river networks under the assumption of steady state flow at an annual timescale jan et al 2021 2 2 transient flow we now extend the adels framework to account for unsteady flow with two basic assumptions without loss of generality we write 5 q x t q 0 x f q x t where q 0 x is the so called equivalent steady state flow l t 3 and f q x t 1 the corresponding flow depth d x t l and flow width w x t l can be obtained using the hydraulic geometry scaling relations in the form of power functions of streamflow see fig 1b described by leopold and maddock 1953 6a d x t b d q x t a d 6b w x t b w q x t a w where a d b d a w and b w are empirical regression coefficients the velocity of the overlying flow l t 1 in the channel is then calculated as 7 u x t q x t w x t d x t 8 1 b d b w q 0 x f q x t 1 a w a d we also need to relate the hyporheic exchange rate constant α x t to the unsteady channel flow for the special case of dune shaped bedforms that relationship is also power law as demonstrated in appendix a motivated by that result and by hydraulic geometry scaling relationships in general we further assume that the power law relationship is an adequate approximation more generally 9 α x t α 0 x f q x t β α x where and β α x is the scaling exponent of hyporheic exchange due to the variation of head boundary on the stream bed for the special case of dune shaped bedforms β α 2 2 a w 27 8 a d appendix a here we treat α 0 and β α as uncertain parameters to be determined by parameter estimation the longitudinal dispersion coefficient is calculated as fischer 1975 antonopoulos et al 2015 10 d x t a d x t u x t u x t u x t b w x t d x t c where u g r s f is the bed shear velocity l t 2 r is the hydraulic radius l g denotes the gravitational constant l t 2 and s f is the bed slope coefficients a b and c are constants because all terms on the right hand side of eq 8 are dependent on stream discharge q x t this equation can be reduced to the form 11 d x t d 0 x f q x t β d x where d 0 x l 2 t 1 is the mean longitudinal dispersion coefficient and β d x is the scaling factor representing the fluctuation of longitudinal dispersion coefficient around the mean value two additional assumptions are needed to account for the effect of transient channel flow on hyporheic zone transport the first is that the propagation of flow perturbation in the hz is instantaneous in other words a sequence of quasi steady states is assumed under unsteady flow conditions the second assumption is of constant geometry for streamlines in the hz under transient flow condition this implies that the streamlines follow constant trajectories independent of stream discharge but the speed at which solutes move on those streamlines is variable due to the fluctuation of the hydraulic head boundary conditions caused by the time varying channel flow this approximation is again motivated in part by the advective bedform pumping vaux 1968 elliott and brooks 1997b grant et al 2020 with those two assumptions the lagrangian subgrid model for hyporheic zone transport eq 1b is then extended to transient flow according to a flow factor approach selroos et al 2013 sanz prat et al 2016 12 c h z t ν x t c h z τ 0 in which ν x t accounts for fluctuations of the darcy velocity around the average value as in steady state condition 13 ν x t f q x t β ν here the flow factor ν x t fluctuates around unity and β ν represents the scaling factor of velocity in the hz due to the variation of head boundary on the stream bed note that the hyporheic travel time distribution in this formulation corresponds to steady state channel flow changes in the hyporheic travel time caused by deviations from the average channel flow are accounted for by the pseudo velocity ν x t the time series f q x t is obtained from streamflow whereas other unknown parameters are proposed to be estimated through model calibration once the unknown parameters are identified coefficients α x t d x t and ν x t can be estimated equations 3 10 constitute the generalization of adels to unsteady channel flow the validity of this formulation is evaluated by observations of nonreacting tracer data presented in the next section 3 application 3 1 study area we used the tracer data sets voltz et al 2013 ward et al 2016 from a headwater catchment ws01 in the h j andrews experimental forest in the western cascade mountains oregon usa to evaluate the unsteady model fig 2a the elevation in ws01 catchment ranging from 432 to 1018 m above the mean sea level and the valley is deeply dissected by the stream with steep down valley gradient 11 9 kasahara and wondzell 2003 the study reach is located near the outlet of the ws01 fig 2b the catchment is gauged for discharge approximately 50 m downstream of the study reach with weirs calibrated and maintained by the u s forest service the study area has a mediterranean climate with wet mild winters and dry cool summers annual precipitation is about 2300 mm and most of the precipitation falls as rain from october to may resulting in a base flow recession period that begins in mid to late june and lasts until late august or september johnson et al 2021 the study period in the present work june september 2010 had a fairly typical seasonal base flow recession see fig 2c top panel in the voltz et al 2013 tracer tests four constant rate injections of sodium chloride nacl assumed to be a conservative tracer were conducted by pumping a concentrated nacl solution directly into the stream at the upstream of the study reach see fig 2c bottom panel based on flow estimates from the downstream gauging station and to achieve uniform plateau concentrations an appropriate mass of salt was dissolved in stream water and pumped continuously into the stream for each test for 48 h starting and ending at approximately 13 00 injections were also completed a minimum of 2 weeks apart to ensure that tracer concentration in the stream returned to a background condition so that the tail of one injection s tracer btc did not interfere with the rising limb of the next voltz et al 2013 ward et al 2016 the injection site was located about 40 m upstream of the monitoring location same for all injection periods see fig 2b allowing sufficient channel distance for complete mixing in the stream in all monitoring specific conductance sc was measured with the cs547 a conductivity probe by a campbell scientific inc logan utah usa data logger and used as a surrogate for tracer concentration voltz et al 2013 ward et al 2016 fig 2d shows the btcs measured by voltz et al 2013 for the four tests that were performed at different times in a long base flow recession period in 2010 these observations were used for evaluating the unsteady adels model and parameter estimation by using multiple tracer tests across a wide range of streamflow magnitudes over the base flow recession period we can better assess the skills and robustness of the unsteady model in capturing the effects of time varying streamflow on tracer transport 3 2 parameter estimation model parameters and their distributions are often identified by fitting model simulations to field observations from tracer tests we adapted the ats with unsteady adels implemented within it for forward simulations of transports and used the mcmc sampling technique for model parameter estimation see si figure s1 the parameters in the unsteady adels model to be estimated are shown in table 1 representing key hydrological and transport processes since the study reach is relatively small we assume that model parameters are homogeneous in space the cumulative distribution function cdf for travel time described by equally spaced quantiles eq 2 was represented in ats model as quantile differences δ t i t i 1 t i r 0 for i 1 n note that by parameterizing the hyporheic travel time through quantiles i e differences we maintained a shape free ttd which offers greater flexibility to encode complex hz physical hydrology through a fairly small number of parameters rathore et al 2021 a set of n 10 equally spaced quantiles were used to describe the ttd in the hz which was found to be efficient and effective in reproducing the tailing behavior in the observed btcs painter 2018 as a result a total number of 15 parameters were simultaneously estimated using mcmc in a bayesian framework by matching the simulated and observed btcs within the measurement uncertainty limits for mcmc runs we used pydream shockley et al 2017 a python implementation of the dream zs algorithm laloy and vrugt 2012 dream zs is one of the most advanced adaptions of the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream vrugt et al 2009 a multichain mcmc technique that adapt scale and orientation automatically making it efficient in sampling from challenging parameter spaces this efficient implementation provided our analyses the vigor to estimate shape free ttd together with other parameters in multiple mcmc experiments offering robust comparisons in the estimated joint distributions of model parameters in the following we provide details of the inverse problem and mcmc implementation inverse problem setup we adopted the bayesian framework to obtain the distribution of unsteady adels model parameters let θ be the vector of parameter set to be estimated conditioned on the observed concentration c o b s applying the bayes theorem 14 p θ c o b s p c o b s θ p θ in which p c o b s θ is the likelihood function describing the goodness of fit of the model to the data c o b s given the parameter set θ and probability p θ represents the prior knowledge about the parameters concentration at each time point on c o b s is assumed to follow gaussian distribution therefore p c o b s θ can be described as 15 p c o b s θ 1 2 π n σ exp 1 2 c o b s c s i m t σ 1 c o b s c s i m where σ is the covariance matrix of the measurement errors σ its determinant and n is the length of the observed concentration time series we assume uncorrelated measurement errors resulting in a diagonal σ matrix with measurement variances as diagonal elements at time point i the standard deviation σ i for measurement c i is modeled by σ i σ r e l c i σ a b s here σ r e l is the relative error representing the systematic component of the error resulting from factors including but not limited to changing field conditions during the experiment and instrument calibration and σ a b s is the absolute error representing the uncertainty introduced mainly due to the quantification limit of the instrument knapp and cirpka 2017 rathore et al 2021 mcmc implementation we used the mcmc sampling technique to obtain approximate distributions of parameters θ given the observed concentration c o b s samples were generated through random walk of mcmc chains in the parameter space guided by the performance criterion based on p θ c o b s following an evolutionary mechanism the next position in the random walk by a dream chain was proposed by taking the difference between existing positions of two randomly selected chains and the proposal was accepted or rejected based on metropolis criteria vrugt et al 2009 similar to rathore et al 2021 we set the number of differential evolution pairs equal to 2 gamma levels to 4 probability of gamma being equal to unity is set to 0 3 and snooker step is avoided by setting its probability equal to 0 wide initial parameter ranges were chosen with uniform sampling for forward model runs a forward model run included 4 simulations by unsteady adels ats one for each injection period with the same model parameters but different inputs e g injection mass and stream flow for each parameter estimation run we used five communicating chains in parallel and ran them until we had at least 10 000 generations per chain after all chains had converged the convergence was tested using the reduction factor r ˆ criteria by gelman and rubin 1992 which compares the variance of each chain to the pooled variance chains were considered converged when r ˆ was stable below 1 2 for all parameters si figure s2 the posterior distributions of the estimated parameters were then summarized using 10 000 samples providing a robust estimate of the distributions 3 3 results and discussion transport dynamics and model comparison fig 3 shows the comparison between the observed btcs gray dots for the four tracer tests and the simulated btcs obtained from the adels model the unsteady simulations are shown as colored bands based on an ensemble of btcs obtained from 600 parameter sets sampled from the posterior distribution for comparison we also include results from steady adels simulations solid black lines obtained by setting f q x t 1 in each of the test periods but with a test specific average discharge q the adels parameter set in the steady simulations was chosen to be the one with the largest likelihood of the 600 parameter sets see table s1 three distinct stages were evident in the observed and simulated btcs during the initial stage the concentrations rose dramatically as the tracer front arrived this stage was followed by a period about 48 h in which the concentrations fluctuated in response to changes in the streamflow during the final stage the concentration decreased as the tracer front passed and tracer mass left the hz back to the stream in this stage the long tails of the btcs indicate that there was a high degree of hyporheic exchange within the study reach although the unsteady model slightly underestimates the peak of concentration in test period 2 the fit between observed and unsteady simulated concentration as quantified by the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index nash and sutcliffe 1970 is very good greater than 0 90 for each of the four simulated tracer tests highlighting the ability of the proposed framework in quantifying the hz and channel controls on the transport of tracer in the stream corridor under unsteady flow stream flow magnitude was significantly different among the four tests and varied with significant diurnal signal during two of the tests fig 2c which had a strong influence on tracer concentration both in the channel and hz specifically at low streamflow magnitudes periods 3 and 4 exhibited a coherent signal of the diurnal cycle in observed streamflow and the btcs of the tracer in both the plateaus and tails fig 3c d these fluctuations occur primarily due to the daily cycle of evapotranspiration in the watershed wondzell et al 2010 the diurnal fluctuation of the observed btc during period 4 along the tail 6 to 7 days reflects the effects of changes in dilution as solute returns from the hz to a channel with fluctuating discharge the signal of diurnal cycle shown in tests 1 and 2 is weak owing to the relatively high magnitudes of streamflow during those periods fig 3a b however streamflow is decreasing during those tests which causes a slight upward drift of the plateau concentration that is reproduced by the unsteady adels simulations but not by the steady adels simulation while the rising limbs of the btcs are quite similar the falling limbs are very different in particular the slopes the of the falling limbs decrease from periods 1 to 4 reflecting greater significance of hyporheic exchange relative to downstream movement in the lower flow conditions the results presented in periods 3 and 4 show that the unsteady model captures quite well the fluctuations e g diurnal cycle in the corresponding btcs in response to changes in streamflow whereas the steady model does not this illustrates the usefulness of the unsteady model for simulating the complex dynamics of transport in the channel and hz however the two adels models are fairly comparable when the short term fluctuations in the streamflow are weak e g streamflow in periods 1 and 2 overall the good fit shown in our results across all periods demonstrates the skills and robustness of the unsteady model to capture the effects of time varying flow on tracer transport parameter identifiability and distributions the

the median travel time in the hz t 50 i 1 5 δ t i are presented in fig 4 metrics of these distributions are given in table 2 best fit parameters and standard deviations the t 50 indicates the middle value of the time interval that solute resides in the hz and is therefore more intuitive to interpret compared to quantile differences in general the obtained parameters lie in the expected ranges and most of the parameter distributions exhibit significant single peak in the histogram unimodality showing that the parameters are uniquely identified and well constrained by the observed btcs among parameters β d shows slightly higher uncertainty compared to other parameters but it still clearly has a preferred range with a central tendency these results demonstrate that inverse modeling using unsteady adels successfully extracted the information from the imprints of the channel and hz processes on the observed btcs the ranges of the estimated α 0 and d 0 were also found consistent with those shown in previous studies rathore et al 2021 ward et al 2015 with median estimates of α 0 9 4 1 0 5 1 s and d 0 0 015 m 2 s the median t 50 is approximately 6 1 h which is longer than values reported in the study by rathore et al 2021 that study focused on a reach characterized by sand dominated bed sediments that may be expected to have shorter travel times the bivariate distributions of the 6 key parameters also reveal interactions between parameters as a result of trade offs in the process representation first almost no correlation between d 0 and the other 4 parameters except β d is observed demonstrated by the circular shapes of the joint distributions this is consistent with past work estimating model parameters under steady state flow condition rathore et al 2021 second the joint distribution between α 0 and β ν exhibits a linear correlation where higher hyporheic exchange corresponds to lower hz velocity scaling factor as small perturbations around the mode of the distribution despite noteworthy interaction distributions are well constrained by the observed btcs and identified uniquely finally a negative and relatively weak correlation is observed between α 0 and t 50 implying that higher hyporheic exchange rate corresponds to shorter travel times through the hz the advantage and flexibility of the shape free over parametric approaches have been demonstrated to reduce the ambiguity of model parameters particularly when the reach is short as in our study knapp and cirpka 2017 rathore et al 2021 indeed the shape free ttd in unsteady adels can capture the complexity in hz physical hydrology thus predicting all parts of the btc fig 5 shows an ensemble of 600 estimated travel time cdfs obtained from mcmc simulations the results reveal relatively long travel time approximately 5 7 days for the 90th percentile of the ttd which is as long as the duration of several tests by construction tracer tests cannot determine travel times on the order or longer than the duration of the experiment itself on the other hand the 10th percentile of the ttd is much shorter in the range of minutes to less than an hour the cdfs generally encompass a spread of only 10 15 or less of the most likely value this result indicates a high reliability of the fitted ttd parameters from the mcmc simulations model formulation transport of solutes in stream corridors subject to unsteady flow has been simulated in models with a transient storage component runkel et al 1998 in these tsm models the hyporheic exchange coefficient α is assumed to be constant and unaffected by temporal changes in streamflow discharge q other assumptions in the tsm formulation are that water in the storage zone is well mixed and immobile relative to water in the main channel bencala and walters 1983 these assumptions are appropriate when the tsm is relatively small and exchange between the channel and streambed is diffusively controlled when exchange and transport are dominated by advection solute concentrations will vary along the hyporheic streamlines and exchange may depend on channel discharge as in the advective pumping model in the unsteady adels model presented here we were able to incorporate these relationships by explicitly formulating α and other hz parameters as a function of streamflow q this improvement unlocks new possibilities for studying transport in more complex river corridors under unsteady flow conditions 4 conclusions an important challenge in modeling transport of nutrients carbon and contaminants in stream river networks at river basin scales is to simultaneously represent the effects of diverse flowpaths through the hyporheic zone and fine scale gradients in geochemical conditions along those flowpaths the multiscale adels framework addresses that challenge by combining lagrangian subgrid models for reactive transport in the hyporheic zone with hyporheic travel time distributions to quantify flowpath diversity here we extended the approach to accommodate unsteady stream discharge a critical step in making the approach appropriate for watershed scale reactive transport applications the unsteady adels model approximates hyporheic flowpaths as having fixed trajectories but with time varying flow speed consistent with bedform pumping models the unsteady version also makes use of widely used hydraulic geometry scaling arguments to evaluate the performance of the unsteady adels model with those physically motivated approximations we evaluated it against previously published data from four tracer tests in a headwater mountain stream in the h j andrews experimental forest voltz et al 2013 ward et al 2016 that we were able to fit a single model to the four time varying tests across a wide range of streamflow magnitudes demonstrates that our multiscale framework is transferable to different flow conditions and effective at reproducing tracer tests moreover the results demonstrate that key model parameters including the full joint distributions of parameters can be estimated from tracer test breakthrough curves while the focus of this study was nonreacting tracer on a small single reach our multiscale model is applicable to general reactive transport at larger scales and is available in the open source ats code jan et al 2021 an obvious direction for future work is to test the unsteady adels model at river network scales another important direction for future work is to integrate the multiscale river stream corridor model into full three dimensional watershed models which will enable the representation of biogeochemical effects of overbank flooding longer range hyporheic flowpaths and regional scale groundwater inflows that integrated model will represent a powerful new multiscale capability to model watershed scale reactive transport without ad hoc upscaling of fine scale biogeochemical processes in hz hotspots credit authorship contribution statement phong v v

1816,the transport of solutes in stream corridors is an important process for riverine biogeochemistry and ecosystem services this process is largely controlled by bulk movement in the stream channel and mass exchange with the hyporheic zone however modeling solute transport in stream corridors under dynamic hydrological conditions remains a scientific challenge here we extend a steady state lagrangian multiscale river corridor transport model to accommodate unsteady flow the extended numerical model was evaluated with observations of conservative tracer at a headwater mountain stream using markov chain monte carlo method to estimate model parameters and quantify uncertainty parameter estimation was exposed to a range of unsteady flow conditions through joint fitting of tracer data observed at different intervals of the base flow recession this yielded a robust scaling of hyporheic parameters with time varying streamflow which is evident from the good fit between modeled outputs and observations the proposed approach enables lagrangian based modeling of solute transport under dynamic flow regimes e g storm affected flow where discharge inevitably changes over time it also paves way for extending lagrangian based transport models to catchment and larger spatial scales keywords hyporheic zone modeling unsteady flow transport adels data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction process understanding and modeling of hyporheic exchange flow hef have been the subject of intensive research over the past few decades boano et al 2014 cardenas 2015 the exchange of water between stream and the hyporheic zone hz regions of sediment below and surrounding the channel that are permeated with stream water is one of the key elements of river corridors and underpins a host of water quality benefits and other ecosystem services boulton et al 1998 boano et al 2014 ward et al 2016 in fact both the amount of hyporheic mass exchange and their retention or residence times have significant implications for biogeochemical processing of nutrients and chemicals fuller and harvey 2000 conant et al 2004 battin et al 2008 mulholland et al 2008 runkel 2007 palumbo roe et al 2012 schaper et al 2018 models have long been developed to advance our understanding of hz flow and solute exchange as our knowledge of the underlying hydrological processes increases so does the complexity of the models used to describe hef one of the first quantitative descriptions of hef was the classical transient storage model tsm by bencala and walters 1983 in its original form the tsm conceptualizes a finite size well mixed transient storage zone tsz coupled to the main channel by single rate first order mass exchange the tsz temporarily holds solute and delays downstream transport for time scales longer than advection and dispersion this formulation implies an exponential distribution for the residence time in the hz bencala et al 2011 the classical tsm has several variations in representing solute exchange between the main channel and the tsz with the most common being the single rate mass transfer srmt approach runkel 1998 nevertheless the simple conceptual basis of the classical tsm with its single rate and constrained residence time distribution is often inadequate to reproduce the long tail of residence times that solute particles experience in the hz which can be important for nutrient and metal processing marion et al 2003 zaramella et al 2003 cardenas 2015 painter 2018 to better represent the wide ranging residence times of solute arrivals alternative parameterizations have been proposed with different mathematical exchange characterizations for example fang et al 2020 generalized the tsm by adopting multi rate mass transfer mrmt models to represent the interaction between surface water and the tszs this approach considers multiple well mixed tszs of different sizes that are each coupled to the flowing channel by first order mass exchange the mrmt models were originally developed for the study of transport in porous media haggerty and gorelick 1995 haggerty et al 2000 wang et al 2005 benson and meerschaert 2009 including reactive transport donado et al 2009 unlike the classical tsm the mrmt can be tuned to be consistent with an arbitrary residence time distribution however the mrmt retains the assumptions of well mixed tszs and first order exchange directly between each tsz and the flowing channel those assumptions are inconsistent with advective pumping elliott and brooks 1997b packman et al 2000 which is long recognized as an important exchange mechanism in many streams models that are conceptually consistent with advective pumping and flexible enough to accommodate an arbitrary residence time distribution have also been developed wörman et al 2002 haggerty et al 2002 gooseff et al 2003 this class of integrodifferential models represents the flux of solute returning to the stream as a convolution of in channel concentration with a hyporheic travel time distribution ttd convolution based models however are limited to steady discharge conditions and do not accommodate nonlinear reactive transport recognizing the advantages of the travel time based models and the limitations of a convolution based approach painter 2018 recently introduced an alternative formulation advective dispersion equation with lagrangian subgrids adels this formulation associates a subgrid model with each channel grid cell to represent an ensemble of streamlines that are diverted into the hz before returning to the channel adels also adopts a shape free hyporheic ttd liao and cirpka 2011 knapp and cirpka 2017 to capture the complex physical hydrology of the hz for nonreacting tracers and steady channel flow adels and multi rate tsm are equivalent to each other and to the convolution based models painter 2021 unlike the convolution based models both adels and the multirate tsm generalize to include nonlinear multicomponent reactive transport although adels and multirate tsm can be made equivalent for nonreacting transport the two models have very different underlying conceptualizations of transport in the hz and mass exchange between the hz and the stream channel which results in different reactive transport predictions painter 2021 as originally formulated the adels model was limited to steady flow conditions with that restriction the steady adels model is useful for modeling relatively short duration reach scale tracer tests where the steady flow approximation is often adequate however given the dynamic nature of streams and rivers the steady flow restriction clearly limits the usefulness of steady adels for other applications that require longer time frames the main objective of this paper is to remove this limitation of the original adels by extending the framework to account for unsteady channel flow the extended model enables lagrangian based multiscale modeling of solute transport in river corridors under dynamic flow regimes this is achieved by explicitly incorporating the controls of streamflow variability on hef and transport dynamics in the hz by considering the effects of seasonal or short term fluctuations in streamflow this approach provides a crucial step towards extending lagrangian based transport models to river network and larger spatial scales which cannot be achieved using steady state formulations a fundamental component of the unsteady model is the use of the flow factor approach selroos et al 2013 sanz prat et al 2016 which assumes that only the magnitude of the velocity in the hz fluctuates with time varying streamflow whereas the pathline trajectory can be approximated as constant we apply the markov chain monte carlo mcmc technique in an uncertainty aware bayesian framework to estimate model parameters including the shape free ttd thus rigorously treating parameter uncertainty and capturing the complex dynamics of transport in the hz using data from previously published tracer tests in a headwater mountain stream over a wide range of streamflow magnitudes during base flow recession we demonstrate the effectiveness of the unsteady adels model in reproducing the field data accurately and extracting useful information from the tracer in the form of full joint distributions of parameters 2 multiscale models for transport in stream corridors 2 1 steady flow the adels approach recently developed by painter 2018 2021 describes the hz transport system in lagrangian form as a subgrid model with hyporheic age replacing the spatial coordinate the underlying principle of this approach is that all streamlines entering the hz from a common channel location have the same upstream boundary condition governed by the concentration in the stream channel and thus the concentration profiles are identical along the streamlines and differ only by the travel time this means that only a single representative pathway needs to be simulated for each channel grid cell and the ensemble result can then be derived by integrating information at various ages along that subgrid simulation properly weighted by the hyporheic ttd from modeling perspective although restricted to steady state flow this lagrangian based approach makes adels computationally efficient and allows relatively coarse discretization of the stream channel while still capturing well the effects of fine scale geochemical variability within the hz under steady state flow condition the adels model for nonreacting tracers on a single reach without gaining or losing terms for simplicity is expressed mathematically as 1a a c t q c x x a d c x α a c α a 0 c h z x t t ϕ t d t 1b c h z t c h z τ 0 1c c h z x t 0 c x t where x denotes the distance along the channel l t represents time t c is the concentration in the channel m l 3 d is longitudinal dispersion coefficient l 2 t 1 q is channel flow l 3 t 1 a is the channel wet cross section area l 2 c h z represents concentration in the hz m l 3 τ is hyporheic age or the time elapsed by a tracer since it starts moving on a hyporheic streamline t α is the rate of water turnover through or exchange with the hz t 1 and ϕ t is the probability density function pdf of hyporheic travel time t also known as lifetime in the hz t 1 the integral in eq 1a can be approximated with a quadrature that are equally spaced in probability painter 2018 as 2 0 c h z x t t ϕ t d t 1 n i 1 n c h z x t φ 1 i 1 2 n in which n is the number of quadrature points φ is the cumulative distribution of hyporheic travel time φ 1 its inverse and ϕ t φ t this approximation to the integral is highly efficient in that it converges quickly as n increases thus reducing the number of unknowns in the subgrid representation we note that eq 1b is reduced from the original transport equation in spatial coordinate and is the same as an equation of one dimensional transport in lagrangian travel time form dagan and cvetkovic 1993 cvetkovic and dagan 1994 eq 1c and the last term in eq 1a provide the coupling between the channel and hz with the latter acting as a solute source to the channel and the stream concentration providing the upstream boundary condition on the canonical streamline for the hz painter 2018 the weighting by the hyporheic travel time distribution ϕ t accounts for flowpath diversity within hz when the hyporheic ttd is the exponential distribution adels reduces to the single rate tsm runkel 1998 which has analytical solutions for instantaneous injection of solute mass de smedt et al 2005 van genuchten et al 2013 that equivalence requires the quantiles be set to those of the exponential distribution 3 φ 1 i 1 2 n ln 1 i 1 2 n λ for i 1 n where λ is the rate parameter of the exponential distribution t 1 and t s 1 λ is the mean storage zone residence time t runkel 2002 calculated as 4 t s 1 α a s a in which a s is the cross sectional area of the storage zone l 2 the adels framework has been implemented in the advanced terrestrial simulator ats coon et al 2019 and demonstrated for simulating biogeochemical processes in river networks under the assumption of steady state flow at an annual timescale jan et al 2021 2 2 transient flow we now extend the adels framework to account for unsteady flow with two basic assumptions without loss of generality we write 5 q x t q 0 x f q x t where q 0 x is the so called equivalent steady state flow l t 3 and f q x t 1 the corresponding flow depth d x t l and flow width w x t l can be obtained using the hydraulic geometry scaling relations in the form of power functions of streamflow see fig 1b described by leopold and maddock 1953 6a d x t b d q x t a d 6b w x t b w q x t a w where a d b d a w and b w are empirical regression coefficients the velocity of the overlying flow l t 1 in the channel is then calculated as 7 u x t q x t w x t d x t 8 1 b d b w q 0 x f q x t 1 a w a d we also need to relate the hyporheic exchange rate constant α x t to the unsteady channel flow for the special case of dune shaped bedforms that relationship is also power law as demonstrated in appendix a motivated by that result and by hydraulic geometry scaling relationships in general we further assume that the power law relationship is an adequate approximation more generally 9 α x t α 0 x f q x t β α x where and β α x is the scaling exponent of hyporheic exchange due to the variation of head boundary on the stream bed for the special case of dune shaped bedforms β α 2 2 a w 27 8 a d appendix a here we treat α 0 and β α as uncertain parameters to be determined by parameter estimation the longitudinal dispersion coefficient is calculated as fischer 1975 antonopoulos et al 2015 10 d x t a d x t u x t u x t u x t b w x t d x t c where u g r s f is the bed shear velocity l t 2 r is the hydraulic radius l g denotes the gravitational constant l t 2 and s f is the bed slope coefficients a b and c are constants because all terms on the right hand side of eq 8 are dependent on stream discharge q x t this equation can be reduced to the form 11 d x t d 0 x f q x t β d x where d 0 x l 2 t 1 is the mean longitudinal dispersion coefficient and β d x is the scaling factor representing the fluctuation of longitudinal dispersion coefficient around the mean value two additional assumptions are needed to account for the effect of transient channel flow on hyporheic zone transport the first is that the propagation of flow perturbation in the hz is instantaneous in other words a sequence of quasi steady states is assumed under unsteady flow conditions the second assumption is of constant geometry for streamlines in the hz under transient flow condition this implies that the streamlines follow constant trajectories independent of stream discharge but the speed at which solutes move on those streamlines is variable due to the fluctuation of the hydraulic head boundary conditions caused by the time varying channel flow this approximation is again motivated in part by the advective bedform pumping vaux 1968 elliott and brooks 1997b grant et al 2020 with those two assumptions the lagrangian subgrid model for hyporheic zone transport eq 1b is then extended to transient flow according to a flow factor approach selroos et al 2013 sanz prat et al 2016 12 c h z t ν x t c h z τ 0 in which ν x t accounts for fluctuations of the darcy velocity around the average value as in steady state condition 13 ν x t f q x t β ν here the flow factor ν x t fluctuates around unity and β ν represents the scaling factor of velocity in the hz due to the variation of head boundary on the stream bed note that the hyporheic travel time distribution in this formulation corresponds to steady state channel flow changes in the hyporheic travel time caused by deviations from the average channel flow are accounted for by the pseudo velocity ν x t the time series f q x t is obtained from streamflow whereas other unknown parameters are proposed to be estimated through model calibration once the unknown parameters are identified coefficients α x t d x t and ν x t can be estimated equations 3 10 constitute the generalization of adels to unsteady channel flow the validity of this formulation is evaluated by observations of nonreacting tracer data presented in the next section 3 application 3 1 study area we used the tracer data sets voltz et al 2013 ward et al 2016 from a headwater catchment ws01 in the h j andrews experimental forest in the western cascade mountains oregon usa to evaluate the unsteady model fig 2a the elevation in ws01 catchment ranging from 432 to 1018 m above the mean sea level and the valley is deeply dissected by the stream with steep down valley gradient 11 9 kasahara and wondzell 2003 the study reach is located near the outlet of the ws01 fig 2b the catchment is gauged for discharge approximately 50 m downstream of the study reach with weirs calibrated and maintained by the u s forest service the study area has a mediterranean climate with wet mild winters and dry cool summers annual precipitation is about 2300 mm and most of the precipitation falls as rain from october to may resulting in a base flow recession period that begins in mid to late june and lasts until late august or september johnson et al 2021 the study period in the present work june september 2010 had a fairly typical seasonal base flow recession see fig 2c top panel in the voltz et al 2013 tracer tests four constant rate injections of sodium chloride nacl assumed to be a conservative tracer were conducted by pumping a concentrated nacl solution directly into the stream at the upstream of the study reach see fig 2c bottom panel based on flow estimates from the downstream gauging station and to achieve uniform plateau concentrations an appropriate mass of salt was dissolved in stream water and pumped continuously into the stream for each test for 48 h starting and ending at approximately 13 00 injections were also completed a minimum of 2 weeks apart to ensure that tracer concentration in the stream returned to a background condition so that the tail of one injection s tracer btc did not interfere with the rising limb of the next voltz et al 2013 ward et al 2016 the injection site was located about 40 m upstream of the monitoring location same for all injection periods see fig 2b allowing sufficient channel distance for complete mixing in the stream in all monitoring specific conductance sc was measured with the cs547 a conductivity probe by a campbell scientific inc logan utah usa data logger and used as a surrogate for tracer concentration voltz et al 2013 ward et al 2016 fig 2d shows the btcs measured by voltz et al 2013 for the four tests that were performed at different times in a long base flow recession period in 2010 these observations were used for evaluating the unsteady adels model and parameter estimation by using multiple tracer tests across a wide range of streamflow magnitudes over the base flow recession period we can better assess the skills and robustness of the unsteady model in capturing the effects of time varying streamflow on tracer transport 3 2 parameter estimation model parameters and their distributions are often identified by fitting model simulations to field observations from tracer tests we adapted the ats with unsteady adels implemented within it for forward simulations of transports and used the mcmc sampling technique for model parameter estimation see si figure s1 the parameters in the unsteady adels model to be estimated are shown in table 1 representing key hydrological and transport processes since the study reach is relatively small we assume that model parameters are homogeneous in space the cumulative distribution function cdf for travel time described by equally spaced quantiles eq 2 was represented in ats model as quantile differences δ t i t i 1 t i r 0 for i 1 n note that by parameterizing the hyporheic travel time through quantiles i e differences we maintained a shape free ttd which offers greater flexibility to encode complex hz physical hydrology through a fairly small number of parameters rathore et al 2021 a set of n 10 equally spaced quantiles were used to describe the ttd in the hz which was found to be efficient and effective in reproducing the tailing behavior in the observed btcs painter 2018 as a result a total number of 15 parameters were simultaneously estimated using mcmc in a bayesian framework by matching the simulated and observed btcs within the measurement uncertainty limits for mcmc runs we used pydream shockley et al 2017 a python implementation of the dream zs algorithm laloy and vrugt 2012 dream zs is one of the most advanced adaptions of the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream vrugt et al 2009 a multichain mcmc technique that adapt scale and orientation automatically making it efficient in sampling from challenging parameter spaces this efficient implementation provided our analyses the vigor to estimate shape free ttd together with other parameters in multiple mcmc experiments offering robust comparisons in the estimated joint distributions of model parameters in the following we provide details of the inverse problem and mcmc implementation inverse problem setup we adopted the bayesian framework to obtain the distribution of unsteady adels model parameters let θ be the vector of parameter set to be estimated conditioned on the observed concentration c o b s applying the bayes theorem 14 p θ c o b s p c o b s θ p θ in which p c o b s θ is the likelihood function describing the goodness of fit of the model to the data c o b s given the parameter set θ and probability p θ represents the prior knowledge about the parameters concentration at each time point on c o b s is assumed to follow gaussian distribution therefore p c o b s θ can be described as 15 p c o b s θ 1 2 π n σ exp 1 2 c o b s c s i m t σ 1 c o b s c s i m where σ is the covariance matrix of the measurement errors σ its determinant and n is the length of the observed concentration time series we assume uncorrelated measurement errors resulting in a diagonal σ matrix with measurement variances as diagonal elements at time point i the standard deviation σ i for measurement c i is modeled by σ i σ r e l c i σ a b s here σ r e l is the relative error representing the systematic component of the error resulting from factors including but not limited to changing field conditions during the experiment and instrument calibration and σ a b s is the absolute error representing the uncertainty introduced mainly due to the quantification limit of the instrument knapp and cirpka 2017 rathore et al 2021 mcmc implementation we used the mcmc sampling technique to obtain approximate distributions of parameters θ given the observed concentration c o b s samples were generated through random walk of mcmc chains in the parameter space guided by the performance criterion based on p θ c o b s following an evolutionary mechanism the next position in the random walk by a dream chain was proposed by taking the difference between existing positions of two randomly selected chains and the proposal was accepted or rejected based on metropolis criteria vrugt et al 2009 similar to rathore et al 2021 we set the number of differential evolution pairs equal to 2 gamma levels to 4 probability of gamma being equal to unity is set to 0 3 and snooker step is avoided by setting its probability equal to 0 wide initial parameter ranges were chosen with uniform sampling for forward model runs a forward model run included 4 simulations by unsteady adels ats one for each injection period with the same model parameters but different inputs e g injection mass and stream flow for each parameter estimation run we used five communicating chains in parallel and ran them until we had at least 10 000 generations per chain after all chains had converged the convergence was tested using the reduction factor r ˆ criteria by gelman and rubin 1992 which compares the variance of each chain to the pooled variance chains were considered converged when r ˆ was stable below 1 2 for all parameters si figure s2 the posterior distributions of the estimated parameters were then summarized using 10 000 samples providing a robust estimate of the distributions 3 3 results and discussion transport dynamics and model comparison fig 3 shows the comparison between the observed btcs gray dots for the four tracer tests and the simulated btcs obtained from the adels model the unsteady simulations are shown as colored bands based on an ensemble of btcs obtained from 600 parameter sets sampled from the posterior distribution for comparison we also include results from steady adels simulations solid black lines obtained by setting f q x t 1 in each of the test periods but with a test specific average discharge q the adels parameter set in the steady simulations was chosen to be the one with the largest likelihood of the 600 parameter sets see table s1 three distinct stages were evident in the observed and simulated btcs during the initial stage the concentrations rose dramatically as the tracer front arrived this stage was followed by a period about 48 h in which the concentrations fluctuated in response to changes in the streamflow during the final stage the concentration decreased as the tracer front passed and tracer mass left the hz back to the stream in this stage the long tails of the btcs indicate that there was a high degree of hyporheic exchange within the study reach although the unsteady model slightly underestimates the peak of concentration in test period 2 the fit between observed and unsteady simulated concentration as quantified by the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index nash and sutcliffe 1970 is very good greater than 0 90 for each of the four simulated tracer tests highlighting the ability of the proposed framework in quantifying the hz and channel controls on the transport of tracer in the stream corridor under unsteady flow stream flow magnitude was significantly different among the four tests and varied with significant diurnal signal during two of the tests fig 2c which had a strong influence on tracer concentration both in the channel and hz specifically at low streamflow magnitudes periods 3 and 4 exhibited a coherent signal of the diurnal cycle in observed streamflow and the btcs of the tracer in both the plateaus and tails fig 3c d these fluctuations occur primarily due to the daily cycle of evapotranspiration in the watershed wondzell et al 2010 the diurnal fluctuation of the observed btc during period 4 along the tail 6 to 7 days reflects the effects of changes in dilution as solute returns from the hz to a channel with fluctuating discharge the signal of diurnal cycle shown in tests 1 and 2 is weak owing to the relatively high magnitudes of streamflow during those periods fig 3a b however streamflow is decreasing during those tests which causes a slight upward drift of the plateau concentration that is reproduced by the unsteady adels simulations but not by the steady adels simulation while the rising limbs of the btcs are quite similar the falling limbs are very different in particular the slopes the of the falling limbs decrease from periods 1 to 4 reflecting greater significance of hyporheic exchange relative to downstream movement in the lower flow conditions the results presented in periods 3 and 4 show that the unsteady model captures quite well the fluctuations e g diurnal cycle in the corresponding btcs in response to changes in streamflow whereas the steady model does not this illustrates the usefulness of the unsteady model for simulating the complex dynamics of transport in the channel and hz however the two adels models are fairly comparable when the short term fluctuations in the streamflow are weak e g streamflow in periods 1 and 2 overall the good fit shown in our results across all periods demonstrates the skills and robustness of the unsteady model to capture the effects of time varying flow on tracer transport parameter identifiability and distributions the

the median travel time in the hz t 50 i 1 5 δ t i are presented in fig 4 metrics of these distributions are given in table 2 best fit parameters and standard deviations the t 50 indicates the middle value of the time interval that solute resides in the hz and is therefore more intuitive to interpret compared to quantile differences in general the obtained parameters lie in the expected ranges and most of the parameter distributions exhibit significant single peak in the histogram unimodality showing that the parameters are uniquely identified and well constrained by the observed btcs among parameters β d shows slightly higher uncertainty compared to other parameters but it still clearly has a preferred range with a central tendency these results demonstrate that inverse modeling using unsteady adels successfully extracted the information from the imprints of the channel and hz processes on the observed btcs the ranges of the estimated α 0 and d 0 were also found consistent with those shown in previous studies rathore et al 2021 ward et al 2015 with median estimates of α 0 9 4 1 0 5 1 s and d 0 0 015 m 2 s the median t 50 is approximately 6 1 h which is longer than values reported in the study by rathore et al 2021 that study focused on a reach characterized by sand dominated bed sediments that may be expected to have shorter travel times the bivariate distributions of the 6 key parameters also reveal interactions between parameters as a result of trade offs in the process representation first almost no correlation between d 0 and the other 4 parameters except β d is observed demonstrated by the circular shapes of the joint distributions this is consistent with past work estimating model parameters under steady state flow condition rathore et al 2021 second the joint distribution between α 0 and β ν exhibits a linear correlation where higher hyporheic exchange corresponds to lower hz velocity scaling factor as small perturbations around the mode of the distribution despite noteworthy interaction distributions are well constrained by the observed btcs and identified uniquely finally a negative and relatively weak correlation is observed between α 0 and t 50 implying that higher hyporheic exchange rate corresponds to shorter travel times through the hz the advantage and flexibility of the shape free over parametric approaches have been demonstrated to reduce the ambiguity of model parameters particularly when the reach is short as in our study knapp and cirpka 2017 rathore et al 2021 indeed the shape free ttd in unsteady adels can capture the complexity in hz physical hydrology thus predicting all parts of the btc fig 5 shows an ensemble of 600 estimated travel time cdfs obtained from mcmc simulations the results reveal relatively long travel time approximately 5 7 days for the 90th percentile of the ttd which is as long as the duration of several tests by construction tracer tests cannot determine travel times on the order or longer than the duration of the experiment itself on the other hand the 10th percentile of the ttd is much shorter in the range of minutes to less than an hour the cdfs generally encompass a spread of only 10 15 or less of the most likely value this result indicates a high reliability of the fitted ttd parameters from the mcmc simulations model formulation transport of solutes in stream corridors subject to unsteady flow has been simulated in models with a transient storage component runkel et al 1998 in these tsm models the hyporheic exchange coefficient α is assumed to be constant and unaffected by temporal changes in streamflow discharge q other assumptions in the tsm formulation are that water in the storage zone is well mixed and immobile relative to water in the main channel bencala and walters 1983 these assumptions are appropriate when the tsm is relatively small and exchange between the channel and streambed is diffusively controlled when exchange and transport are dominated by advection solute concentrations will vary along the hyporheic streamlines and exchange may depend on channel discharge as in the advective pumping model in the unsteady adels model presented here we were able to incorporate these relationships by explicitly formulating α and other hz parameters as a function of streamflow q this improvement unlocks new possibilities for studying transport in more complex river corridors under unsteady flow conditions 4 conclusions an important challenge in modeling transport of nutrients carbon and contaminants in stream river networks at river basin scales is to simultaneously represent the effects of diverse flowpaths through the hyporheic zone and fine scale gradients in geochemical conditions along those flowpaths the multiscale adels framework addresses that challenge by combining lagrangian subgrid models for reactive transport in the hyporheic zone with hyporheic travel time distributions to quantify flowpath diversity here we extended the approach to accommodate unsteady stream discharge a critical step in making the approach appropriate for watershed scale reactive transport applications the unsteady adels model approximates hyporheic flowpaths as having fixed trajectories but with time varying flow speed consistent with bedform pumping models the unsteady version also makes use of widely used hydraulic geometry scaling arguments to evaluate the performance of the unsteady adels model with those physically motivated approximations we evaluated it against previously published data from four tracer tests in a headwater mountain stream in the h j andrews experimental forest voltz et al 2013 ward et al 2016 that we were able to fit a single model to the four time varying tests across a wide range of streamflow magnitudes demonstrates that our multiscale framework is transferable to different flow conditions and effective at reproducing tracer tests moreover the results demonstrate that key model parameters including the full joint distributions of parameters can be estimated from tracer test breakthrough curves while the focus of this study was nonreacting tracer on a small single reach our multiscale model is applicable to general reactive transport at larger scales and is available in the open source ats code jan et al 2021 an obvious direction for future work is to test the unsteady adels model at river network scales another important direction for future work is to integrate the multiscale river stream corridor model into full three dimensional watershed models which will enable the representation of biogeochemical effects of overbank flooding longer range hyporheic flowpaths and regional scale groundwater inflows that integrated model will represent a powerful new multiscale capability to model watershed scale reactive transport without ad hoc upscaling of fine scale biogeochemical processes in hz hotspots credit authorship contribution statement phong v v

salimi et al 2016 applied the swat model and the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm for simulating runoff in shafaroud watershed in this paper we focus on runoff predictions in basins with

et al 2019 swain and patra 2017 teutschbein et al 2018 han et al 2020 yoon et al 2022 zhang et al 2015 in practice there is another case in which the data e g runoff observations is limited here limited means that the data is not enough for training or fine tuning a data driven model e g a new gauged basin we call it runoff predictions with limited data pld or runoff predictions in new gauged basins pnb the difference between pnb and pub is that the new gauged basins can provide some data e g runoff observations while the un gauged basins cannot in this paper we focus on pld or pnb in recent years models based on recurrent neural networks e g lstm and gated recurrent unit networks have been developed rapidly in rainfall runoff modeling xiang et al 2020 xie et al 2022 yin et al 2021 kratzert et al 2019b lees et al 2021 solgi et al 2021 salloom et al 2021 nourani and behfar 2021 gao et al 2022 yin et al 2022b kao et al 2021 kratzert et al 2018 however due to the auto regression or the recurrent neural network based structure of the lstm two nonadjacent positions or cells cannot be connected directly yin et al 2022a therefore the lstm based models have low level of flexibility based on this consideration we propose a simple transformer based rainfall runoff model named rrs former the transformer is proposed by vaswani et al 2017 for the first time and has been applied in many fields due to its excellent performance the main part of rrs former is attention modules in which two arbitrary positions can be connected directly its structure is totally different from the lstm based rainfall runoff models and our rrs former can directly strengthen or weaken the connections of one position to the others therefore compared with the lstm based models the rrs former has much higher level of flexibility in this paper we would like to show the power of rrs former and also that of the proposed rr former yin et al 2022a for pnb or pld besides we also appeal more attentions on transformer based architectures in rainfall runoff modeling in this paper we employ the camels dataset and test the performance of transformer based models and that of lstm based models as usual the performance is tested by using the k fold validation for example the basins are divided into n groups the model is trained by using data of n 1 groups and the rest group is used to test the performance actually this k fold validation has uncertainty more or less first the results may be different when the basins are grouped differently second this testing approach can show the performance for pnb entirely however we cannot analyze performance of the models for a specific hydrological unit in this paper we give another different way to test performance for pnb we train the models by using the basins in three hydrological units and then test the performance using basins in the rest one hydrological unit this way is beneficial for analyzing the performance for a specific hydrological unit we call it unit fold approach in this paper we test the performance using both the k fold validation and the unit fold validation the contributions of this paper are shown as follows first we propose a simple transformer based rainfall runoff model named rrs former with much less parameters and less training time compared with rr former second we apply our rrs former and rr former for pnb study their transfer ability and show the performance in the camels dataset third to test the performance we propose the unit fold approach which has several advantages this paper is organized as follows section 2 is about the rrs former the four hydrological units in camels dataset and experimental design are introduced in section 3 section 4 is about results and discussions section 5 concludes this paper 2 methods 2 1 rrs former in this paper we propose a simple transformer based rainfall runoff model named rrs former its structure is shown in fig 1 and we describe it as follows before the main layers the structure of rrs former contains two modules an input transformation module and a position embedding module usually the input dimension differs from the model dimension by the input transformation module i e a linear operation the input dimension is converted to meet the model dimension the position embedding module is used to add position information because the transformer based models do not have natural time labels then the results through these two modules are sent to layer 1 of the main layers layer 1 has two sub layers including the multi head self attention layers and position wise fully connected networks with three layers here the main layers include 4 layers totally layer 1 layer 2 layer 3 and layer 4 the output of layer 1 is sent to layer 2 and the case is same for layer 3 and layer 4 the output of layer 4 is sent to a fully connected network and the output of the fully connected network is the runoff prediction the multi head self attention layer is the key to rrs former first we introduce attention mechanism briefly and then the multi head self attention layer attention mechanism is just like focusing on a target area in an image it is a weighted sum in which different weights are assigned to different positions by considering how important they are assume that there are a set of key value pairs k v and queries q with the dimensions d k d v and d q respectively by measuring the similarity between the queries and keys the weights are assigned to the values and then the output can be described as 1 attn q k v s o f t max q k t d k v where q is a matrix by packing a set of queries vector q together the cases are the same to k and v note that if q k and v are linearly transformed from the same sequence it is self attention by multi head self attention the model can use multiple heads to deal with different features from many representation subspaces simultaneously that is each head corresponds to a self attention sub module and multiple heads can be viewed as a combination we present the pseudocode of our rrs former in algorithm 1 2 2 rrs former vs rr former as mentioned in yin et al 2022a our rr former is based on an encoder decoder structure and has several important modules including the self attention module the cross attention module the masked attention module the multi head attention module and so on we introduced those modules in detail in yin et al 2022a and do not repeat them here compared with the structure of rr former the proposed rrs former is simpler which is not based on an encoder decoder structure or a sequence to sequence structure besides rrs former does not have the masked attention module or the cross attention module but has the multi head self attention module due to its simpler structure rrs former has less parameters compared with rr former although simply rrs former may have better performance for one day ahead runoff predictions sometimes a simpler model may perform better because it suits for a simpler case better so rr former is a better choice when we deal with multi day ahead runoff predictions and rrs former suits for one day ahead runoff predictions which is simpler than multi day ahead runoff predictions well these two transformer based models have their own characteristics and we can choose them based on different tasks 3 dataset and experimental setup 3 1 dataset the camels dataset in the united states addor et al 2017 newman et al 2015 is employed which is a big dataset containing 674 basins for each basin this dataset contains meteorological forcings static attributes and runoff observations at daily timescale newman et al 2014 both the daily runoff observations and the meteorological forcings range from october 1 1980 to december 31 2014 both our transformer based models i e rrs former and rr former and the benchmark models use 5 meteorological forcings and 27 static attributes listed in table 1 which are the same as those used in kratzert et al 2019b the camels dataset has 18 hydrological units and we choose 4 of them including 241 basins in this paper these 4 units are numbered 01 03 11 and 17 as shown in fig 2 we choose the same four units as in kratzert et al 2018 and in yin et al 2022b which covers a wide range of different hydrological conditions and thus the performance can be tested statistically and comprehensively by using these units besides employing 4 units can limit the computational costs we introduce the hydrological conditions of these 4 units briefly as follows the new england region numbered 01 locates in the northeast which contains 27 more or less homogeneous basins the arkansas white red region numbered 11 is in the center of the contiguous united states which has 32 basins within this region attributes have a high variance and strong gradient from east to west the other two hydrological units named the south atlantic gulf region numbered 03 and the pacific northwest region numbered 17 have 92 basins and 91 basins respectively these two regions have disparate hydro climatic conditions the former contains more homogeneous basins and is not influenced by snow while the new england region is influenced besides compared with the other three regions it has higher daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature and vapor pressure in statistics the latter spanning from the pacific coast till the rocky mountains exhibits a high variance of attributes across the basins it contains very humid basins with more than 3000 mm yr precipitation close to the pacific coast and very arid basins in the south east of this region we show the huc based statistics i e the mean and standard deviation about those five meteorological forcings averaged over all basins in a specific region in table 2 3 2 experimental setup usually the performance of pnb or pub is tested by using the k fold validation in this paper for k fold validation we divide 241 basins into 5 groups randomly i e k is set to be 5 besides we propose the unit fold approach to test the performance as follows we train the models by using the basins in three hydrological units and then test the performance using basins in the rest one hydrological unit specifically we train the models by using the training set the hydrological units numbered 01 03 and 11 and then test the performance by using the testing set the hydrological unit numbered 17 the case is similar when the hydrological units numbered 01 03 and 11 are respectively used as the testing set the training set is from october 1 1980 to september 30 1995 the validation set is from october 1 1995 to september 30 2000 the testing set is from october 1 2000 to september 31 2014 besides the rrs former rr former lstm ss 1 and ea lstm use the same inputs that is the comparison is fair we set the batch size the dropout rate and the learning rate as 512 0 1 and 0 001 respectively the other hyperparameters can be found in algorithm 1 3 3 evaluation measures benchmarks we use four evaluation measures the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the root mean square error rmse the log nse and the absolute top 2 prediction error tpe 2 the nse rmse and the log nse are defined as 2 nse 1 i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 3 rmse i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 n 4 log nse 1 i 1 n log y i log y ˆ i 2 i 1 n log y i log y 2 where y i is the runoff observation at time i y ˆ i means the runoff prediction and y is the average of n runoff observations the tpe 2 measures the accuracy of peak flow prediction which is defined as 5 tpe 2 j 1 h y ˆ j y j j 1 h y j where y 1 y 2 y h y j is the j th ordered runoff observation y ˆ j is the prediction of y j and h denotes the number of the top 2 peaks the benchmarks include the lstm ss 1 model in yin et al 2022b and the ea lstm model in kratzert et al 2019b 4 results and discussion the performance of different models including rrs former rr former lstm ss 1 and ea lstm is evaluated by using the nse the rmse the log nse and the tpe 2 we want to show the following two points first we would like to show the power of our transformer based models i e rrs former and rr former in pnb and give the upper bounds of those four models second besides the k fold validation we propose the unit fold approach to test the performance and show the findings 4 1 power of transformer based models as mentioned we use both the k fold validation and the unit fold approach to test the performance the performance of those models by using the k fold validation is given in table 3 we can see that both our rrs former and our rr former have better performance compared with those two lstm based models i e lstm ss 1 and ea lstm from nse and rmse for the unit fold approach we employ four hydrological units i e the hydrological units numbered 01 03 11 and 17 where three of them are used to train the models and the rest one unit is used to test the performance of those models we provide two kinds of results here the first one is about overall performance of rrs former rr former ea lstm and lstm ss 1 which is tested on four hydrological units entirely shown in table 4 the second one is about the performance tested on four hydrological units respectively shown in table 5 from table 4 we can see that our proposed transformer based models i e rrs former and rr former outperform those two lstm based models i e ea lstm and lstm ss 1 in both nse median and mean and rmse median and mean furthermore we provide the nse cdfs of those four models in fig 3 in table 5 we show the results on each hydrological unit and our rrs former has best nse median in three hydrological units numbered 01 03 and 11 among those four units compared with rr former which has an encoder decoder structure rrs former has better performance nse median rmse median and tpe 2 median in these three hydrological units with a simpler structure and less parameters sometimes the simpler one suits better for the simple case one day ahead runoff predictions the nse cdfs of rrs former rr former ea lstm and lstm ss 1 in each hydrological unit are shown in fig 4 moreover we provide the performance upper bounds of rrs former rr former ea lstm and lstm ss 1 respectively different from training the models on three hydrological units and testing the performance in the rest hydrological unit we train the models in all four hydrological units and then test them we call it all units modeling the results are shown in table 6 which indicates that our transformer based models are good at all units rainfall runoff modeling and outperform the lstm based models here we want to mention that the proposed transformer based models are based on attention mechanisms entirely which differ from lstm based models completely the results show that the transformer based models have more advantages in rainfall runoff modeling and can find better representations compared with lstm based models therefore we appeal more researches on such advanced structures in rainfall runoff modeling 4 2 unit fold and new findings as mentioned we propose the unit fold to test the performance and the results are shown in table 5 and fig 4 based on it we can analyze the performance for a specific hydrological unit and give the following three points in this subsection we focus on the nse and the rmse that is the performance in this subsection refers to the nse and the rmse first the results of our rrs former for unit fold is consistent with its results for all units modeling in table 6 generally our rrs former and those two lstm based models have similar order of performance in all units modeling that is they perform best in unit 17 and then unit 01 unit 03 and unit 11 from table 5 we can see that our rrs former has the same order of performance it does make sense that the performance by all units modeling is better than that by the unit fold the above also shows that our rrs former is reliable since a it has the same order of performance by the unit fold and by all units modeling and b its performance by the unit fold is worse but slightly worse than that by all units modeling note that the two lstm based benchmark models i e ea lstm and lstm ss 1 do not have such a similar case these two models perform better in unit 11 than that in unit 03 which is not consistent with the order of performance by their all units modeling second from the results in table 5 we can see that our rrs former can learn the representations of rainfall runoff behavior well from three hydrological units and then it can transfer well in the rest unit here we focus on unit 03 ea lstm and lstm ss 1 do not have good performance by unit fold in this unit and actually their performance is much worse than ours thus the results indicate that the two lstm based models are not reliable since a the order of performance by all units modeling and that by the unit fold are not consistent and b they have bad performance by unit fold in unit 03 however their performance by all units modeling in unit 03 is good in conclusion our rrs former is good at regional rainfall runoff modeling and is more reliable third among these four hydrological units the runoff prediction in unit 11 i e the arkansas white red region is more difficult than that in other units as shown in table 6 in reality this is also the case because attributes have a high variance and a strong gradient from east to west as mentioned in kratzert et al 2018 our rrs former is consistent with it while the lstm based models are not furthermore compared table 5 with table 6 we find that ea lstm has larger nse median by unit fold than by all units modeling in unit 01 which does not make sense therefore our rrs former is more reliable and is a better choice for pnb 4 3 pros and cons of rrs former in this paper we use the log nse to measure the accuracy of low flow predictions of the models the results show that our rr former achieves the best performance on low flow predictions however rrs former does not perform well on transfer ability of low flow predictions especially in unit 17 as shown in table 5 in table 6 we can see that rrs former has good log nse in all units modeling which performs better than the lstm based models although worse than the rr former so rrs former has good performance on regional rainfall runoff modeling but its transfer ability of low flow predictions needs improvement this will be our future work in our opinion adding a term focusing on low flow predictions e g log mse to the loss function may be a choice we also use the tpe 2 to measure the accuracy of peak flow predictions of the models the transformer based models have better performance than the lstm based models in all units modeling in table 6 rrs former has best tpe 2 median in unit 01 03 and 11 as shown in table 5 which indicates that it has good transfer ability of peak flow predictions rrs former and rr former are transformer based rainfall runoff models and have their own advantages the results by those four evaluation measures show that neither is dominant rrs former is simpler than rr former and we show their parameters and computational time in table 7 we can see that rrs former has much less parameters and less training time compared with rr former therefore rrs former is a good choice under limited computational resources 5 conclusions in this paper we proposed a simple transformer based rainfall runoff model named rrs former and then applied both rrs former and the previously proposed rr former for pnb to show the regional modeling ability and the transfer ability of the transformer based rainfall runoff models we tested the performance by both the k fold validation and the proposed unit fold validation in four hydrological units from the camels dataset using nse rmse log nse and tpe 2 we conclude the main findings as follows generally both our rrs former and rr former have better performance compared with those two lstm based models i e lstm ss 1 and ea lstm shown by nse and rmse that is the transformer based models have better regional modeling ability and transfer ability thus they suit for pnb better the tpe 2 and the log nse are used to measure the accuracy of peak flow predictions and that of low flow predictions respectively for peak flow predictions the transformer based models have higher accuracy in all units modeling and have better transfer ability in three units compared with those two lstm based models for low flow predictions rr former performs best among all models rrs former is good at regional modeling but does not perform well on transfer ability of low flow predictions compared with rr former rrs former has much less parameters and needs less training time except for the low flow predictions rrs former has competitive and even better performance compared with rr former in the future we may train a better rrs former model by considering the low flow predictions in its loss function furthermore we will focus on a physically informed transformer based model which has better performance and physical explanations credit

salimi et al 2016 applied the swat model and the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm for simulating runoff in shafaroud watershed in this paper we focus on runoff predictions in basins with scarce data for instance pub is not solved well bloschl et al 2019 and still has many attentions in recent years jahanshahi et al 2021 desai and ouarda 2021 rasheed et al 2022 gauch et al 2021 milukow et al 2019 swain and patra 2017 teutschbein et al 2018 han et al 2020 yoon et al 2022 zhang et al 2015 in practice there is another case in which the data e g runoff observations is limited here limited means that the data is not enough for training or fine tuning a data driven model e g a new gauged basin we call it runoff predictions with limited data pld or runoff predictions in new gauged basins pnb the difference between pnb and pub is that the new gauged basins can provide some data e g runoff observations while the un gauged basins cannot in this paper we focus on pld or pnb in recent years models based on recurrent neural networks e g lstm and gated recurrent unit networks have been developed rapidly in rainfall runoff modeling xiang et al 2020 xie et al 2022 yin et al 2021 kratzert et al 2019b lees et al 2021 solgi et al 2021 salloom et al 2021 nourani and behfar 2021 gao et al 2022 yin et al 2022b kao et al 2021 kratzert et al 2018 however due to the auto regression or the recurrent neural network based structure of the lstm two nonadjacent positions or cells cannot be connected directly yin et al 2022a therefore the lstm based models have low level of flexibility based on this consideration we propose a simple transformer based rainfall runoff model named rrs former the transformer is proposed by vaswani et al 2017 for the first time and has been applied in many fields due to its excellent performance the main part of rrs former is attention modules in which two arbitrary positions can be connected directly its structure is totally different from the lstm based rainfall runoff models and our rrs former can directly strengthen or weaken the connections of one position to the others therefore compared with the lstm based models the rrs former has much higher level of flexibility in this paper we would like to show the power of rrs former and also that of the proposed rr former yin et al 2022a for pnb or pld besides we also appeal more attentions on transformer based architectures in rainfall runoff modeling in this paper we employ the camels dataset and test the performance of transformer based models and that of lstm based models as usual the performance is tested by using the k fold validation for example the basins are divided into n groups the model is trained by using data of n 1 groups and the rest group is used to test the performance actually this k fold validation has uncertainty more or less first the results may be different when the basins are grouped differently second this testing approach can show the performance for pnb entirely however we cannot analyze performance of the models for a specific hydrological unit in this paper we give another different way to test performance for pnb we train the models by using the basins in three hydrological units and then test the performance using basins in the rest one hydrological unit this way is beneficial for analyzing the performance for a specific hydrological unit we call it unit fold approach in this paper we test the performance using both the k fold validation and the unit fold validation the contributions of this paper are shown as follows first we propose a simple transformer based rainfall runoff model named rrs former with much less parameters and less training time compared with rr former second we apply our rrs former and rr former for pnb study their transfer ability and show the performance in the camels dataset third to test the performance we propose the unit fold approach which has several advantages this paper is organized as follows section 2 is about the rrs former the four hydrological units in camels dataset and experimental design are introduced in section 3 section 4 is about results and discussions section 5 concludes this paper 2 methods 2 1 rrs former in this paper we propose a simple transformer based rainfall runoff model named rrs former its structure is shown in fig 1 and we describe it as follows before the main layers the structure of rrs former contains two modules an input transformation module and a position embedding module usually the input dimension differs from the model dimension by the input transformation module i e a linear operation the input dimension is converted to meet the model dimension the position embedding module is used to add position information because the transformer based models do not have natural time labels then the results through these two modules are sent to layer 1 of the main layers layer 1 has two sub layers including the multi head self attention layers and position wise fully connected networks with three layers here the main layers include 4 layers totally layer 1 layer 2 layer 3 and layer 4 the output of layer 1 is sent to layer 2 and the case is same for layer 3 and layer 4 the output of layer 4 is sent to a fully connected network and the output of the fully connected network is the runoff prediction the multi head self attention layer is the key to rrs former first we introduce attention mechanism briefly and then the multi head self attention layer attention mechanism is just like focusing on a target area in an image it is a weighted sum in which different weights are assigned to different positions by considering how important they are assume that there are a set of key value pairs k v and queries q with the dimensions d k d v and d q respectively by measuring the similarity between the queries and keys the weights are assigned to the values and then the output can be described as 1 attn q k v s o f t max q k t d k v where q is a matrix by packing a set of queries vector q together the cases are the same to k and v note that if q k and v are linearly transformed from the same sequence it is self attention by multi head self attention the model can use multiple heads to deal with different features from many representation subspaces simultaneously that is each head corresponds to a self attention sub module and multiple heads can be viewed as a combination we present the pseudocode of our rrs former in algorithm 1 2 2 rrs former vs rr former as mentioned in yin et al 2022a our rr former is based on an encoder decoder structure and has several important modules including the self attention module the cross attention module the masked attention module the multi head attention module and so on we introduced those modules in detail in yin et al 2022a and do not repeat them here compared with the structure of rr former the proposed rrs former is simpler which is not based on an encoder decoder structure or a sequence to sequence structure besides rrs former does not have the masked attention module or the cross attention module but has the multi head self attention module due to its simpler structure rrs former has less parameters compared with rr former although simply rrs former may have better performance for one day ahead runoff predictions sometimes a simpler model may perform better because it suits for a simpler case better so rr former is a better choice when we deal with multi day ahead runoff predictions and rrs former suits for one day ahead runoff predictions which is simpler than multi day ahead runoff predictions well these two transformer based models have their own characteristics and we can choose them based on different tasks 3 dataset and experimental setup 3 1 dataset the camels dataset in the united states addor et al 2017 newman et al 2015 is employed which is a big dataset containing 674 basins for each basin this dataset contains meteorological forcings static attributes and runoff observations at daily timescale newman et al 2014 both the daily runoff observations and the meteorological forcings range from october 1 1980 to december 31 2014 both our transformer based models i e rrs former and rr former and the benchmark models use 5 meteorological forcings and 27 static attributes listed in table 1 which are the same as those used in kratzert et al 2019b the camels dataset has 18 hydrological units and we choose 4 of them including 241 basins in this paper these 4 units are numbered 01 03 11 and 17 as shown in fig 2 we choose the same four units as in kratzert et al 2018 and in yin et al 2022b which covers a wide range of different hydrological conditions and thus the performance can be tested statistically and comprehensively by using these units besides employing 4 units can limit the computational costs we introduce the hydrological conditions of these 4 units briefly as follows the new england region numbered 01 locates in the northeast which contains 27 more or less homogeneous basins the arkansas white red region numbered 11 is in the center of the contiguous united states which has 32 basins within this region attributes have a high variance and strong gradient from east to west the other two hydrological units named the south atlantic gulf region numbered 03 and the pacific northwest region numbered 17 have 92 basins and 91 basins respectively these two regions have disparate hydro climatic conditions the former contains more homogeneous basins and is not influenced by snow while the new england region is influenced besides compared with the other three regions it has higher daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature and vapor pressure in statistics the latter spanning from the pacific coast till the rocky mountains exhibits a high variance of attributes across the basins it contains very humid basins with more than 3000 mm yr precipitation close to the pacific coast and very arid basins in the south east of this region we show the huc based statistics i e the mean and standard deviation about those five meteorological forcings averaged over all basins in a specific region in table 2 3 2 experimental setup usually the performance of pnb or pub is tested by using the k fold validation in this paper for k fold validation we divide 241 basins into 5 groups randomly i e k is set to be 5 besides we propose the unit fold approach to test the performance as follows we train the models by using the basins in three hydrological units and then test the performance using basins in the rest one hydrological unit specifically we train the models by using the training set the hydrological units numbered 01 03 and 11 and then test the performance by using the testing set the hydrological unit numbered 17 the case is similar when the hydrological units numbered 01 03 and 11 are respectively used as the testing set the training set is from october 1 1980 to september 30 1995 the validation set is from october 1 1995 to september 30 2000 the testing set is from october 1 2000 to september 31 2014 besides the rrs former rr former lstm ss 1 and ea lstm use the same inputs that is the comparison is fair we set the batch size the dropout rate and the learning rate as 512 0 1 and 0 001 respectively the other hyperparameters can be found in algorithm 1 3 3 evaluation measures benchmarks we use four evaluation measures the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the root mean square error rmse the log nse and the absolute top 2 prediction error tpe 2 the nse rmse and the log nse are defined as 2 nse 1 i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 3 rmse i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 n 4 log nse 1 i 1 n log y i log y ˆ i 2 i 1 n log y i log y 2 where y i is the runoff observation at time i y ˆ i means the runoff prediction and y is the average of n runoff observations the tpe 2 measures the accuracy of peak flow prediction which is defined as 5 tpe 2 j 1 h y ˆ j y j j 1 h y j where y 1 y 2 y h y j is the j th ordered runoff observation y ˆ j is the prediction of y j and h denotes the number of the top 2 peaks the benchmarks include the lstm ss 1 model in yin et al 2022b and the ea lstm model in kratzert et al 2019b 4 results and discussion the performance of different models including rrs former rr former lstm ss 1 and ea lstm is evaluated by using the nse the rmse the log nse and the tpe 2 we want to show the following two points first we would like to show the power of our transformer based models i e rrs former and rr former in pnb and give the upper bounds of those four models second besides the k fold validation we propose the unit fold approach to test the performance and show the findings 4 1 power of transformer based models as mentioned we use both the k fold validation and the unit fold approach to test the performance the performance of those models by using the k fold validation is given in table 3 we can see that both our rrs former and our rr former have better performance compared with those two lstm based models i e lstm ss 1 and ea lstm from nse and rmse for the unit fold approach we employ four hydrological units i e the hydrological units numbered 01 03 11 and 17 where three of them are used to train the models and the rest one unit is used to test the performance of those models we provide two kinds of results here the first one is about overall performance of rrs former rr former ea lstm and lstm ss 1 which is tested on four hydrological units entirely shown in table 4 the second one is about the performance tested on four hydrological units respectively shown in table 5 from table 4 we can see that our proposed transformer based models i e rrs former and rr former outperform those two lstm based models i e ea lstm and lstm ss 1 in both nse median and mean and rmse median and mean furthermore we provide the nse cdfs of those four models in fig 3 in table 5 we show the results on each hydrological unit and our rrs former has best nse median in three hydrological units numbered 01 03 and 11 among those four units compared with rr former which has an encoder decoder structure rrs former has better performance nse median rmse median and tpe 2 median in these three hydrological units with a simpler structure and less parameters sometimes the simpler one suits better for the simple case one day ahead runoff predictions the nse cdfs of rrs former rr former ea lstm and lstm ss 1 in each hydrological unit are shown in fig 4 moreover we provide the performance upper bounds of rrs former rr former ea lstm and lstm ss 1 respectively different from training the models on three hydrological units and testing the performance in the rest hydrological unit we train the models in all four hydrological units and then test them we call it all units modeling the results are shown in table 6 which indicates that our transformer based models are good at all units rainfall runoff modeling and outperform the lstm based models here we want to mention that the proposed transformer based models are based on attention mechanisms entirely which differ from lstm based models completely the results show that the transformer based models have more advantages in rainfall runoff modeling and can find better representations compared with lstm based models therefore we appeal more researches on such advanced structures in rainfall runoff modeling 4 2 unit fold and new findings as mentioned we propose the unit fold to test the performance and the results are shown in table 5 and fig 4 based on it we can analyze the performance for a specific hydrological unit and give the following three points in this subsection we focus on the nse and the rmse that is the performance in this subsection refers to the nse and the rmse first the results of our rrs former for unit fold is consistent with its results for all units modeling in table 6 generally our rrs former and those two lstm based models have similar order of performance in all units modeling that is they perform best in unit 17 and then unit 01 unit 03 and unit 11 from table 5 we can see that our rrs former has the same order of performance it does make sense that the performance by all units modeling is better than that by the unit fold the above also shows that our rrs former is reliable since a it has the same order of performance by the unit fold and by all units modeling and b its performance by the unit fold is worse but slightly worse than that by all units modeling note that the two lstm based benchmark models i e ea lstm and lstm ss 1 do not have such a similar case these two models perform better in unit 11 than that in unit 03 which is not consistent with the order of performance by their all units modeling second from the results in table 5 we can see that our rrs former can learn the representations of rainfall runoff behavior well from three hydrological units and then it can transfer well in the rest unit here we focus on unit 03 ea lstm and lstm ss 1 do not have good performance by unit fold in this unit and actually their performance is much worse than ours thus the results indicate that the two lstm based models are not reliable since a the order of performance by all units modeling and that by the unit fold are not consistent and b they have bad performance by unit fold in unit 03 however their performance by all units modeling in unit 03 is good in conclusion our rrs former is good at regional rainfall runoff modeling and is more reliable third among these four hydrological units the runoff prediction in unit 11 i e the arkansas white red region is more difficult than that in other units as shown in table 6 in reality this is also the case because attributes have a high variance and a strong gradient from east to west as mentioned in kratzert et al 2018 our rrs former is consistent with it while the lstm based models are not furthermore compared table 5 with table 6 we find that ea lstm has larger nse median by unit fold than by all units modeling in unit 01 which does not make sense therefore our rrs former is more reliable and is a better choice for pnb 4 3 pros and cons of rrs former in this paper we use the log nse to measure the accuracy of low flow predictions of the models the results show that our rr former achieves the best performance on low flow predictions however rrs former does not perform well on transfer ability of low flow predictions especially in unit 17 as shown in table 5 in table 6 we can see that rrs former has good log nse in all units modeling which performs better than the lstm based models although worse than the rr former so rrs former has good performance on regional rainfall runoff modeling but its transfer ability of low flow predictions needs improvement this will be our future work in our opinion adding a term focusing on low flow predictions e g log mse to the loss function may be a choice we also use the tpe 2 to measure the accuracy of peak flow predictions of the models the transformer based models have better performance than the lstm based models in all units modeling in table 6 rrs former has best tpe 2 median in unit 01 03 and 11 as shown in table 5 which indicates that it has good transfer ability of peak flow predictions rrs former and rr former are transformer based rainfall runoff models and have their own advantages the results by those four evaluation measures show that neither is dominant rrs former is simpler than rr former and we show their parameters and computational time in table 7 we can see that rrs former has much less parameters and less training time compared with rr former therefore rrs former is a good choice under limited computational resources 5 conclusions in this paper we proposed a simple transformer based rainfall runoff model named rrs former and then applied both rrs former and the previously proposed rr former for pnb to show the regional modeling ability and the transfer ability of the transformer based rainfall runoff models we tested the performance by both the k fold validation and the proposed unit fold validation in four hydrological units from the camels dataset using nse rmse log nse and tpe 2 we conclude the main findings as follows generally both our rrs former and rr former have better performance compared with those two lstm based models i e lstm ss 1 and ea lstm shown by nse and rmse that is the transformer based models have better regional modeling ability and transfer ability thus they suit for pnb better the tpe 2 and the log nse are used to measure the accuracy of peak flow predictions and that of low flow predictions respectively for peak flow predictions the transformer based models have higher accuracy in all units modeling and have better transfer ability in three units compared with those two lstm based models for low flow predictions rr former performs best among all models rrs former is good at regional modeling but does not perform well on transfer ability of low flow predictions compared with rr former rrs former has much less parameters and needs less training time except for the low flow predictions rrs former has competitive and even better performance compared with rr former in the future we may train a better rrs former model by considering the low flow predictions in its loss function furthermore we will focus on a physically informed transformer based model which has better performance and physical explanations credit

brackish water dominated by ca hco3 low mineralized water with the presence of ptes and freshwater in its natural state the main controlling factors of hydrogeochemistry are evaporative crystallization and water rock interactions fe mn pb and cd were detected in groundwater in the study area at levels exceeding world health organization who parameter values and the highly toxic trace metal tl was detected at levels up to 20 μg l the assessment of the applicability of the dgt technique to groundwater systems showed that reliable dgt detection results could be obtained under neutral or alkaline conditions at low mn and cd levels this study highlights the evolution of the groundwater hydrogeochemistry under the combined influences of human activities such as mining and remediation management in particular the release of ptes can affect human health while the adoption of in situ dgt technology can provide strong support for studying these issues keywords groundwater acid mine

pyrite mining areas is based on dominant natural processes including water rock interactions weathering evaporation mineral dissolution and ion exchange reactions sunkari et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 wang et al 2023 yuan et al 2023 hydrogeological conditions are strongly influenced by acid mine drainage amd generated during mining tomiyama et al 2019 ren et al 2021 changes in acid alkali conditions increases in dissolved metal concentrations and the formation of metal hydroxide precipitates are the main ways that amd affects the aqueous environment tostevin et al 2016 in addition to its acidic nature amd can contain potentially toxic elements ptes such as cadmium cd lead pb zinc zn and arsenic as which cause serious environmental problems around many active closed and abandoned mines kefeni et al 2017 luo et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 kavehei et al 2021 liu et al 2021a after realizing that amd may affect the water quality and chemical composition of domestic water for local or downstream residents and remediation treatments have been implemented at the source of amd generation to minimize the environmental harm martínez et al 2019 the use of basic materials such as limestone lime or caustic soda to increase the ph and precipitate heavy metals is a standard neutralization treatment method kalin et al 2006 cravotta and ward 2008 long term neutralization treatment can also impact the surrounding water and soil environments by increasing the total dissolved solids tdss in water and causing supersaturation of certain minerals in groundwater merkel and planer friedrich 2008 fan et al 2023 the study of the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in pyrite mining areas is complex and it is necessary to comprehensively consider the impacts of human activities including mining and water treatment activities white sedimentary layers of lime precipitation and yellow orange amd were observed in the datai reservoir at the edge of the yunfu pyrite mine in guangdong province china liu et al 2023 the groundwater hydrochemical evolution in the datai reservoir area is representative as the groundwater in this study area is influenced by processes

deng et al 2021 when the dgt device is placed in an aqueous system the target analyte is retained in the gel fixed binding agent by diffusion throughout the gel since the target analyte arrives at the resin only via diffusion the relationship between the mass of the accumulated target analyte and its concentration in the aqueous system can be obtained according to fick s first law the use of dgt devices in wells for groundwater monitoring remains limited santos et al 2022 evaluating the applicability of dgt technology in groundwater quality monitoring contributes to application verification the present study aimed i to investigate the hydrogeochemical characteristics of shallow groundwater in the yunfu pyrite mining area ii to assess the spatial distribution of ptes in groundwater in the

the groundwater in well 1 was dominated by high ionic concentrations of so4 2 and dissolved metal cations such as fe mn and zn resulting in an average ph of 3 2 and an average tds concentration of 4057 3 mg l this corresponds well with the typical characteristics of groundwater in the vicinity of metal sulfide deposits the groundwater in well 2 was ca so4 type water with an average ph of 12 2 and an average tds concentration of 3860 3 mg l with almost no soluble metal content compared to the water in well 1 anthropogenic factors significantly influenced the groundwater in well 2 primarily because the treated water stemming from the amd disposal site with an alkaline reduced state controls the groundwater chemical characteristics of well 2 well 3 is located in the central part of the datai reservoir and contains groundwater of the ca hco3 so4 type wells 4 and 5 are located on the two sides of the stream flowing into the southwest of the datai reservoir and both contained groundwater of the ca hco3 type the surface water samples obtained from the datai reservoir were of the ca so4 type with the ph ranging from 2 89 to 3 25 and an average tds concentration of 1215 mg l in addition to the major aqueous ions these samples had the highest concentrations of mn and fe ions the surface water samples collected from the stream exhibited an average ph of 6 08 and an average tds concentration of 17 5 mg l when compared to the water samples from the datai reservoir the stream water had a ph closer to neutral and a lower tds concentration indicating that the stream water quality was better 4 2 major factors influencing the groundwater geochemistry there are several factors that may cause changes in the hydrogeochemical composition of the groundwater chemistry the gibbs diagram which offers a macroscopic view of the main determinants of the groundwater chemistry marandi and shand 2018 was first presented by gibbs gibbs 1970 the evolution of hydrogeochemistry by natural factors can be classified into three basic mechanisms according to the gibbs diagram rock dominated evaporation dominated and precipitation dominated mechanisms li et al 2016b as the impact of human activities increases traditional gibbs diagrams experience some limitations in the analysis of groundwater formation mechanisms because they cannot identify anthropogenic impacts on groundwater formation li et al 2016a as shown in fig 3 the samples were plotted in different diagram parts revealing that the mechanisms governing the chemical composition of the shallow groundwater surrounding the datai reservoir significantly varied the chemical composition of the groundwater close to the amd pond side was controlled by evaporation processes in the natural genesis mechanism in addition to anthropogenic disturbances the main mechanisms controlling the groundwater chemistry on the stream side and at the center of the datai reservoir included rock dominated and precipitation dominated mechanisms 4 2 1 evaporation processes of groundwater the stable isotopic relationship of δ18o and δd has long been used to identify the source of recharge to aquifer systems wang et al 2013 jasechko 2019 specifically examining the relationship between local groundwater and local meteoric water lines lmwls can often help identify groundwater recharged by surface water with δ18o δd paired values indicative of evaporation in this study precipitation δ18o and δd values for dinghushan 60 km northeast of the yunfu pyrite mine were used to calculate the lmwl gao 2017 the lmwl can be obtained as follows 4 δ d 7 875 δ 18 o 9 412 r 2 0 975 the slope of the lmwl in this region is slightly lower than that of the global meteoric water line gmwl fig 4 shows the relationship between δ18o and δd for both groundwater and surface water the stable isotope values of the analyzed groundwater wells 1 5 ranged from 7 43 to 3 62 for δ18o and 52 27 to 29 01 for δd which define a line with a regression equation of δd 5 034δ18o 9 367 r2 0 878 based on the analysis of the gibbs diagrams the groundwater was divided into two categories to further analyze the hydrogen oxygen isotope relationship the slope of the groundwater evaporation line of wells 1 2 is 5 608 while the slope of the groundwater evaporation line of wells 3 5 is 5 015 both of which are lower than the slope of the lmwl indicating that groundwater evaporation exists in the study area and the evaporation of groundwater in wells 3 5 is more intense the slope of the surface water evaporation line is 4 166 and the d excess value is 14 239 the slopes of the various water evaporation lines exhibit the following order surface water groundwater rainfall the slope of the surface water evaporation line is lower than that of the groundwater line indicating that the effect of surface water evaporation is more intense than that of groundwater evaporation liu et al 2023 4 2 2 water rock interactions in the groundwater system the hydrochemical processes of solute formation in groundwater include ion exchange and chemical reactions the relationship between the dissolved species in groundwater and their composition can reveal the origin of solutes composition diagrams were generated and correlation analyses were conducted fig 5 the dissolution of halite is an important source of na and cl releasing equal amounts of na and cl into groundwater marghade et al 2012 fig 5a shows that the ratio of na cl is 1 probably due to the increase in the na content in groundwater caused by silicate hydrolysis meybeck 1987 li et al 2016a nematollahi et al 2016 xing et al 2022 cation exchange between ca and na is also a hydrogeochemical process that controls changes in the concentration of na ions in groundwater li et al 2018 li et al 2020a 5 2 n a a l si 3 o 8 2 c o 2 11 h 2 o al 2 si 2 o 5 o h 4 4 h 4 s i o 4 2 na 2 h c o 3 the scatter diagram of na versus so4 2 fig 5b shows a corresponding increase in so4 2 in well 3 indicating the presence of a potential source of sulfate dissolution in general gypsum dissolution contributes to the formation of both ca2 and so4 2 ions in water li et al 2016b if gypsum dissolution is the source of ca2 and so4 2 they should be plotted along the 1 1 line in the scatter plot the points of the samples obtained from well 2 were plotted above the l 1 line of the ca2 and so4 2 diagram fig 5c with ca2 exceeding so4 2 indicating the presence of other ca2 sources in the groundwater in well 2 the specific investigation of this study area revealed that ca in the groundwater at the local scale was of artificial origin in the lime neutralization amd process 6 c a s o 4 2 h 2 o ca 2 s o 4 2 2 h 2 o positive correlations between ca2 and hco3 in the stream catchment area suggest that weathering of calcite caco3 contributes ca2 ions to the shallow groundwater fig 5d and e show no significant differences indicating that the dissolution of dolomite does not contribute to the groundwater chemistry the plot of ca2 versus hco3 shows that the sample points of well 3 occurred above the 1 1 line this suggests that the excess of alkaline earth elements ca2 over hco3 was balanced by so4 2 7 c a c o 3 co 2 h 2 o ca 2 2 h c o 3 ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 scatter diagram fig 5f construction was also performed to identify groundwater mineralization processes the weathering of carbonate and sulfate minerals is the cause of the ratio reaching 1 the reverse ion exchange processes in the analyzed groundwater affected the data well 2 above the 1 1 line the hydrogeochemical program phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 was used to perform groundwater mineral balance calculations to predict the presence of reactive minerals in the system and estimate the reactivity of minerals in this groundwater system fig 6 a clearly shows that the sigypsum value of the groundwater in well 1 2 was 0 indicating that gypsum was saturated based on the si values it was determined that the groundwater in well 2 was supersaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite indicating the presence of precipitation fig 6b illustrates that the samples from well 3 were nearly saturated with respect to carbonate minerals all of the groundwater samples investigated were unsaturated with respect to halite 4 2 3 mining activities impacting the groundwater quality principal component analysis pca was applied to six heavy metals four anions three cations and three basic water quality parameters ph eh and tds concentration table a3 three pcs with eigenvalues of 0 7 and accounting for 99 49 of the total variance were extracted from the analysis the eigenvalues of pcs 1 2 and 3 were 9 56 5 63 and 0 72 respectively accounting for 59 76 35 23 and 4 50 respectively of the total variance in the data set pc 1 with high heavy metal cd fe mn pb tl and zn and sulfate loadings may be related to sulfide containing minerals pc 2 is related to the concentration of ions ca2 na cl and no3 in groundwater as well as to the tds and ph pc 3 is related to the concentration of the ion hco3 fig 7 based on the hydrogeochemical characteristics of the study area the groundwater can be divided into four types the first type well 1 the highest metal concentrations and the lowest ph values corresponds to groundwater with high amd contamination the second type well 2 lower metal concentrations and higher ph values corresponds to groundwater locally affected by amd treatment the third type wells 3 and 4 is groundwater in the central zone of the reservoir possibly affected by amd and the fourth type well 5 is groundwater in the direction of the stream catchment analysis of the heavy metals in the first type of groundwater showed that the concentrations of certain metals fe mn pb and cd exceeded the parametric values ec 1998 who 2022 fig 8 tl reached a level of 20 μg l and is regarded as a high priority pollutant by the us environmental protection agency usepa 2009 and the european water framework directive ec 2000 the levels of all the detected metal ions including mn pb cd zn and tl were below the parameter values except for fe which still exceeded the parameter value in the second groundwater type the mn and pb contents in the third type of groundwater showed different degrees of elevation and exceeded the parameter values although the type iv groundwater indicated a weakly acidic average ph of 5 1 table a2 all of its metal contents were below the parameter values and its tds value was the lowest of the four groundwater types application of in situ dgt monitoring of groundwater the fe mn zn pb and cd concentrations in groundwater wells 1 3 were determined via grab and dgt sampling dgt samples were collected for 24 h the ph and ionic strength of the deployment solution affect the various heavy metal species diffusion behavior and strength of the interaction with the binding agent mass uptake which influences the effectiveness of the dgt technique the dgt findings for well 1 are not presented here since the ph of the groundwater in well 1 is too low 3 2 and the tds concentration 4057 3 mg l is too high for the chelex dgt devices the concentrations of the 5 metals were above the detection limits of the instruments used for analysis 0 05 μg l for icp ms and 0 2 μg l for chelex dgt as shown in fig 9 and table a4 the values of cdgt cgrab r of the metals fe mn zn pb and cd in wells 2 and 3 ranged from 1 10 to 0 12 regarding the metals other than mn and cd cgrab was higher than cdgt the cdgt value of mn suitably agreed with that of cgrab under alkaline conditions at a ph of 12 2 under these environmental conditions cdgt also performed well for cd detection with an r value equal to 0 8 relative to cgrab the comparative results of well 3 showed that the detection of cd by the dgt technique was particularly effective under neutral conditions at a ph of 7 with an r value of 1 comparison of the ionic concentrations of mn and fe revealed that when the measured metal content was very high the dgt detection results significantly differed from those of grab sampling which is directly related to the adsorption amount of the adsorbent gel the cdgt values of zn and pb in the well 3 groundwater were approximately half those of the grab sample the size solubility and mobility of a given metal determine whether it can be effectively adsorbed by the binding gel of dgt devices deng et al 2021 in addition the application of dgt technology in groundwater requires consideration of the seepage rate of groundwater in boreholes relatively static conditions may lead to an increase in the dbl thickness which may affect the accuracy of dgt detection lucas et al 2014 alakangas et al 2020 it has been demonstrated that the cdgt concentration obtained with various diffusion gel thicknesses does not differ much for cd santos et al 2022 the dbl thickness used in this study was 0 15 mm lucas et al 2014 and the results demonstrated that the dgt approach is useful for the monitoring of low mn and cd concentrations in neutral or alkaline groundwater systems 5 conclusions the spatial temporal patterns of the groundwater hydrogeochemistry around pyrite mining areas are constrained by geological conditions and anthropogenic activities in particular the release of ptes into groundwater poses a threat to the drinking water safety of the surrounding residents in addition to traditional hydrogeochemical analysis methods the monitoring of ptes in groundwater has higher demands in this study hydrogeochemical methods hydrogen and oxygen isotope measurements and principal component analysis was used to determine the hydrochemical characteristics and evolutionary mechanisms of groundwater around a pyrite mining area under the influence of amd and artificial remediation treatments furthermore the applicability of the in situ dgt technique for the determination of ptes in groundwater was evaluated via a comparison to conventional grab sampling the conclusions are as follows via pca the groundwater samples were classified into four types brackish water dominated by sulfate ions tds 3000 mg l brackish water dominated by ca hco3 tds 3000 mg l fresh water with the presence of ptes and fresh water with low mineralization the gibbs diagrams identified the main controls on the hydrogeochemistry namely evaporative precipitation and water rock interactions the saturation index values suggested that the dissolution of calcite as well as human activities are responsible for the groundwater chemistry the dgt sampling technique is suitable for the detection of low concentrations of mn and cd in neutral or slightly alkaline groundwater systems the impact of mining activities on the ecological environment including groundwater is gaining increasing attention in addition to the environmental pollution caused by mining activities artificial remediation treatments at the surface can affect groundwater systems there is a need to strengthen the continuous monitoring of the groundwater quality including the content of ptes credit authorship contribution statement yu liu investigation data

1818,acid mine drainage amd resulting from pyrite mining causes hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater and in particular the consequent release of potentially toxic elements ptes posing health risks to populations dependent on groundwater in this study hydrogeochemical characteristics and evolutionary mechanisms were systematically illustrated via multivariate statistical methods and hydrogeochemical methods based on groundwater samples n 40 collected in a pyrite mining area in southern china the diffusive gradients in thin films dgt technique was applied to evaluate the accuracy of metal content detection in groundwater at low concentrations based on principal component analysis pca the groundwater dataset was classified into four types brackish water dominated by sulfate brackish water dominated by ca hco3 low mineralized water with the presence of ptes and freshwater in its natural state the main controlling factors of hydrogeochemistry are evaporative crystallization and water rock interactions fe mn pb and cd were detected in groundwater in the study area at levels exceeding world health organization who parameter values and the highly toxic trace metal tl was detected at levels up to 20 μg l the assessment of the applicability of the dgt technique to groundwater systems showed that reliable dgt detection results could be obtained under neutral or alkaline conditions at low mn and cd levels this study highlights the evolution of the groundwater hydrogeochemistry under the combined influences of human activities such as mining and remediation management in particular the release of ptes can affect human health while the adoption of in situ dgt technology can provide strong support for studying these issues keywords groundwater acid mine drainage potentially toxic elements diffusive gradients in thin films technique data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in pyrite mining areas is based on dominant natural processes including water rock interactions weathering evaporation mineral dissolution and ion exchange reactions sunkari et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 wang et al 2023 yuan et al 2023 hydrogeological conditions are strongly influenced by acid mine drainage amd generated during mining tomiyama et al 2019 ren et al 2021 changes in acid alkali conditions increases in dissolved metal concentrations and the formation of metal hydroxide precipitates are the main ways that amd affects the aqueous environment tostevin et al 2016 in addition to its acidic nature amd can contain potentially toxic elements ptes such as cadmium cd lead pb zinc zn and arsenic as which cause serious environmental problems around many active closed and abandoned mines kefeni et al 2017 luo et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 kavehei et al 2021 liu et al 2021a after realizing that amd may affect the water quality and chemical composition of domestic water for local or downstream residents and remediation treatments have been implemented at the source of amd generation to minimize the environmental harm martínez et al 2019 the use of basic materials such as limestone lime or caustic soda to increase the ph and precipitate heavy metals is a standard neutralization treatment method kalin et al 2006 cravotta and ward 2008 long term neutralization treatment can also impact the surrounding water and soil environments by increasing the total dissolved solids tdss in water and causing supersaturation of certain minerals in groundwater merkel and planer friedrich 2008 fan et al 2023 the study of the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in pyrite mining areas is complex and it is necessary to comprehensively consider the impacts of human activities including mining and water treatment activities white sedimentary layers of lime precipitation and yellow orange amd were observed in the datai reservoir at the edge of the yunfu pyrite mine in guangdong province china liu et al 2023 the groundwater hydrochemical evolution in the datai reservoir area is representative as the groundwater in this study area is influenced by processes including natural formation typical mining activities and artificial water treatment in addition to traditional sampling methods and analytical detection techniques for the characterization of the groundwater hydrochemistry in the yunfu pyrite mining area a new approach for groundwater quality monitoring namely the diffusive gradients in thin films dgt technique was used to assess the pte concentrations in situ the dgt technique was developed davison and zhang 1994 zhang and davison 1995 to measure labile metal species in natural water zhou et al 2016 li et al 2020b byrne et al 2021 deng et al 2021 when the dgt device is placed in an aqueous system the target analyte is retained in the gel fixed binding agent by diffusion throughout the gel since the target analyte arrives at the resin only via diffusion the relationship between the mass of the accumulated target analyte and its concentration in the aqueous system can be obtained according to fick s first law the use of dgt devices in wells for groundwater monitoring remains limited santos et al 2022 evaluating the applicability of dgt technology in groundwater quality monitoring contributes to application verification the present study aimed i to investigate the hydrogeochemical characteristics of shallow groundwater in the yunfu pyrite mining area ii to assess the spatial distribution of ptes in groundwater in the study area and iii to evaluate the applicability of dgt technology in groundwater quality monitoring the findings will be beneficial to understanding the effects of mining and anthropogenic remediation on groundwater system evolution particularly the distribution and transport of ptes this work will provide a scientific basis for residents to use groundwater safely 2 materials and

1988 a number of environmental protection projects including the datai reservoir were completed deng and chen 1989 x ray diffraction analysis of the common tailings of the yunfu pyrite mine revealed that the tailings mainly quartz anorthite gypsum pyrite and mica group minerals chen et al 2016 the tailings major chemical composition is sio2 fe2o3 al2o3 cao and so3 with the so3 level ranging from 15 89 to 18 27 yin et al 2022 the heavy metal content in the common tailings of the yunfu pyrite mine was 2901 mg kg mn 168 3 mg kg pb and 672 mg kg zn chen et al 2016 the tailings stockpiled in the

less rainfall occurs in winter su et al 2014 2 2 water sampling drilling of five groundwater monitoring wells numbered 1 5 was conducted in july 2019 in the study area as shown in fig 1 well 1 is located next to the amd pond and was drilled to a depth of 16 2 m with a groundwater depth ranging from 2 to 3 68 m in contrast to well 1 well 2 exhibits a wastewater disposal site on its east side and both wells are close to the amd pond water treated with lime is regularly pumped from here into the datai reservoir well 2 was drilled to a depth of 14 8 m and the groundwater level depth ranges from 4 45 to 5 14 m well 3 was drilled to a depth of 18 2 m with a groundwater level depth ranging from 1 to 1 5 m close to the middle of the datai reservoir wells 4 and 5 are located on either side of the surface runoff that flows into the datai reservoir with depths of 16 1 and 18 4 m respectively and groundwater level depths averaging 1 2 and 7 m respectively sample collection included monthly groundwater samples from july to december 2019 groundwater samples in october 2021 and surface water samples during this sampling period the total number of water samples was 40 including 35 groundwater samples and 5 surface water samples following the collection of water samples basic water quality parameters such as the temperature t conductivity con ph total dissolved solids tdss and dissolved oxygen do were immediately measured using a portable water quality parameter detector j sz100 the water samples for major cation and metal element measurements were filtered through 0 45 µm filters on site and loaded into high density polyethylene hdpe bottles the water samples were stored in a cooler at 4 c and tested over a period of one week the cations in the water samples were determined via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms nexion 300 at the als minerals laboratory guangzhou china anions including so4 2 cl and no3 were determined via ion chromatography metrohm 925 at guangzhou university the hco3 concentration was measured through titration the stable isotope compositions of oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δd in the groundwater samples were measured via elemental analyzer isotope ratio mass spectrometry ea irms at the laboratory of northwest a f university china the analytical data for each sample were assessed for accuracy by the charge balance

in total 12 dgt samplers were collected 3 methods the hydrogeochemical characteristics of water were investigated using the piper geochemical plot piper 1944 geochemical plots were constructed in aquachem scientific software multivariate statistical methods such as principal component analysis pca were used to establish relationships between the ions and to classify the groundwater at the different locations pca was performed with origin 2021 software geochemical modeling program phreeqc version 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 with database wateq4f was employed to calculate the saturation index si values of 35 groundwater samples the si reflects the tendency of a mineral phase to dissolve or precipitate in water if si 0 the aqueous solution is not saturated with respect to the mineral and the mineral continues to dissolve in the water if si 0 the aqueous solution is saturated with respect to the mineral it is generally accepted that aqueous solutions and minerals reach equilibrium when the si value varies between 0 5 and 0 5 the dgt technique is based on fick s first law of diffusion the principle is that the target ions pass through the diffusive gel layer per unit time and they are subsequently immobilized by the adsorption gel and finally eluted to obtain separated concentrations of the target ions zhang and davison 1995 cdgt can be estimated using eqs 2 and 3 xu et al

of the measured substances in the gel the measured substance m ng passes through the diffusive area a cm2 during the deployment time t s the quantity of m can be calculated using eq 3 where ce μgl 1 is the concentration of the analyte in the eluate vgel and ve ml are the volumes of the binding gel and eluent respectively and fe is the elution efficiency of the measured substance 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogeochemical compositions of groundwater and surface water the hydrochemical parameters of the water samples collected in the wells datai reservoir and streams near the amd pond north of the yunfu pyrite tailings pile are summarized in table a1 and their corresponding hydrochemical properties are shown in a piper diagram fig 2 the statistical analysis results for the groundwater samples from wells 1 5 are provided in table a2 the ph eh and tds values of the groundwater samples in the study area ranged from 3 2 to 12 2 31 3 396 1 and 13 1 4057 3 mg l respectively the groundwater in well 1 was dominated by high ionic concentrations of so4 2 and dissolved metal cations such as fe mn and zn resulting in an average ph of 3 2 and an average tds concentration of 4057 3 mg l this corresponds well with the typical characteristics of groundwater in the vicinity of metal sulfide deposits the groundwater in well 2 was ca so4 type water with an average ph of 12 2 and an average tds concentration of 3860 3 mg l with almost no soluble metal content compared to the water in well 1 anthropogenic factors significantly influenced the groundwater in well 2 primarily because the treated water stemming from the amd disposal site with an alkaline reduced state controls the groundwater chemical characteristics of well 2 well 3 is located in the central part of the datai reservoir and contains groundwater of the ca hco3 so4 type wells 4 and 5 are located on the two sides of the stream flowing into the southwest of the datai reservoir and both contained groundwater of the ca hco3 type the surface water samples obtained from the datai reservoir were of the ca so4 type with the ph ranging from 2 89 to 3 25 and an average tds concentration of 1215 mg l in addition to the major aqueous ions these samples had the highest concentrations of mn and fe ions the surface water samples collected from the stream exhibited an average ph of 6 08 and an average tds concentration of 17 5 mg l when compared to the water samples from the datai reservoir the stream water had a ph closer to neutral and a lower tds concentration indicating that the stream water quality was better 4 2 major factors influencing the groundwater geochemistry there are several factors that may cause changes in the hydrogeochemical composition of the groundwater chemistry the gibbs diagram which offers a macroscopic view of the main determinants of the groundwater chemistry marandi and shand 2018 was first presented by gibbs gibbs 1970 the evolution of hydrogeochemistry by natural factors can be classified into three basic mechanisms according to the gibbs diagram rock dominated evaporation dominated and precipitation dominated mechanisms li et al 2016b as the impact of human activities increases traditional gibbs diagrams experience some limitations in the analysis of groundwater formation mechanisms because they cannot identify anthropogenic impacts on groundwater formation li et al 2016a as shown in fig 3 the samples were plotted in different diagram parts revealing that the mechanisms governing the chemical composition of the shallow groundwater surrounding the datai reservoir significantly varied the chemical composition of the groundwater close to the amd pond side was controlled by evaporation processes in the natural genesis mechanism in addition to anthropogenic disturbances the main mechanisms controlling the groundwater chemistry on the stream side and at the center of the datai reservoir included rock dominated and precipitation dominated mechanisms 4 2 1 evaporation processes of groundwater the stable isotopic relationship of δ18o and δd has long been used to identify the source of recharge to aquifer systems wang et al 2013 jasechko 2019 specifically examining the relationship between local groundwater and local meteoric water lines lmwls can often help identify groundwater recharged by surface water with δ18o δd paired values indicative of evaporation in this study precipitation δ18o and δd values for dinghushan 60 km northeast of the yunfu pyrite mine were used to calculate the lmwl gao 2017 the lmwl can be obtained as follows 4 δ d 7 875 δ 18 o 9 412 r 2 0 975 the slope of the lmwl in this region is slightly lower than that of the global meteoric water line gmwl fig 4 shows the relationship between δ18o and δd for both groundwater and surface water the stable isotope values of the analyzed groundwater wells 1 5 ranged from 7 43 to 3 62 for δ18o and 52 27 to 29 01 for δd which define a line with a regression equation of δd 5 034δ18o 9 367 r2 0 878 based on the analysis of the gibbs diagrams the groundwater was divided into two categories to further analyze the hydrogen oxygen isotope relationship the slope of the groundwater evaporation line of wells 1 2 is 5 608 while the slope of the groundwater evaporation line of wells 3 5 is 5 015 both of which are lower than the slope of the lmwl indicating that groundwater evaporation exists in the study area and the evaporation of groundwater in wells 3 5 is more intense the slope of the surface water evaporation line is 4 166 and the d excess value is 14 239 the slopes of the various water evaporation lines exhibit the following order surface water groundwater rainfall the slope of the surface water evaporation line is lower than that of the groundwater line indicating that the effect of surface water evaporation is more intense than that of groundwater evaporation liu et al 2023 4 2 2 water rock interactions in the groundwater system the hydrochemical processes of solute formation in groundwater include ion exchange and chemical reactions the relationship between the dissolved species in groundwater and their composition can reveal the origin of solutes composition diagrams were generated and correlation analyses were conducted fig 5 the dissolution of halite is an important source of na and cl releasing equal amounts of na and cl into groundwater marghade et al 2012 fig 5a shows that the ratio of na cl is 1 probably due to the increase in the na content in groundwater caused by silicate hydrolysis meybeck 1987 li et al 2016a nematollahi et al 2016 xing et al 2022 cation exchange between ca and na is also a hydrogeochemical process that controls changes in the concentration of na ions in groundwater li et al 2018 li

groundwater in well 2 was supersaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite indicating the presence of precipitation fig 6b illustrates that the samples from well 3 were nearly saturated with

pca was applied to six heavy metals four anions three cations and three basic water quality parameters ph eh and tds concentration table a3 three pcs with eigenvalues of 0 7 and accounting for 99 49 of the total variance were extracted from the analysis the eigenvalues of pcs 1 2 and 3 were 9 56 5 63 and 0 72 respectively accounting for 59 76 35 23 and 4 50 respectively of the total variance in the data set pc 1 with high heavy metal cd fe mn pb tl and zn and sulfate loadings may be related to sulfide containing minerals pc 2 is related to the concentration of ions ca2 na cl and no3 in groundwater as well as to the tds and ph pc 3 is related to the concentration of the ion hco3 fig 7 based on the hydrogeochemical characteristics of the study area the groundwater can be divided into four types the first type well 1 the highest metal concentrations and the lowest ph values corresponds to groundwater with high amd contamination the second type well 2 lower metal concentrations and higher ph values corresponds to groundwater locally affected by amd treatment the third type wells 3 and 4 is groundwater in the central zone of the reservoir possibly affected by amd and the fourth type well 5 is groundwater in the direction of the stream catchment analysis of the heavy metals in the first type of groundwater showed that the concentrations of certain metals fe mn pb and cd exceeded the parametric values ec 1998 who 2022 fig 8 tl reached a level of 20 μg l and is regarded as a high priority pollutant by the us environmental protection agency usepa 2009 and the european water framework directive ec 2000 the levels of all the detected metal ions including mn pb cd zn and tl were below the parameter values except for fe which still exceeded the parameter value in the second groundwater type the mn and pb contents in the third type of groundwater showed different degrees of elevation and exceeded the parameter values although the type iv groundwater indicated a weakly acidic average ph of 5 1 table a2 all of its metal contents were below the parameter values and its tds value was the lowest of the four groundwater types application of in situ dgt monitoring of groundwater the fe mn zn pb and cd concentrations in groundwater wells 1 3 were determined via grab and dgt sampling dgt samples were collected for 24 h the ph and ionic strength of the deployment solution affect the various heavy metal species diffusion behavior and strength of the interaction with the binding agent mass uptake which influences the effectiveness of the dgt technique the dgt findings for well 1 are not presented here since the ph of the groundwater in well 1 is too low 3 2 and the tds concentration 4057 3 mg l is too high for the chelex dgt devices the concentrations of the 5 metals were above the detection limits of the instruments used for analysis 0 05 μg l for icp ms and 0 2 μg l for chelex dgt as shown in fig 9 and table a4 the values of cdgt cgrab r of the metals fe mn zn pb and cd in wells 2 and 3 ranged from 1 10 to 0 12 regarding the metals other than mn and cd cgrab was higher than cdgt the cdgt value of mn suitably agreed with that of cgrab under alkaline conditions at a ph of 12 2 under these environmental conditions cdgt also performed well for cd detection with an r value equal to 0 8 relative to cgrab the comparative results of well 3 showed that the detection of cd by the dgt technique was particularly effective under neutral conditions at a ph of 7 with an r value of 1 comparison of the ionic concentrations of mn and fe revealed that when the measured metal content was very high the dgt detection results significantly differed from those of grab sampling which is directly related to the adsorption amount of the adsorbent gel the cdgt values of zn and pb in the well 3 groundwater were approximately half those of the grab sample the size solubility and mobility of a given metal determine whether it can be effectively adsorbed by the binding gel of dgt devices deng et al 2021 in addition the application of dgt technology in groundwater requires consideration of the seepage rate of groundwater in boreholes relatively static conditions may lead to an increase in the dbl thickness which may affect the accuracy of dgt detection lucas et al 2014 alakangas et al 2020 it has been demonstrated that the cdgt concentration obtained with various diffusion gel thicknesses does not differ much for cd santos et al 2022 the dbl thickness used in this study was 0 15 mm lucas et al 2014 and the results demonstrated that the dgt approach is useful for the monitoring of low mn and cd concentrations in neutral or alkaline groundwater systems 5 conclusions the spatial temporal patterns of the groundwater hydrogeochemistry around pyrite mining areas are constrained by geological conditions and anthropogenic activities in particular the release of ptes into groundwater poses a threat to the drinking water safety of the surrounding residents in addition to traditional hydrogeochemical analysis methods the monitoring of ptes in groundwater has higher demands in this study hydrogeochemical methods hydrogen and oxygen isotope measurements and principal component analysis was used to determine the hydrochemical characteristics and evolutionary mechanisms of groundwater around a pyrite mining area under the influence of amd and artificial remediation treatments furthermore the applicability of the in situ dgt technique for the determination of ptes in groundwater was evaluated via a comparison to conventional grab sampling the conclusions are as follows via pca the groundwater samples were classified into four types brackish water dominated by sulfate ions tds 3000 mg l brackish water dominated by ca hco3 tds 3000 mg l fresh water with the presence of ptes and fresh water with low mineralization the gibbs diagrams identified the main controls on the hydrogeochemistry namely evaporative precipitation and water rock interactions the saturation index values suggested that the dissolution of calcite as well as human activities are responsible for the groundwater chemistry the dgt sampling technique is suitable for the detection of low concentrations of mn and cd in neutral or slightly alkaline groundwater systems the impact of mining activities on the ecological environment including groundwater is gaining increasing attention in addition to the environmental pollution caused by mining activities artificial remediation treatments at the surface can affect groundwater systems there is a need to strengthen the continuous monitoring of the groundwater quality including the content of ptes credit authorship contribution statement yu liu investigation data

1819,to reveal the mechanism of the water gas two phase repulsion during water infiltration and its barometric pressure change and resistivity response in the vadose zone while it provides the basic theory for water resources evaluation and groundwater pollution also provides technical support for the accurate interpretation of electrical resistivity tomography ert application therefore a research system based on laboratory experiments numerical simulations and ert was established to determine the moisture transport pattern and the quantitative relationships between barometric pressure and resistivity the results show that the intensity of the water infiltration process in the vadose zone meets the percolation theory the barometric pressure will go through three stages when the infiltration intensity is higher than the critical value the critical time of the barometric pressure variation shortens gradually with the infiltration intensity and medium permeability increase in contrast the maximum barometric pressure increases gradually with the rise in infiltration intensity and medium porosity the layered heterogeneous structure s effect depends on the underlying medium s properties the trivial variation of resistivity responds to the barometric pressure variation the quantitative relationship between the resistivity and the barometric pressure in the vadose zone is established by the difference between the measured value and the calculated value by improving archie s formula the resistivity reduction due to increasing barometric pressure can account for over 10 9 of the moisture effect these insights provide technical support for ert applications to eliminate barometric pressure s effect on resistivity and accurately identify the target medium keywords barometric pressure resistivity ert water infiltration vadose zone data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the vadose zone is a conduit for water exchange in the earth s shallow rims groundwater receives recharge from infiltration of atmospheric precipitation and surface water through the vadose zone and discharges through evaporation in the vadose zone therefore water transport in the vadose zone is vital to the hydrological cycle stephens et al 2018 arora and ahmed 2011 water transport in the vadose zone has become a hot topic in many disciplines investigating water transport in the vadose zone is of great practical significance for studying water resource evaluation groundwater pollution agricultural irrigation and other issues jiang et al 2021 singh et al 2018 the water transport in the vadose zone is a process of water gas two phase displacement which usually causes changes in the barometric pressure however the effect of barometric pressure variation is often ignored in traditional studies of water transport in the vadose zone i e it is assumed that the gas expulsion process is always unrestricted only a few researchers have paid attention to the influence of the gas phase and have done some studies on the water gas interaction during water infiltration in the vadose zone hardie et al 2012 sun et al 2008 peng et al 2002 weeks 2002 culligan et al 2000 among them wang et al 1997 found that the infiltration rate of moisture is lower under closed air conditions than under exhaust conditions in the soil column infiltration experiments in the process of the gas being compressed the barometric pressure rises continuously to a certain extent the air will break through the overlying water bearing layer to escape from the gas channels out of the system at that time the barometric pressure will rapidly decrease and when it decreases to a certain extent the previously formed gas channels are re occupied by moisture wei et al 2020 kong et al 2009 wang et al 1998 linden and dixon 1976 found through site infiltration experiments that a rise in barometric pressure in the soil from 0 kpa to 0 5 kpa was sufficient to cause an order of magnitude decrease in infiltration flow rate wei et al 2020 proposed an equation to predict the critical water infiltration intensity for a porous medium which is established by the permeability and pore size distribution of the porous medium it was found that critical water infiltration intensity increases with the permeability of the porous medium and increases as the pore size becomes more uniform in addition the change of barometric pressure due to the water infiltration impacts the resistivity of the vadose zone however previous studies have mainly focused on the effect of medium pore structure changes triggered by high pressure conditions on resistivity in large scale field or laboratory experiments while there is a lack of research on the impact of barometric pressure variation on resistivity during water infiltration henine et al 2021 brace and orange 1968 brace et al 1965 for example chen 2019 carried out a physical simulation study of an air rich soil layer and the results showed that the resistivity of the soil increased with inflation the causation is that with the increase of inflation the barometric pressure keeps rising which makes the moisture in the soil extrude and the resistivity larger li 2010a li 2010b conducted a field observation study of soil electrical conductivity characteristics and barometric pressure the results show that there is a phase positive or negative correlation characteristic between soil resistivity and monthly average barometric pressure and the change of resistivity is the result of the joint influence of barometric pressure and other meteorological factors yamasaki and arai 2008 conducted pressurization experiments on core samples using air and found that the resistivity changed by 5 to 25 under different barometric pressure conditions the causation is that when the barometric pressure increases to a certain degree the pore structure of the medium changes and the original large pores in the medium become tiny pores or even micro pores so that the medium particles become denser and resistivity becomes smaller zhou et al 2011 in the water infiltration process in the vadose zone the barometric pressure affects the transport of the wetting front which in turn affects the spatial distribution of moisture content and leads to the change of resistivity in addition the changes in medium structure and free charges induced by the barometric pressure variation can directly lead to changes in resistivity however the mechanisms involved need to be further investigated therefore there is an urgent need to conduct experimental research on the relationship between barometric pressure and resistivity under variable controllable conditions in water infiltration in the vadose zone the traditional research methods of water transport in the vadose zone include laboratory experiments and numerical simulations laboratory experiments provide a necessary and effective means to study the pattern of water gas two phase displacement in the water infiltration process in the vadose zone while numerical simulation has become an essential tool for analyzing and solving groundwater problems due to their convenience and efficiency sun et al 2015 niessner et al 2009 navarro et al 2008 weir and kissling 1992 felton and reddell 1992 in addition geophysical methods such as electrical resistivity tomography ert are also commonly used ert is based on the difference in electrical properties between the target body and the environmental medium and uses electrodes placed on the surface to obtain the resistivity response characteristics at different depth locations which can identify the deep medium properties therefore ert is widely used in hydrogeological fields such as karst investigation stratigraphic distribution dam leakage detection and water transport processes in the vadose zone because of its many advantages such as in situ non destructive convenient operation and reliable results zhu et al 2020 caterina et al 2017 dietrich et al 2014 power et al 2013 islam et al 2012 garré et al 2012 garré et al 2010 atekwana et al 2000 however for water and solute transport monitoring studies in the vadose zone using ert the target mainly focuses on moisture while the effect of the barometric pressure is always ignored or underestimated qiang et al 2022 kang et al 2021 li 2010a li 2010b touma et al 1984 which results in an overestimation of the moisture transport rate and a misrepresentation of the actual situation of moisture transport and the target body extending to various fields of applied ert the neglect of the barometric pressure within the medium can directly lead to the misrepresentation of the target body therefore it is important to determine the quantitative relationship between barometric pressure and resistivity within a porous medium which is complementary to the accurate inferential identification of the properties and morphology of the target body using ert in the above background to reveal the intrinsic mechanism of the water gas two phase repulsion and the influence of barometric pressure variation on resistivity in the vadose zone during the water infiltration sieve out the errors of resistivity response to barometric pressure changes and realize the scientific application of ert and the accurate interpretation of data the research system combining laboratory experiments and numerical simulations with the ert is established in this paper the main innovative objectives are as follows 1 to reveal the displacement pattern of water gas two phases during the water infiltration in the vadose zone 2 to elucidate the pattern of barometric pressure change and influence mechanism during the water infiltration in the vadose zone 3 to fully reveal the potential influence mechanism and quantitative relationship of barometric pressure change on electrical resistivity in the vadose zone which provides theoretical support for the application of geophysical electrical methods and the accurate interpretation of data 2 materials and methods 2 1 theoretical background water transport in the vadose zone is two phase or even multi phase displacement process and the effect of the gas phase in the vadose zone can be summarized as three types including the viscous effect the hysteresis effect and the compression effect among them the gas s compression effect is that it is compressed due to the restricted release and the increased barometric pressure blocks the water infiltration and reduces the rate of water infiltration the motion of the water and gas phases in the vadose zone follows the law of conservation of mass and energy and darcy s law can be extended to the gas phase when considering the water gas two phase flow 1 v β k k r β μ β p β ρ β g where β represents the fluid phase gas phase or water phase v β represents the permeable flow rate of β phase m s k represents absolute permeability of the medium m2 k r β represents relative permeability of β phase p β represents the pressure of β phase n ρ β represents the density of β phase kg m3 g represents gravitational acceleration m s2 for the transport of water gas two phase in the vadose zone assuming that the pores of the vadose zone are filled with water and gas phases and based on the law of conservation of mass without considering the deformation of the solid skeleton the basic equations for the transport of water and gas phases are as follows 2 n s β ρ β t d i v ρ β v β 0 where n represents porosity s β represents saturation of β phase the meaning of other parameters is the same as in equation 1 substituting equation 1 into equation 2 yields the following equation 3 n

laboratory experiments is made of glass and the internal dimensions are 55 cm 45 cm 2 5 cm length height width the upper boundary of the sandbox simulates the contact boundary between the vadose zone and the atmosphere to receive water infiltration in contrast the left right and bottom boundaries are closed so they are isolated from the external environment during the experiment an intelligent manual device was used to ensure uniform water infiltration at the upper boundary of the sandbox three rows and three columns of nine air holes are distributed on the front of the sandbox and three barometers are installed in the bottom row of air holes 15 cm from the bottom of the sandbox to monitor the change of barometric pressure in the sandbox during the water infiltration see fig 1 a a differential pressure barometer testo 510i was used for this experiment and the measured barometric pressure data were recorded on a mobile terminal via bluetooth the barometer range is 15000 pa 15000 pa the measurement accuracy is 5 pa and the sampling interval is 2 s it should be noted that since the measured values of the three barometers were close less than 10 pa difference in the subsequent experiments the average measured values of the three barometers were taken to represent the barometric pressure in the vadose zone in this paper in addition the electrodes were placed on the surface and bottom of the experimental sandbox to monitor the apparent resistivity of the vadose zone at the upper and lower part of the wetting front respectively to study the response of the apparent resistivity of the vadose zone to water infiltration under the influence of the wetting front the apparent resistivity is referred to as resistivity throughout this paper the duk 2 high density electrophotometer produced by chongqing geological instrument factory was selected see fig 1a before each set of experiments was conducted the medium quartz sand was soaked in dilute nitric acid which was washed with deionized water until ph was neutral and finally dried and filled into the sandbox using the wet method the parameters of the two quartz sands selected in this study are shown in table 1 2 3 numerical experiments in this paper the numerical simulation of water gas two phase flow was performed based on the eos3 module in petrasim a visualization software developed by tough2 the experimental sandbox is generalized to a two dimensional model of water gas two phase flow in the vadose zone under infiltration conditions and the schematic diagram of the sandbox model is shown in fig 1a the dimension of the generalized model is 55 cm 45 cm 2 5 cm x axis z axis y axis and the left γ2 right γ3 and lower γ4 boundaries are generalized to zero flux boundaries the infiltrated water is added to the upper boundary γ1 as a source sink term via a type ii boundary condition for the water phase for the gas phase γ1 is generalized to a fixed atmospheric boundary 1 013e5 pa the grid profile is shown in fig 1b and the grid s horizontal and vertical spacing is 1 cm the first grid layer γ1 is used as the infiltration recharge source and the models are all set to a constant temperature of 25 c the main parameters of the medium are set according to table 1 the numerical simulation scenarios are set according to table 2 and the model parameters are set according to table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 barometric pressure variation during water infiltration in the vadose zone 3 1 1 water infiltration intensity the change in water infiltration intensity will lead to the differential barometric pressure change in the vadose zone during water infiltration there is a critical value of water infiltration intensity when the water infiltration intensity of the vadose zone is less than the critical value the change in barometric pressure is minimal however when the infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value the barometric pressure in the vadose zone shows a trend of three stages and the critical value of water infiltration intensity is different for different medium structures of the vadose zone for example the critical infiltration intensity ranges from 0 72 cm min to 1 25 cm min in the 40 50 mesh homogeneous vadose zone and the critical infiltration intensity ranges from 5 82 cm min to 7 27 cm min in the 20 30 mesh homogeneous vadose zone wei et al 2020 in the vadose zone the change in barometric pressure is small when the water infiltration intensity is less than the critical value the change of barometric pressure under closed air hole conditions is consistent with that under open air hole conditions fig 2 indicating that when the infiltration intensity is less than the critical value the infiltrated water is not enough to occupy most of the pore channels in the vadose zone resulting in the moisture in the upper layer of the vadose zone not being able to form a wrapping effect on the gas in the lower layer therefore no matter whether the air holes are open or closed the gas phase can always be freely released from the top boundary of the sandbox along the pore channels and the barometric pressure of the vadose zone will not change obviously assouline 2013 broadbridge et al 2009 when the water infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value the change of the barometric pressure in the vadose zone under open air hole conditions is close to that of the infiltration intensity is less than the critical value and it always fluctuates in a small range in contrast the barometric pressure in the vadose zone under closed air hole conditions changes significantly and goes through three stages including slow growth sharp increase and stability fig 2 at the early stage of water infiltration more than the infiltrated water is needed to occupy most of the pore channels in the upper layer of the vadose zone as the water moves downward the compressed gas will be released from the pore channels or break through the cohesive force between the water to form gas channels the barometric pressure in the vadose zone increases slowly with the increase of infiltrated water when the water in the vadose zone is enough to occupy most of the pore channels the gas in the vadose zone is wrapped by the upper layer of water it cannot be effectively released so the gas is continuously compressed and the barometric pressure increases rapidly when the dynamic equilibrium is reached between the increased barometric pressure and the pressure of the infiltrated water the lower layer of gas will forcefully break through the upper layer of water to release as the water continues to infiltrate thus maintaining the stability of barometric pressure wei et al 2020 kong et al 2009 wang et al 1998 when the water infiltration intensity exceeds the critical value with the increase of the water infiltration intensity the time of the slow growth stage and the sharp increase stage of the barometric pressure will be shortened the maximum value of the barometric pressure in the stability stage will be slightly increased which means that the rate of barometric pressure variation rises with the increase of the water infiltration intensity in addition tough2 was used to simulate the change of barometric pressure in the vadose zone with the water infiltration intensity the simulation results show that when the infiltration intensity is less than the critical value the simulation results are consistent with the experimental results both show that the barometric pressure in the vadose zone fluctuates in a small range when the infiltration intensity exceeds the critical value the simulated results show the same pattern as the measured results however the difference between the actual medium characteristics and the ideal parameters selected by the model leads to a slight difference between the measured and simulated results 3 1 2 medium properties the medium structure of the vadose zone is another important factor affecting the barometric pressure in the vadose zone during water infiltration the results show that in the homogeneous vadose zone the critical value of water infiltration intensity increases gradually as the particle size of the medium increases the critical value of water infiltration intensity in layered heterogeneous vadose zone mainly depends on the critical value in the low permeability media layer on the moisture transport path wei et al 2020 for the homogeneous vadose zone when the water infiltration intensity is less than the critical value the barometric pressure variation during water infiltration is slight and the barometric pressure variation under the open and closed air hole conditions is consistent with the increase of the medium s particle size the barometric pressure rate in the vadose zone gradually increases when the water infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value for the homogeneous vadose zone 40 50 the barometric pressure is always rising in the first 62 s of the experiment it increases sharply from 46 s to 62 s with an average rise rate of 101 pa s after which the barometric pressure is stabilized around 2000 pa for the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 there was a significant difference in the barometric pressure variation between the open and closed air hole conditions like that of the homogeneous vadose zone 40 50 however the two structure of the vadose zone is different in terms of the moment when the barometric pressure starts to increase sharply and the magnitude of the increase for the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 the barometric pressure is always rising in the first 56 s of the experiment and increases sharply in the period from the 40 s to 56 s with an average rise rate of 98 7 pa s after 56 s the barometric pressure is stabilized around 1550 pa and the change of barometric pressure is smaller than that of the homogeneous vadose zone 40 50 about 450 pa fig 2a and 2b this indicates that as the particle size of the medium increases the time of the initial infiltration stage is shortened and the rate of the barometric pressure rise in the vadose zone gradually increases however the speed of the pressure rise gradually decreases in the sharp increase stage of the barometric pressure in the vadose zone meanwhile the maximum value of the barometric pressure in the stability stage in the vadose zone gradually decreases for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone the critical value of water infiltration intensity mainly depends on the critical value in the low permeability medium layer on the water transport path when the water infiltration intensity is less than the critical value the barometric pressure variation in the vadose zone during water infiltration is slight and the barometric pressure variation in the different layered heterogeneous vadose zone are consistent when the water infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 at the early stage of infiltration 0 18 s the infiltrated water is small the gas has not been compressed yet so the barometric pressure variation is slight and remains within 100 pa at this moment the barometric pressure variation in the vadose zone under the open and closed air hole conditions is consistent after 18 s of infiltration the barometric pressure varies under the open and closed air hole conditions among them the increase of barometric pressure in the vadose zone under the open air hole conditions is slight and the barometric pressure is stabilized at 170 pa after 38 s of infiltration this state is maintained until the wetting front reaches the end i e the position of the manometer in contrast the barometric pressure in the vadose zone under the closed air hole conditions starts to rise sharply at 38 s peaks around 60 s and then remains near 1400 pa until the wetting front reaches the end at 86 s fig 2c for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 the trend of barometric pressure under open and closed air hole conditions is consistent with that in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 the difference is that the barometric pressure under the closed air hole conditions rises sharply during the period from 32 s to 48 s with an average rate of 88 pa s after 48 s the barometric pressure stabilizes and reaches around 1900 pa fig 2d when the water infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value the barometric pressure variation in the vadose zone shows that the medium structures would lead to a differential change of the barometric pressure in the vadose zone under the same infiltration intensity and air hole state fig 3 the magnitude and rate of the barometric pressure rise are the largest in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 the second largest in the homogeneous vadose zone the smallest in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 and the maximum differential pressure in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 is 300 pa and 500 pa larger than the latter two respectively the following causations mainly cause these phenomena the upper medium is composed of coarse grains with large pore volumes and few pore channels for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 when the infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value the infiltrating water can easily occupy the pore channels in the upper vadose zone making it difficult for the gas to escape from the upper boundary when the water from the higher permeability medium infiltrates the double layer medium interface the saturation of the water phase in the lower permeability medium increases rapidly resulting in the narrowing of the channel for upward gas transport causing the gas in the vadose zone to gather and accumulate pressure these changes shorten the duration of the slow growth stage of barometric pressure in the vadose zone and thus start the sharp growth stage earlier compared with the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 and the homogeneous vadose zone the gas phase in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 is more easily carried by the water into the lower medium due to the higher permeability and better hydraulic conductivity which leads to a larger volume of compressed gas and a higher barometric pressure in the vadose zone in addition tough2 was used to simulate the change of barometric pressure in the vadose zone of different medium structures during water infiltration the simulation results show that when the infiltration intensity is less than the critical value the simulation results of the vadose zone of different medium structures are consistent with the experimental results when the infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value the pattern of barometric pressure variation in the simulation results is generally consistent with the measured results while the simulated results are more consistent with the measured results in the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 and the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 indicating that as the particle size of the medium increases the increase of the pore scale reduces the influence of the particle morphology which makes the actual medium parameters more consistent with the ideal parameters in the model 3 2 migration characteristics of wetting fronts during water infiltration in the vadose zone in the vadose zone the wetting front is usually formed in the process of overlying water infiltration the fronts of the wetting front have the same moisture content and are located at the front of the moisture transport and the moisture content of 0 16 is selected in this paper in the vadose zone the upper part of the wetting front has a higher moisture content and the water phase saturation gradually increases with water infiltration the lower part of the wetting front has a lower moisture content and the gas phase dominates the difference in the propulsion pattern of the wetting front is mainly influenced by the water infiltration intensity the medium structure and the barometric pressure in the vadose zone from fig 4 for the homogeneous vadose zone 40 50 the wetting front dropped about 100 mm in 160 s when the infiltration intensity was 0 7 cm min when the infiltration intensity was 1 5 cm min the wetting front dropped 259 mm in 160 s under open air hole conditions and for the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 the wetting front dropped 300 mm in 78 s when the infiltration intensity was 5 0 cm min and the wetting front in the open air hole conditions dropped 300 mm in 66 s when the infiltration intensity was 7 6 cm min this means that as the water infiltration intensity increases the advance rate of the wetting front gradually increases when the water infiltration intensity was 7 6 cm min for the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 and the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 in the initial 10 s of infiltration the change of barometric pressure in the vadose zone is small and the transport distance of the wetting front does not exceed 100 mm at this moment the advance rate of the wetting front is 7 mm s in the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 while the advance rate of the wetting front is 5 mm s in the homogeneous vadose zone 40 50 this indicates that as the medium s particle size increases the wetting front s advance rate increases gradually when the water infiltration intensity is less than the critical value the propulsion pattern and rate of the wetting front under the open and closed air hole conditions are consistent and the change of barometric pressure in the vadose zone is small which means that the propulsion pattern and rate of the wetting front are mainly affected by the water infiltration intensity and the medium structure the transport pattern of the wetting front is as above when the water infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value for the homogeneous vadose zone at the early stage of infiltration the height change curve of the wetting front under the closed and open air hole conditions is consistent and the change of barometric pressure at this period is slight the wetting front propulsion pattern and rate are mainly affected by the water infiltration intensity and medium structure at a certain point of water infiltration the barometric pressure in the vadose zone began to increase sharply at this moment the transport patterns of wetting fronts under open and closed air hole conditions began to differ for example in the homogeneous vadose zone 40 50 when the infiltration intensity is 1 5 cm min the advance rate of the wetting front under open and closed air hole conditions is almost the same before 46 s which is about 1 26 mm s after 46 s the advance rate of the wetting front under open air hole conditions is about 1 76 mm s while the average advance rate of the wetting front under closed air hole conditions is 1 44 mm s this means that during the sharp increase in barometric pressure the advance rate of the wetting front decreases due to the blockage of barometric pressure chen et al 2019 mizrahi et al 2016 in addition the advancing rate of the wetting front increases with the increase of water infiltration intensity which means that the critical time for the transition of the wetting front propulsion pattern decreases with the increase of infiltration intensity in contrast the increase in particle size of the medium leads to an increase in the critical value of infiltration intensity which results in a longer critical time for the transition of the wetting front propulsion state in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone except for the direct influence of water infiltration intensity and particle size on the transport of wetting fronts the difference in the laminar structure and abrupt change in the interface caused by the change in the particle size of the medium can lead to a significant change in the propulsion pattern and rate of the wetting fronts the transport of the wetting front in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone can be roughly divided into two stages at the early stage of water infiltration the barometric pressure is so slight that it is not enough to block the transport of the wetting front after that the barometric pressure in the vadose zone rises sharply and the transport rate of the wetting front gradually slows down due to the blocking effect of barometric pressure until the wetting front reaches the end the difference is that for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 the critical time for the transition of the wetting front propulsion pattern is more significant than that of the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 while the time taken for the wetting front to reach the end is less than that of the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 the main causations are that for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 the gas release channels are fewer so much more gas is compressed in the vadose zone resulting in the rise in barometric pressure thus the blocking effect on the wetting front is more obvious in a short time in addition when the infiltration intensity and infiltration time are constant it is observed that the advance rate of the wetting front in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 is slower than in the homogeneous vadose zone and the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 yu et al 2019 the low permeability medium controls the water infiltration process for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 the low permeability medium reduces infiltration and the smaller the particle size the stronger the effect of reducing infiltration yu et al 2019 in this paper the particle size of the homogeneous medium 20 30 0 713 mm is about twice that of the homogeneous medium 40 50 0 359 mm the barometric pressure variation in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 is more significant than that in the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 and the blocking effect on the wetting fronts is stronger during the experiment which is consistent with the previous studies wei et al 2020 3 3 resistivity variation during water infiltration in the vadose zone 3 3 1 response of resistivity to moisture content moisture is one of the dominant factors affecting resistivity in the vadose zone this paper quantifies the relationship between the resistivity and moisture content of the vadose zone by setting up water saturation release tests in the homogeneous vadose zone 40 50 and 20 30 and the fitted relationship between resistivity and moisture content is consistent with previous studies it also implies a homogeneous medium structure for the wet loading in the experiments of this paper see fig 5 the empirical equation of resistivity applies to saturated pure sandstone and cohesionless soil without considering the electrical conductivity of solid particles as follows archie 1942 5 ρ s ρ w φ m among them ρ s represents the measured resistivity ω m represents the experimental parameter varying from 0 5 to 1 5 and the empirical value of the loose sandstone is 1 ρ w represents the pore water resistivity ω m φ represents the porosity m represents the cementation coefficient related to the cement and the arrangement of the skeletal particles and the empirical value is 1 3 the improved archie formula is applied to unsaturated pure sandstone and cohesionless sand and the empirical equation of resistivity is as follows 6 ρ ρ w φ m s r n where s r represents the saturation n represents the saturation index which depends on the medium type and ranges from 1 0 to 2 5 in this paper the ratio of resistivity of the saturated sand layer ρ s and measured resistivity is used as a whole eliminating the effects of pore water resistivity and pore structure and simplifying the calculation process finally the empirical equation for the resistivity of the vadose zone applicable to the water infiltration is obtained see equations 7 and 8 7 θ φ ρ s ρ 1 n 8 ρ ρ s φ θ n the quantitative relationship between moisture content and resistivity in the homogeneous medium 40 50 and 20 30 was determined by the sandbox satiation release test fig 5 as shown in equations 9 and 10 the determinacy coefficients are 0 92 and 0 93 respectively which means that the fitting results are well 9 ρ 50 97 0 34 θ 1 2 10 ρ 54 32 0 32 θ 1 2 the resistivity of the medium decreases exponentially with the increase in moisture content when the moisture content is low a slight increase in moisture can significantly reduce the resistivity of the medium in contrast when the moisture content is high the reduction in resistivity decreases as the moisture increases the causation is that the porosity of the medium layer is 0 32 at the early stages of water infiltration the pores in the medium layer are mainly filled with gas and there are fewer effective water channels as the moisture content increases the dielectric layer changes from the original particle dominated to moisture dominated so the increase in moisture leads to a substantial reduction in resistivity when the moisture content in the medium layer exceeds a certain value the continued growth in moisture will not cause a significant change in the already good moisture channel connectivity of the medium layer at this moment the increase in moisture content does not have a significant effect on resistivity wang 2021 the water infiltration in the vadose zone is a process of water gas two phase repulsion equilibrium and the resistivity of the vadose zone is jointly affected by the moisture content and the barometric pressure in the vadose zone however during the water infiltration the upper part of the wetting front is fully infiltrated by moisture and the response of the resistivity to moisture content masks the effect of barometric pressure therefore the direct impact of barometric pressure on resistivity in the upper part of the wetting front can be ignored still the barometric pressure changes the moisture content of the wetting front s upper part by influencing the wetting front s propulsion pattern and rate chen et al 2019 mizrahi et al 2016 which indirectly changes the resistivity of the vadose zone the resistivity in the homogeneous vadose zone 40 50 when the water infiltration intensity is 0 7 cm min or 1 5 cm min is significantly higher than that in the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 when the infiltration intensity is 5 0 cm min or 7 6 cm min and the layered heterogeneous vadose zone when the infiltration intensity is 7 6 cm min fig 6 the primary causation for this phenomenon is that the low permeability of the homogeneous vadose zone 40 50 leads to slow infiltration of moisture when the medium resistivity in the monitoring point was measured the moisture had not yet reached the monitoring point resulting in a sizeable measured resistivity value with a maximum value of over 7000 ω m for the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 and the layered heterogeneous vadose zone the resistivity measurement speed during the experiment always lagged behind the advancing speed of the wetting front for the first layer of the sandbox surface depth 0 15 mm it took 36 s to complete the resistivity measurement at all monitoring points and it can be seen from fig 4 that the wetting front had moved at least 146 mm downward at this time and at this time the measured value represents the resistivity of the infiltrated vadose zone the change of measurement layer makes the measured values of resistivity jump at different periods under the same conditions in addition the resistivity gradually increases with the increase of monitoring depth the measured value of the same layer gradually decreases during water infiltration which is caused by the moisture content of the vadose zone at the same depth gradually increasing with the water infiltration the increase of the moisture content of the lower vadose zone always lags behind that of the upper vadose zone in addition the data of the 21 resistivity monitoring points in the first layer of the vadose zone occurred in a stratified phenomenon which is caused by that the transport speed of the wetting front is low due to the low water infiltration intensity and when ert starts to measure the medium resistivity of the monitoring point in the first layer the moisture has not yet infiltrated into the first layer so the measured value is larger now when ert continues to measure the medium resistivity of the remaining monitoring points in the first layer the moisture has already infiltrated into the monitoring position and the measured values represent the resistivity of the infiltrated vadose zone so the measured value is significantly lower as the water infiltration intensity increases the transport rate of the wetting front gradually increases and the stratification of measured values at the first layer of resistivity monitoring points will appear earlier fig 6 when the water infiltration intensity is less than the critical value the barometric pressure in the vadose zone is minimal and almost does not affect the wetting front therefore the propulsion pattern and rate of the wetting front under the open and closed air hole conditions are consistent leading to the same measured resistivity values due to the similarity of the moisture distribution characteristics when the water infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value for the homogeneous vadose zone the barometric pressure at the early infiltration stage is minimal and its influence on the wetting front is negligible therefore the resistivity of the upper part of the wetting front is consistent under the open and closed air hole conditions at a certain infiltration time the barometric pressure in the vadose zone rises sharply and starts to block the wetting front transport therefore the transport position of the wetting front under the closed air hole conditions always lags behind that under the open air hole conditions and the moisture content of the vadose zone under the closed air hole conditions is more significant than under the open air hole conditions the resistivity in the vadose zone is mainly determined by the moisture content the greater the water content the smaller the resistivity it can be found that during the gas phase blocking effect is obvious the resistivity under the closed air hole conditions is always smaller than under the open air hole conditions fig 6a and 6b the increase in water infiltration intensity will lead to an increase in the advance rate of the wetting front the shortening of the critical time for the transition of the wetting front propulsion pattern and the increase in the speed of the moisture content rises in the vadose zone so that the measured resistivity values at the same level in the vadose zone gradually decrease and the magnitude of the decrease gradually increases the increase in the particle size of the medium will lead to a rise in the critical value of the infiltration intensity which will cause the critical time for the transition of the wetting front propulsion pattern to be prolonged thus the measured resistivity values at the same level in the vadose zone gradually decrease and the magnitude of the decrease gradually decreases as is shown in fig 6a and 6b for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone the difference in the laminar structure and abrupt change in the interface caused by changes in the particle size of the medium lead to a significant change in the propulsion pattern and speed of the wetting front for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 the critical time for the transition of the wetting front propulsion pattern is more significant than that of the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 while the time spent for the wetting front to reach the end point is smaller than that of the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 as a result the measured resistivity values at the same level in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 decrease more slowly than in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 as in fig 6c and 6d and the resistivity inversion results during water infiltration in the vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 λ 7 6 cm min 40 50 λ 0 7 cm min can be found in figure s1 3 3 2 response of resistivity to barometric pressure in water infiltration in the vadose zone the moisture content in the lower part of the wetting front is low at this moment the effect of the barometric pressure in the vadose zone on the resistivity can t be ignored and the resistivity change in the lower part of the wetting front is the joint effect of moisture content and barometric pressure the calculated resistivity of the vadose zone by the improved archie equation represents the effect of moisture content so the difference between the measured values and calculated values of resistivity represents the quantitative effect of barometric pressure variation on resistivity in the vadose zone in the vadose zone when the water infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value the three stages of the resistivity variation in the lower part of the wetting front corresponds to the barometric pressure variation namely the initial stabilization stage the declining stage and the sharp drop stage the wetting front reaches the resistivity monitoring point is the cause of the sharp drop in the resistivity of the vadose zone see fig 7 for the homogeneous vadose 40 50 when the water infiltration intensity is 1 5 cm min at the initial stabilization stage 0 48 s the resistivity of the vadose zone is stabilized at 419 ω m at the declining stage 48 s 212 s the barometric pressure of the vadose zone increases sharply to 2000 pa at which time a slight abrupt decrease in resistivity occurs and gradually decreases to 321 63 ω m at the sharp drop stage 212 s 260 s the wetting front reaches the resistivity monitoring point and the resistivity of the vadose zone drops sharply to 76 98 ω m due to the sharp increase in moisture content and keeps decreasing until it stabilizes around 57 ω m before the wetting front reaches the monitoring point the maximum moisture content of the monitoring position is 0 075 and the calculated resistivity value is ρ 312 62 ω m using equation 9 which differs from the background resistivity value before infiltration by δρ 106 94 ω m at the same time the difference between measured resistivity is δρ 97 37 ω m therefore δρ δρ 9 57 ω m namely the barometric pressure makes the resistivity drop by 9 57 ω m before the wetting front reaches the monitoring position when the water infiltration intensity is 7 6 cm min the resistivity change characteristics are like the above scenario for the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 and the layered heterogeneous vadose zone the difference is that for the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 the increased barometric pressure decreases the resistivity by 4 68 ω m for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 and upper 20 30 lower 40 50 the increased barometric pressure decreases the resistivity by 3 82 ω m and 6 17 ω m respectively for the homogeneous vadose zone 40 50 when the water infiltration intensity is 1 5 cm min the barometric pressure increases by about 2048 pa under the closed air hole condition when the infiltration intensity is 7 6 cm min the barometric pressure in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 increases by about 1887 pa the barometric pressure in the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 increases by about 1589 pa and the barometric pressure in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 increases by about 1408 pa the resistivity reduction values of the vadose zone corresponding to the above barometric pressure variations are 9 57 ω m 6 17 ω m 4 68 ω m and 3 82 ω m accounting for 10 90 8 77 7 73 and 6 07 of the resistivity reduction due to the moisture content change respectively the results show that there is a significant negative correlation between barometric pressure and resistivity in the vadose zone namely increased barometric pressure decreases the resistivity in the vadose zone and the more significant the increase in barometric pressure the greater the reduction in resistivity which is consistent with the previous studies chen 2013 yamasaki and arai 2008 on the other hand the contribution of increased barometric pressure to the decrease in resistivity of the vadose zone is significant with a maximum percentage of 10 90 while the barometric pressure variation caused by water infiltration in laboratory experiments is limited it can be expected that the contribution of barometric pressure to the change of resistivity will be greater when the barometric pressure variation is more significant in this paper the barometric pressure variation in the vadose zone is caused by water infiltration when the water infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value most of the pore channels above the wetting front are filled with moisture and the gas phase cannot be freely released and thus is compressed inside the vadose zone in a closed system composed of solid liquid gas phases in which the free charges move in a small range under the influence of the ert electric field the barometric pressure variation changes the number of free charges within the system which affects the resistivity within the system there is a positive correlation between the number of free charges in the system and the magnitude of the increase in barometric pressure namely the higher the barometric pressure due to the gas compression the greater the number of free charges in the cell and the lower the resistivity in the system li and oldenburg 1991 and the amplitude of resistivity change increases with barometric pressure change in addition when the barometric pressure is large enough the increased barometric pressure decreases the resistivity of the medium by improving the moisture content compressing pore structure reducing porosity and other properties of the soil medium ma et al 2016 brace and orange 1968 brace et al 1965 3 4 micro mechanism analysis of barometric pressure variation and resistivity response during water infiltration in the vadose zone in the process of water infiltration in the vadose zone significant changes in barometric pressure in the vadose zone usually require a high infiltration intensity or highly permeable homogeneous medium with strong pore connectivity which makes it easier for water to form a uniform surface infiltration and isolate the vadose zone from the atmosphere as the infiltrated water accumulates and migrates downward the gas in the vadose zone is continuously compressed the barometric pressure increases until it reaches the air breaking critical value the value is equal to the sum of soil surface head wetting front height and inlet pressure of soil water same below the gas will break through the overlying water to form an airflow channel and release it from the upper boundary berg et al 2014 haines 1930 and the water infiltration rate reaches the minimum close to zero after that the barometric pressure decreases rapidly and when it reaches the air closing critical value the airflow channel is occupied by water again and the water infiltration rate reaches the maximum at this moment wang et al 1998 grismer et al 1994 touma and vauclin 1986 peck 1965a peck 1965b when the barometric pressure in the vadose zone reaches a critical value of stability the rate of gas release is equal to the speed of water infiltration and then the barometric pressure stabilizes at this critical value and forms a continuous gas channel in the vadose zone grismer et al 1994 touma and vauclin 1986 the micro mechanism of barometric pressure change threshold during water infiltration can be better explained using the percolation theory hunt et al 2014 that is when the gas channel is entirely occupied by water during water infiltration the barometric pressure in the vadose zone cannot be released and changes abruptly from a slow rise to a sharp increase under the action of gravity and capillary forces of the infiltrated water the resistivity of the vadose zone reflects the electrical conductivity of the medium which is weighted by the structure components water saturation solute concentration and temperature of the medium in general the looser the medium structure the greater the resistivity the higher the content of clay minerals the lower the medium resistivity shevnin et al 2007 the increase in water saturation and solute concentration generally decreases the medium resistivity comina et al 2010 earon et al 2012 siddiqui and osman 2013 archie 1942 as the temperature rises at room temperature the solubility and ionization of electrolytes in the pore water will increase resulting in a decrease in medium resistivity delaney et al 2001 keller and frischknecht 1966 in contrast the water infiltration in the vadose zone is a process in which the medium is alternately saturated and unsaturated and this process causes a change in the medium resistivity on the one hand the accumulation of infiltrated water increases the moisture content causing a decrease in resistivity and this process controls the entire moisture affected zone michot et al 2003 the micro mechanism is revealed by using micro element statistical methods when the moisture content is low the distribution of water micro elements is initially disconnected and discrete as the moisture content increases the water micro elements gradually show intermittent fine line distribution when the moisture content is greater than the critical value the isolation of water micro elements is broken and multiple continuous paths are formed and the medium resistivity changes abruptly with the further increase of moisture content the water micro elements in the medium are interconnected to form a network structure and the decreasing trend of medium resistivity will slow down at this moment wang 2021 on the other hand during the increase of barometric pressure in the vadose zone the medium structure becomes denser and the gas compression increases the number of free charges per unit volume which leads to a decrease in resistivity li and oldenburg 1991 and this effect is obvious in the lower part of the wetting front in the vadose zone a conceptual diagram of the micro mechanism of barometric pressure changes and resistivity response during water infiltration in the vadose zone can be found in fig 8 4 conclusions the water infiltration in the vadose zone is a process of water gas two phase repulsion equilibrium which is influenced by various factors such as water infiltration intensity medium structure and barometric pressure this paper studied the barometric pressure variation during water infiltration in the vadose zone based on laboratory experiments and numerical simulations further study of the resistivity response to the barometric pressure variation was carried out using ert and the following conclusions were drawn the critical value of water infiltration intensity exists in the vadose zone which depends on the medium properties and structure the critical value of water infiltration intensity gradually increases as the permeability decreases and the critical infiltration intensity in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone depends on the critical value in the low permeability medium layer on the water transport path when the water infiltration intensity is less than the critical value the infiltrated water cannot wrap the gas in the vadose zone so the barometric pressure is minimal when the water infiltration intensity exceeds the critical value the barometric pressure change in the vadose zone will go through three stages slow growth sharp increase and stability with the rise of the water infiltration intensity the time taken for the slow growth and the sharp increase of barometric pressure gradually shortens in contrast the maximum value of the barometric pressure gradually increases when the water infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value with the increase of the medium s particle size the slow growth stage of the barometric pressure in the vadose zone is shortened and the rate of barometric pressure rise gradually increases for the sharp increase stage of the barometric pressure in the vadose zone the rate of barometric pressure rise gradually decreases finally the maximum value of the barometric pressure in the vadose zone gradually decreases for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 the higher permeability makes it easier for the gas phase to be carried by water into the lower medium making the gas phase more saturated and the volume of the compressed gas phase larger and the final barometric pressure in the vadose zone is higher the comparison between the results of laboratory experiments and the numerical simulations shows that as the particle size of the medium increases the pore scale s effect masks the particle morphology s effect making the actual medium parameters more closely match the ideal parameters in the model in water infiltration as the water infiltration intensity and the particle size of the medium increase the rate of wetting front transport gradually increases and the increased barometric pressure in the vadose zone blocks the wetting front transport the resistivity of the vadose zone is mainly affected by the moisture content and responds to barometric pressure variations in the vadose zone in the vadose zone s upper part of the wetting front the effect of moisture content variation on resistivity masks the direct response of resistivity to barometric pressure variation however barometric pressure changes the moisture content of the wetting front s upper vadose zone by affecting the wetting front s propulsion pattern and rate indirectly changing the vadose zone s resistivity in the lower part of the wetting front the response of resistivity to the barometric pressure variation is obvious due to the low moisture content when the water infiltration intensity exceeds the critical value the resistivity variation can be roughly divided into the initial stabilization stage the declining stage and the sharp drop stage corresponding to the barometric pressure variation meanwhile the relationship between the resistivity and the moisture content in the vadose zone meets the generalized archie equation and the generalized archie formula between the resistivity and the moisture content in the homogeneous medium 40 50 and the homogeneous medium 20 30 is ρ 50 97 0 34 θ 1 2 and ρ 54 32 0 32 θ 1 2 respectively the difference in resistivity between the measured values and the calculated values by the improved archie equation can be used to depict the response of resistivity to barometric pressure variation and quantify their relationship in the vadose zone the results show that the contribution of increased barometric pressure to the decrease in resistivity of the vadose zone is significant with a maximum percentage exceeding 10 90 of the moisture content contribution and the increased barometric pressure decreases the resistivity of the medium by improving the moisture content compressing pore structure decreasing porosity and other properties of the soil medium and the increase in the number of free charges per unit volume due to the gas compression is an important and most neglected factor in the reduction of the resistivity of the vadose zone data availability statement the experimental and synthetic raw data used for the image process and analysis in this study are available at

1819,to reveal the mechanism of the water gas two phase repulsion during water infiltration and its barometric pressure change and resistivity response in the vadose zone while it provides the basic theory for water resources evaluation and groundwater pollution also provides technical support for the accurate interpretation of electrical resistivity tomography ert application therefore a research system based on laboratory experiments numerical simulations and ert was established to determine the moisture transport pattern and the quantitative relationships between barometric pressure and resistivity the results show that the intensity of the water infiltration process in the vadose zone meets the percolation theory the barometric pressure will go through three stages when the infiltration intensity is higher than the critical value the critical time of the barometric pressure variation shortens gradually with the infiltration intensity and medium permeability increase in contrast the maximum barometric pressure increases gradually with the rise in infiltration intensity and medium porosity the layered heterogeneous structure s effect depends on the underlying medium s properties the trivial variation of resistivity responds to the barometric pressure variation the quantitative relationship between the resistivity and the barometric pressure in the vadose zone is established by the difference between the measured value and the calculated value by improving archie s formula the resistivity reduction due to increasing barometric pressure can account for over 10 9 of the moisture effect these insights provide technical support for ert applications to eliminate barometric pressure s effect on resistivity and accurately identify the target medium keywords barometric pressure resistivity ert water infiltration vadose zone data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the vadose zone is a conduit for water exchange in the earth s shallow rims groundwater receives recharge from infiltration of atmospheric precipitation and surface water through the vadose zone and discharges through evaporation in the vadose zone therefore water transport in the vadose zone is vital to the hydrological cycle stephens et al 2018 arora and ahmed 2011 water transport in the vadose zone has become a hot topic in many disciplines investigating water transport in the vadose zone is of great practical significance for studying water resource evaluation groundwater pollution agricultural irrigation and other issues jiang et al 2021 singh et al 2018 the water transport in the vadose zone is a process of water gas two phase displacement which usually causes changes in the barometric pressure however the effect of barometric pressure variation is often ignored in traditional studies of water transport in the vadose zone i e it is assumed that the gas expulsion process is always unrestricted only a few researchers have paid attention to the influence of the gas phase and have done some studies on the water gas interaction during water infiltration in the vadose zone hardie et al 2012 sun et al 2008 peng et al 2002 weeks 2002 culligan et al 2000 among them wang et al 1997 found that the infiltration rate of moisture is lower under closed air conditions than under exhaust conditions in the soil column infiltration experiments in the process of the gas being compressed the barometric pressure rises continuously to a certain extent the air will break through the overlying water bearing layer to escape from the gas channels out of the system at that time the barometric pressure will rapidly decrease and when it decreases to a certain extent the previously formed gas channels are re occupied by moisture wei et al 2020 kong et al 2009 wang et al 1998 linden and dixon 1976 found through site infiltration experiments that a rise in barometric pressure in the soil from 0 kpa to 0 5 kpa was sufficient to cause an order of magnitude decrease in infiltration flow rate wei et al 2020 proposed an equation to predict the critical water infiltration intensity for a porous medium which is established by the permeability and pore size distribution of the porous medium it was found that critical water infiltration intensity increases with the permeability of the porous medium and increases as the pore size becomes more uniform in addition the change of barometric pressure due to the water infiltration impacts the resistivity of the vadose zone however previous studies have mainly focused on the effect of medium pore structure changes triggered by high pressure conditions on resistivity in large scale field or laboratory experiments while there is a lack of research on the impact of barometric pressure variation on resistivity during water infiltration henine et al 2021 brace and orange 1968 brace et al 1965 for example chen 2019 carried out a physical simulation study of an air rich soil layer and the results showed that the resistivity of the soil increased with inflation the causation is that with the increase of inflation the barometric pressure keeps rising which makes the moisture in the soil extrude and the resistivity larger li 2010a li 2010b conducted a field observation study of soil electrical conductivity characteristics and barometric pressure the results show that there is a phase positive or negative correlation characteristic between soil resistivity and monthly average barometric pressure and the change of resistivity is the result of the joint influence of barometric pressure and other meteorological factors yamasaki and arai 2008 conducted pressurization experiments on core samples using air and found that the resistivity changed by 5 to 25 under different barometric pressure conditions the causation is that when the barometric pressure increases to a certain degree the pore structure of the medium changes and the original large pores in the medium become tiny pores or even micro pores so that the medium particles become denser and resistivity becomes smaller zhou et al 2011 in the water infiltration process in the vadose zone the barometric pressure affects the transport of the wetting front which in turn affects the spatial distribution of moisture content and leads to the change of resistivity in addition the changes in medium structure and free charges induced by the barometric pressure variation can directly lead to changes in resistivity however the mechanisms involved need to be further investigated therefore there is an urgent need to conduct experimental research on the relationship between barometric pressure and resistivity under variable controllable conditions in water infiltration in the vadose zone the traditional research methods of water transport in the vadose zone include laboratory experiments and numerical simulations laboratory experiments provide a necessary and effective means to study the pattern of water gas two phase displacement in the water infiltration process in the vadose zone while numerical simulation has become an essential tool for analyzing and solving groundwater problems due to their convenience and efficiency sun et al 2015 niessner et al 2009 navarro et al 2008 weir and kissling 1992 felton and reddell 1992 in addition geophysical methods such as electrical resistivity tomography ert are also commonly used ert is based on the difference in electrical properties between the target body and the environmental medium and uses electrodes placed on the surface to obtain the resistivity response characteristics at different depth locations which can identify the deep medium properties therefore ert is widely used in hydrogeological fields such as karst investigation stratigraphic distribution dam leakage detection and water transport processes in the vadose zone because of its many advantages such as in situ non destructive convenient operation and reliable results zhu et al 2020 caterina et al 2017 dietrich et al 2014 power et al 2013 islam et al 2012 garré et al 2012 garré et al 2010 atekwana et al 2000 however for water and solute transport monitoring studies in the vadose zone using ert the target mainly focuses on moisture while the effect of the barometric pressure is always ignored or underestimated qiang et al 2022 kang et al 2021 li 2010a li 2010b touma et al 1984 which results in an overestimation of the moisture transport rate and a misrepresentation of the actual situation of moisture transport and the target body extending to various fields of applied ert the neglect of the barometric pressure within the medium can directly lead to the misrepresentation of the target body therefore it is important to determine the quantitative relationship between barometric pressure and resistivity within a porous medium which is complementary to the accurate inferential identification of the properties and morphology of the target body using ert in the above background to reveal the intrinsic mechanism of the water gas two phase repulsion and the influence of barometric pressure variation on resistivity in the vadose zone during the water infiltration sieve out the errors of resistivity response to barometric pressure changes and realize the scientific application of ert and the accurate interpretation of data the research system combining laboratory experiments and numerical simulations with the ert is established in this paper the main innovative objectives are as follows 1 to reveal the displacement pattern of water gas two phases during the water infiltration in the vadose zone 2 to elucidate the pattern of barometric pressure change and influence mechanism during the water infiltration in the vadose zone 3 to fully reveal the potential influence mechanism and quantitative relationship of barometric pressure change on electrical resistivity in the vadose zone which provides theoretical support for the application of geophysical electrical methods and the accurate interpretation of data 2 materials and methods 2 1 theoretical background water transport in the vadose zone is two phase or even multi phase displacement process and the effect of the gas phase in the vadose zone can be summarized as three types including the viscous effect the hysteresis effect and the compression effect among them the gas s compression effect is that it is compressed due to the restricted release and the increased barometric pressure blocks the water infiltration and reduces the rate of water infiltration the motion of the water and gas phases in the vadose zone follows the law of conservation of mass and energy and darcy s law can be extended to the gas phase when considering the water gas two phase flow 1 v β k k r β μ β p β ρ β g where β represents the fluid phase gas phase or water phase v β represents the permeable flow rate of β phase m s k represents absolute permeability of the medium m2 k r β represents relative permeability of β phase p β represents the pressure of β phase n ρ β represents the density of β phase kg m3 g represents gravitational acceleration m s2 for the transport of water gas two phase in the vadose zone assuming that the pores of the vadose zone are filled with water and gas phases and based on the law of conservation of mass without considering the deformation of the solid skeleton the basic equations for the transport of water and gas phases are as follows 2 n s β ρ β t d i v ρ β v β 0 where n represents porosity s β represents saturation of β phase the meaning of other parameters is the same as in equation 1 substituting equation 1 into equation 2 yields the following equation 3 n

laboratory experiments is made of glass and the internal dimensions are 55 cm 45 cm 2 5 cm length height width the upper boundary of the sandbox simulates the contact boundary between the vadose zone and the atmosphere to receive water infiltration in contrast the left right and bottom boundaries are closed so they are isolated from the external environment during the experiment an intelligent manual device was used to ensure uniform water infiltration at the upper boundary of the sandbox three rows and three columns of nine air holes are distributed on the front of the sandbox and three barometers are installed in the bottom row of air holes 15 cm from the bottom of the sandbox to monitor the change of barometric pressure in the sandbox during the water infiltration see fig 1 a a differential pressure barometer testo 510i was used for this experiment and the measured barometric pressure data were recorded on a mobile terminal via bluetooth the barometer range is 15000 pa 15000 pa the measurement accuracy is 5 pa and the sampling interval is 2 s it should be noted that since the measured values of the three barometers were close less than 10 pa difference in the subsequent experiments the average measured values of the three barometers were taken to represent the barometric pressure in the vadose zone in this paper in addition the electrodes were placed on the surface and bottom of the experimental sandbox to monitor the apparent resistivity of the vadose zone at the upper and lower part of the wetting front respectively to study the response of the apparent resistivity of the vadose zone to water infiltration under the influence of the wetting front the apparent resistivity is referred to as resistivity throughout this paper the duk 2 high density electrophotometer produced by chongqing geological instrument factory was selected see fig 1a before each set of experiments was conducted the medium quartz sand was soaked in dilute nitric acid which was washed with deionized water until ph was neutral and finally dried and filled into the sandbox using the wet method the parameters of the two quartz sands selected in this study are shown in table 1 2 3 numerical experiments in this paper the numerical simulation of water gas two phase flow was performed based on the eos3 module in petrasim a visualization software developed by tough2 the experimental sandbox is generalized to a two dimensional model of water gas two phase flow in the vadose zone under infiltration conditions and the schematic diagram of the sandbox model is shown in fig 1a the dimension of the generalized model is 55 cm 45 cm 2 5 cm x axis z axis y axis and the left γ2 right γ3 and lower γ4 boundaries are generalized to zero flux boundaries the infiltrated water is added to the upper boundary γ1 as a source sink term via a type ii boundary condition for the water phase for the gas phase γ1 is generalized to a fixed atmospheric boundary 1 013e5 pa the grid profile is shown in fig 1b and the grid s horizontal and vertical spacing is 1 cm the first grid layer γ1 is used as the infiltration recharge source and the models are all set to a constant temperature of 25 c the main parameters of the medium are set according to table 1 the numerical simulation scenarios are set according to table 2 and the model parameters are set according to table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 barometric pressure variation during water infiltration in the vadose zone 3 1 1 water infiltration intensity the change in water infiltration intensity will lead to the differential barometric pressure change in the vadose zone during water infiltration there is a critical value of water infiltration intensity when the water infiltration intensity of the vadose zone is less than the critical value the change in barometric pressure is minimal however when the infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value the barometric pressure in the vadose zone shows a trend of three stages and the critical value of water infiltration intensity is different for different medium structures of the vadose zone for example the critical infiltration intensity ranges from 0 72 cm min to 1 25 cm min in the 40 50 mesh homogeneous vadose zone and the critical infiltration intensity ranges from 5 82 cm min to 7 27 cm min in the 20 30 mesh homogeneous vadose zone wei et al 2020 in the vadose zone the change in barometric pressure is small when the water infiltration intensity is less than the critical value the change of barometric pressure under closed air hole conditions is consistent with that under open air hole conditions fig 2 indicating that when the infiltration intensity is less than the critical value the infiltrated water is not enough to occupy most of the pore channels in the vadose zone resulting in the moisture in the upper layer of the vadose zone not being able to form a wrapping effect on the gas in the lower layer therefore no matter whether the air holes are open or closed the gas phase can always be freely released from the top boundary of the sandbox along the pore channels and the barometric pressure of the vadose zone will not change obviously assouline 2013 broadbridge et al 2009 when the water infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value the change of the barometric pressure in the vadose zone under open air hole conditions is close to that of the infiltration intensity is less than the critical value and it always fluctuates in a small range in contrast the barometric pressure in the vadose zone under closed air hole conditions changes significantly and goes through three stages including slow growth sharp increase and stability fig 2 at the early stage of water infiltration more than the infiltrated water is needed to occupy most of the pore channels in the upper layer of the vadose zone as the water moves downward the compressed gas will be released from the pore channels or break through the cohesive force between the water to form gas channels the barometric pressure in the vadose zone increases slowly with the increase of infiltrated water when the water in the vadose zone is enough to occupy most of the pore channels the gas in the vadose zone is wrapped by the upper layer of water it cannot be effectively released so the gas is continuously compressed and the barometric pressure increases rapidly when the dynamic equilibrium is reached between the increased barometric pressure and the pressure of the infiltrated water the lower layer of gas will forcefully break through the upper layer of water to release as the water continues to infiltrate thus maintaining the stability of barometric pressure wei et al 2020 kong et al 2009 wang et al 1998 when the water infiltration intensity exceeds the critical value with the increase of the water infiltration intensity the time of the slow growth stage and the sharp increase stage of the barometric pressure will be shortened the maximum value of the barometric pressure in the stability stage will be slightly increased which means that the rate of barometric pressure variation rises with the increase of the water infiltration intensity in addition tough2 was used to simulate the change of barometric pressure in the vadose zone with the water infiltration intensity the simulation results show that when the infiltration intensity is less than the critical value the simulation results are consistent with the experimental results both show that the barometric pressure in the vadose zone fluctuates in a small range when the infiltration intensity exceeds the critical value the simulated results show the same pattern as the measured results however the difference between the actual medium characteristics and the ideal parameters selected by the model leads to a slight difference between the measured and simulated results 3 1 2 medium properties the medium structure of the vadose zone is another important factor affecting the barometric pressure in the vadose zone during water infiltration the results show that in the homogeneous vadose zone the critical value of water infiltration intensity increases gradually as the particle size of the medium increases the critical value of water infiltration intensity in layered heterogeneous vadose zone mainly depends on the critical value in the low permeability media layer on the moisture transport path wei et al 2020 for the homogeneous vadose zone when the water infiltration intensity is less than the critical value the barometric pressure variation during water infiltration is slight and the barometric pressure variation under the open and closed air hole conditions is consistent with the increase of the medium s particle size the barometric pressure rate in the vadose zone gradually increases when the water infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value for the homogeneous vadose zone 40 50 the barometric pressure is always rising in the first 62 s of the experiment it increases sharply from 46 s to 62 s with an average rise rate of 101 pa s after which the barometric pressure is stabilized around 2000 pa for the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 there was a significant difference in the barometric pressure variation between the open and closed air hole conditions like that of the homogeneous vadose zone 40 50 however the two structure of the vadose zone is different in terms of the moment when the barometric pressure starts to increase sharply and the magnitude of the increase for the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 the barometric pressure is always rising in the first 56 s of the experiment and increases sharply in the period from the 40 s to 56 s with an average rise rate of 98 7 pa s after 56 s the barometric pressure is stabilized around 1550 pa and the change of barometric pressure is smaller than that of the homogeneous vadose zone 40 50 about 450 pa fig 2a and 2b this indicates that as the particle size of the medium increases the time of the initial infiltration stage is shortened and the rate of the barometric pressure rise in the vadose zone gradually increases however the speed of the pressure rise gradually decreases in the sharp increase stage of the barometric pressure in the vadose zone meanwhile the maximum value of the barometric pressure in the stability stage in the vadose zone gradually decreases for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone the critical value of water infiltration intensity mainly depends on the critical value in the low permeability medium layer on the water transport path when the water infiltration intensity is less than the critical value the barometric pressure variation in the vadose zone during water infiltration is slight and the barometric pressure variation in the different layered heterogeneous vadose zone are consistent when the water infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 at the early stage of infiltration 0 18 s the infiltrated water is small the gas has not been compressed yet so the barometric pressure variation is slight and remains within 100 pa at this moment the barometric pressure variation in the vadose zone under the open and closed air hole conditions is consistent after 18 s of infiltration the barometric pressure varies under the open and closed air hole conditions among them the increase of barometric pressure in the vadose zone under the open air hole conditions is slight and the barometric pressure is stabilized at 170 pa after 38 s of infiltration this state is maintained until the wetting front reaches the end i e the position of the manometer in contrast the barometric pressure in the vadose zone under the closed air hole conditions starts to rise sharply at 38 s peaks around 60 s and then remains near 1400 pa until the wetting front reaches the end at 86 s fig 2c for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 the trend of barometric pressure under open and closed air hole conditions is consistent with that in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 the difference is that the barometric pressure under the closed air hole conditions rises sharply during the period from 32 s to 48 s with an average rate of 88 pa s after 48 s the barometric pressure stabilizes and reaches around 1900 pa fig 2d when the water infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value the barometric pressure variation in the vadose zone shows that the medium structures would lead to a differential change of the barometric pressure in the vadose zone under the same infiltration intensity and air hole state fig 3 the magnitude and rate of the barometric pressure rise are the largest in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 the second largest in the homogeneous vadose zone the smallest in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 and the maximum differential pressure in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 is 300 pa and 500 pa larger than the latter two respectively the following causations mainly cause these phenomena the upper medium is composed of coarse grains with large pore volumes and few pore channels for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 when the infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value the infiltrating water can easily occupy the pore channels in the upper vadose zone making it difficult for the gas to escape from the upper boundary when the water from the higher permeability medium infiltrates the double layer medium interface the saturation of the water phase in the lower permeability medium increases rapidly resulting in the narrowing of the channel for upward gas transport causing the gas in the vadose zone to gather and accumulate pressure these changes shorten the duration of the slow growth stage of barometric pressure in the vadose zone and thus start the sharp growth stage earlier compared with the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 and the homogeneous vadose zone the gas phase in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 is more easily carried by the water into the lower medium due to the higher permeability and better hydraulic conductivity which leads to a larger volume of compressed gas and a higher barometric pressure in the vadose zone in addition tough2 was used to simulate the change of barometric pressure in the vadose zone of different medium structures during water infiltration the simulation results show that when the infiltration intensity is less than the critical value the simulation results of the vadose zone of different medium structures are consistent with the experimental results when the infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value the pattern of barometric pressure variation in the simulation results is generally consistent with the measured results while the simulated results are more consistent with the measured results in the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 and the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 indicating that as the particle size of the medium increases the increase of the pore scale reduces the influence of the particle morphology which makes the actual medium parameters more consistent with the ideal parameters in the model 3 2 migration characteristics of wetting fronts during water infiltration in the vadose zone in the vadose zone the wetting front is usually formed in the process of overlying water infiltration the fronts of the wetting front have the same moisture content and are located at the front of the moisture transport and the moisture content of 0 16 is selected in this paper in the vadose zone the upper part of the wetting front has a higher moisture content and the water phase saturation gradually increases with water infiltration the lower part of the wetting front has a lower moisture content and the gas phase dominates the difference in the propulsion pattern of the wetting front is mainly influenced by the water infiltration intensity the medium structure and the barometric pressure in the vadose zone from fig 4 for the homogeneous vadose zone 40 50 the wetting front dropped about 100 mm in 160 s when the infiltration intensity was 0 7 cm min when the infiltration intensity was 1 5 cm min the wetting front dropped 259 mm in 160 s under open air hole conditions and for the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 the wetting front dropped 300 mm in 78 s when the infiltration intensity was 5 0 cm min and the wetting front in the open air hole conditions dropped 300 mm in 66 s when the infiltration intensity was 7 6 cm min this means that as the water infiltration intensity increases the advance rate of the wetting front gradually increases when the water infiltration intensity was 7 6 cm min for the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 and the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 in the initial 10 s of infiltration the change of barometric pressure in the vadose zone is small and the transport distance of the wetting front does not exceed 100 mm at this moment the advance rate of the wetting front is 7 mm s in the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 while the advance rate of the wetting front is 5 mm s in the homogeneous vadose zone 40 50 this indicates that as the medium s particle size increases the wetting front s advance rate increases gradually when the water infiltration intensity is less than the critical value the propulsion pattern and rate of the wetting front under the open and closed air hole conditions are consistent and the change of barometric pressure in the vadose zone is small which means that the propulsion pattern and rate of the wetting front are mainly affected by the water infiltration intensity and the medium structure the transport pattern of the wetting front is as above when the water infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value for the homogeneous vadose zone at the early stage of infiltration the height change curve of the wetting front under the closed and open air hole conditions is consistent and the change of barometric pressure at this period is slight the wetting front propulsion pattern and rate are mainly affected by the water infiltration intensity and medium structure at a certain point of water infiltration the barometric pressure in the vadose zone began to increase sharply at this moment the transport patterns of wetting fronts under open and closed air hole conditions began to differ for example in the homogeneous vadose zone 40 50 when the infiltration intensity is 1 5 cm min the advance rate of the wetting front under open and closed air hole conditions is almost the same before 46 s which is about 1 26 mm s after 46 s the advance rate of the wetting front under open air hole conditions is about 1 76 mm s while the average advance rate of the wetting front under closed air hole conditions is 1 44 mm s this means that during the sharp increase in barometric pressure the advance rate of the wetting front decreases due to the blockage of barometric pressure chen et al 2019 mizrahi et al 2016 in addition the advancing rate of the wetting front increases with the increase of water infiltration intensity which means that the critical time for the transition of the wetting front propulsion pattern decreases with the increase of infiltration intensity in contrast the increase in particle size of the medium leads to an increase in the critical value of infiltration intensity which results in a longer critical time for the transition of the wetting front propulsion state in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone except for the direct influence of water infiltration intensity and particle size on the transport of wetting fronts the difference in the laminar structure and abrupt change in the interface caused by the change in the particle size of the medium can lead to a significant change in the propulsion pattern and rate of the wetting fronts the transport of the wetting front in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone can be roughly divided into two stages at the early stage of water infiltration the barometric pressure is so slight that it is not enough to block the transport of the wetting front after that the barometric pressure in the vadose zone rises sharply and the transport rate of the wetting front gradually slows down due to the blocking effect of barometric pressure until the wetting front reaches the end the difference is that for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 the critical time for the transition of the wetting front propulsion pattern is more significant than that of the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 while the time taken for the wetting front to reach the end is less than that of the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 the main causations are that for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 the gas release channels are fewer so much more gas is compressed in the vadose zone resulting in the rise in barometric pressure thus the blocking effect on the wetting front is more obvious in a short time in addition when the infiltration intensity and infiltration time are constant it is observed that the advance rate of the wetting front in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 is slower than in the homogeneous vadose zone and the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 yu et al 2019 the low permeability medium controls the water infiltration process for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 the low permeability medium reduces infiltration and the smaller the particle size the stronger the effect of reducing infiltration yu et al 2019 in this paper the particle size of the homogeneous medium 20 30 0 713 mm is about twice that of the homogeneous medium 40 50 0 359 mm the barometric pressure variation in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 is more significant than that in the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 and the blocking effect on the wetting fronts is stronger during the experiment which is consistent with the previous studies wei et al 2020 3 3 resistivity variation during water infiltration in the vadose zone 3 3 1 response of resistivity to moisture content moisture is one of the dominant factors affecting resistivity in the vadose zone this paper quantifies the relationship between the resistivity and moisture content of the vadose zone by setting up water saturation release tests in the homogeneous vadose zone 40 50 and 20 30 and the fitted relationship between resistivity and moisture content is consistent with previous studies it also implies a homogeneous medium structure for the wet loading in the experiments of this paper see fig 5 the empirical equation of resistivity applies to saturated pure sandstone and cohesionless soil without considering the electrical conductivity of solid particles as follows archie 1942 5 ρ s ρ w φ m among them ρ s represents the measured resistivity ω m represents the experimental parameter varying from 0 5 to 1 5 and the empirical value of the loose sandstone is 1 ρ w represents the pore water resistivity ω m φ represents the porosity m represents the cementation coefficient related to the cement and the arrangement of the skeletal particles and the empirical value is 1 3 the improved archie formula is applied to unsaturated pure sandstone and cohesionless sand and the empirical equation of resistivity is as follows 6 ρ ρ w φ m s r n where s r represents the saturation n represents the saturation index which depends on the medium type and ranges from 1 0 to 2 5 in this paper the ratio of resistivity of the saturated sand layer ρ s and measured resistivity is used as a whole eliminating the effects of pore water resistivity and pore structure and simplifying the calculation process finally the empirical equation for the resistivity of the vadose zone applicable to the water infiltration is obtained see equations 7 and 8 7 θ φ ρ s ρ 1 n 8 ρ ρ s φ θ n the quantitative relationship between moisture content and resistivity in the homogeneous medium 40 50 and 20 30 was determined by the sandbox satiation release test fig 5 as shown in equations 9 and 10 the determinacy coefficients are 0 92 and 0 93 respectively which means that the fitting results are well 9 ρ 50 97 0 34 θ 1 2 10 ρ 54 32 0 32 θ 1 2 the resistivity of the medium decreases exponentially with the increase in moisture content when the moisture content is low a slight increase in moisture can significantly reduce the resistivity of the medium in contrast when the moisture content is high the reduction in resistivity decreases as the moisture increases the causation is that the porosity of the medium layer is 0 32 at the early stages of water infiltration the pores in the medium layer are mainly filled with gas and there are fewer effective water channels as the moisture content increases the dielectric layer changes from the original particle dominated to moisture dominated so the increase in moisture leads to a substantial reduction in resistivity when the moisture content in the medium layer exceeds a certain value the continued growth in moisture will not cause a significant change in the already good moisture channel connectivity of the medium layer at this moment the increase in moisture content does not have a significant effect on resistivity wang 2021 the water infiltration in the vadose zone is a process of water gas two phase repulsion equilibrium and the resistivity of the vadose zone is jointly affected by the moisture content and the barometric pressure in the vadose zone however during the water infiltration the upper part of the wetting front is fully infiltrated by moisture and the response of the resistivity to moisture content masks the effect of barometric pressure therefore the direct impact of barometric pressure on resistivity in the upper part of the wetting front can be ignored still the barometric pressure changes the moisture content of the wetting front s upper part by influencing the wetting front s propulsion pattern and rate chen et al 2019 mizrahi et al 2016 which indirectly changes the resistivity of the vadose zone the resistivity in the homogeneous vadose zone 40 50 when the water infiltration intensity is 0 7 cm min or 1 5 cm min is significantly higher than that in the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 when the infiltration intensity is 5 0 cm min or 7 6 cm min and the layered heterogeneous vadose zone when the infiltration intensity is 7 6 cm min fig 6 the primary causation for this phenomenon is that the low permeability of the homogeneous vadose zone 40 50 leads to slow infiltration of moisture when the medium resistivity in the monitoring point was measured the moisture had not yet reached the monitoring point resulting in a sizeable measured resistivity value with a maximum value of over 7000 ω m for the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 and the layered heterogeneous vadose zone the resistivity measurement speed during the experiment always lagged behind the advancing speed of the wetting front for the first layer of the sandbox surface depth 0 15 mm it took 36 s to complete the resistivity measurement at all monitoring points and it can be seen from fig 4 that the wetting front had moved at least 146 mm downward at this time and at this time the measured value represents the resistivity of the infiltrated vadose zone the change of measurement layer makes the measured values of resistivity jump at different periods under the same conditions in addition the resistivity gradually increases with the increase of monitoring depth the measured value of the same layer gradually decreases during water infiltration which is caused by the moisture content of the vadose zone at the same depth gradually increasing with the water infiltration the increase of the moisture content of the lower vadose zone always lags behind that of the upper vadose zone in addition the data of the 21 resistivity monitoring points in the first layer of the vadose zone occurred in a stratified phenomenon which is caused by that the transport speed of the wetting front is low due to the low water infiltration intensity and when ert starts to measure the medium resistivity of the monitoring point in the first layer the moisture has not yet infiltrated into the first layer so the measured value is larger now when ert continues to measure the medium resistivity of the remaining monitoring points in the first layer the moisture has already infiltrated into the monitoring position and the measured values represent the resistivity of the infiltrated vadose zone so the measured value is significantly lower as the water infiltration intensity increases the transport rate of the wetting front gradually increases and the stratification of measured values at the first layer of resistivity monitoring points will appear earlier fig 6 when the water infiltration intensity is less than the critical value the barometric pressure in the vadose zone is minimal and almost does not affect the wetting front therefore the propulsion pattern and rate of the wetting front under the open and closed air hole conditions are consistent leading to the same measured resistivity values due to the similarity of the moisture distribution characteristics when the water infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value for the homogeneous vadose zone the barometric pressure at the early infiltration stage is minimal and its influence on the wetting front is negligible therefore the resistivity of the upper part of the wetting front is consistent under the open and closed air hole conditions at a certain infiltration time the barometric pressure in the vadose zone rises sharply and starts to block the wetting front transport therefore the transport position of the wetting front under the closed air hole conditions always lags behind that under the open air hole conditions and the moisture content of the vadose zone under the closed air hole conditions is more significant than under the open air hole conditions the resistivity in the vadose zone is mainly determined by the moisture content the greater the water content the smaller the resistivity it can be found that during the gas phase blocking effect is obvious the resistivity under the closed air hole conditions is always smaller than under the open air hole conditions fig 6a and 6b the increase in water infiltration intensity will lead to an increase in the advance rate of the wetting front the shortening of the critical time for the transition of the wetting front propulsion pattern and the increase in the speed of the moisture content rises in the vadose zone so that the measured resistivity values at the same level in the vadose zone gradually decrease and the magnitude of the decrease gradually increases the increase in the particle size of the medium will lead to a rise in the critical value of the infiltration intensity which will cause the critical time for the transition of the wetting front propulsion pattern to be prolonged thus the measured resistivity values at the same level in the vadose zone gradually decrease and the magnitude of the decrease gradually decreases as is shown in fig 6a and 6b for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone the difference in the laminar structure and abrupt change in the interface caused by changes in the particle size of the medium lead to a significant change in the propulsion pattern and speed of the wetting front for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 the critical time for the transition of the wetting front propulsion pattern is more significant than that of the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 while the time spent for the wetting front to reach the end point is smaller than that of the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 as a result the measured resistivity values at the same level in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 decrease more slowly than in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 as in fig 6c and 6d and the resistivity inversion results during water infiltration in the vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 λ 7 6 cm min 40 50 λ 0 7 cm min can be found in figure s1 3 3 2 response of resistivity to barometric pressure in water infiltration in the vadose zone the moisture content in the lower part of the wetting front is low at this moment the effect of the barometric pressure in the vadose zone on the resistivity can t be ignored and the resistivity change in the lower part of the wetting front is the joint effect of moisture content and barometric pressure the calculated resistivity of the vadose zone by the improved archie equation represents the effect of moisture content so the difference between the measured values and calculated values of resistivity represents the quantitative effect of barometric pressure variation on resistivity in the vadose zone in the vadose zone when the water infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value the three stages of the resistivity variation in the lower part of the wetting front corresponds to the barometric pressure variation namely the initial stabilization stage the declining stage and the sharp drop stage the wetting front reaches the resistivity monitoring point is the cause of the sharp drop in the resistivity of the vadose zone see fig 7 for the homogeneous vadose 40 50 when the water infiltration intensity is 1 5 cm min at the initial stabilization stage 0 48 s the resistivity of the vadose zone is stabilized at 419 ω m at the declining stage 48 s 212 s the barometric pressure of the vadose zone increases sharply to 2000 pa at which time a slight abrupt decrease in resistivity occurs and gradually decreases to 321 63 ω m at the sharp drop stage 212 s 260 s the wetting front reaches the resistivity monitoring point and the resistivity of the vadose zone drops sharply to 76 98 ω m due to the sharp increase in moisture content and keeps decreasing until it stabilizes around 57 ω m before the wetting front reaches the monitoring point the maximum moisture content of the monitoring position is 0 075 and the calculated resistivity value is ρ 312 62 ω m using equation 9 which differs from the background resistivity value before infiltration by δρ 106 94 ω m at the same time the difference between measured resistivity is δρ 97 37 ω m therefore δρ δρ 9 57 ω m namely the barometric pressure makes the resistivity drop by 9 57 ω m before the wetting front reaches the monitoring position when the water infiltration intensity is 7 6 cm min the resistivity change characteristics are like the above scenario for the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 and the layered heterogeneous vadose zone the difference is that for the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 the increased barometric pressure decreases the resistivity by 4 68 ω m for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 and upper 20 30 lower 40 50 the increased barometric pressure decreases the resistivity by 3 82 ω m and 6 17 ω m respectively for the homogeneous vadose zone 40 50 when the water infiltration intensity is 1 5 cm min the barometric pressure increases by about 2048 pa under the closed air hole condition when the infiltration intensity is 7 6 cm min the barometric pressure in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 increases by about 1887 pa the barometric pressure in the homogeneous vadose zone 20 30 increases by about 1589 pa and the barometric pressure in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 40 50 lower 20 30 increases by about 1408 pa the resistivity reduction values of the vadose zone corresponding to the above barometric pressure variations are 9 57 ω m 6 17 ω m 4 68 ω m and 3 82 ω m accounting for 10 90 8 77 7 73 and 6 07 of the resistivity reduction due to the moisture content change respectively the results show that there is a significant negative correlation between barometric pressure and resistivity in the vadose zone namely increased barometric pressure decreases the resistivity in the vadose zone and the more significant the increase in barometric pressure the greater the reduction in resistivity which is consistent with the previous studies chen 2013 yamasaki and arai 2008 on the other hand the contribution of increased barometric pressure to the decrease in resistivity of the vadose zone is significant with a maximum percentage of 10 90 while the barometric pressure variation caused by water infiltration in laboratory experiments is limited it can be expected that the contribution of barometric pressure to the change of resistivity will be greater when the barometric pressure variation is more significant in this paper the barometric pressure variation in the vadose zone is caused by water infiltration when the water infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value most of the pore channels above the wetting front are filled with moisture and the gas phase cannot be freely released and thus is compressed inside the vadose zone in a closed system composed of solid liquid gas phases in which the free charges move in a small range under the influence of the ert electric field the barometric pressure variation changes the number of free charges within the system which affects the resistivity within the system there is a positive correlation between the number of free charges in the system and the magnitude of the increase in barometric pressure namely the higher the barometric pressure due to the gas compression the greater the number of free charges in the cell and the lower the resistivity in the system li and oldenburg 1991 and the amplitude of resistivity change increases with barometric pressure change in addition when the barometric pressure is large enough the increased barometric pressure decreases the resistivity of the medium by improving the moisture content compressing pore structure reducing porosity and other properties of the soil medium ma et al 2016 brace and orange 1968 brace et al 1965 3 4 micro mechanism analysis of barometric pressure variation and resistivity response during water infiltration in the vadose zone in the process of water infiltration in the vadose zone significant changes in barometric pressure in the vadose zone usually require a high infiltration intensity or highly permeable homogeneous medium with strong pore connectivity which makes it easier for water to form a uniform surface infiltration and isolate the vadose zone from the atmosphere as the infiltrated water accumulates and migrates downward the gas in the vadose zone is continuously compressed the barometric pressure increases until it reaches the air breaking critical value the value is equal to the sum of soil surface head wetting front height and inlet pressure of soil water same below the gas will break through the overlying water to form an airflow channel and release it from the upper boundary berg et al 2014 haines 1930 and the water infiltration rate reaches the minimum close to zero after that the barometric pressure decreases rapidly and when it reaches the air closing critical value the airflow channel is occupied by water again and the water infiltration rate reaches the maximum at this moment wang et al 1998 grismer et al 1994 touma and vauclin 1986 peck 1965a peck 1965b when the barometric pressure in the vadose zone reaches a critical value of stability the rate of gas release is equal to the speed of water infiltration and then the barometric pressure stabilizes at this critical value and forms a continuous gas channel in the vadose zone grismer et al 1994 touma and vauclin 1986 the micro mechanism of barometric pressure change threshold during water infiltration can be better explained using the percolation theory hunt et al 2014 that is when the gas channel is entirely occupied by water during water infiltration the barometric pressure in the vadose zone cannot be released and changes abruptly from a slow rise to a sharp increase under the action of gravity and capillary forces of the infiltrated water the resistivity of the vadose zone reflects the electrical conductivity of the medium which is weighted by the structure components water saturation solute concentration and temperature of the medium in general the looser the medium structure the greater the resistivity the higher the content of clay minerals the lower the medium resistivity shevnin et al 2007 the increase in water saturation and solute concentration generally decreases the medium resistivity comina et al 2010 earon et al 2012 siddiqui and osman 2013 archie 1942 as the temperature rises at room temperature the solubility and ionization of electrolytes in the pore water will increase resulting in a decrease in medium resistivity delaney et al 2001 keller and frischknecht 1966 in contrast the water infiltration in the vadose zone is a process in which the medium is alternately saturated and unsaturated and this process causes a change in the medium resistivity on the one hand the accumulation of infiltrated water increases the moisture content causing a decrease in resistivity and this process controls the entire moisture affected zone michot et al 2003 the micro mechanism is revealed by using micro element statistical methods when the moisture content is low the distribution of water micro elements is initially disconnected and discrete as the moisture content increases the water micro elements gradually show intermittent fine line distribution when the moisture content is greater than the critical value the isolation of water micro elements is broken and multiple continuous paths are formed and the medium resistivity changes abruptly with the further increase of moisture content the water micro elements in the medium are interconnected to form a network structure and the decreasing trend of medium resistivity will slow down at this moment wang 2021 on the other hand during the increase of barometric pressure in the vadose zone the medium structure becomes denser and the gas compression increases the number of free charges per unit volume which leads to a decrease in resistivity li and oldenburg 1991 and this effect is obvious in the lower part of the wetting front in the vadose zone a conceptual diagram of the micro mechanism of barometric pressure changes and resistivity response during water infiltration in the vadose zone can be found in fig 8 4 conclusions the water infiltration in the vadose zone is a process of water gas two phase repulsion equilibrium which is influenced by various factors such as water infiltration intensity medium structure and barometric pressure this paper studied the barometric pressure variation during water infiltration in the vadose zone based on laboratory experiments and numerical simulations further study of the resistivity response to the barometric pressure variation was carried out using ert and the following conclusions were drawn the critical value of water infiltration intensity exists in the vadose zone which depends on the medium properties and structure the critical value of water infiltration intensity gradually increases as the permeability decreases and the critical infiltration intensity in the layered heterogeneous vadose zone depends on the critical value in the low permeability medium layer on the water transport path when the water infiltration intensity is less than the critical value the infiltrated water cannot wrap the gas in the vadose zone so the barometric pressure is minimal when the water infiltration intensity exceeds the critical value the barometric pressure change in the vadose zone will go through three stages slow growth sharp increase and stability with the rise of the water infiltration intensity the time taken for the slow growth and the sharp increase of barometric pressure gradually shortens in contrast the maximum value of the barometric pressure gradually increases when the water infiltration intensity is greater than the critical value with the increase of the medium s particle size the slow growth stage of the barometric pressure in the vadose zone is shortened and the rate of barometric pressure rise gradually increases for the sharp increase stage of the barometric pressure in the vadose zone the rate of barometric pressure rise gradually decreases finally the maximum value of the barometric pressure in the vadose zone gradually decreases for the layered heterogeneous vadose zone upper 20 30 lower 40 50 the higher permeability makes it easier for the gas phase to be carried by water into the lower medium making the gas phase more saturated and the volume of the compressed gas phase larger and the final barometric pressure in the vadose zone is higher the comparison between the results of laboratory experiments and the numerical simulations shows that as the particle size of the medium increases the pore scale s effect masks the particle morphology s effect making the actual medium parameters more closely match the ideal parameters in the model in water infiltration as the water infiltration intensity and the particle size of the medium increase the rate of wetting front transport gradually increases and the increased barometric pressure in the vadose zone blocks the wetting front transport the resistivity of the vadose zone is mainly affected by the moisture content and responds to barometric pressure variations in the vadose zone in the vadose zone s upper part of the wetting front the effect of moisture content variation on resistivity masks the direct response of resistivity to barometric pressure variation however barometric pressure changes the moisture content of the wetting front s upper vadose zone by affecting the wetting front s propulsion pattern and rate indirectly changing the vadose zone s resistivity in the lower part of the wetting front the response of resistivity to the barometric pressure variation is obvious due to the low moisture content when the water infiltration intensity exceeds the critical value the resistivity variation can be roughly divided into the initial stabilization stage the declining stage and the sharp drop stage corresponding to the barometric pressure variation meanwhile the relationship between the resistivity and the moisture content in the vadose zone meets the generalized archie equation and the generalized archie formula between the resistivity and the moisture content in the homogeneous medium 40 50 and the homogeneous medium 20 30 is ρ 50 97 0 34 θ 1 2 and ρ 54 32 0 32 θ 1 2 respectively the difference in resistivity between the measured values and the calculated values by the improved archie equation can be used to depict the response of resistivity to barometric pressure variation and quantify their relationship in the vadose zone the results show that the contribution of increased barometric pressure to the decrease in resistivity of the vadose zone is significant with a maximum percentage exceeding 10 90 of the moisture content contribution and the increased barometric pressure decreases the resistivity of the medium by improving the moisture content compressing pore structure decreasing porosity and other properties of the soil medium and the increase in the number of free charges per unit volume due to the gas compression is an important and most neglected
