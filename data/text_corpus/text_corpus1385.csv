6925,assessing impacts of climate change on hydrology involves global scale climate projections by general circulation models gcms downscaling of global scale projections to regional scale by statistical methods or regional climate models and then use of regional outputs in hydrological simulations hydrological simulations considers varying inputs starting with soil characteristics land cover vegetation types control structures to social parameters such as human interventions irrigation and water use this makes the model highly parametrized and at the same time highly uncertain due to the non availability of majority of input parameters here we compare the contributions of uncertainty from hydrological parameterization in the hydrological projections of climate change to that generated from the use of multiple climate models the ganga river basin in india was selected as the study region for regional climate change projections we use dynamic downscaling outputs from coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex and statistical downscaling outputs from a transfer function forced with 3 gcms institut pierre simon laplace ipsl european consortium earth system model ec earth and mpi max plank institut esm earth system model monte carlo simulations mcs are performed with 1000 generated sets of sensitive model parameters for each of the gcm regional model combination we find that the observed time series of river discharge is reproduced well but with bias in low flow conditions this is probably associated with human intervention and poor representation of baseflow in vic due to the neglected groundwater storage which feed the surface water during low flow condition the future projections show that the major uncertainty lies across climate models for all the four seasons mam jjas on and djf and for all the hydrological variables soil moisture evapotranspiration et water yield and river discharge the uncertainty resulting from the mcs is quite small as compared to the climate model uncertainty we are unable to find any added value in hydrological simulations by rigorous hydrological calibration and parameterization in absence of many required data when the forcing meteorological data has huge uncertainty our findings highlight the need of convergence of climate models before the studies on hydrological impacts assessment and subsequent development of adaptation strategies keywords climate change hydrologic impacts uncertainty parameter uncertainty hydrologic model of large basin 1 introduction the study of regional hydrologic implications of changing climate has crucial role in the management of water resources the water cycle is expected to be accelerated as a result of the increase in temperature oki and kanae 2006 the intensity frequency and duration of precipitation events are expected to change with warming kumar et al 1992 trenberth et al 2003 wild and liepert 2010 evapotranspiration soil moisture and runoff are highly sensitive to even small changes in temperature and precipitation chattopadhyay and hulme 1997 milly et al 2005 seneviratne et al 2010 gcms provide the information about the future climate by simulating time series of climate variables with greenhouse gas effect over the atmosphere prudhomme et al 2003 however gcms are at very coarse resolution and for regional climate change impact studies it has to be brought to finer scale by downscaling regional hydroclimatic modelling hence involves the following steps simulating the future climate variables using gcms downscaling the outputs to basin scale and using this as forcing to hydrological models for assessing hydrological impacts of climate change a number of hydrological models based on water and energy balances have been developed in the recent past for this purpose arnell 1999 döll et al 2003 gleick 1986 liang et al 1996 1994 vorosmarty and moore 1991 numerous attempts have been made to understand the land surface hydrologic responses to climate change using the macroscale hydrological models for specific geographic locations christensen et al 2004 hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 lettenmaier and gan 1990 including indian river basins singh and kumar 1997 gosain et al 2006 raje et al 2014 the impact assessment however is associated with uncertainties that are involved in each step of hydroclimatic modeling i e uncertainty in gcm projections downscaling uncertainty and hydrological parameter uncertainty leavesley 1994 xu 1999 representing these uncertainties in climate change impact studies is equally important and at the same time considering all its sources concurrently is challenging multiple number of gcms have been developed with different algorithms for land atmosphere ocean interactions hence giving different outputs therefore the projected hydrological variables are highly dependent on the gcms employed in the study these uncertainties are assessed with the use of information from multiple gcms e g allen et al 2000 lee and kim 2013 new and hulme 2000 simonovic et al 2003 simonovic and li 2004 tebaldi et al 2005 some of the approaches to address the uncertainty across climate models include non parametric approach ghosh and mujumdar 2007 possibilistic approach mujumdar and ghosh 2008 imprecise probability ghosh and mujumdar 2009 analysis of variance hingray et al 2014 yip et al 2011 square root error variance woldemeskel et al 2016 2014 etc the above studies provide an interpretation of uncertainties limiting to that arising due to gcms and not focusing on the other aspects of it downscaling techniques can be broadly classified to statistical and dynamical downscaling in statistical downscaling a data driven relationship is derived between the predictors gcm simulated climate variable and predictands regional scale variable e g conway and jones 1998 chen et al 2010 groppelli et al 2011 jeong et al 2012 osca et al 2013 kannan and ghosh 2013 salvi et al 2013 sachindra et al 2013 santos et al 2016 dynamic downscaling makes use of regional climate models rcms e g jones et al 1995 dobler and ahrens 2010 2011 krishna kumar et al 2011 liu et al 2013 dosio et al 2015 scinocca et al 2016 though both the methods have their own advantages and limitations the assumptions involved in it adds to the uncertainty fowler et al 2007 the uncertainty arising due to the use of different methods of statistical downscaling have been modelled in the recent past ghosh and katkar 2012 gutmann et al 2014 hu et al 2013 khan et al 2006 samadi et al 2013 the uncertainty resulting from the use of different observed data used for model calibration in statistical downscaling was studied by kannan et al 2014 the assessment of different dynamical downscaling methods im et al 2010 kumar et al 2013 mishra 2015 singh et al 2016 and inter comparison of statistical and dynamical downscaling techniques chen et al 2011a flaounas et al 2013 vaittinada ayar et al 2016 were also performed in various studies it can be inferred from the above studies that a major portion of uncertainty is explained by the choice of downscaling method along with the selection of gcms hydrological models on the other hand are highly parametrized some of which are heterogeneous in space and time or cannot be measured a number of calibration techniques have been developed which uses observed data as a reference to obtain the approximate value of these parameters moradkhani and sorooshian 2009 troy et al 2008 yapo et al 1996 difficulty in obtaining unique set of parameters lack of accurate observed data etc lead to parameter uncertainty in hydrological models uncertainty assessment in hydroclimatic simulations involving hydrological models have become recent research trend wilby and harris 2006 proposed a probabilistic framework considering ensemble of 4 gcms 2 scenarios 2 downscaling techniques 2 hydrological model structures and 2 sets of hydrological model parameters for assessing the uncertainty in climate change impacts on low flow scenario of river thames uk use of multiple hydrological models is also observed in multiple studies to assess the uncertainty teng et al 2012 velázquez et al 2013 various techniques like multi objective calibration approach ruelland et al 2015 generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation beven and binley 1992 bayesian model averaging bastola et al 2011 technique were utilized for uncertainty assessment raje and krishnan 2012 used the bayesian approach implemented by markov chain monte carlo method to assess the uncertainty in vic model under hydroclimatic studies for indian river basins extensive amount of research has been carried out for the uncertainty assessment of hydrological impacts of climate change by the consideration of multiple gcms downscaling techniques hydrological models and parameters e g jiang et al 2007 bastola et al 2011 chen et al 2011b bae et al 2011 chen et al 2012 bosshard et al 2013 apart from the uncertainty assessment few studies aim at evaluating the extent to which the climate change adaptation strategies are affected by uncertainty refsgaard et al 2013 and possible ways of reducing it raje and mujumdar 2009 refsgaard et al 2016 previous uncertainty assessment studies have been summarized in table 1 as observed in the table previous studies largely performed hydrologic model calibration based on observed streamflow data and used the same to understand hydrologic model parameter uncertainty they have used either statistical or dynamic downscaling or a simple bias correction without downscaling though there have been a consistent finding that gcm uncertainty dominates global and regional hydrological cycle has been significantly affected by human interventions jaramillo and destouni 2015 such as irrigation reservoir operation ground water pumping and majority of the available land surface models lsms are unable to simulate all of them together haddeland et al 2006a 2006b leng et al 2014 rosenberg et al 2013 furthermore there is often non availability of data pertaining to the same hence the hydrologic model calibration for indian case studies is extremely difficult and often erroneous because models can not consider the water regulation due to non availability of data models without accounting for water regulation consider observed flows for calibration but these flows are regulated flows in india hence such a calibration may capture the streamflow but for a wrong reason e g döll et al 2008 raje et al 2014 syed et al 2014 chawla and mujumdar 2015 the other set of studies use the recommended values of parameters without a specific calibration mishra et al 2010 and they have been criticized to misrepresent the hydrological system with uncalibrated parameters though not tested through a proper framework rather than going for an erroneous model calibration due to lack of available data the hydrologic model parameters were allowed to consider any possible value this allows maximum possible uncertainty due to parameterization which is of much higher magnitude than any other estimation of uncertainty incorporating calibration even such an uncertainty remains insignificant with respect to the climate model uncertainty and this raises a very important question on the readiness of using such uncertain projections for climate change adaptation this specific science question has not been addressed in any of the available literature for large river basins in south asia further to this the analysis was not limited just with streamflow as the majority of available streamflow data are regulated but considered other variables such as soil moisture and et to understand the complete picture of changing water cycle unlike other studies we have not considered only a single suit of downscaling rather considered both statistical and dynamic downscaling to present the complete picture of uncertainty this analysis is an advancement with respect to other studies in terms of i consideration of complete uncertainty from multiple gcms and downscaling methods ii assessing multiple hydrologic variables to understand changing pattern of the water cycle iii allowing maximum possible uncertainty in hydrologic parameterization to show the significance of climate model uncertainty and finally iv checking the adequacy and preparedness of climate models to be used in hydrologic impacts assessment here we address the science question on the impacts of hydrological parameter uncertainty in the background of gcm and downscaling uncertainty we attempt to compare and understand the contribution of uncertainty from climate models and hydrologic parameterization to the hydroclimatic projections with a case study application of ganga river basin india the variable infiltration capacity vic model which is a semi distributed macroscale hydrological model is implemented for this purpose the major objectives of the study are i to assess the uncertainty in hydrologic impacts of climate change over ganga basin in the context of gcm uncertainty downscaling uncertainty and parameter uncertainty ii to render the spread of climate induced changes in output variables streamflow et soil moisture and water yield from all the possible values of the uncertain parameters in vic model and compare it with gcm and downscaling uncertainty we use mcs with the vic model considering the sensitive parameters to be uncertain selection of sensitive parameters is performed based on earlier studies demaria et al 2007 we assume that soil parameters follow triangular distribution muleta and nicklow 2005 where the mode is the recommended value of the parameters and the base of the triangles are the possible ranges the vegetation parameters are considered to follow uniform distribution within a range of 0 1 times the prescribed value since the ranges were unknown random numbers are generated for each of the parameters using these distributions and ranges the dynamic downscaled cordex and statistical downscaled transfer function outputs of 3 gcms ipsl ec earth and mpi esm are used as meteorological forcings for each of the gcm downscaling combination mcs are performed for the vic model using 1000 generated sets of parameters the results are compared for the assessment of uncertainty the following section presents the details of data and methodology used 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area the ganga basin located within the geographical coordinates of 73⁰30 e to 89⁰0 e latitude and 22⁰30 n to 31⁰30 n longitude extends over india nepal and bangladesh and covers an area of 1086000 km2 in india it extends over an area of 861404 km2 fig 1 a and receives an annual average rainfall of 110 cm the monsoon months are from june to september with rainfall spatially varying from 39 to 200 cm nrcd moef 2009 the ganga river is snow fed and hence maintains a moderate level of streamflow throughout the year with maximum discharge during the monsoon months causing flood in the plains the ganga basin is characterised by large variation in altitude ranging from 7000 m at the himalayan mountains to 50 m in the gangetic plain it is the largest and most cultivated basin in the country with dense population the land use land cover over the region is shown in fig 1 b there is an increase in the water demand for the last few decades to meet the needs of growing population posing a stress to surface water and groundwater hence making the climate change studies inevitable for this basin 2 2 regional climate model simulations the dynamically and statistically downscaled output of 3 gcms ipsl ec earth and mpi esm are considered for climate change projections the cordex simulations are used as dynamic downscaling output where rcms were forced with lateral boundaries from global ipsl ec earth and mpi esm and run at a resolution of 50 km over the cordex south asian domain the regional models used for downscaling are regional climatic model version 4 regcm4 for ipsl rossby centre regional atmospheric model version 4 rca4 for ec earth singh et al 2016 and remo regional model 2009 for mpi esm the output of these runs were acquired from the cordex south asia group http cccr tropmet res in home index jsp at daily scale the representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 emission scenario which is a midrange scenario taylor et al 2012 is considered the choice of the gcm was based on the availability of their output among the cordex regional simulations for south asia provided by centre for climate change research cccr only ipsl ec earth and mpi have surface wind speed data for historical as well as future rcp 45 time period we use both the simulations for historical period 1979 2005 and future period 2011 2037 the rcm simulated climate variables may have realistic spatial patterns but have bias from the observed value and need to be corrected here we perform the same by quantile based bias correction method developed by li et al 2010 the observed data used as reference is indian meteorological department imd gridded data products of precipitation rajeevan et al 2006 rajeevan and bhate 2009 and temperature srivastava et al 2009 imd had rainfall observations at 6076 stations for varying time intervals the dataset was developed using about 3500 rain gauge stations on an average for daily analysis statistical downscaling method includes the development of an empirical relationship between the predictors gcm simulated climate variable and the predictands regional scale variable it can be broadly classified into three weather generators weather typing and transfer functions the weather type models are observed to fail in terms of simulating the spatial variability of the daily precipitation conway and jones 1998 although the weather generator models such as conditional random field by raje and mujumdar 2009 overcome the above drawback of weather typing method they still fail to simulate the mean condition and spatial cross correlations across stations in a given region it also demands large number of parameters and computational expense the downscaling model used in the present study involves the use of kernel regression coupled with classification and regression tree cart developed by kannan and ghosh 2013 and salvi et al 2013 the main strengths of this method over other available downscaling technique are its ability to capture the cross correlation between the stations and to project the mean rainfall with high accuracy salvi et al 2013 have shown that the orography is also captured well by the model hence performing better in simulating the monsoon in comparison to other downscaling models as the first step the variables that directly affect the rainfall processes are selected as the predictors temperature pressure specific humidity u wind and v wind at surface and 500 hpa pressure level are used as predictors in the present case the bias in these predictor variables are corrected with respect to the reanalysis data by national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar using quantile based mapping technique li et al 2010 the bias corrected data is characterised by multidimensionality and multicollinearity which has to be reduced before using it for statistical downscaling in order to reduce the number of dimensions with minimum decrease in the variability of data principal component analysis pca is applied to the bias corrected predictor variables to obtain the principal components the next step is to classify the days based on the spatial pattern of rainfall in the zone of interest and we use k means clustering as adopted by kannan and ghosh 2013 the relationship between the principal components and the rainfall states for the observed period is derived using classification and regression tree cart which is a decision tree learning technique using the developed relationship and the future principal components from bias corrected gcm simulations we obtain the rainfall state for the future time period in order to project the future rainfall from future states the kernel regression technique is utilized the kernel regression is a non parametric technique and can be used to estimate the conditional probability of a random variable the developed kernel regression in applied to the predictors and derived stated from bias corrected gcm simulations to obtain the daily rainfall projections for temperature we use direct bias correction techniques and they are more reliable and smoother as compared to rainfall hughes et al 1993 2 3 hydrological simulations with variable infiltration capacity model vic model is a semi distributed macroscale hydrological model in which the water and energy balance equations are solved grid wise liang et al 1994 the sub grid heterogeneity in vegetation is considered by dividing each grid into smaller tiles based on the land cover vic also considers variation in the soil moisture capacity at subgrid level non linear recession of baseflow and topography that accounts to orographic precipitation and temperature lapse rate multiple layers of soil can be considered in vic but generally it is taken as 3 with first 2 layers showing dynamic response to the infiltrated rainfall and the third layer showing seasonal variation of soil moisture the runoff occurs from the bottom layer according to arno model please refer liang et al 1994 for furtur details the upward movement of moisture is transported by evapotranspiration through the roots of the vegetation the evapotranspiration is calculated using penman monteith equation considering it as a function of vapour pressure deficit and net radiation the interception of rainfall by the canopy is calculated as a function of lai the soil properties are considered to be same throughout each grid cell the model can be run in either water balance or energy balance at daily or sub daily time step once the energy balance and water balance are computed routing model lohmann et al 1998 is employed to calculate the streamflow using the runoff and baseflow from each grid snow module can be kept active to account for snowmelt energy balance approach is used to represent the snow accumulation and ablation according to andreadis et al 2009 based on the total capacity of snow the water holding capacity is defined and the newly intercepted water is calculated with respect to it the excess of water holding capacity will be the snowmelt the inputs for vic model includes meteorological data precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature and wind soil properties land use vegetation properties and topographical details the parameters in the model are listed in table 2 vic has been extensively used for climate change and land use change impact studies drought assessment hydrological forecasting etc chawla and mujumdar 2015 haddeland et al 2006b mishra et al 2010 nijssen et al 2001a b nijssen et al 1997 the vic model includes certain parameters which cannot be measured in situ since they are extremely heterogeneous in nature or they are not physically observable these parameters are usually calibrated by minimising the difference between simulated and observed data few of the calibration parameters are i dsmax mm day it is the maximum velocity of the baseflow for the lowest layer of soil and it can vary between 0 and 30 depending on hydraulic conductivity it is calculated by multiplying the slope of the grid cell with saturated hydraulic conductivity ii ds fraction it is the fraction of dsmax where non linear baseflow occurs it varies in the range of 0 1 and an initial value of 0 001 can be assumed with high ds in the bottom soil layer and with lower water content the baseflow is high the baseflow parameter is highly sensitive in basins with snow accumulation and snow melt raje and krishnan 2012 iii ws fraction it is the maximum soil moisture at the lowest layer where non linear baseflow occurs and is analogous to ds the runoff peaks get delayed with higher value of ws since the water content will be raised with rapidly increasing the non linear baseflow its value is in the range of 0 1 generally greater than 0 5 iv binf it denotes the shape of the variable infiltration capacity curve the available infiltration capacity is linked to the relative saturated grid cell area by this parameter it varies between 0 and 0 4 high value of binf leads to high infiltration and low surface runoff the partitioning of rainfall snowmelt to direct runoff and infiltration is hence controlled by this parameter v soil depth m the soil depth of second and the third layers are considered for calibration and they are in the range of 0 1 1 5 m as the soil depth increases the seasonal peak flows get delayed and the evapotranspiration increases in the present study apart from the soil parameters few of the vegetation parameters were also considered to be sensitive leaf area index lai rooting depth vegetation roughness length and vegetation displacement height are regarded to be uncertain following a uniform distribution 2 3 1 data used in vic the topographic details are derived from digital elevation map dem from u s geological survey usgs hydro1k dataset at 1 km resolution https lta cr usgs gov hydro1k raje et al 2014 the land use land cover lulc data are acquired from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr available at the website of university of maryland at a spatial resolution of 1 km hansen et al 2000 raje et al 2014 the values of soil parameters were directly procured from the 0 5 global input parameter available at the vic model website the soil file is the interpolated version of the 2 degree global file developed by nijssen et al 2001a b which was prepared using soil map by food and agricultural organisation 1995 the sub sampling was carried using nearest neighbourhood approach the metrological data required for running the vic model are rainfall air temperature extremes and wind speed the observed precipitation and temperature data are obtained from the imd and wind speed data from climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr all these data are brought to a grid resolution of 0 5 at which the model is implemented the observed streamflow at monthly scales for two stations bhimagodha and ankinghat are obtained from the cwc for validation of the simulated discharge the regulated flow is converted to naturalized flow by incorporating the data pertaining to the water control diversion structure in the upstream of the ankinghat gauge station water is diverted from the main ganga river by diversion structures viz upper ganga canal east ganga canal madhya ganga canal east ganga canal and lower ganga canal the data corresponding to the canals were obtained from the cwc and added to the monthly discharge at ankinghat gauge station in order to convert the regulated streamflow to naturalised streamflow the same methodology was also used in chawla and mujumdar 2015 for further understanding an example of monthly discharge calculation for the year 2000 is given table s1 the satellite based soil moisture data used for validation is a merged product from european space agency climate change initiative esa cci which is at a spatial resolution of 0 25 and temporal resolution of daily scale for the period of 1978 2005 the simulated et is validated using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mod16 global terrestrial evapotranspiration data set which is at monthly time scale and at a spatial resolution of 1 km it is available for a period of 2000 2010 the in situ soil moisture for two stations viz krn and klni at a 7 day interval during the monsoon season was procured from imd 2 4 monte carlo simulations mcs is a method of translating the uncertainty in the model inputs parameters to the model output probability distributions for the inputs parameters are assumed and random samples are generated which are utilized to execute the model complex systems can be easily described through mcs even though being computationally very expensive and time consuming monte carlo method has a wide variety of application including sensitivity analysis of hydrological models and uncertainty assessments demaria et al 2007 used the monte carlo approach to study the sensitivity and identifiability of parameters controlling surface and sub surface flow wilby 2005 used the monte carlo sampling approach in the historic climate variability context to understand parameters stability and identifiability mcs to represent uncertainties were also used by new and hulme 2000 and prudhomme et al 2002 in our study we assume that the sensitive soil parameters described in section 2 3 1 to follow triangular distribution with base being the prescribed range and mode being the recommended value http www hydro washington edu lettenmaier models vic datasets datasets shtml the vegetation parameters are assumed to follow uniform distribution with a range of 0 1 times the prescribed value the reason for choosing a range of 0 1 times the prescribed value is completely arbitrary and is one of the drawback of present study assuming these distributions 1000 random numbers are generated for each of these sensitive parameters and the model is executed considering these set of generated parameters these simulations are first performed for the observed period to evaluate the performance of the model for climate projections we executed these simulations for 4 sets of meteorological forcings which include statistically and dynamically downscaled products of 2 gcms ipsl and ec earth the results and interpretations of the simulations using monte carlo method are described in the following section 3 results and discussions 3 1 model performance the discharge data procured from central water commission cwc for the two stations ankinghat and bhimagodha are for a period of 1977 2009 and 1990 2011 respectively further to this the modis et data covers a time period of 2000 2010 hence a common period of 10 years i e 2000 2009 was selected for validation and the results are shown in fig 2 river routing is performed for the two stations bhimagodha and ankinghat which are located in the upper ganga basin as shown in fig 1a time series of monthly discharge as obtained from the observed data and from simulations performed 1000 times under the monte carlo scheme at these two stations are presented in fig 2 a and b for the simulated discharge the band shows the uncertainty range and line shows the observed time series the pattern of the observed discharge especially the rising and the recession limbs are well captured by the simulations although the peaks do not match at bhimagodha station the error in modelling the extreme precipitation is a possible reason for the discrepancies in simulated peaks of streamflow here the fact to be highlighted is that the basin under consideration is highly human intervened and the observed streamflow is controlled by reservoirs and dams we also find negative bias in the low flow conditions which attributes to the groundwater contributions to the baseflow which is not considered in vic chawla and mujumdar 2015 the surface fluxes are greatly influenced by the groundwater interactions with an exception in case of arid regions where the groundwater can be disconnected rosenberg et al 2013 the groundwater gets recharged during the wetter periods and contributes to the streamflow during the drier periods in the indian scenario during the low flow period november to may groundwater is the key supplier to streamflow chawla and mujumdar 2015 since the groundwater interactions are not considered the model fails in reproducing the streamflow during the low flow conditions moreover same mismatches were observed in the study by chawla and mujumdar 2015 the simulated soil moisture was compared with the in situ soil moisture available from imd for 7 day interval during monsoon season in fig 2 c and d the band shows the range of simulated soil moisture and the line represents the observed soil moisture both at a depth of 30 cm during june september 2005 for two stations viz krl and klni the pattern of the soil moisture is well captured by the model at the both stations the performance of the hydrological simulations is also evaluated with the correlation coefficients between observed and simulated soil moisture and evapotranspiration the observed and simulated values show good correlation with coefficients in the range of 0 7 0 9 during the monsoon and post monsoon season for both soil moisture and et fig 2 f g j and k the poor correlation coefficients in the other two seasons probably attribute to the non consideration of ground water contribution fig 2 e h i and l the groundwater dynamics influences the soil moisture which in due course affects the water and energy fluxes between land and atmosphere fan et al 2007 the coupling of vic with groundwater model by liang 2003 resulted in drier soil moisture in the top layers and lesser evapotranspiration in comparison to default vic thus the non consideration of groundwater in the model contributes to the bias in estimated soil moisture and evapotranspiration we have calculated the model performance statistics nash sutcliffe efficiency nse correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and refined index of agreement dr willmott et al 2012 considering river discharge soil moisture and et for each of the simulations and depicted the extreme cases in table 3 we find that when nse shows lowest value for streamflow its performance is better for other variables as compared to that corresponding to highest nse of streamflow this necessitates the use of all hydrologic variables rather than focussing only on streamflow this further explains the reason behind non removal of any of the simulations from uncertainty estimation further to this the non regulated streamflow is only available for upper ganga basin hence we cannot calibrate the model for entire ganges with the same data considering these facts we allow the model parameters to freely take any values to get a better picture of uncertainty a considerable area of the basin is cropland with intensive irrigation fig 1 b hence the other reason behind poor correlation could be the non consideration of irrigation in vic model the seasonal mean of the vic simulated evapotranspiration also shows good resemblance with modis et in all seasons except monsoon fig 3 a h during the monsoon season there is a high discrepancy between the simulated and modis et it should be noted that the cloud cover is very high during monsoon and that may lead to an erroneous et data from satellite the modis products the mismatch may attribute to the quality of observed remote sensing datasets we find a good resemblance in the shape of climatological et between modis and simulated data though the simulated data overestimates the same fig 3i for further investigation we plot et from cfsr interim ecmwf re analysis era interim and modern era retrospective analysis merra and find a consistent underestimation of et by modis inaccuracies in the et from modis due to over or underestimation has been reported in other studies kim et al 2012 ramoelo et al 2014 the satellite observed soil moisture data acquired from esa cci covers a depth of 0 5 2 cm the depth of the top layer in our model is 0 3 m and hence comparing it with satellite soil moisture will have its own limitations we have made the assumption that the soil moisture is uniformly distributed over the top layer and calculated the soil moisture at a depth of 2 cm for the purpose of calculating the correlation coefficient the resampling of the data to the spatial resolution of the model was done using the method of bilinear interpolation the spatial plots of mean observed and simulated soil moisture following the same methodology is plotted for all the four seasons of the year fig 4 it is observed that the spatial pattern soil moisture is captured well by the model for different seasons but with non uniform biases 3 2 future projections the spatial pattern of the mean of accumulated precipitation over various seasons for each gcm downscaling combination with that of imd observed data is compared in fig 5 it can be observed that the overall spatial pattern is captured well by the downscaled models with a few exceptions all the models perform well during monsoon and winter season however during the pre monsoon and post monsoon ec earth cordex and ipsl cordex output tend to overestimate precipitation over the upper and middle reaches of the basin small changes in temperature or precipitation can cause an amplified impact on the components of water cycle milly et al 2005 therefore we compare the spatial pattern of seasonal changes in precipitation and temperature from each of the gcm downscaling combination in figs 6 and 7 respectively ec earth cordex ipsl cordex and mpi cordex represent the dynamic downscaled output of ec earth ipsl and mpi respectively whereas ec earth sd ipsl sd and mpi sd represents the corresponding statistical downscaled product each row in fig 6 represents mean of changes in precipitation between the periods of 2011 2037 and 1979 2005 for each of the seasons pre monsoon mam monsoon jjas post monsoon on and winter djf and columns indicate different gcm downscaling combinations similar sequence is followed for maximum and minimum temperature in fig 7 during the pre monsoon all the projections except that corresponding to ipsl show moderate increase in precipitation over most of the regions few regions are observed to have no change in the projected precipitation in the lower ganga basin very high increment of pre monsoon precipitation can be observed for ec earth cordex ipsl cordex and mpi sd we observe a decline in precipitation in the upper and middle ganga for ipsl cordex during the monsoon season we find a mild to moderate increase in precipitation at most of the places in the basin except in case of mpi products a decline in precipitation can be observed in upper ganga basin for mpi cordex and mpi sd the decline being more pronounced in case of the latter however there is a high increase in monsoon precipitation in the middle and lower reaches of the basin for mpi sd simulation ec earth cordex and ec earth sd show an increase in precipitation during the post monsoon season ipsl cordex and mpi sd show exactly opposite change the six simulations provide six entirely different precipitation scenarios of winter precipitation it is important to note that for other seasons there is occasional agreement in large scale trends however the spatial patterns are almost entirely different across different model runs for all the seasons similarly the maximum temperature also shows variations in the spatial pattern for each season all the projections for maximum temperature show increase the magnitude being more for ipsl sd mpi cordex and mpi sd 1 2 1 6 during winter ec earth cordex mpi cordex and mpi sd show very high increase in maximum temperature similar results are obtained for minimum temperature ec earth sd and mpi sd showing maximum increase during the post monsoon and winter respectively it can be noted that during monsoon season the projections of maximum temperature from multiple gcm downscaling combinations have higher agreements overall it is evident that there are high discrepancies across gcms and downscaling models for the precipitation and temperature projections during all the seasons we also plotted the trends in the precipitation maximum and minimum temperature in the figs 8 10 respectively in fig 8a the trend across the 3 gcms are considered with the band representing the uncertainty due to downscaling the precipitation trend across different downscaling techniques statistical and dynamical downscaling is represented in fig 8b the band depicting the uncertainty across gcms in fig 8c the trend in precipitation across the 3 gcms and 2 downscaling techniques is shown in general the future precipitation is observed to decrease the peaks in the precipitation is sharper for the future scenarios the maximum and minimum temperatures show increasing trend in future figs 9 and 10 as expected the uncertainty due to the downscaling technique is less as compared to the gcm uncertainty the uncertainty arising from multiple gcms when they are used in statistical downscaling is explained by calculating the partial correlation of the predictors involved in statistical downscaling with respect to the predictands for all the gcms table 4 it can be observed that the values of the partial correlation has wide range of variation among the gcms during all seasons with inconsistencies even in signs the surface humidity shows a positive correlation for all the gcms during the past and future the values have a wide range across gcms with negative values during some of the seasons and this results into uncertainty in the projections of precipitation similarly the sea level pressure shows a wide variation in the correlation values even though it is mostly negative during the past the partial correlation value for temperature at 500 hpa are not consistent even with the signs similar is the case with surface u wind and v wind at 500 hpa during both past and future the other predictors also show a wide variations in the partial correlation from the above observations it can be concluded that the relation between predictors and predictand is different across different gcms even when the same downscaling is applied and this results into very high uncertainty in the projections 3 3 uncertainty in hydrologic projection hydrologic modeling is performed with vic for the historical simulations and future projections using the meteorological data as obtained for different gcms and downscaling combinations mcs are performed to assess the uncertainty in river discharge the simulated changes in discharge for future 2011 2037 with respect to the past 1979 2005 corresponding to each of the 1000 sets of simulations during each season are represented in fig 11 with the help of box plots each of the box plot corresponds to the output for the six meteorological forcing sets the width of each of the box plots denotes the spread of the projected changes resulting from 1000 simulations corresponding to a specific gcm downscaling combination and hence it quantifies the hydrologic parameter uncertainty the differences between two box plots show the climate model uncertainty from fig 11 it is clearly visible that the range of variation in discharge due to parameter uncertainty is very less when compared to the climate model uncertainty the width of box plots for all the cases look almost insignificant as compared to the differences in positions between the boxes there is also no overlap between the boxes showing very high uncertainty resulting from the use of multiple climate models for all the seasons for example during the pre monsoon season where the dynamic downscaled product of all the three gcms show decrease in the streamflow the statistical downscaled products show increase in the same the differences across models are not just in terms of values but also in terms of the signs in changes such a huge uncertainty provides very little confidence to the policy makers to use the projections for water management in adapting to climate change if we consider the individual simulation the changes in precipitation and temperature are reflected well in the simulated streamflow at the two stations for the pre monsoon season the impacts of increase in the precipitation is prominent in the streamflow for ipsl sd and mpi sd streamflow corresponding to all the cordex simulations show prominent decrease which is attributed to the decline in precipitation in monsoon season there is an overall increase in streamflow for ankinghat in exception to that corresponding to both the mpi products which is very similar to the changes in precipitation in the upper to middle ganga basin on the other hand at bhimagodha the simulated streamflow from ipsl sd and mpi cordex show a decline due to reduced precipitation as well as increase in temperature at the upper reaches of the basin during the post monsoon and winter season the pattern of changes in the streamflow is clearly driven by precipitation we observe that the simulated streamflow from ec earth sd has the maximum increase and that from ipsl cordex shows a decrease which is analogous to their corresponding precipitation pattern also large differences in changes in simulated river discharge across the statistical and dynamically downscaled data is observed that can be attributed to the difference in the projected precipitation the changes in discharge for ec earth during the post monsoon and winter show huge differences between the statistical and dynamically downscaled data which is analogous to the precipitation pattern during the post monsoon season upper reaches of the ganga basin show an increase in precipitation of more than 50 mm for ec earth sd on the other hand precipitation increase corresponding to ec earth cordex is in the range of 10 30 mm with a few grids showing an increase of 50 mm winter precipitation is also found to have large uncertainty across the ec earth cordex and ec earth sd 30 mm and 50 mm respectively hence it can be concluded that the huge difference in precipitation is the reason for the differences in the river discharge we further demonstrate and compare the uncertainties in terms of the probability density functions pdfs of hydrologic variables representing their spatial variability across the basin the spatial pdfs for the changes in evapotranspiration and soil moisture are shown in fig 12 with the band representing the parameter uncertainty and different colors showing the 6 gcm downscaling combinations the widths of the bands are very less when we compare them with the differences between the pdfs of different colors this further strengthens our conclusion that the parameter uncertainty is less compared to multi climate model uncertainty we also observe that the width of the band of pdf presenting the projected changes in et during monsoon is less than that of soil moisture the parameters like ds dsmax and ws are involved in the non linear formulation of the baseflow at the time of its rapid generation during extreme wet condition raje et al 2014 hence they are more sensitive to the soil moisture during the same season resulting an increase in uncertainty associated with their parameterization similarly the parameters sensitive to evapotranspiration vegetation parameters are activated during the dry season due to the limited supply of moisture to the plants fig 13 represents box plots for changes in the total water yield i e sum of baseflow and runoff ghosh et al 2016 for future 2011 2037 with respect to the past 1979 2005 averaged over each of the four seasons plotted separately for upper middle as well as lower ganga basin koshal 2014 the spread of the projected changes resulting from 1000 simulations corresponding to a specific gcm downscaling combination is represented by the width of each box plot similar to fig 11 it is observed in fig 13 that the width of box plot representing the hydrological parameter uncertainty is very less compared to the distance in positions between the boxes and this further supports the inference from the previous figures the water yield corresponding to ec earth cordex shows a decrease during pre monsoon season over the upper and middle ganga basin during monsoon and post monsoon we observe increase in water yield for all the regions of the basin however during the winter season decreased water yields are projected for upper and middle ganga basin for the simulations from ec earth sd during the pre monsoon season decreased water yield is projected for upper ganga increased water yield is projected for middle ganga and no change is observed for lower ganga basin during other seasons increased water yields are projected over all the regions of the basin the water yield corresponding to ipsl cordex is projected to increase during the pre monsoon and monsoon season for upper and lower ganga basin there is a widespread decrease in the water yield for ipsl cordex during the post monsoon and winter season over the upper and middle ganga basin the water yield corresponding to ipsl sd is projected to increase over all the regions during the all the seasons except post monsoon where there is a slight decrement in lower ganga basin an increment in the water yield is observed during the pre monsoon season for mpi cordex over all the three regions however during the monsoon season there is a decline in water yield over the basin other than lower ganga basin we can observe a mild increase in the water yield for upper and lower ganga basin during post monsoon season in the middle ganga basin on the other hand the water yield shows negligible change during winter there is widespread increment of water yield except over the lower ganga basin the water yield is projected to increase over all the three reaches of the basin throughout all the seasons for mpi sd similar to fig 11 changes in temperature and precipitation are clearly exhibited by the changes in water yield fig 13 the results are presented separately for upper middle and lower ganga basins a upper ganga basin in the upper ganga basin which is a hilly region the changes in water yield is dependent on both precipitation and temperature the snowmelt contributes significantly to the water yield at the grids with higher altitude especially during the pre monsoon season and hence temperature plays a vital role over those grids during the pre monsoon season ec earth cordex shows a decline in water yield which is possibly due to the reduction in the precipitation in that region the water yield corresponding to ec earth sd is observed to have a mild decline which is attributed to the nearly negligible precipitation change the water yields as simulated by vic with meteorological inputs from ipsl cordex ipsl sd mpi cordex and mpi sd show an increase with ipsl sd and mpi cordex being slightly higher during the monsoon season the water yield as projected for all the regions with all the combinations except mpi cordex show an increase with higher increment for ec earth cordex and ipsl cordex over upper ganga basin similar pattern is observed for the changes in precipitation during the post monsoon season an increase in water yield is generally observed except for ipsl cordex simulations which is directly related to the changes in precipitation the maximum increase in water yield is observed for simulations forced with ec earth sd which is similar to the changing precipitation pattern during winter it can be observed that the water yield simulated with ec earth cordex and ipsl cordex outputs show decrease whereas the simulations using all the other gcm downscaling combinations show increase the maximum increase in precipitation is projected for ec earth sd and maximum decrease is for ipsl cordex which is well reflected on the changes in water yield the reduced precipitation projected by ec earth cordex in upper reaches may be the reason for decreased water yield b middle ganga basin as observed in upper ganga basin changes in precipitation is the major driving factor for variations in the water yield in the middle ganga basin with a few exceptions during pre monsoon season the water yield simulated with ec earth cordex and ipsl cordex shows a reduction which is attributed to the corresponding decrease in precipitation the projected precipitation from all other gcm downscaling combination show increase which is reflected in the water yield changes an overall increase in monsoon water yield can be observed in the middle ganga basin except for the simulation corresponding to mpi cordex which is attributed to the precipitation changes besides it can be noted that the maximum increase in precipitation is observed for mpi sd which is reflected in the water yield changes during the post monsoon season the pattern of changes in water yield is analogous to the monsoon season with an exception of ipsl cordex simulated water yield the changes in the precipitation is the major driving factor for this pattern the water yield simulated using ipsl sd meteorological data depicts a marginal increase following the corresponding pattern of changes in precipitation which include grids with mild increase decrease the reduced precipitation for ipsl cordex is captured well by the decline in corresponding simulated water yield during the winter season we observe that changes in water yield is highly dependent on the variations in precipitation the water yield simulated with ec earth cordex indicates a decrement which is probably due to decreased precipitation and the projected increase in temperature causing more evaporation c lower ganga basin in lower ganga there is an interplay between the changes in precipitation and temperature during pre monsoon season ec earth cordex shows an increase in water yield which is possibly due to the increment in precipitation water yield for ec earth sd shows no change even though there is an increase in precipitation this could be due to the slight increase in temperature since the lower ganga is mostly flat terrain the water yield is highly dependent on temperature and subsequently on evapotranspiration water yields simulated with the outputs of both downscaled products of mpi and ipsl show increase ipsl cordex being greater during the pre monsoon season similar pattern can be noticed in projected precipitation as well during the monsoon season increments in the simulated water yield attribute to increase in precipitation during post monsoon season the increase in precipitation is reflected in the increased water yield for ec earth products the projected precipitation during post monsoon by ipsl cordex and ipsl sd shows mild increase and decrease at various regions the water yield corresponding to ipsl cordex shows mild increase and ipsl sd has no change which are clearly due to the pattern of changes in precipitation during winter season the slight increase in the rainfall for ec earth cordex is well reflected in the changes of water yield in case of ec earth sd and ipsl cordex the changes in precipitation has more influence on the changes in water yield it is also evident that increase in winter precipitation in mpi sd is the cause of increase in the water yield the simulated water yield and projected precipitation for ec earth sd is observed to have maximum increment for all the sub basins the multi climate model uncertainty dominates over the hydrological parameter uncertainty and they are not even in comparable range further to understand the impact of gcm uncertainty and downscaling uncertainty over water balance projections we have prepared a table showing the water balance projections for future and past during each season of the year table 5 during the pre monsoon season precipitation shows a decrease across the model simulations except ipsl sd and mpi cordex there is an increase in evapotranspiration for ipsl cordex and ipsl sd the dynamically downscaled data show increased water yield and decreased soil moisture changes during the monsoon season the precipitation decrease in all the simulations except mpi cordex when all the simulations show an increase in evapotranspiration ipsl cordex and mpi sd show a decline the output corresponding to mpi cordex shows a reduced water yield other than ipsl sd all other simulations show reduced change in soil moisture the post monsoon precipitation is observed to decline except for that corresponding to ipsl cordex ipsl sd and mpi sd the evapotranspiration corresponding to ipsl sd mpi cordex and mpi sd show a decline except for the simulation corresponding to ipsl cordex water yield is observed to decline the changes in soil moisture have become more prominent for mpi cordex simulations ec sd mpi codex and mpi sd show reduced winter precipitation the change in evapotranspiration corresponding to ec earth cordex is negligible simulations of both the downscaled products of ipsl depict increased evapotranspiration the cordex outputs of ec earth and ipsl are observed to show increased water yield when all the others are found to decrease there is an overall decrease in the change in soil moisture across the winter season hence it can be concluded that the deviation in the trend in precipitation for different gcms and downscaling datasets is well reflected in the water balance projections in the present study only the sensitive parameters were considered in the mcs for a fairer comparison all model parameters had to be considered to be uncertain therefore a further analysis was performed by varying all the parameters in vic viz soil and vegetation parameters following uniform distribution the ranges for the parameters was procured from bennett et al 2018 we considered a range of 0 1 times the prescribed value for the parameters which were not considered in their study the width of the band of simulated streamflow did not increase significantly and the model performance for extremes low flow is still bad in the new simulations fig s1 the soil moisture and the et plots are also quiet similar to the previous ones figs s2 and s3 the uncertainty assessment did not bring much change in the spread of the output figs s4 s6 the bias correction approach followed in our study is based on quantile mapping developed by li et al 2010 it is a simple and straightforward technique that uses the difference between the cdfs derived from simulated and observed data the difference is then used to adjust the model cdf to remove the bias although it has been widely employed in many studies this method has certain limitations it does not take into consideration the co dependence of the gcm variables since it corrects single variable at a time moreover the bias correction is applied for a single time step without accounting for temporal oscillations mehrotra and sharma 2015 to examine whether a better bias correction accounting for variable dependence would reduce the uncertainty across gcms we used multivariate recursive nested bias correction mrnbc developed by mehrotra and sharma 2015 the bias correction has been carried out for all the predictors for downscaling viz relative humidity mean sea level pressure temperature at surface and 500 hpa uwind and vwind at surface and 500 hpa for all the 3 gcms we compare the uncertainty in the simulated changes of the predictor variables for future as obtained from both the bias correction methods the results are presented in fig 14 we find that uncertainty is getting magnified even after introducing an improved bias correction method this is consistently observed across all the variables except the mean sea level pressure mslp this further strengthens our conclusion that the uncertainty across gcms plays a major role in climate change impacts assessment over indian monsoon region and reduction of such uncertainty is not even possible with the introduction of more sophisticated and accurate data driven models this shows that one of the major challenge in hydrometeorology is the use of meteorological projections in hydrological applications though there are multiple methods such as multi model averaging bayesian model averaging etc to model uncertainty arising across climate models the question remains on the confidence of using the simulations of changes of hydrological variables for water management and climate change adaptation 4 summary and conclusions in the present study we attempt to understand the uncertainty resulting from hydrological parameterization in the background of the uncertainty arising from the use of multiple climate models we use the case study of ganga basin india with the hydrological model vic the hydrological parameter uncertainty is modelled with mcs we find that hydrological parameter uncertainty is almost negligible compared to the huge uncertainty resulting from the use of multiple gcms and downscaling here through mcs we have considered all possible values of hydrological parameters hence we may conclude that the possible error induced by a completely incorrect hydrological parametrization will be negligible compared to inter climate model differences hence from hydrological point of view the multi model climate change projections collectively do not provide any confidence to use them for adaptation the uncertainty in gcms may arise due to the multiple reasons such as the assumptions and parametrisation involved model physics no or limited knowledge about the future scenario and so on when it comes to the downscaling techniques the procedures followed in statistical and dynamic downscaling are entirely different in statistical downscaling the predictors and the predictand are related by a statistical relationship in contrast to this in dynamic downscaling a regional climate model is run using the gcm output as boundary condition understanding the differences between the outputs of statistical and dynamic downscaling is complex and complicated task as dynamical downscaling is more intricate due to the involvement of regional climate model with huge number of parameterizations this may be considered as the area of future research usually significant effort goes to the development of a hydrological model for a near correct estimation of the model parameters this becomes even more challenging when the model has limitations in some of the components of hydrological processes or some of the data is not available as for example for the present case vic does not have a ground water component that would lead to a good estimate of baseflow this limitation can be overcome by coupling the vic model with a groundwater model rosenberg et al 2013 have attempted to couple the vic model with a simple groundwater model simgm that represents the aquifer underlying the soil layers however it can be used only for the study of changes in the total water storage as the model assumes arbitrary aquifer thickness therefore a more sophisticated groundwater model is required to be coupled to vic model in order to include the groundwater interactions furthermore the data related to ground water irrigation is neither available nor the model has a good irrigation component representing the indian agricultural practices calibrating an incomplete model based on streamflow may lead to a good match for a wrong reason however the question remains that even for a hypothetical ideal hydrological model if significant efforts have been made to get all required data and perform parameterization with a huge effort will that add value in climate change projections we surprisingly arrive to a negative answer and it attributes to the uncertain meteorological projections even after significant improvements in climate models and their physics they are not good enough for a hydro meteorological projections which can be used for climate adaptation with confidence negligible hydrological parameter uncertainty with respect to climate model uncertainty arrives to a conclusion that a poorly calibrated hydrological model representing the hydrological processes wrong has negligible error compared to inter climate model uncertainty however it should be noted that in a hydrological sense these errors may be quite high and this gives the idea about the extent of poor agreements across climate models this reduces the confidence of hydrologist to further use the projections for water management the results do not say that hydrological parameterization is not required rather emphasize on the urgent need of reducing uncertainty across climate models before providing any input to the water manager community it should be noted that recent literature mockler et al 2016 also suggests that hydrological parameter uncertainty is on lower side compared to multi model hydrological uncertainty model structure uncertainty this is a clear limitation of the present study and can be assessed by using multiple number of hydrological models as suggested by moeck et al 2016 and summarised in smerdon 2017 hence the future scope of the work lies in the use of multiple hydrological models and comparison of the resulting uncertainty with the climate model uncertainty however the

6925,assessing impacts of climate change on hydrology involves global scale climate projections by general circulation models gcms downscaling of global scale projections to regional scale by statistical methods or regional climate models and then use of regional outputs in hydrological simulations hydrological simulations considers varying inputs starting with soil characteristics land cover vegetation types control structures to social parameters such as human interventions irrigation and water use this makes the model highly parametrized and at the same time highly uncertain due to the non availability of majority of input parameters here we compare the contributions of uncertainty from hydrological parameterization in the hydrological projections of climate change to that generated from the use of multiple climate models the ganga river basin in india was selected as the study region for regional climate change projections we use dynamic downscaling outputs from coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex and statistical downscaling outputs from a transfer function forced with 3 gcms institut pierre simon laplace ipsl european consortium earth system model ec earth and mpi max plank institut esm earth system model monte carlo simulations mcs are performed with 1000 generated sets of sensitive model parameters for each of the gcm regional model combination we find that the observed time series of river discharge is reproduced well but with bias in low flow conditions this is probably associated with human intervention and poor representation of baseflow in vic due to the neglected groundwater storage which feed the surface water during low flow condition the future projections show that the major uncertainty lies across climate models for all the four seasons mam jjas on and djf and for all the hydrological variables soil moisture evapotranspiration et water yield and river discharge the uncertainty resulting from the mcs is quite small as compared to the climate model uncertainty we are unable to find any added value in hydrological simulations by rigorous hydrological calibration and parameterization in absence of many required data when the forcing meteorological data has huge uncertainty our findings highlight the need of convergence of climate models before the studies on hydrological impacts assessment and subsequent development of adaptation strategies keywords climate change hydrologic impacts uncertainty parameter uncertainty hydrologic model of large basin 1 introduction the study of regional hydrologic implications of changing climate has crucial role in the management of water resources the water cycle is expected to be accelerated as a result of the increase in temperature oki and kanae 2006 the intensity frequency and duration of precipitation events are expected to change with warming kumar et al 1992 trenberth et al 2003 wild and liepert 2010 evapotranspiration soil moisture and runoff are highly sensitive to even small changes in temperature and precipitation chattopadhyay and hulme 1997 milly et al 2005 seneviratne et al 2010 gcms provide the information about the future climate by simulating time series of climate variables with greenhouse gas effect over the atmosphere prudhomme et al 2003 however gcms are at very coarse resolution and for regional climate change impact studies it has to be brought to finer scale by downscaling regional hydroclimatic modelling hence involves the following steps simulating the future climate variables using gcms downscaling the outputs to basin scale and using this as forcing to hydrological models for assessing hydrological impacts of climate change a number of hydrological models based on water and energy balances have been developed in the recent past for this purpose arnell 1999 döll et al 2003 gleick 1986 liang et al 1996 1994 vorosmarty and moore 1991 numerous attempts have been made to understand the land surface hydrologic responses to climate change using the macroscale hydrological models for specific geographic locations christensen et al 2004 hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 lettenmaier and gan 1990 including indian river basins singh and kumar 1997 gosain et al 2006 raje et al 2014 the impact assessment however is associated with uncertainties that are involved in each step of hydroclimatic modeling i e uncertainty in gcm projections downscaling uncertainty and hydrological parameter uncertainty leavesley 1994 xu 1999 representing these uncertainties in climate change impact studies is equally important and at the same time considering all its sources concurrently is challenging multiple number of gcms have been developed with different algorithms for land atmosphere ocean interactions hence giving different outputs therefore the projected hydrological variables are highly dependent on the gcms employed in the study these uncertainties are assessed with the use of information from multiple gcms e g allen et al 2000 lee and kim 2013 new and hulme 2000 simonovic et al 2003 simonovic and li 2004 tebaldi et al 2005 some of the approaches to address the uncertainty across climate models include non parametric approach ghosh and mujumdar 2007 possibilistic approach mujumdar and ghosh 2008 imprecise probability ghosh and mujumdar 2009 analysis of variance hingray et al 2014 yip et al 2011 square root error variance woldemeskel et al 2016 2014 etc the above studies provide an interpretation of uncertainties limiting to that arising due to gcms and not focusing on the other aspects of it downscaling techniques can be broadly classified to statistical and dynamical downscaling in statistical downscaling a data driven relationship is derived between the predictors gcm simulated climate variable and predictands regional scale variable e g conway and jones 1998 chen et al 2010 groppelli et al 2011 jeong et al 2012 osca et al 2013 kannan and ghosh 2013 salvi et al 2013 sachindra et al 2013 santos et al 2016 dynamic downscaling makes use of regional climate models rcms e g jones et al 1995 dobler and ahrens 2010 2011 krishna kumar et al 2011 liu et al 2013 dosio et al 2015 scinocca et al 2016 though both the methods have their own advantages and limitations the assumptions involved in it adds to the uncertainty fowler et al 2007 the uncertainty arising due to the use of different methods of statistical downscaling have been modelled in the recent past ghosh and katkar 2012 gutmann et al 2014 hu et al 2013 khan et al 2006 samadi et al 2013 the uncertainty resulting from the use of different observed data used for model calibration in statistical downscaling was studied by kannan et al 2014 the assessment of different dynamical downscaling methods im et al 2010 kumar et al 2013 mishra 2015 singh et al 2016 and inter comparison of statistical and dynamical downscaling techniques chen et al 2011a flaounas et al 2013 vaittinada ayar et al 2016 were also performed in various studies it can be inferred from the above studies that a major portion of uncertainty is explained by the choice of downscaling method along with the selection of gcms hydrological models on the other hand are highly parametrized some of which are heterogeneous in space and time or cannot be measured a number of calibration techniques have been developed which uses observed data as a reference to obtain the approximate value of these parameters moradkhani and sorooshian 2009 troy et al 2008 yapo et al 1996 difficulty in obtaining unique set of parameters lack of accurate observed data etc lead to parameter uncertainty in hydrological models uncertainty assessment in hydroclimatic simulations involving hydrological models have become recent research trend wilby and harris 2006 proposed a probabilistic framework considering ensemble of 4 gcms 2 scenarios 2 downscaling techniques 2 hydrological model structures and 2 sets of hydrological model parameters for assessing the uncertainty in climate change impacts on low flow scenario of river thames uk use of multiple hydrological models is also observed in multiple studies to assess the uncertainty teng et al 2012 velázquez et al 2013 various techniques like multi objective calibration approach ruelland et al 2015 generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation beven and binley 1992 bayesian model averaging bastola et al 2011 technique were utilized for uncertainty assessment raje and krishnan 2012 used the bayesian approach implemented by markov chain monte carlo method to assess the uncertainty in vic model under hydroclimatic studies for indian river basins extensive amount of research has been carried out for the uncertainty assessment of hydrological impacts of climate change by the consideration of multiple gcms downscaling techniques hydrological models and parameters e g jiang et al 2007 bastola et al 2011 chen et al 2011b bae et al 2011 chen et al 2012 bosshard et al 2013 apart from the uncertainty assessment few studies aim at evaluating the extent to which the climate change adaptation strategies are affected by uncertainty refsgaard et al 2013 and possible ways of reducing it raje and mujumdar 2009 refsgaard et al 2016 previous uncertainty assessment studies have been summarized in table 1 as observed in the table previous studies largely performed hydrologic model calibration based on observed streamflow data and used the same to understand hydrologic model parameter uncertainty they have used either statistical or dynamic downscaling or a simple bias correction without downscaling though there have been a consistent finding that gcm uncertainty dominates global and regional hydrological cycle has been significantly affected by human interventions jaramillo and destouni 2015 such as irrigation reservoir operation ground water pumping and majority of the available land surface models lsms are unable to simulate all of them together haddeland et al 2006a 2006b leng et al 2014 rosenberg et al 2013 furthermore there is often non availability of data pertaining to the same hence the hydrologic model calibration for indian case studies is extremely difficult and often erroneous because models can not consider the water regulation due to non availability of data models without accounting for water regulation consider observed flows for calibration but these flows are regulated flows in india hence such a calibration may capture the streamflow but for a wrong reason e g döll et al 2008 raje et al 2014 syed et al 2014 chawla and mujumdar 2015 the other set of studies use the recommended values of parameters without a specific calibration mishra et al 2010 and they have been criticized to misrepresent the hydrological system with uncalibrated parameters though not tested through a proper framework rather than going for an erroneous model calibration due to lack of available data the hydrologic model parameters were allowed to consider any possible value this allows maximum possible uncertainty due to parameterization which is of much higher magnitude than any other estimation of uncertainty incorporating calibration even such an uncertainty remains insignificant with respect to the climate model uncertainty and this raises a very important question on the readiness of using such uncertain projections for climate change adaptation this specific science question has not been addressed in any of the available literature for large river basins in south asia further to this the analysis was not limited just with streamflow as the majority of available streamflow data are regulated but considered other variables such as soil moisture and et to understand the complete picture of changing water cycle unlike other studies we have not considered only a single suit of downscaling rather considered both statistical and dynamic downscaling to present the complete picture of uncertainty this analysis is an advancement with respect to other studies in terms of i consideration of complete uncertainty from multiple gcms and downscaling methods ii assessing multiple hydrologic variables to understand changing pattern of the water cycle iii allowing maximum possible uncertainty in hydrologic parameterization to show the significance of climate model uncertainty and finally iv checking the adequacy and preparedness of climate models to be used in hydrologic impacts assessment here we address the science question on the impacts of hydrological parameter uncertainty in the background of gcm and downscaling uncertainty we attempt to compare and understand the contribution of uncertainty from climate models and hydrologic parameterization to the hydroclimatic projections with a case study application of ganga river basin india the variable infiltration capacity vic model which is a semi distributed macroscale hydrological model is implemented for this purpose the major objectives of the study are i to assess the uncertainty in hydrologic impacts of climate change over ganga basin in the context of gcm uncertainty downscaling uncertainty and parameter uncertainty ii to render the spread of climate induced changes in output variables streamflow et soil moisture and water yield from all the possible values of the uncertain parameters in vic model and compare it with gcm and downscaling uncertainty we use mcs with the vic model considering the sensitive parameters to be uncertain selection of sensitive parameters is performed based on earlier studies demaria et al 2007 we assume that soil parameters follow triangular distribution muleta and nicklow 2005 where the mode is the recommended value of the parameters and the base of the triangles are the possible ranges the vegetation parameters are considered to follow uniform distribution within a range of 0 1 times the prescribed value since the ranges were unknown random numbers are generated for each of the parameters using these distributions and ranges the dynamic downscaled cordex and statistical downscaled transfer function outputs of 3 gcms ipsl ec earth and mpi esm are used as meteorological forcings for each of the gcm downscaling combination mcs are performed for the vic model using 1000 generated sets of parameters the results are compared for the assessment of uncertainty the following section presents the details of data and methodology used 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area the ganga basin located within the geographical coordinates of 73⁰30 e to 89⁰0

average rainfall of 110 cm the monsoon months are from june to september with rainfall spatially varying from 39 to 200 cm nrcd moef 2009 the ganga river is snow fed and hence maintains a moderate level of streamflow throughout the year with maximum discharge during the monsoon months causing flood in the plains the ganga basin is characterised by large variation in altitude ranging from 7000 m at the himalayan mountains to 50 m in the gangetic plain it is the largest and most cultivated basin in the country with dense population the land use land cover over the region is shown in fig 1 b there is an increase in the water demand for the last few decades to meet the needs of growing population posing a stress to surface water and groundwater hence making the climate change studies inevitable for this basin 2 2 regional climate model simulations the dynamically and statistically downscaled output of 3 gcms ipsl ec earth and mpi esm are considered for climate change projections the cordex simulations are used as dynamic downscaling output where rcms were forced with lateral boundaries from global ipsl ec earth and mpi esm and run at a resolution of 50 km over the cordex south asian domain the regional models used for downscaling are regional climatic model version 4 regcm4 for ipsl rossby centre regional atmospheric model version 4 rca4 for ec earth singh et al 2016 and remo regional model 2009 for mpi esm the output of these runs were acquired from the cordex south asia group http cccr tropmet res in home index jsp at daily scale the representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 emission scenario which is a midrange scenario taylor et al 2012 is considered the choice of the gcm was based on the availability of their output among the cordex regional simulations for south asia provided by centre for climate change research cccr only ipsl ec earth and mpi have surface wind speed data for historical as well as future rcp 45 time period we use both the simulations for historical period 1979 2005 and future period 2011 2037 the rcm simulated climate variables may have realistic spatial patterns but have bias from the observed value and need to be corrected here we perform the same by quantile based bias correction method developed by li et al 2010 the observed data used as reference is indian meteorological department imd gridded data products of precipitation rajeevan et al 2006 rajeevan and bhate 2009 and temperature srivastava et al 2009 imd had rainfall observations at 6076 stations for varying time intervals the dataset was developed using about 3500 rain gauge stations on an average for daily analysis statistical downscaling method includes the development of an empirical relationship between the predictors gcm simulated climate variable and the predictands regional scale variable it can be broadly classified into three weather generators weather typing and transfer functions the weather type models are observed to fail in terms of simulating the spatial variability of the daily precipitation conway and jones 1998 although the weather generator models such as conditional random field by raje and mujumdar 2009 overcome the above drawback of weather typing method they still fail to simulate the mean condition and spatial cross correlations across stations in a given region it also demands large number of parameters and computational expense the downscaling model used in the present study involves the use of kernel regression coupled with classification and regression tree cart developed by kannan and ghosh 2013 and salvi et al 2013 the main strengths of this method over other available downscaling technique are its ability to capture the cross correlation between the stations and to project the mean rainfall with high accuracy salvi et al 2013 have shown that the orography is also captured well by the model hence performing better in simulating the monsoon in comparison to other downscaling models as the first step the variables that directly affect the rainfall processes are selected as the predictors temperature pressure specific humidity u wind and v wind at surface and 500 hpa pressure level are used as predictors in the present case the bias in these predictor variables are corrected with respect to the reanalysis data by national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar using quantile based mapping technique li et al 2010 the bias corrected data is characterised by multidimensionality and multicollinearity which has to be reduced before using it for statistical downscaling in order to reduce the number of dimensions with minimum decrease in the variability of data principal component analysis pca is applied to the bias corrected predictor variables to obtain the principal components the next step is to classify the days based on the spatial pattern of rainfall in the zone of interest and we use k means clustering as adopted by kannan and ghosh 2013 the relationship between the principal components and the rainfall states for the observed period is derived using classification and regression tree cart which is a decision tree learning technique using the developed relationship and the future principal components from bias corrected gcm simulations we obtain the rainfall state for the future time period in order to project the future rainfall from future states the kernel regression technique is utilized the kernel regression is a non parametric technique and can be used to estimate the conditional probability of a random variable the developed kernel regression in applied to the predictors and derived stated from bias corrected gcm simulations to obtain the daily rainfall projections for temperature we use direct bias correction techniques and they are more reliable and smoother as compared to rainfall hughes et al 1993 2 3 hydrological simulations with variable infiltration capacity model vic model is a semi distributed macroscale hydrological model in which the water and energy balance equations are solved grid wise liang et al 1994 the sub grid heterogeneity in vegetation is considered by dividing each grid into smaller tiles based on the land cover vic also considers variation in the soil moisture capacity at subgrid level non linear recession of baseflow and topography that accounts to orographic precipitation and temperature lapse rate multiple layers of soil can be considered in vic but generally it is taken as 3 with first 2 layers showing dynamic response to the infiltrated rainfall and the third layer showing seasonal variation of soil moisture the runoff occurs from the bottom layer according to arno model please refer liang et al 1994 for furtur details the upward movement of moisture is transported by evapotranspiration through the roots of the vegetation the evapotranspiration is calculated using penman monteith equation considering it as a function of vapour pressure deficit and net radiation the interception of rainfall by the canopy is calculated as a function of lai the soil properties are considered to be same throughout each grid cell the model can be run in either water balance or energy balance at daily or sub daily time step once the energy balance and water balance are computed routing model lohmann et al 1998 is employed to calculate the streamflow using the runoff and baseflow from each grid snow module can be kept active to account for snowmelt energy balance approach is used to represent the snow accumulation and ablation according to andreadis et al 2009 based on the total capacity of snow the water holding capacity is defined and the newly intercepted water is calculated with respect to it the excess of water holding capacity will be the snowmelt the inputs for vic model includes meteorological data precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature and wind soil properties land use vegetation properties and topographical details the parameters in the model are listed in table 2 vic has been extensively used for climate change and land use change impact studies drought assessment hydrological forecasting etc chawla and mujumdar 2015 haddeland et al 2006b mishra et al 2010 nijssen et al 2001a b nijssen et al 1997 the vic model includes certain parameters which cannot be measured in situ since they are extremely heterogeneous in nature or they are not physically observable these parameters are usually calibrated by minimising the difference between simulated and observed data few of the calibration parameters are i dsmax mm day it is the maximum velocity of the baseflow for the lowest layer of soil and it can vary between 0 and 30 depending on hydraulic conductivity it is calculated by multiplying the slope of the grid cell with saturated hydraulic conductivity ii ds fraction it is the fraction of dsmax where non linear baseflow occurs it varies in the range of 0 1 and an initial value of 0 001 can be assumed with high ds in the bottom soil layer and with lower water content the baseflow is high the baseflow parameter is highly sensitive in basins with snow accumulation and snow melt raje and krishnan 2012 iii ws fraction it is the maximum soil moisture at the lowest layer where non linear baseflow occurs and is analogous to ds the runoff peaks get delayed with higher value of ws since the water content will be raised with rapidly increasing the non linear baseflow its value is in the range of 0 1 generally greater than 0 5 iv binf it denotes the shape of the variable infiltration capacity curve the available infiltration capacity is linked to the relative saturated grid cell area by this parameter it varies between 0 and 0 4 high value of binf leads to high infiltration and low surface runoff the partitioning of rainfall snowmelt to direct runoff and infiltration is hence controlled by this parameter v soil depth m the soil depth of second and the third layers are considered for calibration and they are in the range of 0 1 1 5 m as the soil depth increases the seasonal peak flows get delayed and the evapotranspiration increases in the present study apart from the soil parameters few of the vegetation parameters were also considered to be sensitive leaf area index lai rooting depth vegetation roughness length and vegetation displacement height are regarded to be uncertain following a uniform distribution 2 3 1 data used in vic the topographic details are derived from digital elevation map dem from u s geological survey usgs hydro1k dataset at 1 km resolution https lta cr usgs gov hydro1k raje et al 2014 the land use land cover lulc data are acquired from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr available at the website of university of maryland at a spatial resolution of 1 km hansen et al 2000 raje et al 2014 the values of soil parameters were directly procured from the 0 5 global input parameter available at the vic model website the soil file is the interpolated version of the 2 degree global file developed by nijssen et al 2001a b which was prepared using soil map by food and agricultural organisation 1995 the sub sampling was carried using nearest neighbourhood approach the metrological data required for running the vic model are rainfall air temperature extremes and wind speed the observed precipitation and temperature data are obtained from the imd and wind speed data from climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr all these data are brought to a grid resolution of 0 5 at which the model is implemented the observed streamflow at monthly scales for two stations bhimagodha and ankinghat are obtained from the cwc for validation of the simulated discharge the regulated flow is converted to naturalized flow by incorporating the data pertaining to the water control diversion structure in the upstream of the ankinghat gauge station water is diverted from the main ganga river by diversion structures viz upper ganga canal east ganga canal madhya ganga canal east ganga canal and lower ganga canal the data corresponding to the canals were obtained from the cwc and added to the monthly discharge at ankinghat gauge station in order to convert the regulated streamflow to naturalised streamflow the same methodology was also used in chawla and mujumdar 2015 for further understanding an example of monthly discharge calculation for the year 2000 is given table s1 the satellite based soil moisture data used for validation is a merged product from european space agency climate change initiative esa cci which is at a spatial resolution of 0 25 and temporal resolution of daily scale for the period of 1978 2005 the simulated et is validated using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mod16 global terrestrial evapotranspiration data set which is at monthly time scale and at a spatial resolution of 1 km it is available for a period of 2000 2010 the in situ soil moisture for two stations viz krn and klni at a 7 day interval during the monsoon season was procured from imd 2 4 monte carlo simulations mcs is a method of translating the uncertainty in the model inputs parameters to the model output probability distributions for the inputs parameters are assumed and random samples are generated which are utilized to execute the model complex systems can be easily described through mcs even though being computationally very expensive and time consuming monte carlo method has a wide variety of application including sensitivity analysis of hydrological models and uncertainty assessments demaria et al 2007 used the monte carlo approach to study the sensitivity and identifiability of parameters controlling surface and sub surface flow wilby 2005 used the monte carlo sampling approach in the historic climate variability context to understand parameters stability and identifiability mcs to represent uncertainties were also used by new and hulme 2000 and prudhomme et al 2002 in our study we assume that the sensitive soil parameters described in section 2 3 1 to follow triangular distribution with base being the prescribed range and mode being the recommended value http www hydro washington edu lettenmaier models vic datasets datasets shtml the vegetation parameters are assumed to follow uniform distribution with a range of 0 1 times the prescribed value the reason for choosing a range of 0 1 times the prescribed value is completely arbitrary and is one of the drawback of present study assuming these distributions 1000 random numbers are generated for each of these sensitive parameters and the model is executed considering these set of generated parameters these simulations are first performed for the observed period to evaluate the performance of the model for climate projections we executed these simulations for 4 sets of meteorological forcings which include statistically and dynamically downscaled products of 2 gcms ipsl and ec earth the results and interpretations of the simulations using monte carlo method are described in the following section 3 results and discussions 3 1 model performance the discharge data procured from central water commission cwc for the two stations ankinghat and bhimagodha are for a period of 1977 2009 and 1990 2011 respectively further to this the modis et data covers a time period of 2000 2010 hence a common period of 10 years i e 2000 2009 was selected for validation and the results are shown in fig 2 river routing is performed for the two stations bhimagodha and ankinghat which are located in the upper ganga basin as shown in fig 1a time series of monthly discharge as obtained from the observed data and from simulations performed 1000 times under the monte carlo scheme at these two stations are presented in fig 2 a and b for the simulated discharge the band shows the uncertainty range and line shows the observed time series the pattern of the observed discharge especially the rising and the recession limbs are well captured by the simulations although the peaks do not match at bhimagodha station the error in modelling the extreme precipitation is a possible reason for the discrepancies in simulated peaks of streamflow here the fact to be highlighted is that the basin under consideration is highly human intervened and the observed streamflow is controlled by reservoirs and dams we also find negative bias in the low flow conditions which attributes to the groundwater contributions to the baseflow which is not considered in vic chawla and mujumdar 2015 the surface fluxes are greatly influenced by the groundwater interactions with an exception in case of arid regions where the groundwater can be disconnected rosenberg et al 2013 the groundwater gets recharged during the wetter periods and contributes to the streamflow during the drier periods in the indian scenario during the low flow period november to may groundwater is the key supplier to streamflow chawla and mujumdar 2015 since the groundwater interactions are not considered the model fails in reproducing the streamflow during the low flow conditions moreover same mismatches were observed in the study by chawla and mujumdar 2015 the simulated soil moisture was compared with the in situ soil moisture available from imd for 7 day interval during monsoon season in fig 2 c and d the band shows the range of simulated soil moisture and the line represents the observed soil moisture both at a depth of 30 cm during june september 2005 for two stations viz krl and klni the pattern of the soil moisture is well captured by the model at the both stations the performance of the hydrological simulations is also evaluated with the correlation coefficients between observed and simulated soil moisture and evapotranspiration the observed and simulated values show good correlation with coefficients in the range of 0 7 0 9 during the monsoon and post monsoon season for both soil moisture and et fig 2 f g j and k the poor correlation coefficients in the other two seasons probably attribute to the non consideration of ground water contribution fig 2 e h i and l the groundwater dynamics influences the soil moisture which in due course affects the water and energy fluxes between land and atmosphere fan et al 2007 the coupling of vic with groundwater model by liang 2003 resulted in drier soil moisture in the top layers and lesser evapotranspiration in comparison to default vic thus the non consideration of groundwater in the model contributes to the bias in estimated soil moisture and evapotranspiration we have calculated the model performance statistics nash sutcliffe efficiency nse correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and refined index of agreement dr willmott et al 2012 considering river discharge soil moisture and et for each of the simulations and depicted the extreme cases in table 3 we find that when nse shows lowest value for streamflow its performance is better for other variables as compared to that corresponding to highest nse of streamflow this necessitates the use of all hydrologic variables rather than focussing only on streamflow this further explains the reason behind non removal of any of the simulations from uncertainty estimation further to this the non regulated streamflow is only available for upper ganga basin hence we cannot calibrate the model for entire ganges with the same data considering these facts we allow the model parameters to freely take any values to get a better picture of uncertainty a considerable area of the basin is cropland with intensive irrigation fig 1 b hence the other reason behind poor correlation could be the non consideration of irrigation in vic model the seasonal mean of the vic simulated evapotranspiration also shows good resemblance with modis et in all seasons except monsoon fig 3 a h during the monsoon season there is a high discrepancy between the simulated and modis et it should be noted that the cloud cover is very high during monsoon and that may lead to an erroneous et data from satellite the modis products the mismatch may attribute to the quality of observed remote sensing datasets we find a good resemblance in the shape of climatological et between modis and simulated data though the simulated data overestimates the same fig 3i for further investigation we plot et from cfsr interim ecmwf re analysis era interim and modern era retrospective analysis merra and find a consistent underestimation of et by modis inaccuracies in the et from modis due to over or underestimation has been reported in other studies kim et al 2012 ramoelo et al 2014 the satellite observed soil moisture data acquired from esa cci covers a depth of 0 5 2 cm the depth of the top layer in our model is 0 3 m and hence comparing it with satellite soil moisture will have its own limitations we have made the assumption that the soil moisture is uniformly distributed over the top layer and calculated the soil moisture at a depth of 2 cm for the purpose of calculating the correlation coefficient the resampling of the data to the spatial resolution of the model was done using the method of bilinear interpolation the spatial plots of mean observed and simulated soil moisture following the same methodology is plotted for all the four seasons of the year fig 4 it is observed that the spatial pattern soil moisture is captured well by the model for different seasons but with non uniform biases 3 2 future projections the spatial pattern of the mean of accumulated precipitation over various seasons for each gcm downscaling combination with that of imd observed data is compared in fig 5 it can be observed that the overall spatial pattern is captured well by the downscaled models with a few exceptions all the models perform well during monsoon and winter season however during the pre monsoon and post monsoon ec earth cordex and ipsl cordex output tend to overestimate precipitation over the upper and middle reaches of the basin small changes in temperature or precipitation can cause an amplified impact on the components of water cycle milly et al 2005 therefore we compare the spatial pattern of seasonal changes in precipitation and temperature from each of the gcm downscaling combination in figs 6 and 7 respectively ec earth cordex ipsl cordex and mpi cordex represent the dynamic downscaled output of ec earth ipsl and mpi respectively whereas ec earth sd ipsl sd and mpi sd represents the corresponding statistical downscaled product each row in fig 6 represents mean of changes in precipitation between the periods of 2011 2037 and 1979 2005 for each of the seasons pre monsoon mam monsoon jjas post monsoon on and winter djf and columns indicate different gcm downscaling combinations similar sequence is followed for maximum and minimum temperature in fig 7 during the pre monsoon all the projections except that corresponding to ipsl show moderate increase in precipitation over most of the regions few regions are observed to have no change in the projected precipitation in the lower ganga basin very high increment of pre monsoon precipitation can be observed for ec earth cordex ipsl cordex and mpi sd we observe a decline in precipitation in the upper and middle ganga for ipsl cordex during the monsoon season we find a mild to moderate increase in precipitation at most of the places in the basin except in case of mpi products a decline in precipitation can be observed in upper ganga basin for mpi cordex and mpi sd the decline being more pronounced in case of the latter however there is a high increase in monsoon precipitation in the middle and lower reaches of the basin for mpi sd simulation ec earth cordex and ec earth sd show an increase in precipitation during the post monsoon season ipsl cordex and mpi sd show exactly opposite change the six simulations provide six entirely different precipitation scenarios of winter precipitation it is important to note that for other seasons there is occasional agreement in large scale trends however the spatial patterns are almost entirely different across different model runs for all the seasons similarly the maximum temperature also shows variations in the spatial pattern for each season all the projections for maximum temperature show increase the magnitude being more for ipsl sd mpi cordex and mpi sd 1 2 1 6 during winter ec earth cordex mpi cordex and mpi sd show very high increase in maximum temperature similar results are obtained for minimum temperature ec earth sd and mpi sd showing maximum increase during the post monsoon and winter respectively it can be noted that during monsoon season the projections of maximum temperature from multiple gcm downscaling combinations have higher agreements overall it is evident that there are high discrepancies across gcms and downscaling models for the precipitation and temperature projections during all the seasons we also plotted the trends in the precipitation maximum and minimum temperature in the figs 8 10 respectively in fig 8a the trend across the 3 gcms are considered with the band representing the uncertainty due to downscaling the precipitation trend across different downscaling techniques statistical and dynamical downscaling is represented in fig 8b the band depicting the uncertainty across gcms in fig 8c the trend in precipitation across the 3 gcms and 2 downscaling techniques is shown in general the future precipitation is observed to decrease the peaks in the precipitation is sharper for the future scenarios the maximum and minimum temperatures show increasing trend in future figs 9 and 10 as expected the uncertainty due to the downscaling technique is less as compared to the gcm uncertainty the uncertainty arising from multiple gcms when they are used in statistical downscaling is explained by calculating the partial correlation of the predictors involved in statistical downscaling with respect to the predictands for all the gcms table 4 it can be observed that the values of the partial correlation has wide range of variation among the gcms during all seasons with inconsistencies even in signs the surface humidity shows a positive correlation for all the gcms during the past and future the values have a wide range across gcms with negative values during some of the seasons and this results into uncertainty in the projections of precipitation similarly the sea level pressure shows a wide variation in the correlation values even though it is mostly negative during the past the partial correlation value for temperature at 500 hpa are not consistent even with the signs similar is the case with surface u wind and v wind at 500 hpa during both past and future the other predictors also show a wide variations in the partial correlation from the above observations it can be concluded that the relation between predictors and predictand is different across different gcms even when the same downscaling is applied and this results into very high uncertainty in the projections 3 3 uncertainty in hydrologic projection hydrologic modeling is performed with vic for the historical simulations and future projections using the meteorological data as obtained for different gcms and downscaling combinations mcs are performed to assess the uncertainty in river discharge the simulated changes in discharge for future 2011 2037 with respect to the past 1979 2005 corresponding to each of the 1000 sets of simulations during each season are represented in fig 11 with the help of box plots each of the box plot corresponds to the output for the six meteorological forcing sets the width of each of the box plots denotes the spread of the projected changes resulting from 1000 simulations corresponding to a specific gcm downscaling combination and hence it quantifies the hydrologic parameter uncertainty the differences between two box plots show the climate model uncertainty from fig 11 it is clearly visible that the range of variation in discharge due to parameter uncertainty is very less when compared to the climate model uncertainty the width of box plots for all the cases look almost insignificant as compared to the differences in positions between the boxes there is also no overlap between the boxes showing very high uncertainty resulting from the use of multiple climate models for all the seasons for example during the pre monsoon season where the dynamic downscaled product of all the three gcms show decrease in the streamflow the statistical downscaled products show increase in the same the differences across models are not just in terms of values but also in terms of the signs in changes such a huge uncertainty provides very little confidence to the policy makers to use the projections for water management in adapting to climate change if we consider the individual simulation the changes in precipitation and temperature are reflected well in the simulated streamflow at the two stations for the pre monsoon season the impacts of increase in the precipitation is prominent in the streamflow for ipsl sd and mpi sd streamflow corresponding to all the cordex simulations show prominent decrease which is attributed to the decline in precipitation in monsoon season there is an overall increase in streamflow for ankinghat in exception to that corresponding to both the mpi products which is very similar to the changes in precipitation in the upper to middle ganga basin on the other hand at bhimagodha the simulated streamflow from ipsl sd and mpi cordex show a decline due to reduced precipitation as well as increase in temperature at the upper reaches of the basin during the post monsoon and winter season the pattern of changes in the streamflow is clearly driven by precipitation we observe that the simulated streamflow from ec earth sd has the maximum increase and that from ipsl cordex shows a decrease which is analogous to their corresponding precipitation pattern also large differences in changes in simulated river discharge across the statistical and dynamically downscaled data is observed that can be attributed to the difference in the projected precipitation the changes in discharge for ec earth during the post monsoon and winter show huge differences between the statistical and dynamically downscaled data which is analogous to the precipitation pattern during the post monsoon season upper reaches of the ganga basin show an increase in precipitation of more than 50 mm for ec earth sd on the other hand precipitation increase corresponding to ec earth cordex is in the range of 10 30 mm with a few grids showing an increase of 50 mm winter precipitation is also found to have large uncertainty across the ec earth cordex and ec earth sd 30 mm and 50 mm respectively hence it can be concluded that the huge difference in precipitation is the reason for the differences in the river discharge we further demonstrate and compare the uncertainties in terms of the probability density functions pdfs of hydrologic variables representing their spatial variability across the basin the spatial pdfs for the changes in evapotranspiration and soil moisture are shown in fig 12 with the band representing the parameter uncertainty and different colors showing the 6 gcm downscaling combinations the widths of the bands are very less when we compare them with the differences between the pdfs of different colors this further strengthens our conclusion that the parameter uncertainty is less compared to multi climate model uncertainty we also observe that the width of the band of pdf presenting the projected changes in et during monsoon is less than that of soil moisture the parameters like ds dsmax and ws are involved in the non linear formulation of the baseflow at the time of its rapid generation during extreme wet condition raje et al 2014 hence they are more sensitive to the soil moisture during the same season resulting an increase in uncertainty associated with their parameterization similarly the parameters sensitive to evapotranspiration vegetation parameters are activated during the dry season due to the limited supply of moisture to the plants fig 13 represents box plots for changes in the total water yield i e sum of baseflow and runoff ghosh et al 2016 for future 2011 2037 with respect to the past 1979 2005 averaged over each of the four seasons plotted separately for upper middle as well as lower ganga basin koshal 2014 the spread of the projected changes resulting from 1000 simulations corresponding to a specific gcm downscaling combination is represented by the width of each box plot similar to fig 11 it is observed in fig 13 that the width of box plot representing the hydrological parameter uncertainty is very less compared to the distance in positions between the boxes and this further supports the inference from the previous figures the water yield corresponding to ec earth cordex shows a decrease during pre monsoon season over the upper and middle ganga basin during monsoon and post monsoon we observe increase in water yield for all the regions of the basin however during the winter season decreased water yields are projected for upper and middle ganga basin for the simulations from ec earth sd during the pre monsoon season decreased water yield is projected for upper ganga increased water yield is projected for middle ganga and no change is observed for lower ganga basin during other seasons increased water yields are projected over all the regions of the basin the water yield corresponding to ipsl cordex is projected to increase during the pre monsoon and monsoon season for upper and lower ganga basin there is a widespread decrease in the water yield for ipsl cordex during the post monsoon and winter season over the upper and middle ganga basin the water yield corresponding to ipsl sd is projected to increase over all the regions during the all the seasons except post monsoon where there is a slight decrement in lower ganga basin an increment in the water yield is observed during the pre monsoon season for mpi cordex over all the three regions however during the monsoon season there is a decline in water yield over the basin other than lower ganga basin we can observe a mild increase in the water yield for upper and lower ganga basin during post monsoon season in the middle ganga basin on the other hand the water yield shows negligible change during winter there is widespread increment of water yield except over the lower ganga basin the water yield is projected to increase over all the three reaches of the basin throughout all the seasons for mpi sd similar to fig 11 changes in temperature and precipitation are clearly exhibited by the changes in water yield fig 13 the results are presented separately for upper middle and lower ganga basins a upper ganga basin in the upper ganga basin which is a hilly region the changes in water yield is dependent on both precipitation and temperature the snowmelt contributes significantly to the water yield at the grids with higher altitude especially during the pre monsoon season and hence temperature plays a vital role over those grids during the pre monsoon season ec earth cordex shows a decline in water yield which is possibly due to the reduction in the precipitation in that region the water yield corresponding to ec earth sd is observed to have a mild decline which is attributed to the nearly negligible precipitation change the water yields as simulated by vic with meteorological inputs from ipsl cordex ipsl sd mpi cordex and mpi sd show an increase with ipsl sd and mpi cordex being slightly higher during the monsoon season the water yield as projected for all the regions with all the combinations except mpi cordex show an increase with higher increment for ec earth cordex and ipsl cordex over upper ganga basin similar pattern is observed for the changes in precipitation during the post monsoon season an increase in water yield is generally observed except for ipsl cordex simulations which is directly related to the changes in precipitation the maximum increase in water yield is observed for simulations forced with ec earth sd which is similar to the changing precipitation pattern during winter it can be observed that the water yield simulated with ec earth cordex and ipsl cordex outputs show decrease whereas the simulations using all the other gcm downscaling combinations show increase the maximum increase in precipitation is projected for ec earth sd and maximum decrease is for ipsl cordex which is well reflected on the changes in water yield the reduced precipitation projected by ec earth cordex in upper reaches may be the reason for decreased water yield b middle ganga basin as observed in upper ganga basin changes in precipitation is the major driving factor for variations in the water yield in the middle ganga basin with a few exceptions during pre monsoon season the water yield simulated with ec earth cordex and ipsl cordex shows a reduction which is attributed to the corresponding decrease in precipitation the projected precipitation from all other gcm downscaling combination show increase which is reflected in the water yield changes an overall increase in monsoon water yield can be observed in the middle ganga basin except for the simulation corresponding to mpi cordex which is attributed to the precipitation changes besides it can be noted that the maximum increase in precipitation is observed for mpi sd which is reflected in the water yield changes during the post monsoon season the pattern of changes in water yield is analogous to the monsoon season with an exception of ipsl cordex simulated water yield the changes in the precipitation is the major driving factor for this pattern the water yield simulated using ipsl sd meteorological data depicts a marginal increase following the corresponding pattern of changes in precipitation which include grids with mild increase decrease the reduced precipitation for ipsl cordex is captured well by the decline in corresponding simulated water yield during the winter season we observe that changes in water yield is highly dependent on the variations in precipitation the water yield simulated with ec earth cordex indicates a decrement which is probably due to decreased precipitation and the projected increase in temperature causing more evaporation c lower ganga basin in lower ganga there is an interplay between the changes in precipitation and temperature during pre monsoon season ec earth cordex shows an increase in water yield which is possibly due to the increment in precipitation water yield for ec earth sd shows no change even though there is an increase in precipitation this could be due to the slight increase in temperature since the lower ganga is mostly flat terrain the water yield is highly dependent on temperature and subsequently on evapotranspiration water yields simulated with the outputs of both downscaled products of mpi and ipsl show increase ipsl cordex being greater during the pre monsoon season similar pattern can be noticed in projected precipitation as well during the monsoon season increments in the simulated water yield attribute to increase in precipitation during post monsoon season the increase in precipitation is reflected in the increased water yield for ec earth products the projected precipitation during post monsoon by ipsl cordex and ipsl sd shows mild increase and decrease at various regions the water yield corresponding to ipsl cordex shows mild increase and ipsl sd has no change which are clearly due to the pattern of changes in precipitation during winter season the slight increase in the rainfall for ec earth cordex is well reflected in the changes of water yield in case of ec earth sd and ipsl cordex the changes in precipitation has more influence on the changes in water yield it is also evident that increase in winter precipitation in mpi sd is the cause of increase in the water yield the simulated water yield and projected precipitation for ec earth sd is observed to have maximum increment for all the sub basins the multi climate model uncertainty dominates over the hydrological parameter uncertainty and they are not even in comparable range further to understand the impact of gcm uncertainty and downscaling uncertainty over water balance projections we have prepared a table showing the water balance projections for future and past during each season of the year table 5 during the pre monsoon season precipitation shows a decrease across the model simulations except ipsl sd and mpi cordex there is an increase in evapotranspiration for ipsl cordex and ipsl sd the dynamically downscaled data show increased water yield and decreased soil moisture changes during the monsoon season the precipitation decrease in all the simulations except mpi cordex when all the simulations show an increase in evapotranspiration ipsl cordex and mpi sd show a decline the output corresponding to mpi cordex shows a reduced water yield other than ipsl sd all other simulations show reduced change in soil moisture the post monsoon precipitation is observed to decline except for that corresponding to ipsl cordex ipsl sd and mpi sd the evapotranspiration corresponding to ipsl sd mpi cordex and mpi sd show a decline except for the simulation corresponding to ipsl cordex water yield is observed to decline the changes in soil moisture have become more prominent for mpi cordex simulations ec sd mpi codex and mpi sd show reduced winter precipitation the change in evapotranspiration corresponding to ec earth cordex is negligible simulations of both the downscaled products of ipsl depict increased evapotranspiration the cordex outputs of ec earth and ipsl are observed to show increased water yield when all the others are found to decrease there is an overall decrease in the change in soil moisture across the winter season hence it can be concluded that the deviation in the trend in precipitation for different gcms and downscaling datasets is well reflected in the water balance projections in the present study only the sensitive parameters were considered in the mcs for a fairer comparison all model parameters had to be considered to be uncertain therefore a further analysis was performed by varying all the parameters in vic viz soil and vegetation parameters following uniform distribution the ranges for the parameters was procured from bennett et al 2018 we considered a range of 0 1 times the prescribed value for the parameters which were not considered in their study the width of the band of simulated streamflow did not increase significantly and the model performance for extremes low flow is still bad in the new simulations fig s1 the soil moisture and the et plots are also quiet similar to the previous ones figs s2 and s3 the uncertainty assessment did not bring much change in the spread of the output figs s4 s6 the bias correction approach followed in our study is based on quantile mapping developed by li et al 2010 it is a simple and straightforward technique that uses the difference between the cdfs derived from simulated and observed data the difference is then used to adjust the model cdf to remove the bias although it has been widely employed in many studies this method has certain limitations it does not take into consideration the co dependence of the gcm variables since it corrects single variable at a time moreover the bias correction is applied for a single time step without accounting for temporal oscillations mehrotra and sharma 2015 to examine whether a better bias correction accounting for variable dependence would reduce the uncertainty across gcms we used multivariate recursive nested bias correction mrnbc developed by mehrotra and sharma 2015 the bias correction has been carried out for all the predictors for downscaling viz relative humidity mean sea level pressure temperature at surface and 500 hpa uwind and vwind at surface and 500 hpa for all the 3 gcms we compare the uncertainty in the simulated changes of the predictor variables for future as obtained from both the bias correction methods the results are presented in fig 14 we find that uncertainty is getting magnified even after introducing an improved bias correction method this is consistently observed across all the variables except the mean sea level pressure mslp this further strengthens our conclusion that the uncertainty across gcms plays a major role in climate change impacts assessment over indian monsoon region and reduction of such uncertainty is not even possible with the introduction of more sophisticated and accurate data driven models this shows that one of the major challenge in hydrometeorology is the use of meteorological projections in hydrological applications though there are multiple methods such as multi model averaging bayesian model averaging etc to model uncertainty arising across climate models the question remains on the confidence of using the simulations of changes of hydrological variables for water management and climate change adaptation 4 summary and conclusions in the present study we attempt to understand the uncertainty resulting from hydrological parameterization in the background of the uncertainty arising from the use of multiple climate models we use the case study of ganga basin india with the hydrological model vic the hydrological parameter uncertainty is modelled with mcs we find that hydrological parameter uncertainty is almost negligible compared to the huge uncertainty resulting from the use of multiple gcms and downscaling here through mcs we have considered all possible values of hydrological parameters hence we may conclude that the possible error induced by a completely incorrect hydrological parametrization will be negligible compared to inter climate model differences hence from hydrological point of view the multi model climate change projections collectively do not provide any confidence to use them for adaptation the uncertainty in gcms may arise due to the multiple reasons such as the assumptions and parametrisation involved model physics no or limited knowledge about the future scenario and so on when it comes to the downscaling techniques the procedures followed in statistical and dynamic downscaling are entirely different in statistical downscaling the predictors and the predictand are related by a statistical relationship in contrast to this in dynamic downscaling a regional climate model is run using the gcm output as boundary condition understanding the differences between the outputs of statistical and dynamic downscaling is complex and complicated task as dynamical downscaling is more intricate due to the involvement of regional climate model with huge number of parameterizations this may be considered as the area of future research usually significant effort goes to the development of a hydrological model for a near correct estimation of the model parameters this becomes even more challenging when the model has limitations in some of the components of hydrological processes or some of the data is not available as for example for the present case vic does not have a ground water component that would lead to a good estimate of baseflow this limitation can be overcome by coupling the vic model with a groundwater model rosenberg et al 2013 have attempted to couple the vic model with a simple groundwater model simgm that represents the aquifer underlying the soil layers however it can be used only for the study of changes in the total water storage as the model assumes arbitrary aquifer thickness therefore a more sophisticated groundwater model is required to be coupled to vic model in order to include the groundwater interactions furthermore the data related to ground water irrigation is neither available nor the model has a good irrigation component representing the indian agricultural practices calibrating an incomplete model based on streamflow may lead to a good match for a wrong reason however the question remains that even for a hypothetical ideal hydrological model if significant efforts have been made to get all required data and perform parameterization with a huge effort will that add value in climate change projections we surprisingly arrive to a negative answer and it attributes to the uncertain meteorological projections even after significant improvements in climate models and their physics they are not good enough for a hydro meteorological projections which can be used for climate adaptation with confidence negligible hydrological parameter uncertainty with respect to climate model uncertainty arrives to a conclusion that a poorly calibrated hydrological model representing the hydrological processes wrong has negligible error compared to inter climate model uncertainty however it should be noted that in a hydrological sense these errors may be quite high and this gives the idea about the extent of poor agreements across climate models this reduces the confidence of hydrologist to further use the projections for water management the results do not say that hydrological parameterization is not required rather emphasize on the urgent need of reducing uncertainty across climate models before providing any input to the water manager community it should be noted that recent literature mockler et al 2016 also suggests that hydrological parameter uncertainty is on lower side compared to multi model hydrological uncertainty model structure uncertainty this is a clear limitation of the present study and can be assessed by using multiple number of hydrological models as suggested by moeck et al 2016 and summarised in smerdon 2017 hence the future scope of the work lies in the use of multiple hydrological models and comparison of the resulting uncertainty with the climate model uncertainty however the

6926,climate change will lead to great impacts on flood frequency curve and design floods in the future however traditional hydrologic approaches often fail to analyze the flood characteristics within a bivariate framework under changing environment moreover previous studies investigating bivariate characteristics of flood usually do not derive the adaptive flood quantiles this study assesses the implications of climate change for future bivariate quantiles of flood peak and volume in ganjiang river basin china the outputs of two global climate models bnu esm and bcc csm1 1 are statistically downscaled by daily bias correction dbc method and used as inputs of the xinanjiang hydrological model to simulate streamflow during 1966 2099 projections for future flood 2020 2099 under representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 scenario are divided into two 40 year horizons 2040s 2080s and a comparison is made between these time horizons and the baseline 1966 2005 univariate flood frequency analysis indicates that there is a considerable increase in the magnitude and frequency of flood under the rcp8 5 scenario especially for the higher return periods the bivariate quantile curves under different levels of joint return period jrp for historical and future periods are derived by copula functions and the most likely realizations are estimated it is found that climate change has heavier impacts on the future joint bivariate quantiles for larger return periods finally the adaptive isolines and most likely flood quantiles under a jrp are derived from analyzing the merged series by non stationary copula based models the results highlight that the joint probability illustrated by the isoline of a given jrp varies significantly over time when non stationary models are applied this study incorporates the impacts of climate change on bivariate flood quantiles and develops an adaptive quantile estimation approach which may provide useful information for the references of flood risk assessment and management under changing environment keywords climate change bivariate analysis copula function flood frequency analysis ganjiang river basin 1 introduction changes in the climate are presently taking place due to the high greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere according to the fifth assessment report ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 spatial patterns of projected temperature and precipitation show large increases over land particularly over high latitude regions of the northern hemisphere increase in temperature and precipitation can significantly affect flood dynamics and change to flood characteristics has great impacts on various water resources sectors including flood protection reservoir management ecosystem etc hence it is of great importance to assess characteristics of extreme events such as floods in the context of changing climate to enable appropriate adaptation strategies global climate models gcms based on mathematical representations of atmosphere ice cap ocean and land surface processes are considered to be the most comprehensive and dependable tools available to generate information about current and future climate for various greenhouse gases and aerosols concentration scenarios ipcc 2014 swansburg et al 2004 as ones of the gcms the bcc csm1 1 developed by beijing climate center in china meteorological administration and the bnu esm developed by beijing normal university in china have been currently popular used over china due to their good performance in reproducing observed climate variations in china in recent decades for example xin et al 2013 showed that the bcc csm1 1 has good capability in reproducing the time evolutions of mean surface air temperature over china ji et al 2014 demonstrated that the bnu esm enables successfully simulating many observed features of the earth climate system in china such as the climatological annual cycle of surface air temperature and precipitation annual cycle of tropical pacific sea surface temperature etc wang et al 2016 verified that the bcc csm1 1 associating with statistical downscaling simulates the precipitation and temperature well in the ganjiang river basin ma et al 2016 employed the bnu esm to reproduce the precipitation and temperature in historical period and verified its good performance in the xiangjiang river basin the assessment of climate impacts at the local to regional scale usually requires the use of downscaling methods to translate large scale gcm outputs to regionally more relevant scales chen et al 2011 the downscaling methods contain statistical downscaling and dynamic downscaling i e regional climate models rcms techniques durman et al 2001 themeßl et al 2010 previous studies have proved that the statistical downscaling methods have advantages of inexpensive computation efficiency over dynamic downscaling e g xu 1999 wilby et al 2002 mpelasoka and chiew 2009 chen et al 2013a b shen et al 2018 for the statistical downscaling approaches the bias correction methods are widely used for the ease of implementation and relatively good performance themeßl et al 2010 teng et al 2012 ahmadalipour et al 2018 zhuan et al 2018 chen et al 2013a proposed a daily bias correction dbc approach which is a hybrid method combing the local intensity scaling method schmidli et al 2006 and the daily translation method mpelasoka and chiew 2009 to correct both the wet day frequency and the distribution of wet day precipitation several authors have successfully employed the dbc method to correct the gcm raw outputs and verified its good performance e g chen et al 2013b zhang et al 2017 shen et al 2018 zhuan et al 2018 over the past decade a limited number of studies focusing on the projected changes to flood characteristics have been conducted and most of these are within a univariate flood frequency analysis framework e g prudhomme et al 2002 booij 2005 das et al 2011 huziy et al 2013 tofiq and guven 2014 2015 meaurio et al 2017 the univariate frequency analysis is unable to describe the probability of occurrence for the flood event which is generally characterized by multivariate variables such as flood peak and volumes e g shiau 2003 yin et al 2018 therefore multivariate flood frequency analysis is essential for better understanding of projected changes to flood characteristics until now only a very few studies address the multivariate characteristics of flood events under changing climate for example jeong et al 2014 evaluated climate change impacts on three spring flood characteristics i e flood peak volume and duration within a bivariate framework for 21 northeast canadian basins covering québec and some parts of the adjoining ontario and newfoundland provinces of canada duan et al 2016 explored the variations of flood frequency in the huai river basin under different climate change scenarios by fitting univariate distribution as well as copula function the influence of the expected changes on multivariate flood frequency curve and joint design floods will significantly affect dam safety in the future and the adaptive flood quantiles will provide rich information as the references for flood risk assessment and is essential for future water resources design and management however how to derive the adaptive flood quantiles under changing environment has been rarely investigated the aim of the paper is to investigate the impacts of climate change on flood quantiles of flood peak and volume within a bivariate framework and to derive adaptive bivariate flood quantiles by non stationary copula approaches for the ganjiang river basin in china the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 is devoted to copulas and bivariate analysis method section 3 introduces observed and simulated data and their processing in the ganjiang river basin in section 4 the application of the adaptive flood quantile estimation procedure is analyzed and discussed at last the paper ends with the conclusions 2 methodology the flowchart of adaptive flood quantile estimation procedure is given in fig 1 on which there are three modules the climate projection module generates the future climate conditions by two gcms bcc csm1 1 and bnu esm and the precipitation and temperature data are statistically downscaled into basin scale the hydrological module simulates and projects future flow discharge using the xinanjiang hydrological model the bivariate analysis module compares the projections between the future and historical floods within bivariate framework and then derives the projected isolines and most likely flood quantiles under non stationary models by time varying moment method 2 1 general copulas and bivariate return period this study focuses on flood peak and volume to investigate the joint probability of flood occurrence the copula function a promising mathematical tool proposed by nelsen 1999 2006 is found versatile for constructing joint distribution functions as it allows modeling the dependence structure among random variables independently of the marginal distributions salvadori and de michele 2004 favre et al 2004 every joint distribution can be written in terms of a copula and its univariate marginal distributions let f xi x i i 1 2 n be the marginal cumulative density functions cdfs of x i the multivariate probability distribution h is expressed in terms of its marginal distributions and the associated dependence function known as sklar s theorem sklar 1959 1 c θ f x 1 x 1 f x 2 x 2 f x n x n h x 1 x 2 x n x 1 x 2 x n where c called copula is uniquely determined whenever f xi x i are continuous and captures the essential features of the dependence among the random variables θ is the parameter of copula in the conventional univariate analysis flood events of interest are often defined by return periods in the bivariate domain however it is still discussed by the community which method is most suitable to transform the joint exceedance probability to a bivariate joint return period jrp different jprs estimated by copula functions have been developed for the case of a bivariate flood frequency analysis eight types of possible joint events were presented by salvadori and de michele 2004 using or and and operators in which two cases are of the greatest interest in hydrological applications shiau 2003 salvadori and de michele 2004 yin et al 2017 2018 1 or case either q q or w w i e 2 e or q q or w w 2 and case both q q and w w i e 3 e and q q and w w in simple words for e or to happen it is sufficient that either flood peak discharge q or flood volume w or both exceed given thresholds instead for e and to happen it is necessary that both q and w are larger than prescribed values hence two different jrps can be defined accordingly de michele et al 2005 4 t or μ p q q o r w w μ 1 f q w 5 t and μ p q q a n d w w μ 1 f q q f w w f q w where μ is the mean inter arrival time between two consecutive events and f q w p q q w w moreover different definitions of the multivariate return period are available in literature based on regression analysis bivariate conditional distributions survival kendall distribution function and structure performance function a comprehensive review of the jrp estimation methods was given by de michele et al 2013 volpi and fiori 2014 and salvadori et al 2016 and references therein in this study the bivariate phenomenon being studied for q and w is defined based on eq 4 in the case of annual maxima μ 1 year 2 2 parametric and nonparametric estimation methods prior to conduct the bivariate analysis it is necessary to find the best fit marginal and joint distribution functions hence a set of parametric and nonparametric estimation methods are evaluated in this study 2 2 1 parametric estimation methods in this study five widely used parametric distributions i e lognormal gamma gumbel generalized extreme value gev and pearson type iii p iii are used for fitting q and w series the parameters of marginal distribution functions are estimated using l moments lm method hosking 1990 the first four orders of lms can be defined by probability weighted moments pwms as 6 λ 1 β 0 λ 2 2 β 1 β 0 λ 3 6 β 2 6 β 1 β 0 λ 4 20 β 3 30 β 2 12 β 1 β 0 in which β r denotes the pwms defined as greenwood et al 1979 7 β r 0 1 x f f r d f different families of copula functions have been proposed and described by nelsen 2006 the archimedean family is an associative class of copulas which allows modeling dependence in arbitrarily high dimensions with only one parameter nelsen 2006 the archimedean family is more desirable for hydrological analyses because it can be easily constructed and applied to whether the correlation among the hydrological variables is positive or negative yin et al 2017 three one parameter archimedean copulas including the gumbel hougaard g h frank and clayton copulas have been applied in flood frequency analysis by many authors e g shiau 2003 zhang and singh 2006 requena et al 2016 and thus are selected as the candidates in modeling the bivariate dependence between q and w for estimating the copula parameter θ the most common used method is the kendall correlation coefficient bender et al 2014 xu et al 2016 and is adopted in this study 2 2 2 nonparametric estimation method for the parametric estimation methods the flood data series are assumed to be drawn from a known distribution however the probability distribution is never known in practice guo and kachroo 1996 poulin et al 2007 the nonparametric estimation method which does not require the assumption of any distribution is used and compared with the parametric estimation methods the marginal probability density function pdf for q and w series is estimated using a nonparametric kernel density method that incorporates a weighted moving average of the empirical frequency distribution scott 1992 given a set of observations x 1 x n a univariate kernel density estimator is expressed as 8 f x 1 nh i 1 n k x x i h where k is the kernel function n is the number of observations and h is the bandwidth that controls the variance of the kernel function the choice of the bandwidth h is an important issue in estimating the pdf because the kernel estimator is highly sensitive to bandwidth adamowski 1985 guo and kachroo 1996 vittal et al 2015 to asymptotically optimize h an overall measure of the effectiveness of f x is provided by minimizing the mean integrated squared error mise which is given as follow bowman and azzalini 1997 9 mise e f x f x 2 d x 1 4 h 4 α k 4 f x 2 d x 1 nh α where α k 2 x d x and α k 2 denotes the variance of kernel function x 2 k x d x the bivariate kernel density estimator can be established in a manner similar to that of the univariate kernel a product of the univariate kernel functions is used to expand the kernel density estimators to the bivariate distributions with a set of bandwidths h x h y the joint distribution is estimated as silverman 1986 vittal et al 2015 10 f x y 1 n h x h y i 1 n k x x i h x k y y i h y where x i y i are the bivariate observations h x h y are the bandwidths in the x and y directions respectively the mise for the bivariate kernel case is expressed as follows silverman 1986 11 mise 1 4 h 4 α 2 2 f x y 2 d x d y 1 n h 2 β where α xyk x y d x d y β k x y 2 d x d y and 2 is the laplace operator the optimal bandwidth for a bivariate kernel is also obtained by minimizing the mise in this study the gaussian distribution is selected as the kernel function since it has been widely employed in fitting flood series and demonstrates good performance e g adamowski 1985 silverman 1986 vittal et al 2015 the optimal bandwidth is obtained following the general form proposed by bowman and azzalini 1997 2 3 non stationary extreme value theory in a bivariate framework non stationarity can emerge in the statistical attributes of the univariate variables and or in the dependence structure of the variables to capture the possible non stationary property of the marginal distributions the adaptive flood quantiles are derived by employing time or meteorological variables as covariates in the non stationary framework and incorporating the statistical downscaling of future meteorological covariates from gcms the non stationary flood series are evaluated using the time varying moment method which is built under the generalized additive models in location scale and shape gamlss framework rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 for the time varying moment of three parameter distributions f x x t μ t σ t κ t at time t t 1 2 n both the location parameter μ t scale parameter σ t and shape parameter κ t can be expressed as a linear or non linear function of the explanatory variables e j t j 1 2 m through the monotonic link functions given by 12 g μ t α 10 j 1 m α 1 j e j t g σ t α 20 j 1 m α 2 j e j t g v t α 30 j 1 m α 3 j e j t where g is the monotonic link function which is determined by the domain of the statistical parameter θ x i e if θ x r g θ x θ x r indicates real set or if θ x 0 g θ x l n θ x m is number of explanatory variables e j t indicates the j th explanatory variables at time t and α ij i 1 2 3 j 0 1 m are the gamlss parameters 2 4 non stationary copula functions to model temporal changes of the dependence between hydrological variables the copula parameter θ is substituted by the time dependent copula parameter θ c t as shown in table 1 similar to a univariate distribution the parameters of a copula are assumed to be functions of an explanatory variable time or meteorological variables to define a non stationary copula based on the definition of a copula the non stationary bivariate copula of flood peak and volume can be described as following 13 f t q t w t c f q t q θ q t f w t w θ w t θ c t where f t q t w t indicates the time varying joint distribution of q and w series f q t f w t and θ q t θ w t represents the time varying cdfs and parameters for q and w data series respectively similarly those parameters of a non stationary copula are expressed as the following linear function of the explanatory variables 14 g c θ c t β 0 j 1 m β j e j t where g c is a link function of the copula if θ c t r for frank copula g c θ c t θ c t or if θ c t 0 for g h and clayton copulas g c θ c t ln θ c t β 0 β 1 β m are the gamlss parameters the parameters of the time varying marginal and joint distributions are estimated by the imf method proposed by joe 2005 2 5 non stationary most likely event selection on isoline the critical level curve shown in fig 2 is defined as bivariate quantile curve under the or jrp the function that describes the level curve for any given jrp t or or critical probability level p has two asymptotes q qp and w wp where q p f q 1 p and w p f w 1 p are the marginal distribution quantiles for a given probability level p according to eq 4 in the bivariate case the choice of an appropriate jrp t or will lead to infinite combinations of q and w in the isoline even though all points on a p level curve have the same joint probability the different likelihood of each point must be taken into account to select appropriate design scenarios salvadori et al 2011 chebana and ouarda 2011 segmented the p level curve into a central part i e the subset ef in fig 2 and a tail part by employing its geometric properties salvadori et al 2011 proposed the novel concept of most likely design realization to choose the point with the highest likelihood along the p level curve volpi and fiori 2012 defined the distance of each point along the quantile curve from its vertex as random variable and derive its pdf then derived the confidence interval of the conditional distribution as well as the central part despite the fact that the advancement of central part contributes to explore the inherent law of hydrology unique design quantiles under one certain standard are necessary for engineering practice xu et al 2016 proposed the conditional most likely combination cmlc method and conditional expectation combination cec method to describe the dependence between flood peak and volumes by using the conditional density function to measure the occurrence likelihood of flood events in which the cmlc and cec methods are only suitable for univariate conditional return period in this study the most likely design realization method proposed by salvadori et al 2011 is applied in the non stationary data series and derived as follows 1 the non stationary joint distribution function f t q t w t is expressed in terms of its marginal functions f q t q and f w t w by using an associated non stationary copula function c i e f t q w c θ t u v and u f q t q v f w t w 2 for a given jrp the corresponding p level curve can be obtained by solving eq 13 and then the most likely flood event q t w t of all possible events at this level is derived by selecting the point with the largest joint probability density 15 q t w t arg max f t q w c θ t f q t q f w t w f q t q f w t w c θ t f q t q f w t w 1 1 t or t 1 2 n where f t q w is a non stationary joint pdf of q and w c θ t d c θ t u v d u d v is the density function of copula for non stationary data series f q t q and f w t w are the pdf of f q t q and f w t w respectively 3 the lagrange multiplier method chen and singh 2018 is applied for solving eq 15 to obtain the most likely realization along the level curve for a given jrp t or the lagrange function is constructed as below 16 φ t q w c θ t f q t q f w t w f q t q f w t w λ t c θ t f q t q f w t w 1 1 t or where λ t is the lagrange multiplier at time t 4 the first order derivative equals to zero will reach the maximum value and the following equation should be satisfied 17 φ q t f w t w c u t f q t 2 q c θ t u v f q t q λ t c θ t f q t q f

t w is the derivative function of f qt q and f wt w respectively the nonlinear eq 17 can be solved by numerical methods such as the harmonic mean newton s method özban 2004 3 case study 3 1 basin the ganjiang river basin shown in fig 3 a tributary basin of the yangtze river is located between 24 48 29 07 n and 113 67 116 65 e central south china with a total area of 80948 km2 and total length of 766 km the river originates in southwestern jiangxi province and runs into the southern plains finally falling into the yangtze river the ganjiang river is the largest river among the five that flow into poyang lake and the other four rivers are fu xin rao and xiu rivers poyang lake is the largest fresh water lake in china and the water from the poyang lake flows through the outlet to yangtze river in the north the five rivers are all within the poyang lake watershed as the water level in the poyang lake is influenced by the five rivers as well as the yangtze river the seasonal variation of water level and discharge create a unique landscape of fresh water lake wetland ecosystem the poyang lake wetland is among one of the major habitats of global importance for wintering migratory birds hu et al 2007 hence the ganjiang river located in the southern part of poyang lake watershed it plays a vital role in supplying water to support poyang lake s ecological environment this basin spans four latitudes and the natural head of mainstream reaches 937 m a s l which results in inhomogeneous spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation the mean annual precipitation in the whole ganjiang river basin is 1540 mm while the mean annual precipitation in middle ganjiang river basin is 1413 mm due to such distribution characteristics of precipitation heavy rainstorms rarely occurred in the jian taihe basin and southern ganjiang river in the recent 50 years the basin has a typical subtropical humid monsoon climate and the mean annual temperature is 17 8 c the highest and lowest temperatures are 39 5 c and 5 8 c respectively 3 2 data observed daily precipitation and temperature data of 11 meteorological stations in the ganjiang river basin from 1966 to 2005 were obtained from china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc cma gov cn index jsp and these stations are evenly distributed over the ganjiang river basin as shown in fig 3 in addition observed daily pan evaporation data at nanchang tonggu and meigang stations and flow discharge data at waizhou station during 1966 2005 were collected from the hydrology and water resources bureau of jiangxi province china waizhou hydrological station is the outlet of ganjiang river basin whose discharge represents the properties of the characteristics of hydrological regime fig 4 a shows that the runoff is concentrated during spring march april and may and summer june july and august seasons at the waizhou station the annual maximum peak discharge q trend during 1966 2005 is extracted and drawn in fig 4b and non significant decreasing trend is detected by the mann kendall test mann 1945 ma et al 2016 with the statistic zmk 0 43 compared to the critical value of z 1 α 2 1 96 at the α 5 significance level only a few low intensity snowfalls occurred during 1966 2005 and they all happened in winter so the impact of snowmelt on summer floods is neglect in the ganjiang river basin temperature and precipitation are two meteorological variables that are closely related to streamflow and are chosen as potential covariates for investigating the climate flood relationship the basin average meteorological series are obtained by aggregating the observed data of different stations over the watershed using thiessen polygon method then the annual total precipitation and annual average temperature series denoted by prep and temp respectively over the period of 1966 2005 are extracted fig 4c d reveal that q has much higher dependence on prep than temp and the correlation between q and prep is significant at 5 significance level considering all the observed floods occurred in spring and summer see fig 4b total precipitation and average temperature during these two seasons denoted by prep sp temp sp and prep su temp su respectively are also examined regression plots between the observed flood series and seasonal meteorological variables fig 4e h indicate that seasonal statistics have lower correlation coefficients comparing with annual statistics except that the temp su has stronger relation than temp overall the pearson correlation coefficient between q and prep with the value of 0 62 significantly overweigh the other five variables the climate model simulations were taken from the database of phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 database two gcms i e the bcc csm1 1 and the bnu esm under representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 scenario were selected in this study these two gcms have the same horizontal resolution 2 8 lat 2 8 long and four grid points were chosen to include all areas with noticeable influence on the circulation patterns that govern climate in the ganjiang river basin the precipitation and temperature data from gcm simulations are aggregated over the watershed to obtain the basin average series using the thiessen polygon method fig 3 also presents the thiessen polygon derived from the gcm grid points and the representative ratio of each grid point is also denoted the outputs of the bcc csm1 1 and bnu esm gcms consist of daily precipitation and temperature during 1966 2099 the future periods 2020 2099 are divided into two parts near future 2020 2059 2040s and far future 2060 2099 2080s while the simulations of historical period 1966 2005 of the two gcms are served as a reference for future projection and change 3 3 statistical downscaling of gcm outputs as introduced above gcm outputs are too coarse to directly drive a hydrological model for impact studies and so the downscaling technique must be utilized in this study an empirical statistical downscaling method i e daily bias correction dbc approach proposed by chen et al 2013a b is applied to deal with the systematic errors of gcms raw basin average precipitation and temperature data the dbc is a hybrid method combining the daily translation dt and local intensity scaling loci methods the loci method is first employed to correct the precipitation occurrence for a particular month e g january in the reference period a wet day threshold is determined from the gcm to ensure that the threshold exceedance equals the observed wet day frequency for that month the threshold is applied to the future period to correct the gcm s precipitation in corresponding month the dt method is then employed to correct the frequency distributions of precipitation amounts and temperatures this dbc method takes advantage of the loci method to correct precipitation occurrence instead of applying the same factor to each daily precipitation e g the loci method for a specific month it modulates the change as a function of the daily precipitation amount or temperature based on quantile differences in the frequency distribution of precipitation or temperature for the observed data to implement the dt method a distribution mapping technique is used to establish a relationship between the observed precipitation p obs q or temperature t obs q at different percentiles and the gcm simulated data p gcm r e f q t gcm r e f q for a specific month at the reference period the ratios of precipitation and temperature between observed and gcm simulated data at the reference period are calculated for each percentile the adjusted daily precipitation p adj f u t d for the future period can be obtained by multipling the percentile ratio and the adjusted daily temperature t adj f u t d for the future period can be derived by adding the percentile ratio as following chen et al 2013a shen et al 2018 18 p adj f u t d p gcm f u t d p obs q p gcm r e f q 19 t adj f u t d t gcm f u t d t obs q t gcm r e f q where the subscript q refers to a percentile for a specific month and the subscript d refers to a specific day in the future period the observed basin average meteorological data of the ganjiang river watershed during 1966 2005 are used as a baseline to correct each gcm the dbc method calibrated in the reference period is then used to correct the bias of precipitation and temperature for future periods to evaluate the performance of dbc method fig 5 presents the monthly and annual differences between each baseline projection and observed data for precipitation and mean temperature under two gcms the raw projections are denoted as bnu esm raw and bcc csm1 1 raw respectively while the gcm simulations after employing the dbc method are denoted as bnu esm corrected and bcc csm1 1 corrected respectively fig 5 indicates that the two gcms before bias correction both tend to simulate temperature maximum difference is 0 54 c better than precipitation maximum difference is 42 at annual and monthly scale since extreme climate events potentially also have impacts on floods than average values six extreme precipitation indices epis including magnitude r95p and r90n intensity rx5day and sdii and persistence cdd and cwd are selected to assess the capacity of dbc method to simulate the characteristics of extreme precipitation more interpretations about the epis can be found in wang et al 2016 the values of epis are presented as box plots in fig 6 which shows the median cross mean square 25th and 75th percentiles box and 5th and 95th percentiles whisker fig 6 reveals that the simulated epis corrected by dbc method are significantly closer to those of the observed values the largest differences of monthly temperature for two gcms are 0 19 c and the difference of monthly precipitation ranges from 8 6 7 3 hence the dbc method can correct the bias of gcm outputs successfully and use to project future precipitations and temperatures 3 4 runoff simulation and projection zhao et al 1980 proposed the xinanjiang hydrological model and verified the model by using long term hydrological and climatological data all over china the xinanjiang model is a lumped hydrological model and the main characteristic of this model is the theory of runoff formation on repletion of storage which means that runoff is not generated until the soil moisture content reaches field capacity the xinanjiang model has been widely and successfully applied in the humid and semi humid climate regions zhao 1992 lin et al 2014 the model inputs are the basin average precipitation and pan evaporation and the model outputs include the actual evapotranspiration and flow discharge at the outlet of the basin in this study daily hydrological and meteorological data series from 1966 to 1995 and 1996 2005 were used for calibration and verification respectively the rosenbrock method rosenbrock 1960 was used to optimize the parameter values the estimated parameters of xinanjiang model and their explanations are listed in table 2 the mean values of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient and relative error re are 87 68 and 85 32 4 26 and 5 86 during calibration and validation periods respectively the observed and simulated discharge hydrographs as well as the annual maximum flood peak and 7 day volume are shown in fig 7 results demonstrate that the xinanjiang model is able to simulate discharge and reproduce flood events with high nse low re values and high determination coefficient r 2 the bcc csm1 1 and bnu esm outputs under rcp8 5 scenario with bias correction were employed to simulate the daily precipitation and temperature during 1966 2099 and then used as the inputs of the calibrated xinanjiang model to project future flow discharge since the future pan evaporation data cannot be directly measured it is usually calculated using evaporation estimation methods based on climatic data varying from simple empirical formulations to complex physically based methods taylor 2012 in this study the temperature based methods suggested in practice xu and singh 2001 wang et al 2016 are employed the daily average pan evaporation ep t is an approximately exponential function of daily average air temperature t t which is given by wang et al 2016 20 ep t a exp b t t where a and b are coefficients determined by the least square method the regression analysis results between the observed mean annual daily pan evaporation and temperature during 1966 2005 in the ganjiang river basin are shown in fig 8 the values of determination coefficient r2 is over 0 93 which indicates that eq 20 is reasonable for estimating daily evaporation in this region therefore the pan evaporation can be estimated by downscaled temperature through the regression eq 20 and then used as inputs of xinanjiang model 4 results and discussions 4 1 projected changes to precipitation temperature and discharge to detect the long term variation of climate data in the ganjiang river basin the nonparametric mann kendall m k method is employed to examine the trends in the climate data and selected epis series during 1966 2099 fig 9 shows the zmk statistics for different climate variables and indices and the x axis represents the 13 variables or indices following the order in table 3 fig 9 indicates a significant increasing trend of bias corrected annual mean precipitation under bcc csm1 1 while the increasing trend of bnu esm is not significant at 5 significance level fig 9 and table 3 indicate that a significant increase of temperature is predominant for two gcms with 23 9 and 21 0 increase respectively during 2080s implying that the ganjiang river basin is projected to become warmer in the future the r95p and r90n decrease by 3 4 and 2 8 respectively and subsequently increase during 2080s under bnu esm outputs the changes of the r95p and r90n indices represent extreme precipitation percentiles showing a consistent significant increase under bcc csm1 1 this may imply that the magnitude of extreme precipitation tends to increase under rcp 8 5 scenario as an indicator of flood producing events the future rx5day under bcc csm1 1 increases gradually while bnu esm projects an increase until the end of 21st century after a 1 3 decrease during 2040s which pose a threat to the safety of flood control in this basin a general increase of sdii is projected under two gcms except for a slight decrease of 0 9 during 2040s under bnu esm overall there is a trend of centralized precipitation in this basin under rcp8 5 cdd and cwd indicate extreme precipitation persistence with cdd relating to drought and cwd relating to flood projected significant increase of cdd in the future ranges from 11 4 32 7 and 13 7 22 0 for bnu esm and bcc csm1 1 respectively indicating increasing risks of consecutive dry days which is consistent with the decreasing trend of streamflow in dry seasons i e autumn september october and november and winter december january and february meanwhile cwd is projected to slightly decrease in the 2040s and then significantly increase by 14 7 in the latter 21st century under bnu esm while a consistent increasing trend of cwd is found under bcc csm1 1 this may imply that the ganjiang river basin will probably experience more sudden changes from droughts to floods in the future under rcp8 5 projected changes in annual and seasonal mean streamflow during future periods 2040s and 2080s in the ganjiang river basin are illustrated in table 3 showing that the streamflow will be concentrated during spring and summer under two gcms which is the same as observation series table 3 also projects a general increasing trend of streamflow in annual spring and summer scales these projections are consistent with meteorological change while the increasing annual temperature precipitation magnitude indices r95p r90n and intensity indices rx5day sdii both projects a general moister and warmer climate in the future 4 2 fitting marginal and joint distributions the annual maximum am sampling method was used to obtain the annual maximum flood peak q and annual maximum 7 day flood volume w for the historical and future flood scenarios respectively it is noted that the volume associated with the peak discharge are definitely annual maximums which might be independent of the peak flow event xu et al 2016 table 4 demonstrates root mean square error rmse akaike information criterion aic and kolmogorov smirnov k s statistic d ks for parametric and nonparametric estimation methods it is evident that all the distributions can pass the k s test because d ks d 0 05 however the p iii distribution shows good performance than other distributions in most cases while gamma distribution and nonparametric methods perform better in two cases to ease the implementation of comparing climate change on flood quantiles only the optimal parametric and nonparametric methods are employed to estimate flood quantiles for different periods the frequency curves shown in fig 10 reveal that the nonparametric method is not sensitive to data type and could be effectively used for a well estimate of the floods for example during 2040s period the parametric method fails to capture the outlier flood data extreme wet year in 2056 of bcc csm1 1 while the nonparametric approach estimation is very close to the data series however the nonparametric approach does not have a theoretical distribution and may have certain limitations for extrapolating especially when the sample size is small the pearson kendall and spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the dependence between q and w for observation historical and future periods and their estimated values are listed in table 5 it is shown that the mutually correlated nature of q and w for observed and projected scenarios is clearly visible which supports the necessity for bivariate flood frequency analysis the copula parameter and statistical test results are listed in table 6 which indicates that the g h copula has the smallest rmse aic and d ks values hence the g h copula is selected for modeling the dependence between the q and w for both the historical and future periods 4 3 univariate analysis of historical and projected scenarios for different return periods t 100 75 50 20 10 5 year the corresponding quantiles of q and w for observation historical and projected scenarios are estimated based on the optimal parametric and nonparametric methods and listed in table 7 it can be noticed from table 7 that two gcms simulates extreme floods well during the historical period the differences between the parametric and nonparametric methods are not as large as two different gcms from table 7 parametric and nonparametric methods yield the similar conclusion i e there are increasing tendency toward changes for projections of future flood characteristics except a little decrease occurred in 2040s for bnu esm during 2080s two gcms project that q and w increase by 12 1 42 4 and 11 6 37 4 under return periods higher than 50 year respectively this might be a signal of changes in the climate for that area toward moister climate based on the bnu esm and bcc csm1 1 under rcp 8 5 scenario table 7 also indicates that the variability increases with the return period and the q have larger increments than w these may imply that the climate change has heavier impacts on q than w and larger flood events are likely to happen in future for ganjiang river basin under rcp 8 5 scenario 4 4 bivariate analysis of historical and projected scenarios fig 11 demonstrates the bivariate quantile curves for historical and future periods under the selected g h copula the observations and gcms projected flood events are also shown in fig 11 in order to obtain a rough estimation of their magnitude in the bivariate context for the historical and 2080s periods the largest flood events are located below the t or 100 year curve while one outlier flood projection over t or 100 year curve happened for both two gcms during 2040s the most likely design realization method is used to estimate q and w joint quantiles and the estimation results are presented in table 8 similar to the univariate analysis the differences of observation and historical floods are not so noticeable and the estimation differences between parametric and nonparametric method is lower than those of different gcms comparing the estimated quantiles in tables 7 and 8 it is found that the univariate estimators are smaller than the bivariate ones this is due to the fact that the conventional univariate methods usually lead to underestimation for or jrp or over estimation for and jrp fig 11 and table 8 show that there is an obvious increase for the higher return periods for example the parametric analysis indicate that the q and w increase by 12 5 42 5 under 100 year jrp during 2080s while increase by 0 9 22 7 under 5 year jrp these results imply that the joint quantile corresponding to larger return periods will be affected more by climate change than those corresponding to small return periods under bnu esm and bcc csm1 1 which the change may increase future flood risks in ganjiang river basin the change to floods is consistent with the general increasing trend of magnitude indices r95p and r90n and intensity indices rx5day and sdii analyzed in section 4 1 4 5 adaptive bivariate flood quantile estimation the q and w series during 1965 2099 are plotted in fig 12 and results of the m k trend test are denoted on each plot significant increasing trends are detected by the m k test for two gcms at 5 significance level the nonparametric pettitt test pettitt 1979 is applied to investigate the presence of abrupt changes for both q and w according to the results of the pettitt test the q and w under bcc csm1 1 both present a significant abrupt change in 2022 and the bnu esm gcm show a significant abrupt change in 2070 these preliminary analyses just demonstrate that both q and w under two gcms are non stationary which supports the necessity of non stationary analysis for the merged series under climate change the non stationary marginal and copula functions are fitted using time varying moment method under the gamlss framework to find the best fit non stationary model three precipitation variables prep prep sp and prep su as well as time are selected as candidate explanatory variables while temperature is excluded as it has little correlation with flood in this study three two parameter distributions i e lognormal gamma and gumbel and two three parameter distributions i e gev and p iii that widely used in modelling flood data are considered as candidates considering that the shape parameter κ of p iii and gev distributions is quite sensitive we assumed it to be constant as other studies did e g leclerc and ouarda 2007 bender et al 2014 um et al 2017 for the ease of parameter estimation and avoiding over parameterization three archimedean copulas i e g h frank and clayton copula are selected as the candidates in modeling the time varying dependence between flood peak and volume the non stationary models with the smallest aic values are selected and demonstrated in table 9 which shows that the prep is the best explanatory for all the variables in this study we focus exemplarily on events with a 50 year jrp because in general events with lower jrps are of interests for hydrological engineering practice and have small uncertainties of extrapolation bender et al 2014 fig 13 shows the evolution of the ensemble of isolines under 50 year jrp during 1966 2099 for the sake of comparison the 50 year isolines derived from the merged series during 1965 2099 using stationary method are also given in fig 13 which reveals that the isolines cross each other and cover a broad range for example under bnu esm the 50 year isolines covering a range with marginal q and w values ranging from 19157 m3 s to 27495 m3 s and 96 108m3 to 165 108m3 respectively it is also shown that there is one high outlier isoline for bcc csm1 1 gcm this is due to the fact that an outlier large flood occurs in the extreme wet year 2056 as shown in fig 13 next we focus on the development of the most likely events where the joint probability densities have their maximum values on each isoline derived by solving eq 17 fig 14 illustrates the time dependent development of both q and w showing that the larger floods occurred when the annual total precipitation prep is heavier this is reasonable due to the explanatory variables for the optimal non stationary models are chosen as prep figs 13 and 14 both show that the joint probability and flood quantile vary significantly over time when non stationary models are applied fig 14 indicates that the values of quantile q range from 21690 m3 s in 1966 to 27104 m3 s in 2099 or 25 0 increase under bnu esm and the largest flood 27496 m3 s occurs in extreme wet year of 2059 the flood peak quantile has wider range under bcc csm1 1 than that of bnu esm and the q range from 18580 m3 s to 31550 m3 s the changes to flood are consistent to the increasing trend of prep for example prep increases from 1338 mm in 1966 to 1775 mm in 2099 by 32 7 under bnu esm to compare the projected changes by the non stationary method table 10 lists the average adaptive bivariate flood quantiles and the relative difference rd with stationary estimations during historical and future periods under 50 year jrp the two gcms both show a positive trend and that in most years the design flood peaks are far larger than the stationary estimations the temporal evolution of the design values of w is similar as described for q these findings imply that climate change have large impacts on the future flood characteristics under rcp 8 5 scenario and large uncertainty and risks of the flood hazard should be taken into considerations for future engineering design 5 conclusions climate change is expected to have an effect on future storm characteristics and the change should properly be taken into account when evaluating future flood characteristics this study evaluated the flood quantiles of peak discharge and volume for the current 1966 2005 and future 2020 2099 periods in the ganjiang river basin using univariate and copula based bivariate frequency analysis methods the mutually correlated nature of flood peak and volumes visible clearly in the simulated flood events under both bnu esm and bcc csm1 1 gcms supports the necessity for bivariate flood frequency analysis the adaptive flood quantiles under 50 year jrp were derived using the non stationary most likely event selection method by employing time varying moment method the main results are summarized as follows 1 from univariate analysis of historical and rcp 8 5 projected scenarios two gcms both indicate that a signal of changes in the climate for the ganjiang river basin toward moister climate under the 8 5 scenario during 2080s two gcms projects that the flood peak and 7 day flood volume increase by 12 1 42 4 and 11 6 37 4 under return periods higher than 50 year respectively 2 in case of bivariate analysis there is a considerable increase for the higher return periods for the rcp 8 5 scenario for the period 2080s the flood peak and 7 day flood volume increase by 12 5 42 5 under 100 year jrp while increase by 0 9 22 7 under 5 year jrp it is shown that the joint quantiles corresponding to larger return periods will be affected more by climate change than those corresponding to small return periods under two gcms 3 the adaptive isolines and most likely events under 50 year jrp are derived from analyzing the merged series by non stationary copula based models the results reveal that the isolines cross each other and cover a broad range climate change has considerable impacts on the future bivariate flood quantiles and thus the resulting uncertainty and risks of the flood hazard should be taken into consideration for engineering design and water resources management in general the above findings have highlighted the importance of considering the climate change and non stationary in the bivariate flood quantile estimation however only two gcms and one statistical downscaling method have been employed to project future streamflow since the impact of climate change on floods is the comprehensive outcome we should take consideration of the uncertainty of gcms and downscaling methods in the future work also this study only focuses on bivariate framework multivariate analysis of flood peak volume and duration considering integrated uncertainties under climate change needs further research acknowledgements this study is financially supported by the

6926,climate change will lead to great impacts on flood frequency curve and design floods in the future however traditional hydrologic approaches often fail to analyze the flood characteristics within a bivariate framework under changing environment moreover previous studies investigating bivariate characteristics of flood usually do not derive the adaptive flood quantiles this study assesses the implications of climate change for future bivariate quantiles of flood peak and volume in ganjiang river basin china the outputs of two global climate models bnu esm and bcc csm1 1 are statistically downscaled by daily bias correction dbc method and used as inputs of the xinanjiang hydrological model to simulate streamflow during 1966 2099 projections for future flood 2020 2099 under representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 scenario are divided into two 40 year horizons 2040s 2080s and a comparison is made between these time horizons and the baseline 1966 2005 univariate flood frequency analysis indicates that there is a considerable increase in the magnitude and frequency of flood under the rcp8 5 scenario especially for the higher return periods the bivariate quantile curves under different levels of joint return period jrp for historical and future periods are derived by copula functions and the most likely realizations are estimated it is found that climate change has heavier impacts on the future joint bivariate quantiles for larger return periods finally the adaptive isolines and most likely flood quantiles under a jrp are derived from analyzing the merged series by non stationary copula based models the results highlight that the joint probability illustrated by the isoline of a given jrp varies significantly over time when non stationary models are applied this study incorporates the impacts of climate change on bivariate flood quantiles and develops an adaptive quantile estimation approach which may provide useful information for the references of flood risk assessment and management under changing environment keywords climate change bivariate analysis copula function flood frequency analysis ganjiang river basin 1 introduction changes in the climate are presently taking place due to the high greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere according to the fifth assessment report ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 spatial patterns of projected temperature and precipitation show large increases over land particularly over high latitude regions of the northern hemisphere increase in temperature and precipitation can significantly affect flood dynamics and change to flood characteristics has great impacts on various water resources sectors including flood protection reservoir management ecosystem etc hence it is of great importance to assess characteristics of extreme events such as floods in the context of changing climate to enable appropriate adaptation strategies global climate models gcms based on mathematical representations of atmosphere ice cap ocean and land surface processes are considered to be the most comprehensive and dependable tools available to generate information about current and future climate for various greenhouse gases and aerosols concentration scenarios ipcc 2014 swansburg et al 2004 as ones of the gcms the bcc csm1 1 developed by beijing climate center in china meteorological administration and the bnu esm developed by beijing normal university in china have been currently popular used over china due to their good performance in reproducing observed climate variations in china in recent decades for example xin et al 2013 showed that the bcc csm1 1 has good capability in reproducing the time evolutions of mean surface air temperature over china ji et al 2014 demonstrated that the bnu esm enables successfully simulating many observed features of the earth climate system in china such as the climatological annual cycle of surface air temperature and precipitation annual cycle of tropical pacific sea surface temperature etc wang et al 2016 verified that the bcc csm1 1 associating with statistical downscaling simulates the precipitation and temperature well in the ganjiang river basin ma et al 2016 employed the bnu esm to reproduce the precipitation and temperature in historical period and verified its good performance in the xiangjiang river basin the assessment of climate impacts at the local to regional scale usually requires the use of downscaling methods to translate large scale gcm outputs to regionally more relevant scales chen et al 2011 the downscaling methods contain statistical downscaling and dynamic downscaling i e regional climate models rcms techniques durman et al 2001 themeßl et al 2010 previous studies have proved that the statistical downscaling methods have advantages of inexpensive computation efficiency over dynamic downscaling e g xu 1999 wilby et al 2002 mpelasoka and chiew 2009 chen et al 2013a b shen et al 2018 for the statistical downscaling approaches the bias correction methods are widely used for the ease of implementation and relatively good performance themeßl et al 2010 teng et al 2012 ahmadalipour et al 2018 zhuan et al 2018 chen et al 2013a proposed a daily bias correction dbc approach which is a hybrid method combing the local intensity scaling method schmidli et al 2006 and the daily translation method mpelasoka and chiew 2009 to correct both the wet day frequency and the distribution of wet day precipitation several authors have successfully employed the dbc method to correct the gcm raw outputs and verified its good performance e g chen et al 2013b zhang et al 2017 shen et al 2018 zhuan et al 2018 over the past decade a limited number of studies focusing on the projected changes to flood characteristics have been conducted and most of these are within a univariate flood frequency analysis framework e g prudhomme et al 2002 booij 2005 das et al 2011 huziy et al 2013 tofiq and guven 2014 2015 meaurio et al 2017 the univariate frequency analysis is unable to describe the probability of occurrence for the flood event which is generally characterized by multivariate variables such as flood peak and volumes e g shiau 2003 yin et al 2018 therefore multivariate flood frequency analysis is essential for better understanding of projected changes to flood characteristics until now only a very few studies address the multivariate characteristics of flood events under changing climate for example jeong et al 2014 evaluated climate change impacts on three spring flood characteristics i e flood peak volume and duration within a bivariate framework for 21 northeast canadian basins covering québec and some parts of the adjoining ontario and newfoundland provinces of canada duan et al 2016 explored the variations of flood frequency in the huai river basin under different climate change scenarios by fitting univariate distribution as well as copula function the influence of the expected changes on multivariate flood frequency curve and joint design floods will significantly affect dam safety in the future and the adaptive flood quantiles will provide rich information as the references for flood risk assessment and is essential for future water resources design and management however how to derive the adaptive flood quantiles under changing environment has been rarely investigated the aim of the paper is to investigate the impacts of climate change on flood quantiles of flood peak and volume within a bivariate framework and to derive adaptive bivariate flood quantiles by non stationary copula approaches for the ganjiang river basin in china the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 is devoted to copulas and bivariate analysis method section 3 introduces observed and simulated data and their processing in the ganjiang river basin in section 4 the application of the adaptive flood quantile estimation procedure is analyzed and discussed at last the paper ends with the conclusions 2 methodology the flowchart of adaptive flood quantile estimation procedure is given in fig 1 on which there are three modules the climate projection module generates the future climate conditions by two gcms bcc csm1 1 and bnu esm and the precipitation and temperature data are statistically downscaled into basin scale the hydrological module simulates and projects future flow discharge using the xinanjiang hydrological model the bivariate analysis module compares the projections between the future and historical floods within bivariate framework and then derives the projected isolines and most likely flood quantiles under non stationary models by time varying moment method 2 1 general copulas and bivariate return period this study focuses on flood peak and volume to investigate the joint probability of flood occurrence the copula function a promising mathematical tool proposed by nelsen 1999 2006 is found versatile for constructing joint distribution functions as it allows modeling the dependence structure among random variables independently of the marginal distributions salvadori and de michele 2004 favre et al 2004 every joint distribution can be written in terms of a copula and its univariate marginal distributions let f xi x i i 1 2 n be the marginal cumulative density functions cdfs of x i the multivariate probability distribution h is expressed in terms of its marginal distributions and the associated dependence function known as sklar s theorem sklar 1959 1 c θ f x 1 x 1 f x 2 x 2 f x n x n h x 1 x 2 x n x 1 x 2 x n where c called copula is uniquely determined whenever f xi x i are continuous and captures the essential features of the dependence among the random variables θ is the parameter of copula in the conventional univariate analysis flood events of interest are often defined by return periods in the bivariate domain however it is still discussed by the community which method is most suitable to transform the joint exceedance probability to a bivariate joint return period jrp different jprs estimated by copula functions have been developed for the case of a bivariate flood frequency analysis eight types of possible joint events were presented by salvadori and de michele 2004 using or and and operators in which two cases are of the greatest interest in hydrological applications shiau 2003 salvadori and de michele 2004 yin et al 2017 2018 1 or case either q q or w w i e 2 e or q q or w w 2 and case both q q and w w i e 3 e and q q and w w in simple words for e or to happen it is sufficient that either flood peak discharge q or flood volume w or both exceed given thresholds instead for e and to happen it is necessary that both q and w are larger than prescribed values hence two different jrps can be defined accordingly de michele et al 2005 4 t or μ p q q o r w w μ 1 f q w 5 t and μ p q q a n d w w μ 1 f q q f w w f q w where μ is the mean inter arrival time between two consecutive events and f q w p q q w w moreover different definitions of the multivariate return period are available in literature based on regression analysis bivariate conditional distributions survival kendall distribution function and structure performance function a comprehensive review of the jrp estimation methods was given by de michele et al 2013 volpi and fiori 2014 and salvadori et al 2016 and references therein in this study the bivariate phenomenon being studied for q and w is defined based on eq 4 in the case of annual maxima μ 1 year 2 2 parametric and nonparametric estimation methods prior to conduct the bivariate analysis it is necessary to find the best fit marginal and joint distribution functions hence a set of parametric and nonparametric estimation methods are evaluated in this study 2 2 1 parametric estimation methods in this study five widely used parametric distributions i e lognormal gamma gumbel generalized extreme value gev and pearson type iii p iii are used for fitting q and w series the parameters of marginal distribution functions are estimated using l moments lm method hosking 1990 the first four orders of lms can be defined by probability weighted moments pwms as 6 λ 1 β 0 λ 2 2 β 1 β 0 λ 3 6 β 2 6 β 1 β 0 λ 4 20 β 3 30 β 2 12 β 1 β 0 in which β r denotes the pwms defined as greenwood et al 1979 7 β r 0 1 x f f r d f different families of copula functions have been proposed and described by nelsen 2006 the archimedean family is an associative class of copulas which allows modeling dependence in arbitrarily high dimensions with only one parameter nelsen 2006 the archimedean family is more desirable for hydrological analyses because it can be easily constructed and applied to whether the correlation among the hydrological variables is positive or negative yin et al 2017 three one parameter archimedean copulas including the gumbel hougaard g h frank and clayton copulas have been applied in flood frequency analysis by many authors e g shiau 2003 zhang and singh 2006 requena et al 2016 and thus are selected as the candidates in modeling the bivariate dependence between q and w for estimating the copula parameter θ the most common used method is the kendall correlation coefficient bender et al 2014 xu et al 2016 and is adopted in this study 2 2 2 nonparametric estimation method for the parametric estimation methods the flood data series are assumed to be drawn from a known distribution however the probability distribution is never known in practice guo and kachroo 1996 poulin et al 2007 the nonparametric estimation method which does not require the assumption of any distribution is used and compared with the parametric estimation methods the marginal probability density function pdf for q and w series is estimated using a nonparametric kernel density method that incorporates a weighted moving average of the empirical frequency distribution scott 1992 given a set of observations x 1 x n a univariate kernel density estimator is expressed as 8 f x 1 nh i 1 n k x x i h where k is the kernel function n is the number of observations and h is the bandwidth that controls the variance of the kernel function the choice of the bandwidth h is an important issue in estimating the pdf because the kernel estimator is highly sensitive to bandwidth adamowski 1985 guo and kachroo 1996 vittal et al 2015 to asymptotically optimize h an overall measure of the effectiveness of f x is provided by minimizing the mean integrated squared error mise which is given as follow bowman and azzalini 1997 9 mise e f x f x 2 d x 1 4 h 4 α k 4 f x 2 d x 1 nh α where α k 2 x d x and α k 2 denotes the variance of kernel function x 2 k x d x the bivariate kernel density estimator can be established in a manner similar to that of the univariate kernel a product of the univariate kernel functions is used to expand the kernel density estimators to the bivariate distributions with a set of bandwidths h x h y the joint distribution is estimated as silverman 1986 vittal et al 2015 10 f x y 1 n h x h y i 1 n k x x i h x k y y i h y where x i y i are the bivariate observations h x h y are the bandwidths in the x and y directions respectively the mise for the bivariate kernel case is expressed as follows silverman 1986 11 mise 1 4 h 4 α 2 2 f x y 2 d x d y 1 n h 2 β where α xyk x y d x d y β k x y 2 d x d y and 2 is the laplace operator the optimal bandwidth for a bivariate kernel is also obtained by minimizing the mise in this study the gaussian distribution is selected as the kernel function since it has been widely employed in fitting flood series and demonstrates good performance e g adamowski 1985 silverman 1986 vittal et al 2015 the optimal bandwidth is obtained following the general form proposed by bowman and azzalini 1997 2 3 non stationary extreme value theory in a bivariate framework non stationarity can emerge in the statistical attributes of the univariate variables and or in the dependence structure of the variables to capture the possible non stationary property of the marginal distributions the adaptive flood quantiles are derived by employing time or meteorological variables as covariates in the non stationary framework and incorporating the statistical downscaling of future meteorological covariates from gcms the non stationary flood series are evaluated using the time varying moment method which is built under the generalized additive models in location scale and shape gamlss framework rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 for the time varying moment of three parameter distributions f x x t μ t σ t κ t at time t t 1 2 n both the location parameter μ t scale parameter σ t and shape parameter κ t can be expressed as a linear or non linear function of the explanatory variables e j t j 1 2 m through the monotonic link functions given by 12 g μ t α 10 j 1 m α 1 j e j t g σ t α 20 j 1 m α 2 j e j t g v t α 30 j 1 m α 3 j e j t where g is the monotonic link function which is determined by the domain of the statistical parameter θ x i e if θ x r g θ x θ x r indicates real set or if θ x 0 g θ x l n θ x m is number of explanatory variables e j t indicates the j th explanatory variables at time t and α ij i 1 2 3 j 0 1 m are the gamlss parameters 2 4 non stationary copula functions to model temporal changes of the dependence between hydrological variables the copula parameter θ is substituted by the time dependent copula parameter θ c t as shown in table 1 similar to a univariate distribution the parameters of a copula are assumed to be functions of an explanatory variable time or meteorological variables to define a non stationary copula based on the definition of a copula the non stationary bivariate copula of flood peak and volume can be described as following 13 f t q t w t c f q t q θ q t f w t w θ w t θ c t where f t q t w t indicates the time varying joint distribution of q and w series f q t f w t and θ q t θ w t represents the time varying cdfs and parameters for q and w data series respectively similarly those parameters of a non stationary copula are expressed as the following linear function of the explanatory variables 14 g c θ c t β 0 j 1 m β j e j t where g c is a link function of the copula if θ c t r for frank copula g c θ c t θ c t or if θ c t 0 for g h and clayton copulas g c θ c t ln θ c t β 0 β 1 β m are the gamlss parameters the parameters of the time varying marginal and joint distributions are estimated by the imf method proposed by joe 2005 2 5 non stationary most likely event selection on isoline the critical level curve shown in fig 2 is defined as bivariate quantile curve under the or jrp the function that describes the level curve for any given jrp t or or critical probability level p has two asymptotes q qp and w wp where q p f q 1 p and w p f w 1 p are the marginal distribution quantiles for a given probability level p according to eq 4 in the bivariate case the choice of an appropriate jrp t or will lead to infinite combinations of q and w in the isoline even though all points on a p level curve have the same joint probability the different likelihood of each point must be taken into account to select appropriate design scenarios salvadori et al 2011 chebana and ouarda 2011 segmented the p level curve into a central part i e the subset ef in fig 2 and a tail part by employing its geometric properties salvadori et al 2011 proposed the novel concept of most likely design realization to choose the point with the highest likelihood along the p level curve volpi and fiori 2012 defined the distance of each point along the quantile curve from its vertex as random variable and derive its pdf then derived the confidence interval of the conditional distribution as well as the central part despite the fact that the advancement of central part contributes to explore the inherent law of hydrology unique design quantiles under one certain standard are necessary for engineering practice xu et al 2016 proposed the conditional most likely combination cmlc method and conditional expectation combination cec method to describe the dependence between flood peak and volumes by using the conditional density function to measure the occurrence likelihood of flood events in which the cmlc and cec methods are only suitable for univariate conditional return period in this study the most likely design realization method proposed by salvadori et al 2011 is applied in the non stationary data series and derived as follows 1 the non stationary joint distribution function f t q t w t is expressed in terms of its marginal functions f q t q and f w t w by using an associated non stationary copula function c i e f t q w c θ t u v and u f q t q v f w t w 2 for a given jrp the corresponding p level curve can be obtained by solving eq 13 and then the most likely flood event q t w t of all possible events at this level is derived by selecting the point with the largest joint probability density 15 q t w t arg max f t q w c θ t f q t q f w t w f q t q f w t w c θ t f q t q f w t w 1 1 t or t 1 2 n where f t q w is a non stationary joint pdf of q and w c θ t d c θ t u v d u d v is the density function of copula for non stationary data series f q t q and f w t w are the pdf of f q t q and f w t w respectively 3 the lagrange multiplier method chen and singh 2018 is applied for solving eq 15 to obtain the most likely realization along the level curve for a given jrp t or the lagrange function is constructed as below 16 φ t q w c θ t f q t q f w t w f q t q f w t w λ t c θ t f q t q f w t w 1 1 t or where λ t is the lagrange multiplier at time t 4 the first order derivative equals to zero will reach the maximum value and the following equation should be satisfied 17 φ q t f w t w c u t f q t 2 q c θ t u v f q t q λ t c θ t f q t q f w t w u f q t q 0 φ w t f q t q c v t f w t 2 w c θ t u v f w t w λ t c θ t f q t q f w t w v f w t w 0 φ λ t c θ t f q t q f w t w 1 1 t or 0 where c u t c θ t u v u c v t c θ t u v v f q t q and f w t w is the derivative function of f qt q and f wt w respectively the nonlinear eq 17 can be solved by numerical methods such as the harmonic mean newton s method özban 2004 3 case study 3 1 basin the ganjiang river basin shown in fig 3 a tributary basin of the yangtze river is located between 24 48 29 07 n and 113 67 116 65 e central south china with a total area of 80948 km2 and total length of 766 km the river originates in southwestern jiangxi province and runs into the southern plains finally falling into the yangtze river the ganjiang river is the largest river among the five that flow into poyang lake and the other four rivers are fu xin rao and xiu rivers poyang lake is the largest fresh water lake in china and the water from the poyang lake flows through the outlet to yangtze river in the north the five rivers are all within the poyang lake watershed as the water level in the poyang lake is influenced by the five rivers as well as the yangtze river the seasonal variation of water level and discharge create a unique landscape of fresh water lake wetland ecosystem the poyang lake wetland is among one of the major habitats of global importance for wintering migratory birds hu et al 2007 hence the ganjiang river located in the southern part of poyang lake watershed it plays a vital role in supplying water to support poyang lake s ecological environment this basin spans four latitudes and the natural head of mainstream reaches 937 m a s l which results in inhomogeneous spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation the mean annual precipitation in the whole ganjiang river basin is 1540 mm while the mean annual precipitation in middle ganjiang river basin is 1413 mm due to such distribution characteristics of precipitation heavy rainstorms rarely occurred in the jian taihe basin and southern ganjiang river in the recent 50 years the basin has a typical subtropical humid monsoon climate and the mean annual temperature is 17 8 c the highest and lowest temperatures are 39 5 c and 5 8 c respectively 3 2 data observed daily precipitation and temperature data of 11 meteorological stations in the ganjiang river basin from 1966 to 2005 were obtained from china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc cma gov cn index jsp and these stations are evenly distributed over the ganjiang river basin as shown in fig 3 in addition observed daily pan evaporation data at nanchang tonggu and meigang stations and flow discharge data at waizhou station during 1966 2005 were collected from the hydrology and water resources bureau of jiangxi province china waizhou hydrological station is the outlet of ganjiang river basin whose discharge represents the properties of the characteristics of hydrological regime fig 4 a shows that the runoff is concentrated during spring march april and may and summer june july and august seasons at the waizhou station the annual maximum peak discharge q trend during 1966 2005 is extracted and drawn in fig 4b and non significant decreasing trend is detected by the mann kendall test mann 1945 ma et al 2016 with the statistic zmk 0 43 compared to the critical value of z 1 α 2 1 96 at the α 5 significance level only a few low intensity snowfalls occurred during 1966 2005 and they all happened in winter so the impact of snowmelt on summer floods is neglect in the ganjiang river basin temperature and precipitation are two meteorological variables that are closely related to streamflow and are chosen as potential covariates for investigating the climate flood relationship the basin average meteorological series are obtained by aggregating the observed data of different stations over the watershed using thiessen polygon method then the annual total precipitation and annual average temperature series denoted by prep and temp respectively over the period of 1966 2005 are extracted fig 4c d reveal that q has much higher dependence on prep than temp and the correlation between q and prep is significant at 5 significance level considering all the observed floods occurred in spring and summer see fig 4b total precipitation and average temperature during these two seasons denoted by prep sp temp sp and prep su temp su respectively are also examined regression plots between the observed flood series and seasonal meteorological variables fig 4e h indicate that seasonal statistics have lower correlation coefficients comparing with annual statistics except that the temp su has stronger relation than temp overall the pearson correlation coefficient between q and prep with the value of 0 62 significantly overweigh the other five variables the climate model simulations were taken from the database of phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 database two gcms i e the bcc csm1 1 and the bnu esm under representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 scenario were selected in this study these two gcms have the same horizontal resolution 2 8 lat 2 8 long and four grid points were chosen to include all areas with noticeable influence on the circulation patterns that govern climate in the ganjiang river basin the precipitation and temperature data from gcm simulations are aggregated over the watershed to obtain the basin average series using the thiessen polygon method fig 3 also presents the thiessen polygon derived from the gcm grid points and the representative ratio of each grid point is also denoted the outputs of the bcc csm1 1 and bnu esm gcms consist of daily precipitation and temperature during 1966 2099 the future periods 2020 2099 are divided into two parts near future 2020 2059 2040s and far future 2060 2099 2080s while the simulations of historical period 1966 2005 of the two gcms are served as a reference for future projection and change 3 3 statistical downscaling of gcm outputs as introduced above gcm outputs are too coarse to directly drive a hydrological model for impact studies and so the downscaling technique must be utilized in this study an empirical statistical downscaling method i e daily bias correction dbc approach proposed by chen et al 2013a b is applied to deal with the systematic errors of gcms raw basin average precipitation and temperature data the dbc is a hybrid method combining the daily translation dt and local intensity scaling loci methods the loci method is first employed to correct the precipitation occurrence for a particular month e g january in the reference period a wet day threshold is determined from the gcm to ensure that the threshold exceedance equals the observed wet day frequency for that month the threshold is applied to the future period to correct the gcm s precipitation in corresponding month the dt method is then employed to correct the frequency distributions of precipitation amounts and temperatures this dbc method takes advantage of the loci method to correct precipitation occurrence instead of applying the same factor to each daily precipitation e g the loci method for a specific month it modulates the change as a function of the daily precipitation amount or temperature based on quantile differences in the frequency distribution of precipitation or temperature for the observed data to implement the dt method a distribution mapping technique is used to establish a relationship between the observed precipitation p obs q or temperature t obs q at different percentiles and the gcm simulated data p gcm r e f q t gcm r e f q for a specific month at the reference period the ratios of precipitation and temperature between observed and gcm simulated data at the reference period are calculated for each percentile the adjusted daily precipitation p adj f u t d for the future period can be obtained by multipling the percentile ratio and the adjusted daily temperature t adj f u t d for the future period can be derived by adding the percentile ratio as following chen et al 2013a shen et al 2018 18 p adj f u t d p gcm f u t d p obs q p gcm r e f q 19 t adj f u t d t gcm f u t d t obs q t gcm r e f q where the subscript q refers to a percentile for a specific month and the subscript d refers to a specific day in the future period the observed basin average meteorological data of the ganjiang river watershed during 1966 2005 are used as a baseline to correct each gcm the dbc method calibrated in the reference period is then used to correct the bias of precipitation and temperature for future periods to evaluate the performance of dbc method fig 5 presents the monthly and annual differences between each baseline projection and observed data for precipitation and mean temperature under two gcms the raw projections are denoted as bnu esm raw and bcc csm1 1 raw respectively while the gcm simulations after employing the dbc method are denoted as bnu esm corrected and bcc csm1 1 corrected respectively fig 5 indicates that the two gcms before bias correction both tend to simulate temperature maximum difference is 0 54 c better than precipitation maximum difference is 42 at annual and monthly scale since extreme climate events potentially also have impacts on floods than average values six extreme precipitation indices epis including magnitude r95p and r90n intensity rx5day and sdii and persistence cdd and cwd are selected to assess the capacity of dbc method to simulate the characteristics of extreme precipitation more interpretations about the epis can be found in wang et al 2016 the values of epis are presented as box plots in fig 6 which shows the median cross mean square 25th and 75th percentiles box and 5th and 95th percentiles whisker fig 6 reveals that the simulated epis corrected by dbc method are significantly closer to those of the observed values the largest differences of monthly temperature for two gcms are 0 19 c and the difference of monthly precipitation ranges from 8 6 7 3 hence the dbc method can correct the bias of gcm outputs successfully and use to project future precipitations and temperatures 3 4 runoff simulation and projection zhao et al 1980 proposed the xinanjiang hydrological model and verified the model by using long term hydrological and climatological data all over china the xinanjiang model is a lumped hydrological model and the main characteristic of this model is the theory of runoff formation on repletion of storage which means that runoff is not generated until the soil moisture content reaches field capacity the xinanjiang model has been widely and successfully applied in the humid and semi humid climate regions zhao 1992 lin et al 2014 the model inputs are the basin average precipitation and pan evaporation and the model outputs include the actual evapotranspiration and flow discharge at the outlet of the basin in this study daily hydrological and meteorological data series from 1966 to 1995 and 1996 2005 were used for calibration and verification respectively the rosenbrock method rosenbrock 1960 was used to optimize the parameter values the estimated parameters of xinanjiang model and their explanations are listed in table 2 the mean values of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient and relative error re are 87 68 and 85 32 4 26 and 5 86 during calibration and validation periods respectively the observed and simulated discharge hydrographs as well as the annual maximum flood peak and 7 day volume are shown in fig 7 results demonstrate that the xinanjiang model is able to simulate discharge and reproduce flood events with high nse low re values and high determination coefficient r 2 the bcc csm1 1 and bnu esm outputs under rcp8 5 scenario with bias correction were employed to simulate the daily precipitation and temperature during 1966 2099 and then used as the inputs of the calibrated xinanjiang model to project future flow discharge since the future pan evaporation data cannot be directly measured it is usually calculated using evaporation estimation methods based on climatic data varying from simple empirical formulations to complex physically based methods taylor 2012 in this study the temperature based methods suggested in practice xu and singh 2001 wang et al 2016 are employed the daily average pan evaporation ep t is an approximately exponential function of daily average air temperature t t which is given by wang et al 2016 20 ep t a exp b t t where a and b are coefficients determined by the least square method the regression analysis results between the observed mean annual daily pan evaporation and temperature during 1966 2005 in the ganjiang river basin are shown in fig 8 the values of determination coefficient r2 is over 0 93 which indicates that eq 20 is reasonable for estimating daily evaporation in this region therefore the pan evaporation can be estimated by downscaled temperature through the regression eq 20 and then used as inputs of xinanjiang model 4 results and discussions 4 1 projected changes to precipitation temperature and discharge to detect the long term variation of climate data in the ganjiang river basin the nonparametric mann kendall m k method is employed to examine the trends in the climate data and selected epis series during 1966 2099 fig 9 shows the zmk statistics for different climate variables and indices and the x axis represents the 13 variables or indices following the order in table 3 fig 9 indicates a significant increasing trend of bias corrected annual mean precipitation under bcc csm1 1 while the increasing trend of bnu esm is not significant at 5 significance level fig 9 and table 3 indicate that a significant increase of temperature is predominant for two gcms with 23 9 and 21 0 increase respectively during 2080s implying that the ganjiang river basin is projected to become warmer in the future the r95p and r90n decrease by 3 4 and 2 8 respectively and subsequently increase during 2080s under bnu esm outputs the changes of the r95p and r90n indices represent extreme precipitation percentiles showing a consistent significant increase under bcc csm1 1 this may imply that the magnitude of extreme precipitation tends to increase under rcp 8 5 scenario as an indicator of flood producing events the future rx5day under bcc csm1 1 increases gradually while bnu esm projects an increase until the end of 21st century after a 1 3 decrease during 2040s which pose a threat to the safety of flood control in this basin a general increase of sdii is projected under two gcms except for a slight decrease of 0 9 during 2040s under bnu esm overall there is a trend of centralized precipitation in this basin under rcp8 5 cdd and cwd indicate extreme precipitation persistence with cdd relating to drought and cwd relating to flood projected significant increase of cdd in the future ranges from 11 4 32 7 and 13 7 22 0 for bnu esm and bcc csm1 1 respectively indicating increasing risks of consecutive dry days which is consistent with the decreasing trend of streamflow in dry seasons i e autumn september october and november and winter december january and february meanwhile cwd is projected to slightly decrease in the 2040s and then significantly increase by 14 7 in the latter 21st century under bnu esm while a consistent increasing trend of cwd is found under bcc csm1 1 this may imply that the ganjiang river basin will probably experience more sudden changes from droughts to floods in the future under rcp8 5 projected changes in annual and seasonal mean streamflow during future periods 2040s and 2080s in the ganjiang river basin are illustrated in table 3 showing that the streamflow will be concentrated during spring and summer under two gcms which is the same as observation series table 3 also projects a general increasing trend of streamflow in annual spring and summer scales these projections are consistent with meteorological change while the increasing annual temperature precipitation magnitude indices r95p r90n and intensity indices rx5day sdii both projects a general moister and warmer climate in the future 4 2 fitting marginal and joint distributions the annual maximum am sampling method was used to obtain the annual maximum flood peak q and annual maximum 7 day flood volume w for the historical and future flood scenarios respectively it is noted that the volume associated with the peak discharge are definitely annual maximums which might be independent of the peak flow event xu et al 2016 table 4 demonstrates root mean square error rmse akaike information criterion aic and kolmogorov smirnov k s statistic d ks for parametric and nonparametric estimation methods it is evident that all the distributions can pass the k s test because d ks d 0 05 however the p iii distribution shows good performance than other distributions in most cases while gamma distribution and nonparametric methods perform better in two cases to ease the implementation of comparing climate change on flood quantiles only the optimal parametric and nonparametric methods are employed to estimate flood quantiles for different periods the frequency curves shown in fig 10 reveal that the nonparametric method is not sensitive to data type and could be effectively used for a well estimate of the floods for example during 2040s period the parametric method fails to capture the outlier flood data extreme wet year in 2056 of bcc csm1 1 while the nonparametric approach estimation is very close to the data series however the nonparametric approach does not have a theoretical distribution and may have certain limitations for extrapolating especially when the sample size is small the pearson kendall and spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the dependence between q and w for observation historical and future periods and their estimated values are listed in table 5 it is shown that the mutually correlated nature of q and w for observed and projected scenarios is clearly visible which supports the necessity for bivariate flood frequency analysis the copula parameter and statistical test results are listed in table 6 which indicates that the g h copula has the smallest rmse aic and d ks values hence the g h copula is selected for modeling the dependence between the q and w for both the historical and future periods 4 3 univariate analysis of historical and projected scenarios for different return periods t 100 75 50 20 10 5 year the corresponding quantiles of q and w for observation historical and projected scenarios are estimated based on the optimal parametric and nonparametric methods and listed in table 7 it can be noticed from table 7 that two gcms simulates extreme floods well during the historical period the differences between the parametric and nonparametric methods are not as large as two different gcms from table 7 parametric and nonparametric methods yield the similar conclusion i e there are increasing tendency toward changes for projections of future flood characteristics except a little decrease occurred in 2040s for bnu esm during 2080s two gcms project that q and w increase by 12 1 42 4 and 11 6 37 4 under return periods higher than 50 year respectively this might be a signal of changes in the climate for that area toward moister climate based on the bnu esm and bcc csm1 1 under rcp 8 5 scenario table 7 also indicates that the variability increases with the return period and the q have larger increments than w these may imply that the climate change has heavier impacts on q than w and larger flood events are likely to happen in future for ganjiang river basin under rcp 8 5 scenario 4 4 bivariate analysis of historical and projected scenarios fig 11 demonstrates the bivariate quantile curves for historical and future periods under the selected g h copula the observations and gcms projected flood events are also shown in fig 11 in order to obtain a rough estimation of their magnitude in the bivariate context for the historical and 2080s periods the largest flood events are located below the t or 100 year curve while one outlier flood projection over t or 100 year curve happened for both two gcms during 2040s the most likely design realization method is used to estimate q and w joint quantiles and the estimation results are presented in table 8 similar to the univariate analysis the differences of observation and historical floods are not so noticeable and the estimation differences between parametric and nonparametric method is lower than those of different gcms comparing the estimated quantiles in tables 7 and 8 it is found that the univariate estimators are smaller than the bivariate ones this is due to the fact that the conventional univariate methods usually lead to underestimation for or jrp or over estimation for and jrp fig 11 and table 8 show that there is an obvious increase for the higher return periods for example the parametric analysis indicate that the q and w increase by 12 5 42 5 under 100 year jrp during 2080s while increase by 0 9 22 7 under 5 year jrp these results imply that the joint quantile corresponding to larger return periods will be affected more by climate change than those corresponding to small return periods under bnu esm and bcc csm1 1 which the change may increase future flood risks in ganjiang river basin the change to floods is consistent with the general increasing trend of magnitude indices r95p and r90n and intensity indices rx5day and sdii analyzed in section 4 1 4 5 adaptive bivariate flood quantile estimation the q and w series during 1965 2099 are plotted in fig 12 and results of the m k trend test are denoted on each plot significant increasing trends are detected by the m k test for two gcms at 5 significance level the nonparametric pettitt test pettitt 1979 is applied to investigate the presence of abrupt changes for both q and w according to the results of the pettitt test the q and w under bcc csm1 1 both present a significant abrupt change in 2022 and the bnu esm gcm show a significant abrupt change in 2070 these preliminary analyses just demonstrate that both q and w under two gcms are non stationary which supports the necessity of non stationary analysis for the merged series under climate change the non stationary marginal and copula functions are fitted using time varying moment method under the gamlss framework to find the best fit non stationary model three precipitation variables prep prep sp and prep su as well as time are selected as candidate explanatory variables while temperature is excluded as it has little correlation with flood in this study three two parameter distributions i e lognormal gamma and gumbel and two three parameter distributions i e gev and p iii that widely used in modelling flood data are considered as candidates considering that the shape parameter κ of p iii and gev distributions is quite sensitive we assumed it to be constant as other studies did e g leclerc and ouarda 2007 bender et al 2014 um et al 2017 for the ease of parameter estimation and avoiding over parameterization three archimedean copulas i e g h frank and clayton copula are selected as the candidates in modeling the time varying dependence between flood peak and volume the non stationary models with the smallest aic values are selected and demonstrated in table 9 which shows that the prep is the best explanatory for all the variables in this study we focus exemplarily on events with a 50 year jrp because in general events with lower jrps are of interests for hydrological engineering practice and have small uncertainties of extrapolation bender et al 2014 fig 13 shows the evolution of the ensemble of isolines under 50 year jrp during 1966 2099 for the sake of comparison the 50 year isolines derived from the merged series during 1965 2099 using stationary method are also given in fig 13 which reveals that the isolines cross each other and cover a broad range for example under bnu esm the 50 year isolines covering a range with marginal q and w values ranging from 19157 m3 s to 27495 m3 s and 96 108m3 to 165 108m3 respectively it is also shown that there is one high outlier isoline for bcc csm1 1 gcm this is due to the fact that an outlier large flood occurs in the extreme wet year 2056 as shown in fig 13 next we focus on the development of the most likely events where the joint probability densities have their maximum values on each isoline derived by solving eq 17 fig 14 illustrates the time dependent development of both q and w showing that the larger floods occurred when the annual total precipitation prep is heavier this is reasonable due to the explanatory variables for the optimal non stationary models are chosen as prep figs 13 and 14 both show that the joint probability and flood quantile vary significantly over time when non stationary models are applied fig 14 indicates that the values of quantile q range from 21690 m3 s in 1966 to 27104 m3 s in 2099 or 25 0 increase under bnu esm and the largest flood 27496 m3 s occurs in extreme wet year of 2059 the flood peak quantile has wider range under bcc csm1 1 than that of bnu esm and the q range from 18580 m3 s to 31550 m3 s the changes to flood are consistent to the increasing trend of prep for example prep increases from 1338 mm in 1966 to 1775 mm in 2099 by 32 7 under bnu esm to compare the projected changes by the non stationary method table 10 lists the average adaptive bivariate flood quantiles and the relative difference rd with stationary estimations during historical and future periods under 50 year jrp the two gcms both show a positive trend and that in most years the design flood peaks are far larger than the stationary estimations the temporal evolution of the design values of w is similar as described for q these findings imply that climate change have large impacts on the future flood characteristics under rcp 8 5 scenario and large uncertainty and risks of the flood hazard should be taken into considerations for future engineering design 5 conclusions climate change is expected to have an effect on future storm characteristics and the change should properly be taken into account when evaluating future flood characteristics this study evaluated the flood quantiles of peak discharge and volume for the current 1966 2005 and future 2020 2099 periods in the ganjiang river basin using univariate and copula based bivariate frequency analysis methods the mutually correlated nature of flood peak and volumes visible clearly in the simulated flood events under both bnu esm and bcc csm1 1 gcms supports the necessity for bivariate flood frequency analysis the adaptive flood quantiles under 50 year jrp were derived using the non stationary most likely event selection method by employing time varying moment method the main results are summarized as follows 1 from univariate analysis of historical and rcp 8 5 projected scenarios two gcms both indicate that a signal of changes in the climate for the ganjiang river basin toward moister climate under the 8 5 scenario during 2080s two gcms projects that the flood peak and 7 day flood volume increase by 12 1 42 4 and 11 6 37 4 under return periods higher than 50 year respectively 2 in case of bivariate analysis there is a considerable increase for the higher return periods for the rcp 8 5 scenario for the period 2080s the flood peak and 7 day flood volume increase by 12 5 42 5 under 100 year jrp while increase by 0 9 22 7 under 5 year jrp it is shown that the joint quantiles corresponding to larger return periods will be affected more by climate change than those corresponding to small return periods under two gcms 3 the adaptive isolines and most likely events under 50 year jrp are derived from analyzing the merged series by non stationary copula based models the results reveal that the isolines cross each other and cover a broad range climate change has considerable impacts on the future bivariate flood quantiles and thus the resulting uncertainty and risks of the flood hazard should be taken into consideration for engineering design and water resources management in general the above findings have highlighted the importance of considering the climate change and non stationary in the bivariate flood quantile estimation however only two gcms and one statistical downscaling method have been employed to project future streamflow since the impact of climate change on floods is the comprehensive outcome we should take consideration of the uncertainty of gcms and downscaling methods in the future work also this study only focuses on bivariate framework multivariate analysis of flood peak volume and duration considering integrated uncertainties under climate change needs further research acknowledgements this study is financially supported by the

6927,evaluation of surface soil moisture is necessary to understand spatiotemporal soil moisture trends and their implications on water resources management this research evaluated a real time instantiation of nasa s land information system lis for water resources management applications at a higher spatial and temporal resolution than is currently available with remotely sensed satellite estimates or in situ measurements of the same product managed by nasa s short term prediction research and transition sport center the sport lis is an observation driven real time simulation of the noah land surface model at a 3 km resolution over the full continental united states surface soil moisture estimates from sport lis 0 10 cm layer were validated against in situ soil moisture from the international soil moisture network in the missouri and arkansas red white river basins validation was conducted at in situ measurement depths of 5 cm and 10 cm and performance was evaluated across varying soil types land cover depth slope aspect and pixel heterogeneity to determine conditions under which sport lis surface soil moisture had excellent estimation capability results demonstrate that 53 of data at a depth of 5 cm and 51 of the data at a depth of 10 cm were significantly correlated with a spearman s ρ greater than 0 5 on a daily basis based upon validation results it is evident that the sport lis surface soil moisture estimate is satisfactory for research and operational water resources management applications keywords soil moisture sport lis land surface model validation 1 introduction a thorough understanding of soil moisture across multiple spatiotemporal scales is essential for many applications including drought and flood prediction weather forecasting climatology agricultural production and water resources management an et al 2016 blankenship et al 2016 dobriyal et al 2012 fascetti et al 2016 griesfeller et al 2016 soil moisture has a significant impact on the partitioning of moisture for evapotranspiration and surface sensible and latent heat fluxes blankenship et al 2016 griesfeller et al 2016 and thus plays a major role in understanding land atmosphere interactions and climate change projections an et al 2016 griesfeller et al 2016 the european space agency identified soil moisture as one of the fifty essential climate variables in 2010 an et al 2016 griesfeller et al 2016 due to its role as a key variable in the characterization of the global climate fascetti et al 2016 with respect to water resources applications soil moisture plays an influential role within the hydrologic cycle due to its ability to control the rainfall runoff response in catchments dobriyal et al 2012 al shrafany et al 2014 alvarez garreton et al 2014

moisture is an important determinant of available water and can dictate productivity of natural and agricultural ecosystems dobriyal et al 2012 monitoring of soil moisture has proven useful for the allocation of limited water resources during drought coordinating relief efforts during floods and for preventing desertification moran et al 2004 dobriyal et al 2012 furthermore surface soil moisture is an important initial condition for hydrologic modeling meng et al 2017 li et al 2018 and flood forecasting alvarez garreton et al 2014 meng et al 2017 the assimilation of remotely sensed soil moisture has shown to improve streamflow prediction alvarez garreton et al 2014 brocca et al 2012 li et al 2018 and has demonstrated potential to advance short term flood forecasting meng et al 2017 soil moisture data across a range of scales is primarily obtained from in situ observations remotely sensed satellite observations and climate and land surface models xia et al 2015a in situ data provides a valuable point scale estimate of soil moisture that is useful for the evaluation of remotely sensed and modeled soil moisture albergel et al 2012 however dense ground based networks would be necessary to truly capture the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil moisture over large scales due to the high variability of soil properties precipitation and other physical and climatological factors that influence patterns of soil moisture dobriyal et al 2012 al shrafany et al 2014 in reality the availability of in situ soil moisture over large areas and long temporal periods is extremely limited which makes it makes it challenging to infer spatiotemporal patterns of soil moisture from in situ observations alone soil moisture derived from remote sensing platforms provides a promising avenue to examine the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture at larger scales satellite derived soil moisture observations have become a powerful tool that have enhanced our ability to understand land atmosphere processes griesfeller et al 2016 by providing global coverage at regular time intervals alvarez garreton et al 2014 a number of satellite missions have been launched for the purpose of global soil moisture observation including the advanced microwave sounding radiometer amsr e reichle et al 2007 the advanced scatterometer ascat wagner et al 1999 soil moisture ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2001 and soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 while these satellites enable the global observation of soil moisture in a way that was not previously possible with in situ measurements the ability of each satellite to accurately estimate soil moisture has proven to be variable over time and space brocca et al 2012 de jeu and dorigo 2016 the continuous increase of sensors and retrieval methods makes it difficult for the user community to understand what the exact quality of a soil moisture product is for a specific sensor and how it can be used in applications de jeu and dorigo 2016 furthermore there are serious limitations to many satellite derived soil moisture products which include the coarse spatial and temporal resolution of data and the capability to only measure the first few centimeters of soil from microwave sensors al shrafany et al 2014 alvarez garreton et al 2014 brocca et al 2012 cammalleri et al 2015 land surface models lsms provide a viable alternative to satellite derived soil moisture observations lsms enable simulation of soil moisture based upon forcing variables such as precipitation wind speed and physical properties such as soil texture and land cover koster et al 2009 blankenship et al 2016 a major advantage of model based soil moisture estimates is their ability to use real time or retrospective weather and climate information xia et al 2015a and provide estimates of soil moisture to several meters of depth at hourly daily and monthly time steps moran et al 2004 cammalleri et al 2015 the ability of different lsms to estimate soil moisture has been found comparable to in situ and remotely sensed soil moisture e g al shrafany et al 2014 srivastava et al 2015 fang et al 2016 however the reliability of model based soil moisture is heavily dependent on accurate surface forcing data and parameterization cammalleri et al 2015 yang et al 2016 koster et al 2009 xia et al 2015a regardless lsm derived soil moisture has tremendous potential to be useful in a variety of applications due to its capability to estimate soil moisture across the entire contiguous united states conus domain at high spatiotemporal resolutions this research examines the validity of lsm derived surface soil moisture for the purpose of surface water resources applications within the central united states surface soil moisture was obtained from sport lis which is an observation driven real time simulation of the unified noah lsm chen and dudhia 2001 ek et al 2003 the main objective of this research was to assess the ability of sport lis to provide reliable estimates of surface soil moisture for surface water resources operational and research applications through validation against in situ soil moisture in the missouri and arkansas red white river basins in the u s great plains region the sport lis software was selected for analysis due to its potential to provide accurate volumetric surface soil moisture estimates in real time at a higher spatial and temporal resolution than is currently provided by satellite observations or in situ measurements of the same product 2 materials methods 2 1 study area the missouri and arkansas red white river basins are located in the central united states and cover the majority of the u s great plains region fig 1 the area of the two basins combined equates to approximately 2 million square kilometers the study area encompasses ten climate regions as defined by the köppen geiger climate classification ranging from fully humid and temperate areas in the northeast to arid and dry zones in the southwest rubel and kottek 2010 there is a diverse gradient of rainfall across the study area with annual precipitation ranging from 200 mm in the west to 1000 mm in the east prism climate group 2015 3 in situ soil moisture data in situ soil moisture data was provided by the international soil moisture network ismn dorigo et al 2011 dorigo et al 2013 on a daily time scale from 2000 to 2016 the ismn is a global soil moisture database that compiles in situ data from operational partners around the world for validation of satellite observations and land surface models dorigo et al 2011 dorigo et al 2013 in situ soil moisture data is an invaluable source of information for calibration and validation of remotely sensed

and measurement errors have been thoroughly investigated e g dorigo et al 2013 gruber et al 2013 the measurement error of networks within the ismn ranges from 0 02 to 0 06 gruber et al 2013 with the average error for most networks estimated at 0 03 xia et al 2015a in situ soil moisture data was obtained for 165 stations within the missouri and arkansas red white river basins at depths of 5 cm and 10 cm fig 1 this data was maintained in ismn by five operational soil moisture networks table 1 any data that was flagged by the ismn as questionable dubious and did not receive a designation of g for good data was removed from the dataset and omitted from analysis 4 sport lis the nasa land information system lis is a high performance land surface modeling and data assimilation system that can be used to run a variety of lsms through the integration of satellite derived datasets ground based observations and model re analyses to characterize land surface states and fluxes kumar et al 2006 peters lidard et al 2007 lis can run lsms regionally or globally with a grid spacing as fine as one kilometer by using scalable high performance computing and data management technologies lis features an ensemble kalman filter algorithm evensen 2003 to conduct land surface data assimilation kumar et al 2008 kumar et al 2009 for a variety of datasets and variables such as soil moisture land surface temperature and snow e g liu et al 2013 the system also supports an optimization and uncertainty analysis for calibrating lsm parameters to observations santanello et al 2013 in addition to operating in an offline standalone mode lis has been coupled to the weather research and forecasting wrf model kumar et al 2007 for numerical weather prediction nwp research applications as part of the nasa unified wrf modeling framework peters lidard et al 2015 to enhance the land atmosphere interactions within wrf nasa s marshall space flight center s short term prediction research and transition sport center jedlovec 2013 has developed a real time application of the nasa lis for use in experimental operations by both domestic and international operational weather forecasters case 2016 case et al 2016 case and zavodsky 2018 zavodsky et al 2013 this software sport lis is an observation driven real time simulation of the unified noah lsm chen and dudhia 2001 ek et al 2003 over a full contiguous u s domain the sport lis provides soil moisture estimates at an approximately 3 km grid resolution over a 2 meter deep soil column detailed information regarding the input parameters and methodology that constitutes sport lis can be obtained from zavodsky et al 2016 and case and zavodsky 2018 the sport lis top layer volumetric soil moisture 0 10 cm estimate was selected for validation against in situ soil moisture data from ismn at depths of 5 and 10 cm sport lis soil moisture was obtained on a daily temporal scale from 2000 to 2016 for the continental united states and masked to the study area extent fig 1 5 validation the accuracy of soil moisture estimates from satellite platforms or lsms can vary by region and climate zone and thus it is important to conduct validation to determine an individual product s reliability within different areas of study wang et al 2016 there is currently no standard method of validation that dictates how remotely sensed products should be evaluated de jeu and dorigo 2016 however metrics commonly used to evaluate soil moisture derived from satellites and lsms include bias root mean square difference rmsd root mean square error rmse spearman s ranked correlation coefficient spearman s ρ and pearson s correlation coefficient albergel et al 2012 an et al 2016 fascetti et al 2016 the validation of remotely sensed data with in situ observations is not straightforward due to differences in spatial resolution observation depth and measurement uncertainty an et al 2016 xia et al 2015a the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the soil limits verification of remotely sensed soil moisture an et al 2016 blankenship et al 2016 furthermore this issue is confounded by differences in spatial resolution between measurement techniques the horizontal and vertical resolutions of in situ data and remotely sensed data are different draper et al 2009 xia et al 2015a xia et al 2015b for example in this research the sport lis soil moisture estimate has a 3 km horizontal spatial resolution at a vertical depth of 0 10 cm while the in situ soil moisture is a point scale measurement at independent depths of 5 cm and 10 cm these discrepancies in resolution between measurement techniques make the validation process complex furthermore in situ measurements may contain errors and therefore cannot be considered a true value of soil moisture albergel et al 2012 draper et al 2009 this study employed several different validation metrics and methods of assessment to assess the reliability of the sport lis volumetric surface soil moisture estimate compared to situ soil moisture data spearman s ρ rmse and bias were used to compare the sport lis surface soil moisture estimate 0 10 cm and in situ soil moisture data 5 and 10 cm depths from 2000 to 2016 spearman s ρ was used to assess the degree of similarity between sport lis soil moisture and in situ soil moisture while rmse was used to assess overall model error xia et al 2015a a measure of bias was used to assess model systematic error and evaluate possible over or under estimation of soil moisture xia et al 2015a as there is currently no standard method for evaluation of soil moisture estimates de jeu and dorigo 2016 past research was used as a guide to assign performance labels for assessing validation results previous work has established the comparison between remotely sensed or modeled soil moisture estimates against in situ data to be satisfactory when reporting correlation values of 0 42 wang et al 2016 0 53 0 70 albergel et al 2012 and 0 52 0 72 griesfeller et al 2016 in this study correlation values above 0 50 are considered to be satisfactory for research applications though values exceeding 0 75 are preferable for decision making practices moran et al 2004 validation performance was assessed on a daily basis to understand the ability of the sport lis soil moisture estimate to capture the daily variations in surface soil moisture analysis of daily soil moisture on a seasonal basis was conducted to evaluate short term variability albergel et al 2012 following albergel et al 2012 the seasons were defined as summer june july august fall september october november winter december january february and spring march april may the potential for frozen soils during the winter months will affect in situ soil moisture data xia et al 2015a especially in higher latitudes of the study area however the analysis of soil moisture over a yearlong period can provide invaluable information about annual and seasonal soil moisture trends for water resources management applications in addition there are numerous examples in the literature of annual and seasonal validation of soil moisture estimates e g albergel et al 2012 fascetti et al 2016 physical environmental characteristics such as soil texture and land cover strongly affect soil moisture xia et al 2015b thus the influence of physical environmental factors on the comparison between the sport lis soil moisture estimate and in situ data was analyzed using the kruskal wallis rank sum test only those values of spearman s ρ that were statistically significant i e p value 0 05 were utilized for this part of the analysis the physical environmental factors that were examined included land cover soil texture dominant hydrologic soil group slope and aspect land cover data was obtained from the 2011 national land cover dataset at 30 m resolution homer et al 2015 and soil data was acquired from the digital general soil map of the u s statsgo2 at a 1 250 000 resolution nrcs 2006 topographic data was obtained from the u s 3d elevation program 3dep at a 30 m resolution usgs 2016 this approach facilitated comparisons between the mean correlation value in regions of cropland for example and the mean correlation value in areas of forest cover to determine whether the validation performance varied between land cover types this statistical approach enabled identification of physical areas where the reliability of the sport lis soil moisture estimate might differ finally the tukey honest significant difference test was used to compare the validation performance between ground based measurement stations at depths of 5 cm and 10 cm to determine if the vertical resolution of measurement affected overall validation performance finally to account for discrepancies in spatial resolution between measurement techniques the shannon diversity index shdi was calculated and used to assess the influence of pixel heterogeneity across the 3 km grid on validation performance the shdi was determined using the fragstats software program which is a spatial pattern analysis program for categorical maps mcgarigal et al 2012 shdi was calculated to provide a value of heterogeneity across the 3 km grid for land cover soil texture and dominant hydrologic soil group using the 2011 national land cover dataset homer et al 2015 and statsgo2 nrcs 2006 this approach enabled evaluation of whether a high degree of heterogeneity in soil texture across a 3 km grid for example might affect the ability of sport lis to accurately estimate soil moisture when compared to ground based measurements thus this analysis enabled conclusions about the influence of discrepancies in measurement scale between remotely sensed and ground based soil moisture 6 results discussion 6 1 validation results the sport lis volumetric surface soil moisture estimate 0 10 cm was validated against in situ surface soil moisture on a daily basis at depths of 5 and 10 cm using spearman s ρ approximately 52 of points analyzed yielded a correlation value of greater than 0 5 figs 2 and 3 at depths of 5 cm and 10 cm 53 and 51 of the data returned a correlation value greater than 0 5 respectively in total and for both measurement depths the average and median correlation values were just below and above 0 5 table 2 validation metrics of bias and rmse were also calculated to assess reliability of the sport lis soil moisture estimate typical rmse values were at or below 0 1 table 2 which exceeds the typical measurement error 0 02 0 06 m3 m 3 of in situ data rmse values that surpass the corresponding in situ instrument measurement errors indicate that simulation errors are derived from model limitations such as inaccurate forcing data xia et al 2015a the average bias for both measurement depths was high though the median bias was much closer to zero with both values below ten table 2 these values of bias indicate that there may be overestimation of soil moisture by sport lis when compared to in situ data this result is consistent with previous analysis of the noah land surface model conducted by xia et al 2015a who reported that the high values of bias indicated that models and model forcings still have room to improve the combination of high bias and rmse values that exceed instrument measurement errors suggest that further refinement of the sport lis software may be necessary interestingly rmse and bias values for the 10 cm measurement depth were slightly lower than the 5 cm measurement depth which is likely due to less variability in soil moisture at the deeper 10 cm depth the sport lis soil moisture estimate was comparable on a daily basis to many of the ground based stations from 2000 to 2016 for example at the stillwater 5wnw ground measurement station fig 4 the pattern of the sport lis surface soil moisture estimates closely mirrored in situ soil moisture with a correlation value of 0 8544 however at this same location sport lis seemed to overestimate soil moisture during dry periods 0 0 3 m3 m 3 and slightly underestimate soil moisture during saturated soil conditions 0 3 m3 m 3 after examining validation data at several stations this same overestimation during dry conditions and underestimation during saturated soil conditions seemed common this could be attributed to multiple factors including misrepresentation of soil properties and or land cover characteristics at the in situ measurement station challenges associated with validating a 3 km grid cell against a point scale observation or model limitations on behalf of the sport lis software as discussed above to determine whether the sport lis soil moisture estimate demonstrated significant variability over the vertical soil profile the validation performance was further assessed by depth of the in situ measurement of the ground based measurements 101 stations had a soil moisture measurement depth of 5 cm while 132 stations reported soil moisture a depth of 10 cm in comparison the sport lis surface soil moisture estimate reflects a volumetric column depth from 0 to 10 cm the kruskal wallis test was used to statistically compare the mean spearman s ρ bias and rmse values at both depths of measurement while the results suggested that there was not a significant difference in the spearman s ρ p value 0 643 and bias p value 0 497 values a significant difference was found in the mean rmse values p value 0 009 between the two depths of measurement fig 5 this suggests that the sport lis surface soil moisture estimate had a slightly better fit with the in situ measurement at the 10 cm depth however from a practical perspective there is no substantial difference in the validation performance between the two depths of measurement as the magnitude of difference between the rmse values is small 0 012 therefore it is evident that the depth of the in situ measurement does not wield a substantial influence on the daily validation performance of sport lis 6 2 seasonal analysis the daily validation performance of the sport lis volumetric surface soil moisture estimate 0 10 cm against in situ surface soil moisture was assessed on a seasonal basis at depths of 5 and 10 cm using spearman s ρ seasonal analysis was conducted to assess how validation performance varied between the seasons throughout the year in general the seasonal validation performance at a depth of 5 cm was comparable to the overall validation performance with average spearman s ρ values above 0 4 for summer fall and winter table 3 however at the 10 cm depth only the summer and fall seasons exhibited an average spearman s ρ value above 0 4 at both depths the validation performance was highest and exhibited the least variability during the summer months which is consistent with xia et al 2015a who validated the noah lsm and demonstrated correlations that were larger in the summer months than in the winter season typical values of rmse throughout all four seasons were just above or below 0 1 which was consistent with the overall validation performance validation at depths of 10 cm consistently demonstrated lower rmse values than validation at the 5 cm depth table 3 the average bias was high for all four seasons which was also comparable to the overall validation performance though winter exhibited the highest values of average bias however values for median bias were at or below 10 for almost all of the seasons with the exception of summer 5 cm depth and winter 10 cm depth upon further examination validation performance in the winter season differed significantly between the 5 cm and 10 cm depth which is likely due to the occurrence of frozen soils at deeper depths during that period tukey s honest significant difference was used to statistically compare the validation performance between seasons at the 5 cm depth only a significant difference p value 0 0006 was found upon comparison of the mean spearman s ρ for spring against the same value for summer fig 6 though from a practical perspective the difference between the means in spring and summer is relatively small at a depth of 10 cm fig 7 however a significant difference was found between spring and fall p value 0 009 winter and fall p value 0 002 summer and spring p value 0 000 and winter and summer p value 0 000 the slightly lower validation performance in the spring and winter seasons particularly at the 10 cm depth could be attributed to the challenge of estimating soil moisture during periods of saturation in spring or frozen soils in winter this result reveals that on a seasonal basis the validation performance of sport lis soil moisture at the 10 cm depth is poor in comparison to the 5 cm depth due to the low spearman s ρ in the winter season therefore based upon both the daily and seasonal validation results the authors conclude that the sport lis soil moisture estimate is comparable with the in situ soil moisture measurements at the 5 cm depth throughout the year sport lis surface soil moisture is satisfactory for water resources applications though some caution should be applied when utilizing the soil moisture estimates within the spring months 6 3 physical environmental characteristics soil properties and land cover can substantially influence soil moisture and are important factors in water resources management xia et al 2015b thus the physical environmental characteristics at the location of each in situ measurement were assessed to evaluate the influence of environmental conditions surrounding the in situ measurement on validation performance soil texture dominant hydrologic soil group land cover aspect and slope were considered examination of the influence of soil texture on validation performance revealed no substantial influence of soil type at the in situ station on the validation performance of the sport lis soil moisture product fig 8 no significant difference among soil texture classes was found after comparing values of spearman s ρ p value 0 167 examination of the rmse values revealed a significant difference between the loam and sandy loam texture classes p value 0 029 which indicates that sport lis soil moisture had a slightly better fit with in situ measurements in loam soils compared to sandy loam soils silt loam and silty clay loam were found to be somewhat less biased than sandy loam though this comparison was not significant similar results were found at the 10 cm depth the dominant hydrologic soil group at the in situ measurement site was analyzed to assess its influence on validation performance hydrologic soil groups provide an estimate of runoff potential from low runoff potential group a to the highest runoff potential group d thus the dominant hydrologic soil group is the prevailing soil group within a specific area none of the comparisons between soil groups were found to be significantly different after comparing the spearman s ρ p value 0 103 rmse p value 0 421 or bias p value 0 0797 at either measurement depth fig 9 however some interesting patterns emerge in the results while not significant hydrologic soil group c demonstrates higher mean correlation values with lower rmse and bias when compared to group a which exhibits opposite patterns figs 9 and 10 this may indicate that sport lis is better suited in its current configuration for soil moisture estimation in poorly drained than in well drained soils however this difference could be due to the time lag between the time of a rainfall event and the time that the soil moisture measurement estimate was taken or mis characterization of soil properties at the in situ measurement site similar results were found at the 10 cm depth the land cover classification at the ground based monitoring stations was analyzed to assess its influence on validation performance of the sport lis soil moisture estimate the incorrect classification of land cover can potentially assign the wrong root zone depth or leaf area index within the model xia et al 2015b which will lead to inaccurate soil moisture estimates no significant difference p value 0 199 was found upon comparison of mean spearman s ρ values between land cover classes fig 11 however the evergreen forest land cover class exhibited significantly higher values of rmse p value 0 0112 when compared to cultivated crops and herbaceous land cover classes and displayed significant higher bias values p value 0 0115 when compared to hay pasture in general the forested land cover classes evergreen deciduous and mixed forest demonstrated poorer correlation performance higher rmse values and higher bias than other land cover classes though this difference is not significant other than the aforementioned performance of the evergreen forest class these results may be attributed to the high vegetation density of forested land cover classes which have been known to yield poor correlation results yang et al 2016 given their distribution on the taylor diagram the land cover classes of herbaceous pasture hay and cultivated crops appear to demonstrate the best overall fit fig 11 finally the influence of aspect and slope on the validation performance was evaluated through examination of the spearman s ρ rmse and bias values at each depth of measurement no significant trend was evident between either aspect nor slope and any of the validation metrics this suggests that neither aspect nor slope at this scale of resolution has any influence on validation performance 6 4 grid heterogeneity differences in measurement resolution can lead to errors in analysis especially with validation of remotely sensed data the sport lis surface soil moisture estimate is measured at a spatial resolution of 3 km while the in situ soil moisture data is a point based measurement soils and land cover can vary significantly across a 3 km grid and thus can influence the estimate from sport lis fig 12 to address whether this spatial scale mismatch wielded a substantial influence on validation performance each 3 km grid containing an in situ measurement point was examined to analyze the influence of grid heterogeneity on validation performance the program fragstats was used to calculate the shannon diversity index shdi for soil texture dominant hydrologic soil group and land cover classes a shdi value of zero represents completely homogeneous conditions and increases in value as the grid cell conditions become more heterogeneous the average and median shdi values for both soil texture and the hydrologic soil group were close to zero indicating mostly homogeneous soil conditions across the 3 km grid at all validation points table 4 land cover was much more heterogeneous with average and median shdi values approaching one results demonstrate that neither the heterogeneity of the hydrologic soil group soil texture or land cover had any significant effect on validation performance indicating that sport lis yields reasonable soil moisture estimates across the landscape 7 conclusion the objective of this study was to validate the sport lis volumetric surface soil moisture estimate 0 10 cm against in situ soil moisture observations across the missouri and arkansas red white river basins within the u s great plains and assess whether this estimate of soil moisture was suitable for water resources management applications the sport lis soil moisture estimate demonstrated satisfactory correlation with in situ data with 52 of validation points yielding a significant positive correlation and a spearman s ρ value greater than 0 5 on a daily basis analysis of validation performance on a seasonal basis revealed that soil moisture estimates in summer fall and winter were comparable to the overall validation at the 5 cm depth with spearman s ρ exceeding 0 4 for all seasons with the exception of spring however at the 10 cm depth spearman s ρ values only exceeded 0 4 during summer and fall thus it is evident that the sport lis surface soil moisture estimate is comparable with in situ soil moisture at a depth of 5 cm however caution should be applied when utilizing sport lis soil moisture estimates during the spring season due to the low correlation values the high values of bias and rmse values exceeding those of the in situ measurement error indicate that further refinement of the sport lis software may be necessary the influence of physical environmental characteristics including soil texture hydrologic soil group land cover aspect and slope were also analyzed to assess whether these factors exhibited any substantial effect on the validation while not statistically significant there was some indication that the sport lis soil moisture estimate may be most reliable for areas characterized by poorly drained soils e g hydrologic soil group c in addition forested land cover classes evergreen deciduous and mixed forest demonstrated poorer correlation performance higher rmse values and higher bias values than other land cover classes these results suggest that the sport lis soil moisture estimate might have a more difficult time capturing soil moisture fluxes in forested land which may be attributed to dense vegetation tree canopy and forest litter complicating the estimation of soil moisture in these areas however in general the majority of the environmental parameters that were examined failed to have a significant effect on the validation performance this is consistent with validation results of the noah lsm found by xia et al 2015b who demonstrated that utilization of site observed soil texture and vegetation type did not improve soil moisture simulations finally the heterogeneity of soil texture dominant hydrologic soil group and land cover across the 3 km grid at each validation point were analyzed to assess whether differences in spatial resolution of measurement points influenced validation performance in any way results show that heterogeneity of these three physical factors did not influence validation performance though these results may be attributed to the generally low measures of heterogeneity calculated for the validation locations further analysis using higher resolution land cover and soils data might be able to yield a better understanding of the effect of surface heterogeneity on the validation of remotely sensed soil moisture the results described here suggest that sport lis surface soil moisture estimates are comparable to in situ soil moisture at a measurement depth of 5 cm and that no physical environmental factors or discrepancy in measurement scale influenced the validation performance in any substantial way thus it is viable to conclude that the sport lis surface soil moisture estimate is satisfactory for research and operational water resources management applications within the missouri and arkansas red white river basins the ability to utilize soil moisture estimates with a high spatial and temporal resolution will be invaluable for analysis of spatiotemporal soil moisture patterns that will aid in the allocation of resources in drought periods prevent desertification and manage flood situations soil moisture estimates from sport lis may also be useful for assimilation in hydrologic modeling and flood forecasting applications future considerations to improve sport lis soil moisture may include the assimilation of satellite data such as from smap or smos as the assimilation of passive microwave data into lsms is known to improve soil moisture estimation yang et al 2016 data assimilation can be used to update lsms by combining model states with observations of state variables to provide an updated model analysis superior to either data source alone using satellite data blankenship et al 2016 future research may investigate the influence of anthropogenic inputs such as irrigation on in situ soil moisture as this type of phenomenon is not currently captured in the lsm simulation the validation of root zone soil moisture estimates from sport lis in future examinations of the software would also prove valuable for additional water resources applications acknowledgements this work was partially supported by the kansas nasa epscor partnership development grant nnx15ak36a r51357 6 and k state research

6927,evaluation of surface soil moisture is necessary to understand spatiotemporal soil moisture trends and their implications on water resources management this research evaluated a real time instantiation of nasa s land information system lis for water resources management applications at a higher spatial and temporal resolution than is currently available with remotely sensed satellite estimates or in situ measurements of the same product managed by nasa s short term prediction research and transition sport center the sport lis is an observation driven real time simulation of the noah land surface model at a 3 km resolution over the full continental united states surface soil moisture estimates from sport lis 0 10 cm layer were validated against in situ soil moisture from the international soil moisture network in the missouri and arkansas red white river basins validation was conducted at in situ measurement depths of 5 cm and 10 cm and performance was evaluated across varying soil types land cover depth slope aspect and pixel heterogeneity to determine conditions under which sport lis surface soil moisture had excellent estimation capability results demonstrate that 53 of data at a depth of 5 cm and 51 of the data at a depth of 10 cm were significantly correlated with a spearman s ρ greater than 0 5 on a daily basis based upon validation results it is evident that the sport lis surface soil moisture estimate is satisfactory for research and operational water resources management applications keywords soil moisture sport lis land surface model validation 1 introduction a thorough understanding of soil moisture across multiple spatiotemporal scales is essential for many applications including drought and flood prediction weather forecasting climatology agricultural production and water resources management an et al 2016 blankenship et al 2016 dobriyal et al 2012 fascetti et al 2016 griesfeller et al 2016 soil moisture has a significant impact on the partitioning of moisture for evapotranspiration and surface sensible and latent heat fluxes blankenship et al 2016 griesfeller et al 2016 and thus plays a major role in understanding land atmosphere interactions and climate change projections an et al 2016 griesfeller et al 2016 the european space agency identified soil moisture as one of the fifty essential climate variables in 2010 an et al 2016 griesfeller et al 2016 due to its role as a key variable in the characterization of the global climate fascetti et al 2016 with respect to water resources applications soil moisture plays an influential role within the hydrologic cycle due to its ability to control the rainfall runoff response in catchments dobriyal et al 2012 al shrafany et al 2014 alvarez garreton et al 2014

moisture is an important determinant of available water and can dictate productivity of natural and agricultural ecosystems dobriyal et al 2012 monitoring of soil moisture has proven useful for the allocation of limited water resources during drought coordinating relief efforts during floods and for preventing desertification moran et al 2004 dobriyal et al 2012 furthermore surface soil moisture is an important initial condition for hydrologic modeling meng et al 2017 li et al 2018 and flood forecasting alvarez garreton et al 2014 meng et al 2017 the assimilation of remotely sensed soil moisture has shown to improve streamflow prediction alvarez garreton et al 2014 brocca et al 2012 li et al 2018 and has demonstrated potential to advance short term flood forecasting meng et al 2017 soil moisture data across a range of scales is primarily obtained from in situ observations remotely sensed satellite observations and climate and land surface models xia et al 2015a in situ data provides a valuable point scale estimate of soil moisture that is useful for the evaluation of remotely sensed and modeled soil moisture albergel et al 2012 however dense ground based networks would be necessary to truly capture the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil moisture over large scales due to the high variability of soil properties precipitation and other physical and climatological factors that influence patterns of soil moisture dobriyal et al 2012 al shrafany et al 2014 in reality the availability of in situ soil moisture over large areas and long temporal periods is extremely limited which makes it makes it challenging to infer spatiotemporal patterns of soil moisture from in situ observations alone soil moisture derived from remote sensing platforms provides a promising avenue to examine the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture at larger scales satellite derived soil moisture observations have become a powerful tool that have enhanced our ability to understand land atmosphere processes griesfeller et al 2016 by providing global coverage at regular time intervals alvarez garreton et al 2014 a number of satellite missions have been launched for the purpose of global soil moisture observation including the advanced microwave sounding radiometer amsr e reichle et al 2007 the advanced scatterometer ascat wagner et al 1999 soil moisture ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2001 and soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 while these satellites enable the global observation of soil moisture in a way that was not previously possible with in situ measurements the ability of each satellite to accurately estimate soil moisture has proven to be variable over time and space brocca et al 2012 de jeu and dorigo 2016 the continuous increase of sensors and retrieval methods makes it difficult for the user community to understand what the exact quality of a soil moisture product is for a specific sensor and how it can be used in applications de jeu and dorigo 2016 furthermore there are serious limitations to many satellite derived soil moisture products which include the coarse spatial and temporal resolution of data and the capability to only measure the first few centimeters of soil from microwave sensors al shrafany et al 2014 alvarez garreton et al 2014 brocca et al 2012 cammalleri et al 2015 land surface models lsms provide a viable alternative to satellite derived soil moisture observations lsms enable simulation of soil moisture based upon forcing variables such as precipitation wind speed and physical properties such as soil texture and land cover koster et al 2009 blankenship et al 2016 a major advantage of model based soil moisture estimates is their ability to use real time or retrospective weather and climate information xia et al 2015a and provide estimates of soil moisture to several meters of depth at hourly daily and monthly time steps moran et al 2004 cammalleri et al 2015 the ability of different lsms to estimate soil moisture has been found comparable to in situ and remotely sensed soil moisture e g al shrafany et al 2014 srivastava et al 2015 fang et al 2016 however the reliability of model based soil moisture is heavily dependent on accurate surface forcing data and parameterization cammalleri et al 2015 yang et al 2016 koster et al 2009 xia et al 2015a regardless lsm derived soil moisture has tremendous potential to be useful in a variety of applications due to its capability to estimate soil moisture across the entire contiguous united states conus domain at high spatiotemporal resolutions this research examines the validity of lsm derived surface soil moisture for the purpose of surface water resources applications within the central united states surface soil moisture was obtained from sport lis which is an observation driven real time simulation of the unified noah lsm chen and dudhia 2001 ek et al 2003 the main objective of this research was to assess the ability of sport lis to provide reliable estimates of surface soil moisture for surface water resources operational and research applications through validation against in situ soil moisture in the missouri and arkansas red white river basins in the u s great plains region the sport lis software was selected for analysis due to its potential to provide accurate volumetric surface soil moisture estimates in real time at a higher spatial and temporal resolution than is currently provided by satellite observations or in situ measurements of the same product 2 materials methods 2 1 study area the missouri and arkansas red white river basins are located in the central united states and cover the majority of the u s great plains region fig 1 the area of the two basins combined equates to approximately 2 million square kilometers the study area encompasses ten climate regions as defined by the köppen geiger climate classification ranging from fully humid and temperate areas in the northeast to arid and dry zones in the southwest rubel and kottek 2010 there is a diverse gradient of rainfall across the study area with annual precipitation ranging from 200 mm in the west to 1000 mm in the east prism climate group 2015 3 in situ soil moisture data in situ soil moisture data was provided by the international soil moisture network ismn dorigo et al 2011 dorigo et al 2013 on a daily time scale from 2000 to 2016 the ismn is a global soil moisture database that compiles in situ data from operational partners around the world for validation of satellite observations and land surface models dorigo et al 2011 dorigo et al 2013 in situ soil moisture data is an invaluable source of information for calibration and validation of remotely sensed

and measurement errors have been thoroughly investigated e g dorigo et al 2013 gruber et al 2013 the measurement error of networks within the ismn ranges from 0 02 to 0 06 gruber et al 2013 with the average error for most networks estimated at 0 03 xia et al 2015a in situ soil moisture data was obtained for 165 stations within the missouri and arkansas red white river basins at depths of 5 cm and 10 cm fig 1 this data was maintained in ismn by five operational soil moisture networks table 1 any data that was flagged by the ismn as questionable dubious and did not receive a designation of g for good data was removed from the dataset and omitted from analysis 4 sport lis the nasa land information system lis is a high performance land surface modeling and data assimilation system that can be used to run a variety of lsms through the integration of satellite derived datasets ground based observations and model re analyses to characterize land surface states and fluxes kumar et al 2006 peters lidard et al 2007 lis can run lsms regionally or globally with a grid spacing as fine as one kilometer by using scalable high performance computing and data management technologies lis features an ensemble kalman filter algorithm evensen 2003 to conduct land surface data assimilation kumar et al 2008 kumar et al 2009 for a variety of datasets and variables such as soil moisture land surface temperature and snow e g liu et al 2013 the system also supports an optimization and uncertainty analysis for calibrating lsm parameters to observations santanello et al 2013 in addition to operating in an offline standalone mode lis has been coupled to the weather research and forecasting wrf model kumar et al 2007 for numerical weather prediction nwp research applications as part of the nasa unified wrf modeling framework peters lidard et al 2015 to enhance the land atmosphere interactions within wrf nasa s marshall space flight center s short term prediction research and transition sport center jedlovec 2013 has developed a real time application of the nasa lis for use in experimental operations by both domestic and international operational weather forecasters case 2016 case et al 2016 case and zavodsky 2018 zavodsky et al 2013 this software sport lis is an observation driven real time simulation of the unified noah lsm chen and dudhia 2001 ek et al 2003 over a full contiguous u s domain the sport lis provides soil moisture estimates at an approximately 3 km grid resolution over a 2 meter deep soil column detailed information regarding the input parameters and methodology that constitutes sport lis can be obtained from zavodsky et al 2016 and case and zavodsky 2018 the sport lis top layer volumetric soil moisture 0 10 cm estimate was selected for validation against in situ soil moisture data from ismn at depths of 5 and 10 cm sport lis soil moisture was obtained on a daily temporal scale from 2000 to 2016 for the continental united states and masked to the study area extent fig 1 5 validation the accuracy of soil moisture estimates from satellite platforms or lsms can vary by region and climate zone and thus it is important to conduct validation to determine an individual product s reliability within different areas of study wang et al 2016 there is currently no standard method of validation that dictates how remotely sensed products should be evaluated de jeu and dorigo 2016 however metrics commonly used to evaluate soil moisture derived from satellites and lsms include bias root mean square difference rmsd root mean square error rmse spearman s ranked correlation coefficient spearman s ρ and pearson s correlation coefficient albergel et al 2012 an et al 2016 fascetti et al 2016 the validation of remotely sensed data with in situ observations is not straightforward due to differences in spatial resolution observation depth and measurement uncertainty an et al 2016 xia et al 2015a the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the soil limits verification of remotely sensed soil moisture an et al 2016 blankenship et al 2016 furthermore this issue is confounded by differences in spatial resolution between measurement techniques the horizontal and vertical resolutions of in situ data and remotely sensed data are different draper et al 2009 xia et al 2015a xia et al 2015b for example in this research the sport lis soil moisture estimate has a 3 km horizontal spatial resolution at a vertical depth of 0 10 cm while the in situ soil moisture is a point scale measurement at independent depths of 5 cm and 10 cm these discrepancies in resolution between measurement techniques make the validation process complex furthermore in situ measurements may contain errors and therefore cannot be considered a true value of soil moisture albergel et al 2012 draper et al 2009 this study employed several different validation metrics and methods of assessment to assess the reliability of the sport lis volumetric surface soil moisture estimate compared to situ soil moisture data spearman s ρ rmse and bias were used to compare the sport lis surface soil moisture estimate 0 10 cm and in situ soil moisture data 5 and 10 cm depths from 2000 to 2016 spearman s ρ was used to assess the degree of similarity between sport lis soil moisture and in situ soil moisture while rmse was used to assess overall model error xia et al 2015a a measure of bias was used to assess model systematic error and evaluate possible over or under estimation of soil moisture xia et al 2015a as there is currently no standard method for evaluation of soil moisture estimates de jeu and dorigo 2016 past research was used as a guide to assign performance labels for assessing validation results previous work has established the comparison between remotely sensed or modeled soil moisture estimates against in situ data to be satisfactory when reporting correlation values of 0 42 wang et al 2016 0 53 0 70 albergel et al 2012 and 0 52 0 72 griesfeller et al 2016 in this study correlation values above 0 50 are considered to be satisfactory for research applications though values exceeding 0 75 are preferable for decision making practices moran et al 2004 validation performance was assessed on a daily basis to understand the ability of the sport lis soil moisture estimate to capture the daily variations in surface soil moisture analysis of daily soil moisture on a seasonal basis was conducted to evaluate short term variability albergel et al 2012 following albergel et al 2012 the seasons were defined as summer june july august fall september october november winter december january february and spring march april may the potential for frozen soils during the winter months will affect in situ soil moisture data xia et al 2015a especially in higher latitudes of the study area however the analysis of soil moisture over a yearlong period can provide invaluable information about annual and seasonal soil moisture trends for water resources management applications in addition there are numerous examples in the literature of annual and seasonal validation of soil moisture estimates e g albergel et al 2012 fascetti et al 2016 physical environmental characteristics such as soil texture and land cover strongly affect soil moisture xia et al 2015b thus the influence of physical environmental factors on the comparison between the sport lis soil moisture estimate and in situ data was analyzed using the kruskal wallis rank sum test only those values of spearman s ρ that were statistically significant i e p value 0 05 were utilized for this part of the analysis the physical environmental factors that were examined included land cover soil texture dominant hydrologic soil group slope and aspect land cover data was obtained from the 2011 national land cover dataset at 30 m resolution homer et al 2015 and soil data was acquired from the digital general soil map of the u s statsgo2 at a 1 250 000 resolution nrcs 2006 topographic data was obtained from the u s 3d elevation program 3dep at a 30 m resolution usgs 2016 this approach facilitated comparisons between the mean correlation value in regions of cropland for example and the mean correlation value in areas of forest cover to determine whether the validation performance varied between land cover types this statistical approach enabled identification of physical areas where the reliability of the sport lis soil moisture estimate might differ finally the tukey honest significant difference test was used to compare the validation performance between ground based measurement stations at depths of 5 cm and 10 cm to determine if the vertical resolution of measurement affected overall validation performance finally to account for discrepancies in spatial resolution between measurement techniques the shannon diversity index shdi was calculated and used to assess the influence of pixel heterogeneity across the 3 km grid on validation performance the shdi was determined using the fragstats software program which is a spatial pattern analysis program for categorical maps mcgarigal et al 2012 shdi was calculated to provide a value of heterogeneity across the 3 km grid for land cover soil texture and dominant hydrologic soil group using the 2011 national land cover dataset homer et al 2015 and statsgo2 nrcs 2006 this approach enabled evaluation of whether a high degree of heterogeneity in soil texture across a 3 km grid for example might affect the ability of sport lis to accurately estimate soil moisture when compared to ground based measurements thus this analysis enabled conclusions about the influence of discrepancies in measurement scale between remotely sensed and ground based soil moisture 6 results discussion 6 1 validation results the sport lis volumetric surface soil moisture estimate 0 10 cm was validated against in situ surface soil moisture on a daily basis at depths of 5 and 10 cm using spearman s ρ approximately 52 of points analyzed yielded a correlation value of greater than 0 5 figs 2 and 3 at depths of 5 cm and 10 cm 53 and 51 of the data returned a correlation value greater than 0 5 respectively in total and for both measurement depths the average and median correlation values were just below and above 0 5 table 2 validation metrics of bias and rmse were also calculated to assess reliability of the sport lis soil moisture estimate typical rmse values were at or below 0 1 table 2 which exceeds the typical measurement error 0 02 0 06 m3 m 3 of in situ data rmse values that surpass the corresponding in situ instrument measurement errors indicate that simulation errors are derived from model limitations such as inaccurate forcing data xia et al 2015a the average bias for both measurement depths was high though the median bias was much closer to zero with both values below ten table 2 these values of bias indicate that there may be overestimation of soil moisture by sport lis when compared to in situ data this result is consistent with previous analysis of the noah land surface model conducted by xia et al 2015a who reported that the high values of bias indicated that models and model forcings still have room to improve the combination of high bias and rmse values that exceed instrument measurement errors suggest that further refinement of the sport lis software may be necessary interestingly rmse and bias values for the 10 cm measurement depth were slightly lower than the 5 cm measurement depth which is likely due to less variability in soil moisture at the deeper 10 cm depth the sport lis soil moisture estimate was comparable on a daily basis to many of the ground based stations from 2000 to 2016 for example at the stillwater 5wnw ground measurement station fig 4 the pattern of the sport lis surface soil moisture estimates closely mirrored in situ soil moisture with a correlation value of 0 8544 however at this same location sport lis seemed to overestimate soil moisture during dry periods 0 0 3 m3 m 3 and slightly underestimate soil moisture during saturated soil conditions 0 3 m3 m 3 after examining validation data at several stations this same overestimation during dry conditions and underestimation during saturated soil conditions seemed common this could be attributed to multiple factors including misrepresentation of soil properties and or land cover characteristics at the in situ measurement station challenges associated with validating a 3 km grid cell against a point scale observation or model limitations on behalf of the sport lis software as discussed above to determine whether the sport lis soil moisture estimate demonstrated significant variability over the vertical soil profile the validation performance was further assessed by depth of the in situ measurement of the ground based measurements 101 stations had a soil moisture measurement depth of 5 cm while 132 stations reported soil moisture a depth of 10 cm in comparison the sport lis surface soil moisture estimate reflects a volumetric column depth from 0 to 10 cm the kruskal wallis test was used to statistically compare the mean spearman s ρ bias and rmse values at both depths of measurement while the results suggested that there was not a significant difference in the spearman s ρ p value 0 643 and bias p value 0 497 values a significant difference was found in the mean rmse values p value 0 009 between the two depths of measurement fig 5 this suggests that the sport lis surface soil moisture estimate had a slightly better fit with the in situ measurement at the 10 cm depth however from a practical perspective there is no substantial difference in the validation performance between the two depths of measurement as the magnitude of difference between the rmse values is small 0 012 therefore it is evident that the depth of the in situ measurement does not wield a substantial influence on the daily validation performance of sport lis 6 2 seasonal analysis the daily validation performance of the sport lis volumetric surface soil moisture estimate 0 10 cm against in situ surface soil moisture was assessed on a seasonal basis at depths of 5 and 10 cm using spearman s ρ seasonal analysis was conducted to assess how validation performance varied between the seasons throughout the year in general the seasonal validation performance at a depth of 5 cm was comparable to the overall validation performance with average spearman s ρ values above 0 4 for summer fall and winter table 3 however at the 10 cm depth only the summer and fall seasons exhibited an average spearman s ρ value above 0 4 at both depths the validation performance was highest and exhibited the least variability during the summer months which is consistent with xia et al 2015a who validated the noah lsm and demonstrated correlations that were larger in the summer months than in the winter season typical values of rmse throughout all four seasons were just above or below 0 1 which was consistent with the overall validation performance validation at depths of 10 cm consistently demonstrated lower rmse values than validation at the 5 cm depth table 3 the average bias was high for all four seasons which was also comparable to the overall validation performance though winter exhibited the highest values of average bias however values for median bias were at or below 10 for almost all of the seasons with the exception of summer 5 cm depth and winter 10 cm depth upon further examination validation performance in the winter season differed significantly between the 5 cm and 10 cm depth which is likely due to the occurrence of frozen soils at deeper depths during that period tukey s honest significant difference was used to statistically compare the validation performance between seasons at the 5 cm depth only a significant difference p value 0 0006 was found upon comparison of the mean spearman s ρ for spring against the same value for summer fig 6 though from a practical perspective the difference between the means in spring and summer is relatively small at a depth of 10 cm fig 7 however a significant difference was found between spring and fall p value 0 009 winter and fall p value 0 002 summer and spring p value 0 000 and winter and summer p value 0 000 the slightly lower validation performance in the spring and winter seasons particularly at the 10 cm depth could be attributed to the challenge of estimating soil moisture during periods of saturation in spring or frozen soils in winter this result reveals that on a seasonal basis the validation performance of sport lis soil moisture at the 10 cm depth is poor in comparison to the 5 cm depth due to the low spearman s ρ in the winter season therefore based upon both the daily and seasonal validation results the authors conclude that the sport lis soil moisture estimate is comparable with the in situ soil moisture measurements at the 5 cm depth throughout the year sport lis surface soil moisture is satisfactory for water resources applications though some caution should be applied when utilizing the soil moisture estimates within the spring months 6 3 physical environmental characteristics soil properties and land cover can substantially influence soil moisture and are important factors in water resources management xia et al 2015b thus the physical environmental characteristics at the location of each in situ measurement were assessed to evaluate the influence of environmental conditions surrounding the in situ measurement on validation performance soil texture dominant hydrologic soil group land cover aspect and slope were considered examination of the influence of soil texture on validation performance revealed no substantial influence of soil type at the in situ station on the validation performance of the sport lis soil moisture product fig 8 no significant difference among soil texture classes was found after comparing values of spearman s ρ p value 0 167 examination of the rmse values revealed a significant difference between the loam and sandy loam texture classes p value 0 029 which indicates that sport lis soil moisture had a slightly better fit with in situ measurements in loam soils compared to sandy loam soils silt loam and silty clay loam were found to be somewhat less biased than sandy loam though this comparison was not significant similar results were found at the 10 cm depth the dominant hydrologic soil group at the in situ measurement site was analyzed to assess its influence on validation performance hydrologic soil groups provide an estimate of runoff potential from low runoff potential group a to the highest runoff potential group d thus the dominant hydrologic soil group is the prevailing soil group within a specific area none of the comparisons between soil groups were found to be significantly different after comparing the spearman s ρ p value 0 103 rmse p value 0 421 or bias p value 0 0797 at either measurement depth fig 9 however some interesting patterns emerge in the results while not significant hydrologic soil group c demonstrates higher mean correlation values with lower rmse and bias when compared to group a which exhibits opposite patterns figs 9 and 10 this may indicate that sport lis is better suited in its current configuration for soil moisture estimation in poorly drained than in well drained soils however this difference could be due to the time lag between the time of a rainfall event and the time that the soil moisture measurement estimate was taken or mis characterization of soil properties at the in situ measurement site similar results were found at the 10 cm depth the land cover classification at the ground based monitoring stations was analyzed to assess its influence on validation performance of the sport lis soil moisture estimate the incorrect classification of land cover can potentially assign the wrong root zone depth or leaf area index within the model xia et al 2015b which will lead to inaccurate soil moisture estimates no significant difference p value 0 199 was found upon comparison of mean spearman s ρ values between land cover classes fig 11 however the evergreen forest land cover class exhibited significantly higher values of rmse p value 0 0112 when compared to cultivated crops and herbaceous land cover classes and displayed significant higher bias values p value 0 0115 when compared to hay pasture in general the forested land cover classes evergreen deciduous and mixed forest demonstrated poorer correlation performance higher rmse values and higher bias than other land cover classes though this difference is not significant other than the aforementioned performance of the evergreen forest class these results may be attributed to the high vegetation density of forested land cover classes which have been known to yield poor correlation results yang et al 2016 given their distribution on the taylor diagram the land cover classes of herbaceous pasture hay and cultivated crops appear to demonstrate the best overall fit fig 11 finally the influence of aspect and slope on the validation performance was evaluated through examination of the spearman s ρ rmse and bias values at each depth of measurement no significant trend was evident between either aspect nor slope and any of the validation metrics this suggests that neither aspect nor slope at this scale of resolution has any influence on validation performance 6 4 grid heterogeneity differences in measurement resolution can lead to errors in analysis especially with validation of remotely sensed data the sport lis surface soil moisture estimate is measured at a spatial resolution of 3 km while the in situ soil moisture data is a point based measurement soils and land cover can vary significantly across a 3 km grid and thus can influence the estimate from sport lis fig 12 to address whether this spatial scale mismatch wielded a substantial influence on validation performance each 3 km grid containing an in situ measurement point was examined to analyze the influence of grid heterogeneity on validation performance the program fragstats was used to calculate the shannon diversity index shdi for soil texture dominant hydrologic soil group and land cover classes a shdi value of zero represents completely homogeneous conditions and increases in value as the grid cell conditions become more heterogeneous the average and median shdi values for both soil texture and the hydrologic soil group were close to zero indicating mostly homogeneous soil conditions across the 3 km grid at all validation points table 4 land cover was much more heterogeneous with average and median shdi values approaching one results demonstrate that neither the heterogeneity of the hydrologic soil group soil texture or land cover had any significant effect on validation performance indicating that sport lis yields reasonable soil moisture estimates across the landscape 7 conclusion the objective of this study was to validate the sport lis volumetric surface soil moisture estimate 0 10 cm against in situ soil moisture observations across the missouri and arkansas red white river basins within the u s great plains and assess whether this estimate of soil moisture was suitable for water resources management applications the sport lis soil moisture estimate demonstrated satisfactory correlation with in situ data with 52 of validation points yielding a significant positive correlation and a spearman s ρ value greater than 0 5 on a daily basis analysis of validation performance on a seasonal basis revealed that soil moisture estimates in summer fall and winter were comparable to the overall validation at the 5 cm depth with spearman s ρ exceeding 0 4 for all seasons with the exception of spring however at the 10 cm depth spearman s ρ values only exceeded 0 4 during summer and fall thus it is evident that the sport lis surface soil moisture estimate is comparable with in situ soil moisture at a depth of 5 cm however caution should be applied when utilizing sport lis soil moisture estimates during the spring season due to the low correlation values the high values of bias and rmse values exceeding those of the in situ measurement error indicate that further refinement of the sport lis software may be necessary the influence of physical environmental characteristics including soil texture hydrologic soil group land cover aspect and slope were also analyzed to assess whether these factors exhibited any substantial effect on the validation while not statistically significant there was some indication that the sport lis soil moisture estimate may be most reliable for areas characterized by poorly drained soils e g hydrologic soil group c in addition forested land cover classes evergreen deciduous and mixed forest demonstrated poorer correlation performance higher rmse values and higher bias values than other land cover classes these results suggest that the sport lis soil moisture estimate might have a more difficult time capturing soil moisture fluxes in forested land which may be attributed to dense vegetation tree canopy and forest litter complicating the estimation of soil moisture in these areas however in general the majority of the environmental parameters that were examined failed to have a significant effect on the validation performance this is consistent with validation results of the noah lsm found by xia et al 2015b who demonstrated that utilization of site observed soil texture and vegetation type did not improve soil moisture simulations finally the heterogeneity of soil texture dominant hydrologic soil group and land cover across the 3 km grid at each validation point were analyzed to assess whether differences in spatial resolution of measurement points influenced validation performance in any way results show that heterogeneity of these three physical factors did not influence validation performance though these results may be attributed to the generally low measures of heterogeneity calculated for the validation locations further analysis using higher resolution land cover and soils data might be able to yield a better understanding of the effect of surface heterogeneity on the validation of remotely sensed soil moisture the results described here suggest that sport lis surface soil moisture estimates are comparable to in situ soil moisture at a measurement depth of 5 cm and that no physical environmental factors or discrepancy in measurement scale influenced the validation performance in any substantial way thus it is viable to conclude that the sport lis surface soil moisture estimate is satisfactory for research and operational water resources management applications within the missouri and arkansas red white river basins the ability to utilize soil moisture estimates with a high spatial and temporal resolution will be invaluable for analysis of spatiotemporal soil moisture patterns that will aid in the allocation of resources in drought periods prevent desertification and manage flood situations soil moisture estimates from sport lis may also be useful for assimilation in hydrologic modeling and flood forecasting applications future considerations to improve sport lis soil moisture may include the assimilation of satellite data such as from smap or smos as the assimilation of passive microwave data into lsms is known to improve soil moisture estimation yang et al 2016 data assimilation can be used to update lsms by combining model states with observations of state variables to provide an updated model analysis superior to either data source alone using satellite data blankenship et al 2016 future research may investigate the influence of anthropogenic inputs such as irrigation on in situ soil moisture as this type of phenomenon is not currently captured in the lsm simulation the validation of root zone soil moisture estimates from sport lis in future examinations of the software would also prove valuable for additional water resources applications acknowledgements this work was partially supported by the kansas nasa epscor partnership development grant nnx15ak36a r51357 6 and k state research

6928,future changes in rainfall patterns induced by climate changes will affect society and ecosystems and quantifying these changes is of utmost importance for the management of hydroclimate risk in particular the estimation of intensity duration frequency idf curves for rainfall data is a routine procedure in urban hydrology and hydraulic studies and should be revisited to reflect future changes in rainfall variability in this work we propose a novel methodology based on the scaling invariant property of rainfall duration versus intensity to estimate parameters of a generalized extreme value gev distribution at sub daily scales a bayesian inference framework is developed so that uncertainties are reduced and can be easily propagated to idf curves the proposed model can be employed to i improve local at site gev estimates for sites with limited rainfall records ii estimate gev parameters at sub daily scales and construct idf curves for sites where only daily rainfall records are available partially gauged sites iii construct regional idf curves for homogeneous hydrologic regions and iv update local and regional idf curves from simulations of future daily rainfall the model is tested using historical rainfall data from 18 gauges located in the han river watershed in south korea and projected climate change scenarios rcp 6 and rcp 8 5 from the met office hadley centre hadgem2 ao model when considering historical data the results show that the model satisfactorily estimate idf curves for both gauged and partially gauged sites in future scenarios the model reveals a substantial increase in rainfall events of rare intensity large return periods mostly due to changes in the rainfall variability rather than changes in the average rainfall particularly for a 100 year return period event we expect an increase of about 23 in scenario rcp 6 and about 30 under scenario rcp 8 5 when projected using regional idf curves to the best of our knowledge this is the first statistical approach in the literature to assess future changes in regional idf curves which in our opinion is more suitable than evaluating local estimates only keywords rainfall intensity duration frequency curves bayesian model regional estimates climate change 1 introduction statistics associated with extreme rainfalls play a major role in the design of hydraulic structures and hydrologic studies in particular the estimation of intensity duration frequency idf curves has primarily focused on analyzing historical rainfall records and estimating the intensity of an extreme rainfall event associated with a given rainfall duration and exceedance probability or return period classical methods involve the fit of a probability distribution based on local data from rainfall gauges e g chow et al 1988 singh 1992 in urban design for instance one is often interested in obtaining idf curves at sub daily time scales 1 24 h durations for projects of macro drainage systems which therefore requires rainfall records observed at least at the hourly scale the requirement of hourly rainfall records is possibly the first difficulty that arises when estimating idf curves since most rainfall surface measures around the globe still rely on traditional rainfall gauges which are designed to record daily rainfall to address this problem some studies have adopted different disaggregation schemes e g koutsoyiannis 1994 sivakumar et al 2001 gyasi agyei 2005 segond et al 2006 to simulate rainfall at shorter durations while others have explored the scale invariant assumption of rainfall intensity and duration e g nguyen et al 1998 koutsoyiannis et al 1998a menabde et al 1999 muller et al 2008 to show that local distribution estimates obtained for sites with sub daily records i e gauged sites can be used to estimate parameters at sites where only daily rainfall is observed hereafter referred as partially gauged sites as denoted in nguyen et al 1998 another complication appears due to the limited extension of rainfall records even for gauged sites where rainfall data at the desired temporal scales are still available since one is interested in extremes of rainfall the generalized extreme value gev distribution is often adopted e g nguyen et al 1998 muller et al 2008 due to its asymptotic properties in series of annual maximum data for more details see coles 2001 however estimating idf curves becomes very complicated for sites with limited or absence of rainfall records it is well known that gev estimates particularly for the shape parameter can be unreliable for limited data records e g martins and stedinger 2000 as an alternative one can employ regional estimates of parameters and determine regional idf curves that can be used for ungauged sites or even replace at site i e local idf curves nguyen et al 1998 yu et al 2004 ghanmi et al 2016 blanchet et al 2016 in constructing regional idf curves one usually needs to estimate local parameters for a given set of gauged sites and assumes that those parameters vary smoothly across the region applying then some spatial interpolation method e g kriging besides the difficulties involving limited rainfall records and unavailable data at the desired temporal scales one still tends to assume that local and regional idf curves are stationary i e the statistics of rainfall extremes are assumed to be constant over time however in a changing climate it is expected that the rising temperature will affect rainfall extremes e g berg and hall 2015 zhang and villarini 2017 and the stationarity assumption may not hold anymore studies aiming to quantify the impact of climate changes on idf curves routinely rely on future rainfall simulations obtained from general circulation models gcms or regional climate models rcms which require the use of a statistical or dynamical model to downscale the future simulation of rainfall to the temporal and spatial scales needed since often rainfall products from gcms are for large regions and at daily scale different examples of applications and methodologies to update idf curves in a changing climate are presented and discussed in some recent works lima et al 2016 li et al 2017 ragno et al 2018 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2018 we observe however that the focus has been primarily on assessing future changes in local idf curves based on downscaling areal rainfall projections from gcms which might introduce severe bias in the estimates due to the inherent difficulty of gcms to reproduce the correct spatial variability of rainfall future changes in ungauged sites or regional idf curves have attracted less attention and deserve more studies in this paper we focus primarily on providing regional idf curves based on the scaling property of rainfall as described in other studies menabde et al 1999 yu et al 2004 blanchet et al 2016 we estimate the scaling invariant parameters within a bayesian framework which allows us to derive regional estimates of the scaling coefficients and therefore regional idf curves for the present and future climate given historical rainfall data and gcm projections of daily rainfall at any specified spatial scale the proposed framework also provides better estimates of local idf parameters since it includes more information during the inference process as well as supports a better strategy to deal with parameter uncertainties finally the scaling parameters derived from the model can also be used to build idf curves for partially gauged sites where only daily rainfall is available we test the proposed model using historical rainfall data from 18 gauges located in south korea and projected climate change scenarios rcp 6 and rcp 8 5 provided by the met office hadley centre hadgem2 ao model the rest of this study is organized as follows the study area rainfall data and climate change scenario simulations are presented in section 2 the methodology describing the proposed model is introduced in section 3 in section 4 we present the results including the estimation of local and regional idf curves for the historical and future periods finally in section 5 we offer a discussion and a summary of this study 2 study area rainfall data and scenario simulations 2 1 han river watershed and rainfall data the han river watershed was selected as a case study area to explore changes in design rainfall because the river serves as a primary water supply for over 12 million people in the seoul area the han river watershed is one of the largest watersheds in south korea having an area of about 35 800 km2 and a total length of approximately 490 km long which is the fourth longest river in the korean peninsula the annual precipitation and the annual average runoff are about 1208 mm and 613 m 3 s respectively for estimation of idf curves annual maximum series of rainfall intensity at hourly scale are routinely utilized in this perspective the 44 year spanning the period 1973 2016 hourly precipitation data of 18 gauging stations for the entire han river watershed were compiled from the automatic synoptic observation system asos operated by the korean meteorological administration kma the annual maximum series corresponding to different durations are then obtained from the hourly rainfall series for subsequent frequency analysis utilizing the sliding maxima approach or s maxima as discussed in van montfort 1990 and papalexiou et al 2016 fig 1 shows the location of the han river watershed in korea along with the rainfall gauges used in this work some basic summary statistics of the hourly rainfall data including an l moment ratio diagram for different durations are provided as supplementary material 2 2 scenario simulation the national institute of meteorological research nimr under kma has adopted an atmosphere ocean coupled general circulation model hadgem2 ao for jointly participating in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 with met office hadley centre the hadgem2 ao has been utilized to explore climate responses of representative concentration pathways rcps and offer future climate change scenarios over south korea baek et al 2013 more specifically several gcm based control experiments were carried out to simulate transient changes in climate and to further investigate the effects of the greenhouse gas concentrations on both current climate for the reference period i e 1950 2005 and future climate for the future period i e 2006 2100 in the experiments the four rcp scenarios corresponding to different greenhouse gas integrations i e rcps 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 for the hadgem2 ao were explored for the 95 year future climate simulations from 2006 to 2100 the atmosphere and ocean spatial horizontal and vertical resolutions of the hadgem2 ao gcm are approximately n96 135 km l38 for the atmosphere system and 1 degree l40 for the ocean system conversely it has been well documented that there is a limitation of the gcm to represent local scale climate system due to a substantially coarser spatial resolution than half a degree regional climate models rcms are commonly employed to dynamically downscale the large scale climate patterns to those of the regional or local scale under climate change for a particular sub region forced by surface and lateral boundary conditions derived from gcms in this context a hadgem3 ra rcm which has spatial resolution of 12 5 km 0 11 degree coupled with the gcm hadgem2 ao has been adopted by kma for climate change experiments for additional details the reader can refer to other articles that address the atmospheric physics and dynamics of the model davies et al 2005 ringer et al 2006 among the four rcp scenarios we selected the most extreme rcp 6 0 and 8 5 for exploring future changes in the annual maximum daily rainfall for the han river watershed it has also been reported that climate models tend to underestimate daily rainfall amounts conversely the probability of rainfall occurrence is typically overestimated to be more specific light rain is overestimated whereas moderate and extreme rainfalls are more or less underestimated over the korean peninsula lima et al 2016 so et al 2017 for this reason this study adopted a smoothing spline based bias correction approach gudmundsson et al 2012 to correct the quantiles of simulated daily rainfall series for both the reference and the future periods for each of the 18 gauging stations analyzed in this work we extracted the daily rainfall simulated at the grid point containing the gauging station of interest for the purpose of comparison the empirical cumulative function of observed and simulated rainfall before and after bias correction is illustrated in fig 2 for one rainfall station the bias correction procedure was repeated for the remaining 17 stations 3 model for a given rainfall gauge we assume that the rainfall intensity y associated with a duration d can be written as koutsoyiannis et al 1998b 1 y d t r a t r d θ h where t r is the return period a a function of t r and 0 h 1 and θ 0 are non negative coefficients more general expressions for the denominator in 1 are discussed in grimaldi et al 2011 blanchet et al 2016 linked the idf curves at two different durations d and d 0 through the relation 2 y d t r y d 0 t r d θ d 0 θ h following the relations discussed in blanchet et al 2016 we can assume the hypothesis of scaling and then connect the qth moment at two different durations 3 e y d q d θ d 0 θ hq e y d 0 q where y denotes the random variable associated with the rainfall intensity and q is the moment order at durations d and d 0 if we further assume a gev scaling model then for any duration d it is possible to show that the rainfall intensity y d follows a gev distribution with location μ scale σ and shape ξ parameters given by nguyen et al 1998 blanchet et al 2016 4 μ d μ d 0 d θ d 0 θ h 5 σ d σ d 0 d θ d 0 θ h 6 ξ d ξ d 0 note that there is no scaling in the shape parameter and in the log log scale the relations for μ and σ become 7 log μ d log μ d 0 h log d θ d 0 θ 8 log σ d log σ d 0 h log d θ d 0 θ for urban rainfall design one is often interested in the rainfall intensity at sub daily durations whereas rainfall observations are available at daily scale hence although the choices of d and d 0 are arbitrary it is interesting to assume d 0 d 24 24 h and the scaling could be used to obtain the rainfall intensity parameters μ and σ at shorter scales e g blanchet et al 2016 moreover the appropriate use of the scaling relations assume that the sampling frequency is the same across all durations which might not be the case for daily rainfall records to address this issue one can use the hershfield factor e g papalexiou et al 2016 blanchet et al 2016 to obtain series of annual maximum rainfall of 24 h duration s maxima series from series of annual maximum daily rainfall f maxima series 3 1 the bayesian approach bayesian inference has been adopted in a wide range of hydrology studies and it is beyond the scope of this paper to explore this growing body of literature we point the reader to gaume et al 2010 haddad et al 2012 kwon et al 2008 liang et al 2011 lima and lall 2010 renard 2011 renard et al 2006 viglione et al 2013 and the references therein for a few examples of bayesian inference in hydrology including estimation of idf curves de vyver 2015 2018 lima et al 2016 mélèse et al 2018 ragno et al 2018 here in this work the main purpose to adopt a bayesian inference for the d duration rainfall modeling is to offer a framework to estimate regional parameters along with their uncertainties that can be used to build idf curves for the present and future climate we assume then for a given rainfall gauge that the annual maximum rainfall intensity y d for duration d d 1 2 24 h follows the gev distribution 9 y d gev μ d σ d ξ d which in our context has cumulative distribution function defined as 10 f x μ σ ξ exp 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ so that μ σ ξ x for ξ 0 and x μ σ ξ for ξ 0 under the bayesian framework we need to set prior distributions for the gev parameters that should reflect some knowledge we have about them if any in this case the scaling theory as displayed in eqs 6 7 and 8 provides us with the necessary insight to construct prior distributions that express our knowledge about the relations that exist between the moments of the gev distribution at different durations hence we assume as prior distributions for μ σ and ξ 11 log μ d n α h log d θ d 24 θ τ μ 2 12 log σ d n β h log d θ d 24 θ τ σ 2 13 ξ d n ξ τ ξ 2 where n denotes the normal distribution with respective mean and variance α and β are respectively the gev location log μ d 24 and scale log σ d 24 parameters associated with the rainfall duration d 24 24 h h and θ are the scaling coefficients ξ is an average shape parameter across the different durations and τ μ 2 τ σ 2 and τ ξ 2 represent the variance associated with the respective scaling processes as for hyperprior distributions we assume independent and a mixture of weakly and noninformative distributions taking into account our vague knowledge about the parameters 14 α n 0 10 6 15 β n 0 10 6 16 h b 1 1 0 1 17 θ u 0 10 18 ξ b 9 6 0 5 0 5 19 τ μ 2 inv gamma 0 01 0 01 20 τ σ 2 inv gamma 0 01 0 01 21 τ ξ 2 inv gamma 0 01 0 01 where u denotes the uniform distribution and associated lower and upper intervals b a b is the beta distribution with lower and upper bounds a and b respectively and inv gamma is the inverse gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters the priors for α and β are near flat and similar to those used in coles 2001 and de vyver 2015 2018 except that here a larger variance is employed the priors for h and θ reflect their conditions of 0 h 1 and θ 0 the prior for h is a beta distribution nearly flat between 0 and 1 as used in de vyver 2015 2018 θ has a flat non negative prior with an upper bound at 10 we noticed that the use of other near flat priors for θ with a larger or infinity upper bound such as the log normal distribution used in de vyver 2015 makes the inference procedure slow and difficult to converge the prior distribution for ξ is relatively flat between 0 3 and 0 15 and is the same as used in martins and stedinger 2000 and de vyver 2015 2018 the priors for τ μ 2 τ σ 2 and τ ξ 2 are conjugate distributions and typically used in hierarchical bayesian models gelman 2006 lunn et al 2012 3 1 1 local estimation of gev and scaling parameters given a set of n rainfall gauges the question is whether the hyperparameter vector h θ α β ξ τ μ 2 τ σ 2 τ ξ 2 should be i individually and independently estimated for each gauge non pooled estimators ii estimated considering the entire data set pooled or regional estimators or iii estimated using an intermediary approach partial pooled estimators where the hyperprior distributions of the individual parameters shrink them to some common mean see for instance the eight school problem in gelman et al 2013 in a small watershed or over a homogeneous hydrologic region it is reasonable to assume that the scaling exponents are similar for the overall rainfall process indicating that pooled estimators should be preferred however we have observed that the estimation of h θ α and β through monte carlo markov chain simulation see below is extremely slow and hard to achieve when using pooled or partial pooled estimators therefore for these four hyperparameters we adopt non pooled estimators for the remaining hyperparameters we adopt pooled i e regional estimators if we introduce the subscripts i and j to denote rainfall gauge i and year j respectively then using the bayes theorem gelman et al 2013 we can combine eqs 9 21 and write the joint posterior distribution of the complete parameter set θ as 22 pr θ y i 1 n j 1 t i d 1 24 gev y d j i μ d i σ d i ξ d i n log μ d i α i h i log d θ i d 24 θ i τ μ 2 n log σ d i β i h i log d θ i d 24 θ i τ σ 2 n ξ d i ξ τ ξ 2 n α i 0 10 6 n β i 0 10 6 b h i 1 1 0 1 u θ i 0 10 b ξ 9 6 0 5 0 5 inv gamma τ μ 2 0 01 0 01 inv gamma τ σ 2 0 01 0 01 inv gamma τ ξ 2 0 01 0 01 with y denoting the rainfall intensity data n the total number of gauges t i the total number of years for gauge i d the duration of rainfall and d 24 24 it is worth mentioning that all three gev parameters will vary across gauges i and durations d while α β h and θ will change only as a function of gauge i and the remaining parameters are pooled regional estimators analytical integration of 22 with respect to the set of parameters θ is not tractable and we adopt here the widely used markov chain monte carlo mcmc method to sample from the posterior distribution 22 the model is coded in the r platform and uses the associated packages sturtz et al 2005 wu et al 2015 and free software openbugs for the mcmc sampling scheme the standard code is freely provided as supplementary material the simulation considered 20 000 iterations for each of 5 chains the first 10 000 iterations were discard burn in period and in order to avoid serial dependence within the mcmc sample a thinning rate of 50 was used so that each chain resulted in 200 10 000 50 samples and the posterior distribution of each parameter had a sample size of 1 000 200 times 5 chains the convergence of the posterior distributions was evaluated visually based on the mixture of 5 chains and based on the r coefficient as suggested in gelman et al 2013 convergence was considered achieved when r 1 1 although most values were less than 1 01 3 1 2 estimation of gev parameters for 24 h rainfall for partially gauged sites for sites that have available only the annual maximum of daily rainfall partially gauged sites the procedure previously described cannot be directly used to estimate the gev parameters for shorter durations preventing the estimation of idf curves at the desired scale in this case we need first to estimate the equivalent annual maximum rainfall of 24 h duration which can be accomplished for instance using the hershfield correction factor e g papalexiou et al 2016 then we estimate log μ 24 α log σ 24 β and ξ 24 in a bayesian framework for a given gauge the joint posterior distribution of μ 24 σ 24 and ξ 24 is given by 23 pr μ 24 σ 24 ξ 24 y j 1 t gev y j μ 24 σ 24 ξ 24 n ξ 24 ξ τ ξ 2 with t the number of years for the selected gauge and y j the maximum 24 h rainfall for year j note that we assume uniform prior distributions for μ 24 and σ 24 for ξ 24 we use our prior knowledge and set a prior based on the regional estimates of ξ and τ ξ 2 obtained in the previous procedure eq 22 the estimation of μ 24 σ 24 and ξ 24 in 23 for partially gauged sites will follow the same procedure and diagnostic check explained in 3 1 1 their posterior distributions along with the posterior distributions of h θ ξ τ ξ 2 τ μ 2 and τ σ 2 previously obtained from eq 22 for gauged sites will then be used to estimate μ d σ d and ξ d d 1 23 as detailed in section 4 2 it is worth mentioning that for gauged sites where rainfall intensity data for all durations are available μ 24 σ 24 and ξ 24 are obtained from eq 22 4 results 4 1 posterior distributions and scaling of at site gev parameters the relation of the gev location parameter μ with the rainfall duration is shown in fig 3 for four benchmark rainfall gauges 1 daegwallyeon 2 suwon 3 yangpyeong and 4 boeun see location in fig 1 randomly selected from the full set of 18 gauges the 95 credible interval obtained from the posterior distribution is also displayed along with the ordinary gev estimates where the parameters are estimated independently for each duration for the four stations we clearly observe a nonlinear monotonic relationship of μ with rainfall duration supporting our previous assumption as stated in 11 the credible interval includes all point estimates of the ordinary gev and its spread increases as duration decreases reflecting more uncertainty in this range results for the remaining rainfall gauges are similar to those observed in fig 3 and are not shown here fig 4 displays the scaling of the gev scale parameter σ with the rainfall duration for the same benchmark gauges evaluated for μ a nonlinear relationship is also observed corroborating our previous assumption as expressed in 12 the spread of the credible intervals is also wider as the duration decreases reflecting more uncertainty for small durations however differently from the credible intervals for μ fig 3 here the intervals do not include all the point estimates from the ordinary gev the assumption of scaling and the associated prior distribution for σ eq 12 tends to produce a smoother curve of σ versus duration than the curve obtained with independent estimates where no scaling is assumed this suggests that the prior distribution i e scaling of σ has a strong power over its posterior distribution eq 22 when we consider the uncertainty in the ordinary gev estimates shown in supplementary material we noticed an overlap of credible and confidence intervals the gev shape parameter ξ does not show any kind of systematic scaling with rainfall duration as displayed in fig 5 and previously assumed in eq 13 the traditional gev estimates for ξ generally fall outside the credible intervals obtained from the bayesian model indicating a substantial degree of variability in such estimates interestingly the credible intervals are somehow similar across the four benchmark stations as well as for the other rainfall stations not shown here with positive values for most durations suggesting heavy tailed distributions fig 6 a and b show respectively the posterior distributions of h and θ for the entire set of 18 gauges the dashed lines show the posterior distributions when the individual densities are merged which can be seen as regional curves in fig 6c we do not observe any direct relation of h and α estimation of exp μ 24 but the spread i e uncertainty of the posterior distribution of α for a given station is weakly associated with the respective distribution of h conversely h and θ are strongly correlated fig 6d and it is of utmost importance to consider this relation when simulating these two parameters as input to estimate μ d σ d and ξ d for partially gauged sites see next section this finding also suggests the possibility to model θ as a function of h directly in the model which was not explored in this study as relatively large values of θ appear in the posterior distributions fig 6b we do not think that it could be omitted as is the case in other studies e g blanchet et al 2016 that employed θ 0 4 2 model application i prediction of gev parameters for partially gauged sites the ability of the proposed model to estimate the gev parameters for partially gauged sites where rainfalls of short durations are missing but observations of daily rainfall are available is tested here in a cross validation scheme as follows 1 the rainfall data set for some selected gauges testing set are withdrawn from the entire set here the selected gauges are the four benchmark stations previously presented the remaining gauges gauged sites will be used for the inference phase and will be called the calibration set 2 the posterior distributions of the scaling parameters h and θ as well as of ξ τ ξ 2 τ μ 2 and τ σ 2 are estimated only for the calibration set of gauges using eq 22 3 the simulated values of h and θ estimated at each calibration station are pooled together to obtain a regional posterior distribution for these parameters dashed lines in fig 6a and b 4 for each testing gauge considered now partially gauged sites the observed 24 h annual maximum rainfall series is used to obtain the posterior distributions of μ 24 σ 24 and ξ 24 using eq 23 the posterior distribution of ξ and τ ξ 2 obtained in step 2 is used as the prior distribution of ξ in the case that only annual maximum series of daily rainfall are available then the hershfield correction factor e g blanchet et al 2016 papalexiou et al 2016 should be used to obtain annual maximum series of 24 h duration 5 for each testing gauge the posterior distributions of μ d σ d and ξ d where d 1 23 is the rainfall duration are obtained through the scaling relations expressed in eqs 11 12 and 13 along with the posterior distributions of h θ ξ τ ξ 2 τ μ 2 and τ σ 2 obtained in step 2 for α and β we use respectively the posterior distributions of log μ 24 and log σ 24 as obtained in step 4 the scaling of the posterior distributions of μ step 5 with the rainfall duration for the selected testing gauges is shown in fig 7 the 95 credible intervals contain most of the ordinary gev estimates obtained using the entire data set as shown in fig 3 and generally follow the pattern obtained from the local bayesian model fig 3 except that they are wider to account for the larger uncertainties of out of sample estimates the scaling of the posterior estimates of σ with the rainfall duration for the selected testing gauges is displayed in fig 8 with the exception of station 1 daegwallyeon the wider credible intervals now include most of the ordinary gev estimates which was not observed for the local bayesian model fig 4 for station 1 the bayesian estimates for short durations are higher than those from the ordinary gev model reflecting more uncertainty this might be due to the location of the daegwallyeon site in eastern korea fig 1 and therefore distant from the major sites where rainfall data were used to obtain the scaling parameters h and θ finally the scaling of the posterior estimates of the shape parameter ξ fig 9 is very distinct from those ordinary gev but resemble the at site bayesian estimates fig 5 using the full data set with the median estimate being around 0 1 it is worth mentioning here that the model proposed for partially gauged sites imply that ξ has the same posterior distribution across sites and durations except for sample variations due to the mcmc simulation 4 3 model application ii historical intensity duration frequency curves for gauged and partially gauged sites in order to verify how idf curves produced by the proposed bayesian model differ from those curves obtained from ordinary gev we derive idf curves based on the median posterior estimates of μ σ and ξ simulated by the at site bayesian model and as predicted by the bayesian model for the partially gauged testing sites using the scaling invariant relation shown in figs 7 9 the results are shown in fig 10 for the selected rainfall stations 1 daegwallyeon and 2 suwon the uncertainty associated with the bayesian estimates is omitted in these figures to facilitate visualization note that the estimates for the partially gauged sites are obtained through a cross validation scheme where the rainfall data for the benchmark gauges are withdrawn from the dataset and are not used in the inference process but they are for the estimation of μ 24 and σ 24 in general both bayesian estimates are very close to the ordinary gev ones despite the differences in the distribution parameters as showed in figs 3 4 7 and 8 the largest differences appear to occur at short durations where also rainfall intensity in mm hr is higher in the case of the daegwallyeon site the overestimation of the rainfall intensity obtained in the partially gauged approach is associated with the substantial differences in the gev parameters figs 7a and 8a the results for the benchmarks gauges 3 yangpyeong and 4 boeun are similar not shown here 4 4 model application iii future climate intensity duration frequency curves for gauged sites the projection of changes in the 24 h annual maximum rainfall after the bias correction procedure as explained in section 2 2 for the daegwallyeong station for the period 2011 2100 is displayed in fig 11 for rcp scenarios 6 and 8 5 an increase in the frequency of rainfall events of magnitude around 100 200 mm and above 400 mm is projected for both scenarios while a reduction in the frequency of rainfall of magnitudes 200 300 mm is expected the main goal of this work is basically to evaluate how these projected changes in 24 h duration annual maximum rainfall will affect idf curves for local stations but also for the region under study the procedure to obtain future idf curves for gauged sites consists of 1 the at site posterior distributions of h θ and ξ d obtained using historical data section 4 1 as well as the pooled estimates for ξ τ ξ 2 τ μ 2 and τ σ 2 are saved 2 for each site the projected 24 h annual maximum rainfall series after bias correction is used to obtain the posterior distributions of μ 24 and σ 24 using the bayesian model expressed in 23 and the previous simulated values of ξ and τ ξ 2 step 1 as the prior distribution of ξ 3 for each site the predictive posterior distributions of μ d and σ d where d 1 24 is the rainfall duration is obtained for the future climate through the scaling relations expressed in eqs 11 and 12 along with the historical posterior distributions obtained in step 1 for ξ d the historical posterior distributions of the pooled estimates obtained in step 1 are used in eq 13 for α and β we use respectively the future posterior distributions of log μ 24 and log σ 24 as obtained in step 2 the idf curves produced by the at site bayesian model for the daegwallyeong and suwon stations are shown in fig 12 across scenarios an increase in the rainfall intensity is expected for scenario rcp 8 5 for the suwon station particularly for short durations while for the daegwallyeong site a reduction in the intensity is projected for scenario rcp 8 5 when compared with the historical idf curves produced by the at site bayesian model first column of fig 10 we expect a modest increase in the rainfall intensity for both sites and scenarios notably for short durations when the projected changes in future idf curves are compared with historical idfs for all sites we observe when considering an average estimate across all stations an increase in the rainfall intensity for all durations and return periods fig 13 the relative difference increases as the return period gets larger being around 18 for a 100 year return period under scenario rcp 6 it is also interesting to note that for return periods beyond 25 years the difference is larger for short durations the differences projected under scenario rcp 8 5 fig 13b are larger being around 25 for a 100 year return period event but follow similar patterns of those changes projected under scenario rcp 6 fig 13a 4 5 model application iv regional intensity duration frequency curves for historical and future climates in order to minimize noise that can be attributed to downscaled gcm rcm projections for specific sites we propose a regional idf curve using the following procedure 1 the historical rainfall for all gauged sites is used to estimate the at site posterior distributions of h and θ and the pooled estimates for ξ τ ξ 2 τ μ 2 and τ σ 2 as described before 2 using the bayesian model expressed in 23 and the estimates of ξ and τ ξ 2 obtained in step 1 we estimate regional gev location μ 24 scale σ 24 and shape ξ 24 parameters for a duration of 24 h after concatenating the observed annual maximum 24 h rainfall for all sites into a single vector 3 the regional estimates of μ d σ d and ξ d d 1 23 are estimated through the scaling relations expressed in eqs 11 12 and 13 together with the historical posterior distributions of h θ ξ τ ξ 2 τ μ 2 and τ σ 2 obtained in step 1 for α and β we use respectively the posterior distributions of log μ 24 and log σ 24 as obtained in step 2 4 the regional historical idf curve is obtained using the posterior estimates of μ d σ d and ξ d d 1 24 5 for future idf curves we first apply the bias correction procedure as previously described to obtain the future projections scenarios rcp 6 and rcp 8 5 of the annual maximum 24 h rainfall for each site we then use these projections to estimate the future regional gev parameters μ 24 σ 24 and ξ 24 as in step 2 the procedures described in steps 3 and 4 are now performed using these estimates to obtain regional future idf curves for each rcp scenario fig 14 displays the posterior distributions of μ 24 and σ 24 for the historical period and future scenarios rcp 6 and rcp 8 5 a slight shift in the location parameter μ 24 is observed for both scenarios but with no apparent differences between their projections conversely a significant increase in the scale parameter σ 24 is projected for both scenarios in the order of 30 for rcp 6 and 40 for rcp 8 5 in this sense the regionally projected changes in rainfall intensity are more associated with changes in variability rather than changes in the mean value the historical and future idf curves obtained for the regional bayesian model are shown in fig 15 for all durations and return periods we expect an increase in the extreme rainfalls in terms of relative differences fig 16 the values range from an increase of 7 for a 2 year return period in rcp 6 up to an increase of about 30 for a 100 year return period under scenario rcp 8 5 such increases now appear larger than those projected when averaging across all stations fig 13 and apparently are more constant along the rainfall duration for a fixed return period 5 discussion and summary a gev local regional bayesian model was proposed to estimate idf curves based on the scaling invariant property of the rainfall process in this context we estimate sub daily at site gev parameters for extreme rainfalls as well as for partially and ungauged sites when using estimates obtained for the 24 h rainfall and the scaling parameters h and θ the model was applied to rainfall series from 18 stations located in the han river watershed in south korea to estimate local and regional idf curves based on the historical record and the future scenarios rcp 6 and rcp 8 5 of daily maximum rainfall generated by the hadgem2 ao model the scaling property of the gev location and scale parameters with the rainfall duration were confirmed for all sites considering both ordinary gev and bayesian estimates from the proposed model the shape parameter has no observed scaling in agreement with the literature blanchet et al 2016 the uncertainty associated with the scaling estimates lead to appreciable differences between ordinary and bayesian estimates particularly for short durations the scaling parameters h and θ are well correlated but we did not observe any significant relation with the location parameter for the 24 h maximum rainfall α suggesting that we can merge the at site posterior distributions of h and θ into a single regional distribution that can be used to estimate local or regional gev parameters for short rainfall durations when only series of annual maximum 24 h rainfall are available following this procedure we obtained gev estimates for cross validated partially gauged sites that satisfactorily agree with the ordinary gev as well as with those from the proposed local bayesian model when compared with ordinary gev the bayesian model proposed here makes use of more information to estimate the parameters as it considers the scaling invariant property of rainfall in its formulation leading to a reduction in the associated uncertainty which can also be easily incorporated in the idf curves if desired idf curves derived from the local bayesian model generally follow the curves obtained from the ordinary gev model however idf curves obtained for partially gauged sites can overestimate the intensity for short durations and large return periods and this should be observed when using these curves particularly for regions where the spatial variability of rainfall is high or the target site is distant from the major ones whose rainfall data were used to estimate the scaling parameters alternatively in such circumstances we suggest to obtain regional idf curves using the model proposed in this work and utilize them for partially gauged and ungauged sites one could also explore the use of at site estimates of the scaling parameters h and θ to obtain the gev parameters of short rainfall durations for nearby partially gauged sites when considering future scenarios of rainfall for individual sites we projected an increase in the rainfall intensity particularly for rare events high return periods and under scenario rcp 8 5 however local projections might be unreliable due to the high uncertainty in the spatial variability projected by gcms in order to address this issue we proposed a bayesian model in which regional gev parameters are estimated for the 24 h maximum rainfall and the estimates of the scaling parameters are used to estimate regional parameters for shorter durations using this approach we observed that most future changes in rainfall intensity are driven by changes in the scale parameter i e we expect more variability in the extremes modest changes in the location are also expected but there is no difference between their projections from scenarios rcp 6 and rcp 8 5 the projected changes in rainfall intensity are now higher than those obtained when averaging future estimates across stations the most pronounced changes up to about 30 for scenario rcp 8 5 are again expected for rare events large return periods but interestingly for a fixed return period the magnitude of changes tends to be constant across durations contrary to what was obtained for local sites to the best of our knowledge this is the first statistical approach in the literature to estimate future changes in regional idf curves which we believe is a more pertinent approach given the high uncertainty in the way gcms simulated the spatial variability of rainfall credible intervals for the expected changes can also be easily incorporated in the regional idf curves if requested we assumed that the scaling pattern of the rainfall process and the posterior distribution of the shape parameter will remain in the future climate as estimated in the historical period this stationary assumption is crucial for the bayesian model proposed in this work and it can be hard to evaluate given the limitations of gcms to simulate sub daily rainfall the results should also be appraised in the context of the hadgem2 ao model simulations it is not clear whether such changes will be observed for different gcm simulations the physical reasons for the expected changes in future idf curves for the selected rainfall stations were not explored in this study and will be the theme of future work a regional model considering larger and more heterogeneous regions will also be explored in future works 5 1 acknowledgments this work was mainly supported by the

6928,future changes in rainfall patterns induced by climate changes will affect society and ecosystems and quantifying these changes is of utmost importance for the management of hydroclimate risk in particular the estimation of intensity duration frequency idf curves for rainfall data is a routine procedure in urban hydrology and hydraulic studies and should be revisited to reflect future changes in rainfall variability in this work we propose a novel methodology based on the scaling invariant property of rainfall duration versus intensity to estimate parameters of a generalized extreme value gev distribution at sub daily scales a bayesian inference framework is developed so that uncertainties are reduced and can be easily propagated to idf curves the proposed model can be employed to i improve local at site gev estimates for sites with limited rainfall records ii estimate gev parameters at sub daily scales and construct idf curves for sites where only daily rainfall records are available partially gauged sites iii construct regional idf curves for homogeneous hydrologic regions and iv update local and regional idf curves from simulations of future daily rainfall the model is tested using historical rainfall data from 18 gauges located in the han river watershed in south korea and projected climate change scenarios rcp 6 and rcp 8 5 from the met office hadley centre hadgem2 ao model when considering historical data the results show that the model satisfactorily estimate idf curves for both gauged and partially gauged sites in future scenarios the model reveals a substantial increase in rainfall events of rare intensity large return periods mostly due to changes in the rainfall variability rather than changes in the average rainfall particularly for a 100 year return period event we expect an increase of about 23 in scenario rcp 6 and about 30 under scenario rcp 8 5 when projected using regional idf curves to the best of our knowledge this is the first statistical approach in the literature to assess future changes in regional idf curves which in our opinion is more suitable than evaluating local estimates only keywords rainfall intensity duration frequency curves bayesian model regional estimates climate change 1 introduction statistics associated with extreme rainfalls play a major role in the design of hydraulic structures and hydrologic studies in particular the estimation of intensity duration frequency idf curves has primarily focused on analyzing historical rainfall records and estimating the intensity of an extreme rainfall event associated with a given rainfall duration and exceedance probability or return period classical methods involve the fit of a probability distribution based on local data from rainfall gauges e g chow et al 1988 singh 1992 in urban design for instance one is often interested in obtaining idf curves at sub daily time scales 1 24 h durations for projects of macro drainage systems which therefore requires rainfall records observed at least at the hourly scale the requirement of hourly rainfall records is possibly the first difficulty that arises when estimating idf curves since most rainfall surface measures around the globe still rely on traditional rainfall gauges which are designed to record daily rainfall to address this problem some studies have adopted different disaggregation schemes e g koutsoyiannis 1994 sivakumar et al 2001 gyasi agyei 2005 segond et al 2006 to simulate rainfall at shorter durations while others have explored the scale invariant assumption of rainfall intensity and duration e g nguyen et al 1998 koutsoyiannis et al 1998a menabde et al 1999 muller et al 2008 to show that local distribution estimates obtained for sites with sub daily records i e gauged sites can be used to estimate parameters at sites where only daily rainfall is observed hereafter referred as partially gauged sites as denoted in nguyen et al 1998 another complication appears due to the limited extension of rainfall records even for gauged sites where rainfall data at the desired temporal scales are still available since one is interested in extremes of rainfall the generalized extreme value gev distribution is often adopted e g nguyen et al 1998 muller et al 2008 due to its asymptotic properties in series of annual maximum data for more details see coles 2001 however estimating idf curves becomes very complicated for sites with limited or absence of rainfall records it is well known that gev estimates particularly for the shape parameter can be unreliable for limited data records e g martins and stedinger 2000 as an alternative one can employ regional estimates of parameters and determine regional idf curves that can be used for ungauged sites or even replace at site i e local idf curves nguyen et al 1998 yu et al 2004 ghanmi et al 2016 blanchet et al 2016 in constructing regional idf curves one usually needs to estimate local parameters for a given set of gauged sites and assumes that those parameters vary smoothly across the region applying then some spatial interpolation method e g kriging besides the difficulties involving limited rainfall records and unavailable data at the desired temporal scales one still tends to assume that local and regional idf curves are stationary i e the statistics of rainfall extremes are assumed to be constant over time however in a changing climate it is expected that the rising temperature will affect rainfall extremes e g berg and hall 2015 zhang and villarini 2017 and the stationarity assumption may not hold anymore studies aiming to quantify the impact of climate changes on idf curves routinely rely on future rainfall simulations obtained from general circulation models gcms or regional climate models rcms which require the use of a statistical or dynamical model to downscale the future simulation of rainfall to the temporal and spatial scales needed since often rainfall products from gcms are for large regions and at daily scale different examples of applications and methodologies to update idf curves in a changing climate are presented and discussed in some recent works lima et al 2016 li et al 2017 ragno et al 2018 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2018 we observe however that the focus has been primarily on assessing future changes in local idf curves based on downscaling areal rainfall projections from gcms which might introduce severe bias in the estimates due to the inherent difficulty of gcms to reproduce the correct spatial variability of rainfall future changes in ungauged sites or regional idf curves have attracted less attention and deserve more studies in this paper we focus primarily on providing regional idf curves based on the scaling property of rainfall as described in other studies menabde et al 1999 yu et al 2004 blanchet et al 2016 we estimate the scaling invariant parameters within a bayesian framework which allows us to derive regional estimates of the scaling coefficients and therefore regional idf curves for the present and future climate given historical rainfall data and gcm projections of daily rainfall at any specified spatial scale the proposed framework also provides better estimates of local idf parameters since it includes more information during the inference process as well as supports a better strategy to deal with parameter uncertainties finally the scaling parameters derived from the model can also be used to build idf curves for partially gauged sites where only daily rainfall is available we test the proposed model using historical rainfall data from 18 gauges located in south korea and projected climate change scenarios rcp 6 and rcp 8 5 provided by the met office hadley centre hadgem2 ao model the rest of this study is organized as follows the study area rainfall data and climate change scenario simulations are presented in section 2 the methodology describing the proposed model is introduced in section 3 in section 4 we present the results including the estimation of local and regional idf curves for the historical and future periods finally in section 5 we offer a discussion and a summary of this study 2 study area rainfall data and scenario simulations 2 1 han river watershed and rainfall data the han river watershed was selected as a case study area to explore changes in design rainfall because the river serves as a primary water supply for over 12 million people in the seoul area the han river watershed is one of the largest watersheds in south korea having an area of about 35 800 km2 and a total length of approximately 490 km long which is the fourth longest river in the korean peninsula the annual precipitation and the annual average runoff are about 1208 mm and 613 m 3 s respectively for estimation of idf curves annual maximum series of rainfall intensity at hourly scale are routinely utilized in this perspective the 44 year spanning the period 1973 2016 hourly precipitation data of 18 gauging stations for the entire han river watershed were compiled from the automatic synoptic observation system asos operated by the korean meteorological administration kma the annual maximum series corresponding to different durations are then obtained from the hourly rainfall series for subsequent frequency analysis utilizing the sliding maxima approach or s maxima as discussed in van montfort 1990 and papalexiou et al 2016 fig 1 shows the location of the han river watershed in korea along with the rainfall gauges used in this work some basic summary statistics of the hourly rainfall data including an l moment ratio diagram for different durations are provided as supplementary material 2 2 scenario simulation the national institute of meteorological research nimr under kma has adopted an atmosphere ocean coupled general circulation model hadgem2 ao for jointly participating in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 with met office hadley centre the hadgem2 ao has been utilized to explore climate responses of representative concentration pathways rcps and offer future climate change scenarios over south korea baek et al 2013 more specifically several gcm based control experiments were carried out to simulate transient changes in climate and to further investigate the effects of the greenhouse gas concentrations on both current climate for the reference period i e 1950 2005 and future climate for the future period i e 2006 2100 in the experiments the four rcp scenarios corresponding to different greenhouse gas integrations i e rcps 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 for the hadgem2 ao were explored for the 95 year future climate simulations from 2006 to 2100 the atmosphere and ocean spatial horizontal and vertical resolutions of the hadgem2 ao gcm are approximately n96 135 km l38 for the atmosphere system and 1 degree l40 for the ocean system conversely it has been well documented that there is a limitation of the gcm to represent local scale climate system due to a substantially coarser spatial resolution than half a degree regional climate models rcms are commonly employed to dynamically downscale the large scale climate patterns to those of the regional or local scale under climate change for a particular sub region forced by surface and lateral boundary conditions derived from gcms in this context a hadgem3 ra rcm which has spatial resolution of 12 5 km 0 11 degree coupled with the gcm hadgem2 ao has been adopted by kma for climate change experiments for additional details the reader can refer to other articles that address the atmospheric physics and dynamics of the model davies et al 2005 ringer et al 2006 among the four rcp scenarios we selected the most extreme rcp 6 0 and 8 5 for exploring future changes in the annual maximum daily rainfall for the han river watershed it has also been reported that climate models tend to underestimate daily rainfall amounts conversely the probability of rainfall occurrence is typically overestimated to be more specific light rain is overestimated whereas moderate and extreme rainfalls are more or less underestimated over the korean peninsula lima et al 2016 so et al 2017 for this reason this study adopted a smoothing spline based bias correction approach gudmundsson et al 2012 to correct the quantiles of simulated daily rainfall series for both the reference and the future periods for each of the 18 gauging stations analyzed in this work we extracted the daily rainfall simulated at the grid point containing the gauging station of interest for the purpose of comparison the empirical cumulative function of observed and simulated rainfall before and after bias correction is illustrated in fig 2 for one rainfall station the bias correction procedure was repeated for the remaining 17 stations 3 model for a given rainfall gauge we assume that the rainfall intensity y associated with a duration d can be written as koutsoyiannis et al 1998b 1 y d t r a t r d θ h where t r is the return period a a function of t r and 0 h 1 and θ 0 are non negative coefficients more general expressions for the denominator in 1 are discussed in grimaldi et al 2011 blanchet et al 2016 linked the idf curves at two different durations d and d 0 through the relation 2 y d t r y d 0 t r d θ d 0 θ h following the relations discussed in blanchet et al 2016 we can assume the hypothesis of scaling and then connect the qth moment at two different durations 3 e y d q d θ d 0 θ hq e y d 0 q where y denotes the random variable associated with the rainfall intensity and q is the moment order at durations d and d 0 if we further assume a gev scaling model then for any duration d it is possible to show that the rainfall intensity y d follows a gev distribution with location μ scale σ and shape ξ parameters given by nguyen et al 1998 blanchet et al 2016 4 μ d μ d 0 d θ d 0 θ h 5 σ d σ d 0 d θ d 0 θ h 6 ξ d ξ d 0 note that there is no scaling in the shape parameter and in the log log scale the relations for μ and σ become 7 log μ d log μ d 0 h log d θ d 0 θ 8 log σ d log σ d 0 h log d θ d 0 θ for urban rainfall design one is often interested in the rainfall intensity at sub daily durations whereas rainfall observations are available at daily scale hence although the choices of d and d 0 are arbitrary it is interesting to assume d 0 d 24 24 h and the scaling could be used to obtain the rainfall intensity parameters μ and σ at shorter scales e g blanchet et al 2016 moreover the appropriate use of the scaling relations assume that the sampling frequency is the same across all durations which might not be the case for daily rainfall records to address this issue one can use the hershfield factor e g papalexiou et al 2016 blanchet et al 2016 to obtain series of annual maximum rainfall of 24 h duration s maxima series from series of annual maximum daily rainfall f maxima series 3 1 the bayesian approach bayesian inference has been adopted in a wide range of hydrology studies and it is beyond the scope of this paper to explore this growing body of literature we point the reader to gaume et al 2010 haddad et al 2012 kwon et al 2008 liang et al 2011 lima and lall 2010 renard 2011 renard et al 2006 viglione et al 2013 and the references therein for a few examples of bayesian inference in hydrology including estimation of idf curves de vyver 2015 2018 lima et al 2016 mélèse et al 2018 ragno et al 2018 here in this work the main purpose to adopt a bayesian inference for the d duration rainfall modeling is to offer a framework to estimate regional parameters along with their uncertainties that can be used to build idf curves for the present and future climate we assume then for a given rainfall gauge that the annual maximum rainfall intensity y d for duration d d 1 2 24 h follows the gev distribution 9 y d gev μ d σ d ξ d which in our context has cumulative distribution function defined as 10 f x μ σ ξ exp 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ so that μ σ ξ x for ξ 0 and x μ σ ξ for ξ 0 under the bayesian framework we need to set prior distributions for the gev parameters that should reflect some knowledge we have about them if any in this case the scaling theory as displayed in eqs 6 7 and 8 provides us with the necessary insight to construct prior distributions that express our knowledge about the relations that exist between the moments of the gev distribution at different durations hence we assume as prior distributions for μ σ and ξ 11 log μ d n α h log d θ d 24 θ τ μ 2 12 log σ d n β h log d θ d 24 θ τ σ 2 13 ξ d n ξ τ ξ 2 where n denotes the normal distribution with respective mean and variance α and β are respectively the gev location log μ d 24 and scale log σ d 24 parameters associated with the rainfall duration d 24 24 h h and θ are the scaling coefficients ξ is an average shape parameter across the different durations and τ μ 2 τ σ 2 and τ ξ 2 represent the variance associated with the respective scaling processes as for hyperprior distributions we assume independent and a mixture of weakly and noninformative distributions taking into account our vague knowledge about the parameters 14 α n 0 10 6 15 β n 0 10 6 16 h b 1 1 0 1 17 θ u 0 10 18 ξ b 9 6 0 5 0 5 19 τ μ 2 inv gamma 0 01 0 01 20 τ σ 2 inv gamma 0 01 0 01 21 τ ξ 2 inv gamma 0 01 0 01 where u denotes the uniform distribution and associated lower and upper intervals b a b is the beta distribution with lower and upper bounds a and b respectively and inv gamma is the inverse gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters the priors for α and β are near flat and similar to those used in coles 2001 and de vyver 2015 2018 except that here a larger variance is employed the priors for h and θ reflect their conditions of 0 h 1 and θ 0 the prior for h is a beta distribution nearly flat between 0 and 1 as used in de vyver 2015 2018 θ has a flat non negative prior with an upper bound at 10 we noticed that the use of other near flat priors for θ with a larger or infinity upper bound such as the log normal distribution used in de vyver 2015 makes the inference procedure slow and difficult to converge the prior distribution for ξ is relatively flat between 0 3 and 0 15 and is the same as used in martins and stedinger 2000 and de vyver 2015 2018 the priors for τ μ 2 τ σ 2 and τ ξ 2 are conjugate distributions and typically used in hierarchical bayesian models gelman 2006 lunn et al 2012 3 1 1 local estimation of gev and scaling parameters given a set of n rainfall gauges the question is whether the hyperparameter vector h θ α β ξ τ μ 2 τ σ 2 τ ξ 2 should be i individually and independently estimated for each gauge non pooled estimators ii estimated considering the entire data set pooled or regional estimators or iii estimated using an intermediary approach partial pooled estimators where the hyperprior distributions of the individual parameters shrink them to some common mean see for instance the eight school problem in gelman et al 2013 in a small watershed or over a homogeneous hydrologic region it is reasonable to assume that the scaling exponents are similar for the overall rainfall process indicating that pooled estimators should be preferred however we have observed that the estimation of h θ α and β through monte carlo markov chain simulation see below is extremely slow and hard to achieve when using pooled or partial pooled estimators therefore for these four hyperparameters we adopt non pooled estimators for the remaining hyperparameters we adopt pooled i e regional estimators if we introduce the subscripts i and j to denote rainfall gauge i and year j respectively then using the bayes theorem gelman et al 2013 we can combine eqs 9 21 and write the joint posterior distribution of the complete parameter set θ as 22 pr θ y i 1 n j 1 t i d 1 24 gev y d j i μ d i σ d i ξ d i n log μ d i α i h i log d θ i d 24 θ i τ μ 2 n log σ d i β i h i log d θ i d 24 θ i τ σ 2 n ξ d i ξ τ ξ 2 n α i 0 10 6 n β i 0 10 6 b h i 1 1 0 1 u θ i 0 10 b ξ 9 6 0 5 0 5 inv gamma τ μ 2 0 01 0 01 inv gamma τ σ 2 0 01 0 01 inv gamma τ ξ 2 0 01 0 01 with y denoting the rainfall intensity data n the total number of gauges t i the total number of years for gauge i d the duration of rainfall and d 24 24 it is worth mentioning that all three gev parameters will vary across gauges i and durations d while α β h and θ will change only as a function of gauge i and the remaining parameters are pooled regional estimators analytical integration of 22 with respect to the set of parameters θ is not tractable and we adopt here the widely used markov chain monte carlo mcmc method to sample from the posterior distribution 22 the model is coded in the r platform and uses the associated packages sturtz et al 2005 wu et al 2015 and free software openbugs for the mcmc sampling scheme the standard code is freely provided as supplementary material the simulation considered 20 000 iterations for each of 5 chains the first 10 000 iterations were discard burn in period and in order to avoid serial dependence within the mcmc sample a thinning rate of 50 was used so that each chain resulted in 200 10 000 50 samples and the posterior distribution of each parameter had a sample size of 1 000 200 times 5 chains the convergence of the posterior distributions was evaluated visually based on the mixture of 5 chains and based on the r coefficient as suggested in gelman et al 2013 convergence was considered achieved when r 1 1 although most values were less than 1 01 3 1 2 estimation of gev parameters for 24 h rainfall for partially gauged sites for sites that have available only the annual maximum of daily rainfall partially gauged sites the procedure previously described cannot be directly used to estimate the gev parameters for shorter durations preventing the estimation of idf curves at the desired scale in this case we need first to estimate the equivalent annual maximum rainfall of 24 h duration which can be accomplished for instance using the hershfield correction factor e g papalexiou et al 2016 then we estimate log μ 24 α log σ 24 β and ξ 24 in a bayesian framework for a given gauge the joint posterior distribution of μ 24 σ 24 and ξ 24 is given by 23 pr μ 24 σ 24 ξ 24 y j 1 t gev y j μ 24 σ 24 ξ 24 n ξ 24 ξ τ ξ 2 with t the number of years for the selected gauge and y j the maximum 24 h rainfall for year j note that we assume uniform prior distributions for μ 24 and σ 24 for ξ 24 we use our prior knowledge and set a prior based on the regional estimates of ξ and τ ξ 2 obtained in the previous procedure eq 22 the estimation of μ 24 σ 24 and ξ 24 in 23 for partially gauged sites will follow the same procedure and diagnostic check explained in 3 1 1 their posterior distributions along with the posterior distributions of h θ ξ τ ξ 2 τ μ 2 and τ σ 2 previously obtained from eq 22 for gauged sites will then be used to estimate μ d σ d and ξ d d 1 23 as detailed in section 4 2 it is worth mentioning that for gauged sites where rainfall intensity data for all durations are available μ 24 σ 24 and ξ 24 are obtained from eq 22 4 results 4 1 posterior distributions and scaling of at site gev parameters the relation of the gev location parameter μ with the rainfall duration is shown in fig 3 for four benchmark rainfall gauges 1 daegwallyeon 2 suwon 3 yangpyeong and 4 boeun see location in fig 1 randomly selected from the full set of 18 gauges the 95 credible interval obtained from the posterior distribution is also displayed along with the ordinary gev estimates where the parameters are estimated independently for each duration for the four stations we clearly observe a nonlinear monotonic relationship of μ with rainfall duration supporting our previous assumption as stated in 11 the credible interval includes all point estimates of the ordinary gev and its spread increases as duration decreases reflecting more uncertainty in this range results for the remaining rainfall gauges are similar to those observed in fig 3 and are not shown here fig 4 displays the scaling of the gev scale parameter σ with the rainfall duration for the same benchmark gauges evaluated for μ a nonlinear relationship is also observed corroborating our previous assumption as expressed in 12 the spread of the credible intervals is also wider as the duration decreases reflecting more uncertainty for small durations however differently from the credible intervals for μ fig 3 here the intervals do not include all the point estimates from the ordinary gev the assumption of scaling and the associated prior distribution for σ eq 12 tends to produce a smoother curve of σ versus duration than the curve obtained with independent estimates where no scaling is assumed this suggests that the prior distribution i e scaling of σ has a strong power over its posterior distribution eq 22 when we consider the uncertainty in the ordinary gev estimates shown in supplementary material we noticed an overlap of credible and confidence intervals the gev shape parameter ξ does not show any kind of systematic scaling with rainfall duration as displayed in fig 5 and previously assumed in eq 13 the traditional gev estimates for ξ generally fall outside the credible intervals obtained from the bayesian model indicating a substantial degree of variability in such estimates interestingly the credible intervals are somehow similar across the four benchmark stations as well as for the other rainfall stations not shown here with positive values for most durations suggesting heavy tailed distributions fig 6 a and b show respectively the posterior distributions of h and θ for the entire set of 18 gauges the dashed lines show the posterior distributions when the individual densities are merged which can be seen as regional curves in fig 6c we do not observe any direct relation of h and α estimation of exp μ 24 but the spread i e uncertainty of the posterior distribution of α for a given station is weakly associated with the respective distribution of h conversely h and θ are strongly correlated fig 6d and it is of utmost importance to consider this relation when simulating these two parameters as input to estimate μ d σ d and ξ d for partially gauged sites see next section this finding also suggests the possibility to model θ as a function of h directly in the model which was not explored in this study as relatively large values of θ appear in the posterior distributions fig 6b we do not think that it could be omitted as is the case in other studies e g blanchet et al 2016 that employed θ 0 4 2 model application i prediction of gev parameters for partially gauged sites the ability of the proposed model to estimate the gev parameters for partially gauged sites where rainfalls of short durations are missing but observations of daily rainfall are available is tested here in a cross validation scheme as follows 1 the rainfall data set for some selected gauges testing set are withdrawn from the entire set here the selected gauges are the four benchmark stations previously presented the remaining gauges gauged sites will be used for the inference phase and will be called the calibration set 2 the posterior distributions of the scaling parameters h and θ as well as of ξ τ ξ 2 τ μ 2 and τ σ 2 are estimated only for the calibration set of gauges using eq 22 3 the simulated values of h and θ estimated at each calibration station are pooled together to obtain a regional posterior distribution for these parameters dashed lines in fig 6a and b 4 for each testing gauge considered now partially gauged sites the observed 24 h annual maximum rainfall series is used to obtain the posterior distributions of μ 24 σ 24 and ξ 24 using eq 23 the posterior distribution of ξ and τ ξ 2 obtained in step 2 is used as the prior distribution of ξ in the case that only annual maximum series of daily rainfall are available then the hershfield correction factor e g blanchet et al 2016 papalexiou et al 2016 should be used to obtain annual maximum series of 24 h duration 5 for each testing gauge the posterior distributions of μ d σ d and ξ d where d 1 23 is the rainfall duration are obtained through the scaling relations expressed in eqs 11 12 and 13 along with the posterior distributions of h θ ξ τ ξ 2 τ μ 2 and τ σ 2 obtained in step 2 for α and β we use respectively the posterior distributions of log μ 24 and log σ 24 as obtained in step 4 the scaling of the posterior distributions of μ step 5 with the rainfall duration for the selected testing gauges is shown in fig 7 the 95 credible intervals contain most of the ordinary gev estimates obtained using the entire data set as shown in fig 3 and generally follow the pattern obtained from the local bayesian model fig 3 except that they are wider to account for the larger uncertainties of out of sample estimates the scaling of the posterior estimates of σ with the rainfall duration for the selected testing gauges is displayed in fig 8 with the exception of station 1 daegwallyeon the wider credible intervals now include most of the ordinary gev estimates which was not observed for the local bayesian model fig 4 for station 1 the bayesian estimates for short durations are higher than those from the ordinary gev model reflecting more uncertainty this might be due to the location of the daegwallyeon site in eastern korea fig 1 and therefore distant from the major sites where rainfall data were used to obtain the scaling parameters h and θ finally the scaling of the posterior estimates of the shape parameter ξ fig 9 is very distinct from those ordinary gev but resemble the at site bayesian estimates fig 5 using the full data set with the median estimate being around 0 1 it is worth mentioning here that the model proposed for partially gauged sites imply that ξ has the same posterior distribution across sites and durations except for sample variations due to the mcmc simulation 4 3 model application ii historical intensity duration frequency curves for gauged and partially gauged sites in order to verify how idf curves produced by the proposed bayesian model differ from those curves obtained from ordinary gev we derive idf curves based on the median posterior estimates of μ σ and ξ simulated by the at site bayesian model and as predicted by the bayesian model for the partially gauged testing sites using the scaling invariant relation shown in figs 7 9 the results are shown in fig 10 for the selected rainfall stations 1 daegwallyeon and 2 suwon the uncertainty associated with the bayesian estimates is omitted in these figures to facilitate visualization note that the estimates for the partially gauged sites are obtained through a cross validation scheme where the rainfall data for the benchmark gauges are withdrawn from the dataset and are not used in the inference process but they are for the estimation of μ 24 and σ 24 in general both bayesian estimates are very close to the ordinary gev ones despite the differences in the distribution parameters as showed in figs 3 4 7 and 8 the largest differences appear to occur at short durations where also rainfall intensity in mm hr is higher in the case of the daegwallyeon site the overestimation of the rainfall intensity obtained in the partially gauged approach is associated with the substantial differences in the gev parameters figs 7a and 8a the results for the benchmarks gauges 3 yangpyeong and 4 boeun are similar not shown here 4 4 model application iii future climate intensity duration frequency curves for gauged sites the projection of changes in the 24 h annual maximum rainfall after the bias correction procedure as explained in section 2 2 for the daegwallyeong station for the period 2011 2100 is displayed in fig 11 for rcp scenarios 6 and 8 5 an increase in the frequency of rainfall events of magnitude around 100 200 mm and above 400 mm is projected for both scenarios while a reduction in the frequency of rainfall of magnitudes 200 300 mm is expected the main goal of this work is basically to evaluate how these projected changes in 24 h duration annual maximum rainfall will affect idf curves for local stations but also for the region under study the procedure to obtain future idf curves for gauged sites consists of 1 the at site posterior distributions of h θ and ξ d obtained using historical data section 4 1 as well as the pooled estimates for ξ τ ξ 2 τ μ 2 and τ σ 2 are saved 2 for each site the projected 24 h annual maximum rainfall series after bias correction is used to obtain the posterior distributions of μ 24 and σ 24 using the bayesian model expressed in 23 and the previous simulated values of ξ and τ ξ 2 step 1 as the prior distribution of ξ 3 for each site the predictive posterior distributions of μ d and σ d where d 1 24 is the rainfall duration is obtained for the future climate through the scaling relations expressed in eqs 11 and 12 along with the historical posterior distributions obtained in step 1 for ξ d the historical posterior distributions of the pooled estimates obtained in step 1 are used in eq 13 for α and β we use respectively the future posterior distributions of log μ 24 and log σ 24 as obtained in step 2 the idf curves produced by the at site bayesian model for the daegwallyeong and suwon stations are shown in fig 12 across scenarios an increase in the rainfall intensity is expected for scenario rcp 8 5 for the suwon station particularly for short durations while for the daegwallyeong site a reduction in the intensity is projected for scenario rcp 8 5 when compared with the historical idf curves produced by the at site bayesian model first column of fig 10 we expect a modest increase in the rainfall intensity for both sites and scenarios notably for short durations when the projected changes in future idf curves are compared with historical idfs for all sites we observe when considering an average estimate across all stations an increase in the rainfall intensity for all durations and return periods fig 13 the relative difference increases as the return period gets larger being around 18 for a 100 year return period under scenario rcp 6 it is also interesting to note that for return periods beyond 25 years the difference is larger for short durations the differences projected under scenario rcp 8 5 fig 13b are larger being around 25 for a 100 year return period event but follow similar patterns of those changes projected under scenario rcp 6 fig 13a 4 5 model application iv regional intensity duration frequency curves for historical and future climates in order to minimize noise that can be attributed to downscaled gcm rcm projections for specific sites we propose a regional idf curve using the following procedure 1 the historical rainfall for all gauged sites is used to estimate the at site posterior distributions of h and θ and the pooled estimates for ξ τ ξ 2 τ μ 2 and τ σ 2 as described before 2 using the bayesian model expressed in 23 and the estimates of ξ and τ ξ 2 obtained in step 1 we estimate regional gev location μ 24 scale σ 24 and shape ξ 24 parameters for a duration of 24 h after concatenating the observed annual maximum 24 h rainfall for all sites into a single vector 3 the regional estimates of μ d σ d and ξ d d 1 23 are estimated through the scaling relations expressed in eqs 11 12 and 13 together with the historical posterior distributions of h θ ξ τ ξ 2 τ μ 2 and τ σ 2 obtained in step 1 for α and β we use respectively the posterior distributions of log μ 24 and log σ 24 as obtained in step 2 4 the regional historical idf curve is obtained using the posterior estimates of μ d σ d and ξ d d 1 24 5 for future idf curves we first apply the bias correction procedure as previously described to obtain the future projections scenarios rcp 6 and rcp 8 5 of the annual maximum 24 h rainfall for each site we then use these projections to estimate the future regional gev parameters μ 24 σ 24 and ξ 24 as in step 2 the procedures described in steps 3 and 4 are now performed using these estimates to obtain regional future idf curves for each rcp scenario fig 14 displays the posterior distributions of μ 24 and σ 24 for the historical period and future scenarios rcp 6 and rcp 8 5 a slight shift in the location parameter μ 24 is observed for both scenarios but with no apparent differences between their projections conversely a significant increase in the scale parameter σ 24 is projected for both scenarios in the order of 30 for rcp 6 and 40 for rcp 8 5 in this sense the regionally projected changes in rainfall intensity are more associated with changes in variability rather than changes in the mean value the historical and future idf curves obtained for the regional bayesian model are shown in fig 15 for all durations and return periods we expect an increase in the extreme rainfalls in terms of relative differences fig 16 the values range from an increase of 7 for a 2 year return period in rcp 6 up to an increase of about 30 for a 100 year return period under scenario rcp 8 5 such increases now appear larger than those projected when averaging across all stations fig 13 and apparently are more constant along the rainfall duration for a fixed return period 5 discussion and summary a gev local regional bayesian model was proposed to estimate idf curves based on the scaling invariant property of the rainfall process in this context we estimate sub daily at site gev parameters for extreme rainfalls as well as for partially and ungauged sites when using estimates obtained for the 24 h rainfall and the scaling parameters h and θ the model was applied to rainfall series from 18 stations located in the han river watershed in south korea to estimate local and regional idf curves based on the historical record and the future scenarios rcp 6 and rcp 8 5 of daily maximum rainfall generated by the hadgem2 ao model the scaling property of the gev location and scale parameters with the rainfall duration were confirmed for all sites considering both ordinary gev and bayesian estimates from the proposed model the shape parameter has no observed scaling in agreement with the literature blanchet et al 2016 the uncertainty associated with the scaling estimates lead to appreciable differences between ordinary and bayesian estimates particularly for short durations the scaling parameters h and θ are well correlated but we did not observe any significant relation with the location parameter for the 24 h maximum rainfall α suggesting that we can merge the at site posterior distributions of h and θ into a single regional distribution that can be used to estimate local or regional gev parameters for short rainfall durations when only series of annual maximum 24 h rainfall are available following this procedure we obtained gev estimates for cross validated partially gauged sites that satisfactorily agree with the ordinary gev as well as with those from the proposed local bayesian model when compared with ordinary gev the bayesian model proposed here makes use of more information to estimate the parameters as it considers the scaling invariant property of rainfall in its formulation leading to a reduction in the associated uncertainty which can also be easily incorporated in the idf curves if desired idf curves derived from the local bayesian model generally follow the curves obtained from the ordinary gev model however idf curves obtained for partially gauged sites can overestimate the intensity for short durations and large return periods and this should be observed when using these curves particularly for regions where the spatial variability of rainfall is high or the target site is distant from the major ones whose rainfall data were used to estimate the scaling parameters alternatively in such circumstances we suggest to obtain regional idf curves using the model proposed in this work and utilize them for partially gauged and ungauged sites one could also explore the use of at site estimates of the scaling parameters h and θ to obtain the gev parameters of short rainfall durations for nearby partially gauged sites when considering future scenarios of rainfall for individual sites we projected an increase in the rainfall intensity particularly for rare events high return periods and under scenario rcp 8 5 however local projections might be unreliable due to the high uncertainty in the spatial variability projected by gcms in order to address this issue we proposed a bayesian model in which regional gev parameters are estimated for the 24 h maximum rainfall and the estimates of the scaling parameters are used to estimate regional parameters for shorter durations using this approach we observed that most future changes in rainfall intensity are driven by changes in the scale parameter i e we expect more variability in the extremes modest changes in the location are also expected but there is no difference between their projections from scenarios rcp 6 and rcp 8 5 the projected changes in rainfall intensity are now higher than those obtained when averaging future estimates across stations the most pronounced changes up to about 30 for scenario rcp 8 5 are again expected for rare events large return periods but interestingly for a fixed return period the magnitude of changes tends to be constant across durations contrary to what was obtained for local sites to the best of our knowledge this is the first statistical approach in the literature to estimate future changes in regional idf curves which we believe is a more pertinent approach given the high uncertainty in the way gcms simulated the spatial variability of rainfall credible intervals for the expected changes can also be easily incorporated in the regional idf curves if requested we assumed that the scaling pattern of the rainfall process and the posterior distribution of the shape parameter will remain in the future climate as estimated in the historical period this stationary assumption is crucial for the bayesian model proposed in this work and it can be hard to evaluate given the limitations of gcms to simulate sub daily rainfall the results should also be appraised in the context of the hadgem2 ao model simulations it is not clear whether such changes will be observed for different gcm simulations the physical reasons for the expected changes in future idf curves for the selected rainfall stations were not explored in this study and will be the theme of future work a regional model considering larger and more heterogeneous regions will also be explored in future works 5 1 acknowledgments this work was mainly supported by the

6929,drainage and deformation of intercalated confining layers due to internal stress change discharge recharge cycle in an aquifer aquitard system not only can have great effects on the groundwater storage gws but also can cause unsynchronized water level wl fluctuations the phase relationship between gws and wl is crucial for the accuracy and attribution of gws changes we identify the dominating episodic components of gws and wl through the singular spectrum analysis ssa analysis and harmonic analysis first we analyzed a generic aquifer aquitard system using numerical simulations which showed that the dissipation of overpressure from the aquitard and flow from it is the inherent cause of a phase shift between the gws and wl observations water released from confining layers with compaction time constant of zero no delay to century time scale results in detected phase shift between total gws and wl in the aquifer then we analyzed the complex and varied phase relationship between gws derived using the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data and measured wl time series in the subsiding north china plain ncp aquifer the spatially varied phase relationship between gws and measured wl is reasonably related to varied land subsidence development features and may be related with the compaction time constant and thickness of the confining layers results of the generic numerical model and the ncp observations suggest that elastic inelastic response need to be considered in the interpretation and correction of gws changes for a compacted aquifer aquitard system keywords groundwater storage low permeability layers land subsidence phase difference 1 introduction groundwater depletion due to over exploitation has become a worldwide issue and storage depletion of the deep confined aquifers is of particular concern due to its low renewability alley et al 2002 konikow and kendy 2005 aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 russo and lall 2017 water hold in the low permeability confining layers is also an important groundwater storage component storage change in these layers is generally accompanied by compaction due to interior stress change caused by pumping and results in land subsidence konikow and neuzil 2007 low permeability sediments are defined by vertical hydraulic conductivity of 10 8 m s neuzil 1986 the total water storage depletion in an aquifer system is the sum of three terms storage depletion in the unconfined aquifer the confined aquifer and the low permeability confining layers which can be expressed as 1 δ s gw s y δ h uc s e δ h c 2 k v s k t 1 2 δ h c where δs gw is groundwater storage depletion the first term s y δ h uc and second term s e δ h c in the right hand side are the storage depletion in the unconfined and confined aquifers respectively the third term is the volume of water released from confining layers derived by konikow and neuzil 2007 sy is the specific yield dimensionless δh uc is the drawdown in the unconfined aquifer l se is the storage coefficient of the confined aquifer dimensionless δhc is the drawdown in the confined aquifer l kv is the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the confining layer lt 1 sk is the specific storage of the confining layer l 1 and t is time t uncertainty in groundwater storage change estimates using groundwater level changes and storage parameters can be significantly increased for complex aquifers varying from unconfined to confined with large variability in storage properties spanning orders of magnitude the difficulty to determine the hydraulic conditions of aquifers where wells are penetrating may lead to misuse of storage parameters moreover low permeability confining layers are rarely monitored at a regional scale and the hydraulic properties of these layers are generally poorly understood time variable gravity changes from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission tapley et al 2004 have been used widely to investigate groundwater storage gws due to climate change and human activity over continental and basin scales for assessing long term trends e g rodell et al 2007 strassberg et al 2007 famiglietti et al 2011 feng et al 2013 long et al 2013 tang et al 2013 voss et al 2013 chen et al 2014 the grace data provide integrated total terrestrial storage tws change in surface water soil water snow mass and groundwater and the errors in the estimates of these water balance terms will be unavoidably introduced into the grace derived gws scanlon et al 2012 complex processing steps and uncertainties in water balance terms make it necessary to validate grace derived gws using ground monitoring data that are generally treated as the true gws information rodell et al 2007 strassberg et al 2007 strassberg et al 2009 scanlon et al 2012 feng et al 2013 castle et al 2014 bhanja et al 2016 the same filtering process applied to the grace data can be applied to this true gws information to calculate a multiplicative factor which is used to restore the small spatial signals removed by filtering e g klees et al 2007 scanlon et al 2012 huang et al 2015 good correlation between gws calculated using grace and wl data can be found for some aquifers which have less storage components and simple hydraulic conditions e g strassberg et al 2007 strassberg et al 2009 since statistical correlation mainly measure the match in timing with respect to phase and periodicity besides the magnitude difference the phase difference between grace derived gws and the true prior information in situ wl measurements is important for bias error correction klees et al 2007 groundwater storage change is mostly affected by groundwater irrigation at seasonal time scale the phase difference between gws and groundwater levels wl data is critical for seasonal gws estimation using wl and validation of grace derived gws it has been shown that there may be phase difference among the gws and wl associated with the time delay in the groundwater recharge mechanisms related with unsaturated flow transferring moisture and groundwater flow dissipating perturbations in the recharge zone chen et al 2005 tocho et al 2012 rousseau gueutin et al 2013 neglecting water flow will cause phase difference among the derived gws time series pereira et al 2012 jin and feng 2013 if the gws change due to pumping is thought as an instantaneous change the flow regime in a compacted aquifer system is in disequilibrium state associated with dissipating of disequilibrium type abnormal pressure neuzil 1995 monitored land subsidence can provide a good constrain on the amount of storage change in these confining layers and it has been shown that local groundwater storage change related to land subsidence may not be well reflected by grace data due to its coarse spatial resolution the effects of delayed compaction of the clay layer on amplitude of groundwater level fluctuations measured in wells tapping the aquifer has been well investigated hoffmann et al 2003a however the phase relationship between gws and wl for the compacted aquifer system has received little attention this study aims to 1 scrutinize the inherent process causing any phase shift between gws and wl through numerical simulation of a synthetic compacted aquifer system and 2 to demonstrate the complex phase relationship between grace based gws change and observed wl in a real regional aquifer system the north china plain that has been suffering severe land subsidence 2 numerical experiments for a synthetic aquifer system 2 1 theoretical model the theoretical model is to scrutinize the processes leading to phase shift between gws and wl therefore we simulate a simplified layered aquifer system while acknowledging that an aquifer system often have multiple low permeability layers the theoretical model used in this study is modified from the simulation sample problem no 2 of hoffmann et al 2003b to demonstrate the effects of seasonally fluctuating pumping on the groundwater level variations in the aquifer the compaction system consists of a hypothetical confined aquifer and an intercalated clay layer the model setup is shown in fig 1 and parameters are summarized in table 1 a laterally extensive confining clay layer is interbedded in a confined aquifer no flow boundaries were specified on the sides and bottom of the cell using recharge applied at the cell top to represent possibly receiving lateral flow and vertical leakage although the model is a generalized representation seasonally fluctuated patterns of pumping and recharge rates in a real aquifer system see fig s1 from cao et al 2013 were used to set the sinks sources the annual discharge recharge cycle is repeated five times first in the simulation and pumping is stopped positive recharge remains for the subsequent five years to test the variations in groundwater storage and water level in response to recovery in groundwater storage initial groundwater level and pre consolidation head are specified as 0 m groundwater storage change in the aquifer aquitard was simulated using the subsidence package sub moflow hoffmann et al 2003b the simulated compaction and elastic storage change in the aquifer are added together to represent the total gws the equilibrium hydraulic heads in clay layers are typically lagging behind head changes in the surrounding aquifer and the time delay caused by slow dissipation of overpressure can be expressed by a time constant hoffmann et al 2003b 2 τ b 2 2 s sk k v where b is the thickness of the clay layer l ssk is the skeletal specific storage l 1 and kv is the vertical hydraulic conductivity lt 1 the time constant is the time required for 93 of ultimate compaction to occur galloway et al 1998 inclusion of the delayed drainage would cause larger water level fluctuations but has little effect on land subsidence leake 1990 hoffmann et al 2003b the confining layer is simulated for a no delay case and cases with the time constant magnitude ranging from 10 to 1000 years 14 140 and 1400 years see table 2 to investigate the different response of phase relationship between gws and wl 2 2 groundwater level variations in the inelastic elastic deformation cycle for the compacted aquifer system dominated by inelastic storage change the variations of gws change are exactly the same for no delay and delayed confining layers as they are controlled by the pumping and recharge variations but the water level variations in the bounded aquifers are of great difference fig 2 for the aquifer system containing no delay confining layer the storage change is following the elastic inelastic e i cycle during the early stage of pumping most of pumpage is contributed by elastic storage and when water level decreases below the pre consolidation head the lowest water level in the previous pumping cycle the elastic storage change is replaced by inelastic storage unrecoverable compaction of the confining layer fig 2a the existence of the e i cycle results in apparent lag of the gws relative to the wl changes time series for the no delay case fig 2c water released from confining layer storage causes differently timed turning points for the wl and gws changes series the turning point in the wl changes series is the break point at the e i interface when the pre consolidation head is updated to a lower position the beginning time of the dominant pumping period while the turning point in the gws changes series is the slope break point in the inelastic storage change period the ending time of the dominant pumping period in the inelastic storage change period the rate of storage change in confining layers increases while the storage change rate in the aquifer has declined delayed drainage results in greater wl variations compared with the no delay case fig 2b and d for confining layers in which drainage is delayed relative more elastic storage depletion of the aquifer will occur in the early stage of the inelastic period as drainage of the confining layer is delayed and at the late stage of the inelastic stage contribution from by residual delayed compaction results in increase of water level and no any rebound in land subsidence can be found fig 2b as the positions of the troughs of the gws changes series will not move the time of turning point in wl change series will move forward shortening the shift between the troughs of the wl and gws changes series in the subsequent several discharge recharge cycles fig 2d the number of discharge recharge cycles affected by the delayed compaction depends on the time constant of confining layer according to its definition the wl variations will increase with larger delay time constant larger time constant means that smaller compaction occurs in the pumping period and relatively more pumping contribution from elastic storage represented by greater water level decline but delayed residual compaction of clay layers facilitates water level increasing in the water level recovery period 2 3 phase difference between gws and groundwater level variations because the compaction of the delayed confining layer has a delay response to water level change in the bounding aquifer lag correlation coefficients are used to measure the strength of association between the total groundwater storage gws change and water level wl lag correlation analysis of the wl and total gws anomaly series shows that among the tested no delay case and all cases accounting for delayed confining layer the no delay case and cases with time constant in magnitude of tens to hundreds years have low correlation correlation coefficient r of 0 60 to 0 70 table 2 the case with time constant in magnitude of thousands of years has the highest correlation r of 0 9 larger time constant means that the shift between the troughs of the wl and gws changes series will be cut shorter and the duration of this effect will be longer the 3 months timing shift the length of the dominant pumping period between the troughs of wl and gws changes for the no delay case has been shorten to zero for the τ of 1400 years case in all simulated discharge recharge cycles the correlation analysis results indicate that the amplitude and phase relationship between gws and wl will not only depends on hydraulic parameters but also is related with the study period as the wl and gws anomaly series consist of long term trends and annual periodic components due to seasonal pumping the annual periodic components are extracted see following 3 3 and then are applied the harmonic analysis see following 3 4 to investigate the phase difference between the two periodic series for delayed confining layer the residual compaction transfers water storage from confining layers to aquifer without total storage change affected and the effects on groundwater level variations in the pumped aquifer depend on the time span of this process for the no delay case and cases with τ in magnitude of tens to hundreds years gws anomaly have noticeable lags behind the wl anomaly for the extracted annual periodic components in the pumping period fig 3 a c this phase shift of about 1 month 30 degree in the periodic components may explain the low correlation coefficients when the value of τ is in magnitude of thousands of years the correlation coefficient is about 0 90 and the phase difference decreases fig 3d table 2 this value is similar to the obtained correlation coefficient between grace derived and wl based gws for real unconfined aquifers e g strassberg et al 2009 it would be expected that larger delay time constant which means relatively more contribution from the bounding aquifer to pumping and would result in higher correlation between wl and gws an aquifer system which does not contain delayed confining layers can be treated as a extreme case of an infinite time constant and the compaction in the specific study period can be ignored when pumping is stopped wl series have become in phase with gws series fig 3 after a short time also indicating that the phase difference between wl and gws may vary with time this suggests that the phase relationship between gws and wl for a subsiding aquifer system is time dependent and the stress history of the system is necessary to be examined for gws estimation the complex relationship between wl and gws series will be demonstrated for a real aquifer system in the following section 3 case of the north china plain findings from the numerical experiments for the above empirical model suggest that the phase difference between gws and wl is affected by the characteristic time of the confining layers and therefore by the storage properties and thickness of the clay layers additionally the phase difference may be related with the compaction history of confining layers the north china plain ncp has suffered severe land subsidence due to long term groundwater over exploitation for agriculture development the highly heterogeneous aquifer system of the ncp along with the uneven groundwater withdrawal result in great spatial difference in land subsidence therefore the ncp is an ideal system to investigate the phase relationship between gws and wl affected by compaction of confining clay layers grace derived gws is used to represent the groundwater storage variations and any groundwater irrigation pumpage change may also be reflected by the seasonal gws variations 3 1 land subsidence and groundwater storage change in the ncp the ncp refers to the plains of the haihe river basin hrb in northern china fig 4 and the quaternary aquifer of the ncp is one of the world s largest aquifer systems foster et al 2004 the ncp is one of the primary crop production regions in china and long term extensive groundwater fed irrigation has caused continued groundwater depletion with dire consequences for the economic development and food security of china e g zheng et al 2010 cao et al 2013 excessive deep groundwater extraction has resulted in severe land subsidence in the ncp e g zhang et al 2013 guo et al 2015 which has become one of the three primary subsiding regions in china land subsidence in the ncp began in the 1950 s and by the end of 2010 the total volume of subsidence was estimated 42 90 km3 over a total subsiding area of 7 56 104 km2 60 of the ncp area which is equivalent to pure water thickness of 0 57 m or an annual compaction of 14 0 mm across the plain averaged in the past four decades the mean annual exploitation of confined deep groundwater in the ncp is approximately 2 5 km3 since the 1970 s which is equivalent of 18 0 mm of water across the ncp cao et al 2013 it is reasonable to assume that observed land subsidence is equivalent to the volume of groundwater depletion in the confining layers konikow and neuzil 2007 therefore the monitored subsidence volume indicates that 80 of deep groundwater extraction would be from compaction of the confining layers several previous studies have attempted to use grace to estimate gws change in the ncp while neglecting reservoir storage change moiwo et al 2009 su et al 2011 feng et al 2013 shen et al 2014 huang et al 2015 and a wide range of 8 22 mm yr for the gws change rates has been reported table 3 however none of those previous studies has included the groundwater depletion due to compaction of the aquifer system as a water balance component when quantifying groundwater storage change using grace this comparable value range with the land subsidence rate may indicate that there is still uncertainty respect to the grace derived gws as the in situ groundwater level measurements should be non reliable to estimate the gws change and validate the grace results for such a subsiding aquifer system tang et al 2013 suggested that the mass signal of grace derived gws may be offset greatly by surface water storage change associated with reservoirs and coal mass transfer the surface water system has been affected greatly by dams in the ncp and the storage of the 150 large reservoirs in the ncp varied in capacity between 5 0 and 10 0 km3 in 2002 2012 the storage of the largest lake in the ncp baiyangdian lake has been less than 4 0 km3 since 1997 and reached a peak at 4 6 km3 at the end of 2013 the signals in surface water are likely much smaller than storage loss associated with aquifer system compaction huang et al 2015 estimated the groundwater depletion in the east central plain region of the ncp roughly coinciding with the subsiding area at about 17 mm yr utilizing a forward modeling method to correct bias error of the grace the aquifer system in the ncp consists of an unconfined aquifer underlain by a series of confined sand aquifers interbeded by clay lenses layers in the piedmont plain region approximately 30 km wide from the taihang and yan mountains front clay layers are rare and shallow and deep parts of the aquifer are highly hydraulic connected the temporal land subsidence variations in the ncp show different local patterns in the dezhou land subsidence center insar based land subsidence shows seasonal variation trend subsidence occurring in spring and summer february august and obvious rebound occurring in autumn and winter september to january of next year ge et al 2014 these temporal subsidence variations indicate small compaction delay of the aquifer system and possible recharge in wet season in contrast in the beijing land subsidence center land subsidence doesn t show decreasing or rebound corresponding to water level increase in wet seasons yang et al 2013 3 2 in situ water level measurements and grace data groundwater level in situ measurements are obtained from the national groundwater monitoring network of china monitoring wells are grouped as shallow and deep wells according to their screen locations in the unconfined or confined cao et al 2013 monthly groundwater level changes were first calculated from the original groundwater level time series and then were converted to anomalies with respect to the mean value of 2004 2009 the groundwater anomalies for shallow and deep wells are averaged separately across the ncp to investigate any phase difference between them because land subsidence in the ncp is primarily caused by compaction of the confined aquifer system only groundwater levels in confined aquifers were used in the phase difference analysis between groundwater level and gws groundwater anomalies for deep wells fig 5 are averaged over a 1 1 degree mesh where each grid of the mesh is assigned the mean value of all wells within it the phase information in the grace and water level time series is most of interest in this study the phase shift associated with spatial smoothing is generally less than 0 5 months 15 degree chen et al 2007 klees et al 2007 therefore the bias error and uncertainty mostly associated with amplitude in the grace data processing were not investigated processed estimates of tws anomalies from grace land mass grids swenson and wahr 2006 landerer and swenson 2012 at 1 0 degree resolution were obtained from january 2004 to december 2010 data since 2011 is not used for spectral analysis due to gaps associated with battery aging the soil water storage sws is estimated by using the noah model simulation from nasa s global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 with 1 0 degree resolution the residuals of scaled grace subtracted by gldas grace gldas represent the gws anomalies in the ncp ignoring surface water storage as most previous studies the sws estimated by the gldas may have considerable uncertainties among several land surface models in the gldas such as noah vic clm2 etc however the objective of this study is not to obtain the exact phase or amount of gws derived from the grace glads but to investigate relative spatial difference in the phase characteristics therefore only noah model is used in this study and no further validation of gldas based sms was carried out 3 3 singular spectrum analysis of gws anomalies in this study the singular spectrum analysis ssa analysis was applied to decompose the gws and wl time series into the long term trend the periodic components and high frequency noise fig 6 trend and periodic components are generally extracted by least squares fitting of a trend term and harmonic terms with constant amplitude and phase jin and feng 2013 huang et al 2015 however these seasonal signals may have a time variable amplitude and phase moreover the first two order polynomial functions to represent the trend cannot effectively capture the nonlinear trend the ssa is a non parametric method which does not require a prior knowledge of the dynamics affecting the time series with benefits that trends obtained in this way are not necessarily linear and true oscillations can be amplitude and phase modulated the ssa mtm toolkit ghil et al 2002 was applied to the monthly data time series for extracting the trend term and the dominant periodic components singular spectrum analysis ssa is a modified form of principal component analysis pca in the vector space of delay coordinates for a time series ssa decomposes the raw hydrologic time series into temporal principal components pcs vautard et al 1992 ghil et al 2002 because the pcs do not contain the phase information of the time series oscillatory modes and noise are reconstructed by using linear combinations of the pcs and orthogonal functions eofs to create the reconstructed components rcs vautard et al 1992 ghil et al 2002 no information is lost during the reconstruction process because the sum of the individual rcs is equal to the original time series the gws and wl anomalies averaged across the ncp are firstly investigated fig 6 the first eight accounting for 90 of total variance reconstructed components rcs are the significant terms in the grace derived gws time series table 4 fig s2 the sum of the first two low frequency rcs rcs1 2 is the nonlinear trend component fig 6a the nonlinear trend of the gws represents the storage change related with climatic change and the effects of long term human activities e g long term groundwater overexploitation the sum of the annual cycle pair signals rcs3 4 can be explained by groundwater storage change caused by the seasonal pumping cycle fig 6b smaller amplitude of the annual periodic oscillation likely reflect smaller gws caused by reduced groundwater irrigation pumpage accompanied by water level recovery the rest of rcs are high frequency signals containing semi annual variations see fig s2 3 4 phase analysis of gws and groundwater level anomalies the non linear trend identified using the ssa analysis was subtracted from each time series and then harmonic analysis was then applied the annual and semi annual periodic components to determine the phase a modified sinusoidal model bell et al 2008 including annual and semi annual harmonic terms was used to fit each the de trend time series 3 δ h t a a 1 cos 2 π t 1 t π ϕ 1 180 a 2 cos 2 π t 2 t π ϕ 2 180 where δh t is the fitted time series t is time in unit of month a is a constant shift of the model due to noise a 1 t 1 ϕ 1 are amplitude period in unit of month and phase in unit of degree for the annual cycle harmonic terms a 2 t 2 ϕ 2 are for the semi annual periodic terms the periodic annual components of gws and shallow and deep wl time series have small phase shifts during the period of 2004 2007 fig 6b the periodic components for the period 2008 2010 were not well determined and a significant decrease was shown in the amplitude the observed aquifer system compaction and groundwater level time series also have shown phase shift at the subsiding area fig 6c the noticeable land subsidence rebound indicates that this phase shift is highly likely associated with the no delay compaction of the clay layers among the four primary land subsidence centers in the ncp fig 7 land rebound can only be observed in dezhou the skeletal specific storage vertical hydraulic conductivity and thickness of the aquitard determine its delay features the thickness of the quaternary aquifer system in the ncp is 300 500 m containing clay layers with thickness ranging from 0 to 300 m and greater than 50 m in the land subsidence region the reported hydraulic parameters of aquitard in the ncp are generally determined by stress strain diagram using borehole extensometer records and groundwater hydrographs from piezometers and by laboratory tests inverse modeling using regional insar monitored land subsidence and benchmark data or borehole extensometer data is widely used to estimate hydraulic parameters of aquitard however to the authors knowledge no studies have used inverse modeling to estimate aquitard parameters in the ncp the reported hydraulic parameters of aquitard in the ncp has been summarized in table 5 given the representative ranges of skeletal specific storage 10 5 10 3 1 m and hydraulic conductivity 10 7 10 5 m d table 5 of the clay interbeds most of 5 20 m thick in the ncp see fig s3 the time constant for clay interbeds in the ncp ranges in days nearly no delay to about three thousands of years the combined effects of delayed and no delay compaction and the wide range of time constant will complicate the phase relationship between gws and wl therefore the phase of gws and wl is further investigated at each grid point see fig s4 the phase difference obtained from gws minus deep wl phases shows notable local characteristics fig 8 the phase differences are 12 116 degrees for the annual periodic components and 1 170 degrees for the semi annual cycles if not considering leading or lagging fig 8 see fig s5 the primary irrigation season for winter wheat in the ncp is the spring irrigation that generally begins in mid march and stops in may the length of this primary pumping period suggests that a phase difference around 90 degrees 3 months might be reasonable the two grid points showing nearly in phase phase shift about 10 degrees in annual components of gws and wl are located in the coastal plain around tianjin and cangzhou fig 8b areas underlain by thick fine grained deposits guo et al 2015 land subsidence in tianjin has occurred earliest in the ncp since the 1920 s and the land subsidence rate has declined since the 1990 s due to regulations of groundwater pumping guo et al 2015 fig 7 the grid points around dezhou and hengshui show 270 degrees equivalent to 90 degrees ignoring leading or lagging phase shift between gws and wl fig 8b and greater amplitude in wl anomalies than tianjin and cangzhou see fig s6 possibly due to the relatively thinner clay thickness and its smaller compaction time constant these observations are also consistent with the numerical test cases in that larger phase shift could be found in the early stage of compaction of the aquifer system containing delayed confining layers huang et al 2015 used a single factor for each sub region in the ncp to correct the bias error and suggested that the time series would be more feasible for leakage error correction according to this way of thinking the spatially varied phase relationship between gws and wl due to aquifer heterogeneity and differences in and human activities must be valuable to improve the grace data processing and extend its applications 4 discussion and conclusions groundwater storage loss due to compaction of the confining layers is an unavoidable factor when using groundwater level observations to estimate gws and validate the grace derived gws in a subsiding area for both amplitude and phase signals although accurate land subsidence measurements can reasonably represent storage change in the confining layers the phase shift between wl and gws can be a common phenomenon in a subsiding aquifer and must be analyzed carefully considering the aquifer heterogeneity and stress history the varied amplitude of wl variations and phase relationship between gws and wl for the same gws changes series demonstrates that the grace estimates of terrestrial storage change cannot be validated solely by groundwater level observations in a subsiding area the phase relationship between gws and wl are related with the compaction characteristics of the confining layer and is time dependent stress strain analysis should be carried out to determine the stage of the compaction and aquifer system characteristics considering that fully integrating all the process related with infiltration and recharge mechanisms is still difficult in the grace analysis due to the difficulty to present the storage in the deep unsaturated zone huang et al 2012 and local hydrological effects e g mäkinen et al 2014 high resolution field based groundwater level monitoring is still necessary to evaluate and improve the grace based gws estimates hydrostratigraphy and groundwater flow modeling are necessary to present the transient response of the groundwater system to pumping and provide the most accurate prior information both in amplitude and phase reliable estimates of gws variations where multiple storage components are present like the ncp require strong integration of space and

6929,drainage and deformation of intercalated confining layers due to internal stress change discharge recharge cycle in an aquifer aquitard system not only can have great effects on the groundwater storage gws but also can cause unsynchronized water level wl fluctuations the phase relationship between gws and wl is crucial for the accuracy and attribution of gws changes we identify the dominating episodic components of gws and wl through the singular spectrum analysis ssa analysis and harmonic analysis first we analyzed a generic aquifer aquitard system using numerical simulations which showed that the dissipation of overpressure from the aquitard and flow from it is the inherent cause of a phase shift between the gws and wl observations water released from confining layers with compaction time constant of zero no delay to century time scale results in detected phase shift between total gws and wl in the aquifer then we analyzed the complex and varied phase relationship between gws derived using the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data and measured wl time series in the subsiding north china plain ncp aquifer the spatially varied phase relationship between gws and measured wl is reasonably related to varied land subsidence development features and may be related with the compaction time constant and thickness of the confining layers results of the generic numerical model and the ncp observations suggest that elastic inelastic response need to be considered in the interpretation and correction of gws changes for a compacted aquifer aquitard system keywords groundwater storage low permeability layers land subsidence phase difference 1 introduction groundwater depletion due to over exploitation has become a worldwide issue and storage depletion of the deep confined aquifers is of particular concern due to its low renewability alley et al 2002 konikow and kendy 2005 aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 russo and lall 2017 water hold in the low permeability confining layers is also an important groundwater storage component storage change in these layers is generally accompanied by compaction due to interior stress change caused by pumping and results in land subsidence konikow and neuzil 2007 low permeability sediments are defined by vertical hydraulic conductivity of 10 8 m s neuzil 1986 the total water storage depletion in an aquifer system is the sum of three terms storage depletion in the unconfined aquifer the confined aquifer and the low permeability confining layers which can be expressed as 1 δ s gw s y δ h uc s e δ h c 2 k v s k t 1 2 δ h c where δs gw is groundwater storage depletion the first term s y δ h uc and second term s e δ h c in the right hand side are the storage depletion in the unconfined and confined aquifers respectively the third term is the volume of water released from confining layers derived by konikow and neuzil 2007 sy is the specific yield dimensionless δh uc is the drawdown in the unconfined aquifer l se is the storage coefficient of the confined aquifer dimensionless δhc is the drawdown in the confined aquifer l kv is the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the confining layer lt 1 sk is the specific storage of the confining layer l 1 and t is time t uncertainty in groundwater storage change estimates using groundwater level changes and storage parameters can be significantly increased for complex aquifers varying from unconfined to confined with large variability in storage properties spanning orders of magnitude the difficulty to determine the hydraulic conditions of aquifers where wells are penetrating may lead to misuse of storage parameters moreover low permeability confining layers are rarely monitored at a regional scale and the hydraulic properties of these layers are generally poorly understood time variable gravity changes from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission tapley et al 2004 have been used widely to investigate groundwater storage gws due to climate change and human activity over continental and basin scales for assessing long term trends e g rodell et al 2007 strassberg et al 2007 famiglietti et al 2011 feng et al 2013 long et al 2013 tang et al 2013 voss et al 2013 chen et al 2014 the grace data provide integrated total terrestrial storage tws change in surface water soil water snow mass and groundwater and the errors in the estimates of these water balance terms will be unavoidably introduced into the grace derived gws scanlon et al 2012 complex processing steps and uncertainties in water balance terms make it necessary to validate grace derived gws using ground monitoring data that are generally treated as the true gws information rodell et al 2007 strassberg et al 2007 strassberg et al 2009 scanlon et al 2012 feng et al 2013 castle et al 2014 bhanja et al 2016 the same filtering process applied to the grace data can be applied to this true gws information to calculate a multiplicative factor which is used to restore the small spatial signals removed by filtering e g klees et al 2007 scanlon et al 2012 huang et al 2015 good correlation between gws calculated using grace and wl data can be found for some aquifers which have less storage components and simple hydraulic conditions e g strassberg et al 2007 strassberg et al 2009 since statistical correlation mainly measure the match in timing with respect to phase and periodicity besides the magnitude difference the phase difference between grace derived gws and the true prior information in situ wl measurements is important for bias error correction klees et al 2007 groundwater storage change is mostly affected by groundwater irrigation at seasonal time scale the phase difference between gws and groundwater levels wl data is critical for seasonal gws estimation using wl and validation of grace derived gws it has been shown that there may be phase difference among the gws and wl associated with the time delay in the groundwater recharge mechanisms related with unsaturated flow transferring moisture and groundwater flow dissipating perturbations in the recharge zone chen et al 2005 tocho et al 2012 rousseau gueutin et al 2013 neglecting water flow will cause phase difference among the derived gws time series pereira et al 2012 jin and feng 2013 if the gws change due to pumping is thought as an instantaneous change the flow regime in a compacted aquifer system is in disequilibrium state associated with dissipating of disequilibrium type abnormal pressure neuzil 1995 monitored land subsidence can provide a good constrain on the amount of storage change in these confining layers and it has been shown that local groundwater storage change related to land subsidence may not be well reflected by grace data due to its coarse spatial resolution the effects of delayed compaction of the clay layer on amplitude of groundwater level fluctuations measured in wells tapping the aquifer has been well investigated hoffmann et al 2003a however the phase relationship between gws and wl for the compacted aquifer system has received little attention this study aims to 1 scrutinize the inherent process causing any phase shift between gws and wl through numerical simulation of a synthetic compacted aquifer system and 2 to demonstrate the complex phase relationship between grace based gws change and observed wl in a real regional aquifer system the north china plain that has been suffering severe land subsidence 2 numerical experiments for a synthetic aquifer system 2 1 theoretical model the theoretical model is to scrutinize the processes leading to phase shift between gws and wl therefore we simulate a simplified layered aquifer system while acknowledging that an aquifer system often have multiple low permeability layers the theoretical model used in this study is modified from the simulation sample problem no 2 of hoffmann et al 2003b to demonstrate the effects of seasonally fluctuating pumping on the groundwater level variations in the aquifer the compaction system consists of a hypothetical confined aquifer and an intercalated clay layer the model setup is shown in fig 1 and parameters are summarized in table 1 a laterally extensive confining clay layer is interbedded in a confined aquifer no flow boundaries were specified on the sides and bottom of the cell using recharge applied at the cell top to represent possibly receiving lateral flow and vertical leakage although the model is a generalized representation seasonally fluctuated patterns of pumping and recharge rates in a real aquifer system see fig s1 from cao et al 2013 were used to set the sinks sources the annual discharge recharge cycle is repeated five times first in the simulation and pumping is stopped positive recharge remains for the subsequent five years to test the variations in groundwater storage and water level in response to recovery in groundwater storage initial groundwater level and pre consolidation head are specified as 0 m groundwater storage change in the aquifer aquitard was simulated using the subsidence package sub moflow hoffmann et al 2003b the simulated compaction and elastic storage change in the aquifer are added together to represent the total gws the equilibrium hydraulic heads in clay layers are typically lagging behind head changes in the surrounding aquifer and the time delay caused by slow dissipation of overpressure can be expressed by a time constant hoffmann et al 2003b 2 τ b 2 2 s sk k v where b is the thickness of the clay layer l ssk is the skeletal specific storage l 1 and kv is the vertical hydraulic conductivity lt 1 the time constant is the time required for 93 of ultimate compaction to occur galloway et al 1998 inclusion of the delayed drainage would cause larger water level fluctuations but has little effect on land subsidence leake 1990 hoffmann et al 2003b the confining layer is simulated for a no delay case and cases with the time constant magnitude ranging from 10 to 1000 years 14 140 and 1400 years see table 2 to investigate the different response of phase relationship between gws and wl 2 2 groundwater level variations in the inelastic elastic deformation cycle for the compacted aquifer system dominated by inelastic storage change the variations of gws change are exactly the same for no delay and delayed confining layers as they are controlled by the pumping and recharge variations but the water level variations in the bounded aquifers are of great difference fig 2 for the aquifer system containing no delay confining layer the storage change is following the elastic inelastic e i cycle during the early stage of pumping most of pumpage is contributed by elastic storage and when water level decreases below the pre consolidation head the lowest water level in the previous pumping cycle the elastic storage change is replaced by inelastic storage unrecoverable compaction of the confining layer fig 2a the existence of the e i cycle results in apparent lag of the gws relative to the wl changes time series for the no delay case fig 2c water released from confining layer storage causes differently timed turning points for the wl and gws changes series the turning point in the wl changes series is the break point at the e i interface when the pre consolidation head is updated to a lower position the beginning time of the dominant pumping period while the turning point in the gws changes series is the slope break point in the inelastic storage change period the ending time of the dominant pumping period in the inelastic storage change period the rate of storage change in confining layers increases while the storage change rate in the aquifer has declined delayed drainage results in greater wl variations compared with the no delay case fig 2b and d for confining layers in which drainage is delayed relative more elastic storage depletion of the aquifer will occur in the early stage of the inelastic period as drainage of the confining layer is delayed and at the late stage of the inelastic stage contribution from by residual delayed compaction results in increase of water level and no any rebound in land subsidence can be found fig 2b as the positions of the troughs of the gws changes series will not move the time of turning point in wl change series will move forward shortening the shift between the troughs of the wl and gws changes series in the subsequent several discharge recharge cycles fig 2d the number of discharge recharge cycles affected by the delayed compaction depends on the time constant of confining layer according to its definition the wl variations will increase with larger delay time constant larger time constant means that smaller compaction occurs in the pumping period and relatively more pumping contribution from elastic storage represented by greater water level decline but delayed residual compaction of clay layers facilitates water level increasing in the water level recovery period 2 3 phase difference between gws and groundwater level variations because the compaction of the delayed confining layer has a delay response to water level change in the bounding aquifer lag correlation coefficients are used to measure the strength of association between the total groundwater storage gws change and water level wl lag correlation analysis of the wl and total gws anomaly series shows that among the tested no delay case and all cases accounting for delayed confining layer the no delay case and cases with time constant in magnitude of tens to hundreds years have low correlation correlation coefficient r of 0 60 to 0 70 table 2 the case with time constant in magnitude of thousands of years has the highest correlation r of 0 9 larger time constant means that the shift between the troughs of the wl and gws changes series will be cut shorter and the duration of this effect will be longer the 3 months timing shift the length of the dominant pumping period between the troughs of wl and gws changes for the no delay case has been shorten to zero for the τ of 1400 years case in all simulated discharge recharge cycles the correlation analysis results indicate that the amplitude and phase relationship between gws and wl will not only depends on hydraulic parameters but also is related with the study period as the wl and gws anomaly series consist of long term trends and annual periodic components due to seasonal pumping the annual periodic components are extracted see following 3 3 and then are applied the harmonic analysis see following 3 4 to investigate the phase difference between the two periodic series for delayed confining layer the residual compaction transfers water storage from confining layers to aquifer without total storage change affected and the effects on groundwater level variations in the pumped aquifer depend on the time span of this process for the no delay case and cases with τ in magnitude of tens to hundreds years gws anomaly have noticeable lags behind the wl anomaly for the extracted annual periodic components in the pumping period fig 3 a c this phase shift of about 1 month 30 degree in the periodic components may explain the low correlation coefficients when the value of τ is in magnitude of thousands of years the correlation coefficient is about 0 90 and the phase difference decreases fig 3d table 2 this value is similar to the obtained correlation coefficient between grace derived and wl based gws for real unconfined aquifers e g strassberg et al 2009 it would be expected that larger delay time constant which means relatively more contribution from the bounding aquifer to pumping and would result in higher correlation between wl and gws an aquifer system which does not contain delayed confining layers can be treated as a extreme case of an infinite time constant and the compaction in the specific study period can be ignored when pumping is stopped wl series have become in phase with gws series fig 3 after a short time also indicating that the phase difference between wl and gws may vary with time this suggests that the phase relationship between gws and wl for a subsiding aquifer system is time dependent and the stress history of the system is necessary to be examined for gws estimation the complex relationship between wl and gws series will be demonstrated for a real aquifer system in the following section 3 case of the north china plain findings from the numerical experiments for the above empirical model suggest that the phase difference between gws and wl is affected by the characteristic time of the confining layers and therefore by the storage properties and thickness of the clay layers additionally the phase difference may be related with the compaction history of confining layers the north china plain ncp has suffered severe land subsidence due to long term groundwater over exploitation for agriculture development the highly heterogeneous aquifer system of the ncp along with the uneven groundwater withdrawal result in great spatial difference in land subsidence therefore the ncp is an ideal system to investigate the phase relationship between gws and wl affected by compaction of confining clay layers grace derived gws is used to represent the groundwater storage variations and any groundwater irrigation pumpage change may also be reflected by the seasonal gws variations 3 1 land subsidence and groundwater storage change in the ncp the ncp refers to the plains of the haihe river basin hrb in northern china fig 4 and the quaternary aquifer of the ncp is one of the world s largest aquifer systems foster et al 2004 the ncp is one of the primary crop production regions in china and long term extensive groundwater fed irrigation has caused continued groundwater depletion with dire consequences for the economic development and food security of china e g zheng et al 2010 cao et al 2013 excessive deep groundwater extraction has resulted in severe land subsidence in the ncp e g zhang et al 2013 guo et al 2015 which has become one of the three primary subsiding regions in china land subsidence in the ncp began in the 1950 s and by the end of 2010 the total volume of subsidence was estimated 42 90 km3 over a total subsiding area of 7 56 104 km2 60 of the ncp area which is equivalent to pure water thickness of 0 57 m or an annual compaction of 14 0 mm across the plain averaged in the past four decades the mean annual exploitation of confined deep groundwater in the ncp is approximately 2 5 km3 since the 1970 s which is equivalent of 18 0 mm of water across the ncp cao et al 2013 it is reasonable to assume that observed land subsidence is equivalent to the volume of groundwater depletion in the confining layers konikow and neuzil 2007 therefore the monitored subsidence volume indicates that 80 of deep groundwater extraction would be from compaction of the confining layers several previous studies have attempted to use grace to estimate gws change in the ncp while neglecting reservoir storage change moiwo et al 2009 su et al 2011 feng et al 2013 shen et al 2014 huang et al 2015 and a wide range of 8 22 mm yr for the gws change rates has been reported table 3 however none of those previous studies has included the groundwater depletion due to compaction of the aquifer system as a water balance component when quantifying groundwater storage change using grace this comparable value range with the land subsidence rate may indicate that there is still uncertainty respect to the grace derived gws as the in situ groundwater level measurements should be non reliable to estimate the gws change and validate the grace results for such a subsiding aquifer system tang et al 2013 suggested that the mass signal of grace derived gws may be offset greatly by surface water storage change associated with reservoirs and coal mass transfer the surface water system has been affected greatly by dams in the ncp and the storage of the 150 large reservoirs in the ncp varied in capacity between 5 0 and 10 0 km3 in 2002 2012 the storage of the largest lake in the ncp baiyangdian lake has been less than 4 0 km3 since 1997 and reached a peak at 4 6 km3 at the end of 2013 the signals in surface water are likely much smaller than storage loss associated with aquifer system compaction huang et al 2015 estimated the groundwater depletion in the east central plain region of the ncp roughly coinciding with the subsiding area at about 17 mm yr utilizing a forward modeling method to correct bias error of the grace the aquifer system in the ncp consists of an unconfined aquifer underlain by a series of confined sand aquifers interbeded by clay lenses layers in the piedmont plain region approximately 30 km wide from the taihang and yan mountains front clay layers are rare and shallow and deep parts of the aquifer are highly hydraulic connected the temporal land subsidence variations in the ncp show different local patterns in the dezhou land subsidence center insar based land subsidence shows seasonal variation trend subsidence occurring in spring and summer february august and obvious rebound occurring in autumn and winter september to january of next year ge et al 2014 these temporal subsidence variations indicate small compaction delay of the aquifer system and possible recharge in wet season in contrast in the beijing land subsidence center land subsidence doesn t show decreasing or rebound corresponding to water level increase in wet seasons yang et al 2013 3 2 in situ water level measurements and grace data groundwater level in situ measurements are obtained from the national groundwater monitoring network of china monitoring wells are grouped as shallow and deep wells according to their screen locations in the unconfined or confined cao et al 2013 monthly groundwater level changes were first calculated from the original groundwater level time series and then were converted to anomalies with respect to the mean value of 2004 2009 the groundwater anomalies for shallow and deep wells are averaged separately across the ncp to investigate any phase difference between them because land subsidence in the ncp is primarily caused by compaction of the confined aquifer system only groundwater levels in confined aquifers were used in the phase difference analysis between groundwater level and gws groundwater anomalies for deep wells fig 5 are averaged over a 1 1 degree mesh where each grid of the mesh is assigned the mean value of all wells within it the phase information in the grace and water level time series is most of interest in this study the phase shift associated with spatial smoothing is generally less than 0 5 months 15 degree chen et al 2007 klees et al 2007 therefore the bias error and uncertainty mostly associated with amplitude in the grace data processing were not investigated processed estimates of tws anomalies from grace land mass grids swenson and wahr 2006 landerer and swenson 2012 at 1 0 degree resolution were obtained from january 2004 to december 2010 data since 2011 is not used for spectral analysis due to gaps associated with battery aging the soil water storage sws is estimated by using the noah model simulation from nasa s global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 with 1 0 degree resolution the residuals of scaled grace subtracted by gldas grace gldas represent the gws anomalies in the ncp ignoring surface water storage as most previous studies the sws estimated by the gldas may have considerable uncertainties among several land surface models in the gldas such as noah vic clm2 etc however the objective of this study is not to obtain the exact phase or amount of gws derived from the grace glads but to investigate relative spatial difference in the phase characteristics therefore only noah model is used in this study and no further validation of gldas based sms was carried out 3 3 singular spectrum analysis of gws anomalies in this study the singular spectrum analysis ssa analysis was applied to decompose the gws and wl time series into the long term trend the periodic components and high frequency noise fig 6 trend and periodic components are generally extracted by least squares fitting of a trend term and harmonic terms with constant amplitude and phase jin and feng 2013 huang et al 2015 however these seasonal signals may have a time variable amplitude and phase moreover the first two order polynomial functions to represent the trend cannot effectively capture the nonlinear trend the ssa is a non parametric method which does not require a prior knowledge of the dynamics affecting the time series with benefits that trends obtained in this way are not necessarily linear and true oscillations can be amplitude and phase modulated the ssa mtm toolkit ghil et al 2002 was applied to the monthly data time series for extracting the trend term and the dominant periodic components singular spectrum analysis ssa is a modified form of principal component analysis pca in the vector space of delay coordinates for a time series ssa decomposes the raw hydrologic time series into temporal principal components pcs vautard et al 1992 ghil et al 2002 because the pcs do not contain the phase information of the time series oscillatory modes and noise are reconstructed by using linear combinations of the pcs and orthogonal functions eofs to create the reconstructed components rcs vautard et al 1992 ghil et al 2002 no information is lost during the reconstruction process because the sum of the individual rcs is equal to the original time series the gws and wl anomalies averaged across the ncp are firstly investigated fig 6 the first eight accounting for 90 of total variance reconstructed components rcs are the significant terms in the grace derived gws time series table 4 fig s2 the sum of the first two low frequency rcs rcs1 2 is the nonlinear trend component fig 6a the nonlinear trend of the gws represents the storage change related with climatic change and the effects of long term human activities e g long term groundwater overexploitation the sum of the annual cycle pair signals rcs3 4 can be explained by groundwater storage change caused by the seasonal pumping cycle fig 6b smaller amplitude of the annual periodic oscillation likely reflect smaller gws caused by reduced groundwater irrigation pumpage accompanied by water level recovery the rest of rcs are high frequency signals containing semi annual variations see fig s2 3 4 phase analysis of gws and groundwater level anomalies the non linear trend identified using the ssa analysis was subtracted from each time series and then harmonic analysis was then applied the annual and semi annual periodic components to determine the phase a modified sinusoidal model bell et al 2008 including annual and semi annual harmonic terms was used to fit each the de trend time series 3 δ h t a a 1 cos 2 π t 1 t π ϕ 1 180 a 2 cos 2 π t 2 t π ϕ 2 180 where δh t is the fitted time series t is time in unit of month a is a constant shift of the model due to noise a 1 t 1 ϕ 1 are amplitude period in unit of month and phase in unit of degree for the annual cycle harmonic terms a 2 t 2 ϕ 2 are for the semi annual periodic terms the periodic annual components of gws and shallow and deep wl time series have small phase shifts during the period of 2004 2007 fig 6b the periodic components for the period 2008 2010 were not well determined and a significant decrease was shown in the amplitude the observed aquifer system compaction and groundwater level time series also have shown phase shift at the subsiding area fig 6c the noticeable land subsidence rebound indicates that this phase shift is highly likely associated with the no delay compaction of the clay layers among the four primary land subsidence centers in the ncp fig 7 land rebound can only be observed in dezhou the skeletal specific storage vertical hydraulic conductivity and thickness of the aquitard determine its delay features the thickness of the quaternary aquifer system in the ncp is 300 500 m containing clay layers with thickness ranging from 0 to 300 m and greater than 50 m in the land subsidence region the reported hydraulic parameters of aquitard in the ncp are generally determined by stress strain diagram using borehole extensometer records and groundwater hydrographs from piezometers and by laboratory tests inverse modeling using regional insar monitored land subsidence and benchmark data or borehole extensometer data is widely used to estimate hydraulic parameters of aquitard however to the authors knowledge no studies have used inverse modeling to estimate aquitard parameters in the ncp the reported hydraulic parameters of aquitard in the ncp has been summarized in table 5 given the representative ranges of skeletal specific storage 10 5 10 3 1 m and hydraulic conductivity 10 7 10 5 m d table 5 of the clay interbeds most of 5 20 m thick in the ncp see fig s3 the time constant for clay interbeds in the ncp ranges in days nearly no delay to about three thousands of years the combined effects of delayed and no delay compaction and the wide range of time constant will complicate the phase relationship between gws and wl therefore the phase of gws and wl is further investigated at each grid point see fig s4 the phase difference obtained from gws minus deep wl phases shows notable local characteristics fig 8 the phase differences are 12 116 degrees for the annual periodic components and 1 170 degrees for the semi annual cycles if not considering leading or lagging fig 8 see fig s5 the primary irrigation season for winter wheat in the ncp is the spring irrigation that generally begins in mid march and stops in may the length of this primary pumping period suggests that a phase difference around 90 degrees 3 months might be reasonable the two grid points showing nearly in phase phase shift about 10 degrees in annual components of gws and wl are located in the coastal plain around tianjin and cangzhou fig 8b areas underlain by thick fine grained deposits guo et al 2015 land subsidence in tianjin has occurred earliest in the ncp since the 1920 s and the land subsidence rate has declined since the 1990 s due to regulations of groundwater pumping guo et al 2015 fig 7 the grid points around dezhou and hengshui show 270 degrees equivalent to 90 degrees ignoring leading or lagging phase shift between gws and wl fig 8b and greater amplitude in wl anomalies than tianjin and cangzhou see fig s6 possibly due to the relatively thinner clay thickness and its smaller compaction time constant these observations are also consistent with the numerical test cases in that larger phase shift could be found in the early stage of compaction of the aquifer system containing delayed confining layers huang et al 2015 used a single factor for each sub region in the ncp to correct the bias error and suggested that the time series would be more feasible for leakage error correction according to this way of thinking the spatially varied phase relationship between gws and wl due to aquifer heterogeneity and differences in and human activities must be valuable to improve the grace data processing and extend its applications 4 discussion and conclusions groundwater storage loss due to compaction of the confining layers is an unavoidable factor when using groundwater level observations to estimate gws and validate the grace derived gws in a subsiding area for both amplitude and phase signals although accurate land subsidence measurements can reasonably represent storage change in the confining layers the phase shift between wl and gws can be a common phenomenon in a subsiding aquifer and must be analyzed carefully considering the aquifer heterogeneity and stress history the varied amplitude of wl variations and phase relationship between gws and wl for the same gws changes series demonstrates that the grace estimates of terrestrial storage change cannot be validated solely by groundwater level observations in a subsiding area the phase relationship between gws and wl are related with the compaction characteristics of the confining layer and is time dependent stress strain analysis should be carried out to determine the stage of the compaction and aquifer system characteristics considering that fully integrating all the process related with infiltration and recharge mechanisms is still difficult in the grace analysis due to the difficulty to present the storage in the deep unsaturated zone huang et al 2012 and local hydrological effects e g mäkinen et al 2014 high resolution field based groundwater level monitoring is still necessary to evaluate and improve the grace based gws estimates hydrostratigraphy and groundwater flow modeling are necessary to present the transient response of the groundwater system to pumping and provide the most accurate prior information both in amplitude and phase reliable estimates of gws variations where multiple storage components are present like the ncp require strong integration of space and
