4910,semi distributed hydrological and water quality models are increasingly used as innovative and scientific based management tools however their application is usually restricted to the gauging stations where they are originally calibrated limiting their spatial capability in this study the semi distributed hydrological water quality model hype hydrological predictions for the environment was tested spatially to represent nitrate n no 3 n and total phosphorus tp concentrations and loads of the nested and heterogeneous selke catchment 463 km2 in central germany first an automatic calibration procedure and uncertainty analysis were conducted using the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream tool to simulate discharge no 3 n and tp concentrations a multi site and multi objective calibration approach was applied using three main gauging stations covering the most important hydro meteorological and physiographical characteristics of the whole catchment second the model s capability was tested to represent further internal stations which were not initially considered for calibration results showed that discharge was well represented by the model at all three main stations during both calibration 1994 1998 and validation 1999 2014 periods with lowest nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 71 and maximum percentage bias pbias of 18 0 the model was able to reproduce the seasonal dynamics of no 3 n and tp concentrations with low predictive uncertainty at the three main stations reflected by pbias values in the ranges from 16 1 to 6 4 and from 20 0 to 11 5 for no 3 n and tp load simulations respectively at internal stations the model could represent reasonably well the seasonal variation of nutrient concentrations with pbias values in the ranges from 9 0 to 14 2 for no 3 n and from 25 3 to 34 3 for tp concentration simulations overall results suggested that the spatial validation of a nutrient transport model can be better ensured when a multi site and multi objective calibration approach using archetypical gauging stations is implemented further results revealed that the delineation of sub catchments should put more focus on hydro meteorological conditions than on land use features keywords hype model nitrate n phosphorus internal validation uncertainty analysis archetypical gauging station 1 introduction high exports of nitrogen n and phosphorous p from agriculture are continuously threatening the aquatic ecosystem in surface waters and coastal areas throughout the world reusch et al 2018 river nutrient loads are highly impacted by agricultural practices and land use characteristics rode et al 2009 the main contribution of n loads in europe stems from agriculture while the dominant sources of p are wastewater and dwellings delgado and scalenghe 2008 whiters et al 2014 malagó et al 2019 the n to p ratio in the freshwater ecosystem is also much influenced by human activities on a global scale beusen et al 2016 hydrological transport has a strong impact on n exports which are mostly regulated by subsurface flow lam et al 2012 the high input of n through mineral fertilizer and manure application stimulates the rate of n processing in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems hall et al 2009 coastal algal blooms are also induced due to excess n inputs le moal et al 2019 and p contributions recent studies have suggested that the export of p from terrestrial to stream systems is limited by the occurrence of storm events that exacerbate soil erosion lee et al 2013 previous studies revealed a higher inter field variation of p influenced by soil characteristics and soil moisture conditions rather than by effects from the application of crop rotation fertilizers kistner et al 2013 haygarth et al 2014 catchment modeling has been widely used for hydrology sciences and environment related research studies under different objectives distributed and semi distributed process based catchment models offer an opportunity to improve the physical understanding of processes and to formalize the knowledge of catchment systems thereby gained and thus can be used as complex catchment management tools jackson blake et al 2016 such models can be used to identify and address data gaps to help in the design of monitoring strategies mcintyre and wheater 2004 jackson blake and starrfelt 2015 and testing and evaluation of environmental management strategies hashemi et al 2016 numerous catchment water quality models such as swat soil and water assessment tool inca integrated catchment hspf hydrological simulation program fortran and hbv hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning have been used in recent decades depending on researchers specific objectives wellen et al 2015 during the development and testing of the hype hydrological predictions for the environment model lindström et al 2010 made a comparison with the most commonly used hydrological and water quality models swat inca mike basin an integrated hydrological modeling system developed by the company dhi water and environment and moneris modeling nutrient emissions in river systems based on model complexity input data constraints ease of application time effectiveness and performance of the model the swat model needs an enormous amount of input data and neglects the entrance of groundwater into aquifers during hydrology related simulations chahinian et al 2011 glavan et al 2011 limiting its application without further adjustment wade et al 2002 have reported that the inca model is only focused on the river part of the aquatic system although some improvements have been incorporated in the latest version of the inca model regarding nutrient exports from terrestrial parts jackson blake et al 2016 this model is still overly complex for catchment studies jackson blake et al 2017 the mike basin model is a water resource management tool featuring advances in user interface linked to arcview gis but is limited regarding nutrient transformation descriptions kumar et al 2018 moneris describes nutrient pathways and is based on a regression investigation without a description of detailed processes and water balance behrendt et al 2002 with regard to water balance water compartments soil nutrient balance and dynamics the hype model justifies all these characteristics as a process based hydrological and water quality model lindström et al 2010 that achieves a balance between complexity and process representation refsgaard 2001 stated that for operational use conceptual models have major potential when compared to physically distributed models though the latter show potential for research purposes previous studies argued for the importance of gathering informative data from more than one location e g catchment outlet regarding spatial reference wellen et al 2015 moussa et al 2007 relying on observed data from a single location leads to the possibility of poorly simulated fluxes especially in heterogeneous catchments beven 2006 calibration only at the outlet resulted in an over optimistic evaluation of the model s capability to generate the dynamics at internal stations which includes the source provenance and land use consequences wellen et al 2015 jiang et al 2014 suggested calibrating the process based model at more than one station within the catchment using a multi site calibration approach to minimize uncertainties of predictions of water quality studies related to hbv models concluded with the same suggestions pettersson et al 2001 besides numerous studies have reported that a multi objective calibration approach improves the optimization of model parameters refines the internal processes and reduces the uncertainty in hydrological water quality modeling gupta et al 1999 lu et al 2014 van griensven et al 2006 compared to the traditionally used stepwise method generally speaking hydrological and water quality models are kept restricted to the gauging stations where they are calibrated mostly at the outlet and these are likely to fail to represent internal stations there are limited studies that have validated the model performance internally within sub catchments e g dunn et al 2013 wellen et al 2015 also found in their study evaluating catchment nutrient water quality models that only 19 of studies from their database conducted calibration at more than one station they therefore concluded that using data from more than one gauge station can lead to considerably improved identification of spatially distributed model parameters they also suggested practicing the use of data from multi sites for parameterization calibration and validation to overcome overconfident assessment of the models this additional internal validation of semi distributed models can also increase confidence in applying these models for management purposes as mentioned above the hype model was developed based on achieving an effective balance between data requirements and reasonable process representation the hype model parameters are based on physiographical characteristics such as land use and soil type of the catchment rather than sub catchment divisions this enhances the transferral of model parameters to non gauged catchments which means that hype is not overly dependent on resolution or on the scale of the model lindström et al 2010 when compared to other distributed physically based models that are sensitive to multi scale problems refsgaard 1997 in terms of water quality and hydrology the hype model has been shown to represent the measured discharge and nutrient concentrations reliably in distinct catchments that are subject to different climatic and anthropogenic conditions strömqvist et al 2012 jiang et al 2014 pechlivanidis and arheimer 2015 hundecha et al 2016 jomaa et al 2016 veinbergs et al 2017 however the model has not been tested widely at internal stations which were not used for model calibration thus the objective of this study was i to set up the hype model for no 3 n and tp concentration calculation in the heterogeneous selke catchment using multi site and multi objective calibration ii to test the capability of the model to represent the measured no 3 n and tp concentrations at eight internal gauging stations that were not considered for calibration and iii to analyse the predictive uncertainty of the model for no 3 n and tp concentrations to this end the hype model was set up for the selke catchment which was delineated according to its internal stations at the outlet of sub catchments the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream tool vrugt et al 2009 was used to calibrate the model and analyse the predictive uncertainty at three main gauging stations silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf for discharge and for no 3 n and tp concentrations after this the set of parameters obtained from the calibration process was further tested at eight internal gauge stations 2 methodology 2 1 study area the selke catchment 463 km2 is located in the lower range of the harz mountains in central germany the selke discharges at its station at hausneindorf into the river bode which continues into the river elbe until it reaches the north sea monitoring data have been available since 1993 at three gauging stations at the main stem of the selke stream silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf these three stations were used for the calibration of the hype model for discharge no 3 n and tp concentrations the elevation of the selke catchment varies from 53 to 605 m fig 1 land use of the upper part is mainly dominated by three types of forest broad leaved coniferous and mixed and in the lower parts most of the area is dominated by arable land fig 1 resulting in a 52 area of the catchment being covered by arable land and 35 by forest a decrease in forest share from upstream towards downstream can be observed with an increase in arable land use the mountain area is covered by cambisols brown soils whereas the lowland areas are dominated by chernozems black soils the annual mean precipitation in the mountain part is 792 mm y 1 it then decreases to 450 mm y 1 towards downstream in lowland areas resulting in an average of 660 mm y 1 precipitation for the whole selke catchment haberlandt et al 2008 compared to winter in summer there is more precipitation with a ratio of 1 35 between both periods 9 c of mean temperature is recorded with an average monthly high of 15 5 c in july and 1 8 c in january from the mountains upstream towards the downstream area of the selke catchment the temperature increases due to lower elevation prevailing crops are winter wheat triticale winter barley rye corn and rape in the fertile lowland area additionally sugar beets are planted application of fertilizer in the selke catchment range from 130 to 190 kgn ha 1 y 1 to 20 30 kgp ha 1 y 1 according to a survey of farmers the long term average discharge of the fourth order selke stream is 1 54 m3 s 1 1994 2014 is considered mean no 3 n and tp concentrations recorded at hausneindorf are 3 15 mgn l 1 and 0 190 mgp l 1 respectively there is temporal variation in streamflow caused by high flows during winter periods rainfall with additional snowmelt and low flows with infrequent high flows characterized by extreme rainfall events in summer within areas close to the selke catchment there were 16 precipitations and two climate stations the density of precipitation stations was higher in mountain areas relative to lowland areas the source and resolution of spatial and temporal data used in the model are presented in table 2 there is a variation from weeks to a month in sampling frequency for discharge no 3 n and tp concentration the time series data from 1994 to 1998 were used for calibration and from 1999 to 2014 for validation at three main stations in addition measured discharge data from 2001 to 2008 at sub catchment 2 schäfertal fig 1 were used for spatial validation of discharge at this station a summary of selke catchment characteristics is given in table 1 eight internal stations represented as outlets of sub catchments were used for the spatial validation of the hype model these internal stations are monitored by state agency for flood protection and water management of saxony anhalt lhw at biweekly to monthly time steps these were selected based on their locations and data availabilities regarding no 3 n and tp concentration observations stations 1 2 3 4 and 5 are located in the forest dominant part and stations 6 7 and 8 represent the downstream arable land part of the selke catchment fig 1 station 2 schäfertal represents an agriculture dominated headwater sub catchment station 6 is located at the outlet of a mixed agriculture and urban dominated sub catchment in the lowlands these internal stations table s1 supplementary material represent exports from all different land use characteristics for the whole selke catchment for the internal stations the duration of observed time series data varied between 1994 and 2014 depending on the station 2 2 hype model approach the hype model is a process based and semi distributed model that simulates discharge nutrient transport and transformation description of the model and governing equations are available in detail elsewhere e g lindström et al 2010 and here only a summary of the model is given for application of the hype model the whole catchment was delineated into sub catchments based on the digital elevation model dem each sub catchment was further divided into different combinations of land use and soil type units jointly called soil land use classes slcs and also commonly known as hydrological response units hrus water flow and concentration of nutrients for each sub catchment are accumulated as the area weighted sum of respective values from all slcs simulation of variables from every sub catchment is routed between sub catchments and then finally to the outlet of the catchment through flow connections lindström et al 2010 2 3 setup of model and calibration hype was set up for a period of 21 years 1994 2014 for the simulation of discharge and no 3 n and tp concentrations according to the split sample approach the model was calibrated in the period 1994 1998 and validated in the period 1999 2014 simulation from 1993 was excluded from the model evaluation because that year was used as a warming up period for the model for the study the catchment was divided into 19 soil types and ten land use classes in total the selke catchment was categorized into 117 soil land use classes slcs and divided into 11 sub catchments three main stations for model calibration and eight internal stations for model evaluation all mean daily discharge data were calculated from 15 min high frequency measurements during the calibration period 1994 1998 we used biweekly observed n and p concentration data daily data of precipitation and mean temperature for discharge simulation were taken from the nearby monitoring stations for the relevant sub catchments data relating to different agricultural practices main crops and sowing harvesting time were taken from previous data published for the selke catchment kistner et al 2013 and kept constant for the whole simulation period from 1993 to 2015 fertilizer application rates did not show significant changes since 1993 in the study area häußermann et al 2019 residue amounts from plants and animals and their dates of the application were defined on the basis of livestock types and previous model applications in the selke catchment jiang et al 2015 three point source input data sets were used from six sewage treatment plants in the selke catchment from 1994 to 2014 depending on their availability for calibration of the model a multi site and multi objective method was implemented using the dream tool for parameter optimization of both discharge and water quality parameters the dream tool was coupled with hype using matlab scripts discharge and water quality parameters were calibrated simultaneously multi objective at silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf at the same time multi site using 10 000 iterations the dream tool is based on the markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach developed by vrugt et al 2009 it runs multiple trajectories in parallel to explore targeted posterior distribution this works on the principle of self adaptive random sampling it is a globally used tool for the research and optimization for bayesian inference of the posterior probability density function of model parameters schoups and vrugt 2010 it has been successfully applied in various model calibration studies jiang et al 2015 decker et al 2012 the multi site approach was applied to account for the impact on hydrological and n processes by spatial inconsistencies in climate patterns land use topography and soil type hype model parameters are divided into three categories as a general parameters b land use dependent parameters and c soil dependent parameters jiang et al 2014 discharge and no 3 n related sensitive parameters were identified in jiang et al 2014 tp related sensitive parameters were taken from namugize et al 2017 and identified through manual calibration optimization of the sensitive parameters was done by using dream in this step the initial values of the parameters and the range of calibrated parameters were based on values taken from previous application of hype jiang et al 2014 namugize et al 2017 details of the parameters are given in table 3 two calibration schemes were used for this study scheme 1 calibration only at hausneindorf and scheme 2 calibration at hausneindorf meisdorf and silberhuette improved model performance was obtained by scheme 2 due to the application of a multi site and multi objective approach the detailed model performance results from scheme 2 are discussed in section 4 results from scheme 1 are given in section s2 supplementary material for gauge stations hausneindorf meisdorf and silberhuette as well as for internal stations 2 4 model performance criteria the capability of the model to predict discharge no 3 n and tp concentrations was evaluated statistical methods and graphical observations were used for the assessment of the model s performance for the evaluation of hydrological modeling the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse measure is widely used nse is dependent on factors like size of the samples magnitudinal bias outliers time offset of hydrograph models and intervals between hydrological sampling data jain and sudheer 2008 mccuen et al 2006 resulting in an incomplete evaluation of model performance thus two additional statistical criteria were considered in the analysis percentage bias pbias and mean values mean observed vs mean simulated a more detailed description of these criteria has been extensively covered in many previous studies e g gupta et al 1999 mccuen et al 2006 moriasi et al 2007 nash and sutcliffe 1970 ullrich and volk 2010 the above mentioned criteria were evaluated by the following formulas 1 nse 1 i 1 n y i sim y i obs i 1 n y i obs y obs 2 pbias i 1 n y i sim y i obs i 1 n y i obs where y i sim and y i obs are the ith simulated and observed values for the criteria being evaluated respectively y obs and y sim are the mean values of observed and simulated results for the whole duration respectively and n is the total number of observations 2 5 uncertainty approach dream was used for the uncertainty analysis of the hype model for discharge no 3 n and tp concentration simulations it has been used successfully in other studies for the uncertainty analysis of hydrological and water quality models jiang et al 2015 estimation and assessment both of parameters and total uncertainty were conducted by dream parameter uncertainty is related to the prediction uncertainty resulting from the interaction of parameters and the complexity of the model the total uncertainty is related to the prediction uncertainty resulting from the non unique parameters behavior and structure of the model in this study 95 confidence interval band of parameter and total uncertainty was obtained from 10 000 mcmc estimations while the total uncertainty range was generated with random errors normal distribution three different criteria were used for quantification of prediction uncertainty of the model for discharge no 3 n and tp concentration simulations assessment of 95 confidence interval sharpness was done by average relative interval length jin et al 2010 the percentage of observations embodied by the 95 predicted confidence intervals pci was used for reliability assessment percentage of observed concentrations connected by unit confidence interval puci was used to assess the credibility of 95 confidence intervals and was calculated on the basis of the average relative interval length aril and pci lu et al 2011 aril and puci were calculated according to eqs 3 and 4 3 aril 1 n limit upper t limit lower t q obs t 4 puci 1 0 abs pci 0 95 aril where limit upper t and limit lower t are upper and lower boundaries respectively n is the time interval and q obs t is the measured observation at tth time 3 results 3 1 calibration schemes validation pbias values at three main stations and at internal stations for these two schemes are shown in table 4 calibration using scheme 2 calibration using the three main stations shows better results at main stations as well as at internal stations than calibration using scheme 1 where only observation from the outlet of the selke was considered respective means of pbias values for no 3 n and tp concentrations were 20 2 and 3 0 table 4 at main stations and 5 1 and 20 9 table 4 at internal stations using calibration scheme 1 however all pbias values that were obtained in calibration scheme 2 showed better results than calibrated scheme 1 except for the pbias value of tp concentration the latter was lower at three main stations with a pbias value of 7 6 because tp concentration was mainly controlled by point source data which were not consistent for the whole validation period at all point source data locations due to better comparative results obtained by calibration scheme 2 at the main three stations as well as internal stations results from calibration scheme 2 were used for further discussion and conclusion 3 2 calibrated parameters the calibrated model parameters of discharge no 3 n and tp concentration are listed in table 3 with their physical interpretation initial values and range as well as their optimized values the most sensitive parameters jiang et al 2014 for discharge are wcep for brown soil which is the dominant soil type in mountain areas rivvel as a general parameter and cevp for the most dominant land use arable land and forest velocity of flow rivvel in the river is responsible for the presentation of the hydrograph epotdist and cevp are important as these control evapotranspiration from no 3 n related processes the uptsoil parameter for arable dominant land was more sensitive than other parameters and represents the share of uptake by plants from the first layer of soil parameter denitr is important and sensitive as it controls the denitrification rate of no 3 n among tp related parameters sedexp is the most sensitive and is responsible for the sedimentation factor the second most sensitive parameter for tp was pnratio which is responsible for the relationship between n and p for plant uptake it was observed that for discharge no 3 n and tp most of the calibrated parameters have optimized values close to the initial given values and not close to minimum and maximum limits all optimized values of calibrated parameters are given in table 3 3 3 discharge simulation discharge simulation results criteria table 5 showed that the model performance for both calibration 1994 1998 and validation 1999 2014 functioned reasonably well the hype model was able to capture the seasonal behavior for all three main gauging stations silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf for both calibration and validation periods and during low and high flow conditions fig s1 supplementary material during the calibration period the highest nse value 0 87 was recorded in the uppermost station silberhuette and the lowest nse value 0 84 at the outlet station hausneindorf the pbias of water balance for the calibrated period at all three main stations was between 4 8 and 2 1 which showed the best representation of discharge by the model during the validation period 1999 2014 the highest and lowest nse values of 0 76 at silberhuette and 0 71 at hausneindorf were observed the water balance was better represented by the model during the calibration period compared to the validation period during the validation period the water balance pbias values at silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf were 11 9 3 0 and 18 0 respectively overall discharge performance during both calibration and validation was very good and good respectively according to the evaluation criteria of moriasi et al 2007 3 4 nitrogen simulation the model performance results of no 3 n load simulations are presented in table 5 load simulations were well represented by the model during both calibration and validation periods the highest and lowest nse values of no 3 n loads were 0 93 and 0 70 during both calibration and validation periods during the calibration no 3 n load simulations were well represented by the model with the highest performance at silberhuette nse 0 93 pbias 2 1 and the lowest performance at hausneindorf nse 0 74 pbias 5 7 for the simulation of no 3 n the model covered both higher and lower values of observed no 3 n concentrations represented in fig 2 the model performance at silberhuette was better when compared to meisdorf due to the clear pattern of seasonal behavior the highest values of nse 0 64 and 0 49 for no 3 n concentrations were found at silberhuette during calibration and validation periods respectively table s3 1 nse values of 0 58 and 0 41 for no 3 n concentrations table s3 1 were attained at the meisdorf station during the calibration and validation period respectively pbias values for no 3 n concentrations were between 2 8 and 11 0 during both calibration and validation periods respectively table s3 1 which shows the satisfactory performance of the model at two upper stations the model performance was not as good at the outlet hausneindorf compared to the upper part of the selke catchment pbias 21 0 for no 3 n concentration mean simulated no 3 n concentration of 3 10 mgn l 1 was detected against the mean observed 3 18 mgn l 1 at hausneindorf station mean observed and mean simulated no 3 n concentrations at three main stations are given in the supplementary material table s3 2 3 5 phosphorous simulations model performance for tp loads is given in table 5 and tp simulated concentrations are presented in fig 3 for tp loads the best model performances were obtained at the upper two stations silberhuette and meisdorf during the calibration period nse values of 0 48 and 0 53 were achieved at silberhuette and meisdorf respectively however during the validation period silberhuette had a higher nse 0 52 compared to meisdorf 0 46 pbias values of tp loads for two upper stations were observed within a satisfactory range 20 0 to 11 5 for both calibration and validation periods table 5 tp measured concentration values for both upper gauging stations were predicted well for both the calibration and validation periods pbias values for tp concentration were 0 9 and 11 0 for silberhuette and 2 6 and 25 0 for meisdorf during calibration and validation respectively mean simulated and mean observed tp concentration values testify to the satisfactory performance of the model table s3 2 at hausneindorf the performance was affected by the combination of unknown point sources and farming activities in the agricultural downstream area of the selke catchment nse values for tp loads were 0 13 for calibration and 0 20 for validation the performance of the model was disturbed by the high observed concentration during low flow which was underestimated by the model fig 3 the pbias values for tp concentration during calibration and validation at hausneindorf were 6 6 and 13 0 respectively a mean simulated tp concentration of 0 190 mgp l 1 was recorded against 0 210 mgp l 1 mean observed concentration at hausneindorf station during the calibration period table s3 2 supplementary material 3 6 spatial validation of no 3 n and tp concentration at internal stations calibrated model parameters were further tested at internal stations that were not included in the calibration mode the calibrated discharge parameter set was used at the schäfertal headwater station 2 fig 1 for discharge simulation model validation resulted in nse 0 25 and pbias 20 0 for the period from 2001 to 2008 the mean simulated discharge was 7 5 l s 1 and the mean observed discharged was 10 0 l s 1 for the whole period observed and simulated no 3 n concentrations at five internal stations are shown in fig 4 and performance criteria are given in table 6 the temporal frequency of data was different for internal stations these nutrient concentrations were simulated by using the same single set of parameters that were obtained after the multi site calibration process at three main stations silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf fig 4 presents no 3 n concentration simulations of five sub catchments stations 1 2 4 8 and 10 for most of the stations a good agreement between simulated and observed no 3 n concentrations was found table 5 reflecting the capability of hype to represent no 3 n concentration at different land use dominated sub catchments the difference between mean simulated 9 47 mgn l 1 and mean observed concentration 8 46 mgn l 1 values was greater at station 8 fig 4d due to agriculture dominant land use in that particular sub catchment the model was able to represent well the no 3 n concentration of the agricultural headwater catchment 2 station 2 fig 4e with simulated and observed mean no3 n concentration of 4 35 mgn l 1 and 4 52 mgn l 1 respectively the model was able to accurately capture the no3 n concentration dynamics of forest dominated sub catchments stations 1 4 and 5 simulating a mean concentration of 1 67 mgn l 1 and 2 00 mgn l 1 for stations 1 and 4 fig 4a b respectively pbias values for these five sub catchments are given in table 5 with the highest performance at sub catchment 1 pbias 2 5 and the lowest at sub catchment 8 pbias 14 2 the model performance criteria of tp concentration are given in table 5 stations 3 4 5 6 and 7 and the simulated time series of five sub catchments are shown in fig 5 a good agreement of observed and simulated mean tp concentrations was obtained sub catchments of stations 3 4 and 5 stations at the main stem are forest dominated with some share of arable land and the measured tp concentrations were between 0 031 mgp l 1 and 0 051 mgp l 1 table 6 the largest difference between mean measured 0 051 mgp l 1 and simulated 0 036 mgp l 1 tp concentrations was observed at sub catchment 4 which is located downstream of a point source impacted reach the point source impacted sub catchment 6 headwater catchment showed a significant difference between its observed 0 200 mgp l 1 and simulated 0 300 mgp l 1 tp concentrations sub catchment 7 is located at the main stem in the agriculture part of the selke catchment and represents two different periods of tp concentration differences between mean observed and simulated tp concentrations were primarily caused by simulation errors in the first period of higher point source pollution the pbias values for all sub catchments range from 25 3 to 34 3 overall the model performance at the stations situated at the main stream is better than that located in the tributaries fig 1 and table 5 3 7 uncertainty analysis predicted uncertainty and total uncertainty 95 ranges of daily discharge no 3 n concentration and tp concentration are shown for the outlet of the selke catchment hausneindorf in fig 6 and the corresponding aril pci and puci of 95 predicted confidence intervals are listed in table 7 the band for parameter uncertainty black shaded area of discharge simulation is narrow indicating low uncertainty related to parameter optimization and showing a very similar variation to the observed values represented by red dots this is confirmed by the small value of aril 0 093 characterizing the narrow range black range of 95 confidence intervals the total uncertainty of discharge prediction was much higher than the parameter uncertainty and this is reflected by the high value of aril 4 139 and a large range of 95 confidence intervals grey band in fig 6 parameter and total uncertainty ranges for no 3 n concentration simulations are much wider which indicates higher uncertainty when compared to discharge simulations parameter related uncertainty ranges are much narrower than the total uncertainty indicating that the predicted uncertainty is mainly caused by the uncertainty of model structure error and measurement error this is confirmed by aril values of total uncertainty 1 242 and parameter uncertainty 0 150 many of the observed concentration values are contained in the total prediction confidence interval 92 a lower puci value of total uncertainty 0 783 was evidence of higher uncertainty in the predictions of no 3 n simulations compared to discharge simulations in comparison to uncertainty for no 3 n concentration simulation higher uncertainty was revealed for the simulation of tp concentrations with wider ranges of 95 parameter and the total uncertainty confidence intervals the pci value for total uncertainty of tp concentration simulations 96 1 was higher than the pci 92 0 of no 3 n concentration simulations a lower value of puci for tp concentration simulations showed that the main drivers of uncertainty stem from model structure and measurement errors a very similar result to the one obtained from discharge and no 3 n concentration simulations 4 discussion our findings indicate a strong impact of the selected calibration scheme on no 3 n and tp concentration evaluation at the catchment scale when three gauging stations that accurately reflected the catchment heterogeneity from upstream to downstream in the calibration mode were considered the hype model was highly effective at representing the measured discharge and nutrient concentrations at internal stations in other words good agreement between the measured and simulated no 3 n concentration was achieved only when three main stations for model calibration were considered instead of using only the data from the catchment outlet at gauging station hausneindorf interestingly this improvement was very similar for the main stations and those additional internal stations that often provide for more uniform land use and which hence showed much larger variation in no 3 n concentration when compared to the main stations this improvement can be explained by the significant hydrogeographical differences between the three sub catchments represented by the three main gauge stations the uppermost sub catchment represented by the gauge station silberhuette is the wettest one with an average long term discharge of 414 mm and mixed agricultural and forest land use the two downstream gauge stations represent much drier conditions with only 72 mm as an average long term discharge in the intermediate sub catchment between gauge stations silberhuette and meisdorf and 36 mm in the lowest sub catchment representing the area between gauge stations meisdorf and hausneindorf moreover these two lower sub catchments differ markedly in geology and land use calibrating the model only at the catchment outlet does not allow for indicating a representative no 3 n parameterization for these heterogeneous catchment conditions it is important to note that internal catchments representing single land use types like forest sub catchment 1 or arable land sub catchments 2 and 8 showed acceptable or good model validation results even though model calibration was carried out at gauge stations with mixed land use patterns this indicates that the consideration of meteorological and hydrogeological area properties seems to be of significantly greater importance for no 3 n model calibration than consideration of land use urban areas did not contribute significantly to no 3 n load and point source inputs were controlled by sewage systems as previous studies like those of jiang et al 2015 and rode et al 2016 have also found after increasing the calibration gauging stations for tp simulation from one calibration scheme 1 to three calibration scheme 2 the validation results improved considerably only for internal stations looking at the three main stations the pbias of the validation results even became slightly worse these small changes in model performance when shifting from calibration scheme 1 to calibration scheme 2 are likely caused by the variability of tp values at the three stations these were highest at the most downstream gauging station hausneindorf adding the other two upstream gauge stations to the calibration procedure will not drastically change the parameters because of the lower weight of these stations on the optimization process nevertheless including the two upstream stations allowed the model to also better consider very low tp concentrations in those sub catchments not impacted by point source inputs from sewage systems this is reflected in the markedly improved mean pbias of the internal stations the results show that in contrast to no 3 n concentrations tp concentrations are much more strongly affected by point sources even sub catchments with a share of nearly 92 of agricultural land use sub catchment 2 did not reveal considerably different concentration ranges than the mostly forested sub catchment 3 areas at least during low flow conditions this was well captured by the model the model performance for tp concentration simulations at internal stations was lower than for no 3 n concentration simulations a rise in tp concentration from upstream to downstream can be explained by an increased share of urban and arable land use the hype model showed an underestimation of tp concentration in the forest dominated sub catchments 3 and 4 fig 5a and b because of an underestimation of some high flow events since the main export of tp occurs as a result of overland flow jiang and rode 2012 higher tp concentrations were found at sub catchments 6 and 7 fig 5d and e as these stations provide coverage over a higher share of urban and arable land tp concentrations in these sub catchments 6 and 7 were 2 5 times higher than in sub catchments 3 and 4 which may be explained by agricultural sediment and urban soluble p inputs lee et al 2013 the hype model overestimates tp concentration in sub catchments 6 and 7 which was possibly caused by uncertainties in point source data simulated high flow tp concentrations were only sporadically captured because of mostly low frequency sampling which reveals considerable uncertainties in assessing the model s performance yin et al 2016 our findings suggest that only rough estimates for internal stations can be achieved when the calibration of the model is conducted exclusively at the catchment outlet model performance of internal catchment stations could be considerably improved if additional stations silberhuette and meisdorf representing the upper and middle forest parts of the selke catchment were included in the calibration of discharge no 3 n and tp parameters these findings are in line with results from the meta analysis of wellen et al 2015 they argued that calibrating a model only at the outlet may lead to an over optimistic model evaluation for capturing internal catchment process dynamics 4 1 importance of input data the availability of accurate input data has an impact from the very beginning of a study and this can help to improve a model s performance in the validation period the number of precipitation stations decreased by almost half this was the main reason for the lower performance of the model at three main stations for the validation period precipitation and discharge data were established from 2001 to 2008 for station 2 which is a 1 45 km2 agriculture catchment in the beginning interpolated precipitation data were used for this station and the mean annual precipitation used for this station was 605 mm which led to a large underestimation of discharge with a pbias value of 45 0 later station specific precipitation data from here were used from 2001 to 2008 which leads to mean annual precipitation of 677 mm by using accurate precipitation data for this station the hype model showed much better performance for discharge without calibration at this station with a pbias value of 20 0 and nse of 0 25 this improved discharge results in much more accurate no 3 n concentration simulations at this sub catchment 4 2 uncertainty analysis regarding uncertainties surrounding our study more than 98 3 of discharge 92 0 of no 3 n and 96 1 of tp concentration observations were included in the range of 95 predicted confidence intervals pci the total prediction uncertainty was less influenced by parameter uncertainty with a high value of puci than from other uncertainty sources like structural and measurement uncertainties this reflects the sensible parameterization of discharge and water quality parameters these results are in line with former studies that also used bayesian uncertainty analysis e g yang et al 2007 jiang et al 2019 total uncertainty increased from discharge to no 3 n and tp concentrations prediction uncertainty relating to water quality simulations can be improved by using high frequency observation data during calibration jackson blake and starrfelt 2015 jiang et al 2019 the higher total uncertainty of tp simulations can be explained by the daily simulation time step resulting in higher short term variability of tp concentrations the lack of available event data and uncertainties in point source tp concentration data dean et al 2009 uncertainty analysis of water quantity as well as for water quality simulation showed the acceptable and justifiable performance of model assessment 5 conclusions our spatial validation of the hype model suggests that consistent spatially distributed results can be achieved only when enough observations from representative sub catchments of the hydrological characteristics of the whole catchment are considered in the calibration mode this is true for no 3 n simulations and is even more important for tp concentrations for the latter uncertainties of simulated concentrations are higher than for no 3 n and for discharge our findings suggest that hydro meteorological catchment characteristics are more crucial than the land use patterns consideration for delineating uniform sub catchments that allow for a reasonable no 3 n simulation within these subunits this has key implications for the choice of calibration gauge stations within a given larger catchment we assume that in mesoscale catchments it will mostly not be sufficient to choose only one station at the outlet of the catchment to calibrate the model if reasonable spatial simulations are also needed within the whole catchment due to low agricultural tp losses during high flow events catchment point sources clearly dominated tp loss in our study giving us reasonable proof of the model with sparse but long term data if agricultural tp losses are higher acceptable distributed model testing is only possible if more high frequency data are available to capture tp losses during high flow events in more detail likely these findings are also valid for other distributed nutrient transport models as well as the hype model selected for this study bearing these requirements in mind it is possible to support the development and evaluation of nutrient management and mitigation strategies using semi distributed hydrological nutrient models

4910,semi distributed hydrological and water quality models are increasingly used as innovative and scientific based management tools however their application is usually restricted to the gauging stations where they are originally calibrated limiting their spatial capability in this study the semi distributed hydrological water quality model hype hydrological predictions for the environment was tested spatially to represent nitrate n no 3 n and total phosphorus tp concentrations and loads of the nested and heterogeneous selke catchment 463 km2 in central germany first an automatic calibration procedure and uncertainty analysis were conducted using the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream tool to simulate discharge no 3 n and tp concentrations a multi site and multi objective calibration approach was applied using three main gauging stations covering the most important hydro meteorological and physiographical characteristics of the whole catchment second the model s capability was tested to represent further internal stations which were not initially considered for calibration results showed that discharge was well represented by the model at all three main stations during both calibration 1994 1998 and validation 1999 2014 periods with lowest nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 71 and maximum percentage bias pbias of 18 0 the model was able to reproduce the seasonal dynamics of no 3 n and tp concentrations with low predictive uncertainty at the three main stations reflected by pbias values in the ranges from 16 1 to 6 4 and from 20 0 to 11 5 for no 3 n and tp load simulations respectively at internal stations the model could represent reasonably well the seasonal variation of nutrient concentrations with pbias values in the ranges from 9 0 to 14 2 for no 3 n and from 25 3 to 34 3 for tp concentration simulations overall results suggested that the spatial validation of a nutrient transport model can be better ensured when a multi site and multi objective calibration approach using archetypical gauging stations is implemented further results revealed that the delineation of sub catchments should put more focus on hydro meteorological conditions than on land use features keywords hype model nitrate n phosphorus internal validation uncertainty analysis archetypical gauging station 1 introduction high exports of nitrogen n and phosphorous p from agriculture are continuously threatening the aquatic ecosystem in surface waters and coastal areas throughout the world reusch et al 2018 river nutrient loads are highly impacted by agricultural practices and land use characteristics rode et al 2009 the main contribution of n loads in europe stems from agriculture while the dominant sources of p are wastewater and dwellings delgado and scalenghe 2008 whiters et al 2014 malagó et al 2019 the n to p ratio in the freshwater ecosystem is also much influenced by human activities on a global scale beusen et al 2016 hydrological transport has a strong impact on n exports which are mostly regulated by subsurface flow lam et al 2012 the high input of n through mineral fertilizer and manure application stimulates the rate of n processing in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems hall et al 2009 coastal algal blooms are also induced due to excess n inputs le moal et al 2019 and p contributions recent studies have suggested that the export of p from terrestrial to stream systems is limited by the occurrence of storm events that exacerbate soil erosion lee et al 2013 previous studies revealed a higher inter field variation of p influenced by soil characteristics and soil moisture conditions rather than by effects from the application of crop rotation fertilizers kistner et al 2013 haygarth et al 2014 catchment modeling has been widely used for hydrology sciences and environment related research studies under different objectives distributed and semi distributed process based catchment models offer an opportunity to improve the physical understanding of processes and to formalize the knowledge of catchment systems thereby gained and thus can be used as complex catchment management tools jackson blake et al 2016 such models can be used to identify and address data gaps to help in the design of monitoring strategies mcintyre and wheater 2004 jackson blake and starrfelt 2015 and testing and evaluation of environmental management strategies hashemi et al 2016 numerous catchment water quality models such as swat soil and water assessment tool inca integrated catchment hspf hydrological simulation program fortran and hbv hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning have been used in recent decades depending on researchers specific objectives wellen et al 2015 during the development and testing of the hype hydrological predictions for the environment model lindström et al 2010 made a comparison with the most commonly used hydrological and water quality models swat inca mike basin an integrated hydrological modeling system developed by the company dhi water and environment and moneris modeling nutrient emissions in river systems based on model complexity input data constraints ease of application time effectiveness and performance of the model the swat model needs an enormous amount of input data and neglects the entrance of groundwater into aquifers during hydrology related simulations chahinian et al 2011 glavan et al 2011 limiting its application without further adjustment wade et al 2002 have reported that the inca model is only focused on the river part of the aquatic system although some improvements have been incorporated in the latest version of the inca model regarding nutrient exports from terrestrial parts jackson blake et al 2016 this model is still overly complex for catchment studies jackson blake et al 2017 the mike basin model is a water resource management tool featuring advances in user interface linked to arcview gis but is limited regarding nutrient transformation descriptions kumar et al 2018 moneris describes nutrient pathways and is based on a regression investigation without a description of detailed processes and water balance behrendt et al 2002 with regard to water balance water compartments soil nutrient balance and dynamics the hype model justifies all these characteristics as a process based hydrological and water quality model lindström et al 2010 that achieves a balance between complexity and process representation refsgaard 2001 stated that for operational use conceptual models have major potential when compared to physically distributed models though the latter show potential for research purposes previous studies argued for the importance of gathering informative data from more than one location e g catchment outlet regarding spatial reference wellen et al 2015 moussa et al 2007 relying on observed data from a single location leads to the possibility of poorly simulated fluxes especially in heterogeneous catchments beven 2006 calibration only at the outlet resulted in an over optimistic evaluation of the model s capability to generate the dynamics at internal stations which includes the source provenance and land use consequences wellen et al 2015 jiang et al 2014 suggested calibrating the process based model at more than one station within the catchment using a multi site calibration approach to minimize uncertainties of predictions of water quality studies related to hbv models concluded with the same suggestions pettersson et al 2001 besides numerous studies have reported that a multi objective calibration approach improves the optimization of model parameters refines the internal processes and reduces the uncertainty in hydrological water quality modeling gupta et al 1999 lu et al 2014 van griensven et al 2006 compared to the traditionally used stepwise method generally speaking hydrological and water quality models are kept restricted to the gauging stations where they are calibrated mostly at the outlet and these are likely to fail to represent internal stations there are limited studies that have validated the model performance internally within sub catchments e g dunn et al 2013 wellen et al 2015 also found in their study evaluating catchment nutrient water quality models that only 19 of studies from their database conducted calibration at more than one station they therefore concluded that using data from more than one gauge station can lead to considerably improved identification of spatially distributed model parameters they also suggested practicing the use of data from multi sites for parameterization calibration and validation to overcome overconfident assessment of the models this additional internal validation of semi distributed models can also increase confidence in applying these models for management purposes as mentioned above the hype model was developed based on achieving an effective balance between data requirements and reasonable process representation the hype model parameters are based on physiographical characteristics such as land use and soil type of the catchment rather than sub catchment divisions this enhances the transferral of model parameters to non gauged catchments which means that hype is not overly dependent on resolution or on the scale of the model lindström et al 2010 when compared to other distributed physically based models that are sensitive to multi scale problems refsgaard 1997 in terms of water quality and hydrology the hype model has been shown to represent the measured discharge and nutrient concentrations reliably in distinct catchments that are subject to different climatic and anthropogenic conditions strömqvist et al 2012 jiang et al 2014 pechlivanidis and arheimer 2015 hundecha et al 2016 jomaa et al 2016 veinbergs et al 2017 however the model has not been tested widely at internal stations which were not used for model calibration thus the objective of this study was i to set up the hype model for no 3 n and tp concentration calculation in the heterogeneous selke catchment using multi site and multi objective calibration ii to test the capability of the model to represent the measured no 3 n and tp concentrations at eight internal gauging stations that were not considered for calibration and iii to analyse the predictive uncertainty of the model for no 3 n and tp concentrations to this end the hype model was set up for the selke catchment which was delineated according to its internal stations at the outlet of sub catchments the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream tool vrugt et al 2009 was used to calibrate the model and analyse the predictive uncertainty at three main gauging stations silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf for discharge and for no 3 n and tp concentrations after this the set of parameters obtained from the calibration process was further tested at eight internal gauge stations 2 methodology 2 1 study area the selke catchment 463 km2 is located in the lower range of the harz mountains in central germany the selke discharges at its station at hausneindorf into the river bode which continues into the river elbe until it reaches the north sea monitoring data have been available since 1993 at three gauging stations at the main stem of the selke stream silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf these three stations were used for the calibration of the hype model for discharge no 3 n and tp concentrations the elevation of the selke catchment varies from 53 to 605 m fig 1 land use of the upper part is mainly dominated by three types of forest broad leaved coniferous and mixed and in the lower parts most of the area is dominated by arable land fig 1 resulting in a 52 area of the catchment being covered by arable land and 35 by forest a decrease in forest share from upstream towards downstream can be observed with an increase in arable land use the mountain area is covered by cambisols brown soils whereas the lowland areas are dominated by chernozems black soils the annual mean precipitation in the mountain part is 792 mm y 1 it then decreases to 450 mm y 1 towards downstream in lowland areas resulting in an average of 660 mm y 1 precipitation for the whole selke catchment haberlandt et al 2008 compared to winter in summer there is more precipitation with a ratio of 1 35 between both periods 9 c of mean temperature is recorded with an average monthly high of 15 5 c in july and 1 8 c in january from the mountains upstream towards the downstream area of the selke catchment the temperature increases due to lower elevation prevailing crops are winter wheat triticale winter barley rye corn and rape in the fertile lowland area additionally sugar beets are planted application of fertilizer in the selke catchment range from 130 to 190 kgn ha 1 y 1 to 20 30 kgp ha 1 y 1 according to a survey of farmers the long term average discharge of the fourth order selke stream is 1 54 m3 s 1 1994 2014 is considered mean no 3 n and tp concentrations recorded at hausneindorf are 3 15 mgn l 1 and 0 190 mgp l 1 respectively there is temporal variation in streamflow caused by high flows during winter periods rainfall with additional snowmelt and low flows with infrequent high flows characterized by extreme rainfall events in summer within areas close to the selke catchment there were 16 precipitations and two climate stations the density of precipitation stations was higher in mountain areas relative to lowland areas the source and resolution of spatial and temporal data used in the model are presented in table 2 there is a variation from weeks to a month in sampling frequency for discharge no 3 n and tp concentration the time series data from 1994 to 1998 were used for calibration and from 1999 to 2014 for validation at three main stations in addition measured discharge data from 2001 to 2008 at sub catchment 2 schäfertal fig 1 were used for spatial validation of discharge at this station a summary of selke catchment characteristics is given in table 1 eight internal stations represented as outlets of sub catchments were used for the spatial validation of the hype model these internal stations are monitored by state agency for flood protection and water management of saxony anhalt lhw at biweekly to monthly time steps these were selected based on their locations and data availabilities regarding no 3 n and tp concentration observations stations 1 2 3 4 and 5 are located in the forest dominant part and stations 6 7 and 8 represent the downstream arable land part of the selke catchment fig 1 station 2 schäfertal represents an agriculture dominated headwater sub catchment station 6 is located at the outlet of a mixed agriculture and urban dominated sub catchment in the lowlands these internal stations table s1 supplementary material represent exports from all different land use characteristics for the whole selke catchment for the internal stations the duration of observed time series data varied between 1994 and 2014 depending on the station 2 2 hype model approach the hype model is a process based and semi distributed model that simulates discharge nutrient transport and transformation description of the model and governing equations are available in detail elsewhere e g lindström et al 2010 and here only a summary of the model is given for application of the hype model the whole catchment was delineated into sub catchments based on the digital elevation model dem each sub catchment was further divided into different combinations of land use and soil type units jointly called soil land use classes slcs and also commonly known as hydrological response units hrus water flow and concentration of nutrients for each sub catchment are accumulated as the area weighted sum of respective values from all slcs simulation of variables from every sub catchment is routed between sub catchments and then finally to the outlet of the catchment through flow connections lindström et al 2010 2 3 setup of model and calibration hype was set up for a period of 21 years 1994 2014 for the simulation of discharge and no 3 n and tp concentrations according to the split sample approach the model was calibrated in the period 1994 1998 and validated in the period 1999 2014 simulation from 1993 was excluded from the model evaluation because that year was used as a warming up period for the model for the study the catchment was divided into 19 soil types and ten land use classes in total the selke catchment was categorized into 117 soil land use classes slcs and divided into 11 sub catchments three main stations for model calibration and eight internal stations for model evaluation all mean daily discharge data were calculated from 15 min high frequency measurements during the calibration period 1994 1998 we used biweekly observed n and p concentration data daily data of precipitation and mean temperature for discharge simulation were taken from the nearby monitoring stations for the relevant sub catchments data relating to different agricultural practices main crops and sowing harvesting time were taken from previous data published for the selke catchment kistner et al 2013 and kept constant for the whole simulation period from 1993 to 2015 fertilizer application rates did not show significant changes since 1993 in the study area häußermann et al 2019 residue amounts from plants and animals and their dates of the application were defined on the basis of livestock types and previous model applications in the selke catchment jiang et al 2015 three point source input data sets were used from six sewage treatment plants in the selke catchment from 1994 to 2014 depending on their availability for calibration of the model a multi site and multi objective method was implemented using the dream tool for parameter optimization of both discharge and water quality parameters the dream tool was coupled with hype using matlab scripts discharge and water quality parameters were calibrated simultaneously multi objective at silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf at the same time multi site using 10 000 iterations the dream tool is based on the markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach developed by vrugt et al 2009 it runs multiple trajectories in parallel to explore targeted posterior distribution this works on the principle of self adaptive random sampling it is a globally used tool for the research and optimization for bayesian inference of the posterior probability density function of model parameters schoups and vrugt 2010 it has been successfully applied in various model calibration studies jiang et al 2015 decker et al 2012 the multi site approach was applied to account for the impact on hydrological and n processes by spatial inconsistencies in climate patterns land use topography and soil type hype model parameters are divided into three categories as a general parameters b land use dependent parameters and c soil dependent parameters jiang et al 2014 discharge and no 3 n related sensitive parameters were identified in jiang et al 2014 tp related sensitive parameters were taken from namugize et al 2017 and identified through manual calibration optimization of the sensitive parameters was done by using dream in this step the initial values of the parameters and the range of calibrated parameters were based on values taken from previous application of hype jiang et al 2014 namugize et al 2017 details of the parameters are given in table 3 two calibration schemes were used for this study scheme 1 calibration only at hausneindorf and scheme 2 calibration at hausneindorf meisdorf and silberhuette improved model performance was obtained by scheme 2 due to the application of a multi site and multi objective approach the detailed model performance results from scheme 2 are discussed in section 4 results from scheme 1 are given in section s2 supplementary material for gauge stations hausneindorf meisdorf and silberhuette as well as for internal stations 2 4 model performance criteria the capability of the model to predict discharge no 3 n and tp concentrations was evaluated statistical methods and graphical observations were used for the assessment of the model s performance for the evaluation of hydrological modeling the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse measure is widely used nse is dependent on factors like size of the samples magnitudinal bias outliers time offset of hydrograph models and intervals between hydrological sampling data jain and sudheer 2008 mccuen et al 2006 resulting in an incomplete evaluation of model performance thus two additional statistical criteria were considered in the analysis percentage bias pbias and mean values mean observed vs mean simulated a more detailed description of these criteria has been extensively covered in many previous studies e g gupta et al 1999 mccuen et al 2006 moriasi et al 2007 nash and sutcliffe 1970 ullrich and volk 2010 the above mentioned criteria were evaluated by the following formulas 1 nse 1 i 1 n y i sim y i obs i 1 n y i obs y obs 2 pbias i 1 n y i sim y i obs i 1 n y i obs where y i sim and y i obs are the ith simulated and observed values for the criteria being evaluated respectively y obs and y sim are the mean values of observed and simulated results for the whole duration respectively and n is the total number of observations 2 5 uncertainty approach dream was used for the uncertainty analysis of the hype model for discharge no 3 n and tp concentration simulations it has been used successfully in other studies for the uncertainty analysis of hydrological and water quality models jiang et al 2015 estimation and assessment both of parameters and total uncertainty were conducted by dream parameter uncertainty is related to the prediction uncertainty resulting from the interaction of parameters and the complexity of the model the total uncertainty is related to the prediction uncertainty resulting from the non unique parameters behavior and structure of the model in this study 95 confidence interval band of parameter and total uncertainty was obtained from 10 000 mcmc estimations while the total uncertainty range was generated with random errors normal distribution three different criteria were used for quantification of prediction uncertainty of the model for discharge no 3 n and tp concentration simulations assessment of 95 confidence interval sharpness was done by average relative interval length jin et al 2010 the percentage of observations embodied by the 95 predicted confidence intervals pci was used for reliability assessment percentage of observed concentrations connected by unit confidence interval puci was used to assess the credibility of 95 confidence intervals and was calculated on the basis of the average relative interval length aril and pci lu et al 2011 aril and puci were calculated according to eqs 3 and 4 3 aril 1 n limit upper t limit lower t q obs t 4 puci 1 0 abs pci 0 95 aril where limit upper t and limit lower t are upper and lower boundaries respectively n is the time interval and q obs t is the measured observation at tth time 3 results 3 1 calibration schemes validation pbias values at three main stations and at internal stations for these two schemes are shown in table 4 calibration using scheme 2 calibration using the three main stations shows better results at main stations as well as at internal stations than calibration using scheme 1 where only observation from the outlet of the selke was considered respective means of pbias values for no 3 n and tp concentrations were 20 2 and 3 0 table 4 at main stations and 5 1 and 20 9 table 4 at internal stations using calibration scheme 1 however all pbias values that were obtained in calibration scheme 2 showed better results than calibrated scheme 1 except for the pbias value of tp concentration the latter was lower at three main stations with a pbias value of 7 6 because tp concentration was mainly controlled by point source data which were not consistent for the whole validation period at all point source data locations due to better comparative results obtained by calibration scheme 2 at the main three stations as well as internal stations results from calibration scheme 2 were used for further discussion and conclusion 3 2 calibrated parameters the calibrated model parameters of discharge no 3 n and tp concentration are listed in table 3 with their physical interpretation initial values and range as well as their optimized values the most sensitive parameters jiang et al 2014 for discharge are wcep for brown soil which is the dominant soil type in mountain areas rivvel as a general parameter and cevp for the most dominant land use arable land and forest velocity of flow rivvel in the river is responsible for the presentation of the hydrograph epotdist and cevp are important as these control evapotranspiration from no 3 n related processes the uptsoil parameter for arable dominant land was more sensitive than other parameters and represents the share of uptake by plants from the first layer of soil parameter denitr is important and sensitive as it controls the denitrification rate of no 3 n among tp related parameters sedexp is the most sensitive and is responsible for the sedimentation factor the second most sensitive parameter for tp was pnratio which is responsible for the relationship between n and p for plant uptake it was observed that for discharge no 3 n and tp most of the calibrated parameters have optimized values close to the initial given values and not close to minimum and maximum limits all optimized values of calibrated parameters are given in table 3 3 3 discharge simulation discharge simulation results criteria table 5 showed that the model performance for both calibration 1994 1998 and validation 1999 2014 functioned reasonably well the hype model was able to capture the seasonal behavior for all three main gauging stations silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf for both calibration and validation periods and during low and high flow conditions fig s1 supplementary material during the calibration period the highest nse value 0 87 was recorded in the uppermost station silberhuette and the lowest nse value 0 84 at the outlet station hausneindorf the pbias of water balance for the calibrated period at all three main stations was between 4 8 and 2 1 which showed the best representation of discharge by the model during the validation period 1999 2014 the highest and lowest nse values of 0 76 at silberhuette and 0 71 at hausneindorf were observed the water balance was better represented by the model during the calibration period compared to the validation period during the validation period the water balance pbias values at silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf were 11 9 3 0 and 18 0 respectively overall discharge performance during both calibration and validation was very good and good respectively according to the evaluation criteria of moriasi et al 2007 3 4 nitrogen simulation the model performance results of no 3 n load simulations are presented in table 5 load simulations were well represented by the model during both calibration and validation periods the highest and lowest nse values of no 3 n loads were 0 93 and 0 70 during both calibration and validation periods during the calibration no 3 n load simulations were well represented by the model with the highest performance at silberhuette nse 0 93 pbias 2 1 and the lowest performance at hausneindorf nse 0 74 pbias 5 7 for the simulation of no 3 n the model covered both higher and lower values of observed no 3 n concentrations represented in fig 2 the model performance at silberhuette was better when compared to meisdorf due to the clear pattern of seasonal behavior the highest values of nse 0 64 and 0 49 for no 3 n concentrations were found at silberhuette during calibration and validation periods respectively table s3 1 nse values of 0 58 and 0 41 for no 3 n concentrations table s3 1 were attained at the meisdorf station during the calibration and validation period respectively pbias values for no 3 n concentrations were between 2 8 and 11 0 during both calibration and validation periods respectively table s3 1 which shows the satisfactory performance of the model at two upper stations the model performance was not as good at the outlet hausneindorf compared to the upper part of the selke catchment pbias 21 0 for no 3 n concentration mean simulated no 3 n concentration of 3 10 mgn l 1 was detected against the mean observed 3 18 mgn l 1 at hausneindorf station mean observed and mean simulated no 3 n concentrations at three main stations are given in the supplementary material table s3 2 3 5 phosphorous simulations model performance for tp loads is given in table 5 and tp simulated concentrations are presented in fig 3 for tp loads the best model performances were obtained at the upper two stations silberhuette and meisdorf during the calibration period nse values of 0 48 and 0 53 were achieved at silberhuette and meisdorf respectively however during the validation period silberhuette had a higher nse 0 52 compared to meisdorf 0 46 pbias values of tp loads for two upper stations were observed within a satisfactory range 20 0 to 11 5 for both calibration and validation periods table 5 tp measured concentration values for both upper gauging stations were predicted well for both the calibration and validation periods pbias values for tp concentration were 0 9 and 11 0 for silberhuette and 2 6 and 25 0 for meisdorf during calibration and validation respectively mean simulated and mean observed tp concentration values testify to the satisfactory performance of the model table s3 2 at hausneindorf the performance was affected by the combination of unknown point sources and farming activities in the agricultural downstream area of the selke catchment nse values for tp loads were 0 13 for calibration and 0 20 for validation the performance of the model was disturbed by the high observed concentration during low flow which was underestimated by the model fig 3 the pbias values for tp concentration during calibration and validation at hausneindorf were 6 6 and 13 0 respectively a mean simulated tp concentration of 0 190 mgp l 1 was recorded against 0 210 mgp l 1 mean observed concentration at hausneindorf station during the calibration period table s3 2 supplementary material 3 6 spatial validation of no 3 n and tp concentration at internal stations calibrated model parameters were further tested at internal stations that were not included in the calibration mode the calibrated discharge parameter set was used at the schäfertal headwater station 2 fig 1 for discharge simulation model validation resulted in nse 0 25 and pbias 20 0 for the period from 2001 to 2008 the mean simulated discharge was 7 5 l s 1 and the mean observed discharged was 10 0 l s 1 for the whole period observed and simulated no 3 n concentrations at five internal stations are shown in fig 4 and performance criteria are given in table 6 the temporal frequency of data was different for internal stations these nutrient concentrations were simulated by using the same single set of parameters that were obtained after the multi site calibration process at three main stations silberhuette meisdorf and hausneindorf fig 4 presents no 3 n concentration simulations of five sub catchments stations 1 2 4 8 and 10 for most of the stations a good agreement between simulated and observed no 3 n concentrations was found table 5 reflecting the capability of hype to represent no 3 n concentration at different land use dominated sub catchments the difference between mean simulated 9 47 mgn l 1 and mean observed concentration 8 46 mgn l 1 values was greater at station 8 fig 4d due to agriculture dominant land use in that particular sub catchment the model was able to represent well the no 3 n concentration of the agricultural headwater catchment 2 station 2 fig 4e with simulated and observed mean no3 n concentration of 4 35 mgn l 1 and 4 52 mgn l 1 respectively the model was able to accurately capture the no3 n concentration dynamics of forest dominated sub catchments stations 1 4 and 5 simulating a mean concentration of 1 67 mgn l 1 and 2 00 mgn l 1 for stations 1 and 4 fig 4a b respectively pbias values for these five sub catchments are given in table 5 with the highest performance at sub catchment 1 pbias 2 5 and the lowest at sub catchment 8 pbias 14 2 the model performance criteria of tp concentration are given in table 5 stations 3 4 5 6 and 7 and the simulated time series of five sub catchments are shown in fig 5 a good agreement of observed and simulated mean tp concentrations was obtained sub catchments of stations 3 4 and 5 stations at the main stem are forest dominated with some share of arable land and the measured tp concentrations were between 0 031 mgp l 1 and 0 051 mgp l 1 table 6 the largest difference between mean measured 0 051 mgp l 1 and simulated 0 036 mgp l 1 tp concentrations was observed at sub catchment 4 which is located downstream of a point source impacted reach the point source impacted sub catchment 6 headwater catchment showed a significant difference between its observed 0 200 mgp l 1 and simulated 0 300 mgp l 1 tp concentrations sub catchment 7 is located at the main stem in the agriculture part of the selke catchment and represents two different periods of tp concentration differences between mean observed and simulated tp concentrations were primarily caused by simulation errors in the first period of higher point source pollution the pbias values for all sub catchments range from 25 3 to 34 3 overall the model performance at the stations situated at the main stream is better than that located in the tributaries fig 1 and table 5 3 7 uncertainty analysis predicted uncertainty and total uncertainty 95 ranges of daily discharge no 3 n concentration and tp concentration are shown for the outlet of the selke catchment hausneindorf in fig 6 and the corresponding aril pci and puci of 95 predicted confidence intervals are listed in table 7 the band for parameter uncertainty black shaded area of discharge simulation is narrow indicating low uncertainty related to parameter optimization and showing a very similar variation to the observed values represented by red dots this is confirmed by the small value of aril 0 093 characterizing the narrow range black range of 95 confidence intervals the total uncertainty of discharge prediction was much higher than the parameter uncertainty and this is reflected by the high value of aril 4 139 and a large range of 95 confidence intervals grey band in fig 6 parameter and total uncertainty ranges for no 3 n concentration simulations are much wider which indicates higher uncertainty when compared to discharge simulations parameter related uncertainty ranges are much narrower than the total uncertainty indicating that the predicted uncertainty is mainly caused by the uncertainty of model structure error and measurement error this is confirmed by aril values of total uncertainty 1 242 and parameter uncertainty 0 150 many of the observed concentration values are contained in the total prediction confidence interval 92 a lower puci value of total uncertainty 0 783 was evidence of higher uncertainty in the predictions of no 3 n simulations compared to discharge simulations in comparison to uncertainty for no 3 n concentration simulation higher uncertainty was revealed for the simulation of tp concentrations with wider ranges of 95 parameter and the total uncertainty confidence intervals the pci value for total uncertainty of tp concentration simulations 96 1 was higher than the pci 92 0 of no 3 n concentration simulations a lower value of puci for tp concentration simulations showed that the main drivers of uncertainty stem from model structure and measurement errors a very similar result to the one obtained from discharge and no 3 n concentration simulations 4 discussion our findings indicate a strong impact of the selected calibration scheme on no 3 n and tp concentration evaluation at the catchment scale when three gauging stations that accurately reflected the catchment heterogeneity from upstream to downstream in the calibration mode were considered the hype model was highly effective at representing the measured discharge and nutrient concentrations at internal stations in other words good agreement between the measured and simulated no 3 n concentration was achieved only when three main stations for model calibration were considered instead of using only the data from the catchment outlet at gauging station hausneindorf interestingly this improvement was very similar for the main stations and those additional internal stations that often provide for more uniform land use and which hence showed much larger variation in no 3 n concentration when compared to the main stations this improvement can be explained by the significant hydrogeographical differences between the three sub catchments represented by the three main gauge stations the uppermost sub catchment represented by the gauge station silberhuette is the wettest one with an average long term discharge of 414 mm and mixed agricultural and forest land use the two downstream gauge stations represent much drier conditions with only 72 mm as an average long term discharge in the intermediate sub catchment between gauge stations silberhuette and meisdorf and 36 mm in the lowest sub catchment representing the area between gauge stations meisdorf and hausneindorf moreover these two lower sub catchments differ markedly in geology and land use calibrating the model only at the catchment outlet does not allow for indicating a representative no 3 n parameterization for these heterogeneous catchment conditions it is important to note that internal catchments representing single land use types like forest sub catchment 1 or arable land sub catchments 2 and 8 showed acceptable or good model validation results even though model calibration was carried out at gauge stations with mixed land use patterns this indicates that the consideration of meteorological and hydrogeological area properties seems to be of significantly greater importance for no 3 n model calibration than consideration of land use urban areas did not contribute significantly to no 3 n load and point source inputs were controlled by sewage systems as previous studies like those of jiang et al 2015 and rode et al 2016 have also found after increasing the calibration gauging stations for tp simulation from one calibration scheme 1 to three calibration scheme 2 the validation results improved considerably only for internal stations looking at the three main stations the pbias of the validation results even became slightly worse these small changes in model performance when shifting from calibration scheme 1 to calibration scheme 2 are likely caused by the variability of tp values at the three stations these were highest at the most downstream gauging station hausneindorf adding the other two upstream gauge stations to the calibration procedure will not drastically change the parameters because of the lower weight of these stations on the optimization process nevertheless including the two upstream stations allowed the model to also better consider very low tp concentrations in those sub catchments not impacted by point source inputs from sewage systems this is reflected in the markedly improved mean pbias of the internal stations the results show that in contrast to no 3 n concentrations tp concentrations are much more strongly affected by point sources even sub catchments with a share of nearly 92 of agricultural land use sub catchment 2 did not reveal considerably different concentration ranges than the mostly forested sub catchment 3 areas at least during low flow conditions this was well captured by the model the model performance for tp concentration simulations at internal stations was lower than for no 3 n concentration simulations a rise in tp concentration from upstream to downstream can be explained by an increased share of urban and arable land use the hype model showed an underestimation of tp concentration in the forest dominated sub catchments 3 and 4 fig 5a and b because of an underestimation of some high flow events since the main export of tp occurs as a result of overland flow jiang and rode 2012 higher tp concentrations were found at sub catchments 6 and 7 fig 5d and e as these stations provide coverage over a higher share of urban and arable land tp concentrations in these sub catchments 6 and 7 were 2 5 times higher than in sub catchments 3 and 4 which may be explained by agricultural sediment and urban soluble p inputs lee et al 2013 the hype model overestimates tp concentration in sub catchments 6 and 7 which was possibly caused by uncertainties in point source data simulated high flow tp concentrations were only sporadically captured because of mostly low frequency sampling which reveals considerable uncertainties in assessing the model s performance yin et al 2016 our findings suggest that only rough estimates for internal stations can be achieved when the calibration of the model is conducted exclusively at the catchment outlet model performance of internal catchment stations could be considerably improved if additional stations silberhuette and meisdorf representing the upper and middle forest parts of the selke catchment were included in the calibration of discharge no 3 n and tp parameters these findings are in line with results from the meta analysis of wellen et al 2015 they argued that calibrating a model only at the outlet may lead to an over optimistic model evaluation for capturing internal catchment process dynamics 4 1 importance of input data the availability of accurate input data has an impact from the very beginning of a study and this can help to improve a model s performance in the validation period the number of precipitation stations decreased by almost half this was the main reason for the lower performance of the model at three main stations for the validation period precipitation and discharge data were established from 2001 to 2008 for station 2 which is a 1 45 km2 agriculture catchment in the beginning interpolated precipitation data were used for this station and the mean annual precipitation used for this station was 605 mm which led to a large underestimation of discharge with a pbias value of 45 0 later station specific precipitation data from here were used from 2001 to 2008 which leads to mean annual precipitation of 677 mm by using accurate precipitation data for this station the hype model showed much better performance for discharge without calibration at this station with a pbias value of 20 0 and nse of 0 25 this improved discharge results in much more accurate no 3 n concentration simulations at this sub catchment 4 2 uncertainty analysis regarding uncertainties surrounding our study more than 98 3 of discharge 92 0 of no 3 n and 96 1 of tp concentration observations were included in the range of 95 predicted confidence intervals pci the total prediction uncertainty was less influenced by parameter uncertainty with a high value of puci than from other uncertainty sources like structural and measurement uncertainties this reflects the sensible parameterization of discharge and water quality parameters these results are in line with former studies that also used bayesian uncertainty analysis e g yang et al 2007 jiang et al 2019 total uncertainty increased from discharge to no 3 n and tp concentrations prediction uncertainty relating to water quality simulations can be improved by using high frequency observation data during calibration jackson blake and starrfelt 2015 jiang et al 2019 the higher total uncertainty of tp simulations can be explained by the daily simulation time step resulting in higher short term variability of tp concentrations the lack of available event data and uncertainties in point source tp concentration data dean et al 2009 uncertainty analysis of water quantity as well as for water quality simulation showed the acceptable and justifiable performance of model assessment 5 conclusions our spatial validation of the hype model suggests that consistent spatially distributed results can be achieved only when enough observations from representative sub catchments of the hydrological characteristics of the whole catchment are considered in the calibration mode this is true for no 3 n simulations and is even more important for tp concentrations for the latter uncertainties of simulated concentrations are higher than for no 3 n and for discharge our findings suggest that hydro meteorological catchment characteristics are more crucial than the land use patterns consideration for delineating uniform sub catchments that allow for a reasonable no 3 n simulation within these subunits this has key implications for the choice of calibration gauge stations within a given larger catchment we assume that in mesoscale catchments it will mostly not be sufficient to choose only one station at the outlet of the catchment to calibrate the model if reasonable spatial simulations are also needed within the whole catchment due to low agricultural tp losses during high flow events catchment point sources clearly dominated tp loss in our study giving us reasonable proof of the model with sparse but long term data if agricultural tp losses are higher acceptable distributed model testing is only possible if more high frequency data are available to capture tp losses during high flow events in more detail likely these findings are also valid for other distributed nutrient transport models as well as the hype model selected for this study bearing these requirements in mind it is possible to support the development and evaluation of nutrient management and mitigation strategies using semi distributed hydrological nutrient models

4911,global precipitation estimation depends on constellations of mainly passive microwave sensors along with satellite radars and constellations of geosynchronous earth orbit infrared sensors with passive microwave constellations a persisting challenge is the limited sampling which impacts applications such as hydrological modeling this study presents a framework to examine the impact of the global precipitation measurement gpm orbital sampling on streamflow simulations orbital data from the gpm dual precipitation radar dpr 2a ku is used within the variable infiltration capacity vic model to derive ensembles of runoff simulations ensembles of synthetic precipitation fields are generated at different sampling intervals which are representative of gpm orbital data products with the

satellite based gridded rainfall product is considered as the reference rainfall for our study sampling uncertainty in orbital precipitation data is shown to amplify in streamflow simulations the statistical analysis indicates that increasing sampling rates tend to generate more realistic land surface fluxes the results from our study indicate that streamflow simulations from vic model using precipitation forcing at 6 hourly integration outperforms the simulations as compared to 3 hourly and 12 hourly forcing integration times this is exemplified by the statistical indices with mean relative error of 0 17 for simulations with 3 hourly forcing 0 12 for simulation with 6 hourly forcing and 0 57 for 12 hourly forcing the relative root mean square error rmse for 3 hourly 6 hourly 12 hourly for 2015 are 0 31 0 25 1 43 and for 2016 are 0 25 0 15 1 06 respectively it can be noticed that both mean relative error and relative rmse show a similar pattern for both years a generic framework is therefore proposed to study the manifestation of satellite constellation sampling uncertainty in hydrologic simulations which are crucial for future missions such as the cubesat based temporal experiment for storms and tropical systems and the time resolved observations of precipitation structure and storm intensity with a constellation of smallsats keywords gpm srem2d orbital data sampling uncertainty precipitation 1 introduction precipitation estimates from space borne constellations are quintessential for studies pertaining to global water and energy cycles skofronick jackson et al 2017 and it remains one of the key inputs for all model based hydrologic studies involving climatic extremes of flood and drought monitoring adegoke and carleton 2002 bolten et al 2010 water

even though modern satellite constellations of conically scanning microwave sensors redefine precipitation measurement scale our ability to collect satellite data far out spaces and sensibly assimilate it let alone understand it recent constellations have supported the next class of earth and space science missions and tailor measurement characteristics for evolving scientific understanding till date satellite constellations addressing earth s coverage have focused on circular orbits lüders 1961 gobetz 1963 easton and brescia 1969 walker 1970 1982 ballard 1980 jorgensen 1980 before year 1965 low earth orbits were only thought of owing to incapability of boosters for placing satellites into geostationary orbits lüders 1961 gobetz 1963 constellations with elliptical orbits have also been considered for missions requiring coverage of northern hemisphere draim 1985 singh et al 2020 found that a four satellite constellation with 24 hour sampling interval requires 60 less vehicle mass budget propellent and maintenance cost than a 48 hour sampling interval over a satellite lifetime the need for global satellite services dictates that satellite constellations should provide a global coverage but the specific question remains what decides the minimum number of satellites required to ensure optimum sampling for hydroclimatology the rapidly growing records of microwave based precipitation data made available from constellations have instigated a pressing need towards evaluating the associated uncertainty which arise from different sources such as retrieval error spatial temporal sampling error and sensor dependent error pertaining to microwave remote sensing most of the studies in literature focus on gridded data products fewer studies exist on evaluating the uncertainty inherent in orbital data products evaluations of the latter are essential as they potentially cause large uncertainties during real time flood forecasting studies especially at the watershed scale moreover a realistic representation of sampling considerations becomes more evident while analysing orbital data sensitivity analyses focusing on the impact of precipitation

satellite precipitation estimates tend to interact nonlinearly with the hydrologic modelling uncertainty components hossain and anagnostou 2005 indu and nagesh kumar 2015 hossain and anagnostou 2006a in particular sampling uncertainty is known to propagate through the hydrological models vergara et al 2013 a proper understanding of precipitation sampling uncertainty is key for their usage in hydrological and hydrodynamic models for runoff simulations hossain et al 2004 carried out a sensitivity analysis to understand the implication of satellite passive microwave pmw rainfall retrieval and sampling errors on flood prediction uncertainty they found that the uncertainty in flood prediction stemming from a 3 hour pmw sampling is comparable to the hourly sampling and increases to a factor of 2 3 times for a 6 hour sampling nijssen and lettenmaier 2004 quantified the effect of precipitation sampling errors on predictions of land surface fluxes anticipating the global precipitation measurement gpm satellites they found that the streamflow estimates were biased due to sampling errors the bias in the streamflow increases with the sampling interval and drainage area hong et al 2006 developed an uncertainty analysis framework based on monte carlo simulations to quantify error characteristics of satellite based precipitation and assess the influence of error propagation into hydrologic simulation they designed the precipitation estimation error as a fixed ratio of rain rates thereby improving the quantification of precipitation estimation error and uncertainty assessment of the error propagation into hydrologic simulation hossain and huffman 2008 developed a framework of error metrics for high resolution rainfall products that can advance their hydrologic application it was observed that working at finer space time scales for satellite rainfall estimation requires probabilistic measures that are mathematically amenable to space time stochastic simulation of satellite data aghakouchak et al 2009 developed a stochastic model for uncertainty analysis of satellite rainfall fields over north and south carolina the generated ensembles were compared with original satellite estimates with respect to statistical properties and spatial dependencies the results showed that the model can be used to describe the uncertainties associated with trmm multi satellite precipitation estimates nikolopoulos et al 2010 performed a data driven numerical experiment to understand the scale relationships of error propagation over complex terrains using a satellite rainfall error model the results showed that use of satellite rainfall for flood simulation depends strongly on the scale of application and satellite product resolution gebregiorgis et al 2012 investigated the effect of three independent bias components of satellite rainfall estimation hit bias missed and false precipitation on the uncertainty of runoff for a physically based hydrological model it was observed that there is high correlation of runoff error with hit bias indicating the need for improving the satellite rainfall products s ability to detect rainfall more consistently for flood prediction most of these studies evaluate synthetic gpm products or blended precipitation products they assume the gridded level3 products to display homogeneous uncertainty

das 2008 detailed error characterization of gridded satellite precipitation has shown that it is a complex manifestation of retrieval and sampling errors arising from multiple orbital products huffman et al 2007 joyce et al 2004 gebregiorgis et al 2018 the manifestation of sampling errors is due to infrequent revisits of low orbiting satellite platforms wilheit 1988 bell et al 1990 indu and nagesh kumar 2015 scheel et al 2011 ganesh et al 2019 the experimental setup of this study has been organized to address the crucial research question how does the intermittency caused by low sampling platforms propagate through a hydrological model and contribute to the streamflow uncertainty this study complements the existing literature by presenting a generic framework to analyse the sampling

located between 19 5 degrees and 24 degrees n latitudes and from 80 degrees to 84 degrees e longitudes fig 1 a it is a sub catchment of mahanadi river basin fig 1 b located in the eastern part of the indian subcontinent with an area of approx 85 200 km2 the mahanadi river basin is one of the major basins in the indian sub continent with an area of 141 600 km2 which covers major parts of odisha chhattisgarh small portions of madhya pradesh and jharkhand before flowing to the bay of bengal the hirakud catchment receives an annual rainfall of around 1600 mm the bulk of the precipitation falling in the period from july to september and it experiences a tropical monsoon type of climate beria et al 2017 this catchment is selected for the study owing to the frequent devastating floods crippling the economic development of the region therefore hydrological models are widely usedin this catchment for improving flood predictions the meteorology and climatology of the catchment are significantly influencedby the geographical location of the catchment with respect to the bay of bengal from where most of the weather systems originate in addition the orography of the eastern ghats influences the rainfall pattern over the catchment to a great extent as the study region is on the upstream of a major dam it is most suitable for implementing the vic model 3 model and data description 3 1 vic model the variable infiltration capacity vic model is used to simulate land surface states over the study area the vic model liang et al 1994 is a large scale physically based semi distributed macro scale hydrological model that represents the land surface in a grid based format it simulates the exchange of moisture and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere thereby solving the hydrologic fluxes in water and energy balance mode the vic model distinguishes itself from other models in terms of including multiple soil layers with variable infiltration multiple vegetation classes in a single grid cell and nonlinear baseflow along with these processes the model recreates land surface processes such as evapotranspiration gao et al 2009 soil moisture changes and runoff the grid cells of the vic model are modelled independently of each other with no horizontal flow across grids the soil properties of multiple subsurface soil layers are representedin terms of saturated hydraulic conductivity soil layer depth bulk density infiltration capacity and soil moisture diffusion parameter gao et al 2009 the variable infiltration curve zhao et al 1980 is used tocharacterizethe spatial heterogeneity of runoff generation for the generation of baseflow the model uses the arno model conceptualization franchini and paciani 1991 to generate runoff and baseflow at outputs of each grid cell a routing model developed by lohmann et al 1996 is used which assumes runoff to be linear and time invariant the routing model developed assures that water does not flow back from the channel to the grid to route streamflow the model utilizes the first differenced transfer function excess rainfall and unit hydrograph by a deconvolution iterative technique fdtf eruhdit by duband et al 1993 with a linearized saint venant equation that assumes the runoff transport process to be linear stable and time invariant the vic model has been used for different studies pertaining to land surface fluxes and states such as by maurer et al 2002 zhu and lettenmaier 2007 hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 wood et al 2002 wood et al 2005 wood and lettenmaier 2006 nijssen and lettenmaier 2004 pradhan and indu 2019 3 2 datasets 3 2 1 gpm precipitation product gpm core satellite jointly developed by japan and the united states carries two observation instruments namely the dual frequency precipitation radar dpr developed by japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa and the gpm microwave imager gmi developed by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the gpm mission combines multiple precipitation estimates fromindependent sensors the gpm core satellite has the ability to observe tropical regions and mid to high latitude areas with an orbit inclination of 65 degrees the dpr aboard the gpm core satellite is composed of two precipitation radars prs the ku pr operating at ku band 13 6 ghz and the ka pr at ka band 35 5 ghz hou et al 2014 the ku band radar is used to observe heavy rain whereas the ka band is sensitive to light rain and snow the dpr s swath width was about 245 km for the 13 6 ghz radar and about 125 km for the 35 5 ghz radar hou et al 2014 over the study period the gmi has 13 channels with a frequency range from 10 to 183 ghz with a swath width about 900 km hou et al 2014 the gpm data products are available in levels 1 2 and 3 as per the standard nomenclature the gpm mission was commenced with an objective to provide more accurate estimates of the rate of transfer of water from the atmosphere to the surface at local and global scales thereby reducing the source of uncertainty in the global water and energy budget for the present study the gpm level 2 orbital product from dpr 2a ku precipitation radar hereafter it is referred as dpr is used for the time periodof 2 years 2015 and 2016 3 2 2 cmorph precipitation products the noaa ncep climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph satellite based rainfall

delineation the soil data is from the food and agriculture fao world harmonized soil dataset hwsd the land use map was obtained from the decadal land use and land cover classifications across india with 14 land use land cover classes the daily discharge data at the inflow site of hirakud dam utilized for the vic model calibration and validation was obtained from the state water resources department burla sambalpur odisha hirakud dam project the meteorological forcing data i e temperature and wind speed were obtained from global land data assimilation system gldas vic model 4 methodology the key objective of this study is to find the optimum forcing integration time of orbital data product with narrow swath width that would minimize sampling uncertainty in the simulation of streamflow we structureda methodology using advanced hydrological and statistical models it should be noted that this methodology can be applied to any orbital data product to find its optimum temporal integration time for hydrological applications in this study we assess the optimum temporal integration time of the dpr for hydrological applications most studies have focussed primarily on sampling uncertainty that arises from the relatively infrequent intervals at which pmw sensors pass over any point two satellite rainfall algorithms with similar bias and root mean squared error rmse can have much different error propagation properties when used in hydrologic models lee and anagnostou 2004 to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first study towards the quantification of uncertainty in hydrological fluxes caused to sampling intermittency ofdpr orbital data a possible approach is to run hydrological simulations with precipitation forcing available only during the overpass times of satellite platforms this approach would make it challenging to disentangle the impact of orbital sampling from other error sources in the analysis framework because the intermittent precipitation forcing combines with other error sources associated with the hydrologic model structure and parameters to better isolate the satellite sampling error a background forcing is provided to the hydrologic model by a gridded product which provides continuous precipitation information in space and time the perturbation of the background by the orbital precipitation and the corresponding impact on the hydrologic model output enables to better isolate the satellite sampling error the representativeness of precipitation sampling evolves with spatial and temporal accumulation lebel et al 1987 while satellite sampled aggregated rainfall averages in space and time include error due to observation intermittence it is assumed that an optimal time aggregation can be identified in this framework in order to overcome the low sampling frequency of dpr we utilize the srem2d model to simulate dpr uniformly throughout the study area our intention is not to estimate the error of dpr orbital precipitation data but rather to understand the implication of likely dpr sampling errors for the simulation of hydrological fluxes and states in this study we estimate sampling errors of space time rainfall averages sampled by the gpm constellation satellites by aggregating them over a space scale of 0 25 degree and time scales of 3 6 and 12 h our key objective is to evaluate the effect of sampling using these aggregated rainfall data on streamflow simulation when forced into a grid based hydrologic model vic therefore to address this issue in our methodology we have used the srem2d model which corrupts the reference data with the error characteristics of dpr which includes the sampling error the main aim of the srem2d model in our methodology is to generate ensembles of aggregated precipitation forcing at intervals of 3hrs 6hrs and 12hrs representing the sampling intervals of dpr orbital product the overall flowchart of the methodology is presented in fig 2 which includes three sub sections the first section involves gridding of the dpr orbital data the second section describes the formulation of the satellite rainfall error model used to simulate synthetic dpr rainfall retrievals by corrupting the reference rainfall with the sampling error characteristics of dpr orbital data this step ensures that the synthetic dpr precipitation retrievals have the same sampling characteristics as that of dpr data in the present study the cmorph satellite based precipitation product joyce et al 2004 is consideredas the reference rainfall due to its availability at high spatial and temporal resolution 3 hourly in the present study the srem2d precipitation error model is used to simulate ensembles of synthetic precipitation fields see appendix a for details the srem2d is calibratedfor its error metrics parameters the parameters are 1 the probability of rain detection as a function of the reference precipitation 2 the probability of no rain detection 3 the false alarm mean 4 the mean gaussian log error 5 the standard deviation of gaussian log error and log one autocorrelation for a detailed description the reader is invited to refer to hossain and lettenmaier 2006 the srem2d parameters are calibrated for the re gridded dpr sensor for the years 2015 and 2016 srem2d ensembles are generated by perturbing the cmorph reference precipitation with dpr error characteristics a similar procedure is followed for the temporal sampling intervals of 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly time steps a total of 100 realization ensembles are simulated for each case the ensembles represent dpr precipitation retrievals when the reference precipitation i e cmorph is perturbed with the dpr error characteristics for sampling intervals of 3 hour 6 hour and 12 hour the dpr error characteristic expresses the mean behaviour that accounts the space time correlations and intermittency in the satellite precipitation fields the dpr orbital data sampling error can then be propagatedthrough the vic model in terms of ensembles of forcing data as input and the output is the uncertainty bound ofstreamflow the third section focuses on setting up the vic hydrological model by calibrating it for three sampling intervals 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly with the reference rainfall i e cmorph 3 hourly precipitation with respect to observed discharge through which the sampling error propagation can be assessed lastly the uncertainty in streamflow is evaluated by different error statistics each of the above methodology sections is explainedin detail thereafter 4 1 gridding of gpm orbital data the intermittent gpm level 2 orbital data referring to dpr is available at the footprint size of 5 km 5 km dpr sampling errors are complicated functions of sampling geometry and statistical properties of the measured fields ganesh et al 2019 indu and nagesh kumar 2014 fig 3 representsa schematic of the gridding procedure of the level 2 product over the study area to ensure consistent spatial scales with cmorph i e the reference precipitation the dpr orbital data is gridded to 0 25 degree 0 25 degree spatial resolution footprints of all the orbits passing over the study region are collectedand segregated per hourly time periods step 1 in fig 3 once the temporal segregation is done the gridding is carried out by taking the spatial mean of all the footprints lying under a 0 25 degree pixel grid the gridded dpr precipitation can then be accumulated to 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly temporal integration time as shown in step 2 in fig 3 dpr gridded dataare obtained at 0 25 degree 0 25 degree spatial resolution and 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly temporal integration time 4 2 vic model setup for this study the vic 3l hydrological model liang et al 1996 was set up over the hirakud catchment the model is driven by forcing inputs such as meteorological parameters precipitation temperature and wind speed soil parameters vegetation parameters and the digital elevation model dem all the input forcing specifications are summarized briefly in table 1 the vic model is set up at 0 25 degree 0 25 degree spatial resolution and calibrated over the years 2007 2011 with the year 2006 1 year used as the initialization period the cmorph precipitation is used as the reference precipitation forcing the modelis calibratedand validated with respect to the observed in situ streamflow collected from the orissa water resources department some soil parameters cannot be measured in situ as they are not physically observable andheterogeneousin nature these parameters need to be calibrated thereby minimising the difference between observed and simulated streamflow these parameters are illustrated in table 2 the vic model is calibrated and validated for three forcing integration intervals 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly time steps using the corresponding cmorph precipitation as input to the model by calibrating the model in this way for all forcing intervals avoids the uncertainty in streamflow simulations originating from forcing uncertainty the shuffled complex evolution sce algorithm optimization technique is used to calibrate the vic model the sce algorithm duan et al 1992 1993 1994 is an efficient global optimization method developed at the university of arizona that handles non linear problems with high parameter dimensionality the objective function used in our study for shuffled complex evolution algorithm optimization is the mean daily square root of the difference between the observed streamflow and the simulated streamflow the four principles applied by this algorithm are 1 controlled random search 2 implicit clustering 3 complex shuffling and competitive evolution the basic steps of the algorithm for sce are described by duan et al 1993 4 3 evaluation of error statistics the fundamental objective of our study is to investigate how the dpr sampling errors propagate through the vic hydrological model hence ensembles of synthetic dpr precipitation retrievals simulated using the srem2d is used as forcing data in the calibrated vic model the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse and coefficient of determination r2 and were used as the performance indicator for calibration and validation of the vic model as shown in eqs 1 and 2 the nse and r2 and are estimated at the hirakud gauging site where n is the total number of time steps 1 nse 1 i 1 n q sim i q obs i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 2 r 2 n q obs q sim q obs q sim n q obs 2 q obs 2 n q sim 2 q sim 2 2 in order to quantify the propagation of sampling error statistics from precipitation to streamflow two error metrics i e the mean relative error mre of streamflow and the relative root mean square error rrmse are selected the error statistics are defined as follows in eqs 3 and 4 3 m r e k 1 n q k q k k 1 n q k 4 r r m s e 1 n k 1 n q k q k 2 1 n k 1 n q k where q is the reference streamflow q is the satellite forced model streamflow and n is the total number of time steps 5 results and discussion the principal objective of this study is to study the optimum temporal integration time of precipitation from satellites to reduce sampling uncertainty in simulation of hydrological fluxes the vic model is run at three different forcing intervals 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly and these simulations are used as boundary conditions for the routing model to simulate three different daily streamflow estimates whichare compared with in situ observations in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the vic model to the forcing intervals and to find the optimum temporal integration time of precipitation satellites we have come up with the following results 5 1 results of vic model calibration in order to remove the bias due to the different forcing intervals of 3 hour 6 hour and 12 hour the model is calibrated at at these three forcing intervals the calibrated soil parameters are summarized in table 2 as a representative result we have provided the results only for 3 hour forcing interval in fig 4 and the performance scores are indicated in fig 5 and table 3 before the calibration period the nash sutcliffe coefficient is 0 1 and the coefficient of determination is 0 55 after calibration the coefficient of determination and nash sutcliffe coefficient improved to 0 78 and 0 73 respectively nse and r2 are 0 73 and 0 80 for the validation period as discussed in the methodology section the calibrated models are forced with the ensemble of precipitation forcing characterizing the sampling properties of dpr at different temporal intervals the results of srem2d model setup is presented in the following section 5 2 srem2d results the average values of the calibrated parameters for all cases are as follows the pod 0 96 far 4 30 mean gaussian log error is 1 2 the standard deviation of gaussian log error is 1 8 and the lag one autocorrelation is 0 57and are mentioned in table 4 the probability of rain detection for dprfor the year 2015 and 2016 are presented in fig 6 a b fig 6 c d representsthe false alarm distribution for the years 2015 and 2016 two ways by which the reproducibility property of the srem2d can be verified are 1 the consistency of ensemble of cumulative precipitation hyetograph with respect to the reference precipitation and 2 by checking that the simulated precipitation captures the spatial distribution of reference precipitation fig 7 illustrates the cumulative hyetographs where the 100 ensemble realizations obtained by perturbing the dpr error seems to be consistent fig 8 compares the spatial patterns of a precipitation event taken as an example from the monsoon period on 11th of august 2015 as seen by cmorph and a single ensemble realization 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly in this study we have used a lumped calibration for the srem2d parameters for the complete study period i e year 2015 and 2016 our study area receives precipitation mainly during monsoon season june july august and september as calibration period was selected based on the availability of both the dpr orbital data and in situ streamflow data we have the common data period available during two years only from 2015 to 2016 therefore due to the low availability of datasets we have performed calibration annually which is the primary reason for the positive bias some of the previous studies on srem2d have faced similar issues in the calibration parameters due to the calibration period maggioniet al 2017 overallthe spatial structure of the reference precipitation is well captured by the perturbed cmorph precipitation the following points can be concluded from fig 8 1 srem2d can introduce precipitation in pixels where the satellite does not detect precipitation thereby statistically represent the rain detection error the srem2d also assigns zero to pixels where the satellite detects rain statistically illustrating the false detection error the srem2d simulated precipitation is generated at 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly sampling intervals of temporal averages that include the orbital sampling representing the temporal integration time of satellite each of 100 ensemble realization is used to force the calibrated vic model separately to generate three different simulation cases at each satellite temporal integration time in the following section we evaluate the simulated streamflow case which matches with the in situ observations 5 3 analysis of optimum temporal integration time for precipitation forcing the 100 ensembles of streamflow simulations from three different vic simulations 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly are compared with the in situ daily streamflow measurements from this analysis the propagation of precipitation uncertainty in streamflow is evaluated through metrics discussed in section 4 3 fig 9 represents the streamflow hydrographs for a 3 hourly b 6 hourly c 12 hourly for the year 2015 the red solid line represents the observed streamflow the grey shaded area represents the 90 percentiles streamflow bound simulated using the srem2d ensembles the blue solid line represents the median of the simulated streamflow bound the black solid line in the upper axis represents the reference cmorph precipitation fig 10 represents the same as fig 9 for the year 2016 these results indicate that the 3 hourly streamflow uncertainty bound is lower as compared to the 6 hourly and 12 hourly streamflow uncertainty bound similarly the 6 hourly streamflow uncertainty bound is lower than the 12 hourly streamflow uncertainty bound it clearly indicates that with the increase in temporal sampling interval the uncertainty in streamflow bound also increases the median of the 100 streamflow ensembles median for 3 6 and 12 hourly sampling intervals is plotted with respect to the reference streamflow in fig 11 a and b for the years 2015 and 2016 respectively over the june july august and september jjas time period for better visibility the y axis has been plotted on a logarithmic scale it can be observed that the 3 hourly streamflow ensemble envelope is lower than the 6 hourly uncertainty that itself is less than the 12 hourly streamflow ensemble envelope however the 6 hourly streamflow is closer to the reference streamflow than the 3 hourly streamflow further the propagation of dpr precipitation error to streamflow is investigated through statistical analysis fig 12 summarizes the results in the form of taylor diagrams these are a graphical summary of root mean square difference rmsd correlation coefficient cc and standard deviation of median of the 100 ensemble simulated streamflow with respect to the reference streamflow fig 12 a and b represents the taylor diagrams for 2015 and 2016 respectively the statistical indices from taylor plots are summarizedin table 5 as observed from fig 12 and table 5 the rmsd cc and standard deviation of 3 hourly and 6 hourly sampling interval are significantly better than the 12 hourly sampling interval the rmsd for 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly are 133 69 119 71 648 for 2015 and 111 29 76 14 447 79 for 2016 respectively in between the 3 hourly and 6 hourly sampling intervals the 6 hourly shows better closeness to reference from the statistics shown in table 5 it is clear that the rmsd is minimum for the 6 hourly and maximum for the 12 hourly and the standard deviation is also closer to the reference for the 6 hourly these results suggest that an optimum satellite integration time that includes the sampling uncertainty is 6 hours for our study region for further evaluation we have computed the streamflow mean relative error mre and the streamflow relative root mean square error rrmse which are summarized in table 6 the mre for 3 hourly 6 hourly 12 hourly for 2015 are 0 17 0 12 0 57 and for 2016 are 0 12 0 06 0 56 respectively the rrmse for 3 hourly 6 hourly 12 hourly for 2015 are 0 31 0 25 1 43 and for 2016 are 0 25 0 15 1 06 respectively it can be noticed that both mre and rrmse show a similar pattern for both years both mre and rrmse 6 hourly show the least error which justifies the streamflow pattern in figs 9 and 10 the results of this analysis are also in accordance with our previous results that the optimum satellite integration time is of 6 h 6 conclusion the primary objective of this study is to find the optimum temporal integration time of satellites equipped with narrow swath precipitation radar for hydrological simulations this study presents a framework to improvethe understanding of the temporal resolution of satellites in a constellation from a hydrological perspective to achieve this we have devised an experimental setup to find the sensitivity of the variable infiltration capacity vic model to different precipitation forcing intervals the forcing intervals represent the temporal integration time of the satellite used for precipitation estimates we utilize the dpr orbital properties to find its optimum temporal integration time for the simulation of hydrological fluxes to the best of the author s knowledge this is the first study applied on a narrow swath precipitation radar from a hydrological perspective over a catchment in india weused an ensemble based satellite rainfall error model srem2d to simulate synthetic dpr precipitation retrievals orbital data are subjected to low spatial samples for instantaneous passes but vic and other hydrological models rely on observations over the complete spatial domain for its simulations hence using srem2d we generated synthetic precipitation forcing over the complete study domain with error properties of dpr orbital data the srem2d simulated ensembles are forced to the vic model the precipitation sampling error is propagated through the modeland the uncertainty in the streamflow is quantified it is clearthatthe uncertainty bound in streamflow increases with the temporal sampling interval the statistical analysis also showed up that the 6 hourly streamflow analysis gave comparable results to 3 hourly with respect to reference streamflow this observation may bedue to the fact thatthe streamflow pattern depends upon the catchment characteristics such as size shape length width slope etc the methodology of our study can be generalized to any other catchments to help determine the temporal integration time of future precipitation satellite missions such as cubesat based temporal experiment for storms and tropical systems tempest reising et al 2015 and time resolved observations of precipitation structure and storm intensity with a constellation of smallsats tropics blackwell et al 2018 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

srem2d model pierre kirstetter recognize support from nasa 80nm0018f0617 80nssc19k0681 and nnx16al23g appendix a srem2d model the two dimensional satellite rainfall error model srem2d was developed by hossain and lettenmaier 2006 for simulating ensembles of synthetic satellite precipitation fields by perturbing more accurate sources of reference precipitation with the satellite precipitation dpr orbital data error characteristics being intermittent in space and time precipitation affects the hydrologic process overland in the present study the cmorph satellite based precipitation products are considered as the reference precipitation with a spatial resolution of 0 25 degree 0 25 degree and a 3 hourly temporal resolution which is considered as reference owing to its availability at 3 hourly temporal resolution as compared to the daily precipitation records from the indian meteorological department imd the srem2d model utilizes the cmorph reference precipitation fields as input thereby implementing stochastic space time formulations to characterize the multidimensional error structure of gridded dpr precipitation retrievals the sole purpose of using cmorph 3 hourly precipitation as the reference precipitation instead of imerg precipitation is due to the fact that imerg precipitation product is derived from the combined use of passive microwave pmw and infrared ir satellites comprising the gpm constellation considering this fact the use of imerg precipitation product would lead to a biased error characterization of srem2d perturbation this is mainly due to similar rain no rain characterization of imerg and gpm 2a ku orbital product a single dpr orbital pass do not cover the entire region of the study area which leaves pixels with no data of rainy no rainy pixels whereas hydrological model needs uniform data as input to the model with rainy no rainy pixels with rainy pixels having intensity therefore in this study we utilize srem2d model to simulate perturbed dpr orbital data observations throughout the pixels this will be used to force the hydrological model to simulate stream flow and study the impact of precipitation sampling error on streamflow simulations the srem2d model hossain et al 2009 accounts for the error statistics in three dimensions 1 temporal dimension how does the error vary in time 2 spatial dimension how does the error vary in space and 3 retrieval dimension what is the bias of the precipitation estimation over rainy areas a satellite estimation can either result in a rainy pixel or a non rainy pixel therefore satellite precipitation retrieval can be any one of the four possible outcomes 1 successful rain detection hit 2 unsuccessful rain detection miss 3 successful no rain detection hit no rain and unsuccessful no rain detection false alarm table 7 illustrates the four outcomes considering the four possible outcomes of satellite precipitation retrieval the srem2d takes into account the spatial structure of the error in the satellite precipitation dpr gridded precipitation with respect to reference precipitation cmorph precipitation and models the joint probability of successful detection of rainy and no rainy pixels in a precipitation system the srem2d is forced with the reference precipitation as the input forcing and generates the output in terms of ensembles of satellite based realizations of precipitation the four outcomes referred in table 7 come out with 4 conditional outputs in the srem2d model 1 when a reference precipitation addresses precipitation in a given pixel the srem2d generates spatially correlated uniform field r 0 1 and compares the random numbers generated with the probability of rain detection prain if the random number generated turns out to be less than prain r prain which is a hit case the srem2d evaluates the to be nonzero satellite precipitation precipsat using a multiplicative error parameter with the reference precipitation precipref as shown in eq 5 5 precip sat precip ref ε s where ɛs is a multiplicative satellite error parameter that is assumed to be lognormally distributed with given mean and standard deviation that is obtained with the calibration of the srem2d model the lognormality of the distribution of ε s is positive in nature the log transformation of the statistical relationship log precipsat log precipref transforms the ε s to a gaussian deviate ɛ with n µ σ statistics where µ and σ are the mean and standard deviation respectively the multiplicative mean mu and standard deviation s of ε s in terms of µ and σ are determined by the following eqs 6 and 7 6 mu exp μ 0 5 σ 2 7 s 2 e x p σ 2 1 x e x p 2 μ σ 2 to model the correlated error sequence a lag one autocorrelation function was also used for the propagation of µ and σ 2 for a gaussian random variable the equations leading to the propagation of µ and σ2 are represented in eqs 8 and 9 8 μ i μ ρ ε i 1 μ 9 σ i 2 σ 2 1 ρ 2 where time index i represents discrete time step and ρ 2 is the lag one autocorrelation of ɛ if the random number generated turns out to be greater than prain r prain it is the considered that the satellite precipitation has falsely detected precipitation and srem2d assigns a zero value to the pixel at a specific time the third and fourth outcome depends on the fact that the reference precipitation reports a zero value when the reference precipitation reports zero value srem2d implements a bernoulli trial using uniform distribution with a correlated structure to conclude if the analogous satellite precipitation would be zero or not if the random number generated from the uniform field r 0 1 turns out to be less than the probability of no rain detection pno rain r pno rain then the srem2d assign a zero precipitation to the pixel at that time specific time step indicating a hit to no rain detection in case of vice versa if r 0 1 is greater than probability of no rain detection r pno rain indicating that the satellite precipitation has missed the reference precipitation the precipitation value is evaluated on the criteria of a probability density function of false alarm rate the false alarm probability density function is defined to characterize the probability distribution of the satellite estimates when there are misses over non rainy pixels the false alarm probability density function tends to appear exponential in nature hossain and anagnostou 2006 the srem2d model distinguishes itself from other error models due to its capability to realistically model the satellite precipitation rates in addition it also models the false alarms and the missed precipitation the significant srem2d parameters which need to be calibrated are the probability of no rain detection mean and standard deviation of retrieval error and the mean missed precipitation the srem2d parameters are calibrated with the dpr orbital precipitation 
4911,global precipitation estimation depends on constellations of mainly passive microwave sensors along with satellite radars and constellations of geosynchronous earth orbit infrared sensors with passive microwave constellations a persisting challenge is the limited sampling which impacts applications such as hydrological modeling this study presents a framework to examine the impact of the global precipitation measurement gpm orbital sampling on streamflow simulations orbital data from the gpm dual precipitation radar dpr 2a ku is used within the variable infiltration capacity vic model to derive ensembles of runoff simulations ensembles of synthetic precipitation fields are generated at different sampling intervals which are representative of gpm orbital data products with the satellite rainfall error model srem 2d over the hirakud catchment in the indian subcontinent over a period of two years 2015 2016 the noaa ncep climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph satellite based gridded rainfall product is considered as the reference rainfall for our study sampling uncertainty in orbital precipitation data is shown to amplify in streamflow simulations the statistical analysis indicates that increasing sampling rates tend to generate more realistic land surface fluxes the results from our study indicate that streamflow simulations from vic model using precipitation forcing at 6 hourly integration outperforms the simulations as compared to 3 hourly and 12 hourly forcing integration times this is exemplified by the statistical indices with mean relative error of 0 17 for simulations with 3 hourly forcing 0 12 for simulation with 6 hourly forcing and 0 57 for 12 hourly forcing the relative root mean square error rmse for 3 hourly 6 hourly 12 hourly for 2015 are 0 31 0 25 1 43 and for 2016 are 0 25 0 15 1 06 respectively it can be noticed that both mean relative error and relative rmse show a similar pattern for both years a generic framework is therefore proposed to study the manifestation of satellite constellation sampling uncertainty in hydrologic simulations which are crucial for future missions such as the cubesat based temporal experiment for storms and tropical systems and the time resolved observations of precipitation structure and storm intensity with a constellation of smallsats keywords gpm srem2d orbital data sampling uncertainty precipitation 1 introduction precipitation estimates from space borne constellations are quintessential for studies pertaining to global water and energy cycles skofronick jackson et al 2017 and it remains one of the key inputs for all model based hydrologic studies involving climatic extremes of flood and drought monitoring adegoke and carleton 2002 bolten et al 2010 water resources management chen et al 1996 liang et al 1994 hydrometeorology sellers et al 1997 sorooshian et al 2005 nair and indu 2019 shrestha et al 2019 and crop modelling han et al 2014 wang et al 2007 even though modern satellite constellations of conically scanning microwave sensors redefine precipitation measurement scale our ability to collect satellite data far out spaces and sensibly assimilate it let alone understand it recent constellations have supported the next class of earth and space science missions and tailor measurement characteristics for evolving scientific understanding till date satellite constellations addressing earth s coverage have focused on circular orbits lüders 1961 gobetz 1963 easton and brescia 1969 walker 1970 1982 ballard 1980 jorgensen 1980 before year 1965 low earth orbits were only thought of owing to incapability of boosters for placing satellites into geostationary orbits lüders 1961 gobetz 1963 constellations with elliptical orbits have also been considered for missions requiring coverage of northern hemisphere draim 1985 singh et al 2020 found that a four satellite constellation with 24 hour sampling interval requires 60 less vehicle mass budget propellent and maintenance cost than a 48 hour sampling interval over a satellite lifetime the need for global satellite services dictates that satellite constellations should provide a global coverage but the specific question remains what decides the minimum number of satellites required to ensure optimum sampling for hydroclimatology the rapidly growing records of microwave based precipitation data made available from constellations have instigated a pressing need towards evaluating the associated uncertainty which arise from different sources such as retrieval error spatial temporal sampling error and sensor dependent error pertaining to microwave remote sensing most of the studies in literature focus on gridded data products fewer studies exist on evaluating the uncertainty inherent in orbital data products evaluations of the latter are essential as they potentially cause large uncertainties during real time flood forecasting studies especially at the watershed scale moreover a realistic representation of sampling considerations becomes more evident while analysing orbital data sensitivity analyses focusing on the impact of precipitation uncertainty from orbital data on hydrological models have garnered significant interest in recent decades beria et al 2017 hong et al 2007 hossain et al 2004 hossain and huffman 2008 hossain and lettenmaier 2006 kidd et al 2003 maggioni et al 2011 mcmillan et al 2011 nikolopoulos et al 2010 vergara et al 2013 hossain and anagnostou 2006a hossain and anagnostou 2004 the error components of satellite precipitation estimates tend to interact nonlinearly with the hydrologic modelling uncertainty components hossain and anagnostou 2005 indu and nagesh kumar 2015 hossain and anagnostou 2006a in particular sampling uncertainty is known to propagate through the hydrological models vergara et al 2013 a proper understanding of precipitation sampling uncertainty is key for their usage in hydrological and hydrodynamic models for runoff simulations hossain et al 2004 carried out a sensitivity analysis to understand the implication of satellite passive microwave pmw rainfall retrieval and sampling errors on flood prediction uncertainty they found that the uncertainty in flood prediction stemming from a 3 hour pmw sampling is comparable to the hourly sampling and increases to a factor of 2 3 times for a 6 hour sampling nijssen and lettenmaier 2004 quantified the effect of precipitation sampling errors on predictions of land surface fluxes anticipating the global precipitation measurement gpm satellites they found that the streamflow estimates were biased due to sampling errors the bias in the streamflow increases with the sampling interval and drainage area hong et al 2006 developed an uncertainty analysis framework based on monte carlo simulations to quantify error characteristics of satellite based precipitation and assess the influence of error propagation into hydrologic simulation they designed the precipitation estimation error as a fixed ratio of rain rates thereby improving the quantification of precipitation estimation error and uncertainty assessment of the error propagation into hydrologic simulation hossain and huffman 2008 developed a framework of error metrics for high resolution rainfall products that can advance their hydrologic application it was observed that working at finer space time scales for satellite rainfall estimation requires probabilistic measures that are mathematically amenable to space time stochastic simulation of satellite data aghakouchak et al 2009 developed a stochastic model for uncertainty analysis of satellite rainfall fields over north and south carolina the generated ensembles were compared with original satellite estimates with respect to statistical properties and spatial dependencies the results showed that the model can be used to describe the uncertainties associated with trmm multi satellite precipitation estimates nikolopoulos et al 2010 performed a data driven numerical experiment to understand the scale relationships of error propagation over complex terrains using a satellite rainfall error model the results showed that use of satellite rainfall for flood simulation depends strongly on the scale of application and satellite product resolution gebregiorgis et al 2012 investigated the effect of three independent bias components of satellite rainfall estimation hit bias missed and false precipitation on the uncertainty of runoff for a physically based hydrological model it was observed that there is high correlation of runoff error with hit bias indicating the need for improving the satellite rainfall products s ability to detect rainfall more consistently for flood prediction most of these studies evaluate synthetic gpm products or blended precipitation products they assume the gridded level3 products to display homogeneous uncertainty characteristics krajewski et al 1991 ogden and julien 1994 dinku et al 2002 syed et al 2003 wang et al 2009 mohamoud and prieto 2012 kavetski and franks 2002 nijssen and lettenmaier 2004 bárdossy and das 2008 detailed error characterization of gridded satellite precipitation has shown that it is a complex manifestation of retrieval and sampling errors arising from multiple orbital products huffman et al 2007 joyce et al 2004 gebregiorgis et al 2018 the manifestation of sampling errors is due to infrequent revisits of low orbiting satellite platforms wilheit 1988 bell et al 1990 indu and nagesh kumar 2015 scheel et al 2011 ganesh et al 2019 the experimental setup of this study has been organized to address the crucial research question how does the intermittency caused by low sampling platforms propagate through a hydrological model and contribute to the streamflow uncertainty this study complements the existing literature by presenting a generic framework to analyse the sampling of microwave based precipitation from orbital data products the global precipitation measurement gpm mission comprises a constellation of twelve satellites with a core observatory having the dual frequency precipitation radar dpr and the gpm microwave imager gmi hou et al 2014 we present case study results of a novel approach which can materialize the sampling effects of microwave sensors as part of a constellation through hydrologic modelling a multidimensional satellite rainfall error model srem2d hossain and lettenmaier 2006 is used to quantify the error characteristics of gpm orbital data products ensembles of synthetic precipitation fields are generated to be representative of the inherent error characteristics of orbital precipitation data products the hydrological model selected for the study is the variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1996 hydrological model the article has been organized in the following manner section 2 provides a description of the study area and section 3 summarizes the data sets and hydrologic model used section 4 describes the overall methodology of the study which includes the setting up the vic hydrological model and the satellite rainfall error model srem2d evaluation of the sampling error characteristics are also discussed in this section section 5 presents the results and discussions of the work over a predominant

located between 19 5 degrees and 24 degrees n latitudes and from 80 degrees to 84 degrees e longitudes fig 1 a it is a sub catchment of mahanadi river basin fig 1 b located in the eastern part of the indian subcontinent with an area of approx 85 200 km2 the mahanadi river basin is one of the major basins in the indian sub continent with an area of 141 600 km2 which covers major parts of odisha chhattisgarh small portions of madhya pradesh and jharkhand before flowing to the bay of bengal the hirakud catchment receives an annual rainfall of around 1600 mm the bulk of the precipitation falling in the period from july to september and it experiences a tropical monsoon type of climate beria et al 2017 this catchment is selected for the study owing to the frequent devastating floods crippling the economic development of the region therefore hydrological models are widely usedin this catchment for improving flood predictions the meteorology and climatology of the catchment are significantly influencedby the geographical location of the catchment with respect to the bay of bengal from where most of the weather systems originate in addition the orography of the eastern ghats influences the rainfall pattern over the catchment to a great extent as the study region is on the upstream of a major dam it is most suitable for implementing the vic model 3 model and data description 3 1 vic model the variable infiltration capacity vic model is used to simulate land surface states over the study area the vic model liang et al 1994 is a large scale physically based semi distributed macro scale hydrological model that represents the land surface in a grid based format it simulates the exchange of moisture and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere thereby solving the hydrologic fluxes in water and energy balance mode the vic model distinguishes itself from other models in terms of including multiple soil layers with variable infiltration multiple vegetation classes in a single grid cell and nonlinear baseflow along with these processes the model recreates land surface processes such as evapotranspiration gao et al 2009 soil moisture changes and runoff the grid cells of the vic model are modelled independently of each other with no horizontal flow across grids the soil properties of multiple subsurface soil layers are representedin terms of saturated hydraulic conductivity soil layer depth bulk density infiltration capacity and soil moisture diffusion parameter gao et al 2009 the variable infiltration curve zhao et al 1980 is used tocharacterizethe spatial heterogeneity of runoff generation for the generation of baseflow the model uses the arno model conceptualization franchini and paciani 1991 to generate runoff and baseflow at outputs of each grid cell a routing model developed by lohmann et al 1996 is used which assumes runoff to be linear and time invariant the routing model developed assures that water does not flow back from the channel to the grid to route streamflow the model utilizes the first differenced transfer function excess rainfall and unit hydrograph by a deconvolution iterative technique fdtf eruhdit by duband et al 1993 with a linearized saint venant equation that assumes the runoff transport process to be linear stable and time invariant the vic model has been used for different studies pertaining to land surface fluxes and states such as by maurer et al 2002 zhu and lettenmaier 2007 hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 wood et al 2002 wood et al 2005 wood and lettenmaier 2006 nijssen and lettenmaier 2004 pradhan and indu 2019 3 2 datasets 3 2 1 gpm precipitation product gpm core satellite jointly developed by japan and the united states carries two observation instruments namely the dual frequency precipitation radar dpr developed by japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa and the gpm microwave imager gmi developed by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the gpm

per the standard nomenclature the gpm mission was commenced with an objective to provide more accurate estimates of the rate of transfer of water from the atmosphere to the surface at local and global scales thereby reducing the source of uncertainty in the global water and energy budget for the present study the gpm level 2 orbital product from dpr 2a ku precipitation radar hereafter it is referred as dpr is used for the time periodof 2 years 2015 and 2016 3 2 2 cmorph precipitation products the noaa ncep climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph satellite based rainfall

orbital satellite microwave observations and geostationary satellite infrared data more details of this product canbe obtained from joyce et al 2004 3 2 3 other datasets used the datasets utilized in

methodology the key objective of this study is to find the optimum forcing integration time of orbital data product with narrow swath width that would minimize sampling uncertainty in the simulation of streamflow we structureda methodology using advanced hydrological and statistical models it should be noted that this methodology can be applied to any orbital data product to find its optimum temporal integration time for hydrological applications in this study we assess the optimum temporal integration time of the dpr for hydrological applications most studies have focussed primarily on sampling uncertainty that arises from the relatively infrequent intervals at which pmw sensors pass over any point two satellite rainfall algorithms with similar bias and root mean squared error rmse can have much different error propagation properties when used in hydrologic models lee and anagnostou 2004 to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first study towards the quantification of uncertainty in hydrological fluxes caused to sampling intermittency ofdpr orbital data a possible approach is to run hydrological simulations with precipitation forcing available only during the overpass times of satellite platforms this approach would make it challenging to disentangle the impact of orbital sampling from other error sources in the analysis framework because the intermittent precipitation forcing combines with other error sources associated with the hydrologic model structure and parameters to better isolate the satellite sampling error a background forcing is provided to the hydrologic model by a gridded product which provides continuous precipitation information in space and time the perturbation of the background by the orbital precipitation and the corresponding impact on the hydrologic model output enables to better isolate the satellite sampling error the representativeness of precipitation sampling evolves with spatial and temporal accumulation lebel et al 1987 while satellite sampled aggregated rainfall averages in space and time include error due to observation intermittence it is assumed that an optimal time aggregation can be identified in this framework in order to overcome the low sampling frequency of dpr we utilize the srem2d model to simulate dpr uniformly throughout the study area our intention is not to estimate the error of dpr orbital precipitation data but rather to understand the implication of likely dpr sampling errors for the simulation of hydrological fluxes and states in this study we estimate sampling errors of space time rainfall averages sampled by the gpm constellation satellites by aggregating them over a space scale of 0 25 degree and time scales of 3 6 and 12 h our key objective is to evaluate the effect of sampling using these aggregated rainfall data on streamflow simulation when forced into a grid based hydrologic model vic therefore to address this issue in our methodology we have used the srem2d model which corrupts the reference data with the error characteristics of dpr which includes the sampling error the main aim of the srem2d model in our methodology is to generate ensembles of aggregated precipitation forcing at intervals of 3hrs 6hrs and 12hrs representing the sampling intervals of dpr orbital product the overall flowchart of the methodology is presented in fig 2 which includes three sub sections the first section involves gridding of the dpr orbital data the second section describes the formulation of the satellite rainfall error model used to simulate synthetic dpr rainfall retrievals by corrupting the reference rainfall with the sampling error characteristics of dpr orbital data this step ensures that the synthetic dpr precipitation retrievals have the same sampling characteristics as that of dpr data in the present study the cmorph satellite based precipitation product joyce et al 2004 is consideredas the reference rainfall due to its availability at high spatial and temporal resolution 3 hourly in the present study the srem2d precipitation error model is used to simulate ensembles of synthetic precipitation fields see appendix a for details the srem2d is calibratedfor its error metrics parameters the parameters are 1 the probability of rain detection as a function of the reference precipitation 2 the probability of no rain detection 3 the false alarm mean 4 the mean gaussian log error 5 the standard deviation of gaussian log error and log one autocorrelation for a detailed description the reader is invited to refer to hossain and lettenmaier 2006 the srem2d parameters are calibrated for the re gridded dpr sensor for the years 2015 and 2016 srem2d ensembles are generated by perturbing the cmorph reference precipitation with dpr error characteristics a similar procedure is followed for the temporal sampling intervals of 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly time steps a total of 100 realization ensembles are simulated for each case the ensembles represent dpr precipitation retrievals when the reference precipitation i e cmorph is perturbed with the dpr error characteristics for sampling intervals of 3 hour 6 hour and 12 hour the dpr error characteristic expresses the mean behaviour that accounts the space time correlations and intermittency in the satellite precipitation fields the dpr orbital data sampling error can then be propagatedthrough the vic model in terms of ensembles of forcing data as input and the output is the uncertainty bound ofstreamflow the third section focuses on setting up the vic hydrological model by calibrating it for three sampling intervals 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly with the reference rainfall i e cmorph 3 hourly precipitation with respect to observed discharge through which the sampling error propagation can be assessed lastly the uncertainty in streamflow is evaluated by different error statistics each of the above methodology sections is explainedin detail thereafter 4 1 gridding of gpm orbital data the intermittent gpm level 2 orbital data referring to dpr is available at the footprint size of 5 km 5 km dpr sampling errors are complicated functions of sampling geometry and statistical properties of the measured fields ganesh et al 2019 indu and nagesh kumar 2014 fig 3 representsa schematic of the gridding procedure of the level 2 product over the study area to ensure consistent spatial scales with cmorph i e the reference precipitation the dpr orbital data is gridded to 0 25 degree 0 25 degree spatial resolution footprints of all the orbits passing over the study region are collectedand segregated per hourly time periods step 1 in fig 3 once the temporal segregation is done the gridding is carried out by taking the spatial mean of all the footprints lying under a 0 25 degree pixel grid the gridded dpr precipitation can then be accumulated to 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly temporal integration time as shown in step 2 in fig 3 dpr gridded dataare obtained at 0 25 degree 0 25 degree spatial resolution and 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly temporal integration time 4 2 vic model setup for this study the vic 3l hydrological model liang et al 1996 was set up over the hirakud catchment the model is driven by forcing inputs such as meteorological parameters precipitation temperature and wind speed soil parameters vegetation parameters and the digital elevation model dem all the input forcing specifications are summarized briefly in table 1 the vic model is set up at 0 25 degree 0 25 degree spatial resolution and calibrated over the years 2007 2011 with the year 2006 1 year used as the initialization period the cmorph precipitation is used as the reference precipitation forcing the modelis calibratedand validated with respect to the observed in situ streamflow collected from the orissa water resources department some soil parameters cannot be measured in situ as they are not physically observable andheterogeneousin nature these parameters need to be calibrated thereby minimising the difference between observed and simulated streamflow these parameters are illustrated in table 2 the vic model is calibrated and validated for three forcing integration intervals 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly time steps using the corresponding cmorph precipitation as input to the model by calibrating the model in this way for all forcing intervals avoids the uncertainty in streamflow simulations originating from forcing uncertainty the shuffled complex evolution sce algorithm optimization technique is used to calibrate the vic model the sce algorithm duan et al 1992 1993 1994 is an efficient global optimization method developed at the university of arizona that handles non linear problems with high parameter dimensionality the objective function used in our study for shuffled complex evolution algorithm optimization is the mean daily square root of the difference between the observed streamflow and the simulated streamflow the four principles applied by this algorithm are 1 controlled random search 2 implicit clustering 3 complex shuffling and competitive evolution the basic steps of the algorithm for sce are described by duan et al 1993 4 3 evaluation of error statistics the fundamental objective of our study is to investigate how the dpr sampling errors propagate through the vic hydrological model hence ensembles of synthetic dpr precipitation retrievals simulated using the srem2d is used as forcing data in the calibrated vic model the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse and coefficient of determination r2 and were used as the performance indicator for calibration and validation of the vic model as shown in eqs 1 and 2 the nse and r2 and are estimated at the hirakud gauging site where n is the total number of time steps 1 nse 1 i 1 n q sim i q obs i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 2 r 2 n q obs q sim q obs q sim n q obs 2 q obs 2 n q sim 2 q sim 2 2 in order to quantify the propagation of sampling error statistics from precipitation to streamflow two error metrics i e the mean relative error mre of streamflow and the relative root mean square error rrmse are selected the error statistics are defined as follows in eqs 3 and 4 3 m r e k 1 n q k q k k 1 n q k 4 r r m s e 1 n k 1 n q k q k 2 1 n k 1 n q k where q is the reference streamflow q is the satellite forced model streamflow and n is the total number of time steps 5 results and discussion the principal objective of this study is to study the optimum temporal integration time of precipitation from satellites to reduce sampling uncertainty in simulation of hydrological fluxes the vic model is run at three different forcing intervals 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly and these simulations are used as boundary conditions for the routing model to simulate three different daily streamflow estimates whichare compared with in situ observations in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the vic model to the forcing intervals and to find the optimum temporal integration time of precipitation satellites we have come up with the following results 5 1 results of vic model calibration in order to remove the bias due to the different forcing intervals of 3 hour 6 hour and 12 hour the model is calibrated at at these three forcing intervals the calibrated soil parameters are summarized in table 2 as a representative result we have provided the results only for 3 hour forcing interval in fig 4 and the performance scores are indicated in fig 5 and table 3 before the calibration period the nash sutcliffe coefficient is 0 1 and the coefficient of determination is 0 55 after calibration the coefficient of determination and nash sutcliffe coefficient improved to 0 78 and 0 73 respectively nse and r2 are 0 73 and 0 80 for the validation period as discussed in the methodology section the calibrated models are forced with the ensemble of precipitation forcing characterizing the sampling properties of dpr at different temporal intervals the results of srem2d model setup is presented in the following section 5 2 srem2d results the average values of the calibrated parameters for all cases are as follows the pod 0 96 far 4 30 mean gaussian log error is 1 2 the standard deviation of gaussian log error is 1 8 and the lag one autocorrelation is 0 57and are mentioned in table 4 the probability of rain detection for dprfor the year 2015 and 2016 are presented in fig 6 a b fig 6 c d representsthe false alarm distribution for the years 2015 and 2016 two ways by which the reproducibility property of the srem2d can be verified are 1 the consistency of ensemble of cumulative precipitation hyetograph with respect to the reference precipitation and 2 by checking that the simulated precipitation captures the spatial distribution of reference precipitation fig 7 illustrates the cumulative hyetographs where the 100 ensemble realizations obtained by perturbing the dpr error seems to be consistent fig 8 compares the spatial patterns of a precipitation event taken as an example from the monsoon period on 11th of august 2015 as seen by cmorph and a single ensemble realization 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly in this study we have used a lumped calibration for the srem2d parameters for the complete study period i e year 2015 and 2016 our study area receives precipitation mainly during monsoon season june july august and september as calibration period was selected based on the availability of both the dpr orbital data and in situ streamflow data we have the common data period available during two years only from 2015 to 2016 therefore due to the low availability of datasets we have performed calibration annually which is the primary reason for the positive bias some of the previous studies on srem2d have faced similar issues in the calibration parameters due to the calibration period maggioniet al 2017 overallthe spatial structure of the reference precipitation is well captured by the perturbed cmorph precipitation the following points can be concluded from fig 8 1 srem2d can introduce precipitation in pixels where the satellite does not detect precipitation thereby statistically represent the rain detection error the srem2d also assigns zero to pixels where the satellite detects rain statistically illustrating the false detection error the srem2d simulated precipitation is generated at 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly sampling intervals of temporal averages that include the orbital sampling representing the temporal integration time of satellite each of 100 ensemble realization is used to force the calibrated vic model separately to generate three different simulation cases at each satellite temporal integration time in the following section we evaluate the simulated streamflow case which matches with the in situ observations 5 3 analysis of optimum temporal integration time for precipitation forcing the 100 ensembles of streamflow simulations from three different vic simulations 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly are compared with the in situ daily streamflow measurements from this analysis the propagation of precipitation uncertainty in streamflow is evaluated through metrics discussed in section 4 3 fig 9 represents the streamflow hydrographs for a 3 hourly b 6 hourly c 12 hourly for the year 2015 the red solid line represents the observed streamflow the grey shaded area represents the 90 percentiles streamflow bound simulated using the srem2d ensembles the blue solid line represents the median of the simulated streamflow bound the black solid line in the upper axis represents the reference cmorph precipitation fig 10 represents the same as fig 9 for the year 2016 these results indicate that the 3 hourly streamflow uncertainty bound is lower as compared to the 6 hourly and 12 hourly streamflow uncertainty bound similarly the 6 hourly streamflow uncertainty bound is lower than the 12 hourly streamflow uncertainty bound it clearly indicates that with the increase in temporal sampling interval the uncertainty in streamflow bound also increases the median of the 100 streamflow ensembles median for 3 6 and 12 hourly sampling intervals is plotted with respect to the reference streamflow in fig 11 a and b for the years 2015 and 2016 respectively over the june july august and september jjas time period for better visibility the y axis has been plotted on a logarithmic scale it can be observed that the 3 hourly streamflow ensemble envelope is lower than the 6 hourly uncertainty that itself is less than the 12 hourly streamflow ensemble envelope however the 6 hourly streamflow is closer to the reference streamflow than the 3 hourly streamflow further the propagation of dpr precipitation error to streamflow is investigated through statistical analysis fig 12 summarizes the results in the form of taylor diagrams these are a graphical summary of root mean square difference rmsd correlation coefficient cc and standard deviation of median of the 100 ensemble simulated streamflow with respect to the reference streamflow fig 12 a and b represents the taylor diagrams for 2015 and 2016 respectively the statistical indices from taylor plots are summarizedin table 5 as observed from fig 12 and table 5 the rmsd cc and standard deviation of 3 hourly and 6 hourly sampling interval are significantly better than the 12 hourly sampling interval the rmsd for 3 hourly 6 hourly and 12 hourly are 133 69 119 71 648 for 2015 and 111 29 76 14 447 79 for 2016 respectively in between the 3 hourly and 6 hourly sampling intervals the 6 hourly shows better closeness to reference from the statistics shown in table 5 it is clear that the rmsd is minimum for the 6 hourly and maximum for the 12 hourly and the standard deviation is also closer to the reference for the 6 hourly these results suggest that an optimum satellite integration time that includes the sampling uncertainty is 6 hours for our study region for further evaluation we have computed the streamflow mean relative error mre and the streamflow relative root mean square error rrmse which are summarized in table 6 the mre for 3 hourly 6 hourly 12 hourly for 2015 are 0 17 0 12 0 57 and for 2016 are 0 12 0 06 0 56 respectively the rrmse for 3 hourly 6 hourly 12 hourly for 2015 are 0 31 0 25 1 43 and for 2016 are 0 25 0 15 1 06 respectively it can be noticed that both mre and rrmse show a similar pattern for both years both mre and rrmse 6 hourly show the least error which justifies the streamflow pattern in figs 9 and 10 the results of this analysis are also in accordance with our previous results that the optimum satellite integration time is of 6 h 6 conclusion the primary objective of this study is to find the optimum temporal integration time of satellites equipped with narrow swath precipitation radar for hydrological simulations this study presents a framework to improvethe understanding of the temporal resolution of satellites in a constellation from a hydrological perspective to achieve this we have devised an experimental setup to find the sensitivity of the variable infiltration capacity vic model to different precipitation forcing intervals the forcing intervals represent the temporal integration time of the satellite used for precipitation estimates we utilize the dpr orbital properties to find its optimum temporal integration time for the simulation of hydrological fluxes to the best of the author s knowledge this is the first study applied on a narrow swath precipitation radar from a hydrological perspective over a catchment in india weused an ensemble based satellite rainfall error model srem2d to simulate synthetic dpr precipitation retrievals orbital data are subjected to low spatial samples for instantaneous passes but vic and other hydrological models rely on observations over the complete spatial domain for its simulations hence using srem2d we generated synthetic precipitation forcing over the complete study domain with error properties of dpr orbital data the srem2d simulated ensembles are forced to the vic model the precipitation sampling error is propagated through the modeland the uncertainty in the streamflow is quantified it is clearthatthe uncertainty bound in streamflow increases with the temporal sampling interval the statistical analysis also showed up that the 6 hourly streamflow analysis gave comparable results to 3 hourly with respect to reference streamflow this observation may bedue to the fact thatthe streamflow pattern depends upon the catchment characteristics such as size shape length width slope etc the methodology of our study can be generalized to any other catchments to help determine the temporal integration time of

srem2d model pierre kirstetter recognize support from nasa 80nm0018f0617 80nssc19k0681 and nnx16al23g appendix a srem2d model the two dimensional satellite rainfall error model srem2d was developed by hossain and lettenmaier 2006 for simulating ensembles of synthetic satellite precipitation fields by perturbing more accurate sources of reference precipitation with the satellite precipitation dpr orbital data error characteristics being intermittent in space and time precipitation affects the hydrologic process overland in the present study the cmorph satellite based precipitation products are considered as the reference precipitation with a spatial resolution of 0 25 degree 0 25 degree and a 3 hourly temporal resolution which is considered as reference owing to its availability at 3 hourly temporal resolution as compared to the daily precipitation records from the indian meteorological department imd the srem2d model utilizes the cmorph reference precipitation fields as input thereby implementing stochastic space time formulations to characterize the multidimensional error structure of gridded dpr precipitation retrievals the sole purpose of using cmorph 3 hourly precipitation as the reference precipitation instead of imerg precipitation is due to the fact that imerg precipitation product is derived from the combined use of passive microwave pmw and infrared ir satellites comprising the gpm constellation considering this fact the use of imerg precipitation product would lead to a biased error characterization of srem2d perturbation this is mainly due to similar rain no rain characterization of imerg and gpm 2a ku orbital product a single dpr orbital pass do not cover the entire region of the study area which leaves pixels with no data of rainy no rainy pixels whereas hydrological model needs uniform data as input to the model with rainy no rainy pixels with rainy pixels having intensity therefore in this study we utilize srem2d model to simulate perturbed dpr orbital data observations throughout the pixels this will be used to force the hydrological model to simulate stream flow and study the impact of precipitation sampling error on streamflow simulations the srem2d model hossain et al 2009 accounts for the error statistics in three dimensions 1 temporal dimension how does the error vary in time 2 spatial dimension how does the error vary in space and 3 retrieval dimension what is the bias of the precipitation estimation over rainy areas a satellite estimation can either result in a rainy pixel or a non rainy pixel therefore satellite precipitation retrieval can be any one of the four possible outcomes 1 successful rain detection hit 2 unsuccessful rain detection miss 3 successful no rain detection hit no rain and unsuccessful no rain detection false alarm table 7 illustrates the four outcomes considering the four possible outcomes of satellite precipitation retrieval the srem2d takes into account the spatial structure of the error in the satellite precipitation dpr gridded precipitation with respect to reference precipitation cmorph precipitation and models the joint probability of successful detection of rainy and no rainy pixels in a precipitation system the srem2d is forced with the reference precipitation as the input forcing and generates the output in terms of ensembles of satellite based realizations of precipitation the four outcomes referred in table 7 come out with 4 conditional outputs in the srem2d model 1 when a reference precipitation addresses precipitation in a given pixel the srem2d generates spatially correlated uniform field r 0 1 and compares the random numbers generated with the probability of rain detection prain if the random number generated turns out to be less than prain r prain which is a hit case the srem2d evaluates the to be nonzero satellite precipitation precipsat using a multiplicative error parameter with the reference precipitation precipref as shown in eq 5 5 precip sat precip ref ε s where ɛs is a multiplicative satellite error parameter that is assumed to be lognormally distributed with given mean and standard deviation that is obtained with the calibration of the srem2d model the lognormality of the distribution of ε s is positive in nature the log transformation of the statistical relationship log precipsat log precipref transforms the ε s to a gaussian deviate ɛ with n µ σ statistics where µ and σ are the mean and standard deviation respectively the multiplicative mean mu and standard deviation s of ε s in terms of µ and σ are determined by the following eqs 6 and 7 6 mu exp μ 0 5 σ 2 7 s 2 e x p σ 2 1 x e x p 2 μ σ 2 to model the correlated error sequence a lag one autocorrelation function was also used for the propagation of µ and σ 2 for a gaussian random variable the equations leading to the propagation of µ and σ2 are represented in eqs 8 and 9 8 μ i μ ρ ε i 1 μ 9 σ i 2 σ 2 1 ρ 2 where time index i represents discrete time step and ρ 2 is the lag one autocorrelation of ɛ if the random number generated turns out to be greater than prain r prain it is the considered that the satellite precipitation has falsely detected precipitation and srem2d assigns a zero value to the pixel at a specific time the third and fourth outcome depends on the fact that the reference precipitation reports a zero value when the reference precipitation reports zero value srem2d implements a bernoulli trial using uniform distribution with a correlated structure to conclude if the analogous satellite precipitation would be zero or not if the random number generated from the uniform field r 0 1 turns out to be less than the probability of no rain detection pno rain r pno rain then the srem2d assign a zero precipitation to the pixel at that time specific time step indicating a hit to no rain detection in case of vice versa if r 0 1 is greater than probability of no rain detection r pno rain indicating that the satellite precipitation has missed the reference precipitation the precipitation value is evaluated on the criteria of a probability density function of false alarm rate the false alarm probability density function is defined to characterize the probability distribution of the satellite estimates when there are misses over non rainy pixels the false alarm probability density function tends to appear exponential in nature hossain and anagnostou 2006 the srem2d model distinguishes itself from other error models due to its capability to realistically model the satellite precipitation rates in addition it also models the false alarms and the missed precipitation the significant srem2d parameters which need to be calibrated are the probability of no rain detection mean and standard deviation of retrieval error and the mean missed precipitation the srem2d parameters are calibrated with the dpr orbital precipitation

with the assistance of baptiste françois associate editor the discharge flow process for flood control of a gate controlled reservoir is performed by opening and closing the reservoir floodgates determining the optimal operation rules of the reservoir system consisting of fully opened floodgates according to time taking into account the discharge characteristics of the gate controlled reservoirs during the flood period was an important demand raised by many reservoir managers this paper introduces a novel optimization method based on the pso algorithm combined with the rearrangement method of the particle solution groups to directly determine the optimal operation rules of the reservoir system which consists of the number of fully opened floodgates according to time when applying the pso algorithm unlike previous research that uses the discharge flow process as decision variables in this paper the pso algorithm which uses the operating plan of floodgates as the decision variables is employed to determine the initial solution for the minimal flood peak discharge in the downstream this initial solution is modified as a more reliable and realistic optimal operation rule of the reservoir that simultaneously satisfies the maximum flood peak elimination condition and the minimum operation of reservoir floodgates by the newly developed rearrangement method of partial solution groups to validate the proposed method in this paper two reservoirs placed in the upstream of chongchen river and its tributary in the dpr of korea are selected as a case study in addition the pso algorithm and progressive optimality algorithm poa which use the discharge flow process as the decision variables were conducted to compare the performance with the newly proposed method the validation results show that the method proposed in the paper is superior to the two methods and sufficiently reflects the demand of reservoir managers which can be effectively applied to the determination of the optimal operating rule of the gate controlled reservoirs during the flooding period keywords pso algorithm flood control reservoir system optimization gate controlled reservoir discharge flow 1 introduction the reservoir constructed in upstream of a river is very effective engineering structures that provide physical storage to redistribute the flow in time and space and play a great role in flood control of the river the optimal operation of the reservoir system is most one of effective methods to reduce flood damage in the downstream of the river over the past decades many researchers have published excellent research results on this issue in the early stage of these researches optimization methods such as linear programming lp needham et al 2000 nonlinear programming nlp unver and mays 1990 and dynamic programming dp hall et al 1968 simonovic and savic 1989 nagesh kumar et al 2009 jia et al 2015 have been used to reflect dynamic and nonlinear characteristics of the optimal operation problems for the reservoir however these methods have a weakness that with increasing complexity their performance was not universal and the algorithms are very complex for instance the main limitation of dp is the discretization of state variables which lead to the difficulty named the curse of dimensionality to deal with the dimensionality problems modified dp algorithms such as discrete differential dynamic programming dddp heidari et al 1971 dynamic programming successive approximation dpsa opan 2010 and the progressive optimality algorithm poa have been widely to determine the optimal solution liu et al 2011 feng et al 2018 to deal with the curse of dimensionality for the large scale reservoir systems he et al 2019 proposed a novel method called importance sampling pdp is pdp algorithm in which the merits of pdp parallel dynamic programming are integrated with importance sampling and successive approximation strategy the is pdp method was tested to optimize hydropower output for the joint operation of an 11 reservoir system located in the upper yangtze river basin of china after establishing impoundment operation by advancing impoundment timings and rising water levels as seen above attempts to improve the performance of the traditional optimization methods and apply them to the operation problems of reservoir systems continue to this day current research is mostly focused on heuristic algorithms for solving optimal operation problem of the reservoir such as particle swarm optimization pso kennedy and eberhart 1995 artificial neural networks ann neelakantan and pundarikanthan 2000 hasebe and nagayama 2002 fuzzy method cheng and chau 2001 fu 2008 genetic algorithms ga holland 1992 chang et al 2005 chang 2008 and ant colony optimization aco dorigo et al 1999 peng et al 2010 especially the particle swarm optimization method which was introduced firstly in 1995 is very excellent in principle and simple for performance and has a fast speed in convergence therefore this algorithm has been widely used in research fields including the optimal operation of reservoir flood control bayat et al 2011 ji et al 2010 mousavi and shourian 2010 however the standard particle swarm optimization has some weakness of easy to get into the local optimum and not so powerful for global search ability in order to overcome these shortcomings many improved particle swarm optimization methods have been presented parsopoulos and vrahatis 2002 peng et al 2011 moeini and babaei 2017 he et al 2014 proposed a chaotic particle swarm optimization cpso algorithm based on the improved logistic map which uses the discharge flow process as the decision variables combined with the death penalty function the performance result of the model and method in two typical floods of three gorges reservoir shows that this model can generate better solutions with minimal flood peak discharge and the maximal peak clipping rate for reservoir flood control operation jia et al 2013 presented a knowledge based cooperative particle swarm optimization kcpso that is a novel hybrid algorithm with clear structure high stability and some limitations in their research the time varying threshold factor tvtf is used to replace the standard algorithm constant threshold factor and the result shows that the use of this factor can effectively balance local cooperative and global search behavior in each evolution period and therefore increase the convergence rate of the optimal solution the common aspects in most of the aforementioned research methods to apply particle swarm optimization algorithm in the flood control operation of the reservoir system are that those researches have focused on improving searching speed and the stability of the solution by strengthening the global search ability to easily escape from the local optima and in their research decision variables to optimize are the discharge flow process for example in the case of using the pso algorithm in the first step the discharge flow process that satisfies several constraints are set randomly and the optimal discharge flow process is obtained through an iterative simulation of updating the position of the particles using the fitness function in the democratic people s republic of korea extensive research is underway to develop a more improved and more advanced optimal operation rule of the reservoir system by using various intelligent optimization algorithms such as the pso algorithm many reservoir managers suggested creative opinions that they experienced while actually managing the reservoirs during the flood period they demanded a more practical optimal operation rule of the reservoir consisting of the opened floodgates according to time taking into account the discharge characteristics of the gate controlled reservoir the optimal solution determined by previously developed reservoir operation models was the optimal discharge flow process of the reservoir in many cases this optimal discharge plan is theoretically possible but there are certain difficulties in realizing it when considering the operating characteristics of the reservoir floodgates specifically in order to realize the discharge flow process through the floodgates reservoir managers must inevitably perform the recalculation to match the optimal discharge plan with the operating conditions for reservoir floodgates in addition they raised the demand that to ensure the safety of the reservoir floodgates during the flooding period the optimal operation rules of the reservoirs should include only the number of fully opened floodgates and partial opening of the floodgate is not permitted actually the discharge flow process determined by using previous models is difficult to realize with the operating rule of the reservoir consisting of the number of fully opened floodgates according to time in this paper we introduce a novel optimization algorithm that reflects the actual operating characteristics of gate controlled reservoirs outperforms the previous traditional optimization methods for reservoir flood control this method proposed in our study combines the pso algorithm and the rearrangement method of the partial solution groups in contrast to previous studies that use the discharge flow process as decision variables when applying the pso algorithm in the proposed method the operation rules of the reservoir consisting of the number of fully opened floodgates are used as decision variables the unique advantage of this algorithm is that it realizes the intelligent optimization characteristics of the pso algorithm and greatly expands the search range to find the optimal solution and at the same time determine the more practical reservoir operation rules required for convenience the pso algorithm that uses the discharge flow process as decision variables is called the pso q algorithm and the pso algorithm that uses the operation rule of reservoir floodgates as decision variables is called the pso gn algorithm in this paper in order to overcome the weakness of the pso gn algorithm which produces different operation rules of reservoir floodgates with the same minimum flood peak discharge in the downstream the rearrangement method of the partial solution groups rmpsg method is newly developed in the paper in the rmpsg method the partial solution groups in the initial solution determined by the pso gn algorithm are sequentially combined and re evaluated to generate the most continuous and stable global optimal solution the optimal operation rules for the reservoir system which was finally determined by the combination of the two methods and satisfies conditions of the maximum flood peak elimination and the minimum operation of floodgates and sufficiently reflects the demands of reservoir managers to validate the proposed method in this paper the huichon reservoir and jangsu reservoir located in the upstream of the chongchen river in the dpr of korea is selected as a case study in addition the pso q algorithm and the progressive optimization algorithm poa which use the discharge flow process as the decision variables were conducted to compare the performance with the newly proposed method this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the flood control operation model for the reservoir system in section 3 the newly proposed methods are described in detail the case study results of the proposed method are presented through a flood event on the chongchen river of the democratic people s republic dpr of korea in section 4 finally some conclusions of our research are provided in section 5 2 flood control operation model of the reservoir

area the chongchen river possessing a length of 220 km and drainage area of about 9550 k m 2 is one of the long rivers in the middle area of the dpr of korea many tributaries flow into the chongchen river with an annual rainfall of 1000 1400 mm which is known as one of the heaviest rainfall regions of the dpr of korea especially in the anju area which is located downstream of the river the width of the river reaches about 1000 m during the flood period many large and small reservoirs have been built on the mainstream and tributaries of the chongchen river to prevent flood damage and to use the river s water resources to ensure power generation and agricultural water fig 2 shows the location of two large reservoirs that play a decisive role in flood control of the chongchen river located in the mainstream of chongchon river huichon reservoir takes on the important task of supplying water and electricity in huichun city and plays an important role in controlling the floods in the downstream in addition the jangsu reservoir located on the tributary of the chongchon river plays an indispensable role in reducing the risk of downstream flooding by effectively controlling the floods occurring at the tributaries 3 2 pso gn algorithm particle swarm optimization pso is a population based optimization technique based on swarm intelligence first introduced by eberhart and dr kennedy in 1995 inspired by the food hunting behaviors of a flock of birds a particle swarm optimization algorithm makes each particle in the population follow the current superior particle by a certain speed search optimal solution in the solution area let x and v denote a particle position and its corresponding flight velocity based on the search behavior of swarm m particles x x 1 x 2 x m t in a d dimensional search space v i v i 1 v i 2 v id also denote the velocity of i th particle x i x i 1 x i 2 x id indicates the position of the i th particle of population and p i p i 1 p i 2 p id represents the best position of the i th particle the global best position among all the particles is represented as p g p g 1 p g 2 p gd the updates of velocity and position of the i th particle can be shown according to the following simple formulas 7 v i k 1 w k v i k a 1 r n d 1 p i k x i k a 2 r n d 2 p g k x i k 8 x i k 1 x i k v i k 1 i 1 2 m j 1 2 d k 0 1 k max where v i k particle flying

al 2016 in the foregoing studies that use pso algorithm in the model of flood control operation of the reservoir system discharge flow process were regarded as decision variables x i k q i k i 1 m in our research the operation rule of reservoir floodgates according to time are directly selected as decision variables x i k g n i k i 1 m the procedure of pso gn algorithm can be summarized as follows step1 determine the value of g n i u p at each reservoir i reservoir number in this step the objective function and the constrained conditions are set as follows 10 f min g n i u p max z i t z i max g n i u p g n i a l l first of all the value of g n i u p is initially set as g n i u p 1 and then the number of fully opened floodgates according to time are set as the value of g n i u p calculate the discharge flow process of the reservoir using eq 2 during the flood period if the value of max z i t is higher than the maximum limit of inside water level z i max increase the value of g n i u p and reset operation rule of floodgates repeat calculation of discharge flow process of the reservoir using eq 2 until the above introduced condition is satisfied step2 the operation rule of floodgates g n

the operation rule of floodgates and eq 2 if the calculated discharge flow process satisfies all of the constrained conditions the solution is feasible or else the solution is infeasible if the solution is infeasible the values of g n t are modified until satisfy the constrained conditions calculate the maximum values of the discharge process in downstream of the reservoir system corresponding m particles step4 update the velocity and position of all particles using eqs 7 and 8 and evaluate the discharge flow process at each reservoir again and then record the individual minimum flood peak discharge f pi the global minimum flood peak discharge f pg the individual optimal position p i and global optimal position p g step5 if k k max then k k 1 and go back to step3 otherwise the calculation is terminated the global optimal solution generated through the search process from step 1 to step 5 is the initial operation rule of reservoir floodgates that provides the minimum flood peak discharge in the downstream 3 3 rmpsg method rmpsg method is based on the principle of consolidation and reassessment of individual partial solution groups and uses an iterative method rmpsg method combines as many individual partial solution groups as possible to make more continuous solution groups that provide the minimum downstream flood peak discharge of the same value as using the pso gn algorithm this method is mathematically modeled as follows objective function minimization of the number of partial solution groups 12 f min m m the number of partial solution groups constrained conditions 1 the downstream minimum flood peak discharge calculated by the rearranged solution should not exceed the already calculated minimum flood peak discharge using pso gn algorithm 13 q max d n rn q max d n pso q max d n rn downstream minimum flood peak discharge calculated by the rearranged solution q max d n pso downstream minimum flood peak discharge calculated by pso gn algorithm 2 the maximum reservoir water level calculated with the rearranged solution should not exceed the value of z i max 14 z i max rn z i max z i max rn the maximum reservoir water level calculated with the rearranged solution for example assume that the operation rule of a reservoir generated in the form shown in fig 3 using the pso gn algorithm contains m partial solution groups in this case the maximum number of reservoir floodgates opened during the flood control period is two g n up 2 and the procedure of rmpsg method can be summarized as follows step1 create an array variable consisting of partial solution groups with one or more fully opened floodgates the array variable consisting of partial solution groups is expressed as eq 15 15 p g p s i i 1 m 1 min g n i k 1 i 1 m 1 1 k 1 n i where p s i a structure variable that express one partial solution group m 1 the number of partial solution groups n i the number of solutions of the i th partial solution group g n i k the value of the k th solution at the i th partial solution group and reflects the number of fully opened floodgates the structure variable representing one partial solution group p s i is as follows the structure of variable p s i integer g n n i the number of fully opened floodgates in a solution integer n s i the start number of a partial solution group integer n e i the end number of a partial solution group integer n u i n e i n s i 1 n i the number of solutions of a partial solution group also the general form of a partial solution group can be expressed as eq 16 16 p s i g n i 1 g n i 2 g n i n i n s i n e i n u i n i for instance suppose the form of an initial solution that reflects the operation of reservoir floodgates created using the pso gn algorithm is shown in fig 4 an array variable of partial solution groups with one or more fully opened flood gates is represented as 17 p g p s 1 p s 2 p s 3 p s 4 p s 1 1 1 1 1 n s 0 n e 5 n u 1 4 p s 2 1 2 1 1 1 n s 5 n e 11 n u

other partial solution group and join the two solution groups to form one large partial solution group referring to fig 4 let s describe the join process of two partial solution groups among the partial solution groups shown in fig 4 the partial solution groups that can be combined in step 2 are p s 1 and p s 2 the new partial solution group created by combining these two partial solution groups will have the form shown in fig 5 the combine condition and result of partial solution groups p s 1 and p s 2 are expressed by eqs 18 and 19 18 p s 1 1 1 1 1 n s 1 0 n e 1 5 n u 1 4 p s 2 1 2 1

partial solution groups in step 2 are represented by eqs 20 and 21 20 p s k g n k 1 g n k 2 g n k n k n s k n e k n u k n k p s k 1 g n k 1 1 g n k 1 2 g n k 1 n k 1 n s k 1 n e k 1 n u k 1 n k 1 n e

solution groups are rearranged and the rearranged solution is expressed as eq 22 22 p g p s 1 p s 2 p s k p s m 1 1 p s k p s k p s k 1 recalculate the discharge flow process at each reservoir using eq 2 under the new operation rule of reservoir floodgates generated by rearranging the partial solution groups if the calculated minimum flood peak discharge f g is less than or equal to the initial minimum flood peak discharge f g then the updated array of partial solution groups p g can be considered as the new global optimal solution p g otherwise p g is removed if f g f g in this way the combination and rearrangement of the two partial solution groups among m 1 partial solution groups proceeds as far as possible step3 among the updated partial solution groups select and combine two different partial solution groups that meet the combine condition to form one large partial solution group as shown in fig 6 select the leftmost partial solution group on the time axis and then combine with the other partial solution groups in turn when combining two partial solution groups the leftmost group can be combined with other groups in two ways that is the other partial solution group can be combined to the left and right side of the leftmost group the general form of the new group obtained after combining two different partial solution groups in step 3 are represented by eqs 23 and 24 23 p s k l p s k p s k 1 g n k 1 g n k n k g n k 1 1 g n k 1 n k 1 n s k n s k n e k n e k n k 1 2 n u k n k n k 1 1 24 p s k r p s k 1 p s k g n k 1 1 g n k 1 n k 1 g n k 1 g n k n k n s k

are successfully combined the array of partial solution groups is rearranged and the leftmost group is selected again from the updated array otherwise if all combinations between the leftmost group and the other group fail the partial solution group on the right side closest to the leftmost group is selected as the new leftmost group and then combined with the other partial solution groups on the right for convenience in the description the rearrangement process of the partial solution groups in step 2 and step 3 is called the first level rearrangement process fig 7 shows the global optimal solution generated by the combination and rearrangement of the partial solution groups in step2 and step3 step4 in the modified solution create array variables that contain partial solution groups consisting of two or more fully opened floodgates 25 p g p g 1 p g 2 p g m 2 p gi p s i 1 p s i 2 p s i s i p s ij g n ij 1 g n ij 2 g n ij n ij n s ij n e ij n u ij n ij min g n ij k 2 i 1 m 2

partial solution groups and two partial solution groups and these two array variables are expressed as eqs 23 and 24 combination and rearrangement between the two partial solution groups go through steps 2 and 3 within the scope of the array to which they belong the final result of the combination and rearrangement of the partial solution groups in step 4 is shown in fig 9 the rearrangement process of the partial solution groups in step 4 is called the second level rearrangement process step5 if there are partial solution groups with more than three fully opened floodgates repeat the combination and rearrangement of partial solution groups as in step 4 otherwise the simulation is terminated in this way the global optimal solution determined through the combination and rearrangement of the partial solution groups from step 2 to step 5 provides the optimal operation rule of the reservoir floodgates and the minimum flood peak discharge in the downstream the rearrangement process of the partial solution groups in step 5 is called the third level rearrangement process fig 10 shows the flowchart of the generalized rmpsg method when the value of g n up is greater than one g n up 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 simulation results for proposed method the flood that occurred in the chongchen river basin in july 2016 was used as the case study on the

results for the huichon and jangsu reservoirs obtained using the method proposed in the paper the initial discharge flow processes and operation rules for the two reservoirs generated by applying the pso gn algorithm are shown in figs 11 and 12 unfortunately these discharge flow processes are seeing blade shaped and the operation rules of two reservoir floodgates are very complex the operation rules and discharge flow processes of two reservoirs determined through the first level rearrangement process are shown in figs 13 and 14 in the first level rearrangement process many partial solution groups with one or more fully open floodgates were combined to create a more continuous operation rule of reservoir floodgates figs 15 and 16 shows the discharge flow processes of two reservoirs

process of the operation rules of the two reservoirs through the step by step rearrangement of partial solution groups is listed in table 3 the finally determined operation rules of the reservoir system provide the minimum flood peak discharge in the downstream as well as the minimum operation of the reservoir floodgates the total calculation time required for the flood control simulation is 21 s and more than 95 of the total calculation time is spent in the simulation to create the initial optimal operation planning by the pso gn algorithm 4 2 performance evaluation of pso gn algorithm and rmpsg method the same simulation was repeated several times to evaluate the performance of the proposed pso gn algorithm and rmpsg method in each simulation model parameters and boundary conditions are set identically fig 19 shows the results of the discharge flow process and the operation rule of a reservoir generated by applying the pso gn algorithm although the initial boundary conditions and basic parameters of the pso gn algorithm are all set to be the same the operation rules of the reservoir floodgates generated are different however in each simulation the rules of operation of the reservoir floodgate generated by the pso gn algorithm have the following common features first the time distribution trends of intensive discharge flow and discharge flow limits are almost the same in each operation rule of the reservoir second the total discharge time and discharge volume are almost the same in each operation rule of the reservoir also it should be noted that the flood peak discharge flow in the downstream is determined identically in each simulation in short when the pso gn algorithm is applied independently the purpose of minimizing the downstream flood peak can be realized however the rules of operation of the reservoir floodgates to ensure that are obtained differently in each simulation and are also very complicated so it is impossible to apply them to actual flood control operations fig 20 shows the process of generating stable and common operation rules of floodgates by applying the rmpsg method as you can see the initial solutions determined by the pso gn algorithm are different but as a result of applying the rmpsg method one common solution the operation rule of reservoir floodgates is obtained through experiments we found that rmpsg method synthesizes partial solution groups determined in different forms producing a stable final solution when the initially obtained partial solution groups have the above mentioned three properties in the paper the proposed model pso q algorithm and progressive optimization algorithm poa were used to determine the optimal operation rules for flood control of the two reservoirs and the effects of these three methods were compared evaluation indicators include minimum flood peak discharge in the downstream the feasibility of reservoir operation rule by fully opened floodgates computation time and maximum controlled discharge of the reservoir 4 3 comparison with pso q algorithm the objective function constraints and procedure of the pso q algorithm he et al 2014 are presented in the appendix a the values of the main parameters of the pso q algorithm are shown in table 4 figs 21 and 22 show the comparison results of the discharge flow process generated by applying the pso q and newly proposed methods to the flood control simulation of huichon reservoir and jangsu reservoir in the case of using the pso q algorithm the discharge flow process of each reservoir is almost constant over time and the maximum controlled discharges are less than the proposed method but the minimum flood peak discharge in the downstream is much larger than the proposed method table 5 from the standpoint of maximum eliminating flood peak in the downstream the proposed method is clearly superior to the pso q algorithm as can be seen intuitively in figs 21 and 22 the discharge flow process determined by the pso q algorithm is very difficult to realize with the operation rule of the reservoir consisting of the number of fully opened floodgates according to the time the experiments were conducted to compare the search performance and convergence of the two algorithms for each algorithm we set the same number of calculation iterations k max 500 and set the different numbers of particles m 100 200 300 500 to perform the optimal value search experiment in the fig 23 the pso gn algorithm has a larger amplitude than the pso q algorithm in the search range of the optimal value and converges to a better optimal value in other words it can be intuitively understood that the pso gn algorithm is superior to the pso q algorithm for minimizing flood peak discharge in the downstream in fact looking at the process of generating decision variables in the pso gn algorithm in the first step the integers from 0 to gn up are randomly generated and the integer series corresponding to one particle reflects the operation rule of the reservoir floodgates during the period of flood control for instance if the value of gn up is set to 3 the integer value that will be taken randomly will be 0 1 2 and 3 and the probability that the value will be selected as zero will be on average 0 25 eventually in the generated discharge flow series there are more decision variables whose values are completely zero than the pso q algorithm the evolution of particle positions makes the distinction between the concentrated discharge zone and the discharge restricted zone in the operating plan of the reservoir clear also as flood peak discharge at the downstream converges to optimal value the operating plan to reduce the discharge flow through the flood gates to the minimum when the maximum inflow reaches the reservoir area is continuously updated it is noteworthy that even if based on the same pso theory the intelligence search performance of the pso gn algorithm is far superior to the pso q algorithm when the particle is set to the number of fully opened floodgates over time therefore in terms of minimizing the downstream flood peak the pso gn algorithm can find a smaller optimal value than the pso q algorithm however it is inevitable that the complex discharge flow process in the form of a saw blade in each reservoir is determined by the influence of random integer generation in combination with the rmpsg method this deficiency is overcome and a very stable and reasonable reservoir operation rule is finally determined thus it is possible to provide superior results compared to the pso q algorithm 4 4 comparison with poa progressive optimality algorithm in the paper the well known poa zhang et al 2015 was used to conduct the flood control simulation to compare with the proposed method the objective function constraints and procedure of the poa is presented in the appendix b in this comparative experiment a flood event that occurred in september 2014 was selected as a case study the main parameters of poa are shown in table 6 figs 24 and 25 shows the comparison of optimal discharge flow processes of the reservoirs determined by two methods from figs 24 and 25 and table 7 it can be seen that although the maximum controlled discharge from the reservoir determined by the poa is smaller than the proposed method the minimum flood peak discharge in the downstream is much larger than that in the proposed method as can be seen in fig 25 the optimal discharge flow process determined by the poa is difficult to switch directly to the operating rule of a reservoir consisting of fully opened floodgates according to time in other words to match the discharge flow of the reservoir of each time step some floodgates must be fully opened and other floodgates must be partially opened this discharge flow process does not meet the demands raised by reservoir managers furthermore the total simulation time is much shorter than the poa when using the proposed method in the poa the reservoir water level is discrete into δ z intervals from the minimal water level to the maximal level for flood control in order to compose all the possible water level states and then the recursive calculation is performed for all possible state of water levels at each time stage of the simulation for instance if the value of δ z is set to 0 001 as shown in table 6 it is necessary to carry out over 10 000 iteration calculations for each time stage of simulation in addition approximately 1 650 000 or more recursion calculations should be conducted to complete the overall first simulation meanwhile in the pso gn algorithm if the number of particles is set to 100 and the number of iterations to 500 approximately 50 000 iteration calculations are required for the entire simulation 5 conclusion in this paper a new optimization algorithm for flood control of the reservoir system based on the pso gn algorithm combined with rmpsg method is proposed and its performance is compared with that of the pso q algorithm and poa the following conclusions could be drawn from this study 1 the proposed method provides more practical and convenient operation rules of the reservoir system for reservoir managers compared to the traditional optimization methods already developed using the proposed method the optimal operation rules of the reservoirs consisting of the fully opened floodgates according to time is directly determined the pso gn algorithm which uses a group of particles consisting of random integer arrays from 0 to gn has a much broader search range than the pso q algorithm and shows excellent search capability for objective value compared to other algorithms used in the paper the rmpsg method recombines and evaluates partial solution groups in the initial solution determined by the pso gn algorithm and finally produces a stable and reasonable global optimal solution with continuous discharge time this method of determining the final solution through the combination of the pso gn algorithm that amplifies the intelligent optimization characteristics of the pso algorithm and the rmpsg method that wittily recombines partial solution groups constituting the initial solution is theoretically superior to other existing algorithms and practically satisfies the demands of reservoir managers 2 the effectiveness and superiority of the method proposed in the paper were confirmed through comparative simulations for flood control of the chongchen river although the maximum controlled discharge from the reservoir is larger than the compared methods the minimum flood peak discharge in the downstream was the smallest compared to the other two methods when applying the proposed method in the flood event in august 2016 the flood peak discharge at the downstream protection place is 8994 m 3 s reducing 40 28 of the expected natural flood peak inflow on the other hand when using the pso q algorithm flood peak reduction rate at the downstream protection place is 28 81 in the flood event in september 2014 the flood peak discharge at the downstream protection place is 7201 m 3 s by the proposed method reducing 41 98 of the expected natural flood peak inflow meanwhile when applying the poa flood peak reduction rate at the downstream protection place is 31 62 furthermore the total computation time of the simulation is much faster compared to poa when using the proposed method by employing the proposed method in the two flood events used as a case study the average simulation time is 27 5 s which is very short compared to the poa 115 s and shows the advantage of the intelligent optimization method although the proposed method is efficient for the optimal operation of the gate controlled reservoir system the performance comparison with other optimization methods for the complex reservoir system has not been conducted further research is needed to determine the optimal operation of the gate controlled reservoir consisting of fully and partially opened floodgates according to time to extend the practicality of this method credit authorship contribution statement yong gun kim

with the assistance of baptiste françois associate editor the discharge flow process for flood control of a gate controlled reservoir is performed by opening and closing the reservoir floodgates determining the optimal operation rules of the reservoir system consisting of fully opened floodgates according to time taking into account the discharge characteristics of the gate controlled reservoirs during the flood period was an important demand raised by many reservoir managers this paper introduces a novel optimization method based on the pso algorithm combined with the rearrangement method of the particle solution groups to directly determine the optimal operation rules of the reservoir system which consists of the number of fully opened floodgates according to time when applying the pso algorithm unlike previous research that uses the discharge flow process as decision variables in this paper the pso algorithm which uses the operating plan of floodgates as the decision variables is employed to determine the initial solution for the minimal flood peak discharge in the downstream this initial solution is modified as a more reliable and realistic optimal operation rule of the reservoir that simultaneously satisfies the maximum flood peak elimination condition and the minimum operation of reservoir floodgates by the newly developed rearrangement method of partial solution groups to validate the proposed method in this paper two reservoirs placed in the upstream of chongchen river and its tributary in the dpr of korea are selected as a case study in addition the pso algorithm and progressive optimality algorithm poa which use the discharge flow process as the decision variables were conducted to compare the performance with the newly proposed method the validation results show that the method proposed in the paper is superior to the two methods and sufficiently reflects the demand of reservoir managers which can be effectively applied to the determination of the optimal operating rule of the gate controlled reservoirs during the flooding period keywords pso algorithm flood control reservoir system optimization gate controlled reservoir discharge flow 1 introduction the reservoir constructed in upstream of a river is very effective engineering structures that provide physical storage to redistribute the flow in time and space and play a great role in flood control of the river the optimal operation of the reservoir system is most one of effective methods to reduce flood damage in the downstream of the river over the past decades many researchers have published excellent research results on this issue in the early stage of these researches optimization methods such as linear programming lp needham et al 2000 nonlinear programming nlp unver and mays 1990 and dynamic programming dp hall et al 1968 simonovic and savic 1989 nagesh kumar et al 2009 jia et al 2015 have been used to reflect dynamic and nonlinear characteristics of the optimal operation problems for the reservoir however these methods have a weakness that with increasing complexity their performance was not universal and the algorithms are very complex for instance the main limitation of dp is the discretization of state variables which lead to the difficulty named the curse of dimensionality to deal with the dimensionality problems modified dp algorithms such as discrete differential dynamic programming dddp heidari et al 1971 dynamic programming successive approximation dpsa opan 2010 and the progressive optimality algorithm poa have been widely to determine the optimal solution liu et al 2011 feng et al 2018 to deal with the curse of dimensionality for the large scale reservoir systems he et al 2019 proposed a novel method called importance sampling pdp is pdp algorithm in which the merits of pdp parallel dynamic programming are integrated with importance sampling and successive approximation strategy the is pdp method was tested to optimize hydropower output for the joint operation of an 11 reservoir system located in the upper yangtze river basin of china after establishing impoundment operation by advancing impoundment timings and rising water levels as seen above attempts to improve the performance of the traditional optimization methods and apply them to the operation problems of reservoir systems continue to this day current research is mostly focused on heuristic algorithms for solving optimal operation problem of the reservoir such as particle swarm optimization pso kennedy and eberhart 1995 artificial neural networks ann neelakantan and pundarikanthan 2000 hasebe and nagayama 2002 fuzzy method cheng and chau 2001 fu 2008 genetic algorithms ga holland 1992 chang et al 2005 chang 2008 and ant colony optimization aco dorigo et al 1999 peng et al 2010 especially the particle swarm optimization method which was introduced firstly in 1995 is very excellent in principle and simple for performance and has a fast speed in convergence therefore this algorithm has been widely used in research fields including the optimal operation of reservoir flood control bayat et al 2011 ji et al 2010 mousavi and shourian 2010 however the standard particle swarm optimization has some weakness of easy to get into the local optimum and not so powerful for global search ability in order to overcome these shortcomings many improved particle swarm optimization methods have been presented parsopoulos and vrahatis 2002 peng et al 2011 moeini and babaei 2017 he et al 2014 proposed a chaotic particle swarm optimization cpso algorithm based on the improved logistic map which uses the discharge flow process as the decision variables combined with the death penalty function the performance result of the model and method in two typical floods of three gorges reservoir shows that this model can generate better solutions with minimal flood peak discharge and the maximal peak clipping rate for reservoir flood control operation jia et al 2013 presented a knowledge based cooperative particle swarm optimization kcpso that is a novel hybrid algorithm with clear structure high stability and some limitations in their research the time varying threshold factor tvtf is used to replace the standard algorithm constant threshold factor and the result shows that the use of this factor can effectively balance local cooperative and global search behavior in each evolution period and therefore increase the convergence rate of the optimal solution the common aspects in most of the aforementioned research methods to apply particle swarm optimization algorithm in the flood control operation of the reservoir system are that those researches have focused on improving searching speed and the stability of the solution by strengthening the global search ability to easily escape from the local optima and in their research decision variables to optimize are the discharge flow process for example in the case of using the pso algorithm in the first step the discharge flow process that satisfies several constraints are set randomly and the optimal discharge flow process is obtained through an iterative simulation of updating the position of the particles using the fitness function in the democratic people s republic of korea extensive research is underway to develop a more improved and more advanced optimal operation rule of the reservoir system by using various intelligent optimization algorithms such as the pso algorithm many reservoir managers suggested creative opinions that they experienced while actually managing the reservoirs during the flood period they demanded a more practical optimal operation rule of the reservoir consisting of the opened floodgates according to time taking into account the discharge characteristics of the gate controlled reservoir the optimal solution determined by previously developed reservoir operation models was the optimal discharge flow process of the reservoir in many cases this optimal discharge plan is theoretically possible but there are certain difficulties in realizing it when considering the operating characteristics of the reservoir floodgates specifically in order to realize the discharge flow process through the floodgates reservoir managers must inevitably perform the recalculation to match the optimal discharge plan with the operating conditions for reservoir floodgates in addition they raised the demand that to ensure the safety of the reservoir floodgates during the flooding period the optimal operation rules of the reservoirs should include only the number of fully opened floodgates and partial opening of the floodgate is not permitted actually the discharge flow process determined by using previous models is difficult to realize with the operating rule of the reservoir consisting of the number of fully opened floodgates according to time in this paper we introduce a novel optimization algorithm that reflects the actual operating characteristics of gate controlled reservoirs outperforms the previous traditional optimization methods for reservoir flood control this method proposed in our study combines the pso algorithm and the rearrangement method of the partial solution groups in contrast to previous studies that use the discharge flow process as decision variables when applying the pso algorithm in the proposed method the operation rules of the reservoir consisting of the number of fully opened floodgates are used as decision variables the unique advantage of this algorithm is that it realizes the intelligent optimization characteristics of the pso algorithm and greatly expands the search range to find the optimal solution and at the same time determine the more practical reservoir operation rules required for convenience the pso algorithm that uses the discharge flow process as decision variables is called the pso q algorithm and the pso algorithm that uses the operation rule of reservoir floodgates as decision variables is called the pso gn algorithm in this paper in order to overcome the weakness of the pso gn algorithm which produces different operation rules of reservoir floodgates with the same minimum flood peak discharge in the downstream the rearrangement method of the partial solution groups rmpsg method is newly developed in the paper in the rmpsg method the partial solution groups in the initial solution determined by the pso gn algorithm are sequentially combined and re evaluated to generate the most continuous and stable global optimal solution the optimal operation rules for the reservoir system which was finally determined by the combination of the two methods and satisfies conditions of the maximum flood peak elimination and the minimum operation of floodgates and sufficiently reflects the demands of reservoir managers to validate the proposed method in this paper the huichon reservoir and jangsu reservoir located in the upstream of the chongchen river in the dpr of korea is selected as a case study in addition the pso q algorithm and the progressive optimization algorithm poa which use the discharge flow process as the decision variables were conducted to compare the performance with the newly proposed method this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the flood control operation model for the reservoir system in section 3 the newly proposed methods are described in detail the case study results of the proposed method are presented through a flood event on the chongchen river of the democratic people s republic dpr of korea in section 4 finally some conclusions of our research are provided in section 5 2 flood control operation model of the reservoir

area the chongchen river possessing a length of 220 km and drainage area of about 9550 k m 2 is one of the long rivers in the middle area of the dpr of korea many tributaries flow into the chongchen river with an annual rainfall of 1000 1400 mm which is known as one of the heaviest rainfall regions of the dpr of korea especially in the anju area which is located downstream of the river the width of the river reaches about 1000 m during the flood period many large and small reservoirs have been built on the mainstream and tributaries of the chongchen river to prevent flood damage and to use the river s water resources to ensure power generation and agricultural water fig 2 shows the location of two large reservoirs that play a decisive role in flood control of the chongchen river located in the mainstream of chongchon river huichon reservoir takes on the important task of supplying water and electricity in huichun city and plays an important role in controlling the floods in the downstream in addition the jangsu reservoir located on the tributary of the chongchon river plays an indispensable role in reducing the risk of downstream flooding by effectively controlling the floods occurring at the tributaries 3 2 pso gn algorithm particle swarm optimization pso is a population based optimization technique based on swarm intelligence first introduced by eberhart and dr kennedy in 1995 inspired by the food hunting behaviors of a flock of birds a particle swarm optimization algorithm makes each particle in the population follow the current superior particle by a certain speed search optimal solution in the solution area let x and v denote a particle position and its corresponding flight velocity based on the search behavior of swarm m particles x x 1 x 2 x m

represents the best position of the i th particle the global best position among all the particles is represented as p g p g 1 p g 2 p gd the updates of velocity and position of the i th particle can be shown according to the following simple formulas 7 v i k 1 w k v i k a 1 r n d 1 p i k x i k a 2 r n d 2 p g k x i k 8 x i k 1 x i k v i k 1 i 1 2 m j 1 2 d k 0 1 k max where v i k particle flying

al 2016 in the foregoing studies that use pso algorithm in the model of flood control operation of the reservoir system discharge flow process were regarded as decision variables x i k q i k i 1 m in our research the operation rule of reservoir floodgates according to time are directly selected as decision variables x i k g n i k i 1 m the procedure of pso gn algorithm can be summarized as follows step1 determine the value of g n i u p at each reservoir i reservoir number in this step the objective function and the constrained conditions are set as follows 10 f min g n i u p max z i t z i max g n i u p g n i a l l first of all the value of g n i u p is initially set as g n i u p 1 and then the number of fully opened floodgates according to time are set as the value of g n i u p calculate the discharge flow process of the reservoir using eq 2 during the flood period if the value of max z i t is higher than the maximum limit of inside water level z i max increase the value of g n i u p and reset operation rule of floodgates repeat calculation of discharge flow process of the reservoir using eq 2 until the above introduced condition is satisfied step2 the operation rule of floodgates g n

the operation rule of floodgates and eq 2 if the calculated discharge flow process satisfies all of the constrained conditions the solution is feasible or else the solution is infeasible if the solution is infeasible the values of g n t are modified until satisfy the constrained conditions calculate the maximum values of the discharge process in downstream of the reservoir system corresponding m particles step4 update the velocity and position of all particles using eqs 7 and 8 and evaluate the discharge flow process at each reservoir again and then record the individual minimum flood peak discharge f pi the global minimum flood peak discharge f pg the individual optimal position p i and global optimal position p g step5 if k k max then k k 1 and go back to step3 otherwise the calculation is terminated the global optimal solution generated through the search process from step 1 to step 5 is the initial operation rule of reservoir floodgates that provides the minimum flood peak discharge in the downstream 3 3 rmpsg method rmpsg method is based on the principle of consolidation and reassessment of individual partial solution groups and uses an iterative method rmpsg method combines as many individual partial solution groups as possible to make more continuous solution groups that provide the minimum downstream flood peak discharge of the same value as using the pso gn algorithm this method is mathematically modeled as follows objective function minimization of the number of partial solution groups 12 f min m m the number of partial solution groups constrained conditions 1 the downstream minimum flood peak discharge calculated by the rearranged solution should not exceed the already calculated minimum flood peak discharge using pso gn algorithm 13 q max d n rn q max d n pso q max d n rn downstream minimum flood peak discharge calculated by the rearranged solution q max d n pso downstream minimum flood peak discharge calculated by pso gn algorithm 2 the maximum reservoir water level calculated with the rearranged solution should not exceed the value of z i max 14 z i max rn z i max z i max rn the maximum reservoir water level calculated with the rearranged solution for example assume that the operation rule of a reservoir generated in the form shown in fig 3 using the pso gn algorithm contains m partial solution groups in this case the maximum number of reservoir floodgates opened during the flood control period is two g n up 2 and the procedure of rmpsg method can be summarized as follows step1 create an array variable consisting of partial solution groups with one or more fully opened floodgates the array variable consisting of partial solution groups is expressed as eq 15 15 p g p s i i 1 m 1 min g n i k 1 i 1 m 1 1 k 1 n i where p s i a structure variable that express one partial solution group m 1 the number of partial solution groups n i the number of solutions of the i th partial solution group g n i k the value of the k th solution at the i th partial solution group and reflects the number of fully opened floodgates the structure variable representing one partial solution group p s i is as follows the structure of variable p s i integer g n n i the number of fully opened floodgates in a solution integer n s i the start number of a partial solution group integer n e i the end number of a partial solution group integer n u i n e i n s i 1 n i the number of solutions of a partial solution group also the general form of a partial solution group can be expressed as eq 16 16 p s i g n i 1 g n i 2 g n i n i n s i n e i n u i n i for instance suppose the form of an initial solution that reflects the operation of reservoir floodgates created using the pso gn algorithm is shown in fig 4 an array variable of partial solution groups with one or more fully opened flood gates is represented as 17 p g p s 1 p s 2 p s 3 p s 4 p s 1 1 1 1 1 n s 0 n e 5 n u 1 4 p s 2 1 2 1 1 1 n s 5 n e 11 n u

other partial solution group and join the two solution groups to form one large partial solution group referring to fig 4 let s describe the join process of two partial solution groups among the partial solution groups shown in fig 4 the partial solution groups that can be combined in step 2 are p s 1 and p s 2 the new partial solution group created by combining these two partial solution groups will have the form shown in fig 5 the combine condition and result of partial solution groups p s 1 and p s 2 are expressed by eqs 18 and 19 18 p s 1 1 1 1 1 n s 1 0 n e 1 5 n u 1 4 p s 2 1 2 1

partial solution groups in step 2 are represented by eqs 20 and 21 20 p s k g n k 1 g n k 2 g n k n k n s k n e k n u k n k p s k 1 g n k 1 1 g n k 1 2 g n k 1 n k 1 n s k 1 n e k 1 n u k 1 n k 1 n e

solution groups are rearranged and the rearranged solution is expressed as eq 22 22 p g p s 1 p s 2 p s k p s m 1 1 p s k p s k p s k 1 recalculate the discharge flow process at each reservoir using eq 2 under the new operation rule of reservoir floodgates generated by rearranging the partial solution groups if the calculated minimum flood peak discharge f g is less than or equal to the initial minimum flood peak discharge f g then the updated array of partial solution groups p g can be considered as the new global optimal solution p g otherwise p g is removed if f g f g in this way the combination and rearrangement of the two partial solution groups among m 1 partial solution groups proceeds as far as possible step3 among the updated partial solution groups select and combine two different partial solution groups that meet the combine condition to form one large partial solution group as shown in fig 6 select the leftmost partial solution group on the time axis and then combine with the other partial solution groups in turn when combining two partial solution groups the leftmost group can be combined with other groups in two ways that is the other partial solution group can be combined to the left and right side of the leftmost group the general form of the new group obtained after combining two different partial solution groups in step 3 are represented by eqs 23 and 24 23 p s k l p s k p s k 1 g n k 1 g n k n k g n k 1 1 g n k 1 n k 1 n s k n s k n e k n e k n k 1 2 n u k n k n k 1 1 24 p s k r p s k 1 p s k g n k 1 1 g n k 1 n k 1 g n k 1 g n k n k n s k 1 n s k 1 n e k 1 n e k 1 n k 2 n u k 1 n k n k 1 1 in step 3 the combinatorial evaluation criteria between two partial solution groups are the same as in step 2 when the two partial solution groups are successfully combined the array of partial solution groups is rearranged and the leftmost group is selected again from the updated array otherwise if all combinations between the leftmost group and the other group fail the partial solution group on the right side closest to the leftmost group is selected as the new leftmost group and then combined with the other partial solution groups on the right for convenience in the description the rearrangement process of the partial solution groups in step 2 and step 3 is called the first level rearrangement process fig 7 shows the global optimal solution generated by the combination and rearrangement of the partial solution groups in step2 and step3 step4 in the modified solution create array variables that contain partial solution groups consisting of two or more fully opened floodgates 25 p g p g 1 p g 2 p g m 2 p gi p s i 1 p s i 2 p s i s i p s ij g n ij 1 g n ij 2 g n ij n ij n s ij n e ij n u ij n ij min g n ij k 2 i 1 m 2 j 1 s i k 1 n ij for instance in the case of the modified solution is determined as for fig 8 the array variables of partial solution groups with more than two fully opened floodgates are expressed as follows 26 p g p g 1 p g 2 p g 1 p s 11 p s 12 p s 13 t p g 2 p s 21 p s 22 t 27 p g 1 p s 11 p s 12 p s 13 t p s 11 2 2 n s 11 1 n e 11 4 n u 11 2 p s 12 2 n s 12 5 n e 12 7 n u 12 1 p s 13 2 n s 13

partial solution groups and two partial solution groups and these two array variables are expressed as eqs 23 and 24 combination and rearrangement between the two partial solution groups go through steps 2 and 3 within the scope of the array to which they belong the final result of the combination and rearrangement of the partial solution groups in step 4 is shown in fig 9 the rearrangement process of the partial solution groups in step 4 is called the second level rearrangement process step5 if there are partial solution groups with more than three fully opened floodgates repeat the combination and rearrangement of partial solution groups as in step 4 otherwise the simulation is terminated in this way the global optimal solution determined through the combination and rearrangement of the partial solution groups from step 2 to step 5 provides the optimal operation rule of the reservoir floodgates and the minimum flood peak discharge in the downstream the rearrangement process of the partial solution groups in step 5 is called the third level rearrangement process fig 10 shows the flowchart of the generalized rmpsg method when the value of g n up is greater than one g n up 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 simulation results for proposed method the flood that occurred in the chongchen river basin in july 2016 was used as the case study on the evening of july 22 the national weather center issued a rainfall forecast of 150 200 mm partly over 250 mm and heavy rainfall in the west coastal region from the morning of the 23th that would be due to the influence of storm the inflow process of two reservoirs interval inflow process of tributaries and each river flood routing parameters are known the main operating parameters for the huichon reservoir and jangsu reservoir are shown in table 1 for the simulation of flood control of two reservoirs the calculation time step δ t 3600 s and the total calculation time t 178 h has been assigned and main parameters of pso gn algorithm to determine the initial operating plan of reservoir floodgates are shown in table2 he et al 2014 2016 figs 11 18 shows step by step the optimal flood control results for the huichon and jangsu reservoirs obtained using the method proposed in the paper the initial discharge flow processes and operation rules for the two reservoirs generated by applying the pso gn algorithm are shown in figs 11 and 12 unfortunately these discharge flow processes are seeing blade shaped and the operation rules of two reservoir floodgates are very complex the operation rules and discharge flow processes of two reservoirs determined through the first level rearrangement process are shown in figs 13 and 14 in the first level rearrangement process many partial solution groups with one or more fully open floodgates were combined to create a more continuous operation rule of reservoir floodgates figs 15 and 16 shows the discharge flow processes of two reservoirs determined through the second level rearrangement process the final optimal operation rules of two reservoirs through the third level rearrangement process are shown in figs 17 and 18 the improvement process of the operation rules of the two reservoirs through the step by step rearrangement of partial solution groups is listed in table 3 the finally determined operation rules of the reservoir system provide the minimum flood peak discharge in the downstream as well as the minimum operation of the reservoir floodgates the total calculation time required for the flood control simulation is 21 s and more than 95 of the total calculation time is spent in the simulation to create the initial optimal operation planning by the pso gn algorithm 4 2 performance evaluation of pso gn algorithm and rmpsg method the same simulation was repeated several times to evaluate the performance of the proposed pso gn algorithm and rmpsg method in each simulation model parameters and boundary conditions are set identically fig 19 shows the results of the discharge flow process and the operation rule of a reservoir generated by applying the pso gn algorithm although the initial boundary conditions and basic parameters of the pso gn algorithm are all set to be the same the operation rules of the reservoir floodgates generated are different however in each simulation the rules of operation of the reservoir floodgate generated by the pso gn algorithm have the following common features first the time distribution trends of intensive discharge flow and discharge flow limits are almost the same in each operation rule of the reservoir second the total discharge time and discharge volume are almost the same in each operation rule of the reservoir also it should be noted that the flood peak discharge flow in the downstream is determined identically in each simulation in short when the pso gn algorithm is applied independently the purpose of minimizing the downstream flood peak can be realized however the rules of operation of the reservoir floodgates to ensure that are obtained differently in each simulation and are also very complicated so it is impossible to apply them to actual flood control operations fig 20 shows the process of generating stable and common operation rules of floodgates by applying the rmpsg method as you can see the initial solutions determined by the pso gn algorithm are different but as a result of applying the rmpsg method one common solution the operation rule of reservoir floodgates is obtained through experiments we found that rmpsg method synthesizes partial solution groups determined in different forms producing a stable final solution when the initially obtained partial solution groups have the above mentioned three properties in the paper the proposed model pso q algorithm and progressive optimization algorithm poa were used to determine the optimal operation rules for flood control of the two reservoirs and the effects of these three methods were compared evaluation indicators include minimum flood peak discharge in the downstream the feasibility of reservoir operation rule by fully opened floodgates computation time and maximum controlled discharge of the reservoir 4 3 comparison with pso q algorithm the objective function constraints and procedure of the pso q algorithm he et al 2014 are presented in the appendix a the values of the main parameters of the pso q algorithm are shown in table 4 figs 21 and 22 show the comparison results of the discharge flow process generated by applying the pso q and newly proposed methods to the flood control simulation of huichon reservoir and jangsu reservoir in the case of using the pso q algorithm the discharge flow process of each reservoir is almost constant over time and the maximum controlled discharges are less than the proposed method but the minimum flood peak discharge in the downstream is much larger than the proposed method table 5 from the standpoint of maximum eliminating flood peak in the downstream the proposed method is clearly superior to the pso q algorithm as can be seen intuitively in figs 21 and 22 the discharge flow process determined by the pso q algorithm is very difficult to realize with the operation rule of the reservoir consisting of the number of fully opened floodgates according to the time the experiments were conducted to compare the search performance and convergence of the two algorithms for each algorithm we set the same number of calculation iterations k max 500 and set the different numbers of particles m 100 200 300 500 to perform the optimal value search experiment in the fig 23 the pso gn algorithm has a larger amplitude than the pso q algorithm in the search range of the optimal value and converges to a better optimal value in other words it can be intuitively understood that the pso gn algorithm is superior to the pso q algorithm for minimizing flood peak discharge in the downstream in fact looking at the process of generating decision variables in the pso gn algorithm in the first step the integers from 0 to gn up are randomly generated and the integer series corresponding to one particle reflects the operation rule of the reservoir floodgates during the period of flood control for instance if the value of gn up is set to 3 the integer value that will be taken randomly will be 0 1 2 and 3 and the probability that the value will be selected as zero will be on average 0 25 eventually in the generated discharge flow series there are more decision variables whose values are completely zero than the pso q algorithm the evolution of particle positions makes the distinction between the concentrated discharge zone and the discharge restricted zone in the operating plan of the reservoir clear also as flood peak discharge at the downstream converges to optimal value the operating plan to reduce the discharge flow through the flood gates to the minimum when the maximum inflow reaches the reservoir area is continuously updated it is noteworthy that even if based on the same pso theory the intelligence search performance of the pso gn algorithm is far superior to the pso q algorithm when the particle is set to the number of fully opened floodgates over time therefore in terms of minimizing the downstream flood peak the pso gn algorithm can find a smaller optimal value than the pso q algorithm however it is inevitable that the complex discharge flow process in the form of a saw blade in each reservoir is determined by the influence of random integer generation in combination with the rmpsg method this deficiency is overcome and a very stable and reasonable reservoir operation rule is finally determined thus it is possible to provide superior results compared to the pso q algorithm 4 4 comparison with poa progressive optimality algorithm in the paper the well known poa zhang et al 2015 was used to conduct the flood control simulation to compare with the proposed method the objective function constraints and procedure of the poa is presented in the appendix b in this comparative experiment a flood event that occurred in september 2014 was selected as a case study the main parameters of poa are shown in table 6 figs 24 and 25 shows the comparison of optimal discharge flow processes of the reservoirs determined by two methods from figs 24 and 25 and table 7 it can be seen that although the maximum controlled discharge from the reservoir determined by the poa is smaller than the proposed method the minimum flood peak discharge in the downstream is much larger than that in the proposed method as can be seen in fig 25 the optimal discharge flow process determined by the poa is difficult to switch directly to the operating rule of a reservoir consisting of fully opened floodgates according to time in other words to match the discharge flow of the reservoir of each time step some floodgates must be fully opened and other floodgates must be partially opened this discharge flow process does not meet the demands raised by reservoir managers furthermore the total simulation time is much shorter than the poa when using the proposed method in the poa the reservoir water level is discrete into δ z intervals from the minimal water level to the maximal level for flood control in order to compose all the possible water level states and then the recursive calculation is performed for all possible state of water levels at each time stage of the simulation for instance if the value of δ z is set to 0 001 as shown in table 6 it is necessary to carry out over 10 000 iteration calculations for each time stage of simulation in addition approximately 1 650 000 or more recursion calculations should be conducted to complete the overall first simulation meanwhile in the pso gn algorithm if the number of particles is set to 100 and the number of iterations to 500 approximately 50 000 iteration calculations are required for the entire simulation 5 conclusion in this paper a new optimization algorithm for flood control of the reservoir system based on the pso gn algorithm combined with rmpsg method is proposed and its performance is compared with that of the pso q algorithm and poa the following conclusions could be drawn from this study 1 the proposed method provides more practical and convenient operation rules of the reservoir system for reservoir managers compared to the traditional optimization methods already developed using the proposed method the optimal operation rules of the reservoirs consisting of the fully opened floodgates according to time is directly determined the pso gn algorithm which uses a group of particles consisting of random integer arrays from 0 to gn has a much broader search range than the pso q algorithm and shows excellent search capability for objective value compared to other algorithms used in the paper the rmpsg method recombines and evaluates partial solution groups in the initial solution determined by the pso gn algorithm and finally produces a stable and reasonable global optimal solution with continuous discharge time this method of determining the final solution through the combination of the pso gn algorithm that amplifies the intelligent optimization characteristics of the pso algorithm and the rmpsg method that wittily recombines partial solution groups constituting the initial solution is theoretically superior to other existing algorithms and practically satisfies the demands of reservoir managers 2 the effectiveness and superiority of the method proposed in the paper were confirmed through comparative simulations for flood control of the chongchen river although the maximum controlled discharge from the reservoir is larger than the compared methods the minimum flood peak discharge in the downstream was the smallest compared to the other two methods when applying the proposed method in the flood event in august 2016 the flood peak discharge at the downstream protection place is 8994 m 3 s reducing 40 28 of the expected natural flood peak inflow on the other hand when using the pso q algorithm flood peak reduction rate at the downstream protection place is 28 81 in the flood event in september 2014 the flood peak discharge at the downstream protection place is 7201 m 3 s by the proposed method reducing 41 98 of the expected natural flood peak inflow meanwhile when applying the poa flood peak reduction rate at the downstream protection place is 31 62 furthermore the total computation time of the simulation is much faster compared to poa when using the proposed method by employing the proposed method in the two flood events used as a case study the average simulation time is 27 5 s which is very short compared to the poa 115 s and shows the advantage of the intelligent optimization method although the proposed method is efficient for the optimal operation of the gate controlled reservoir system the performance comparison with other optimization methods for the complex reservoir system has not been conducted further research is needed to determine the optimal operation of the gate controlled reservoir consisting of fully and partially opened floodgates according to time to extend the practicality of this method credit authorship contribution statement yong gun kim

4913,the streamflow components in a small agricultural watershed were determined using a three component hydrograph separation model rainfall throughfall soil water groundwater irrigation water and stream water samples were collected from a headwater catchment consisting of a natural forested area and from the downstream agricultural catchment outlet where rice paddy fields are developed extensively along the stream the purpose of this study was to compare streamflow generation patterns between the forested and agricultural watersheds we differentiated pre event and event water contributions to streamflow for seven rainfall events using chemical and isotopic tracers all of the stream water samples collected from the upper headwater station were plotted within the three component end members groundwater soil water and precipitation whereas at the lower catchment outlet station stream water samples collected during the agricultural season deviated clearly from the three component mixing analysis indicating the addition of a new water source irrigation return flow to the streamflow our findings indicate that pre event groundwater was the major contribution to streamflow in the headwater catchment whereas event rainwater and irrigation return flow were the major contributors to streamflow in the lower part catchment during the agricultural season keywords

that partitions the contributions of new water or event water such as rainfall or throughfall and old water or pre event water such as groundwater and soil water stored in the watershed prior to a rainfall event to stream runoff taylor et al 2002 uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 storm hydrograph separation has resulted in major advances in catchment hydrology in the past 50 years buttle 1994 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 great achievements in isotope hydrograph separation ihs have been made in recent decades recently klaus and mcdonnell 2013 provided a comprehensive review and evaluation of the main achievements in ihs studies during the last two decades the introduction of water isotopes as a tool for storm hydrograph separation was a quantum leap in watershed hydrology as the water isotopes are ideal and conservative tracers therefore most hydrograph separation studies now use stable water isotopes 2h and 18o along with chemical tracers such as dissolved silica si and chloride cl based on achievements in ihs in the last 20 years klaus and mcdonnell 2013 suggested that five characteristics are especially important in runoff generation in catchments catchment size land use landscape organization initial system state and storm characteristics among them this study focused on land use initial system state and landscape organization for the investigation of runoff generation pattern in a small agricultural watershed land use patterns such as agriculture and urbanization play important roles in altering stream responses to rainfall events machavaram et al 2006 jefferson et al 2015 thus natural and human induced land use changes are expected to significantly change hydrological behavior the downstream area in this study site contains areas of residential development and is thus a typical representative of human induced land use jefferson et al 2015 storage effect is closely linked to initial system state and storm characteristics various studies showed that the initial states of the catchment prior to a rainfall event strongly influences event water contributions klaus and mcdonnell 2013 on the other hand regarding landscape organization the direction of the wetland effects in event pre event water partitioning has been controversial klaus and mcdonnell 2013 jefferson et al 2015 the downstream agricultural watershed of this study site can be regarded as being wetland rice field dominated with potential effects of irrigation water on stream flow during the agricultural season irrigation water stored in paddy fields in agricultural watershed potentially influences streamflow when it is drained into stream however to our knowledge no study so far has tried to examine the role of irrigation return flow to streamflow generation in agricultural watersheds this study was conducted to evaluate and quantify the contributions of three end member components to streamflow in two ditches installed at the headwater catchment and catchment outlet respectively in an agricultural watershed during the agricultural season in our recent companion paper park et al 2018 we documented the major effects of irrigation return flow during the agricultural season on stream water chemistry and shallow groundwater quality in the study area thus in order to investigate the wetland rice field effects on streamflow generation we examined a new role of irrigation return flow from rice paddy fields adding the water components 2 sites and methodology 2 1 site description the study area is a small agricultural catchment 0 033 km2 for the headwater catchment and 3 7 km2 for the whole catchment the catchment area has an elevation ranging from 48 m to 127 m above sea level a perennial stream originates in the forested area and flows through the agricultural areas in its middle lower reaches fig 1 the forest in the headwater catchment is naturally preserved from contamination by human activities the streamflow at the upper station was very low and remained at an almost constant value 0 4 l s during the dry season lee et al 2006 of the stream s discharge area ca 3 7 km2 the forested and agricultural areas comprise ca 58 2 15 km2 and 33 1 22 km2 respectively and the remainder 9 is used as a residential area park et al 2018 in this discharge area intensive rice paddy farming activities occur from april to october agricultural season but typically not from november to early march non agricultural season rice paddy fields are distributed mainly around streams whereas dry paddy fields are developed along the base of the mountain fig 1 several irrigation systems have been developed to utilize groundwater as agricultural water the irrigation water taken from the groundwater and stream water flows into streams and or infiltrates into the ground without proper treatment after irrigation no information is available on how much groundwater and stream water were used for irrigation water park et al 2018 the catchment consists mainly of precambrian granite gneiss and quarternary alluvium um and lee 1963 the granite gneiss shows distinct foliation structure the mineral assemblage of the granite gneiss consists of quartz plagioclase biotite muscovite and clay minerals such as kaolinite and montmorillonite the catchment area forms a gently sloping terrain with well developed soils to investigate the development of soil it was excavated to a depth of one meter soils consisted of silt 17 1 30 0 sand 24 1 56 5 and pebble 26 4 55 4 corresponding to roam and silt loam the effective soil depth was 20 cm in areas over the middle of the mountain but it was more than 1 m in areas covered with alluvial layer korean soil information system http soil rda go kr the headwater catchment area is more than 90 forested and has been preserved from contamination by human activities the study area is temperate with four distinct seasons the annual mean temperature is 11 8 c the precipitation is approximately 1100 mm year and ca 80 of precipitation is concentrated during the rainy season june september http www kma go kr in our study area the hydrological environment differs entirely between the headwater catchment and the catchment outlet the headwater catchment from which the stream begins consists of a naturally conserved forest free of pollution sources whereas the catchment outlet area features rice paddy fields developed intensively along the stream rice paddy farming requires large amounts of water during the agricultural season large amounts of irrigation water were often stored in rice paddy fields in the study area therefore the study area provides an excellent test bed for the comparison of runoff generation patterns between the forested headwater catchment and the downstream agricultural watershed as well as for a surface water storage that can potentially affect stormflow 2 2 sampling and analysis the sampling campaign was conducted by collecting samples of rainfall throughfall soil water stream water irrigation water and groundwater soil water and baseflow waters were sampled before the start of an event to represent pre event water soil water was collected using lysimeters installed at various depths 15 30 60 and 90 cm in the headwater forested catchment and in dry paddy fields in the downstream area fig 1 stream water samples were collected from the upper and lower stations throughout rainfall events flow meters bfm002 valeport devon uk were installed at the upper and lower stations to automatically measure the stream water flow every 10 min the precision of stream flow measurement was 0 00001 m3 s facilities that measure rainfall amounts at 10 min intervals were also operated bulk rainfall and throughfall were collected using 20 l containers preloaded with liquid paraffin to avoid evaporation for the analysis of dissolved ions water samples were transferred to 60 ml high density polyethylene bottles through 0 45 μm membrane filters the water samples used for cation analysis were acidified with ultrapure hno3 until a ph of 2 was reached after filtering in the field cation si and anions cl no3 and so4 of water samples were determined using a perkinelmer optima 4300 dv inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry at the korea basic science institute kbsi and a dionex ics 1500 ion chromatography at the korea institute of geoscience and mineral resources respectively all water samples were stored in a refrigerator until analysis the δ18o values were measured using the co2 h2o equilibration method epstein and mayeda 1953 using a gv instruments optima mass spectrometer for δ2h hydrogen gas was produced by a gv instruments euro pyroh elemental analyzer ea equipped with a quartz column loaded with metallic chromium coleman et al 1982 and its isotopic value was determined by a gv instruments isoprime mass spectrometer interfaced with the ea the oxygen and hydrogen isotope data are denoted by δ notation relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow where δ rsample rstandard 1 1000 and r represents 18o 16o or 2h 1h the analytical reproducibilities were 0 1 for δ18o and 0 5 for δ2h for strontium sr isotopic analysis approximately 60 ml of each water sample was evaporated to dryness in ultraclean teflon vessels and re dissolved in distilled hcl sr in solution was then separated from other ions using a cation exchange resin biorad ag 50 w x8 200 400 mesh in a quartz column the total sr blank level was 0 1 ng the 87sr 86sr ratios of the water samples were analyzed with multi collector high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry all isotope measurements were performed at the kbsi 2 3 choice of tracers and end members the hydrograph separation requires that the tracers be conservative i e they do not change throughout a storm or the changes can be corrected buttle 1994 as oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are parts of water molecules they directly record water movement clark and fritz 1997 therefore oxygen and hydrogen isotopes have been used for the identification and characterization of water related issues at local to regional scales despite some limitations of the use of water isotopes for hydrograph separation these isotopes continue to be the best conservative tracers for the characterization of water movement in hydrological cycles klaus and mcdonnell 2013 currently combination of chemical and isotopic tracers was often used to reduce the uncertainties involved with the use of a single tracer kendall et al 1995 marc et al 2001 therefore si and 18o were employed as tracers for hydrograph separation in this study all dissolved si was assumed to come from soil water or groundwater dissolved si has served as a good tracer in many catchments because precipitation usually contains only trace amounts wels et al 1991 laudon and slaymaker 1997 whereas groundwater and soil water that have sufficient contact time with geological materials frequently have sufficient si contents clark and fritz 1997 for this reason si is very frequently used together with other conservative isotope tracers such as 18o to separate storm hydrographs hoeg et al 2000 marc et al 2001 ihs relies on several assumptions buttle 1994 one assumption is that the isotopic compositions of the event and pre event waters differ significantly from each other hydrograph separation for a catchment requires that the water isotopic composition differs significantly between end members schmieder et al 2018 in our study isotopic compositions of six of the seven events were significantly different with those of pre event waters only for an event u 4 the isotopic compositions of the event and pre event waters were not distinguishable the event u 4 occurred in early summer water 18o likely cannot be used as a tracer for ihs during the summer in south korea because the isotopic compositions of summer rainfall are distinctively depleted and are similar to those of groundwater this similarity is attributed to the amount effect of summer rainfall lee et al 2003 the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of rainfall can vary during storm events clark and fritz 1997 fischer et al 2017 cayuela et al 2018 a few recent studies reported that the isotopic composition of rainfall can vary in time and space during a rainfall event even in a small catchment 10 km2 and the spatio temporal variability of the input signal had a significant impact on hydrograph separation results fischer et al 2017 cayuela et al 2018 in addition the isotopic composition of throughfall can be affected by canopy interception processes cayuela et al 2018 however gibson et al 2000 argued based on a longer sampling period at their study site that there was no statistically significant difference between the isotopic compositions of open precipitation and throughfall that is temporal variability can be masked when bulk samples are used cayuela et al 2018 therefore bulk rainfall and throughfall samples were collected to investigate spatial variability of isotopic compositions in this study no significant differences in isotopic compositions between bulk rainfall and throughfall were found in this study throughfall samples were only 0 22 enriched in δ18o compared to open rainfall samples the reported δ18o gradient of the altitude effect in south korea is 0 15 100 m elevation increase lee et al 1999 there is a small difference in elevation in the study area ranging from 48 to 127 m above sea level fig 1 a small spatial variability in isotopic compositions was observed in the study area but was not the main interest in this study considering both a small isotopic difference between bulk rainfall and throughfall and a small elevation difference observed in the study area spatial variation in the δ18o of rainfall may be small in this study baseflow water collected from the stream prior to rainfall events was used to represent groundwater originating naturally from the saturated zone hogan and blum 2003 this assumption was valid in our study area because the 87sr 86sr δ18o and δ2h values of baseflow water 0 74722 8 76 and 59 3 respectively collected from the headwater catchment were almost identical to those of groundwater from wells collected near the stream 0 74643 8 68 and 58 5 respectively these values suggest that stream baseflow collected prior to a rainfall event consisted exclusively of groundwater hogan and blum 2003 argued that the degree of variation in the isotopic composition of groundwater prior to stormflow events is negligible at the catchment scale dewalle et al 1988 found a significant difference in isotopic composition between groundwater and vadose soil water in a small forested catchment our study area also showed a significant difference in isotopic composition between groundwater and soil water baseflow δ18o and δ2h in the study area comprised a constant isotopic signature whereas soil water δ18o and δ2h varied significantly in time and space in addition baseflow 87sr 86sr ratios avg 0 74722 differed greatly from those of soil water avg 0 72360 and rainfall avg 0 71335 average chemical and isotopic values of soil water collected from various depths at the headwater catchment and in the downstream area prior to rainfall events were used as end member values for soil water in the study area 2 4 hydrograph separation model hydrograph separation consists of quantification of the various sources contributing to stream discharge hinton et al 1994 kendall et al 1995 huth et al 2004 in the mid 1990s researchers found that soil water in unsaturated zones of some catchments significantly affected hydrograph separation that is soil water was found to be another important source contributing to stream discharge in those catchments buttle 1994 hinton et al 1994 kendall et al 1995 lakey and krothe 1996 therefore soil water was incorporated as a water source in this study because isotopic compositions of soil water differed entirely from those of groundwater a three component mixing model was used to calculate the proportion of stream water derived from each of the three sources of runoff groundwater precipitation and soil water assuming that flow sources had distinct chemical or isotopic signatures burns et al 2001 uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 for three sources contributing to streamflow the proportions of old and new water in the stream discharge are determined by following three mass balance equations using isotope and chemical tracers 1 q t q gw q p q s 2 q t δ t q gw δ gw q p δ p q s δ s 3 q t c t q gw c gw q p c p q s c s where q is the discharge δ is the isotopic composition c is the tracer concentration and the subscript t gw p and s refer to total flow component groundwater precipitation and soil water respectively with use of the measured values in these three equations the relative ratios of groundwater precipitation and soil water in the total stream discharge can be calculated 3 results 3 1 streamflow generation in a forested headwater catchment for hydrograph separation for a small forested headwater catchment four storm events occurring between april and july 2005 were selected fig 2 the hydrological parameters were summarized in table 1 the first hydrograph separation was performed for an event u 1 occurring on 9 11 april 2005 the amount of rainfall was 46 2 mm and rainfall lasted for 24 h table 1 the runoff event was the result of low intensity rainfall 2 mm h the si content and δ18o of stream water showed considerable variation during the storm event fig 3 a little rainfall occurred for months before the first event samples were taken table 1 after 19 h rainfall the stream discharge began to increase measurably the stream discharge was 0 133 l s before the rainfall and was increased to 0 156 l s by the rainfall that is even at peak streamflow the stream runoff increased by only 17 3 relative to the baseflow the second hydrograph separation was conducted for an event u 2 occurring on 17 18 may 2005 the amount of rainfall was 22 7 mm and rainfall was concentrated during a short time period 10 5 h the stream discharge was 0 122 l s before the rainfall and was increased to 0 133 l s by the rainfall the si content and δ18o of stream water varied significantly with time fig 3b three or four minor rainfall events occurred prior to the event u 2 the stream discharge began to increase after 9 5 h rainfall at peak streamflow the stream runoff increased by only 9 0 relative to the baseflow state the third hydrograph separation was conducted for an event u 3 occurring on 1 2 june 2005 the amount of rainfall was 38 3 mm and rainfall lasted for 9 h the stream runoff began to increase after 5 h rainfall the stream discharge was 0 122 l s before the rainfall and was increased to 0 938 l s at peak streamflow fig 3c the response from streamflow was faster in this event than in the previous two events stream discharge increased greatly compared with the previous two events the fourth hydrograph separation was conducted for an event u 4 occurring on 1 july 2005 the rainfall event u 4 was an intense storm that lasted for only 2 2 h and produced 24 5 mm rain the event was the result of a sudden downpour stream runoff began to increase rapidly at 0 5 h after the start of the rainfall following a short period of very intensive rainfall the stream discharge was 0 133 l s before the rainfall and was increased to 3 479 l s at peak flow fig 3d despite the small amount of rainfall the increase in stream discharge was the greatest among the four events examined from the upper station the rainfall amount was only 64 that of event u 3 but the stream runoff was approximately five times greater 3 2 streamflow generation in an agricultural catchment outlet for hydrograph separation for a rice paddy field dominated catchment water samples were taken from the lower station to examine three rainfall events occurring in the summers of 2005 and 2006 fig 2 hydrological data for these three rainfall events are summarized in table 1 the first hydrograph separation from the lower station was carried out for an event l 1 occurring on 8 10 july 2005 the amount of rainfall was 35 9 mm and the rainfall lasted for 18 h the stream discharge was 2 63 l s before the rainfall and was increased markedly to 2228 l s after the rainfall the si concentration and δ18o of stream water decreased gradually with the progress of rainfall and then increased with time after the rainfall fig 4 a water samples were collected and analyzed for an event l 2 which occurred on 10 11 june 2006 the amount of rainfall was 39 0 mm and rainfall lasted for 14 h the stream discharge was 15 3 l s before the rainfall and was increased to 307 l s after the rainfall although the rainfall amounts of events l 1 and l 2 were very similar the peak stream discharge of event l 2 307 l s was only 13 8 that of event l 1 2228 l s the cl concentration decreased as the discharge increased fig 4b variations in the si concentration and δ18o of stream water were opposite to that in the discharge whereas variations in the no3 and so4 concentrations were similar to that in the discharge fig 4b cl and δ18o in stream water were decreased during the early rainy period before 21 00 whereas no3 and so4 concentrations were slightly increased from 21 00 until after the rain stopped cl and δ18o increased gradually and then remained constant with relatively high values variations in no3 and so4 showed the opposite trend decreasing gradually and then remaining constant water samples were collected for a rainfall event l 3 that occurred on 14 15 june 2006 the amount of rainfall was 64 0 mm and rainfall lasted for 13 h the discharge rate was 15 3 l s before the rainfall and was increased to 2075 l s after the rainfall event l 3 occurred only 3 days after event l 2 dissolved anions decreased with the progress of the rainfall then increased gradually after the rainfall the si content and δ18o decreased gradually with the rainfall then remained constant after the rainfall fig 4c 3 3 end member mixing analysis emma three component mixing analysis was conducted for four rainfall events in the forested catchment and for three rainfall events in agricultural catchment outlet the results of the hydrograph separation for the events are described below and summarized in table 2 for event u 1 on a three component mixing diagram the stream water consisted mainly of groundwater with a small portion of rainfall fig 5 a it was apparent that soil water contributed little to streamflow the streamflow consisted of 83 0 groundwater 1 3 soil water and 15 7 rainwater table 2 no significant differences in streamflow components were found between using bulk rainfall and throughfall as input signals table 2 groundwater was also the main contributor to stream runoff for event u 2 fig 5a as for event u 1 soil water contributed little to the stream water the streamflow was composed of 85 2 groundwater 2 9 soil water and 11 9 rainwater table 2 for event u 3 the total stream runoff was composed of 46 2 groundwater 3 0 soil water and 50 8 rainfall table 2 the soil water component appeared during peak streamflow in this case significant differences in streamflow components were found between using rainfall and throughfall as input signals 5 5 uncertainty in pre event water contribution table 2 this relatively large uncertainty resulted from the small difference in isotopic compositions between input water and baseflow cayuela et al 2018 compared with those for the previous three events the δ18o value for event u 4 was much more negative 8 5 no mixing trend between rainfall and groundwater based on 18o si tracers was observed because the δ18o value of rainfall 8 5 was almost identical to that for groundwater 8 4 fig 5b therefore hydrograph separation using δ18o was unsuitable for the event u 4 for event l 1 the si concentrations and δ18o values for stream water were plotted along a mixing line between rainfall and groundwater fig 6 a event l 1 and baseflow samples were suitable for hydrograph separation because of the large difference in δ18o values between them in the early stage of stream runoff increase after the rainfall no soil water component was observed in streamflow soil water was observed only when the stream runoff reached its main peak fig 7 this phenomenon was observed both upstream and downstream the soil water contribution to stream runoff was 5 of the total streamflow table 2 the streamflow collected from downstream on 8 10 july 2005 consisted of 26 6 groundwater 4 4 soil water and 69 0 rainfall table 2 that is the streamflow was dominated by event stormwater in the agricultural catchment for event l 2 streamflow samples collected after the rainfall were plotted very far from the three component mixing analysis consisting of rainfall groundwater and soil water until sometime after the rainfall stopped the composition of the stream water changed in the direction of rainfall within the three component system denoted by 1 5 in fig 6b however over time stream water deviated clearly from the three component system and moved toward another component denoted by 6 10 in fig 6b irrigation return flow as irrigation return flow is a new source for streams near rice paddy fields park et al 2018 in terms of fraction stream water was likely to account for the contributions of rainfall groundwater and irrigation return flow fig 6b when the rainfall stopped the stream water recovered in the direction of the baseflow for event l 3 streamflow samples collected after the rainfall also deviated significantly from the area consisting of the three component end members rainfall groundwater and soil water fig 6c most stream water samples accounted for rainfall groundwater and irrigation return flow as in the event l 2 in contrast to event l 2 in event l 3 the compositions of the stream water on the plot of δ18o and si changed vaguely within the three component end members rainfall groundwater and irrigation return flow fig 6c in addition δ18o and si values for event l 3 stream water were lower and the ranges of variation were narrower avg 6 5 0 51 and 3 64 1 22 μg l respectively compared with those for event l 2 avg 5 5 0 99 and 4 17 1 32 μg l respectively the stream water did not clearly recover in the direction of the baseflow when the rainfall stopped 4 discussion 4 1 streamflow response to storms hydrograph separation provides information about the contributions of precipitation soil water and groundwater to stream runoff as well as hydrological processes and recharge properties of groundwater during a rainfall event the generation and response time of runoff are related closely to soil moisture conditions prior to a rainfall event and rainfall intensity dewalle et al 1988 buttle 1994 katsuyma et al 2001 argued that only groundwater in the saturated zone and precipitation affect streamflow when the groundwater level is low whereas groundwater in the transient saturated zone becomes a third component when the groundwater level rises and the saturated zone expands in our study no soil water component was observed in hydrograph separation for the early stage of stream runoff but this component appeared when the amount of stream runoff peaked fig 7 these findings indicate that soil water in the vadose zone was released to the stream channel through a displacement mechanism as a result of groundwater rising due to event rainfall katsuyma et al 2001 ladouche et al 2001 the pre event water that reaches the stream channel during a storm event may be supplied from a fairly localized near stream zone buttle 1994 in event u 1 in the forested catchment the stream discharge began to increase at 19 h after the start of the rainfall that is most rain that fell in the first 19 h penetrated into the unsaturated upper soil zone or was partly evaporated into the atmosphere leaving little water supply to streamflow stream discharge barely increased despite the significant amount of rainfall this phenomenon can be explained by the infiltration of most event rainfall into the soil due to extreme unsaturation attributable to the long period of dry days before the rainfall event this result was closely related to antecedent rainfall table 1 very little outflow of soil water was observed in event u 1 table 1 considering the δ18o δ2h and 87sr 86sr ratios of baseflow and soil waters the proportion of soil water in baseflow was negligible in addition we observed that a rainfall threshold of ca 20 mm day was required to initiate flow in the headwater stream during the dry season in the study area for event u 2 the stream discharge started to increase measurably after 9 5 h rainfall although the rainfall amount of event u 2 was only about half that of event u 1 stream runoff was generated much more quickly by event u 2 than by event u 1 because the soil was more saturated by antecedent rainfall that occurred prior to event u 2 for example rainfall amount for 7 days prior to the event u 2 was 6 mm much higher than event u 1 table 1 in event u 3 stream runoff began to increase after 6 2 h rainfall the amount of rainfall during event u 3 38 3 mm was less than that of event u 1 46 2 mm however stream discharge and the relative contribution of rainfall to streamflow were increased greatly in the event u 3 the relative contribution of rainfall to streamflow was greatly increased in event u 3 compared with the previous two events although the rainfall amount of event u 3 was much smaller than that of event u 1 table 1 the rainfall amount in event u 4 was only 64 of that in event u 3 but the stream runoff was approximately five times larger table 1 these increases were related closely to soil moisture conditions and rainfall intensity in this case the soil was sufficiently saturated by frequent antecedent rainfall events and the rainfall was more intense 11 1 mm h than in the previous three events 4 26 mm h fig 2 with increased soil saturation rainwater is likely to flow overland directly into the stream channel brown et al 1999 ribolzi et al 2000 this result can be explained by the quantity of rainfall flowing overland directly into the stream due to very intense 11 1 mm h rainfall for 2 2 h and soil saturation by several antecedent rainfall events ladouche et al 2001 the amount of groundwater discharged into a stream has been observed to increase with stream discharge stored soil water and groundwater are displaced to the stream by infiltrating event rainfall dewalle et al 1988 as rainfall infiltrates underground it gradually pushes groundwater into the stream buttle 1994 therefore we estimated that most rainfall from event u 4 flowed directly into the stream and the relative contribution of rainfall increased compared with that in the previous hydrograph separations to summarize rainfall that occurred during the dry season infiltrated into the soil or was partly evaporated into the atmosphere in the study area with no significant discharge to streamflow due to the unsaturated state of the soil in dry periods this result suggests that most rainfall is stored in unsaturated soil in the dry season ladouche et al 2001 as shown by the delayed increase in stream discharge for events u 1 u 2 and u 3 rainfall events do not generate large responses under dry soil conditions however rainfall that occurred during the rainy season tended to flow mainly into the stream because the soil was sufficiently saturated by antecedent rainfalls frequent rainfall increases soil moisture and speeds the overland flow of rainwater into stream channels with time a rise in the proportion of direct rainwater runoff is observed ribolzi et al 2000 our findings indicate that the relative proportion of rainfall to streamflow produced by a rainfall event increases with the rainfall intensity and amount and that the streamflow response time to a storm shortens with increasing soil saturation our findings also indicate that pre event groundwater was the major contributor to streamflow in the forested headwater catchment whereas event rainwater was the major contributor to streamflow in the agricultural catchment laudon et al 2007 that is event water contributions were greater in the agricultural catchment containing rice paddy wetlands than in the solely forested catchment the effect of wetlands in event pre event water partitioning has been previously observed the direction of the wetland effects has been contradicting klaus and mcdonnell 2013 it was reported that a wetland dominated catchment reduced the fraction of event water compared to a forest dominated catchment roa garcia and weiler 2010 on the other hand laudon et al 2007 showed higher event water contributions in catchments containing wetlands compared to solely forested catchments our result is consistent with this result the rainfall component was dominant in streamflow in the agricultural catchment outlet table 2 fig 7c which can be attributed to the effects of the residential area and wetland like rice paddy fields which increase the area of impervious surfaces and the dominance of overland flow runoff for example although the rainfall amounts of events l 1 and l 2 were very similar the peak stream discharge of event l 2 307 l s was only 13 8 that of event l 1 2228 l s such a weak increase in the discharge rate may indicate the absence of overland flow during event l 2 ribolzi et al 2000 4 2 contribution of irrigation return flow to streamflow for the separation of streamflow components using a three component mixing model only three sources must influence stream runoff however as mentioned in the result section describing events l 2 and l 3 three component hydrograph separation was impossible for the summer samples collected at the lower station because they did not satisfy the assumption that the contribution of stored surface water ponds swamps etc to the stream should be negligible suggested by sklash and farvolden 1979 for event l 2 in the agricultural catchment cl and δ18o values decreased during the early rainy period due to the relatively dominant contribution of rainfall to stream water fig 4b at the end of the rainy period these values would increase due to the introduction of irrigation return flow derived from rice paddy fields that is typically irrigation return flow included a high concentration of cl and was 18o enriched due to evaporation triggered by stagnancy during the growing season june september due to the impoundment of water the rice paddy fields were anoxic and denitrification processes could develop irrigation return flow samples under denitrification had low no3 contents stream water samples corresponding to the period in which the no3 concentration decreased and then remained constant were in agreement with those in the estimated three component system denoted by 6 10 in fig 6b these results strongly indicate that irrigation return flow contributed significantly to the stream water by comparison stream water in event l 3 was affected by the relatively greater rainfall fraction anion concentrations were decreased during the rainfall and then recovered markedly although variation in the discharge rate was clearly observed the movement of stream water on the estimated three component system was not systematic as for event l 2 therefore the contribution of irrigation return flow to stream water was masked by rainfall rainfall and soil water samples fell along the lmwl δ2h 8 22 δ18o 10 8 generated by rainy season rainfall samples n 18 indicating that they were little affected by evaporation processes fig 8 in addition all δ18o and δ2h values for stream water collected prior to the events l 2 and l 3 also fell along or near the lmwl however stream water samples collected during events l 2 and l 3 deviated significantly from the lmwl these samples fell along two different mixing lines stream water samples for event l 2 fell along an evaporation line with a slope of 4 99 interpreted as a mixing line between event water and irrigation return flow that underwent severe evaporation compared with event l 1 the increase of streamflow in event l 2 was significantly small for this reason irrigation return flow is likely to easily affect stream water with a small amount of discharge irrigation water stored for a long time in rice paddy fields could be isotopically enriched due to evaporation during summer and was included in the hydrograph separation as another pre event component on the other hand stream water samples collected during event l 3 fell along another mixing line with a slope of 5 57 between rainfall and irrigation return flow fig 8 one important assumption for hydrograph separation is that surface storage contributes minimally to the streamflow sklash and farvolden 1979 buttle 1994 however some studies showed that the contribution of stored surface water ponds swamps etc to the stream was not negligible uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 jefferson et al 2015 we documented that irrigation water stored in paddy fields in agricultural watershed strongly influenced streamflow when it was drained into stream in summary our results showed that groundwater was a major contributor to stream discharge at the headwater catchment while at the outlet of the catchment irrigation return flow from rice paddy fields played a new role adding the water components 5 conclusions hydrograph separation is very useful for the study of stream runoff generation processes a three component hydrograph separation technique was applied to investigate the contributions of rainfall soil water and groundwater to the stream discharge in a small agricultural catchment the purposes of the study were to compare streamflow generation patterns between the forest dominated headwater catchment and the wet paddy field dominated downstream catchment emma showed that rainfall and groundwater were the main contributors to stream discharge soil water contributed only 5 during the main peak flow our finding demonstrated that groundwater flow controlled baseflow and was the major contributor to stream discharge in a small headwater forested catchment suggesting that most of the rainfall was stored in the soil during the dry period meanwhile event water and irrigation water were the major contributors to stream discharge in the lower part catchment outlet irrigation water stored in rice paddy fields prior to the stormflow event underwent strong evaporation due to the long period of dry days irrigation return flow had great impacts on stream chemistry and runoff generation in the agricultural watershed and played an important role as a new source the combined use of chemical and isotopic tracers makes evident the addition of a new water source such as irrigation return flow into stream runoff when

4913,the streamflow components in a small agricultural watershed were determined using a three component hydrograph separation model rainfall throughfall soil water groundwater irrigation water and stream water samples were collected from a headwater catchment consisting of a natural forested area and from the downstream agricultural catchment outlet where rice paddy fields are developed extensively along the stream the purpose of this study was to compare streamflow generation patterns between the forested and agricultural watersheds we differentiated pre event and event water contributions to streamflow for seven rainfall events using chemical and isotopic tracers all of the stream water samples collected from the upper headwater station were plotted within the three component end members groundwater soil water and precipitation whereas at the lower catchment outlet station stream water samples collected during the agricultural season deviated clearly from the three component mixing analysis indicating the addition of a new water source irrigation return flow to the streamflow our findings indicate that pre event groundwater was the major contribution to streamflow in the headwater catchment whereas event rainwater and irrigation return flow were the major contributors to streamflow in the lower part catchment during the agricultural season keywords agricultural watershed hydrograph separation irrigation return flow streamflow chemical and isotopic tracers 1 introduction streamflow generation and dynamics in catchments are important issues for water resource management machavaram et al 2006 to understand these issues hydrologists have attempted to determine streamflow components and hydrological processes in many parts of the world s catchments under different environmental conditions using hydrograph separation techniques buttle 1994 brown et al 1999 jefferson et al 2015 schmieder et al 2018 hydrograph separation is a technique that partitions the contributions of new water or event water such as rainfall or throughfall and old water or pre event water such as groundwater and soil water stored in the watershed prior to a rainfall event to stream runoff taylor et al 2002 uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 storm hydrograph separation has resulted in major advances in catchment hydrology in the past 50 years buttle 1994 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 great achievements in isotope hydrograph separation ihs have been made in recent decades recently klaus and mcdonnell 2013 provided a comprehensive review and evaluation of the main achievements in ihs studies during the last two decades the introduction of water isotopes as a tool for storm hydrograph separation was a quantum leap in watershed hydrology as the water isotopes are ideal and conservative tracers therefore most hydrograph separation studies now use stable water isotopes 2h and 18o along with chemical tracers such as dissolved silica si and chloride cl based on achievements in ihs in the last 20 years klaus and mcdonnell 2013 suggested that five characteristics are especially important in runoff generation in catchments catchment size land use landscape organization initial system state and storm characteristics among them this study focused on land use initial system state and landscape organization for the investigation of runoff generation pattern in a small agricultural watershed land use patterns such as agriculture and urbanization play important roles in altering stream responses to rainfall events machavaram et al 2006 jefferson et al 2015 thus natural and human induced land use changes are expected to significantly change hydrological behavior the downstream area in this study site contains areas of residential development and is thus a typical representative of human induced land use jefferson et al 2015 storage effect is closely linked to initial system state and storm characteristics various studies showed that the initial states of the catchment prior to a rainfall event strongly influences event water contributions klaus and mcdonnell 2013 on the other hand regarding landscape organization the direction of the wetland effects in event pre event water partitioning has been controversial klaus and mcdonnell 2013 jefferson et al 2015 the downstream agricultural watershed of this study site can be regarded as being wetland rice field dominated with potential effects of irrigation water on stream flow during the agricultural season irrigation water stored in paddy fields in agricultural watershed potentially influences streamflow when it is drained into stream however to our knowledge no study so far has tried to examine the role of irrigation return flow to streamflow generation in agricultural watersheds this study was conducted to evaluate and quantify the contributions of three end member components to streamflow in two ditches installed at the headwater catchment and catchment outlet respectively in an agricultural watershed during the agricultural season in our recent companion paper park et al 2018 we documented the major effects of irrigation return flow during the agricultural season on stream water chemistry and shallow groundwater quality in the study area thus in order to investigate the wetland rice field effects on streamflow generation we examined a new role of irrigation return flow from rice paddy fields adding the water components 2 sites and methodology 2 1 site description the study area is a small agricultural catchment 0 033 km2 for the headwater catchment and 3 7 km2 for the whole catchment the catchment area has an elevation ranging from 48 m to 127 m above sea level a perennial stream originates in the forested area and flows through the agricultural areas in its middle lower reaches fig 1 the forest in the headwater catchment is naturally preserved from contamination by human activities the streamflow at the upper station was very low and remained at an almost constant value 0 4 l s during the dry season lee et al 2006 of the stream s discharge area ca 3 7 km2 the forested and agricultural areas comprise ca 58 2 15 km2 and 33 1 22 km2 respectively and the remainder 9 is used as a residential area park et al 2018 in this discharge area intensive rice paddy farming activities occur from april to october agricultural season but typically not from november to early march non agricultural season rice paddy fields are distributed mainly around streams whereas dry paddy fields are developed along the base of the mountain fig 1 several irrigation systems have been developed to utilize groundwater as agricultural water the irrigation water taken from the groundwater and stream water flows into streams and or infiltrates into the ground without proper treatment after irrigation no information is available on how much groundwater and stream water were used for irrigation water park et al 2018 the catchment consists mainly of precambrian granite gneiss and quarternary alluvium um and lee 1963 the granite gneiss shows distinct foliation structure the mineral assemblage of the granite gneiss consists of quartz plagioclase biotite muscovite and clay minerals such as kaolinite and montmorillonite the catchment area forms a gently sloping terrain with well developed soils to investigate the development of soil it was excavated to a depth of one meter soils consisted of silt 17 1 30 0 sand 24 1 56 5 and pebble 26 4 55 4 corresponding to roam and silt loam the effective soil depth was 20 cm in areas over the middle of the mountain but it was more than 1 m in areas covered with alluvial layer korean soil information system http soil rda go kr the headwater catchment area is more than 90 forested and has been preserved from contamination by human activities the study area is temperate with four distinct seasons the annual mean temperature is 11 8 c the precipitation is approximately 1100 mm year and ca 80 of precipitation is concentrated during the rainy season june september http www kma go kr in our study area the hydrological environment differs entirely between the headwater catchment and the catchment outlet the headwater catchment from which the stream begins consists of a naturally conserved forest free of pollution sources whereas the catchment outlet area features rice paddy fields developed intensively along the stream rice paddy farming requires large amounts of water during the agricultural season large amounts of irrigation water were often stored in rice paddy fields in the study area therefore the study area provides an excellent test bed for the comparison of runoff generation patterns between the forested headwater catchment and the downstream agricultural watershed as well as for a surface water storage that can potentially affect stormflow 2 2 sampling and analysis the sampling campaign was conducted by collecting samples of rainfall throughfall soil water stream water irrigation water and groundwater soil water and baseflow waters were sampled before the start of an event to represent pre event water soil water was collected using lysimeters installed at various depths 15 30 60 and 90 cm in the headwater forested catchment and in dry paddy fields in the downstream area fig 1 stream water samples were collected from the upper and lower stations throughout rainfall events flow meters bfm002 valeport devon uk were installed at the upper and lower stations to automatically measure the stream water flow every 10 min the precision of stream flow measurement was 0 00001 m3 s facilities that measure rainfall amounts at 10 min intervals were also operated bulk rainfall and throughfall were collected using 20 l containers preloaded with liquid paraffin to avoid evaporation for the analysis of dissolved ions water samples were transferred to 60 ml high density polyethylene bottles through 0 45 μm membrane filters the water samples used for cation analysis were acidified with ultrapure hno3 until a ph of 2 was reached after filtering in the field cation si and anions cl no3 and so4 of water samples were determined using a perkinelmer optima 4300 dv inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry at the korea basic science institute kbsi and a dionex ics 1500 ion chromatography at the korea institute of geoscience and mineral resources respectively all water samples were stored in a refrigerator until analysis the δ18o values were measured using the co2 h2o equilibration method epstein and mayeda 1953 using a gv instruments optima mass spectrometer for δ2h hydrogen gas was produced by a gv instruments euro pyroh elemental analyzer ea equipped with a quartz column loaded with metallic chromium coleman et al 1982 and its isotopic value was determined by a gv instruments isoprime mass spectrometer interfaced with the ea the oxygen and hydrogen isotope data are denoted by δ notation relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow where δ rsample rstandard 1 1000 and r represents 18o 16o or 2h 1h the analytical reproducibilities were 0 1 for δ18o and 0 5 for δ2h for strontium sr isotopic analysis approximately 60 ml of each water sample was evaporated to dryness in ultraclean teflon vessels and re dissolved in distilled hcl sr in solution was then separated from other ions using a cation exchange resin biorad ag 50 w x8 200 400 mesh in a quartz column the total sr blank level was 0 1 ng the 87sr 86sr ratios of the water samples were analyzed with multi collector high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry all isotope measurements were performed at the kbsi 2 3 choice of tracers and end members the hydrograph separation requires that the tracers be conservative i e they do not change throughout a storm or the changes can be corrected buttle 1994 as oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are parts of water molecules they directly record water movement clark and fritz 1997 therefore oxygen and hydrogen isotopes have been used for the identification and characterization of water related issues at local to regional scales despite some limitations of the use of water isotopes for hydrograph separation these isotopes continue to be the best conservative tracers for the characterization of water movement in hydrological cycles klaus and mcdonnell 2013 currently combination of chemical and isotopic tracers was often used to reduce the uncertainties involved with the use of a single tracer kendall et al 1995 marc et al 2001 therefore si and 18o were employed as tracers for hydrograph separation in this study all dissolved si was assumed to come from soil water or groundwater dissolved si has served as a good tracer in many catchments because precipitation usually contains only trace amounts wels et al 1991 laudon and slaymaker 1997 whereas groundwater and soil water that have sufficient contact time with geological materials frequently have sufficient si contents clark and fritz 1997 for this reason si is very frequently used together with other conservative isotope tracers such as 18o to separate storm hydrographs hoeg et al 2000 marc et al 2001 ihs relies on several assumptions buttle 1994 one assumption is that the isotopic compositions of the event and pre event waters differ significantly from each other hydrograph separation for a catchment requires that the water isotopic composition differs significantly between end members schmieder et al 2018 in our study isotopic compositions of six of the seven events were significantly different with those of pre event waters only for an event u 4 the isotopic compositions of the event and pre event waters were not distinguishable the event u 4 occurred in early summer water 18o likely cannot be used as a tracer for ihs during the summer in south korea because the isotopic compositions of summer rainfall are distinctively depleted and are similar to those of groundwater this similarity is attributed to the amount effect of summer rainfall lee et al 2003 the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of rainfall can vary during storm events clark and fritz 1997 fischer et al 2017 cayuela et al 2018 a few recent studies reported that the isotopic composition of rainfall can vary in time and space during a rainfall event even in a small catchment 10 km2 and the spatio temporal variability of the input signal had a significant impact on hydrograph separation results fischer et al 2017 cayuela et al 2018 in addition the isotopic composition of throughfall can be affected by canopy interception processes cayuela et al 2018 however gibson et al 2000 argued based on a longer sampling period at their study site that there was no statistically significant difference between the isotopic compositions of open precipitation and throughfall that is temporal variability can be masked when bulk samples are used cayuela et al 2018 therefore bulk rainfall and throughfall samples were collected to investigate spatial variability of isotopic compositions in this study no significant differences in isotopic compositions between bulk rainfall and throughfall were found in this study throughfall samples were only 0 22 enriched in δ18o compared to open rainfall samples the reported δ18o gradient of the altitude effect in south korea is 0 15 100 m elevation increase lee et al 1999 there is a small difference in elevation in the study area ranging from 48 to 127 m above sea level fig 1 a small spatial variability in isotopic compositions was observed in the study area but was not the main interest in this study considering both a small isotopic difference between bulk rainfall and throughfall and a small elevation difference observed in the study area spatial variation in the δ18o of rainfall may be small in this study baseflow water collected from the stream prior to rainfall events was used to represent groundwater originating naturally from the saturated zone hogan and blum 2003 this assumption was valid in our study area because the 87sr 86sr δ18o and δ2h values of baseflow water 0 74722 8 76 and 59 3 respectively collected from the headwater catchment were almost identical to those of groundwater from wells collected near the stream 0 74643 8 68 and 58 5 respectively these values suggest that stream baseflow collected prior to a rainfall event consisted exclusively of groundwater hogan and blum 2003 argued that the degree of variation in the isotopic composition of groundwater prior to stormflow events is negligible at the catchment scale dewalle et al 1988 found a significant difference in isotopic composition between groundwater and vadose soil water in a small forested catchment our study area also showed a significant difference in isotopic composition between groundwater and soil water baseflow δ18o and δ2h in the study area comprised a constant isotopic signature whereas soil water δ18o and δ2h varied significantly in time and space in addition baseflow 87sr 86sr ratios avg 0 74722 differed greatly from those of soil water avg 0 72360 and rainfall avg 0 71335 average chemical and isotopic values of soil water collected from various depths at the headwater catchment and in the downstream area prior to rainfall events were used as end member values for soil water in the study area 2 4 hydrograph separation model hydrograph separation consists of quantification of the various sources contributing to stream discharge hinton et al 1994 kendall et al 1995 huth et al 2004 in the mid 1990s researchers found that soil water in unsaturated zones of some catchments significantly affected hydrograph separation that is soil water was found to be another important source contributing to stream discharge in those catchments buttle 1994 hinton et al 1994 kendall et al 1995 lakey and krothe 1996 therefore soil water was incorporated as a water source in this study because isotopic compositions of soil water differed entirely from those of groundwater a three component mixing model was used to calculate the proportion of stream water derived from each of the three sources of runoff groundwater precipitation and soil water assuming that flow sources had distinct chemical or isotopic signatures burns et al 2001 uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 for three sources contributing to streamflow the proportions of old and new water in the stream discharge are determined by following three mass balance equations using isotope and chemical tracers 1 q t q gw q p q s 2 q t δ t q gw δ gw q p δ p q s δ s 3 q t c t q gw c gw q p c p q s c s where q is the discharge δ is the isotopic composition c is the tracer concentration and the subscript t gw p and s refer to total flow component groundwater precipitation and soil water respectively with use of the measured values in these three equations the relative ratios of groundwater precipitation and soil water in the total stream discharge can be calculated 3 results 3 1 streamflow generation in a forested headwater catchment for hydrograph separation for a small forested headwater catchment four storm events occurring between april and july 2005 were selected fig 2 the hydrological parameters were summarized in table 1 the first hydrograph separation was performed for an event u 1 occurring on 9 11 april 2005 the amount of rainfall was 46 2 mm and rainfall lasted for 24 h table 1 the runoff event was the result of low intensity rainfall 2 mm h the si content and δ18o of stream water showed considerable variation during the storm event fig 3 a little rainfall occurred for months before the first event samples were taken table 1 after 19 h rainfall the stream discharge began to increase measurably the stream discharge was 0 133 l s before the rainfall and was increased to 0 156 l s by the rainfall that is even at peak streamflow the stream runoff increased by only 17 3 relative to the baseflow the second hydrograph separation was conducted for an event u 2 occurring on 17 18 may 2005 the amount of rainfall was 22 7 mm and rainfall was concentrated during a short time period 10 5 h the stream discharge was 0 122 l s before the rainfall and was increased to 0 133 l s by the rainfall the si content and δ18o of stream water varied significantly with time fig 3b three or four minor rainfall events occurred prior to the event u 2 the stream discharge began to increase after 9 5 h rainfall at peak streamflow the stream runoff increased by only 9 0 relative to the baseflow state the third hydrograph separation was conducted for an event u 3 occurring on 1 2 june 2005 the amount of rainfall was 38 3 mm and rainfall lasted for 9 h the stream runoff began to increase after 5 h rainfall the stream discharge was 0 122 l s before the rainfall and was increased to 0 938 l s at peak streamflow fig 3c the response from streamflow was faster in this event than in the previous two events stream discharge increased greatly compared with the previous two events the fourth hydrograph separation was conducted for an event u 4 occurring on 1 july 2005 the rainfall event u 4 was an intense storm that lasted for only 2 2 h and produced 24 5 mm rain the event was the result of a sudden downpour stream runoff began to increase rapidly at 0 5 h after the start of the rainfall following a short period of very intensive rainfall the stream discharge was 0 133 l s before the rainfall and was increased to 3 479 l s at peak flow fig 3d despite the small amount of rainfall the increase in stream discharge was the greatest among the four events examined from the upper station the rainfall amount was only 64 that of event u 3 but the stream runoff was approximately five times greater 3 2 streamflow generation in an agricultural catchment outlet for hydrograph separation for a rice paddy field dominated catchment water samples were taken from the lower station to examine three rainfall events occurring in the summers of 2005 and 2006 fig 2 hydrological data for these three rainfall events are summarized in table 1 the first hydrograph separation from the lower station was carried out for an event l 1 occurring on 8 10 july 2005 the amount of rainfall was 35 9 mm and the rainfall lasted for 18 h the stream discharge was 2 63 l s before the rainfall and was increased markedly to 2228 l s after the rainfall the si concentration and δ18o of stream water decreased gradually with the progress of rainfall and then increased with time after the rainfall fig 4 a water samples were collected and analyzed for an event l 2 which occurred on 10 11 june 2006 the amount of rainfall was 39 0 mm and rainfall lasted for 14 h the stream discharge was 15 3 l s before the rainfall and was increased to 307 l s after the rainfall although the rainfall amounts of events l 1 and l 2 were very similar the peak stream discharge of event l 2 307 l s was only 13 8 that of event l 1 2228 l s the cl concentration decreased as the discharge increased fig 4b variations in the si concentration and δ18o of stream water were opposite to that in the discharge whereas variations in the no3 and so4 concentrations were similar to that in the discharge fig 4b cl and δ18o in stream water were decreased during the early rainy period before 21 00 whereas no3 and so4 concentrations were slightly increased from 21 00 until after the rain stopped cl and δ18o increased gradually and then remained constant with relatively high values variations in no3 and so4 showed the opposite trend decreasing gradually and then remaining constant water samples were collected for a rainfall event l 3 that occurred on 14 15 june 2006 the amount of rainfall was 64 0 mm and rainfall lasted for 13 h the discharge rate was 15 3 l s before the rainfall and was increased to 2075 l s after the rainfall event l 3 occurred only 3 days after event l 2 dissolved anions decreased with the progress of the rainfall then increased gradually after the rainfall the si content and δ18o decreased gradually with the rainfall then remained constant after the rainfall fig 4c 3 3 end member mixing analysis emma three component mixing analysis was conducted for four rainfall events in the forested catchment and for three rainfall events in agricultural catchment outlet the results of the hydrograph separation for the events are described below and summarized in table 2 for event u 1 on a three component mixing diagram the stream water consisted mainly of groundwater with a small portion of rainfall fig 5 a it was apparent that soil water contributed little to streamflow the streamflow consisted of 83 0 groundwater 1 3 soil water and 15 7 rainwater table 2 no significant differences in streamflow components were found between using bulk rainfall and throughfall as input signals table 2 groundwater was also the main contributor to stream runoff for event u 2 fig 5a as for event u 1 soil water contributed little to the stream water the streamflow was composed of 85 2 groundwater 2 9 soil water and 11 9 rainwater table 2 for event u 3 the total stream runoff was composed of 46 2 groundwater 3 0 soil water and 50 8 rainfall table 2 the soil water component appeared during peak streamflow in this case significant differences in streamflow components were found between using rainfall and throughfall as input signals 5 5 uncertainty in pre event water contribution table 2 this relatively large uncertainty resulted from the small difference in isotopic compositions between input water and baseflow cayuela et al 2018 compared with those for the previous three events the δ18o value for event u 4 was much more negative 8 5 no mixing trend between rainfall and groundwater based on 18o si tracers was observed because the δ18o value of rainfall 8 5 was almost identical to that for groundwater 8 4 fig 5b therefore hydrograph separation using δ18o was unsuitable for the event u 4 for event l 1 the si concentrations and δ18o values for stream water were plotted along a mixing line between rainfall and groundwater fig 6 a event l 1 and baseflow samples were suitable for hydrograph separation because of the large difference in δ18o values between them in the early stage of stream runoff increase after the rainfall no soil water component was observed in streamflow soil water was observed only when the stream runoff reached its main peak fig 7 this phenomenon was observed both upstream and downstream the soil water contribution to stream runoff was 5 of the total streamflow table 2 the streamflow collected from downstream on 8 10 july 2005 consisted of 26 6 groundwater 4 4 soil water and 69 0 rainfall table 2 that is the streamflow was dominated by event stormwater in the agricultural catchment for event l 2 streamflow samples collected after the rainfall were plotted very far from the three component mixing analysis consisting of rainfall groundwater and soil water until sometime after the rainfall stopped the composition of the stream water changed in the direction of rainfall within the three component system denoted by 1 5 in fig 6b however over time stream water deviated clearly from the three component system and moved toward another component denoted by 6 10 in fig 6b irrigation return flow as irrigation return flow is a new source for streams near rice paddy fields park et al 2018 in terms of fraction stream water was likely to account for the contributions of rainfall groundwater and irrigation return flow fig 6b when the rainfall stopped the stream water recovered in the direction of the baseflow for event l 3 streamflow samples collected after the rainfall also deviated significantly from the area consisting of the three component end members rainfall groundwater and soil water fig 6c most stream water samples accounted for rainfall groundwater and irrigation return flow as in the event l 2 in contrast to event l 2 in event l 3 the compositions of the stream water on the plot of δ18o and si changed vaguely within the three component end members rainfall groundwater and irrigation return flow fig 6c in addition δ18o and si values for event l 3 stream water were lower and the ranges of variation were narrower avg 6 5 0 51 and 3 64 1 22 μg l respectively compared with those for event l 2 avg 5 5 0 99 and 4 17 1 32 μg l respectively the stream water did not clearly recover in the direction of the baseflow when the rainfall stopped 4 discussion 4 1 streamflow response to storms hydrograph separation provides information about the contributions of precipitation soil water and groundwater to stream runoff as well as hydrological processes and recharge properties of groundwater during a rainfall event the generation and response time of runoff are related closely to soil moisture conditions prior to a rainfall event and rainfall intensity dewalle et al 1988 buttle 1994 katsuyma et al 2001 argued that only groundwater in the saturated zone and precipitation affect streamflow when the groundwater level is low whereas groundwater in the transient saturated zone becomes a third component when the groundwater level rises and the saturated zone expands in our study no soil water component was observed in hydrograph separation for the early stage of stream runoff but this component appeared when the amount of stream runoff peaked fig 7 these findings indicate that soil water in the vadose zone was released to the stream channel through a displacement mechanism as a result of groundwater rising due to event rainfall katsuyma et al 2001 ladouche et al 2001 the pre event water that reaches the stream channel during a storm event may be supplied from a fairly localized near stream zone buttle 1994 in event u 1 in the forested catchment the stream discharge began to increase at 19 h after the start of the rainfall that is most rain that fell in the first 19 h penetrated into the unsaturated upper soil zone or was partly evaporated into the atmosphere leaving little water supply to streamflow stream discharge barely increased despite the significant amount of rainfall this phenomenon can be explained by the infiltration of most event rainfall into the soil due to extreme unsaturation attributable to the long period of dry days before the rainfall event this result was closely related to antecedent rainfall table 1 very little outflow of soil water was observed in event u 1 table 1 considering the δ18o δ2h and 87sr 86sr ratios of baseflow and soil waters the proportion of soil water in baseflow was negligible in addition we observed that a rainfall threshold of ca 20 mm day was required to initiate flow in the headwater stream during the dry season in the study area for event u 2 the stream discharge started to increase measurably after 9 5 h rainfall although the rainfall amount of event u 2 was only about half that of event u 1 stream runoff was generated much more quickly by event u 2 than by event u 1 because the soil was more saturated by antecedent rainfall that occurred prior to event u 2 for example rainfall amount for 7 days prior to the event u 2 was 6 mm much higher than event u 1 table 1 in event u 3 stream runoff began to increase after 6 2 h rainfall the amount of rainfall during event u 3 38 3 mm was less than that of event u 1 46 2 mm however stream discharge and the relative contribution of rainfall to streamflow were increased greatly in the event u 3 the relative contribution of rainfall to streamflow was greatly increased in event u 3 compared with the previous two events although the rainfall amount of event u 3 was much smaller than that of event u 1 table 1 the rainfall amount in event u 4 was only 64 of that in event u 3 but the stream runoff was approximately five times larger table 1 these increases were related closely to soil moisture conditions and rainfall intensity in this case the soil was sufficiently saturated by frequent antecedent rainfall events and the rainfall was more intense 11 1 mm h than in the previous three events 4 26 mm h fig 2 with increased soil saturation rainwater is likely to flow overland directly into the stream channel brown et al 1999 ribolzi et al 2000 this result can be explained by the quantity of rainfall flowing overland directly into the stream due to very intense 11 1 mm h rainfall for 2 2 h and soil saturation by several antecedent rainfall events ladouche et al 2001 the amount of groundwater discharged into a stream has been observed to increase with stream discharge stored soil water and groundwater are displaced to the stream by infiltrating event rainfall dewalle et al 1988 as rainfall infiltrates underground it gradually pushes groundwater into the stream buttle 1994 therefore we estimated that most rainfall from event u 4 flowed directly into the stream and the relative contribution of rainfall increased compared with that in the previous hydrograph separations to summarize rainfall that occurred during the dry season infiltrated into the soil or was partly evaporated into the atmosphere in the study area with no significant discharge to streamflow due to the unsaturated state of the soil in dry periods this result suggests that most rainfall is stored in unsaturated soil in the dry season ladouche et al 2001 as shown by the delayed increase in stream discharge for events u 1 u 2 and u 3 rainfall events do not generate large responses under dry soil conditions however rainfall that occurred during the rainy season tended to flow mainly into the stream because the soil was sufficiently saturated by antecedent rainfalls frequent rainfall increases soil moisture and speeds the overland flow of rainwater into stream channels with time a rise in the proportion of direct rainwater runoff is observed ribolzi et al 2000 our findings indicate that the relative proportion of rainfall to streamflow produced by a rainfall event increases with the rainfall intensity and amount and that the streamflow response time to a storm shortens with increasing soil saturation our findings also indicate that pre event groundwater was the major contributor to streamflow in the forested headwater catchment whereas event rainwater was the major contributor to streamflow in the agricultural catchment laudon et al 2007 that is event water contributions were greater in the agricultural catchment containing rice paddy wetlands than in the solely forested catchment the effect of wetlands in event pre event water partitioning has been previously observed the direction of the wetland effects has been contradicting klaus and mcdonnell 2013 it was reported that a wetland dominated catchment reduced the fraction of event water compared to a forest dominated catchment roa garcia and weiler 2010 on the other hand laudon et al 2007 showed higher event water contributions in catchments containing wetlands compared to solely forested catchments our result is consistent with this result the rainfall component was dominant in streamflow in the agricultural catchment outlet table 2 fig 7c which can be attributed to the effects of the residential area and wetland like rice paddy fields which increase the area of impervious surfaces and the dominance of overland flow runoff for example although the rainfall amounts of events l 1 and l 2 were very similar the peak stream discharge of event l 2 307 l s was only 13 8 that of event l 1 2228 l s such a weak increase in the discharge rate may indicate the absence of overland flow during event l 2 ribolzi et al 2000 4 2 contribution of irrigation return flow to streamflow for the separation of streamflow components using a three component mixing model only three sources must influence stream runoff however as mentioned in the result section describing events l 2 and l 3 three component hydrograph separation was impossible for the summer samples collected at the lower station because they did not satisfy the assumption that the contribution of stored surface water ponds swamps etc to the stream should be negligible suggested by sklash and farvolden 1979 for event l 2 in the agricultural catchment cl and δ18o values decreased during the early rainy period due to the relatively dominant contribution of rainfall to stream water fig 4b at the end of the rainy period these values would increase due to the introduction of irrigation return flow derived from rice paddy fields that is typically irrigation return flow included a high concentration of cl and was 18o enriched due to evaporation triggered by stagnancy during the growing season june september due to the impoundment of water the rice paddy fields were anoxic and denitrification processes could develop irrigation return flow samples under denitrification had low no3 contents stream water samples corresponding to the period in which the no3 concentration decreased and then remained constant were in agreement with those in the estimated three component system denoted by 6 10 in fig 6b these results strongly indicate that irrigation return flow contributed significantly to the stream water by comparison stream water in event l 3 was affected by the relatively greater rainfall fraction anion concentrations were decreased during the rainfall and then recovered markedly although variation in the discharge rate was clearly observed the movement of stream water on the estimated three component system was not systematic as for event l 2 therefore the contribution of irrigation return flow to stream water was masked by rainfall rainfall and soil water samples fell along the lmwl δ2h 8 22 δ18o 10 8 generated by rainy season rainfall samples n 18 indicating that they were little affected by evaporation processes fig 8 in addition all δ18o and δ2h values for stream water collected prior to the events l 2 and l 3 also fell along or near the lmwl however stream water samples collected during events l 2 and l 3 deviated significantly from the lmwl these samples fell along two different mixing lines stream water samples for event l 2 fell along an evaporation line with a slope of 4 99 interpreted as a mixing line between event water and irrigation return flow that underwent severe evaporation compared with event l 1 the increase of streamflow in event l 2 was significantly small for this reason irrigation return flow is likely to easily affect stream water with a small amount of discharge irrigation water stored for a long time in rice paddy fields could be isotopically enriched due to evaporation during summer and was included in the hydrograph separation as another pre event component on the other hand stream water samples collected during event l 3 fell along another mixing line with a slope of 5 57 between rainfall and irrigation return flow fig 8 one important assumption for hydrograph separation is that surface storage contributes minimally to the streamflow sklash and farvolden 1979 buttle 1994 however some studies showed that the contribution of stored surface water ponds swamps etc to the stream was not negligible uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 jefferson et al 2015 we documented that irrigation water stored in paddy fields in agricultural watershed strongly influenced streamflow when it was drained into stream in summary our results showed that groundwater was a major contributor to stream discharge at the headwater catchment while at the outlet of the catchment irrigation return flow from rice paddy fields played a new role adding the water components 5 conclusions hydrograph separation is very useful for the study of stream runoff generation processes a three component hydrograph separation technique was applied to investigate the contributions of rainfall soil water and groundwater to the stream discharge in a small agricultural catchment the purposes of the study were to compare streamflow generation patterns between the forest dominated headwater catchment and the wet paddy field dominated downstream catchment emma showed that rainfall and groundwater were the main contributors to stream discharge soil water contributed only 5 during the main peak flow our finding demonstrated that groundwater flow controlled baseflow and was the major contributor to stream discharge in a small headwater forested catchment suggesting that most of the rainfall was stored in the soil during the dry period meanwhile event water and irrigation water were the major contributors to stream discharge in the lower part catchment outlet irrigation water stored in rice paddy fields prior to the stormflow event underwent strong evaporation due to the long period of dry days irrigation return flow had great impacts on stream chemistry and runoff generation in the agricultural watershed and played an important role as a new source the combined use of chemical and isotopic tracers makes evident the addition of a new water source such as irrigation return flow into stream runoff when attempting hydrograph separation analysis for paddy field dominated agricultural watersheds credit authorship contribution statement kwang sik lee conceptualization writing original draft writing

4914,land use change is one of the dominant driving factors of hydrological change at the watershed scale thus understanding the hydrological responses to land use changes can facilitate development of sustainable water resource management the land use of the wei river the largest tributary of the yellow river basin wrb has changed greatly due to the large scale ecological restoration program in the chinese loess plateau e g grain for green program causing dramatic impacts on the water cycle this study was to simulate the impacts of land use and land cover change lucc on the key hydrological components using the soil and water assessment tool swat we investigated the spatiotemporal changes of lucc from 1980 to 2010 in terms of four sub regions i e three subbasins and one mid downstream area and three landforms i e mountain hill and plain respectively then we quantified the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological responses to land use change scenarios our lucc analysis showed that cropland declined by about 0 8 from 58 776 km2 in 1980 to 57 519 km2 in 2010 whereas the forest and grassland areas correspondingly increased 552 km2 and 16 km2 respectively the urban area changed more dramatically in the middle and lower reaches of the wei river owing to the faster socioeconomic development in this region than the rest areas in mountain area the main types of land use were forest and grassland and the main transformation was from cropland to forest land and grassland the area of cropland in plain could be over 50 and it was mainly converted to urban land the hydrological simulation indicated that lucc from 1980 to 2010 caused 5 3 of decrease in the water yield and 6 2 increase in soil water content but there was nearly no change in evapotranspiration et scenarios about slopping land use conversion slc program showed that the conversion of cropland to grassland or forest i e grain for green resulted in negative effects on soil water content and water yield with a greater effect by the reforestation in addition we found that the change of et was clear in areas where cropland with slope 15 was converted to grassland or forest suggesting slope is also an important factor for hydrological responses to lucc this study can provide valuable decision support for land use planning and water resources protection in the wrb keywords et land use change soil water content swat the wei river basin 1 introduction water scarcity is one of the most pervasive problems afflicting people throughout the world jiang 2009 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 problems associated with water are expected to grow worse in the coming decades especially the water shortage in the arid and semi arid regions with wide ranging consequences for human societies and ecosystems conrad et al 2019 shannon et al 2010 wang et al 2019 water availability in river basins are mainly determined by the underlying surface conditions such as soil types terrain slope and plants deng et al 2019 land use activities including the conversion of natural landscapes for human use and the changes of human dominated land management have greatly transformed the global underlying surface fan and shibata 2015 these activities can influence different hydrological processes such as infiltration groundwater recharge et soil water content and water yield foley et al 2005 liu et al 2010 many studies have proved that severe human activities could change the land use patterns thereby affecting water cycle and water resources gentine et al 2012 liu et al 2013 yao et al 2014 thus land use changes and its impacts on hydrology are becoming one of the hottest topics in the global environment change field morán tejeda et al 2010 yang et al 2015 yao et al 2012 nowadays the study about the influence of land use and land cover change lucc on watershed hydrology is attracting an increasing attention and three major methods paired watershed method hydrological characteristics analysis and hydrological modeling were adopted to study hydrological impacts of lucc at different scales such as nation region urban and river basin gwenzi and nyamadzawo 2014 teutschbein and seibert 2012 for hydrological modeling the soil and water assessment tool swat had been proved to be one of the most suitable and efficient models to simulate the hydrological responses to lucc devia et al 2015 wang et al 2014 using an improved swat model zhang et al 2020 found that afforestation in north johnstone river catchment could decrease surface runoff and increase et in addition hydrological model is an effective tool for quantitative assessment of hydrological responses to environmental changes but many previous studies took the watershed as a whole regardless of the spatial heterogeneity of lucc and their impacts as well wang et al 2013 in fact the natural environment conditions and socioeconomic development strategies such as landforms slope and urbanization level could result in the heterogeneity of lucc and the hydrological consequences li and zhou 2014 2015 huang et al 2013 showed that water storage initially rose but then fell sharply with the slope increased from 8 8 to 36 4 using the simulated rainfall experiments definitely a better understanding of hydrological responses to the lucc and their spatial heterogeneity would be greatly helpful for more accurate water resources management and optimization ghaffari et al 2010 the northwest china is one of the most water scarcity region in the world according to statistics the annual average amount of water resources in northwest china only accounts for 5 84 of the national amount chen et al 2014 cheng 2002 with the population growth and fast growing cities and industries northwest china has experienced intensive land use changes cao et al 2009 chen et al 2018 the lucc impacts on the water cycle together with the increasing consumption of water resources due to social development caused the severe water shortage in this area cao et al 2009 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2012a 2012b yin et al 2017 zhai and tao 2017 at the end of the 20th century the government has implemented various soil and water conservation practices to mitigate the insufficient water resources and sever soil erosion in the chinese loess plateau clp feng et al 2016 li et al 2016b zhou et al 2012 as a result this region has experienced significantly changes of land use and hydrological cycle because of human activities wu et al 2014 zhang 2005 it was reported that the vegetation coverage rate of the clp increased from 6 5 in the 1970s to 51 in 2010 because of large scale ecological restoration resulting in a significant decrease in streamflow in the middle yellow river feng et al 2016 leng et al 2016 wang and qin 2017 the wei river basin wrb a typical catchment located in a semi humid and semi arid transition zone in northwest china has experienced dramatic land use and hydrological changes in the past few decades zhao et al 2015 dong et al 2015 found that agricultural land and water body had the greatest effect on direct runoff generation li et al 2018a presented an alternative approach of time varying parameters in swat and found that lucc had significant impacts on the watershed streamflow especially on the streamflow during the dry season the changed hydrological processes by the intensive human activities in the wrb have resulted in ecological problems xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 although there are studies on the impacts of land use change on hydrological processes they mostly focused on the whole basin or a single subbasin without investigating the differences between sub regions and landforms which are very important for hydrological characteristics in fact owing to policies economic development and topographical conditions the sub regions of the wrb have different lucc and hydrological responses spatially table a1 showed that the middle and lower reaches of the wei river mlwr experienced faster urban development than other sub regions although li et al 2016a analyzed the spatial runoff responses to land use change at both yearly and seasonal scales and indicated that the winter runoff decreased in the jing river basin but increased in other basins in the scenario of returning farmland to forest the spatial characteristics of hydrological effects caused by lucc within the wrb is poorly understood therefore it is of importance to assess hydrological responses to heterogeneous lucc for more accurate watershed management peng et al 2013 qiu et al 2011 this study employed an acceptable calibrated and validated physically based swat hydrological model over the wrb aiming to identify responses of hydrological processes to land use scenarios with three periods of lucc over the past thirty years we used four hypothetical land conversion scenarios based on the soil and water conservation practices respectively in terms of four sub regions the upper reach of the wei river uwr the jing river subbasin jr the north luo river subbasin nlr and the mlwr and three landforms mountain hill and plain the specific objectives of this study were to 1 analyze the spatial characteristics of lucc patterns and compare the changes in terms of sub regions and different landforms respectively 2 investigate the spatiotemporal changes of the key hydrological components as a result of lucc and 3 predict the potential effects of the sloping land conversion slc program on the water cycle the results can support policy makers and planners in proposing suitable management practices to reasonably allocate water resources and put forward effective measures in achieving coordinated development of society economy and ecological environment li et al 2015 sun et al 2020 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wei river is the largest tributary of the yellow river the wrb is located in the southeastern part of the clp with a drainage area of 134 800 km2 fig 1 according to the classification system of basic geomorphic types li et al 2008 the wrb was divided into mountains hills and plains accounting for 28 1 30 8 and 41 1 in area respectively fig a1 also we divided the wrb into four sub regions uwr jr nlr and mlwr fig a1 among them the jr and the br are the two large tributaries of the wei river accounting for 34 and 20 of the total area of the wrb based on the past 50 year 1965 2014 hydro climatic data the annual mean temperature t is 9 7 c and the annual mean precipitation and annual runoff depth are 559 mm and 57 mm respectively besides about 78 of precipitation occurs in summer and autumn in the wrb there are three main land use types cropland grassland and forest accounting for 43 6 37 and 16 2 respectively 2 2 data the 90

neitsch et al 2011 the well established swat model has been increasingly used to address numerous watershed issues especially under climate shifts and land use changes based on the dem and digital stream network information the wrb was divided into 196 subbasins and 4 629 hrus using a threshold of 4 5 and 5 for land use soil type and slope respectively 2 4 model calibration and validation the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm was adopted for the parameter optimization the monthly streamflow data were available for 20 years 1971 1990 from which the first ten year 1971 1980 record of monthly streamflow was used to calibrate the model and the other ten year 1981 1990 record was used for validation we used a series of numeric criteria to evaluate the model performance including the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and percentage bias pb more details about model calibration and validation were shown in appendix 1 according to moriasi et al 2007 model performance could be evaluated as satisfactory if nse 0 5 r2 0 5 and pb 25 for monthly simulations 2 5 land use scenarios using three periods of land use data 1980 1995 and 2010 and land use transition matrix method appendix 2 this study reclassified land use into six types cropland forest grassland water urban land and barren to analyze spatial and temporal heterogeneity of lucc in the wrb by these three aspects 1 total land use change 2 land use change in different regions 3 land use change based on landforms to compare the changes in different periods we considered 1980 1995 as the first period and 1995 2010 as the second period besides we assessed the hydrological impacts of changing land use in the past decades and hypothetical sloping land use conversion slc scenarios in space and time 2 5 1 hydrological impacts of changing land use in the past decades we conducted the spatiotemporal analysis of land use change using three land use conditions land use maps from 1980 1995 and 2010 corresponding to s1980 s1995 and s2010 respectively to understand the historical land use change of the wrb the land use of 1980 represented lower human activity the land use of 1995 indicated primary economic developing of rural area and 2010 land use represented result due to urban construction and ecological reconstruction firstly the changes of specific land use types were identified by overlaying the land use maps for different years to isolate the impact of lucc and climate change we fixed the climate data from 1971 to 2015 when we ran the swat model then we assessed the main hydrological components et soil water and water yield under different land use conditions at the hru level 2 5 2 hydrological impacts of hypothetical slopping land use conversion slc program for a long time forest reclamation and improper cultivation caused serious soil erosion one of the counter actions taken by the government to halt the environmental degradation in the clp was the introduction of the slope land conversation program crop conversion program in 1999 stopping agricultural activities in slope areas recovering forest based on principle of suitable land and tree ostwald and chen 2006 the program required that on the basis of stopping cultivation of sloping cropland which was easy to cause soil erosion and desertification appropriate tree species should be selected according to local conditions for afforestation and vegetation restoration to achieve the effect of soil and water conservation and reclamation on steep slope above 25 was prohibited chen et al 2015 based on these policies we divided the slope into the following five levels 0 6 6 15 15 25 25 35 and 35 fig a2 then we set up four hypothetical land conversion scenarios to depict the potential land use pattern scenarios s1 and s2 involved the conversion of cropland on slopes 25 to forest and grassland and scenarios s3 and s4 involved the conversion of cropland on slopes 15 to forest and grassland 3 results 3 1 model performance evaluation a visual and numerical comparison of the simulated monthly streamflow against the observed data during the calibration 1971 1980 and validation 1981 1990 periods was shown in fig 2 the evaluation indicators nse r2 and pb of linjiacun flow gaging station for the uwr were 0 78 0 79 and 3 9 for the calibration and 0 82 0 84 and 7 3 for validation respectively fig 2a according to evaluation criteria for a monthly step nse 0 75 pb 10 and r2 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 the model performance could be rated as very good in both calibration and validation periods the simulation results of zhuangtou fig 2b and huaxian fig 2c were also within an acceptable range according to the above criteria the simulated et in different land use types against the modis et were shown in fig 3 we found that the r2 for cropland forest and grassland were 0 50 0 74 and 0 76 respectively and the pb were no 10 therefore both visual comparison and numerical evaluation demonstrated that the swat model performed well for simulating the hydrological processes in the wrb 3 2 lucc in the wei river basin from 1980 to 2010 3 2 1 total land use change fig a1 showed that the cropland is mainly located in the southeastern part of the basin the grassland is relatively evenly distributed and the forest is mainly distributed in the qinling mountain region and the southern contiguous area of the jing river and the north luo river subbasins farmland grassland and forest were the main land use types table s1 accounting for 96 of the wrb table 2 listed the land use transition matrix in two periods 1980 1995 and 1995 2010 we found that in the first period 1980 1995 cropland was mainly converted into grassland with the conversion area of 16 278 km2 followed by forest and urban land the forest was mainly converted into grassland and cropland with the conversion area of 4874 km2 and 2706 km2 respectively grassland was mainly converted into cropland and forest with conversion area of 16 057 km2 and 4795 km2 respectively the transfer direction between different land use types in the second period 1995 2010 was the same as the first period in addition urban land mainly came from cropland and water and barren mainly turned into cropland and grassland the distribution direction and gravity center of different land use types can reflect the spatial evolution process of the land use change and the transformation characteristics of various land types clearly from the spatial variation map of the wrb fig s1 cropland mainly transferred to the eastern part of the basin during the period of 1980 2010 and its discretization pattern changed slightly forest mainly transferred to the northern part of the basin with a discrete distribution especially in the northern of the wrb and the center of gravity of grassland mainly moved to the northeastern part of the basin as for urban land it mainly shifted to the southeastern part of the wrb and represented a centralized trend 3 2 2 land use change in different sub regions as described previously see section 2 1 we divided the wrb into four sub regions to study the spatial heterogeneity of land use changes fig 1 the main land use types of these four sub regions were cropland forest and grassland fig 4 from fig a1 we found that forest and grassland were mainly distributed in the marginal area of each region cropland was mainly distributed in the low altitude area and urban land was mainly located near the river channel the area of cropland in the uwr was greater than that of grassland and forest and the cropland increased in the first period during 1980 1995 and then decreased during 1995 2010 fig 4a and b in the jing river the area of cropland and grassland was basically equal and the variation of cropland was basically the same with that in the uwr fig 4c and d cropland was mainly distributed around the urban land and on the banks of the jing river and the wei river fig a1 the area of grassland in nlr was obviously greater than that of cropland and forest fig 4e as for mlwr the urban land was obviously greater than that in other three sub regions and the area continued to increase in past 31 years 1980 2010 fig 4g and h in general the area of cropland in all sub regions represented a decreasing trend during 1980 2010 especially in the mlwr the forest both in uwr and mlwr increased first and then decreased the change of grassland area in mlwr was larger than other regions with an increase in the first period and a decrease in the rest besides urban land increased in all sub regions especially in the mlrb which was mainly transferred from cropland table s2 about 1 299 km2 of cropland was converted to urban land during 1995 2010 which was 1 114 km2 during 1980 1995 3 2 3 land use change based on landforms as described previously see section 2 1 we divided the wrb into three landforms i e mountain hill and plain to study the spatial heterogeneity of land use changes fig a1 fig 5 represented the composition of land use area in each of the three landform zones the main types of land use in mountain area were forest and grassland accounting for 70 the cropland and grassland were major land use types both in hill and plain area and the cropland area in plain can be 50 during the 31 year study period the area of forest and urban land among these three parts showed an increasing trend however the area of cropland had an opposite trend especially in the plain area where cropland was mainly converted to forest the major conversion outcome grassland and urban land grassland showed an increasing trend in mountain and plain area because of the conversion of cropland while the grassland of hill showed a decreasing trend because of the conversion of grassland area to forest area table s3 showed the area percentage of three landform conditions in each sub region of the wrb and we found that the topographical features of the uwr was mainly hill the mlwr were mainly mountain and plain area and hill and plain area were the main parts of the jing river and the nlr from fig 6 we found that the area of cropland in the hill of the uwr could be 50 and its area increased first 1980 2010 and then decreased from 1995 to 2010 the proportion of cropland and grassland area in hill and plain of the jing river was larger than other land use types the sum of which was 80 the area of cropland continued to decrease while area of grassland decreased in the first period 1980 1995 and then increased from 1995 to 2010 the area of urban land constantly increased and the growth rate was getting faster during the study period 3 3 hydrological impacts of lucc 3 3 1 hydrological impacts of the past land use changes we fixed the input dem soil data and climate data 1951 2016 for the swat model and got the hydrological results from 1956 to 2016 warm period was 1951 1955 based on land use data for three periods 1980 1995 and 2010 then we processed the annual mean et soil water and water yield on hru level and showed the results in fig 7 based on s1980 s1995 and s2010 we found that the soil water content increased slightly by 6 2 and water yield decreased by 5 3 with the land use change from 1980 to 2010 while et had nearly no change we found that in comparison with the northwestern part the southeastern part of basin had a higher et value which is consistent with the spatial distribution of precipitation compared with 1980 et increased mainly in the north part of wrb in nlr and jing river under the 2010 land use condition higher soil water content was found in the eastern part with an increasing gradient from the west to the east and it decreased in most part of the southern wrb under 2010 land use condition the spatial distribution of water yield indicated that water resources were more abundant in the southern part while less water would be in the nlr and the jing river the comparison between 1980 and 2010 showed that water yield tended to decline in the areas where et increased sharply from table 3 we found that et increased slightly in the nlr and the jing river and soil water content showed an obvious increasing tread in the same regions however the result of water yield was opposite showing a strong decreasing trend this phenomenon was greatly related to the large scale changes of forest because the water consumption of forest was greater than other land use types the afforestation reforestation would reduce streamflow 3 3 2 the sloping land conversion slc program according to the slope land conversation program crop conversion program we set up four scenarios that transformed cropland of 25 and 15 into forest and grassland in mountain hill and plain table 1 we calculated the annual mean hydrological processes in the baseline condition s2010 and four scenarios then we compared the results based on three landforms fig 8 fig 8 showed that the hydrological effects of the conversion of cropland into forest were greater than that of the conversion into grassland the expanding area of the forest and grassland would increase the et because et in both scenarios was greater than that in the baseline period 2010 and et under the conversion of forest scenario was slightly larger than that converted to grassland the consumption of water resources in forest is obviously larger than that in grassland so soil water content under the two scenarios of conversion to forest and grassland was significantly lower than that in the baseline period and soil water content under forest scenario was the lowest forest had a greater effect on reducing water yield than grassland because forest canopy and litter layer have good ability to intercept and conserve water and forest could consume more water than grass consequently forest would significantly reduce streamflow slope also played an important role for hydrological responses to lucc that is the hydrological effects when cropland with slopes 15 was converted into grassland or forest was more significant than with slopes 25 was converted from fig 8a we found that the increase of et of slope 15 was more dramatic that of slope 25 fig 8b showed that soil water content declined by a greater amount in the scenario of slope 15 4 discussion 4 1 driving forces of land use changes in different sub regions and landforms land use change is a direct manifestation of the combination of nature society and ecosystems in earth s critical zone reflecting the intensity of human activities and changes in natural factors over time banwart et al 2013 liu et al 2014 the driving forces of lucc mainly include natural driving factors e g landform and natural disaster and socioeconomic driving forces e g population growth industry development and government behavior dang and kawasaki 2017 liu et al 2010 the natural driving factors are relatively more stable and have cumulative effects and the socioeconomic driving factors are more active with direct impacts on land use change ni 2005 serra et al 2008 xie et al 2014 in the wrb precipitation reduces from southeast to northwest and previous studies have shown that vegetation coverage is positively correlated with precipitation huang et al 2015 we found that cropland was mainly distributed in the mlwr because this region had more precipitation than other three sub regions the forest and grass areas in the nlr located in the eastern part of the wrb was larger than that in the uwr besides some extreme meteorological events can also lead to the changes of land use types several serious droughts in the uwr during 1980 2010 caused many trees to die in the mountainous areas and a certain range of forest was mainly converted into grassland resulting in a decrease in forest and an increase in grassland chang et al 2016 huang et al 2014 in addition the socio economic driving factors played an important role in the spatial heterogeneity of land use change the uwr and jing river are mainly located in gansu province and the nlr and mlwr are mainly located in shaanxi during 1980 1995 china implemented the family contract responsibility system in rural areas leading to the conversion of most grassland and natural forest into cropland cheng et al 2009 zhen et al 2005 therefore the cropland area in the uwr jing river and nlr showed an increasing trend the mlwr as the core area of shaanxi s economy is mainly located in the guanzhong plain during this period the government encouraged urban development causing great progress in urban construction and city size the large scale conversion of cropland into urban land led to an increase in the area of urban land especially in the plain area from 1995 to 2010 with the reform of the rural economic system the market demand for agricultural products tended to be diversified and the production and life of farmers began to shift from the relatively simple production of cultivated land to the diversification of agriculture forestry and animal husbandry li et al 2018b the population growth acceleration of urbanization and implementation of the national policy of the grain for green program after 1998 led to a rapid decline in cropland rapid growth in urban land and different trends in forest and grassland zhang et al 2013 in the nlr the grain for green has been vigorously promoted resulting in the rapid growth of forest area in the mountain area hills and plains wu et al 2014 the rapid growth of forest and the construction of a large number of check dams in the late 1990s have greatly reduced the grassland area he et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 and thus caused the reduction of grassland area in the entire wrb land use has both natural and social attributes and the changes in its use patterns will also have a certain impact on the natural ecological environment and human activities ananda and herath 2008 antipova et al 2011 generally speaking during the periods of 1980 1995 and 1995 2010 the transfer direction of land use was mainly the mutual transformation of cropland forest and grassland compared with other landforms the conversion of cropland mainly occurred in the plains the area of forest and grassland showed a trend of rising in mountain area and hills where the ecological environment was more vulnerable further the vegetation coverage increased significantly which was beneficial to prevent soil erosion in the vulnerable areas it can be seen that the land use pattern of the wrb has been increasingly optimal over the past 30 years which is conducive to the harmonious development of human land relations 4 2 hydrological effects of land use change fig 7 showed that the et under 2010 land use condition was significantly higher than that in 1980 while the water yield was reduced at the same time the changes were particularly obvious in the nlr and jr table 3 this might be because of the increase in area of forest and grassland after the implementation of some soil and water conservation practices under slc scenarios increases in grassland and forest converted from cropland with slop 15 or 25 had positive effects on et and negative effects on soil water and water yield wang et al 2013 found that grass cover types cannot protect the soil surface from solar radiation leading to greater water loss via direct evaporation forest could capture more rainfall and uptake more water than other land use types e g cropland resulting in a lower water yield crockford and richardson 2000 li et al 2017 this result was similar with yang and lu 2018 who found that the grain for green programme reduced the runoff by 13 8 and the sediment load by 50 7 in yanhe river basin however li et al 2018a showed that the shrinkage of woodland would cause decrease of soil water thus contributing to a small increase in streamflow during the dry season in the wrb the hydrological effects of conversion of cropland into forest were greater than those of grassland compared with grassland the large canopy big leaf area and deep root of forest would result in greater et qubaja et al 2020 wang 2000 besides canopy interception and root water absorption could lead to more reduction of soil water in the forest land marimon junior et al 2020 nepstad et al 1994 jia et al 2017 collected soil moisture content data within the 5 m soil profile and found that artificial forests intensified soil moisture decline on the loess plateau inducing dry soil layer formation such type of land use shift would reduce water yield streamflow in forest area therefore forest might lose more water through et compared with other land use types wang et al 2011 this pattern was evident from the change in soil water content with less amount in forest than in other areas four slc scenarios were proposed to demonstrate the hydrological impacts of land use change under the land conversion from farmland with slope 15 or 25 to grassland forest there was a negative impact on soil water and water yield and a positive impact on et additionally after the ggp was implemented the area with steep slope has less obvious changes of et than areas with gentle slope thus besides the variability of climate and soil topographic factors also played important roles in the spatial heterogeneity of the water balance luo et al 2020 reggiani et al 2000 combined swat and water energy coupling framework to detect the hydrology heterogeneity yang et al 2019 found that the contribution of land surface change on hydrology shifts in the arid alpine region of heihe river basin was gradually increasing because of the strengthening effect of land surface change previous studies have found that revegetation can cause soil water shortages in both the near surface soil and deep soil layers which might result in soil desiccation feng et al 2016 jia and shao 2013 jian et al 2015 vegetation restoration plays an important role in prolonging concentration time and reducing water yield on the hillslopes jia et al 2020 from an artificial rainfall experiment gu et al 2020 found that vegetation cover the decrease in soil bulk density and the increase in belowground root biomass were the primary causes of runoff and sediment yield reduction on the slopes with vegetation restoration consequently watershed management should consider all hydrological components and optimize vegetative structure and management measures in order to improve hydrological functions and promote sustainable development in terms of socioeconomics and ecology 4 3 limitations and uncertainties this study is subjected to some limitations that need to be resolved in future work on the one hand the grid resolution of land use data was 1 km which might be coarse for identifying land use conversion and detecting hydrological responses therefore the problem of land use data may bring some uncertainties in assessing lucc and their hydrological consequences mukundan et al 2010 found that different data resolutions would affect the delineation of hrus and sediment and nutrient predictions using swat on the other hand the internal structure of the model determines that some simulations are biased the simulated streamflow showed some deviation in the flood season which may be related to the measurement quality and model behavior reasons for example swat uses total daily precipitation and does not consider rainfall intensity within a day thus it may underestimate streamflow for some precipitation events qiu et al 2017 also the use of runoff curve number to simulate the surface runoff behavior dose not account for saturation excess runoff or contributions from variable source areas easton et al 2008 in brief the limitations mentioned above might compromise the results of our study however the methodology and data used in our study can definitely be accepted and support our conclusions nonetheless addressing these limitations by comparing different datasets and different models can be a good subject of future studies 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the spatial heterogeneity of lucc from 1980 to 2010 and its impacts on key hydrological components in the wrb the swat model performed satisfactorily with acceptable nse r2 and pbias values the lucc analysis results showed that cropland forest grassland were the dominant land use types in study area the cropland exhibited a decreasing trend from 58 776 km2 in 1980 to 57 519 km2 in 2010 leading to an increase in forest grassland and urban land among four sub regions the cropland reduced most obviously in uwr with a decrease of 498 km2 the grassland area decreased in the uwr and the nlr but increased in the jing river and the mlwr different landform conditions also affected the distribution and transformation of land use the main types of land use in mountain area were forest and grassland and the main transformation was from cropland to forest land and grassland the area of cropland in plain could be over 50 and it was mainly converted to urban land based on the analysis of the characteristics and driving factors of land use dynamic change in 1980 1995 and 1995 2010 we found that the lucc in the two stages showed different characteristics because of different driving forces and the change degree in the latter stage was greater than that in the previous stage the impacts of lucc on the water balance components were assessed quantitatively using swat setting scenarios with three periods of lucc over the past thirty years and four hypothetical land conversion scenarios based on the soil and water conservation practices our analysis showed that the soil water content increased slightly by 6 2 and the water yield decreased by 5 3 for 2010 when compared to 1980 the water yield in nlr and jing river declined obviously by 18 9 and 10 4 respectively though the et had nearly no change in terms of the spatial analysis et increased significantly in the north part of wrb mainly in the nlr and the jing river and the decline of water yield was more severe in the same area the scenarios about slc program showed that the conversion of cropland to grassland or forest exerted negative effects on soil water and water yield and the negative effects were more evident in the scenario of afforestation the conversion of land use types with different slopes also had different hydrological effects we found that the function of increasing et was more effective when cropland with slopes 15 was converted into grassland or forest than with slopes 25 was converted in summary this study provided useful information for land use planning and soil and water conservation on the loess platea the quantitative assessment of lucc and their impacts on hydrology can provide valuable information for optimization of land use planning soil and water conservation and the eventual sustainable watershed management on the loess

4914,land use change is one of the dominant driving factors of hydrological change at the watershed scale thus understanding the hydrological responses to land use changes can facilitate development of sustainable water resource management the land use of the wei river the largest tributary of the yellow river basin wrb has changed greatly due to the large scale ecological restoration program in the chinese loess plateau e g grain for green program causing dramatic impacts on the water cycle this study was to simulate the impacts of land use and land cover change lucc on the key hydrological components using the soil and water assessment tool swat we investigated the spatiotemporal changes of lucc from 1980 to 2010 in terms of four sub regions i e three subbasins and one mid downstream area and three landforms i e mountain hill and plain respectively then we quantified the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological responses to land use change scenarios our lucc analysis showed that cropland declined by about 0 8 from 58 776 km2 in 1980 to 57 519 km2 in 2010 whereas the forest and grassland areas correspondingly increased 552 km2 and 16 km2 respectively the urban area changed more dramatically in the middle and lower reaches of the wei river owing to the faster socioeconomic development in this region than the rest areas in mountain area the main types of land use were forest and grassland and the main transformation was from cropland to forest land and grassland the area of cropland in plain could be over 50 and it was mainly converted to urban land the hydrological simulation indicated that lucc from 1980 to 2010 caused 5 3 of decrease in the water yield and 6 2 increase in soil water content but there was nearly no change in evapotranspiration et scenarios about slopping land use conversion slc program showed that the conversion of cropland to grassland or forest i e grain for green resulted in negative effects on soil water content and water yield with a greater effect by the reforestation in addition we found that the change of et was clear in areas where cropland with slope 15 was converted to grassland or forest suggesting slope is also an important factor for hydrological responses to lucc this study can provide valuable decision support for land use planning and water resources protection in the wrb keywords et land use change soil water content swat the wei river basin 1 introduction water scarcity is one of the most pervasive problems afflicting people throughout the world jiang 2009 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 problems associated with water are expected to grow worse in the coming decades especially the water shortage in the arid and semi arid regions with wide ranging consequences for human societies and ecosystems conrad et al 2019 shannon et al 2010 wang et al 2019 water availability in river basins are mainly determined by the underlying surface conditions such as soil types terrain slope and plants deng et al 2019 land use activities including the conversion of natural landscapes for human use and the changes of human dominated land management have greatly transformed the global underlying surface fan and shibata 2015 these activities can influence different hydrological processes such as infiltration groundwater recharge et soil water content and water yield foley et al 2005 liu et al 2010 many studies have proved that severe human activities could change the land use patterns thereby affecting water cycle and water resources gentine et al 2012 liu et al 2013 yao et al 2014 thus land use changes and its impacts on hydrology are becoming one of the hottest topics in the global environment change field morán tejeda et al 2010 yang et al 2015 yao et al 2012 nowadays the study about the influence of land use and land cover change lucc on watershed hydrology is attracting an increasing attention and three major methods paired watershed method hydrological characteristics analysis and hydrological modeling were adopted to study hydrological impacts of lucc at different scales such as nation region urban and river basin gwenzi and nyamadzawo 2014 teutschbein and seibert 2012 for hydrological modeling the soil and water assessment tool swat had been proved to be one of the most suitable and efficient models to simulate the hydrological responses to lucc devia et al 2015 wang et al 2014 using an improved swat model zhang et al 2020 found that afforestation in north johnstone river catchment could decrease surface runoff and increase et in addition hydrological model is an effective tool for quantitative assessment of hydrological responses to environmental changes but many previous studies took the watershed as a whole regardless of the spatial heterogeneity of lucc and their impacts as well wang et al 2013 in fact the natural environment conditions and socioeconomic development strategies such as landforms slope and urbanization level could result in the heterogeneity of lucc and the hydrological consequences li and zhou 2014 2015 huang et al 2013 showed that water storage initially rose but then fell sharply with the slope increased from 8 8 to 36 4 using the simulated rainfall experiments definitely a better understanding of hydrological responses to the lucc and their spatial heterogeneity would be greatly helpful for more accurate water resources management and optimization ghaffari et al 2010 the northwest china is one of the most water scarcity region in the world according to statistics the annual average amount of water resources in northwest china only accounts for 5 84 of the national amount chen et al 2014 cheng 2002 with the population growth and fast growing cities and industries northwest china has experienced intensive land use changes cao et al 2009 chen et al 2018 the lucc impacts on the water cycle together with the increasing consumption of water resources due to social development caused the severe water shortage in this area cao et al 2009 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2012a 2012b yin et al 2017 zhai and tao 2017 at the end of the 20th century the government has implemented various soil and water conservation practices to mitigate the insufficient water resources and sever soil erosion in the chinese loess plateau clp feng et al 2016 li et al 2016b zhou et al 2012 as a result this region has experienced significantly changes of land use and hydrological cycle because of human activities wu et al 2014 zhang 2005 it was reported that the vegetation coverage rate of the clp increased from 6 5 in the 1970s to 51 in 2010 because of large scale ecological restoration resulting in a significant decrease in streamflow in the middle yellow river feng et al 2016 leng et al 2016 wang and qin 2017 the wei river basin wrb a typical catchment located in a semi humid and semi arid transition zone in northwest china has experienced dramatic land use and hydrological changes in the past few decades zhao et al 2015 dong et al 2015 found that agricultural land and water body had the greatest effect on direct runoff generation li et al 2018a presented an alternative approach of time varying parameters in swat and found that lucc had significant impacts on the watershed streamflow especially on the streamflow during the dry season the changed hydrological processes by the intensive human activities in the wrb have resulted in ecological problems xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 although there are studies on the impacts of land use change on hydrological processes they mostly focused on the whole basin or a single subbasin without investigating the differences between sub regions and landforms which are very important for hydrological characteristics in fact owing to policies economic development and topographical conditions the sub regions of the wrb have different lucc and hydrological responses spatially table a1 showed that the middle and lower reaches of the wei river mlwr experienced faster urban development than other sub regions although li et al 2016a analyzed the spatial runoff responses to land use change at both yearly and seasonal scales and indicated that the winter runoff decreased in the jing river basin but increased in other basins in the scenario of returning farmland to forest the spatial characteristics of hydrological effects caused by lucc within the wrb is poorly understood therefore it is of importance to assess hydrological responses to heterogeneous lucc for more accurate watershed management peng et al 2013 qiu et al 2011 this study employed an acceptable calibrated and validated physically based swat hydrological model over the wrb aiming to identify responses of hydrological processes to land use scenarios with three periods of lucc over the past thirty years we used four hypothetical land conversion scenarios based on the soil and water conservation practices respectively in terms of four sub regions the upper reach of the wei river uwr the jing river subbasin jr the north luo river subbasin nlr and the mlwr and three landforms mountain hill and plain the specific objectives of this study were to 1 analyze the spatial characteristics of lucc patterns and compare the changes in terms of sub regions and different landforms respectively 2 investigate the spatiotemporal changes of the key hydrological components as a result of lucc and 3 predict the potential effects of the sloping land conversion slc program on the water cycle the results can support policy makers and planners in proposing suitable management practices to reasonably allocate water resources and put forward effective measures in achieving coordinated development of society economy and ecological environment li et al 2015 sun et al 2020 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wei river is the largest tributary of the yellow river the wrb is located in the southeastern part of the clp with a drainage area of 134 800 km2 fig 1 according to the classification system of basic geomorphic types li et al 2008 the wrb was divided into mountains hills and plains accounting for 28 1 30 8 and 41 1 in area respectively fig a1 also we divided the wrb into four sub regions uwr jr nlr and mlwr fig a1 among them the jr and the br are the two large tributaries of the wei river accounting for 34 and 20 of the total area of the wrb based on the past 50 year 1965 2014 hydro climatic data the annual mean temperature t is 9 7 c and the annual mean precipitation and annual runoff depth are 559 mm and 57 mm respectively besides about 78 of precipitation occurs in summer and autumn in the wrb there are three main land use types cropland grassland and forest accounting for 43 6 37 and 16 2 respectively 2 2 data the 90

neitsch et al 2011 the well established swat model has been increasingly used to address numerous watershed issues especially under climate shifts and land use changes based on the dem and digital stream network information the wrb was divided into 196 subbasins and 4 629 hrus using a threshold of 4 5 and 5 for land use soil type and slope respectively 2 4 model calibration and validation the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm was adopted for the parameter optimization the monthly streamflow data were available for 20 years 1971 1990 from which the first ten year 1971 1980 record of monthly streamflow was used to calibrate the model and the other ten year 1981 1990 record was used for validation we used a series of numeric criteria to evaluate the model performance including the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and percentage bias pb more details about model calibration and validation were shown in appendix 1 according to moriasi et al 2007 model performance could be evaluated as satisfactory if nse 0 5 r2 0 5 and pb 25 for monthly simulations 2 5 land use scenarios using three periods of land use data 1980 1995 and 2010 and land use transition matrix method appendix 2 this study reclassified land use into six types cropland forest grassland water urban land and barren to analyze spatial and temporal heterogeneity of lucc in the wrb by these three aspects 1 total land use change 2 land use change in different regions 3 land use change based on landforms to compare the changes in different periods we considered 1980 1995 as the first period and 1995 2010 as the second period besides we assessed the hydrological impacts of changing land use in the past decades and hypothetical sloping land use conversion slc scenarios in space and time 2 5 1 hydrological impacts of changing land use in the past decades we conducted the spatiotemporal analysis of land use change using three land use conditions land use maps from 1980 1995 and 2010 corresponding to s1980 s1995 and s2010 respectively to understand the historical land use change of the wrb the land use of 1980 represented lower human activity the land use of 1995 indicated primary economic developing of rural area and 2010 land use represented result due to urban construction and ecological reconstruction firstly the changes of specific land use types were identified by overlaying the land use maps for different years to isolate the impact of lucc and climate change we fixed the climate data from 1971 to 2015 when we ran the swat model then we assessed the main hydrological components et soil water and water yield under different land use conditions at the hru level 2 5 2 hydrological impacts of hypothetical slopping land use conversion slc program for a long time forest reclamation and improper cultivation caused serious soil erosion one of the counter actions taken by the government to halt the environmental degradation in the clp was the introduction of the slope land conversation program crop conversion program in 1999 stopping agricultural activities in slope areas recovering forest based on principle of suitable land and tree ostwald and chen 2006 the program required that on the basis of stopping cultivation of sloping cropland which was easy to cause soil erosion and desertification appropriate tree species should be selected according to local conditions for afforestation and vegetation restoration to achieve the effect of soil and water conservation and reclamation on steep slope above 25 was prohibited chen et al 2015 based on these policies we divided the slope into the following five levels 0 6 6 15 15 25 25 35 and 35 fig a2 then we set up four hypothetical land conversion scenarios to depict the potential land use pattern scenarios s1 and s2 involved the conversion of cropland on slopes 25 to forest and grassland and scenarios s3 and s4 involved the conversion of cropland on slopes 15 to forest and grassland 3 results 3 1 model performance evaluation a visual and numerical comparison of the simulated monthly streamflow against the observed data during the calibration 1971 1980 and validation 1981 1990 periods was shown in fig 2 the evaluation indicators nse r2 and pb of linjiacun flow gaging station for the uwr were 0 78 0 79 and 3 9 for the calibration and 0 82 0 84 and 7 3 for validation respectively fig 2a according to evaluation criteria for a monthly step nse 0 75 pb 10 and r2 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 the model performance could be rated as very good in both calibration and validation periods the simulation results of zhuangtou fig 2b and huaxian fig 2c were also within an acceptable range according to the above criteria the simulated et in different land use types against the modis et were shown in fig 3 we found that the r2 for cropland forest and grassland were 0 50 0 74 and 0 76 respectively and the pb were no 10 therefore both visual comparison and numerical evaluation demonstrated that the swat model performed well for simulating the hydrological processes in the wrb 3 2 lucc in the wei river basin from 1980 to 2010 3 2 1 total land use change fig a1 showed that the cropland is mainly located in the southeastern part of the basin the grassland is relatively evenly distributed and the forest is mainly distributed in the qinling mountain region and the southern contiguous area of the jing river and the north luo river subbasins farmland grassland and forest were the main land use types table s1 accounting for 96 of the wrb table 2 listed the land use transition matrix in two periods 1980 1995 and 1995 2010 we found that in the first period 1980 1995 cropland was mainly converted into grassland with the conversion area of 16 278 km2 followed by forest and urban land the forest was mainly converted into grassland and cropland with the conversion area of 4874 km2 and 2706 km2 respectively grassland was mainly converted into cropland and forest with conversion area of 16 057 km2 and 4795 km2 respectively the transfer direction between different land use types in the second period 1995 2010 was the same as the first period in addition urban land mainly came from cropland and water and barren mainly turned into cropland and grassland the distribution direction and gravity center of different land use types can reflect the spatial evolution process of the land use change and the transformation characteristics of various land types clearly from the spatial variation map of the wrb fig s1 cropland mainly transferred to the eastern part of the basin during the period of 1980 2010 and its discretization pattern changed slightly forest mainly transferred to the northern part of the basin with a discrete distribution especially in the northern of the wrb and the center of gravity of grassland mainly moved to the northeastern part of the basin as for urban land it mainly shifted to the southeastern part of the wrb and represented a centralized trend 3 2 2 land use change in different sub regions as described previously see section 2 1 we divided the wrb into four sub regions to study the spatial heterogeneity of land use changes fig 1 the main land use types of these four sub regions were cropland forest and grassland fig 4 from fig a1 we found that forest and grassland were mainly distributed in the marginal area of each region cropland was mainly distributed in the low altitude area and urban land was mainly located near the river channel the area of cropland in the uwr was greater than that of grassland and forest and the cropland increased in the first period during 1980 1995 and then decreased during 1995 2010 fig 4a and b in the jing river the area of cropland and grassland was basically equal and the variation of cropland was basically the same with that in the uwr fig 4c and d cropland was mainly distributed around the urban land and on the banks of the jing river and the wei river fig a1 the area of grassland in nlr was obviously greater than that of cropland and forest fig 4e as for mlwr the urban land was obviously greater than that in other three sub regions and the area continued to increase in past 31 years 1980 2010 fig 4g and h in general the area of cropland in all sub regions represented a decreasing trend during 1980 2010 especially in the mlwr the forest both in uwr and mlwr increased first and then decreased the change of grassland area in mlwr was larger than other regions with an increase in the first period and a decrease in the rest besides urban land increased in all sub regions especially in the mlrb which was mainly transferred from cropland table s2 about 1 299 km2 of cropland was converted to urban land during 1995 2010 which was 1 114 km2 during 1980 1995 3 2 3 land use change based on landforms as described previously see section 2 1 we divided the wrb into three landforms i e mountain hill and plain to study the spatial heterogeneity of land use changes fig a1 fig 5 represented the composition of land use area in each of the three landform zones the main types of land use in mountain area were forest and grassland accounting for 70 the cropland and grassland were major land use types both in hill and plain area and the cropland area in plain can be 50 during the 31 year study period the area of forest and urban land among these three parts showed an increasing trend however the area of cropland had an opposite trend especially in the plain area where cropland was mainly converted to forest the major conversion outcome grassland and urban land grassland showed an increasing trend in mountain and plain area because of the conversion of cropland while the grassland of hill showed a decreasing trend because of the conversion of grassland area to forest area table s3 showed the area percentage of three landform conditions in each sub region of the wrb and we found that the topographical features of the uwr was mainly hill the mlwr were mainly mountain and plain area and hill and plain area were the main parts of the jing river and the nlr from fig 6 we found that the area of cropland in the hill of the uwr could be 50 and its area increased first 1980 2010 and then decreased from 1995 to 2010 the proportion of cropland and grassland area in hill and plain of the jing river was larger than other land use types the sum of which was 80 the area of cropland continued to decrease while area of grassland decreased in the first period 1980 1995 and then increased from 1995 to 2010 the area of urban land constantly increased and the growth rate was getting faster during the study period 3 3 hydrological impacts of lucc 3 3 1 hydrological impacts of the past land use changes we fixed the input dem soil data and climate data 1951 2016 for the swat model and got the hydrological results from 1956 to 2016 warm period was 1951 1955 based on land use data for three periods 1980 1995 and 2010 then we processed the annual mean et soil water and water yield on hru level and showed the results in fig 7 based on s1980 s1995 and s2010 we found that the soil water content increased slightly by 6 2 and water yield decreased by 5 3 with the land use change from 1980 to 2010 while et had nearly no change we found that in comparison with the northwestern part the southeastern part of basin had a higher et value which is consistent with the spatial distribution of precipitation compared with 1980 et increased mainly in the north part of wrb in nlr and jing river under the 2010 land use condition higher soil water content was found in the eastern part with an increasing gradient from the west to the east and it decreased in most part of the southern wrb under 2010 land use condition the spatial distribution of water yield indicated that water resources were more abundant in the southern part while less water would be in the nlr and the jing river the comparison between 1980 and 2010 showed that water yield tended to decline in the areas where et increased sharply from table 3 we found that et increased slightly in the nlr and the jing river and soil water content showed an obvious increasing tread in the same regions however the result of water yield was opposite showing a strong decreasing trend this phenomenon was greatly related to the large scale changes of forest because the water consumption of forest was greater than other land use types the afforestation reforestation would reduce streamflow 3 3 2 the sloping land conversion slc program according to the slope land conversation program crop conversion program we set up four scenarios that transformed cropland of 25 and 15 into forest and grassland in mountain hill and plain table 1 we calculated the annual mean hydrological processes in the baseline condition s2010 and four scenarios then we compared the results based on three landforms fig 8 fig 8 showed that the hydrological effects of the conversion of cropland into forest were greater than that of the conversion into grassland the expanding area of the forest and grassland would increase the et because et in both scenarios was greater than that in the baseline period 2010 and et under the conversion of forest scenario was slightly larger than that converted to grassland the consumption of water resources in forest is obviously larger than that in grassland so soil water content under the two scenarios of conversion to forest and grassland was significantly lower than that in the baseline period and soil water content under forest scenario was the lowest forest had a greater effect on reducing water yield than grassland because forest canopy and litter layer have good ability to intercept and conserve water and forest could consume more water than grass consequently forest would significantly reduce streamflow slope also played an important role for hydrological responses to lucc that is the hydrological effects when cropland with slopes 15 was converted into grassland or forest was more significant than with slopes 25 was converted from fig 8a we found that the increase of et of slope 15 was more dramatic that of slope 25 fig 8b showed that soil water content declined by a greater amount in the scenario of slope 15 4 discussion 4 1 driving forces of land use changes in different sub regions and landforms land use change is a direct manifestation of the combination of nature society and ecosystems in earth s critical zone reflecting the intensity of human activities and changes in natural factors over time banwart et al 2013 liu et al 2014 the driving forces of lucc mainly include natural driving factors e g landform and natural disaster and socioeconomic driving forces e g population growth industry development and government behavior dang and kawasaki 2017 liu et al 2010 the natural driving factors are relatively more stable and have cumulative effects and the socioeconomic driving factors are more active with direct impacts on land use change ni 2005 serra et al 2008 xie et al 2014 in the wrb precipitation reduces from southeast to northwest and previous studies have shown that vegetation coverage is positively correlated with precipitation huang et al 2015 we found that cropland was mainly distributed in the mlwr because this region had more precipitation than other three sub regions the forest and grass areas in the nlr located in the eastern part of the wrb was larger than that in the uwr besides some extreme meteorological events can also lead to the changes of land use types several serious droughts in the uwr during 1980 2010 caused many trees to die in the mountainous areas and a certain range of forest was mainly converted into grassland resulting in a decrease in forest and an increase in grassland chang et al 2016 huang et al 2014 in addition the socio economic driving factors played an important role in the spatial heterogeneity of land use change the uwr and jing river are mainly located in gansu province and the nlr and mlwr are mainly located in shaanxi during 1980 1995 china implemented the family contract responsibility system in rural areas leading to the conversion of most grassland and natural forest into cropland cheng et al 2009 zhen et al 2005 therefore the cropland area in the uwr jing river and nlr showed an increasing trend the mlwr as the core area of shaanxi s economy is mainly located in the guanzhong plain during this period the government encouraged urban development causing great progress in urban construction and city size the large scale conversion of cropland into urban land led to an increase in the area of urban land especially in the plain area from 1995 to 2010 with the reform of the rural economic system the market demand for agricultural products tended to be diversified and the production and life of farmers began to shift from the relatively simple production of cultivated land to the diversification of agriculture forestry and animal husbandry li et al 2018b the population growth acceleration of urbanization and implementation of the national policy of the grain for green program after 1998 led to a rapid decline in cropland rapid growth in urban land and different trends in forest and grassland zhang et al 2013 in the nlr the grain for green has been vigorously promoted resulting in the rapid growth of forest area in the mountain area hills and plains wu et al 2014 the rapid growth of forest and the construction of a large number of check dams in the late 1990s have greatly reduced the grassland area he et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 and thus caused the reduction of grassland area in the entire wrb land use has both natural and social attributes and the changes in its use patterns will also have a certain impact on the natural ecological environment and human activities ananda and herath 2008 antipova et al 2011 generally speaking during the periods of 1980 1995 and 1995 2010 the transfer direction of land use was mainly the mutual transformation of cropland forest and grassland compared with other landforms the conversion of cropland mainly occurred in the plains the area of forest and grassland showed a trend of rising in mountain area and hills where the ecological environment was more vulnerable further the vegetation coverage increased significantly which was beneficial to prevent soil erosion in the vulnerable areas it can be seen that the land use pattern of the wrb has been increasingly optimal over the past 30 years which is conducive to the harmonious development of human land relations 4 2 hydrological effects of land use change fig 7 showed that the et under 2010 land use condition was significantly higher than that in 1980 while the water yield was reduced at the same time the changes were particularly obvious in the nlr and jr table 3 this might be because of the increase in area of forest and grassland after the implementation of some soil and water conservation practices under slc scenarios increases in grassland and forest converted from cropland with slop 15 or 25 had positive effects on et and negative effects on soil water and water yield wang et al 2013 found that grass cover types cannot protect the soil surface from solar radiation leading to greater water loss via direct evaporation forest could capture more rainfall and uptake more water than other land use types e g cropland resulting in a lower water yield crockford and richardson 2000 li et al 2017 this result was similar with yang and lu 2018 who found that the grain for green programme reduced the runoff by 13 8 and the sediment load by 50 7 in yanhe river basin however li et al 2018a showed that the shrinkage of woodland would cause decrease of soil water thus contributing to a small increase in streamflow during the dry season in the wrb the hydrological effects of conversion of cropland into forest were greater than those of grassland compared with grassland the large canopy big leaf area and deep root of forest would result in greater et qubaja et al 2020 wang 2000 besides canopy interception and root water absorption could lead to more reduction of soil water in the forest land marimon junior et al 2020 nepstad et al 1994 jia et al 2017 collected soil moisture content data within the 5 m soil profile and found that artificial forests intensified soil moisture decline on the loess plateau inducing dry soil layer formation such type of land use shift would reduce water yield streamflow in forest area therefore forest might lose more water through et compared with other land use types wang et al 2011 this pattern was evident from the change in soil water content with less amount in forest than in other areas four slc scenarios were proposed to demonstrate the hydrological impacts of land use change under the land conversion from farmland with slope 15 or 25 to grassland forest there was a negative impact on soil water and water yield and a positive impact on et additionally after the ggp was implemented the area with steep slope has less obvious changes of et than areas with gentle slope thus besides the variability of climate and soil topographic factors also played important roles in the spatial heterogeneity of the water balance luo et al 2020 reggiani et al 2000 combined swat and water energy coupling framework to detect the hydrology heterogeneity yang et al 2019 found that the contribution of land surface change on hydrology shifts in the arid alpine region of heihe river basin was gradually increasing because of the strengthening effect of land surface change previous studies have found that revegetation can cause soil water shortages in both the near surface soil and deep soil layers which might result in soil desiccation feng et al 2016 jia and shao 2013 jian et al 2015 vegetation restoration plays an important role in prolonging concentration time and reducing water yield on the hillslopes jia et al 2020 from an artificial rainfall experiment gu et al 2020 found that vegetation cover the decrease in soil bulk density and the increase in belowground root biomass were the primary causes of runoff and sediment yield reduction on the slopes with vegetation restoration consequently watershed management should consider all hydrological components and optimize vegetative structure and management measures in order to improve hydrological functions and promote sustainable development in terms of socioeconomics and ecology 4 3 limitations and uncertainties this study is subjected to some limitations that need to be resolved in future work on the one hand the grid resolution of land use data was 1 km which might be coarse for identifying land use conversion and detecting hydrological responses therefore the problem of land use data may bring some uncertainties in assessing lucc and their hydrological consequences mukundan et al 2010 found that different data resolutions would affect the delineation of hrus and sediment and nutrient predictions using swat on the other hand the internal structure of the model determines that some simulations are biased the simulated streamflow showed some deviation in the flood season which may be related to the measurement quality and model behavior reasons for example swat uses total daily precipitation and does not consider rainfall intensity within a day thus it may underestimate streamflow for some precipitation events qiu et al 2017 also the use of runoff curve number to simulate the surface runoff behavior dose not account for saturation excess runoff or contributions from variable source areas easton et al 2008 in brief the limitations mentioned above might compromise the results of our study however the methodology and data used in our study can definitely be accepted and support our conclusions nonetheless addressing these limitations by comparing different datasets and different models can be a good subject of future studies 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the spatial heterogeneity of lucc from 1980 to 2010 and its impacts on key hydrological components in the wrb the swat model performed satisfactorily with acceptable nse r2 and pbias values the lucc analysis results showed that cropland forest grassland were the dominant land use types in study area the cropland exhibited a decreasing trend from 58 776 km2 in 1980 to 57 519 km2 in 2010 leading to an increase in forest grassland and urban land among four sub regions the cropland reduced most obviously in uwr with a decrease of 498 km2 the grassland area decreased in the uwr and the nlr but increased in the jing river and the mlwr different landform conditions also affected the distribution and transformation of land use the main types of land use in mountain area were forest and grassland and the main transformation was from cropland to forest land and grassland the area of cropland in plain could be over 50 and it was mainly converted to urban land based on the analysis of the characteristics and driving factors of land use dynamic change in 1980 1995 and 1995 2010 we found that the lucc in the two stages showed different characteristics because of different driving forces and the change degree in the latter stage was greater than that in the previous stage the impacts of lucc on the water balance components were assessed quantitatively using swat setting scenarios with three periods of lucc over the past thirty years and four hypothetical land conversion scenarios based on the soil and water conservation practices our analysis showed that the soil water content increased slightly by 6 2 and the water yield decreased by 5 3 for 2010 when compared to 1980 the water yield in nlr and jing river declined obviously by 18 9 and 10 4 respectively though the et had nearly no change in terms of the spatial analysis et increased significantly in the north part of wrb mainly in the nlr and the jing river and the decline of water yield was more severe in the same area the scenarios about slc program showed that the conversion of cropland to grassland or forest exerted negative effects on soil water and water yield and the negative effects were more evident in the scenario of afforestation the conversion of land use types with different slopes also had different hydrological effects we found that the function of increasing et was more effective when cropland with slopes 15 was converted into grassland or forest than with slopes 25 was converted in summary this study provided useful information for land use planning and soil and water conservation on the loess platea the quantitative assessment of lucc and their impacts on hydrology can provide valuable information for optimization of land use planning soil and water conservation and the eventual sustainable watershed management on the loess

between observation and simulation the closer nse and r2 are to 1 and pbias to 0 the better the swat model performs appendix 2 land use transition matrix land use transition matrix is a fundamental tool in analyses of land use change it includes not only the static information of land use types in a certain period but also the dynamic conversion information of various land use types at the beginning and end of the period which can better show the transition of land use types mas et al 2004 the mathematical expression of the transition matrix is as follows 4 s ij s 11 s 12 s 21 s 22 s 1
