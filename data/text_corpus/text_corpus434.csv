2170,extreme events on the tibetan plateau tp have become increasingly frequent and severe in recent decades in tandem with rapid climate warming and moistening thus it is highly important to investigate their processes causes and environmental impacts using in situ observations of lake level changes in combination with satellite altimetry data we showed that lakes on the central tp ctp expanded unprecedentedly in 2017 2018 with lake level increases of 1 4 2 8 m at the five observed lakes this extreme lake expansion occurred over almost the entire inner tp which was mainly attributed to anomalously high precipitation approximately 43 97 higher in 2017 2018 than in normal years on the ctp the rapid lake expansion posed a substantial threat to regional ecosystems infrastructure and even residential habitats therefore it is necessary to identify the potential sites threatened by lake expansion on the tp using high resolution satellite images and perform near real time observations of lake level changes through satellite and in situ observations keywords lake expansion tibetan plateau environmental impacts climate extremes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction under climate warming extreme events such as heatwaves heavy rainfall snowstorms droughts and floods are becoming increasingly frequent and severe these extreme events have caused substantial losses of life as well as incurred tremendous economic costs easterling et al 2000 extreme events are governed by prevailing weather systems on shorter timescales and by modes of climate variability acting on the background states on longer timescales perkins kirkpatrick and pitman 2018 basconcillo et al 2021 for example el niňo is generally responsible for droughts whereas la niňa has a large influence on extreme rainfall with the opposite phases extreme precipitation events are expected to intensify under climate change with consequent impacts on flooding and ecosystem functions moustakis et al 2021 the tibetan plateau tp and its surroundings which function as the asian water tower are experiencing rapid climate change the annual mean air temperature on the tp rose rapidly at a rate of 0 35 10 yr between 1970 and 2014 which is approximately twice the global average chen et al 2015 changes in precipitation exhibited significant heterogeneity with a considerable increase on the inner tp and a decrease on the south and east tp peripheries yang et al 2014 climate warming has led to remarkable changes in cryosphere on the tp including glacier retreat decrease in snow cover degradation of permafrost and thickening of the active layer yao et al 2019 hydrological projections under future climate change suggest that streamflow in most river source regions will increase along with precipitation and ice snow melting and hydrological extremes such as flooding will occur increasingly frequently tang et al 2019 the tp boasts the greatest concentration of high altitude lakes in the world lake dynamics on the tp have been investigated over the last decade using satellite images or altimetry data e g hwang et al 2005 bian et al 2010 ma et al 2011 li et al 2014 icesat altimetry data showed that lake levels on the interior tp increased at an average rate of 0 20 m yr in 2003 2009 and at an average rate of 0 30 m yr in 2003 2018 zhang et al 2011 2019 song et al 2014 lake expansion led to changes in lake morphology geomorphology and the hydrological connection between rivers and lakes as well as exerted a profound influence on residential habitats and infrastructure for example drainage reorganization occurred at zonag lake and yanhu lake basins in the hol xil region lu et al 2021 after the lake outburst in 2011 and a new hydrological connection with the source region of the yangtze river was established between 2000 and 2018 a total of 11 drainage system reorganization events occurred on the tp as a primary result of drastic lake expansion liu et al 2021 cheng et al 2021a b assessed the potential risk of lake expansion on residential settlements and infrastructure and found that some residential settlements and road segments may become submerged in the next two decades extreme lake level changes are seldom investigated on the tp although they can have serious impacts on the human living environment field expeditions showed that rapid lake expansion occurred on the central tp ctp during 2017 2018 and strongly influenced residential settlements and infrastructure however the processes causes and impact of the extreme event remain unclear in this study we first explored the processes and extent of the extreme expansion in 2017 2018 using in situ observations in combination with satellite altimetry then investigated the main causes based on ground meteorological observations and era 5 reanalysis data and finally addressed its impact on the ecosystem and human living environment 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area more than 1400 lakes larger than 1 0 km2 are distributed across the tp with a total lake area of 50000 km2 which accounts for more than half of the total lake area in china ma et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 owing to its remoteness and high elevation in situ lake level observations on the tp are only available at a few lakes e g qinghai lake yangdro yumco zabuye salt lake and nam co etc bian et al 2009 li et al 2011 zhou 2020 since 2013 we have performed in situ lake level observations at more than 10 lakes on the tp lei et al 2017 and the data are now accessible via nation tibetan plateau date center https data tpdc ac cn after 2016 lake dynamics exhibited a contrasting pattern between the eastern and western ctp lakes on the eastern ctp contracted slightly whereas the lakes on the western ctp expanded drastically in this study we mainly focused on water level changes on the western ctp because the rapid lake expansion posed a substantial threat to residential habitats and infrastructure five lakes on the western ctp are investigated in this study fig 1 including zhari namco and dawa co in cuoqin county dagze co in nima county and cedo caka and eya co in shuanghu county for comparison lake level changes on the eastern ctp are also investigated including nam co bam co and pung co detailed information about the eight lakes is shown in table 1 2 2 lake level observations water level loggers manufactured by hobo corp usa were used to monitor the lake level changes and were installed in the littoral zones of the lakes to validate the lake level changes multiple water level loggers were installed in different regions of zhari namco and dagze co because water levels were recorded as changes in pressure less than 0 5 cm water level equivalent air pressure was subtracted from the level loggers to obtain pressure changes related to water column variations daily lake level changes were used in this study lake level data were available at zhari namco between august 2009 and september 2021 at dawa co and dazeg co lake level data were available between june 2013 and september 2021 exception for the period between october 2016 and september 2017 cryosat 2 data were used to connect lake level data during this period lake level observations at eya co began in october 2015 at cede caka the water level was monitored in 2013 using an abandoned bridge as a reference the water depth of the loggers was measured during fieldwork to validate the logger data 2 3 satellite observations to detect the spatial distribution of extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 multi mission satellite altimetry data were used to detect water level changes in dozens of lakes on the tp hydroweb altimetry data were derived from merged topex poseidon jason envisat and sentinel data crétaux et al 2011 2016 lake level changes since the early 1990s were available for approximately 30 lakes on the tp cryosat 2 data processed by xu et al 2022 were used to investigate lake level variations between 2010 and 2020 water level changes were investigated for 54 lakes larger than 100 km2 to investigate long term lake level changes icesat 1 icesat 2 and cryosat 2 satellite altimetry data were combined between 2003 and 2020 notably icesat series and cryosat 2 data are referenced to different ellipsoids and geoid height the icesat data contains corrected surface ellipsoidal heights referenced to the topex poseidon ellipsoid and the geoid height is referenced to earth gravity model egm 2008 the cryosat 2 data are referenced to wgs84 and egm96 song et al 2015 by comparing cryosat 2 and icesat 2 satellite altimetry data in dry season within 15 days the elevation difference of 0 4 0 5 m was determined as the bias of the two datasets and used to correct the cryosat 2 altimetry data landsat images from the usgs website https glovis usgs gov were used to investigate long term changes in lake extent lake boundaries were extracted from false colour images via manual delineation using arcgis 10 1 software the accuracy of manual digitization was controlled within an error of one pixel 30 m the relationship between lake area and the satellite altimetry derived lake level data was developed using a linear regression model continual lake level changes at dawa co and dazeg co since 1990 were reconstructed using this relationship and the corresponding lake area for cedo caka and eya co we do not reconstruct lake level changes before 2003 because the linear regression not suitable to reconstruct the long term lake level changes satellite altimetry data is not enough for eya co while lake surface extent changed too much for cade caka for zhari namco lake level changes between 1992 and 2020 derived from the topex poseidon and jason1 2 3 altimeter data were used sun et al 2021b 2 4 meteorological data there is no national meteorological station around the observed lakes on the western ctp to evaluate the detailed hydrological processes we installed several automatic weather stations aws from 4 400 m a s l near the lake to 5 880 m a s l near the glacier terminus in dagze co basin in july 2015 yang et al 2018 precipitation at these stations was monitored using rg 3 rain gauges and monthly precipitation data from 5880 m a s l were used in this study in cedo caka and eya co basins we installed an aws in the upstream of the two lakes at an elevation of 5 725 m a s l in november 2014 fig 1 precipitation was monitored using a shielded geonor t 200b precipitation gauge on the terminal moraine at an elevation of 5 550 m in november 2015 li et al 2018 and the monthly precipitation data were analyzed precipitation data from gaize meteorological station was used to reflect precipitation changes in the zhari namco and dawa co basins long term changes in the main components of lake water balance including air temperature precipitation evaporation and runoff were investigated on the ctp the annual mean air temperature was derived from gaize meteorological station precipitation and runoff were derived from era5 land monthly averaged dataset which was the fifth generation reanalysis of the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf for global applications muñoz sabater et al 2021 the dataset has a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 runoff in the era5 land dataset is simulated with the ecmwf land surface model by using the era5 reanalysis as the atmospheric forcing data precipitation in the era5 land dataset is resampled from the era5 reanalysis using a linear model therefore precipitation in the two datasets has similar spatiotemporal variations recent studies sun et al 2021a yuan et al 2021 have shown that the era5 precipitation dataset can generally capture the seasonal variations and spatial distributions of precipitation in both magnitude and trends in high mountain asia and has better performances than other gridded products on longer time scales although it overestimates precipitation amounts changes in lake evaporation were derived from satellite observation and modeling by zhao et al 2022a 3 results 3 1 abrupt lake expansion in 2017 2018 spatial and temporal patterns of lake dynamic on the tp have been densely investigated during the last decade e g lei et al 2014 yang et al 2017 zhao et al 2022b lake dynamics since the 1970s on the inner tp can be mainly divided into two stages namely the considerable contraction before the middle 1990 s and rapid expansion after the late 1990s for the five observed lakes on the western ctp the transition from contraction to rapid expansion occurred in 1998 1999 fig 2 satellite altimetry data showed that the water levels of zhari namco dawa co and cedo caka increased at an average rate of 0 3 m yr 0 4 m yr and 0 8 m yr in the 2000s sun et al 2021b zhang et al 2013 lake expansion on the ctp slowed down in the early 2010s yang et al 2017 the lake area of zhari namco increased by 6 0 from 945 0 km2 to 1001 4 km2 and the lake level increased by 2 9 m between 1999 and 2014 sun et al 2021b the lake area of dagze co increased by 26 8 from 238 2 km2 to 302 2 km2 and lake level increased by 9 1 m between 1999 and 2014 crétaux et al 2011 2016 as a small and shallow lake cedo caka fluctuated at a much larger magnitude the total water extent in cedo caka basin increased by 74 1 from approximately 59 3 km2 to 103 2 km2 between 1999 and 2014 after the widespread lake contraction in 2015 in response to the super 2015 2016 el niño event lei et al 2019 the five observed lakes returned to their normal level in 2016 and then expanded abruptly in 2017 and 2018 these lake level increases in the two years were much higher than before and had not occurred since the late 1990 s at zhari namco and dawa co the lake level increased significantly by 2 8 m and 1 8 m in 2017 2018 fig 3 respectively the lake level increase at zhari namco in the two years was even close to the entire lake level increase between 1999 and 2014 using the topex poseidon and jason1 2 3 altimeter data sun et al 2021b showed that the water level of zhari namco increased at an average rate of 0 33 m yr between 2000 and 2008 and then remained stable on an inter annual time scale between 2009 and 2014 the rate of lake level increase in 2017 2018 was 4 5 times as large as that between 2000 and 2008 at dagze co the lake level increased significantly by 2 1 m in 2017 2018 and the rising rate of lake level was approximately twice as large as that between 1999 and 2014 0 6 m yr crétaux et al 2011 2016 at eya co and cedo caka the lake level increased by 1 4 m and 1 8 m in 2017 2018 respectively which was also considerably higher than before the lake water extent also increased abruptly in 2017 2018 at zhari namco the lake water extent increased by 43 6 km2 in the two years accounting for 77 2 of the total lake area increase between 1999 and 2014 fig 2 the shoreline moved outward by tens of meters to more than one kilometer in the southwest of zhari namco in 2017 2018 the lake area of dagze co increased by 10 in 2017 2018 which was approximately 37 of the total lake area increase between 1999 and 2014 small and shallow lakes are more easily affected by climatic change and usually exhibit much larger inter annual fluctuations than large and deep lakes because a slight lake level change can cause large fluctuations of lake water extent for example cede caka lake extent increased by 23 in 2017 2018 accounting for 31 of the total lake area increase between 1999 and 2014 in contrast with the rapid lake expansion on the western ctp in situ observations indicate that lakes on the eastern ctp decreased slightly or remained stable in 2017 2018 fig 3d three lakes were monitored on the eastern ctp including nam co bam co and pung co these three lakes exhibited slight lake level fluctuations between 2010 and 2014 and have contracted considerably since 2015 lake level decreased accumulatively by more than 1 m at bam co and pung co between 2015 and 2018 the contrasting pattern of lake dynamics between the eastern and western ctp indicates that the two regions may be mainly affected by different climate systems through examining water level changes in more lakes the boundary of the two patterns of lake dynamics was identified as siling co basin the largest lake on the ctp to the west and north of siling co basin extreme lake expansion occurred in 2017 2018 whereas a considerable lake level decrease occurred to the east of siling co basin this contrasting pattern of lake dynamics can also be found in the 1990 s for example yang et al 2017 showed that lakes on the western ctp contracted considerably in the 1990 s whereas lakes on eastern ctp expanded slightly 3 2 processes of the extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 in situ observations revealed the detailed processes of the abrupt lake level increase generally lake level seasonality on the ctp is characterized by a considerable lake level increase during the summer monsoon season a decrease during the post monsoon season and a steady state during the ice covered period lei et al 2017 as shown in fig 4 the lake level of the observed lakes increased significantly in 2017 and 2018 in contrast with the considerable decrease in 2015 seasonally lake level increases in summer 2017 and 2018 were much larger than those in normal years whereas there was no significant difference during the post monsoon season and the ice covered period for example lake level of zhari namco increased by 1 4 m and 1 8 m in summer 2017 and 2018 respectively which were twice or three times as large as that in normal years at eya co the lake level increased 0 7 0 8 m in summer 2017 and 2018 which were about twice as high as that in normal years this indicates that the extreme lake expansion mainly occurred during the summer monsoon season in contrast an anomalous lake level decrease occurred in the summer of 2015 owing to the extremely low precipitation in response to the 2015 2016 el niño event lei et al 2019 fig 4 it should be noted that the water level of dagze co increased considerably by approximately 0 4 m during the cold season january to april in 2017 2018 fig 4c accounting for 20 30 of the annual increase which was also different from that in normal years data not shown because there is limited snowfall surface runoff and sublimation during the ice covered period the considerable lake level increase can be mainly attributed to groundwater inflow into the lake lei et al 2022 3 3 precipitation anomaly in 2017 2018 the extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 corresponded closely with precipitation changes in the drainage basins in dagze co basin in situ observations from the aws station at an elevation of 5880 m a s l show that the precipitation amount occurred in summer 2016 2018 was anomalously high with a mean value of 490 mm fig 5 b which was 96 8 higher than that in 2019 2020 a mean value of 249 mm because lake level of dagze co only increased slightly in 2019 2020 we therefore consider the mean precipitation in 2019 2020 as a normal value one can see that precipitation in 2017 2018 was about twice the normal value in cedo caka and eya co basins in situ observations from the aws station at an elevation of 5 725 a s l show that anomalously high precipitation occurred in 2016 2018 with a mean value of 293 mm fig 5c which was 42 9 higher than in 2019 2020 a mean value of 205 mm in zhari namco and dawa co basins meteorological data from gaize station shows that the highest precipitation 367 mm occurred in 2017 fig 5a which was nearly double the multi year average 218 mm 2000 2020 precipitation in 2016 and 2018 was not as high as that in 2017 but was still approximately 30 higher than the multi year average the good correspondence between lake level changes and precipitation indicates that anomalously high precipitation was the main causes of the extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 on the western ctp notably although high precipitation also occurred in 2016 there was no considerable lake level increase in five observed lakes on the western ctp a possible explanation for the time lag between precipitation and lake level changes is that a portion of the rainfall supplemented the water deficit in soil and groundwater in 2015 this also indicates that continuously high precipitation between 2016 and 2018 contributed to the extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 3 4 environmental impact of the unprecedented lake expansion in 2017 2018 the 2017 2018 lake expansion has not only affected the geomorphology and regional ecosystems but also posed a threat to the human living environment in this study we address this issue in terms of water quality geomorphology infrastructure and residential settlements according to extensive field observations in recent years firstly rapid lake expansion led to a connection with nearby lakes or upstream lakes thereby altering geomorphology water quality and even the aquatic ecosystem taking dawa co as an example the lake level increased rapidly by approximately 1 8 m in 2017 2018 and has demonstrably influenced lake morphology and geomorphology there are two lakes in the basin dawa co and qingmuke co dawa co expanded rapidly whereas qingmuke co has remained stable since the late 1990s between 2003 and 2009 the water level of dawa co increased considerably at an average rate of 0 4 m yr zhang et al 2013 until 2016 dawa co was separated from qingmuke co by a paleo shoreline with a height of 1 2 m the large lake level increase during 2017 2018 led to its connection with qingmuke co fig 6 landsat satellite images showed that the two lakes started to connect by october 2017 and became one lake by october 2018 because dawa co is a saline lake tds 18 g l while qingmuke co is brackish tds 1 5 g l the connection of the two lakes significantly altered the water quality of qingmuke co owing to the intrusion of saline water from dawa co qingmuke co has also become a saline lake with tds of 13 1 g l measured in may 2022 changes in water quality may substantially affect the aquatic ecosystem in qingmuke co in fact lake combinations have often occurred on the tp owing to rapid lake expansion during the last two decades e g siling co meng et al 2012 amur co lei et al 2012 angzi co cheng et al 2022 qinghai lake cheng et al 2021b secondly rapid lake expansion led to the submergence of infrastructure around the lake including roads and bridges and became a significant threat to human living environment taking cedo caka as an example the lake expanded rapidly during the past two decades between 2003 and 2009 the water level of cedo caka increased rapidly at a rate of 0 8 m yr which was the highest among the lakes on the tp zhang et al 2013 the road around the western part of the lake was diverted twice in 2009 and 2012 owing to rapid lake expansion a bridge near the lake was abandoned in 2012 and submerged in 2018 as well fig 7 c d tirangbi co is located in the upstream of cedo caka and there is a road between the two lakes that connects shuanghu county and yaqu village the rapid lake expansion of cedo caka over the last two decades has led to its connection with tirangbi co since 2012 fig 7 the water level of cede caka increased abruptly by 1 8 m in 2017 2018 0 7 m in 2017 and 1 1 m in 2018 the road and bridge between the two lakes were further threatened by the extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 our field expedition in october 2021 showed that the road was nearly submerged and the bridge between the two lakes was only approximately 0 5 m higher than the lake surface fig 7f notably if the road from shuanghu county to yaqu village is submerged at least dozens of kilometers of new roads will have to be rebuilt along the south and east of tirangbi co one can see that although the lake expansion is a gradual process compared with glacial lake outbursts or other natural hazards it can still pose a major threat to the human living environment and cause great economic loss thirdly rapid lake expansion posed potential threat to residential settlements for example lake level of zhari namco increased unprecedentedly by 2 8 m in 2017 2018 which was close to the total increase between 2000 and 2015 to the southeast of zhari namco the lake level increase has caused the shoreline to move outward by dozens to hundreds of meters a small village with an area of approximately 0 26 km2 is being threatened by the extreme lake expansion fig 8 a b the village was 150 350 m away from zhari namco in october 2016 fig 8c our field expedition showed that it was only 30 130 m away from the lake in may 2021 and was less than 2 m higher than the lake level fig 8d if the lake continues to expand the village will be submerged according to liu et al 2021 drainage reorganization occurred in 2017 in zhari namco basin to the north of zhari namco the rapid expansion of anggu co in 2017 led to its outflow to qige co an upstream lake of zhari namco amplification of the drainage basin further accelerated the rapid lake expansion under the background of climate warming the tp is projected to become warmer and wetter chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 although warmer and wetter climates are beneficial to the ecosystems on the tp the risk of natural hazards may also increase there are already several studies about the impact of lake expansion on the human living environment for example roads and bridges were submerged at qinghai lake cheng et al 2021a b siling co bian et al 2010 and pung co bian et al 2006 a similar situation also occurred in angzi co basin where a village near the lake may be submerged in approximately ten years if the lake level continues to increase wang et al 2019 cheng et al 2022 it is therefore necessary to identify the potential sites threatened by lake expansion on the tp using high resolution satellite images and perform near real time observations of water level changes for these specific lakes including both satellite and in situ observations 4 discussion 4 1 spatial pattern of extreme lake level variations in 2017 2018 the extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 not only occurred in the observed lakes but also in many others on the tp lu et al 2021 jiang et al 2020 zhan et al 2020 using hydroweb and cryosat 2 satellite altimetry data released from crétaux et al 2011 2016 and xu et al 2022 we explored the spatial pattern of the extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 on the tp fig 9 a a total of 54 lakes across the tp were detected on the ctp the contrasting pattern of lake dynamics was confirmed by examining water level variations at more lakes fig 9a to the west of siling co basin most lakes exhibited extreme expansion in 2017 2018 with an average water level increase of 1 7 m for the nine detected lakes e g anglarenco renqingxiubu co tangro yunmco and angzi co such a rapid lake level increase has not occurred since the late 1990s in contrast to the east of siling co basin most lakes exhibited slight lake level fluctuations on an inter annual time scale or even contracted slightly in 2017 2018 fig 9a the levels of the four detected lakes i e nam co zige tangco bam co and pung co decreased by 0 2 m on average during these two years on the northern and northeastern tp lakes also exhibited extreme expansion in 2017 2018 fig 9 on the northern tp the lake level increased by 1 8 m on average for the eight detected lakes e g hol hil lake lexie wudan lake ulan ula lake and ayakkum lake on the northeastern tp the lake level of the five detected lakes e g qinghai lake hala lake gyaring lake and ngoring lake increased by 1 5 m on average the magnitude of lake level increase on the northern tp was even larger than that on the western ctp fig 9a of the 54 detected lakes toson lake in the qaidam basin exhibited the most rapid expansion with lake level increase of 3 m in 2017 2018 rapid lake expansion also occurred in 2016 on the northern tp which was one year earlier than that on the ctp similar rapid lake expansion also occurred in 2002 2004 and 2009 2012 for example the zonag lake outburst in september 2011 followed rapid lake expansion in preceding years which further led to the outburst at kusai lake and haidingnuoer lake downstream yao et al 2012 lu et al 2021 qinghai lake has expanded rapidly since 2004 after a long term lake level decrease since the 1960s li et al 2011 and its water level in 2020 was close to that in the early 1960s cheng et al 2021b on the western tp lakes also exhibited rapid expansion during 2017 2018 the water level of the ten detected lakes e g lumajiangdong co north heishibei lake bangda co and memar co increased by 1 2 m on average in 2017 2018 the rate of lake level increase on the western tp was relatively smaller in the two years compared to those of the lakes on the central and northern tp fig 9a however lakes on the western tp exhibited a steady expansion during the past two decades in contrast to lakes in other regions of the tp qiao et al 2017 li et al 2019 on the southern tp the lakes exhibited contrasting patterns to those on the inner tp most lakes only exhibited slight water level increase or even contracted in 2017 2018 the water levels of the five detected lakes across the southern tp e g yangdro yumco paiku co mangpang yumco and la ng co increased by 0 2 m on average in 2017 2018 this contrasting pattern of lake dynamics between the southern and interior tp has also occurred since the late 1990s lei et al 2014 therefore the extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 is generally consistent with the overall pattern of tp lake dynamics since the late 1990 s except on the eastern ctp 4 2 main causes of the 2017 2018 unprecedented lake expansion studies showed that an increase in precipitation was the primary factor affecting the rapid lake expansion on the tp zhou et al 2015 2022 tong et al 2016 biskop et al 2016 lazhu et al 2016 causes of the extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 are investigated by examining long term changes in air temperature precipitation runoff and lake evaporation on the ctp here we take zhari namco as an example because there is longest interannual lake level change sun et al 2021b fig 10 shows long term lake level changes of zhari namco and the main components of lake water balance since the 1990s one can see that there is close correspondence between precipitation and lake level changes between 1993 and 2020 low precipitation in the 1990s corresponded to a considerable lake level decrease and high precipitation in the 2000s corresponded to a considerable lake level increase notably the precipitation in 2017 and 2018 was the highest during the past three decades which corresponded to an extreme lake level increase meanwhile runoff which is mainly determined by precipitation exhibited a similar pattern with lake level changes fig 10d this indicates that precipitation and the associated runoff were the dominant driver of lake level changes in zhari namco during the past three decades we also examined other factors influencing lake level changes including air temperature and lake evaporation fig 10 the annual mean air temperature increased considerably at a rate of 0 66 c 10 yr at gaize meteorological station there is no close correlation between air temperature and lake level changes changes in permafrost thawing and glacier melting may not be the main factor of the extreme lake expansion because the annua mean air temperature was at a normal level in 2017 2018 long term changes in lake evaporation were investigated using satellite observation and modeling by zhao et al 2022a because lake area increased rapidly during the past years not only evaporation rate but also changes in lake area affected the total water loss from lake surface fig 10b shows that lake evaporation increased rapidly during the past three decades indicating that evaporation considerably suppresses lake expansion lazhu et al 2016 in 2017 and 2018 evaporation amount was relatively high which indicates that it was not the main cause of the rapid lake expansion using a simple linear regression model we found that precipitation runoff and lake evaporation can well reproduce lake level changes during the past three decades r2 0 73 p 0 001 on a larger scale we investigated the spatial distribution of the precipitation anomaly in 2017 2018 using the era5 land monthly averaged dataset fig 9b a comparison between era5 land precipitation and rain gauge data shows that the two datasets have good consistency in dagze co and cedo caka basins fig 5b c thus indicating that era5 precipitation is reliable in reflecting the spatial pattern and long term variations of precipitation in the study area fig 3 fig 9b shows that anomalously high precipitation occurred almost throughout the inner tp in 2017 2018 in contrast with the decrease in precipitation in its southern and eastern regions this spatial pattern is generally consistent with the widespread lake expansion on the interior tp the most remarkable increase in precipitation occurred in the qaidam basin and western ctp where the lake level increased most rapidly fig 9a the slight increase in precipitation also corresponded well with the stable status of lake dynamics on the eastern ctp therefore the unprecedented lake expansion in 2017 2018 was mainly attributed to anomalously high precipitation and the associated runoff on the inner tp 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the processes main causes and environmental impacts of extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 on the ctp after the considerable lake level decrease in 2015 and subsequent recovery in 2016 lakes on the central and northern tp expanded at unprecedented rate in 2017 2018 in 2017 2018 the water level of the five observed lakes zhari namco dawa co dagze co eya co and cedo caka increased by 2 8 m 1 8 m 2 2 m 1 4 m and 1 8 m respectively the rates of lake level increase were several times larger than the averages in 2003 2009 and 2003 2018 rapid lake expansion was mainly attributed to anomalously high precipitation in situ observations in dagze co and cedo caka basins show that precipitation was approximately 43 97 higher in 2017 2018 than in normal years the extreme lake level increase exerted a substantial influence not only on the geomorphology but also on infrastructure and residential habitats the rapid lake expansion of dawa co led to its connection with qingmuke co substantially affecting the water quality and aquatic ecosystems a small village near zhari namco will soon become inundated if the lake continues to expand infrastructure including road and bridges near cedo caka became inundated and the road from shuanghu to yaqu village will have to be diverted owing to the rapid lake expansion it is necessary to identify the potential sites threatened by lake expansion on the tp using high resolution satellite images and perform near real time observations of lake level changes including both satellite and in situ observations credit

2170,extreme events on the tibetan plateau tp have become increasingly frequent and severe in recent decades in tandem with rapid climate warming and moistening thus it is highly important to investigate their processes causes and environmental impacts using in situ observations of lake level changes in combination with satellite altimetry data we showed that lakes on the central tp ctp expanded unprecedentedly in 2017 2018 with lake level increases of 1 4 2 8 m at the five observed lakes this extreme lake expansion occurred over almost the entire inner tp which was mainly attributed to anomalously high precipitation approximately 43 97 higher in 2017 2018 than in normal years on the ctp the rapid lake expansion posed a substantial threat to regional ecosystems infrastructure and even residential habitats therefore it is necessary to identify the potential sites threatened by lake expansion on the tp using high resolution satellite images and perform near real time observations of lake level changes through satellite and in situ observations keywords lake expansion tibetan plateau environmental impacts climate extremes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction under climate warming extreme events such as heatwaves heavy rainfall snowstorms droughts and floods are becoming increasingly frequent and severe these extreme events have caused substantial losses of life as well as incurred tremendous economic costs easterling et al 2000 extreme events are governed by prevailing weather systems on shorter timescales and by modes of climate variability acting on the background states on longer timescales perkins kirkpatrick and pitman 2018 basconcillo et al 2021 for example el niňo is generally responsible for droughts whereas la niňa has a large influence on extreme rainfall with the opposite phases extreme precipitation events are expected to intensify under climate change with consequent impacts on flooding and ecosystem functions moustakis et al 2021 the tibetan plateau tp and its surroundings which function as the asian water tower are experiencing rapid climate change the annual mean air temperature on the tp rose rapidly at a rate of 0 35 10 yr between 1970 and 2014 which is approximately twice the global average chen et al 2015 changes in precipitation exhibited significant heterogeneity with a considerable increase on the inner tp and a decrease on the south and east tp peripheries yang et al 2014 climate warming has led to remarkable changes in cryosphere on the tp including glacier retreat decrease in snow cover degradation of permafrost and thickening of the active layer yao et al 2019 hydrological projections under future climate change suggest that streamflow in most river source regions will increase along with precipitation and ice snow melting and hydrological extremes such as flooding will occur increasingly frequently tang et al 2019 the tp boasts the greatest concentration of high altitude lakes in the world lake dynamics on the tp have been investigated over the last decade using satellite images or altimetry data e g hwang et al 2005 bian et al 2010 ma et al 2011 li et al 2014 icesat altimetry data showed that lake levels on the interior tp increased at an average rate of 0 20 m yr in 2003 2009 and at an average rate of 0 30 m yr in 2003 2018 zhang et al 2011 2019 song et al 2014 lake expansion led to changes in lake morphology geomorphology and the hydrological connection between rivers and lakes as well as exerted a profound influence on residential habitats and infrastructure for example drainage reorganization occurred at zonag lake and yanhu lake basins in the hol xil region lu et al 2021 after the lake outburst in 2011 and a new hydrological connection with the source region of the yangtze river was established between 2000 and 2018 a total of 11 drainage system reorganization events occurred on the tp as a primary result of drastic lake expansion liu et al 2021 cheng et al 2021a b assessed the potential risk of lake expansion on residential settlements and infrastructure and found that some residential settlements and road segments may become submerged in the next two decades extreme lake level changes are seldom investigated on the tp although they can have serious impacts on the human living environment field expeditions showed that rapid lake expansion occurred on the central tp ctp during 2017 2018 and strongly influenced residential settlements and infrastructure however the processes causes and impact of the extreme event remain unclear in this study we first explored the processes and extent of the extreme expansion in 2017 2018 using in situ observations in combination with satellite altimetry then investigated the main causes based on ground meteorological observations and era 5 reanalysis data and finally addressed its impact on the ecosystem and human living environment 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area more than 1400 lakes larger than 1 0 km2 are distributed across the tp with a total lake area of 50000 km2 which accounts for more than half of the total lake area in china ma et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 owing to its remoteness and high elevation in situ lake level observations on the tp are only available at a few lakes e g qinghai lake yangdro yumco zabuye salt lake and nam co etc bian et al 2009 li et al 2011 zhou 2020 since 2013 we have performed in situ lake level observations at more than 10 lakes on the tp lei et al 2017 and the data are now accessible via nation tibetan plateau date center https data tpdc ac cn after 2016 lake dynamics exhibited a contrasting pattern between the eastern and western ctp lakes on the eastern ctp contracted slightly whereas the lakes on the western ctp expanded drastically in this study we mainly focused on water level changes on the western ctp because the rapid lake expansion posed a substantial threat to residential habitats and infrastructure five lakes on the western ctp are investigated in this study fig 1 including zhari namco and dawa co in cuoqin county dagze co in nima county and cedo caka and eya co in shuanghu county for comparison lake level changes on the eastern ctp are also investigated including nam co bam co and pung co detailed information about the eight lakes is shown in table 1 2 2 lake level observations water level loggers manufactured by hobo corp usa were used to monitor the lake level changes and were installed in the littoral zones of the lakes to validate the lake level changes multiple water level loggers were installed in different regions of zhari namco and dagze co because water levels were recorded as changes in pressure less than 0 5 cm water level equivalent air pressure was subtracted from the level loggers to obtain pressure changes related to water column variations daily lake level changes were used in this study lake level data were available at zhari namco between august 2009 and september 2021 at dawa co and dazeg co lake level data were available between june 2013 and september 2021 exception for the period between october 2016 and september 2017 cryosat 2 data were used to connect lake level data during this period lake level observations at eya co began in october 2015 at cede caka the water level was monitored in 2013 using an abandoned bridge as a reference the water depth of the loggers was measured during fieldwork to validate the logger data 2 3 satellite observations to detect the spatial distribution of extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 multi mission satellite altimetry data were used to detect water level changes in dozens of lakes on the tp hydroweb altimetry data were derived from merged topex poseidon jason envisat and sentinel data crétaux et al 2011 2016 lake level changes since the early 1990s were available for approximately 30 lakes on the tp cryosat 2 data processed by xu et al 2022 were used to investigate lake level variations between 2010 and 2020 water level changes were investigated for 54 lakes larger than 100 km2 to investigate long term lake level changes icesat 1 icesat 2 and cryosat 2 satellite altimetry data were combined between 2003 and 2020 notably icesat series and cryosat 2 data are referenced to different ellipsoids and geoid height the icesat data contains corrected surface ellipsoidal heights referenced to the topex poseidon ellipsoid and the geoid height is referenced to earth gravity model egm 2008 the cryosat 2 data are referenced to wgs84 and egm96 song et al 2015 by comparing cryosat 2 and icesat 2 satellite altimetry data in dry season within 15 days the elevation difference of 0 4 0 5 m was determined as the bias of the two datasets and used to correct the cryosat 2 altimetry data landsat images from the usgs website https glovis usgs gov were used to investigate long term changes in lake extent lake boundaries were extracted from false colour images via manual delineation using arcgis 10 1 software the accuracy of manual digitization was controlled within an error of one pixel 30 m the relationship between lake area and the satellite altimetry derived lake level data was developed using a linear regression model continual lake level changes at dawa co and dazeg co since 1990 were reconstructed using this relationship and the corresponding lake area for cedo caka and eya co we do not reconstruct lake level changes before 2003 because the linear regression not suitable to reconstruct the long term lake level changes satellite altimetry data is not enough for eya co while lake surface extent changed too much for cade caka for zhari namco lake level changes between 1992 and 2020 derived from the topex poseidon and jason1 2 3 altimeter data were used sun et al 2021b 2 4 meteorological data there is no national meteorological station around the observed lakes on the western ctp to evaluate the detailed hydrological processes we installed several automatic weather stations aws from 4 400 m a s l near the lake to 5 880 m a s l near the glacier terminus in dagze co basin in july 2015 yang et al 2018 precipitation at these stations was monitored using rg 3 rain gauges and monthly precipitation data from 5880 m a s l were used in this study in cedo caka and eya co basins we installed an aws in the upstream of the two lakes at an elevation of 5 725 m a s l in november 2014 fig 1 precipitation was monitored using a shielded geonor t 200b precipitation gauge on the terminal moraine at an elevation of 5 550 m in november 2015 li et al 2018 and the monthly precipitation data were analyzed precipitation data from gaize meteorological station was used to reflect precipitation changes in the zhari namco and dawa co basins long term changes in the main components of lake water balance including air temperature precipitation evaporation and runoff were investigated on the ctp the annual mean air temperature was derived from gaize meteorological station precipitation and runoff were derived from era5 land monthly averaged dataset which was the fifth generation reanalysis of the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf for global applications muñoz sabater et al 2021 the dataset has a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 runoff in the era5 land dataset is simulated with the ecmwf land surface model by using the era5 reanalysis as the atmospheric forcing data precipitation in the era5 land dataset is resampled from the era5 reanalysis using a linear model therefore precipitation in the two datasets has similar spatiotemporal variations recent studies sun et al 2021a yuan et al 2021 have shown that the era5 precipitation dataset can generally capture the seasonal variations and spatial distributions of precipitation in both magnitude and trends in high mountain asia and has better performances than other gridded products on longer time scales although it overestimates precipitation amounts changes in lake evaporation were derived from satellite observation and modeling by zhao et al 2022a 3 results 3 1 abrupt lake expansion in 2017 2018 spatial and temporal patterns of lake dynamic on the tp have been densely investigated during the last decade e g lei et al 2014 yang et al 2017 zhao et al 2022b lake dynamics since the 1970s on the inner tp can be mainly divided into two stages namely the considerable contraction before the middle 1990 s and rapid expansion after the late 1990s for the five observed lakes on the western ctp the transition from contraction to rapid expansion occurred in 1998 1999 fig 2 satellite altimetry data showed that the water levels of zhari namco dawa co and cedo caka increased at an average rate of 0 3 m yr 0 4 m yr and 0 8 m yr in the 2000s sun et al 2021b zhang et al 2013 lake expansion on the ctp slowed down in the early 2010s yang et al 2017 the lake area of zhari namco increased by 6 0 from 945 0 km2 to 1001 4 km2 and the lake level increased by 2 9 m between 1999 and 2014 sun et al 2021b the lake area of dagze co increased by 26 8 from 238 2 km2 to 302 2 km2 and lake level increased by 9 1 m between 1999 and 2014 crétaux et al 2011 2016 as a small and shallow lake cedo caka fluctuated at a much larger magnitude the total water extent in cedo caka basin increased by 74 1 from approximately 59 3 km2 to 103 2 km2 between 1999 and 2014 after the widespread lake contraction in 2015 in response to the super 2015 2016 el niño event lei et al 2019 the five observed lakes returned to their normal level in 2016 and then expanded abruptly in 2017 and 2018 these lake level increases in the two years were much higher than before and had not occurred since the late 1990 s at zhari namco and dawa co the lake level increased significantly by 2 8 m and 1 8 m in 2017 2018 fig 3 respectively the lake level increase at zhari namco in the two years was even close to the entire lake level increase between 1999 and 2014 using the topex poseidon and jason1 2 3 altimeter data sun et al 2021b showed that the water level of zhari namco increased at an average rate of 0 33 m yr between 2000 and 2008 and then remained stable on an inter annual time scale between 2009 and 2014 the rate of lake level increase in 2017 2018 was 4 5 times as large as that between 2000 and 2008 at dagze co the lake level increased significantly by 2 1 m in 2017 2018 and the rising rate of lake level was approximately twice as large as that between 1999 and 2014 0 6 m yr crétaux et al 2011 2016 at eya co and cedo caka the lake level increased by 1 4 m and 1 8 m in 2017 2018 respectively which was also considerably higher than before the lake water extent also increased abruptly in 2017 2018 at zhari namco the lake water extent increased by 43 6 km2 in the two years accounting for 77 2 of the total lake area increase between 1999 and 2014 fig 2 the shoreline moved outward by tens of meters to more than one kilometer in the southwest of zhari namco in 2017 2018 the lake area of dagze co increased by 10 in 2017 2018 which was approximately 37 of the total lake area increase between 1999 and 2014 small and shallow lakes are more easily affected by climatic change and usually exhibit much larger inter annual fluctuations than large and deep lakes because a slight lake level change can cause large fluctuations of lake water extent for example cede caka lake extent increased by 23 in 2017 2018 accounting for 31 of the total lake area increase between 1999 and 2014 in contrast with the rapid lake expansion on the western ctp in situ observations indicate that lakes on the eastern ctp decreased slightly or remained stable in 2017 2018 fig 3d three lakes were monitored on the eastern ctp including nam co bam co and pung co these three lakes exhibited slight lake level fluctuations between 2010 and 2014 and have contracted considerably since 2015 lake level decreased accumulatively by more than 1 m at bam co and pung co between 2015 and 2018 the contrasting pattern of lake dynamics between the eastern and western ctp indicates that the two regions may be mainly affected by different climate systems through examining water level changes in more lakes the boundary of the two patterns of lake dynamics was identified as siling co basin the largest lake on the ctp to the west and north of siling co basin extreme lake expansion occurred in 2017 2018 whereas a considerable lake level decrease occurred to the east of siling co basin this contrasting pattern of lake dynamics can also be found in the 1990 s for example yang et al 2017 showed that lakes on the western ctp contracted considerably in the 1990 s whereas lakes on eastern ctp expanded slightly 3 2 processes of the extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 in situ observations revealed the detailed processes of the abrupt lake level increase generally lake level seasonality on the ctp is characterized by a considerable lake level increase during the summer monsoon season a decrease during the post monsoon season and a steady state during the ice covered period lei et al 2017 as shown in fig 4 the lake level of the observed lakes increased significantly in 2017 and 2018 in contrast with the considerable decrease in 2015 seasonally lake level increases in summer 2017 and 2018 were much larger than those in normal years whereas there was no significant difference during the post monsoon season and the ice covered period for example lake level of zhari namco increased by 1 4 m and 1 8 m in summer 2017 and 2018 respectively which were twice or three times as large as that in normal years at eya co the lake level increased 0 7 0 8 m in summer 2017 and 2018 which were about twice as high as that in normal years this indicates that the extreme lake expansion mainly occurred during the summer monsoon season in contrast an anomalous lake level decrease occurred in the summer of 2015 owing to the extremely low precipitation in response to the 2015 2016 el niño event lei et al 2019 fig 4 it should be noted that the water level of dagze co increased considerably by approximately 0 4 m during the cold season january to april in 2017 2018 fig 4c accounting for 20 30 of the annual increase which was also different from that in normal years data not shown because there is limited snowfall surface runoff and sublimation during the ice covered period the considerable lake level increase can be mainly attributed to groundwater inflow into the lake lei et al 2022 3 3 precipitation anomaly in 2017 2018 the extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 corresponded closely with precipitation changes in the drainage basins in dagze co basin in situ observations from the aws station at an elevation of 5880 m a s l show that the precipitation amount occurred in summer 2016 2018 was anomalously high with a mean value of 490 mm fig 5 b which was 96 8 higher than that in 2019 2020 a mean value of 249 mm because lake level of dagze co only increased slightly in 2019 2020 we therefore consider the mean precipitation in 2019 2020 as a normal value one can see that precipitation in 2017 2018 was about twice the normal value in cedo caka and eya co basins in situ observations from the aws station at an elevation of 5 725 a s l show that anomalously high precipitation occurred in 2016 2018 with a mean value of 293 mm fig 5c which was 42 9 higher than in 2019 2020 a mean value of 205 mm in zhari namco and dawa co basins meteorological data from gaize station shows that the highest precipitation 367 mm occurred in 2017 fig 5a which was nearly double the multi year average 218 mm 2000 2020 precipitation in 2016 and 2018 was not as high as that in 2017 but was still approximately 30 higher than the multi year average the good correspondence between lake level changes and precipitation indicates that anomalously high precipitation was the main causes of the extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 on the western ctp notably although high precipitation also occurred in 2016 there was no considerable lake level increase in five observed lakes on the western ctp a possible explanation for the time lag between precipitation and lake level changes is that a portion of the rainfall supplemented the water deficit in soil and groundwater in 2015 this also indicates that continuously high precipitation between 2016 and 2018 contributed to the extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 3 4 environmental impact of the unprecedented lake expansion in 2017 2018 the 2017 2018 lake expansion has not only affected the geomorphology and regional ecosystems but also posed a threat to the human living environment in this study we address this issue in terms of water quality geomorphology infrastructure and residential settlements according to extensive field observations in recent years firstly rapid lake expansion led to a connection with nearby lakes or upstream lakes thereby altering geomorphology water quality and even the aquatic ecosystem taking dawa co as an example the lake level increased rapidly by approximately 1 8 m in 2017 2018 and has demonstrably influenced lake morphology and geomorphology there are two lakes in the basin dawa co and qingmuke co dawa co expanded rapidly whereas qingmuke co has remained stable since the late 1990s between 2003 and 2009 the water level of dawa co increased considerably at an average rate of 0 4 m yr zhang et al 2013 until 2016 dawa co was separated from qingmuke co by a paleo shoreline with a height of 1 2 m the large lake level increase during 2017 2018 led to its connection with qingmuke co fig 6 landsat satellite images showed that the two lakes started to connect by october 2017 and became one lake by october 2018 because dawa co is a saline lake tds 18 g l while qingmuke co is brackish tds 1 5 g l the connection of the two lakes significantly altered the water quality of qingmuke co owing to the intrusion of saline water from dawa co qingmuke co has also become a saline lake with tds of 13 1 g l measured in may 2022 changes in water quality may substantially affect the aquatic ecosystem in qingmuke co in fact lake combinations have often occurred on the tp owing to rapid lake expansion during the last two decades e g siling co meng et al 2012 amur co lei et al 2012 angzi co cheng et al 2022 qinghai lake cheng et al 2021b secondly rapid lake expansion led to the submergence of infrastructure around the lake including roads and bridges and became a significant threat to human living environment taking cedo caka as an example the lake expanded rapidly during the past two decades between 2003 and 2009 the water level of cedo caka increased rapidly at a rate of 0 8 m yr which was the highest among the lakes on the tp zhang et al 2013 the road around the western part of the lake was diverted twice in 2009 and 2012 owing to rapid lake expansion a bridge near the lake was abandoned in 2012 and submerged in 2018 as well fig 7 c d tirangbi co is located in the upstream of cedo caka and there is a road between the two lakes that connects shuanghu county and yaqu village the rapid lake expansion of cedo caka over the last two decades has led to its connection with tirangbi co since 2012 fig 7 the water level of cede caka increased abruptly by 1 8 m in 2017 2018 0 7 m in 2017 and 1 1 m in 2018 the road and bridge between the two lakes were further threatened by the extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 our field expedition in october 2021 showed that the road was nearly submerged and the bridge between the two lakes was only approximately 0 5 m higher than the lake surface fig 7f notably if the road from shuanghu county to yaqu village is submerged at least dozens of kilometers of new roads will have to be rebuilt along the south and east of tirangbi co one can see that although the lake expansion is a gradual process compared with glacial lake outbursts or other natural hazards it can still pose a major threat to the human living environment and cause great economic loss thirdly rapid lake expansion posed potential threat to residential settlements for example lake level of zhari namco increased unprecedentedly by 2 8 m in 2017 2018 which was close to the total increase between 2000 and 2015 to the southeast of zhari namco the lake level increase has caused the shoreline to move outward by dozens to hundreds of meters a small village with an area of approximately 0 26 km2 is being threatened by the extreme lake expansion fig 8 a b the village was 150 350 m away from zhari namco in october 2016 fig 8c our field expedition showed that it was only 30 130 m away from the lake in may 2021 and was less than 2 m higher than the lake level fig 8d if the lake continues to expand the village will be submerged according to liu et al 2021 drainage reorganization occurred in 2017 in zhari namco basin to the north of zhari namco the rapid expansion of anggu co in 2017 led to its outflow to qige co an upstream lake of zhari namco amplification of the drainage basin further accelerated the rapid lake expansion under the background of climate warming the tp is projected to become warmer and wetter chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 although warmer and wetter climates are beneficial to the ecosystems on the tp the risk of natural hazards may also increase there are already several studies about the impact of lake expansion on the human living environment for example roads and bridges were submerged at qinghai lake cheng et al 2021a b siling co bian et al 2010 and pung co bian et al 2006 a similar situation also occurred in angzi co basin where a village near the lake may be submerged in approximately ten years if the lake level continues to increase wang et al 2019 cheng et al 2022 it is therefore necessary to identify the potential sites threatened by lake expansion on the tp using high resolution satellite images and perform near real time observations of water level changes for these specific lakes including both satellite and in situ observations 4 discussion 4 1 spatial pattern of extreme lake level variations in 2017 2018 the extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 not only occurred in the observed lakes but also in many others on the tp lu et al 2021 jiang et al 2020 zhan et al 2020 using hydroweb and cryosat 2 satellite altimetry data released from crétaux et al 2011 2016 and xu et al 2022 we explored the spatial pattern of the extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 on the tp fig 9 a a total of 54 lakes across the tp were detected on the ctp the contrasting pattern of lake dynamics was confirmed by examining water level variations at more lakes fig 9a to the west of siling co basin most lakes exhibited extreme expansion in 2017 2018 with an average water level increase of 1 7 m for the nine detected lakes e g anglarenco renqingxiubu co tangro yunmco and angzi co such a rapid lake level increase has not occurred since the late 1990s in contrast to the east of siling co basin most lakes exhibited slight lake level fluctuations on an inter annual time scale or even contracted slightly in 2017 2018 fig 9a the levels of the four detected lakes i e nam co zige tangco bam co and pung co decreased by 0 2 m on average during these two years on the northern and northeastern tp lakes also exhibited extreme expansion in 2017 2018 fig 9 on the northern tp the lake level increased by 1 8 m on average for the eight detected lakes e g hol hil lake lexie wudan lake ulan ula lake and ayakkum lake on the northeastern tp the lake level of the five detected lakes e g qinghai lake hala lake gyaring lake and ngoring lake increased by 1 5 m on average the magnitude of lake level increase on the northern tp was even larger than that on the western ctp fig 9a of the 54 detected lakes toson lake in the qaidam basin exhibited the most rapid expansion with lake level increase of 3 m in 2017 2018 rapid lake expansion also occurred in 2016 on the northern tp which was one year earlier than that on the ctp similar rapid lake expansion also occurred in 2002 2004 and 2009 2012 for example the zonag lake outburst in september 2011 followed rapid lake expansion in preceding years which further led to the outburst at kusai lake and haidingnuoer lake downstream yao et al 2012 lu et al 2021 qinghai lake has expanded rapidly since 2004 after a long term lake level decrease since the 1960s li et al 2011 and its water level in 2020 was close to that in the early 1960s cheng et al 2021b on the western tp lakes also exhibited rapid expansion during 2017 2018 the water level of the ten detected lakes e g lumajiangdong co north heishibei lake bangda co and memar co increased by 1 2 m on average in 2017 2018 the rate of lake level increase on the western tp was relatively smaller in the two years compared to those of the lakes on the central and northern tp fig 9a however lakes on the western tp exhibited a steady expansion during the past two decades in contrast to lakes in other regions of the tp qiao et al 2017 li et al 2019 on the southern tp the lakes exhibited contrasting patterns to those on the inner tp most lakes only exhibited slight water level increase or even contracted in 2017 2018 the water levels of the five detected lakes across the southern tp e g yangdro yumco paiku co mangpang yumco and la ng co increased by 0 2 m on average in 2017 2018 this contrasting pattern of lake dynamics between the southern and interior tp has also occurred since the late 1990s lei et al 2014 therefore the extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 is generally consistent with the overall pattern of tp lake dynamics since the late 1990 s except on the eastern ctp 4 2 main causes of the 2017 2018 unprecedented lake expansion studies showed that an increase in precipitation was the primary factor affecting the rapid lake expansion on the tp zhou et al 2015 2022 tong et al 2016 biskop et al 2016 lazhu et al 2016 causes of the extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 are investigated by examining long term changes in air temperature precipitation runoff and lake evaporation on the ctp here we take zhari namco as an example because there is longest interannual lake level change sun et al 2021b fig 10 shows long term lake level changes of zhari namco and the main components of lake water balance since the 1990s one can see that there is close correspondence between precipitation and lake level changes between 1993 and 2020 low precipitation in the 1990s corresponded to a considerable lake level decrease and high precipitation in the 2000s corresponded to a considerable lake level increase notably the precipitation in 2017 and 2018 was the highest during the past three decades which corresponded to an extreme lake level increase meanwhile runoff which is mainly determined by precipitation exhibited a similar pattern with lake level changes fig 10d this indicates that precipitation and the associated runoff were the dominant driver of lake level changes in zhari namco during the past three decades we also examined other factors influencing lake level changes including air temperature and lake evaporation fig 10 the annual mean air temperature increased considerably at a rate of 0 66 c 10 yr at gaize meteorological station there is no close correlation between air temperature and lake level changes changes in permafrost thawing and glacier melting may not be the main factor of the extreme lake expansion because the annua mean air temperature was at a normal level in 2017 2018 long term changes in lake evaporation were investigated using satellite observation and modeling by zhao et al 2022a because lake area increased rapidly during the past years not only evaporation rate but also changes in lake area affected the total water loss from lake surface fig 10b shows that lake evaporation increased rapidly during the past three decades indicating that evaporation considerably suppresses lake expansion lazhu et al 2016 in 2017 and 2018 evaporation amount was relatively high which indicates that it was not the main cause of the rapid lake expansion using a simple linear regression model we found that precipitation runoff and lake evaporation can well reproduce lake level changes during the past three decades r2 0 73 p 0 001 on a larger scale we investigated the spatial distribution of the precipitation anomaly in 2017 2018 using the era5 land monthly averaged dataset fig 9b a comparison between era5 land precipitation and rain gauge data shows that the two datasets have good consistency in dagze co and cedo caka basins fig 5b c thus indicating that era5 precipitation is reliable in reflecting the spatial pattern and long term variations of precipitation in the study area fig 3 fig 9b shows that anomalously high precipitation occurred almost throughout the inner tp in 2017 2018 in contrast with the decrease in precipitation in its southern and eastern regions this spatial pattern is generally consistent with the widespread lake expansion on the interior tp the most remarkable increase in precipitation occurred in the qaidam basin and western ctp where the lake level increased most rapidly fig 9a the slight increase in precipitation also corresponded well with the stable status of lake dynamics on the eastern ctp therefore the unprecedented lake expansion in 2017 2018 was mainly attributed to anomalously high precipitation and the associated runoff on the inner tp 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the processes main causes and environmental impacts of extreme lake expansion in 2017 2018 on the ctp after the considerable lake level decrease in 2015 and subsequent recovery in 2016 lakes on the central and northern tp expanded at unprecedented rate in 2017 2018 in 2017 2018 the water level of the five observed lakes zhari namco dawa co dagze co eya co and cedo caka increased by 2 8 m 1 8 m 2 2 m 1 4 m and 1 8 m respectively the rates of lake level increase were several times larger than the averages in 2003 2009 and 2003 2018 rapid lake expansion was mainly attributed to anomalously high precipitation in situ observations in dagze co and cedo caka basins show that precipitation was approximately 43 97 higher in 2017 2018 than in normal years the extreme lake level increase exerted a substantial influence not only on the geomorphology but also on infrastructure and residential habitats the rapid lake expansion of dawa co led to its connection with qingmuke co substantially affecting the water quality and aquatic ecosystems a small village near zhari namco will soon become inundated if the lake continues to expand infrastructure including road and bridges near cedo caka became inundated and the road from shuanghu to yaqu village will have to be diverted owing to the rapid lake expansion it is necessary to identify the potential sites threatened by lake expansion on the tp using high resolution satellite images and perform near real time observations of lake level changes including both satellite and in situ observations credit

2171,in recent decades the increasing frequency and magnitude of extreme hydrological events due to climate change and human activities have caused substantial economic losses and damages to human wellbeing here we investigated the spatiotemporal variations of streamflow extremes qe and sediment load extremes se in the yellow river yr during 1956 2019 furthermore the effects of main human activities and climate change were identified by establishing quantitative relationships between these factors and changing hydrological extremes specifically the qe and se have decreased significantly p 0 05 since 1956 except the headwater reach above tangnaihai however the qe increased significantly p 0 05 during 2000 2019 due to increased extreme precipitation while the se tended to stabilize at most stations besides the contribution of qe to annual streamflow declined distinctly in the upper middle reaches lanzhou tongguan reach but increased significantly in the lower reaches reach below huayuankou likewise the contribution of se to annual sediment load increased remarkably in the middle lower reaches huayuankou lijin reach furthermore the timing of qe and se generally tended to disperse from the flood season to the four seasons while extreme precipitation fundamentally caused the extreme water and sediment discharge the magnitude and hazard of qe and se can be strongly regulated by human activities particularly mainstream dams can artificially regulate qe and se magnitudes and relationships and reduce their synchronization probability and intra basin engineering construction and revegetation measures can substantially reduce their possible peaks in a power function form in addition changes in the extreme water sediment relationships indicated that declining erosive power in the middle reaches and decreasing sediment availability in the lower reaches dominated se reduction this study provides a scientific basis for flood risk management and water resources development and utilization in large complex river basins keywords hydrological extremes spatiotemporal variations synchronization probability climate change human activities data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction significant changes have occurred in the fluxes of water discharge and sediment load in many large river systems worldwide due to climate change and anthropogenic activities milly et al 2005 kummu varis 2007 cohen et al 2014 best 2018 li et al 2021 syvitski et al 2022 the global climate has changed rapidly over the last 100 years with increasing temperatures and extreme precipitation frequency ipcc 2022 flooding events due to increasingly frequent heavy rainfall have increased the threat to the production and livelihood of people along the riverbank leading to a large number of deaths and severe social and environmental problems allen ingram 2002 kundzewicz and matczak 2015 arnell et al 2016 floods also trigger various secondary disasters such as landslides mudslides and waterlogging and undermine social and economic development chen et al 2012 jongman et al 2014 increasingly intense anthropogenic activities including dam and reservoir construction land use changes and human water consumption have also significantly altered the extreme hydrological characteristics of river basins around the world walling 2006 cohen et al 2014 gudmundsson et al 2021 therefore it is crucial to analyze the variations of extreme fluvial streamflow and sediment load to better predict future changes in the world s water resources and extreme hydrological changes previous studies indicated that a significant portion of the global watershed area has already experienced extreme high and low flow variability asadieh krakauer 2017 rutkowska et al 2017 dethier et al 2020 gudmundsson et al 2021 such as the north american river basins dethier et al 2020 the lena river basin in northern eurasia tananaev et al 2016 and the upper wisława river basin in poland rutkowska et al 2017 based on multiple hydrologic models asadieh and krakauer 2017 concluded that approximately 37 of the global land area experienced an increase 24 5 on average in very high flows and 43 of the land area experienced decreases 51 5 on average in very low flows these studies depicted a global map of extreme flow changes however less attention has been paid to extreme sediment load variability due to the lack of long term fine scale data e g daily scale in addition some other studies have used sediment rating curves to estimate suspended sediment concentration or to characterize sediment concentration load across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales e g sheridan et al 2011 ouellet proulx et al 2016 juez et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 however the variation of the water sediment relationship under extreme hydrological conditions and the concurrency of extreme water and sediment fluxes remains poorly understood previous studies on extreme hydrological events focused primarily on extreme streamflow fekete et al 2012 clilverd et al 2019 folton et al 2019 and there are some gaps in examining extreme changes in sediment load and water sediment relationship and synchronicity the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events e g floods and droughts were driven by climate change or anthropogenic perturbations gudmundsson et al 2018 curran biles 2021 heavy rainfall is commonly an important factor in the discharge of large amounts of water or sediment in a short period from the catchment nearing et al 2005 walling 2006 huang et al 2021 which is confirmed by the occurrence of floods that usually coincides with extreme precipitation events ran et al 2020 it is also substantiated that anthropogenic factors such as reservoir flood regulation and artificial water extraction are the causal drivers of trends in mean and extreme river flow at the global scale gudmundsson et al 2021 xu et al 2022 nevertheless quantitative studies on the causes of extreme streamflow or sediment load changes are usually conducted through model simulations which are lacking in quantitative results derived from observation data additionally the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on the hydrological regimes of a watershed are usually irreversible peterson et al 2021 for example the sediment flux from the mississippi river basin has decreased to a historical low because of intense human activities including dam and reservoir construction and agricultural activities heimann et al 2011 yin et al 2023 hence although extreme streamflow and sediment load are known to be influenced by a combination of extreme climate change and anthropogenic activities the extent to which different regions across the watershed are affected and the underlying regulating mechanisms remain largely unknown because of extensive agricultural activities intensive dam and reservoir construction significant land use land cover changes and unique geomorphological features the yellow river yr provides an excellent example for studying extreme streamflow and sediment load under the influence of climate change and human activities wang et al 2016 wu et al 2021 wang sun 2021 moreover the yellow river basin yrb supports 12 of china s population in particular the downstream rivers of the yrb flow through densely populated plains coupled with its hanging river landform which undoubtedly aggravates the risk of flooding therefore it is quite important to study the changes in the extreme streamflow and sediment load of the yr currently several studies have investigated the changes in downstream streamflow extremes due to dam regulation kong et al 2022 wu et al 2021 the maximum daily runoff depth and suspended sediment yield on the loess plateau zheng et al 2020 and the mechanism of the annual maximum flood or sediment event generation in the middle upper reaches ran et al 2020 in the yrb however there is still a lack of understanding of the integrated picture of the long term changes in extreme streamflow and sediment load and their water sediment relationships in the whole basin furthermore there are some knowledge gaps on the mechanisms of anthropogenic activities and climate change in influencing extreme streamflow and sediment load e g synchronicity and heterogeneity therefore it is essential to examine the characteristics and causes of the changing water sediment extremes in large river basins based on daily streamflow and sediment load data during 1956 2019 in the mainstream and tributaries of the yrb our objectives are to 1 quantify the spatial and temporal variations of extreme streamflow and sediment load 2 investigate the changes in the water sediment relationship and synchronization of extreme streamflow and sediment load and 3 establish quantitative relationships to examine the effects of climate change and human activities on the variations of extreme streamflow and sediment load to our best knowledge this study is the first time to provide an integrated and detailed picture of the changes in extreme streamflow and sediment load and their water sediment relationships in the yrb and to obtain several important quantitative relationships between changing hydrological extremes and main human activities factors 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yr originates from the bayan hara mountains on the qinghai tibet plateau flows through the inner mongolia plateau loess plateau and yellow huai plain from west to east and finally drains into the bohai sea spanning arid semi arid and semi humid areas from headwater to the delta fig 1 the yr has a drainage area of about 75 2 104 km2 and a length of 5464 km with the multi year 1956 2019 average streamflow sediment load and precipitation of 27 4 km3 yr 1 598 5 mt yr 1 and 488 0 mm yr 1 yin et al 2021 based on hydrological and geomorphological features the yrb is divided into the upper middle and lower reaches with the toudaoguai and huayuankou hydrological stations as the boundary points fig 1 the source area the upper middle and lower reaches refer to the reach above tangnaihai lanzhou toudaoguai reach toudaoguai huayuankou reach and huayuankou lijin reach respectively the middle upper reaches lanzhou tongguan reach are dominated by mountains while the lower reaches are characterized by plains and hills the midstream of the yr flows through the loess plateau with intense soil erosion of a multi year average erosion rate of 1892 4 tons km 2 yr 1 and the lower yr plain exhibits flat landscapes and is susceptible to sediment deposition of a multi year average deposition rate of 420 7 tons km 2 yr 1 yin et al 2021 in addition there are several mainstream large dams regulating the streamflow and sediment load such as the longyangxia dam 27 6 km3 of maximum capacity below the tangnaihai station and the xiaolangdi dam 12 7 km3 of maximum capacity above the huayuankou station fig 1 2 2 data sources daily streamflow and sediment load data at six hydrological stations along the mainstream yr from 1956 to 2019 were collected from the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources yrcc fig 2 the gauge stations include tangnaihai source area lanzhou and toudaoguai in the upper reaches tongguan and huayuankou in the middle reaches and lijin in the lower reaches fig 1 daily streamflow data at the tangnaihai and lanzhou stations in 1998 and 1999 and daily sediment load data at the tangnaihai station in 1998 and 1999 and at the lanzhou station in 1963 and during 1998 2005 are missing in addition we also collected daily streamflow and sediment load data from the tributaries in the toudaoguai tongguan reach on the loess plateau from the 1950 s to 2019 to explore the effect of soil conservation measures on streamflow and sediment load extremes fig 1 and table s1 the daily streamflow and sediment load from the toudaoguai tongguan reach can be obtained by summing the daily streamflow and sediment load of tributaries in the reach detailed information on measurements of streamflow and sediment load refer to yin et al 2021 the gridded precipitation data from 1956 to 2019 was developed by combining the daily precipitation measurements at 315 stations in the yrb with the digital elevation model resolution of 0 5 0 5 https data cma cn the reservoir data in the midstream yrb from 1956 to 2011 were obtained from the yrcc including the year when dams were constructed and completed and the corresponding reservoir storage capacity and location yin et al 2021 the area treated by check dams terraces grass plantation and afforestation in the toudaoguai tongguan reach in 1959 1969 1979 1989 1999 and 2006 table s2 were obtained from ran et al 2000 yao et al 2011 and ran et al 2012 2 3 methods 2 3 1 detection of trends and change points the daily streamflow greater than the 90th percentile was defined as a high value during a year by some researchers gudmundsson et al 2019 gudmundsson et al 2021 besides floods with high sediment concentrations in the yrb are more hazardous zheng et al 2020 ran et al 2020 hence the streamflow extremes qe and sediment load extremes se in this study were defined as the values exceeding the 95th percentile during a year asadieh and krakauer 2017 to reflect the annual extremely high streamflow or sediment load characteristics fig 2 the same is true for the definition of extreme precipitation the bootstrap based nonparametric mann kendal test was used to detect the trend and change point in a hydrological series or climate series data mann 1945 kendall 1975 yue pilon 2004 and the slopes were computed using sen s slope estimator sen 1968 pettitt s test approach pettitt 1979 is commonly applied to detect a single change point to avoid possible uncertainty and misleading results based on one individual method the assembled change points were obtained by using the two methods in this study we analyze the trends and change points of the annual qe and se which are the sums of the qe and se during a year the breakpoints of annual qe in the 1980 s and those of annual se in around 1999 were obtained hence the study period was divided into three stages i e 1956 1979 p1 1980 1999 p2 and 2000 2019 p3 2 3 2 analysis of synchronicity between extreme streamflow and sediment load the synchronization pattern of qe and se was explored by using the polar coordinate grid for the occurrence dates and analyzing the synchronization probability occurring on the same day the polar coordinate grid method demonstrates the changes in the distribution of qe and se in each month during the three stages which allows a concise comparison of the possible changes in the distribution of extreme occurrence dates relevant calculations and graphing are implemented in rstudio in addition we defined the synchronization probability of qe and se as the number of days out of 365 366 in a year that qe and se occur on the same day if all qe and se occur on the same day the synchronization probability is the maximum i e 5 the synchronization probability of qe and se in the three stages is calculated using copulas i e joint distribution function fitting between two or more time independent variable best fit functions of copula families including more than twenty functions of gaussian t clayton frank and so on smakhtin 2001 favre et al 2004 a copula can be informally defined as a mapping tool from i 2 f g to i h nelsen 2003 when f x g y h x y is a point in i 3 i 0 1 x and y are then continuous random variables with distribution functions f x p x x and g y p y y and h x y p x x y y is a function that describes their joint distribution sadegh et al 2017 the copula is an approach from the cohort of several multivariate analysis methods and is widely used to model the dependence structure of two or more random variables de michele salvadori 2003 renard lang 2007 jongman et al 2014 relevant calculations and graphing are implemented in matlab 2 3 3 analysis of streamflow sediment load relationship the sediment rating curve which presents the relationship between streamflow and suspended sediment concentration by linear power and polynomial functions has been widely applied in previous studies sheridan et al 2011 gao et al 2017 the most common expression of the sediment rating curve is a power function syvitski et al 2000 sheridan et al 2011 here the relationship between streamflow q and sediment load s was described as a power function 1 s aq b where a and b are regression coefficients the rating coefficient a generally represents soil erodibility and sediment source availability and a high a value indicates intensively weathered materials that can be easily eroded the coefficient b has been generally assumed to represent erosive power and a high b value indicates that a slight increase in discharge can result in a strong increase in sediment transport we established the streamflow sediment load relationships under extreme conditions where extreme streamflow or sediment load occurred and under non extreme conditions therefore the sensitivity of qe and se to soil erodibility and river flow erosivity can be tested by the coefficients of the sediment rating curve 3 results 3 1 trends of extreme streamflow and sediment load the average annual qe during the period 1956 2019 increased from the upstream 31 6 108 m3 to the midstream 53 0 108 m3 and downstream 51 4 108 m3 of the yrb which were calculated by averaging the annual qe and se values of gauging stations in each sub basin table 1 the average annual se first increased from the upstream 20 7 mt to the midstream 369 6 mt and then decreased to the downstream 225 6 mt in addition the contribution of annual qe to the annual total streamflow increased from the upstream 13 5 to the midstream 15 5 and downstream 18 8 while the contribution of annual se to the annual total sediment load was 41 6 45 4 and 37 7 in the upstream midstream and downstream respectively which was much higher than that of qe the trends of annual qe and se exhibited pronounced spatiotemporal variations fig 3 and table 2 from 1956 to 2019 the qe and se significantly reduced p 0 001 in the upper middle and lower reaches but the decreases in qe and se in the source area were not significant in contrast to the decreasing trend during the whole study period the qe at the upstream stations during the p1 period 1956 1979 tended to increase p 0 01 and qe at all stations during the p3 period 2000 2019 increased significantly p 0 01 the se during the p1 and p2 1980 1999 periods showed variable trends decreasing or increasing at different stations while the interannual variation of se gradually stabilized at most stations and even slightly increased at the toudaoguai station since 2000 in addition the contribution of qe to annual streamflow gradually decreased at all stations except the lijin station where the contribution increased significantly p 0 05 table 2 the contribution of se to annual sediment load at the stations above the huayuankou station showed an insignificant decreasing trend while the contribution at the huayuankou and lijin stations increased significantly p 0 05 the relationships of qe or se between adjacent stations are shown in fig 4 overall the linear relationship of qe or se between adjacent stations is significant p 0 05 with r 2 0 69 which indicates good transferability of the extreme streamflow or sediment load between adjacent stations only the relationship of the se between the lanzhou and tangnaihai stations is not so good r 2 0 44 p 0 05 in addition by comparing the slope of the linear relationships the differences of both qe and se between the tongguan and toudaoguai stations are most significant among the adjacent stations as the tributaries from the loess plateau contributed huge amounts of streamflow and sediment table s1 3 2 synchronicity of extreme streamflow and sediment load the intra annual distribution of qe and se dates from 1956 to 2019 tends to disperse from the flood season july to september to the four seasons fig 5 and figure s1 the qe dates at the tangnaihai and lanzhou stations of the upper reaches concentrated in july september during the p1 period while those tended to occur in june october during the p2 and p3 periods the distribution of qe dates along the yr mainstream from toudaoguai to lijin is similar during the p1 and p2 periods i e the dates during p1 are concentrated in august september while those during p2 in the flood season especially august with a small distribution in march the qe dates during the p3 period are more dispersed such as a qe distribution from march october at the huayuankou station the se dates during p1 and p2 are mainly in the flood season mostly july and august except at the toudaoguai station where approximately 16 9 of se occurred in march during the p2 period during p3 the se dates at the tangnaihai and lanzhou stations are still in the flood season while those at the stations below the lanzhou station partially occurred in spring march and april especially for the toudaoguai station furthermore comparing the timing of qe and se the proportion of their monthly distribution is not exactly consistent especially at the lanzhou station fig 5 the synchronization probability of qe and se occurring on the same day of a year decreased from p1 to p2 in the upstream while that in the middle and lower reaches increased fig 6 from p2 to p3 the synchronization probability increased at the lanzhou and toudaoguai stations while that in the river source area and mid lower reaches decreased specifically the synchronization probability from p1 to p2 and p3 decreased at the tangnaihai and lanzhou stations changed insignificantly at the toudaoguai station and peaked during p2 in the mainstream below the toudaoguai station spatially the synchronization probability of 1 8 at the lanzhou station in periods p2 and p3 was the lowest and the synchronization probability increased from the middle reaches to the lower reaches 3 3 water sediment relationships under extreme and non extreme conditions there are pronounced differences and spatiotemporal variability in the coefficients a and b of the sediment rating curves under extreme and non extreme conditions across the yrb table 3 and table s3 relative to the non extremes the rating coefficient a in the water sediment relationship under extreme conditions distinctly increased whereas the rating coefficient b and the fitting r 2 decreased markedly table 3 indicating larger soil erodibility and sediment source availability reduced variability in erosive power and thus unstable water sediment relationships these also demonstrate the existence of a threshold such as the flow below some value in stable water sediment relationships the changes of the rating coefficients a and b during the three stages were similar for extreme and non extreme conditions only at the tangnainai and toudaoguai stations the rating coefficient a decreased from p1 to p2 and increased from p2 to p3 at the tangnaihai station but the coefficient b changed in opposite directions while these changes at the toudaoguai were the opposite to those at the tangnaihai station under extreme conditions the changes in the rating coefficients a and b at the huayuankou station were the same as those at the toudaoguai station the rating coefficient a at the lanzhou and tongguan stations gradually increased from p1 to p2 then to p3 and the rating coefficient b decreased and these changes at the lijin station were the opposite as a representative station of the main sediment source the variation of the rating coefficients a and b at the tongguan station indicated that soil erodibility and sediment source availability in the middle reaches gradually increased and erosive power variability gradually decreased from p1 to p2 then to p3 nevertheless the erosive power variability increased in the lower reaches lijin station and the soil erodibility and sediment source availability decreased due to the regulation of the xiaolangdi dam 4 discussion 4 1 impact of climate change on variations of streamflow and sediment load extremes extreme precipitation and the resulting floods landslides and gully erosion are important drivers and material sources of extreme water and sediment discharge into the river li et al 2020 this can be reflected by the recent extreme rainfall triggered flood and high magnitude sediment events in the middle yellow river in 2017 gao et al 2018 the important role of extreme precipitation in driving streamflow and sediment load extremes can also be statistically confirmed by the good correlations r 2 0 5 between the monthly maximum daily streamflow at the tangnaihai station during p1 p2 and p3 and the monthly maximum daily sediment load at the tangnaihai station during p1 with the cumulative 10 day precipitation before the dates of these monthly maximums table 4 these good power function correlation relationships with precipitation are also associated with minimal anthropogenic disturbances in the yellow river source area li et al 2021 ran et al 2020 also reported that flood occurrence usually coincides with extreme precipitation events and extreme sediment events are more closely related to precipitation than to water discharge in the middle reaches i e the loess plateau besides despite the overall trend of increasing precipitation from 1956 to 2019 table s4 the qe and se have significantly decreased p 0 05 table 2 indicating a gradual decreasing flood risk furthermore the extreme precipitation was distinctly greater at all stations during p3 than during p2 fig 7 while the qe and se reduced greatly from p2 to p3 fig 3 nevertheless although the flood risk in the yrb has become much lower in the last two decades than in the 1950 s the recently increasing frequency and magnitude of the heavy rainstorm fig s2 and extreme streamflow suggest that it remains a nonnegligible risk 4 2 impact of human activities on variations of streamflow and sediment load extremes human activities are the dominant factors in decreasing the annual streamflow and sediment load in the yellow river by intercepting water and sediment mainly through mainstream dam construction intra basin engineering construction reservoirs terraces and check dams and vegetation restoration measures grass plantation and afforestation rustomji et al 2008 lu et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 song et al 2020 hammond et al 2021 it is reasonable to infer that these human activities have also reduced the annual qe and se on a daily scale ran et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 xu et al 2021 however different human activities such as mainstream dam construction and intra basin soil conservation measures may have changed the qe and se in different ways on the one hand mainstream dam construction has different impacts on the variations of qe and se firstly there are different influences of a dam with different functions and roles on the resilience of qe and se and their relationships at the station below the dam fig 8 such as the longyangxia dam above lanzhou completed in 1989 chang et al 2022 and the xiaolangdi dam above huayuankou completed in 1999 kong et al 2015 the qe transport ratio between lanzhou and tangnaihai decreased after 1989 and did not recover afterward and the se transport ratio increased after 1989 and decreased after 1999 to the pre dam level fig 8 while the changes at the huayuankou station were just the opposite in addition the suspended sediment concentration also substantially shifted from the pre dam to the post dam period with an increase of 76 at the lanzhou station and a decrease of 80 3 at the huayuankou station fig 8 which can be attributed to the unique operation of xiaolangdi reservoir in the water and sediment regulation period kong et al 2022 secondly the water sediment regulation by reservoirs and dams can artificially change the synchronization of qe and se from the pre dam to the post dam period the timing of qe and se at the lanzhou and huayuankou stations changed to be generally dispersed fig s3 besides the synchronization probability of qe and se at the two stations lowered fig 9 due to the time staggered water and sediment regulation by dams according to different functional requirements such as power generation flood control silt reduction and agricultural irrigation therefore water sediment regulation by operating mainstream dams and reservoirs can lower high peaks raise low troughs as needed and change the patterns of streamflow and sediment load kong et al 2022 on the other hand intra basin reservoirs construction and soil conservation measures including afforestation grass plantation construction of terraces on hillslopes and construction of check dams on river channels can lead to gradual decreases in qe and se in a power function form these intra basin engineering and vegetation construction reduced runoff yield and soil erosion from precipitation and retained streamflow and sediment within the catchment wang et al 2016 fu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 spatially the maximum increment of se mainly occurred in the toudaoguai tongguan reach in the loess plateau the primary sediment yielding region table 1 therefore several good quantitative power function relationships between qe and se with the proportional area of these measures and cumulative reservoir capacity in the toudaoguai tongguan reach were established fig 10 with the increasing proportional area of various soil conservation measures e g check dams terraces grass plantation and afforestation and reservoir capacity the qe or se dropped to a quasi equilibrium state as a power function r 2 0 78 however under the same increase of proportional area the check dams and grass plantation resulted in a higher decrease in qe and se than terraces fig 10a and 10e and afforestation fig 10b and 10f respectively overall engineering measures resulted in a higher decrease in qe and se than vegetation restoration measures fig 10c and 10g additionally there may be divergent trends between qe and se over the same period due to different roles of dam construction engineering construction and vegetation restoration measures for example qe decreased but se increased during the period p2 at the lanzhou and tongguan stations fig 3 as mentioned above the construction of dams reservoirs and terraces directly retained sediment and drastically reduced se from p1 to p2 yet their sediment reduction efficiency would decrease year by year with the decreasing storage capacity and some retained sediment would be exported into downstream wang et al 2016 leading to a slow increase in se during p2 in contrast the impacts of check dams terraces and vegetation cover changes on fluvial streamflow is mostly a continuous and gradual process of reduction bao et al 2019 wang et al 2019 which will hinder the yield of runoff peak leading to a gradual decrease in se 4 3 implications for basin management the world s large river basins are often paramount homes for humans due to the demand for water and natural resources allan castillo 2007 de jalón et al 2017 however people living along rivers usually suffer the risk of flooding jongman et al 2014 humans thus commonly use hydraulic engineering soil conservation measures and vegetation restoration measures syvitski et al 2005 cohen et al 2014 to transform and manage watersheds to eliminate river risk and maximize water and sediment resources however the single implementation of these engineering measures cannot fully achieve these goals for example the large scale dam construction on the mainstream yr can substantially regulate the flow and suspended sediment concentration but also result in downstream riverbed incision due to the hungry water effect kondolf 1997 hu et al 2022 thus lowering low flow water levels and raising difficulties in water extraction for rivers below dams kong et al 2015 besides because of the dam s sediment retention effect deltas have further suffered from an increased risk of retreat and coastal erosion in addition the engineering measures can directly retain water and sediment but they play a relatively small part in decreasing the non extreme streamflow or sediment load for example there was a sudden reduction in se after 1980 at the tongguan station fig s4 but no sudden decrease in annual sediment load yin et al 2021 notably the se at the tongguan station increased slowly during 1980 1999 fig 3 probably due to the decreasing storage capacity of check dams wang et al 2016 accordingly the water and sediment reduction effect of soil conservation measures after 2000 was weaker than the water and sediment increase effect of markedly increasing extreme precipitation fig 7 leading to the trend of increasing qe and gradually stable se during 2000 2019 fig 3 streamflow is a major source of human water consumption which can reduce streamflow directly wang et al 2019 found that human water consumption contributed more than 90 to annual streamflow reduction between the 1950s and the 1980s in the yr which is consistent with our results of a sharp decrease in extreme hydrological values at most stations fig 3 thus human water extraction is also a non negligible factor in changing the qe and se song et al 2020 for example the qe and se in the lower reaches especially at the lijin station decreased significantly p 0 05 but the contribution of the extremes to the annual fluxes tended to increase from p1 to p3 this was due largely to the limitation of water extraction technology such as the limited water pumping power resulting in a smaller water diversion ratio in extreme cases than that in non extreme cases assuming that the daily water and sediment diversions are kept constant as a result water extraction activities have a much smaller impact on the water sediment extremes than non extremes these results provide insights into how to separately or jointly adopt soil conservation measures vegetation restoration measures and mainstream dam operations in the whole basin to improve the existing watershed management measures and achieve sustainable water utilization 5 conclusions this study innovatively investigated the long term changes in magnitudes relationships and synchronicity of extreme streamflow and sediment load from the basin wide perspective and filled the knowledge gap in the quantitative influences of major human activities on extreme streamflow and sediment load changes we found that extreme streamflow and sediment load have decreased significantly since the 1950 s except for the insignificant decrease in the yellow river source region however the extreme streamflow increased significantly during 2000 2019 while the extreme sediment load tended to stabilize at most stations furthermore the occurrence dates of extreme streamflow and sediment load tended to disperse from the flood season to the four seasons of a year there is strong evidence that the fundamental drivers of extreme water and sediment discharges are extreme precipitation events nevertheless the magnitude and hazard characteristics of streamflow and sediment load extremes can be strongly regulated by anthropogenic activities we highlight that mainstream dam operations can artificially change and control the streamflow and sediment load extremes water sediment relationships and extreme water sediment synchronization while intra basin anthropogenic engineering and vegetation measures can decrease the peak flood to get more detailed mechanisms of anthropogenic activities and climate change in influencing extreme streamflow and sediment load we will consider

2171,in recent decades the increasing frequency and magnitude of extreme hydrological events due to climate change and human activities have caused substantial economic losses and damages to human wellbeing here we investigated the spatiotemporal variations of streamflow extremes qe and sediment load extremes se in the yellow river yr during 1956 2019 furthermore the effects of main human activities and climate change were identified by establishing quantitative relationships between these factors and changing hydrological extremes specifically the qe and se have decreased significantly p 0 05 since 1956 except the headwater reach above tangnaihai however the qe increased significantly p 0 05 during 2000 2019 due to increased extreme precipitation while the se tended to stabilize at most stations besides the contribution of qe to annual streamflow declined distinctly in the upper middle reaches lanzhou tongguan reach but increased significantly in the lower reaches reach below huayuankou likewise the contribution of se to annual sediment load increased remarkably in the middle lower reaches huayuankou lijin reach furthermore the timing of qe and se generally tended to disperse from the flood season to the four seasons while extreme precipitation fundamentally caused the extreme water and sediment discharge the magnitude and hazard of qe and se can be strongly regulated by human activities particularly mainstream dams can artificially regulate qe and se magnitudes and relationships and reduce their synchronization probability and intra basin engineering construction and revegetation measures can substantially reduce their possible peaks in a power function form in addition changes in the extreme water sediment relationships indicated that declining erosive power in the middle reaches and decreasing sediment availability in the lower reaches dominated se reduction this study provides a scientific basis for flood risk management and water resources development and utilization in large complex river basins keywords hydrological extremes spatiotemporal variations synchronization probability climate change human activities data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction significant changes have occurred in the fluxes of water discharge and sediment load in many large river systems worldwide due to climate change and anthropogenic activities milly et al 2005 kummu varis 2007 cohen et al 2014 best 2018 li et al 2021 syvitski et al 2022 the global climate has changed rapidly over the last 100 years with increasing temperatures and extreme precipitation frequency ipcc 2022 flooding events due to increasingly frequent heavy rainfall have increased the threat to the production and livelihood of people along the riverbank leading to a large number of deaths and severe social and environmental problems allen ingram 2002 kundzewicz and matczak 2015 arnell et al 2016 floods also trigger various secondary disasters such as landslides mudslides and waterlogging and undermine social and economic development chen et al 2012 jongman et al 2014 increasingly intense anthropogenic activities including dam and reservoir construction land use changes and human water consumption have also significantly altered the extreme hydrological characteristics of river basins around the world walling 2006 cohen et al 2014 gudmundsson et al 2021 therefore it is crucial to analyze the variations of extreme fluvial streamflow and sediment load to better predict future changes in the world s water resources and extreme hydrological changes previous studies indicated that a significant portion of the global watershed area has already experienced extreme high and low flow variability asadieh krakauer 2017 rutkowska et al 2017 dethier et al 2020 gudmundsson et al 2021 such as the north american river basins dethier et al 2020 the lena river basin in northern eurasia tananaev et al 2016 and the upper wisława river basin in poland rutkowska et al 2017 based on multiple hydrologic models asadieh and krakauer 2017 concluded that approximately 37 of the global land area experienced an increase 24 5 on average in very high flows and 43 of the land area experienced decreases 51 5 on average in very low flows these studies depicted a global map of extreme flow changes however less attention has been paid to extreme sediment load variability due to the lack of long term fine scale data e g daily scale in addition some other studies have used sediment rating curves to estimate suspended sediment concentration or to characterize sediment concentration load across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales e g sheridan et al 2011 ouellet proulx et al 2016 juez et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 however the variation of the water sediment relationship under extreme hydrological conditions and the concurrency of extreme water and sediment fluxes remains poorly understood previous studies on extreme hydrological events focused primarily on extreme streamflow fekete et al 2012 clilverd et al 2019 folton et al 2019 and there are some gaps in examining extreme changes in sediment load and water sediment relationship and synchronicity the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events e g floods and droughts were driven by climate change or anthropogenic perturbations gudmundsson et al 2018 curran biles 2021 heavy rainfall is commonly an important factor in the discharge of large amounts of water or sediment in a short period from the catchment nearing et al 2005 walling 2006 huang et al 2021 which is confirmed by the occurrence of floods that usually coincides with extreme precipitation events ran et al 2020 it is also substantiated that anthropogenic factors such as reservoir flood regulation and artificial water extraction are the causal drivers of trends in mean and extreme river flow at the global scale gudmundsson et al 2021 xu et al 2022 nevertheless quantitative studies on the causes of extreme streamflow or sediment load changes are usually conducted through model simulations which are lacking in quantitative results derived from observation data additionally the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on the hydrological regimes of a watershed are usually irreversible peterson et al 2021 for example the sediment flux from the mississippi river basin has decreased to a historical low because of intense human activities including dam and reservoir construction and agricultural activities heimann et al 2011 yin et al 2023 hence although extreme streamflow and sediment load are known to be influenced by a combination of extreme climate change and anthropogenic activities the extent to which different regions across the watershed are affected and the underlying regulating mechanisms remain largely unknown because of extensive agricultural activities intensive dam and reservoir construction significant land use land cover changes and unique geomorphological features the yellow river yr provides an excellent example for studying extreme streamflow and sediment load under the influence of climate change and human activities wang et al 2016 wu et al 2021 wang sun 2021 moreover the yellow river basin yrb supports 12 of china s population in particular the downstream rivers of the yrb flow through densely populated plains coupled with its hanging river landform which undoubtedly aggravates the risk of flooding therefore it is quite important to study the changes in the extreme streamflow and sediment load of the yr currently several studies have investigated the changes in downstream streamflow extremes due to dam regulation kong et al 2022 wu et al 2021 the maximum daily runoff depth and suspended sediment yield on the loess plateau zheng et al 2020 and the mechanism of the annual maximum flood or sediment event generation in the middle upper reaches ran et al 2020 in the yrb however there is still a lack of understanding of the integrated picture of the long term changes in extreme streamflow and sediment load and their water sediment relationships in the whole basin furthermore there are some knowledge gaps on the mechanisms of anthropogenic activities and climate change in influencing extreme streamflow and sediment load e g synchronicity and heterogeneity therefore it is essential to examine the characteristics and causes of the changing water sediment extremes in large river basins based on daily streamflow and sediment load data during 1956 2019 in the mainstream and tributaries of the yrb our objectives are to 1 quantify the spatial and temporal variations of extreme streamflow and sediment load 2 investigate the changes in the water sediment relationship and synchronization of extreme streamflow and sediment load and 3 establish quantitative relationships to examine the effects of climate change and human activities on the variations of extreme streamflow and sediment load to our best knowledge this study is the first time to provide an integrated and detailed picture of the changes in extreme streamflow and sediment load and their water sediment relationships in the yrb and to obtain several important quantitative relationships between changing hydrological extremes and main human activities factors 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yr originates from the bayan hara mountains on the qinghai tibet plateau flows through the inner mongolia plateau loess plateau and yellow huai plain from west to east and finally drains into the bohai sea spanning arid semi arid and semi humid areas from headwater to the delta fig 1 the yr has a drainage area of about 75 2 104 km2 and a length of 5464 km with the multi year 1956 2019 average streamflow sediment load and precipitation of 27 4 km3 yr 1 598 5 mt yr 1 and 488 0 mm yr 1 yin et al 2021 based on hydrological and geomorphological features the yrb is divided into the upper middle and lower reaches with the toudaoguai and huayuankou hydrological stations as the boundary points fig 1 the source area the upper middle and lower reaches refer to the reach above tangnaihai lanzhou toudaoguai reach toudaoguai huayuankou reach and huayuankou lijin reach respectively the middle upper reaches lanzhou tongguan reach are dominated by mountains while the lower reaches are characterized by plains and hills the midstream of the yr flows through the loess plateau with intense soil erosion of a multi year average erosion rate of 1892 4 tons km 2 yr 1 and the lower yr plain exhibits flat landscapes and is susceptible to sediment deposition of a multi year average deposition rate of 420 7 tons km 2 yr 1 yin et al 2021 in addition there are several mainstream large dams regulating the streamflow and sediment load such as the longyangxia dam 27 6 km3 of maximum capacity below the tangnaihai station and the xiaolangdi dam 12 7 km3 of maximum capacity above the huayuankou station fig 1 2 2 data sources daily streamflow and sediment load data at six hydrological stations along the mainstream yr from 1956 to 2019 were collected from the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources yrcc fig 2 the gauge stations include tangnaihai source area lanzhou and toudaoguai in the upper reaches tongguan and huayuankou in the middle reaches and lijin in the lower reaches fig 1 daily streamflow data at the tangnaihai and lanzhou stations in 1998 and 1999 and daily sediment load data at the tangnaihai station in 1998 and 1999 and at the lanzhou station in 1963 and during 1998 2005 are missing in addition we also collected daily streamflow and sediment load data from the tributaries in the toudaoguai tongguan reach on the loess plateau from the 1950 s to 2019 to explore the effect of soil conservation measures on streamflow and sediment load extremes fig 1 and table s1 the daily streamflow and sediment load from the toudaoguai tongguan reach can be obtained by summing the daily streamflow and sediment load of tributaries in the reach detailed information on measurements of streamflow and sediment load refer to yin et al 2021 the gridded precipitation data from 1956 to 2019 was developed by combining the daily precipitation measurements at 315 stations in the yrb with the digital elevation model resolution of 0 5 0 5 https data cma cn the reservoir data in the midstream yrb from 1956 to 2011 were obtained from the yrcc including the year when dams were constructed and completed and the corresponding reservoir storage capacity and location yin et al 2021 the area treated by check dams terraces grass plantation and afforestation in the toudaoguai tongguan reach in 1959 1969 1979 1989 1999 and 2006 table s2 were obtained from ran et al 2000 yao et al 2011 and ran et al 2012 2 3 methods 2 3 1 detection of trends and change points the daily streamflow greater than the 90th percentile was defined as a high value during a year by some researchers gudmundsson et al 2019 gudmundsson et al 2021 besides floods with high sediment concentrations in the yrb are more hazardous zheng et al 2020 ran et al 2020 hence the streamflow extremes qe and sediment load extremes se in this study were defined as the values exceeding the 95th percentile during a year asadieh and krakauer 2017 to reflect the annual extremely high streamflow or sediment load characteristics fig 2 the same is true for the definition of extreme precipitation the bootstrap based nonparametric mann kendal test was used to detect the trend and change point in a hydrological series or climate series data mann 1945 kendall 1975 yue pilon 2004 and the slopes were computed using sen s slope estimator sen 1968 pettitt s test approach pettitt 1979 is commonly applied to detect a single change point to avoid possible uncertainty and misleading results based on one individual method the assembled change points were obtained by using the two methods in this study we analyze the trends and change points of the annual qe and se which are the sums of the qe and se during a year the breakpoints of annual qe in the 1980 s and those of annual se in around 1999 were obtained hence the study period was divided into three stages i e 1956 1979 p1 1980 1999 p2 and 2000 2019 p3 2 3 2 analysis of synchronicity between extreme streamflow and sediment load the synchronization pattern of qe and se was explored by using the polar coordinate grid for the occurrence dates and analyzing the synchronization probability occurring on the same day the polar coordinate grid method demonstrates the changes in the distribution of qe and se in each month during the three stages which allows a concise comparison of the possible changes in the distribution of extreme occurrence dates relevant calculations and graphing are implemented in rstudio in addition we defined the synchronization probability of qe and se as the number of days out of 365 366 in a year that qe and se occur on the same day if all qe and se occur on the same day the synchronization probability is the maximum i e 5 the synchronization probability of qe and se in the three stages is calculated using copulas i e joint distribution function fitting between two or more time independent variable best fit functions of copula families including more than twenty functions of gaussian t clayton frank and so on smakhtin 2001 favre et al 2004 a copula can be informally defined as a mapping tool from i 2 f g to i h nelsen 2003 when f x g y h x y is a point in i 3 i 0 1 x and y are then continuous random variables with distribution functions f x p x x and g y p y y and h x y p x x y y is a function that describes their joint distribution sadegh et al 2017 the copula is an approach from the cohort of several multivariate analysis methods and is widely used to model the dependence structure of two or more random variables de michele salvadori 2003 renard lang 2007 jongman et al 2014 relevant calculations and graphing are implemented in matlab 2 3 3 analysis of streamflow sediment load relationship the sediment rating curve which presents the relationship between streamflow and suspended sediment concentration by linear power and polynomial functions has been widely applied in previous studies sheridan et al 2011 gao et al 2017 the most common expression of the sediment rating curve is a power function syvitski et al 2000 sheridan et al 2011 here the relationship between streamflow q and sediment load s was described as a power function 1 s aq b where a and b are regression coefficients the rating coefficient a generally represents soil erodibility and sediment source availability and a high a value indicates intensively weathered materials that can be easily eroded the coefficient b has been generally assumed to represent erosive power and a high b value indicates that a slight increase in discharge can result in a strong increase in sediment transport we established the streamflow sediment load relationships under extreme conditions where extreme streamflow or sediment load occurred and under non extreme conditions therefore the sensitivity of qe and se to soil erodibility and river flow erosivity can be tested by the coefficients of the sediment rating curve 3 results 3 1 trends of extreme streamflow and sediment load the average annual qe during the period 1956 2019 increased from the upstream 31 6 108 m3 to the midstream 53 0 108 m3 and downstream 51 4 108 m3 of the yrb which were calculated by averaging the annual qe and se values of gauging stations in each sub basin table 1 the average annual se first increased from the upstream 20 7 mt to the midstream 369 6 mt and then decreased to the downstream 225 6 mt in addition the contribution of annual qe to the annual total streamflow increased from the upstream 13 5 to the midstream 15 5 and downstream 18 8 while the contribution of annual se to the annual total sediment load was 41 6 45 4 and 37 7 in the upstream midstream and downstream respectively which was much higher than that of qe the trends of annual qe and se exhibited pronounced spatiotemporal variations fig 3 and table 2 from 1956 to 2019 the qe and se significantly reduced p 0 001 in the upper middle and lower reaches but the decreases in qe and se in the source area were not significant in contrast to the decreasing trend during the whole study period the qe at the upstream stations during the p1 period 1956 1979 tended to increase p 0 01 and qe at all stations during the p3 period 2000 2019 increased significantly p 0 01 the se during the p1 and p2 1980 1999 periods showed variable trends decreasing or increasing at different stations while the interannual variation of se gradually stabilized at most stations and even slightly increased at the toudaoguai station since 2000 in addition the contribution of qe to annual streamflow gradually decreased at all stations except the lijin station where the contribution increased significantly p 0 05 table 2 the contribution of se to annual sediment load at the stations above the huayuankou station showed an insignificant decreasing trend while the contribution at the huayuankou and lijin stations increased significantly p 0 05 the relationships of qe or se between adjacent stations are shown in fig 4 overall the linear relationship of qe or se between adjacent stations is significant p 0 05 with r 2 0 69 which indicates good transferability of the extreme streamflow or sediment load between adjacent stations only the relationship of the se between the lanzhou and tangnaihai stations is not so good r 2 0 44 p 0 05 in addition by comparing the slope of the linear relationships the differences of both qe and se between the tongguan and toudaoguai stations are most significant among the adjacent stations as the tributaries from the loess plateau contributed huge amounts of streamflow and sediment table s1 3 2 synchronicity of extreme streamflow and sediment load the intra annual distribution of qe and se dates from 1956 to 2019 tends to disperse from the flood season july to september to the four seasons fig 5 and figure s1 the qe dates at the tangnaihai and lanzhou stations of the upper reaches concentrated in july september during the p1 period while those tended to occur in june october during the p2 and p3 periods the distribution of qe dates along the yr mainstream from toudaoguai to lijin is similar during the p1 and p2 periods i e the dates during p1 are concentrated in august september while those during p2 in the flood season especially august with a small distribution in march the qe dates during the p3 period are more dispersed such as a qe distribution from march october at the huayuankou station the se dates during p1 and p2 are mainly in the flood season mostly july and august except at the toudaoguai station where approximately 16 9 of se occurred in march during the p2 period during p3 the se dates at the tangnaihai and lanzhou stations are still in the flood season while those at the stations below the lanzhou station partially occurred in spring march and april especially for the toudaoguai station furthermore comparing the timing of qe and se the proportion of their monthly distribution is not exactly consistent especially at the lanzhou station fig 5 the synchronization probability of qe and se occurring on the same day of a year decreased from p1 to p2 in the upstream while that in the middle and lower reaches increased fig 6 from p2 to p3 the synchronization probability increased at the lanzhou and toudaoguai stations while that in the river source area and mid lower reaches decreased specifically the synchronization probability from p1 to p2 and p3 decreased at the tangnaihai and lanzhou stations changed insignificantly at the toudaoguai station and peaked during p2 in the mainstream below the toudaoguai station spatially the synchronization probability of 1 8 at the lanzhou station in periods p2 and p3 was the lowest and the synchronization probability increased from the middle reaches to the lower reaches 3 3 water sediment relationships under extreme and non extreme conditions there are pronounced differences and spatiotemporal variability in the coefficients a and b of the sediment rating curves under extreme and non extreme conditions across the yrb table 3 and table s3 relative to the non extremes the rating coefficient a in the water sediment relationship under extreme conditions distinctly increased whereas the rating coefficient b and the fitting r 2 decreased markedly table 3 indicating larger soil erodibility and sediment source availability reduced variability in erosive power and thus unstable water sediment relationships these also demonstrate the existence of a threshold such as the flow below some value in stable water sediment relationships the changes of the rating coefficients a and b during the three stages were similar for extreme and non extreme conditions only at the tangnainai and toudaoguai stations the rating coefficient a decreased from p1 to p2 and increased from p2 to p3 at the tangnaihai station but the coefficient b changed in opposite directions while these changes at the toudaoguai were the opposite to those at the tangnaihai station under extreme conditions the changes in the rating coefficients a and b at the huayuankou station were the same as those at the toudaoguai station the rating coefficient a at the lanzhou and tongguan stations gradually increased from p1 to p2 then to p3 and the rating coefficient b decreased and these changes at the lijin station were the opposite as a representative station of the main sediment source the variation of the rating coefficients a and b at the tongguan station indicated that soil erodibility and sediment source availability in the middle reaches gradually increased and erosive power variability gradually decreased from p1 to p2 then to p3 nevertheless the erosive power variability increased in the lower reaches lijin station and the soil erodibility and sediment source availability decreased due to the regulation of the xiaolangdi dam 4 discussion 4 1 impact of climate change on variations of streamflow and sediment load extremes extreme precipitation and the resulting floods landslides and gully erosion are important drivers and material sources of extreme water and sediment discharge into the river li et al 2020 this can be reflected by the recent extreme rainfall triggered flood and high magnitude sediment events in the middle yellow river in 2017 gao et al 2018 the important role of extreme precipitation in driving streamflow and sediment load extremes can also be statistically confirmed by the good correlations r 2 0 5 between the monthly maximum daily streamflow at the tangnaihai station during p1 p2 and p3 and the monthly maximum daily sediment load at the tangnaihai station during p1 with the cumulative 10 day precipitation before the dates of these monthly maximums table 4 these good power function correlation relationships with precipitation are also associated with minimal anthropogenic disturbances in the yellow river source area li et al 2021 ran et al 2020 also reported that flood occurrence usually coincides with extreme precipitation events and extreme sediment events are more closely related to precipitation than to water discharge in the middle reaches i e the loess plateau besides despite the overall trend of increasing precipitation from 1956 to 2019 table s4 the qe and se have significantly decreased p 0 05 table 2 indicating a gradual decreasing flood risk furthermore the extreme precipitation was distinctly greater at all stations during p3 than during p2 fig 7 while the qe and se reduced greatly from p2 to p3 fig 3 nevertheless although the flood risk in the yrb has become much lower in the last two decades than in the 1950 s the recently increasing frequency and magnitude of the heavy rainstorm fig s2 and extreme streamflow suggest that it remains a nonnegligible risk 4 2 impact of human activities on variations of streamflow and sediment load extremes human activities are the dominant factors in decreasing the annual streamflow and sediment load in the yellow river by intercepting water and sediment mainly through mainstream dam construction intra basin engineering construction reservoirs terraces and check dams and vegetation restoration measures grass plantation and afforestation rustomji et al 2008 lu et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 song et al 2020 hammond et al 2021 it is reasonable to infer that these human activities have also reduced the annual qe and se on a daily scale ran et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 xu et al 2021 however different human activities such as mainstream dam construction and intra basin soil conservation measures may have changed the qe and se in different ways on the one hand mainstream dam construction has different impacts on the variations of qe and se firstly there are different influences of a dam with different functions and roles on the resilience of qe and se and their relationships at the station below the dam fig 8 such as the longyangxia dam above lanzhou completed in 1989 chang et al 2022 and the xiaolangdi dam above huayuankou completed in 1999 kong et al 2015 the qe transport ratio between lanzhou and tangnaihai decreased after 1989 and did not recover afterward and the se transport ratio increased after 1989 and decreased after 1999 to the pre dam level fig 8 while the changes at the huayuankou station were just the opposite in addition the suspended sediment concentration also substantially shifted from the pre dam to the post dam period with an increase of 76 at the lanzhou station and a decrease of 80 3 at the huayuankou station fig 8 which can be attributed to the unique operation of xiaolangdi reservoir in the water and sediment regulation period kong et al 2022 secondly the water sediment regulation by reservoirs and dams can artificially change the synchronization of qe and se from the pre dam to the post dam period the timing of qe and se at the lanzhou and huayuankou stations changed to be generally dispersed fig s3 besides the synchronization probability of qe and se at the two stations lowered fig 9 due to the time staggered water and sediment regulation by dams according to different functional requirements such as power generation flood control silt reduction and agricultural irrigation therefore water sediment regulation by operating mainstream dams and reservoirs can lower high peaks raise low troughs as needed and change the patterns of streamflow and sediment load kong et al 2022 on the other hand intra basin reservoirs construction and soil conservation measures including afforestation grass plantation construction of terraces on hillslopes and construction of check dams on river channels can lead to gradual decreases in qe and se in a power function form these intra basin engineering and vegetation construction reduced runoff yield and soil erosion from precipitation and retained streamflow and sediment within the catchment wang et al 2016 fu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 spatially the maximum increment of se mainly occurred in the toudaoguai tongguan reach in the loess plateau the primary sediment yielding region table 1 therefore several good quantitative power function relationships between qe and se with the proportional area of these measures and cumulative reservoir capacity in the toudaoguai tongguan reach were established fig 10 with the increasing proportional area of various soil conservation measures e g check dams terraces grass plantation and afforestation and reservoir capacity the qe or se dropped to a quasi equilibrium state as a power function r 2 0 78 however under the same increase of proportional area the check dams and grass plantation resulted in a higher decrease in qe and se than terraces fig 10a and 10e and afforestation fig 10b and 10f respectively overall engineering measures resulted in a higher decrease in qe and se than vegetation restoration measures fig 10c and 10g additionally there may be divergent trends between qe and se over the same period due to different roles of dam construction engineering construction and vegetation restoration measures for example qe decreased but se increased during the period p2 at the lanzhou and tongguan stations fig 3 as mentioned above the construction of dams reservoirs and terraces directly retained sediment and drastically reduced se from p1 to p2 yet their sediment reduction efficiency would decrease year by year with the decreasing storage capacity and some retained sediment would be exported into downstream wang et al 2016 leading to a slow increase in se during p2 in contrast the impacts of check dams terraces and vegetation cover changes on fluvial streamflow is mostly a continuous and gradual process of reduction bao et al 2019 wang et al 2019 which will hinder the yield of runoff peak leading to a gradual decrease in se 4 3 implications for basin management the world s large river basins are often paramount homes for humans due to the demand for water and natural resources allan castillo 2007 de jalón et al 2017 however people living along rivers usually suffer the risk of flooding jongman et al 2014 humans thus commonly use hydraulic engineering soil conservation measures and vegetation restoration measures syvitski et al 2005 cohen et al 2014 to transform and manage watersheds to eliminate river risk and maximize water and sediment resources however the single implementation of these engineering measures cannot fully achieve these goals for example the large scale dam construction on the mainstream yr can substantially regulate the flow and suspended sediment concentration but also result in downstream riverbed incision due to the hungry water effect kondolf 1997 hu et al 2022 thus lowering low flow water levels and raising difficulties in water extraction for rivers below dams kong et al 2015 besides because of the dam s sediment retention effect deltas have further suffered from an increased risk of retreat and coastal erosion in addition the engineering measures can directly retain water and sediment but they play a relatively small part in decreasing the non extreme streamflow or sediment load for example there was a sudden reduction in se after 1980 at the tongguan station fig s4 but no sudden decrease in annual sediment load yin et al 2021 notably the se at the tongguan station increased slowly during 1980 1999 fig 3 probably due to the decreasing storage capacity of check dams wang et al 2016 accordingly the water and sediment reduction effect of soil conservation measures after 2000 was weaker than the water and sediment increase effect of markedly increasing extreme precipitation fig 7 leading to the trend of increasing qe and gradually stable se during 2000 2019 fig 3 streamflow is a major source of human water consumption which can reduce streamflow directly wang et al 2019 found that human water consumption contributed more than 90 to annual streamflow reduction between the 1950s and the 1980s in the yr which is consistent with our results of a sharp decrease in extreme hydrological values at most stations fig 3 thus human water extraction is also a non negligible factor in changing the qe and se song et al 2020 for example the qe and se in the lower reaches especially at the lijin station decreased significantly p 0 05 but the contribution of the extremes to the annual fluxes tended to increase from p1 to p3 this was due largely to the limitation of water extraction technology such as the limited water pumping power resulting in a smaller water diversion ratio in extreme cases than that in non extreme cases assuming that the daily water and sediment diversions are kept constant as a result water extraction activities have a much smaller impact on the water sediment extremes than non extremes these results provide insights into how to separately or jointly adopt soil conservation measures vegetation restoration measures and mainstream dam operations in the whole basin to improve the existing watershed management measures and achieve sustainable water utilization 5 conclusions this study innovatively investigated the long term changes in magnitudes relationships and synchronicity of extreme streamflow and sediment load from the basin wide perspective and filled the knowledge gap in the quantitative influences of major human activities on extreme streamflow and sediment load changes we found that extreme streamflow and sediment load have decreased significantly since the 1950 s except for the insignificant decrease in the yellow river source region however the extreme streamflow increased significantly during 2000 2019 while the extreme sediment load tended to stabilize at most stations furthermore the occurrence dates of extreme streamflow and sediment load tended to disperse from the flood season to the four seasons of a year there is strong evidence that the fundamental drivers of extreme water and sediment discharges are extreme precipitation events nevertheless the magnitude and hazard characteristics of streamflow and sediment load extremes can be strongly regulated by anthropogenic activities we highlight that mainstream dam operations can artificially change and control the streamflow and sediment load extremes water sediment relationships and extreme water sediment synchronization while intra basin anthropogenic engineering and vegetation measures can decrease the peak flood to get more detailed mechanisms of anthropogenic activities and climate change in influencing extreme streamflow and sediment load we will consider using hydrological models for further research in the future credit authorship contribution statement shihua yin data curation formal analysis writing original draft guangyao gao conceptualization

2172,it is widely known that flow in fractured sedimentary rock is dominated by the interconnected fractures in the rock mass but it is difficult to determine which fractures observed in boreholes are active meaning they transmit water under natural gradient conditions a methodology is presented that uses optical televiewer otv and continuous core logs synergistically with flute transmissivity t profiling straddle packer testing rock core permeability testing active line source temperature logs and rock core voc concentration profiles to determine the number and position of active fractures in a 196 meter borehole in sandstone the application of this methodology indicates that 40 of the identified fractures are active in this borehole with a frequency of 0 61 active fractures per meter which compares well with the number of fractures identified with the straddle packer rec method used in the largest transmissive zones while the low transmissivity zones tested are consistent with laboratory measured rock matrix hydraulic conductivity high resolution hydraulically based methods provide the necessary evidence to improve estimates of active fractures that control solute transport this paper demonstrates how multiple spatially resolved data sets can be used synergistically to inform fracture network parameters thereby constraining hydraulic aperture and surface area calculations that control flow and diffusion with the aim of improving the estimation of plume migration rates and mass discharge to receptors in fractured sedimentary rocks keywords hydraulically active fractures fractured sedimentary rocks straddle packer testing temperature logging rock core voc profiles core log data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction bedrock aquifers are some of the most prolific sources of high quality groundwater including all types of sedimentary igneous and metamorphic rocks and it is the fractures that dominate bedrock bulk hydraulic conductivity in these systems despite the fracture void volume being extremely small typically between 1 10 2 to 1 10 5 freeze and cherry 1979 therefore characterizing the fracture network is essential for estimating groundwater travel times i e velocities or residence times to evaluate the vulnerability of an aquifer to contaminants effective fracture porosity is often determined from estimates of hydraulic apertures within a subsurface volume but reliable estimates are confounded by the difficulty of determining the active fracture distribution from field data the importance of identifying active fractures and quantifying flow in fractured rock systems has motivated the oil and gas industry to develop new and improved methods to increase yield but the conditions and challenges required in freshwater hydrogeology require higher resolution measurements for contaminant transport arrival time and mass discharge predictions and site remediation given the need for improved hydrogeologic conceptual site models the scientific community has pursued new methods for identifying and quantifying fracture activity connectivity over the past 20 years flowmeter logging has become a standard tool for identifying the location of active features in boreholes keys sullivan 1979 ren et al 2018 the conventional impellor flowmeter tool has evolved into the development of heat pulse hess 1986 and electromagnetic molz et al 1994 flowmeter logging techniques that allow for the measurement of flow rates at much lower velocities with and without pumping thereby improving flow estimates paillet 1998 2000 williams paillet 2002 temperature and or fluid conductivity profiling in an open borehole can also identify flowing fractures using highly sensitive sensors to identify small temperature or electrical conductivity variations within the water column caused by the depth discrete inflow of water drury 1984 williams conger 1990 klepikova et al 2011 suski et al 2008 tsang et al 1989 introduced a method using conductivity logs taken in a borehole after replacing the borehole fluid with either deionized or saline water relatively conductive formation water entering the borehole appears as a peak or trough in the fluid conductivity profile that can be compared to geophysical image logs to identify the position of flowing i e active fractures however the information gained from these logging tools is limited because data is collected under open borehole conditions where the highest transmissive fractures intersecting the borehole will dominate the flow in out of the borehole because of the cross connection of fractures with differing head wilson et al 2001 pehme et al 2007 quinn et al 2016 even when best practices are employed these methods are relatively insensitive to intermediate and smaller active fractures e g nas 2020 parker et al 2018 rushton howard 1982 and therefore open hole testing is biased to identify only the highest transmissive fractures during logging work has also been done to detect and characterize active fractures through cross hole testing of multiple boreholes paillet et al 1987 le borgne et al 2006 illman 2014 but these are extensions of the above methods with similar biases and are often performed to obtain bulk values for hydraulic conductivity i e discerning more than the most transmissive fractures contributing to flow remains difficult additional efforts to improve detection limits for flow include the incorporation of flow diverters with heat pulse flowmeters to limit vertical flow within a discrete zone so that horizontal flow data can be collected however these results are often impacted in boreholes with large vertical flow pehme et al 2007 flexible liners have been used to temporarily seal boreholes to remove the influence of the open hole on fluid flow and hydraulic head distributions cherry et al 2007 pehme et al 2007 2011 2013 installed a flexible impermeable liner filled with water to create a temporary borehole seal thereby returning the system to ambient flow conditions before collecting temperature logs using an active heat source with continuous cable in the stagnant water column inside the liner the active line source als method involves heating the water in the sealed borehole and collecting a series of temperature profiles using a highly sensitive sensor 10 3 c resolution to detect cooling caused by flowing features intersecting the sealed borehole similarly active fibre optic distributed temperature sensing a dts has been deployed in boreholes using a flexible liner to seal the cable against the borehole wall to provide continuous temperature profiles over time in heated boreholes coleman et al 2015 bense et al 2016 maldaner et al 2019 munn et al 2020 these temperature methods in sealed boreholes offer enhanced temporal and spatial resolution when compared to conventional open hole trolling based techniques allowing for improved identification of hydraulically active fractures hydrologic characterization of fractured rock often relies on straddle packer tests to determine transmissivity t in depth discrete intervals but estimates of hydraulic apertures are plagued by the uncertainty in the number of fractures contributing to flow in the test interval e g maini 1971 magnusson duran 1984 lapcevic 1988 andersson et al 1988 quinn et al 2011b some researchers have focussed testing on individual fractures e g novakowski et al 1985 novakowski 1988 novakowski et al 2006 but in most cases it is impractical to test all fractures individually in long boreholes quinn et al 2011a b proposed a methodology to use the hydraulic behavior of the tested zone i e the onset of nonlinear flow to determine the effective number of fractures participating in the response in support of this approach quinn et al 2020 conducted an in depth review of published laboratory studies on flow through single rock fractures with known conditions and for those few studies which measured linear data and physically measured the fracture aperture empirically derived a logarithmic relationship between the critical reynolds number and the measured fracture aperture the visual inspection of rock core allows for the identification of fracture surface characteristics that are related to signs of fluid movement physical or chemical weathering mineral precipitates oxidation staining striations etc that can be used to infer the distribution of active fractures in a properly cored hole e g magnusson duran 1984 west and kueper 2004 west et al 2005 however the usefulness of this method is extremely dependent on the quality of the rock core as well as the experience and consistency of the individual s logging it is also difficult to conclude if evidence for flow observed in the core reflects current flow conditions or if the flow conditions have changed over the lifespan of the fracture this is especially true in areas of frequent tectonic activity as is the case for this and many study sites it is also possible for an active fracture to have no visual evidence of flow these uncertainties indicate that the quality and or usefulness of a core log can vary to a much greater extent than other more quantitative data collected e g sampling and analysis head profiles etc all these methods for identifying active fractures have limitations that can only be reconciled using multiple data sets to remove the inherent bias or limits of detection for each method this study promotes the use of new and traditional high resolution borehole datasets that are used synergistically as a more robust decision framework to enumerate hydraulically active fractures it presents a multiple lines of evidence approach using a subset of new and conventional high resolution borehole characterization methods presented within the discrete fracture network matrix field approach described by parker et al 2012 this use of complementary methods provides insights into the strength and limitations of various techniques for active fracture identification ultimately improving confidence in the selection data was collected at an industrial site used for field research with trichloroethylene tce contamination that occurred decades ago but where much effort has been applied to use multiple field methods at a higher resolution than is typical for standard practice as part of scientific inquiry this field based research is aimed at improving our understanding of individual processes affecting plume behaviour in fractured sedimentary rocks through better characterization of the fracture network affecting both flow and transport fracture aperture and frequency are linked parameters and influence the advection diffusion interactions and plume characteristics over time affecting rates of plume front migration internal plume concentration distributions and remediation process understanding leads to improved parameter inputs for numerical models that support decision making 2 study site description and hydrogeology this study was conducted at the santa susana field laboratory ssfl located approximately 65 km northwest of downtown los angeles in southern california fig 1 a where tce was first discovered in groundwater at the site in 1984 investigations to characterize groundwater contamination motivated by environmental regulations continued from 1985 to the present using novel high resolution field methods as part of a field based research program parker et al 2011 2012 ssfl is bounded to the north by the simi valley to the west by the san fernando valley and to the south by the santa monica mountains the study site overlies the late cretaceous chatsworth formation a deep sea turbidite deposit that consists primarily of sandstones interbedded with lesser amounts of shale and siltstone link et al 1984 mwh 2004 cilona et al 2016 did extensive fracture mapping of the exposed bedrock fig 1b over the scale of the site 2850 acres 5 5 by 2 5 km distances the study corehole c 10 intersects the canyon member in what is informally referred to as the upper chatsworth formation montgomery watson 2000 the lithology of this unit is almost exclusively comprised of coarse medium and fine grained sandstones 96 with occasional fine grained silt and shale beds 4 individual fine grained beds are generally less than 1 m thick and typically less than 0 3 m thick sandstone beds between the fine grained members may be laterally extensive and are typically more than 3 m thick mwh 2009 coarse grained sandstone members with few or no fine grained interbeds commonly show turbidite deposit characteristics cilona et al 2016 c 10 was completed very near a known source of tce contamination within 200 ft as a vertical telescoping core hole with an 8 inch diameter surface casing drilled from 0 to 15 2 m below ground surface bgs a drilled 5 inch diameter borehole from 15 2 to 30 3 m bgs and a 4 inch diameter cored hole to the completion depth of 196 m bgs 166 m cored hole the top of bedrock is approximately 2 7 m bgs and the open hole water level varies between 26 7 and 27 3 m bgs the lithology observed in the extracted core is predominantly sandstone with interbedded siltstone sandstone and shale present sporadically throughout the hole this core hole intersected a small fault feature at 103 m bgs and a major fault known as the shear zone dipping 75 nnw near the bottom of the hole at approximately 190 5 m bgs both of which were identified by an abundance of fault gouge the coring stopped shortly after detecting the shear zone to avoid piercing through the fault the shear zone has been shown to be a barrier to both groundwater flow and contaminant migration based on groundwater monitoring groundwater level differences and pumping tests cilona et al 2016 for example c10 is located on the se side of the fault where the depth to water dtw is typically 30 m bgs while in c11 on the nw side of the shear zone the dtw is over 60 m bgs a twelve port flute multilevel system installed in this hole indicates that the vertical gradient in c10 is 2 8 m over 180 m of the borehole length comprised of smaller upward and downward gradients throughout the hole 3 approach and methods the intensive site characterization work that occurred in the study borehole using novel borehole techniques provides a unique opportunity to use multiple high quality data sets synergistically to assess the potential for specific fractures to be hydraulically active continuous coring allowed for detailed logging at the cm scale for matrix and fracture characteristics as well as lithology rock core voc sampling near and away from fractures and rock core testing for matrix physical properties including porosity wet and dry bulk densities and permeability otv video and natural gamma geophysical logs were collected following the coring and development of the hole finally data from unique hydraulic methods including als temperature logging e g pehme et al 2013 and selective high resolution straddle packer testing at 1 5 m long depth discrete intervals over 73 of the saturated borehole length guided by a flute liner transmissivity profile quinn et al 2015 keller et al 2013 3 1 continuous core and geophysical logs informing fractures the first step in the identification of active fractures involves the correlation of the core descriptions with the otv log both logs contain information about lithology and fractures and therefore both lithology and fractures are used to correlate the logs these logs are collected independently and have different inherent errors and uncertainties which are minimized when the logs are correlated visual inspection and logging of the core at the cm scale provides information about the lithology as well as fracture depths dip angles and physical description of the fractures and or the rock matrix and the core was photographed at the end of each core run fracture descriptions include evidence of flow such as oxidation staining mineral precipitation silt or sand deposits weathering of the fracture surface striations bedding plane features or evidence of lack of flow such as clay infilling or complete mineralization i e healed fracture some of the core descriptions are very specific while others are more generic for example many fractures were described as having some or trace silt on the fracture surface whereas fewer fractures were described as having a measurable thickness of silt on the surface i e 1 mm or 2 5 mm thick the same holds true for oxidation staining which varied from trace staining on the fracture surface to oxidation staining extending 5 60 mm into the matrix from the fracture both the signs of flow and the degree magnitude of these descriptions were assessed to identify the most consistent signs of flow from the core description that is supported by other hydraulic based methods used in this study the main errors that typically arise in core logs are related to poor rock quality i e broken zones and incomplete core recovery both of which can result in unidentified features and cause errors in recovered core depths drilling induced fractures mechanical breaks are also a source of error as their identification is subjective and relies heavily upon the experience of the individual logging the core for this reason all mechanical breaks identified in the core log for this study are retained and assessed through comparison to the otv log the otv log provides a continuous image of the borehole wall from which the depth dip and strike of all features can be determined as well as the location of fine grained units dip and orientation data were used to identify the dominant fracture sets and determine the average dip and direction of the bedding each fracture identified in the otv log was classified as either open there is a measurable aperture at the borehole wall complete can easily see the entire fracture trace or incomplete cannot see the entire fracture trace otv logs are limited by their image resolution and can be impacted by run speed and poor water clarity however the quality of the otv log collected in this study was considered excellent due to the clarity of the borehole water efforts were made to achieve the highest quality log possible by allowing sufficient time after hole development for suspended particles to settle before beginning the correlation of the core and otv logs care was taken to ensure that the geophysical logs were properly referenced to the ground surface to match the reference of the core log the otv log is considered the best estimate of the depths of the lithology and fractures because it is a continuous wireline log using an encoder to monitor depth during logging and the depths compared well with the video log that was collected the gamma log was compared against the otv log using gamma spikes an indication of clay or shale to confirm the depths of the siltstone and shale units that were readily observable in the otv the core log was examined in detail together with core photos fig 1c and the rock core voc sampling logs to identify any errors in recovery length lithology depth or thickness fracture depths and to identify features that were missed in the logging process because the depth errors in the core log are not uniform throughout the hole fracture and lithology information from only the recovered sections of each core run were used to represent each run in many cases the recovery recorded in the core log did not match the recovery documented in the core photo in these instances the photo was considered the most accurate in many runs the core photo clearly showed that the recovery was greater than 5 ft 1 5 m which is reasonable up to a maximum of 4 in 0 1 m which is the extra space between the core catcher and the core bit i e core shoe the extra recovered length was always considered to impact the true starting depth of the next run and the starting depths were adjusted accordingly runs longer than 5 ft cause the recovered run depths to slightly increase while lost recovery results in gaps between the runs allowing for adjustments of the run depths during correlation without disturbing the runs above or below care was taken to ensure that no runs overlapped during this procedure if a run was shifted down to match the otv and there was no space below for the shift all runs below had to shift to prevent overlap until the shift eventually became accommodated by recovery loss these are common challenges with core logs thereby rendering a borehole image log invaluable for validating and improving the information from core logs clay rich units had a strong colour contrast from the surrounding sandstone and were therefore easily identified in both the otv and the core these lithologies were used for the primary correlation because they are quickly and easily distinguished in both the core and otv log once the core lithology was shifted to match the otv log the fractures and voc samples in each respective run were shifted an equal amount then each fracture in the aligned core log was correlated to the fractures present in the otv log by comparing the angle recorded in the core log to the dip measured in the otv often the depths between the correlated fractures were not exact i e 10 cm due to the errors inherent in the coring process i e core retrieval recovery loss rock pulverization imprecise measurement etc mechanical breaks were also evaluated through a comparison to otv at this time fractures originally recorded as mechanical breaks that had no counterpart in the otv log were considered true mechanical breaks but if a corresponding otv fracture was observed the mechanical break was re classified as a natural feature in instances where fractures were observed in otv but not in the corresponding core run the core photos typically showed that the fractures were indiscernible in the extracted core because of poor rock quality i e heavily fractured zones where it was not possible to distinguish between individual fractures once individual fractures are correlated the visual descriptions of fractures in the core log are used to inform the corresponding fractures in the otv log to produce what is here on referred to as the core informed otv log an example of the correlation process using lithology identifying a mechanical break and transferring core descriptions to the otv log is illustrated in fig 2 it should be noted that during core logging when the hole was tagged throughout the coring process usually at the beginning or end of the day the tag depth was recorded and the core logger used that depth as the current depth regardless of the depth of the previous run if the tag depth was less than the previous run the core log indicated an overlap and when it was deeper it showed a space between runs in this study the correlation of the core log to the otv log proved to be an excellent method to assess the accuracy of depths tagged during drilling 3 2 high resolution methods for identifying hydraulic activity a mixture of standard and newer innovative methods were used synergistically with the core informed otv log to identify the hydraulically active fractures these include high resolution selective straddle packer testing e g quinn et al 2015 standard laboratory matrix permeability testing on rock core als temperature logging in a lined borehole pehme et al 2010 and 2014 and standard rock core voc analyses e g sterling et al 2005 parker et al 2012 parker et al 2018 3 2 1 straddle packer testing and matrix physical properties testing selective straddle packer testing using a 1 5 m test interval was conducted over 73 of the saturated length of the borehole with transducers monitoring above and below the tested interval seventeen constant head step tests were conducted in the most permeable zones while 54 pneumatic slug tests were conducted in the remaining zones the flute t profile keller et al 2013 was used as a guide for selective packer testing but was also used to assess the correction for short circuiting to the open hole identified from transducer monitoring above and below the test interval during the straddle packer tests by comparing the t values of the entire hole quinn et al 2016 these hydraulic datasets were also combined to provide an improved t profile of the borehole quinn et al 2015 this t profile was subsequently used to assess the potential for permeable fractures in each tested zone in many of the zones where pneumatic slug tests were initiated the air in the riser pipe was pressurized and the interval pressure increased and remained constant for at least 5 min or recovered very slightly i e 1 cm over a 15 minute time span indicating that no water or very little water was displaced from the test zone these zones were assigned a t value of 5 10 8 m2 s based on what is considered the lower limit of the testing equipment which is equivalent to a flow rate of 5 ml min i e solving the thiem equation for flow using 1 m of applied head an analysis of the otv and core fracture data showed that in many cases there were no observable fractures in these zones indicating that a lack of hydraulic response is likely an indication that there are no hydraulically active fractures this was further supported by lab permeability tests conducted on 18 samples collected in four cored holes through the same lithostratigraphic unit within 61 m of the study borehole 3 2 2 als temperature logging in sealed boreholes the active line source temperature logging data in a lined borehole was collected and processed as described in pehme et al 2013 to generate thermal deviation logs where each aberration in the thermal deviation log represents a change in temperature that suggests a fracture with active flow in this methodology a cable was lowered into the lined hole to heat the static water column in the liner resulting in raising the temperature of the water in the lined hole by an average of 0 79 c then a high resolution temperature probe with a resolution of 10 4 c was used to measure temperature variability with depth at 1 h and 4 h after heating was stopped the signals from the thermal deviation logs were placed into five categories based on the relative magnitude of the temperature change very low low moderate high and very high the als temperature logging method is considered a qualitative log that identifies very small temperature deviations that have been shown to correspond to active flow pehme et al 2007 2013 but may not always be indicators of hydraulically significant fractures because it does not distinguish between fracture or matrix flow to quantify the magnitude of cooling that constitutes matrix flow the als signals were assessed at depths that contained no visible fractures in the core or otv logs and within the straddle packer intervals that showed no hydraulic response to determine the maximum amount of cooling that would constitute evidence for matrix flow 3 2 3 rock core voc concentration profiles the rock core was sampled for voc analysis sterling et al 2005 parker et al 2012 parker et al 2018 at an average frequency of 2 5 samples per meter throughout the cored hole each rock sample was crushed and transferred to 125 ml wide mouth voa jars with teflon screw caps containing 60 ml of hplc grade methanol weighed before and after the sample was added to determine a wet weight of crushed rock typically 100 g a five week extraction period using the shake flask technique at 4 c was performed to ensure complete extraction of the analytes from the rock into the methanol analysis of the chlorinated ethenes in the methanol was done using the analytical procedure described by gorecka et al 2001 where aliquots of the methanol were injected directly into a gas chromatograph for separation and quantification using a micro electron capture detector the total voc concentrations include contributions from sorbed dissolved and any immiscible phase dnapl when present the study focuses on tce because it was consistently detected throughout the borehole and was detected at the highest concentrations making it the best candidate as the contaminant tracer 3 3 workflow for selecting active fractures the workflow for selecting active fractures is outlined in fig 3 the first step for selecting active fractures was correlating the otv and natural gamma logs to the core log data this was followed by a direct comparison of fractures identified in the core informed otv log with the packer testing derived transmissivities the als thermal deviation log and voc concentration profiles all features were individually assessed against all available flow evidence to identify the most likely hydraulically active fractures the greater the number of flow indicators from the different datasets that aligned with each fracture the greater the confidence in the fracture being active the likelihood of a fracture being active was determined by counting the number of independent forms of evidence visual evidence from core als signals voc detections and transmissivity above the average lab matrix values that aligned with specific features in contrast fractures in packer zones with no measurable transmissivity were considered not active or connected given the method resolution was similar to the mean matrix hydraulic conductivity the indicators of flow were also used to evaluate the strength of the visual flow signs recorded in the core log before these signs were used to help determine the active fractures it is important to note that it is difficult to assign an instance of flow evidence from als voc or packer t to an individual fracture when features are intersecting because it is impossible to determine which of the intersecting fractures is contributing to the observed sign of flow in this study the decision was made to assign the evidence to all intersecting fractures when this was the case this could result in a slight overestimation of the true number of active fractures within the borehole and must be considered when assessing the results 3 4 critical reynolds number analysis a relatively new method using the onset of non darcian flow in a constant head step test e g quinn et al 2011b was used to estimate the number of hydraulically active fractures in the most permeable zones using the logarithmic relationship between the critical reynolds number rec and the physically measured aperture 2b from laboratory tests on single fractures empirically determined by quinn et al 2020 this methodology assumes that the fractures participating in the hydraulic test follow the cubic law relatively well so only the results from the laboratory studies where the fractures were physically measured and linear data was collected were used in the determination of this relationship it is reasonable to assume that this relationship will apply to the hydraulic apertures calculated from the straddle packer tests the cubic law defines the hydraulic aperture 2bh as 2 2 b h 12 μ t ρ g 3 where μ is the water viscosity m lt ρ is the density of water m l3 g is the gravitational acceleration l t2 t is the transmissivity l2 t and n is the number of permeable fractures present it should be noted that there are two commonly used terms for the fracture aperture e and 2bh the 2bh term comes from the mathematics for flow through smooth parallel plates where symmetry is used to simplify the solution by solving for half the aperture b thereby making 2b the height of the entire aperture quinn et al 2020 used this form of the cubic law to determine the relationship between rec and the measured aperture for all of the laboratory tests presented in the literature that measured linear flow in the hydraulic test and physically measured the aperture however field researchers have historically assumed one fracture in each tested zone or modified the cubic law when more than one fracture was identified in a tested zone by dividing t by the number of fractures assuming that each fracture is the same size neither of these assumptions is ideal because the tools commonly used to identify fractures i e core log and image logs typically identify more than one fracture in each tested zone and rarely indicate that fractures are the same size snow 1970 addressed the assumption of same size fractures for calculating apertures and stated that the aperture calculated using this assumption is the same as the mean of the distribution apertures because there is no widely accepted methodology for dealing with multiple fractures in a straddle packer test intervals the rec method also assumes that all fractures detected are the same size the procedure begins by plotting rec calculated at the largest darcian flow rate versus 2bh for all zones where a constant head step test was conducted assuming a single active fracture in each tested zone this plot typically shows that in general rec increases as 2bh increases with considerable scatter the logarithmic relationship determined by quinn et al 2020 is plotted on the same graph as a guide for the field tests then the number of fractures for each tested zone is changed to match the relationship derived from the laboratory tests an improvement of the initial methodology published in 2011 is to use a fractional number of fractures for the field tests to account for the fact that rock fractures are not smooth parallel plates i e real fractures likely have more friction because of roughness and aperture variation and fractures in the same test zone typically have different apertures i e the measured data is a blending of all active fractures present however because most of the flow will be through the largest fractures they will dominate the response therefore a non integer number of fractures is sometimes slightly smaller than an integer likely due to more friction and sometimes slightly larger than an integer indicating the blending of the responses of multiple sized fractures the number of fractures identified in the otv and core logs are used to bound the upper limit of fractures available for flow in each packer test interval as well as identify zones with no fractures where only matrix flow is present in this study the rec method was applied to 17 test intervals each 1 5 m long where a constant head step test was conducted and at least one fracture was identified the major uncertainty in this method stems from the lack of laboratory studies focused on measuring the rec vs 2bh relationship in the quinn et al 2020 review as only eleven tests from five studies were rigorous enough to be used in determining the empirically derived logarithmic relationship resulting in a range of apertures between 100 and 500 µm this forced gradient method was only used in the largest t zones and likely represent only the largest fractures present in the tested zone that carry most of the flow in the hydraulic test the average percentage of the fractures identified in the otv log that the rec approach identifies as actively carrying flow is used to determine the number of fractures in all other zones where a t value was measured by slug tests then the number of fractures identified in all zones i e the 17 zones with ch step tests and all zones where t was obtained from slug tests are compared to the number of active fractures identified using multiple datasets 3 5 technique for estimating hydraulic apertures hydraulic apertures were calculated for all portions of the hole where depth discrete transmissivity value was obtained from either straddle packer testing or flute profiling using the number of active fractures determined from the multiple datasets when more than one fracture was present in a tested zone all active fractures within a packer interval are assumed to have the same aperture zones without any active fractures were supported by measured transmissivity values equal to 1 standard deviation of the mean matrix hydraulic conductivity determined from laboratory measurements using astm d4525 90 on 18 core samples 4 results and discussion 4 1 otv core correlation a total of 157 4 m of hq core was recovered from a 166 m continuously cored hole 94 5 overall recovery correlation of core logs to the otv logs based on the lithology and fractures showed that 62 of the core runs required some depth adjustment to align these features with the otv log with most adjustments in sections of the borehole where there was incomplete or poor recovery of the 138 core runs only seven had to be shifted more than 0 3 m for six of these runs the shift was 0 37 m and one run was shifted 0 60 m the 0 6 m shift was required in run 96 a 1 5 m run which only had 1 1 m recovery and the previous 1 5 m run 95 had 0 91 m recovery despite significant core loss in this portion of the borehole the shifting did not interfere with the nearby runs the correlation process also determined that there were errors in two reported tag depths deep in the hole at 171 0 m bgs and 178 6 m bgs in both instances the reported depth was 0 3 m shallower than the true depth a small difference not easy to identify over these long borehole lengths tag depth errors can occur because of the difficulty in lowering a tag line into deeper boreholes that are typically not truly vertical or rough vuggy borehole walls or voids that can easily snag the tagline visual inspection of the rock core in the field combined with a secondary analysis of the core photos identified a total of 281 features four features were classified as broken zones with no other visual description 195 were classified as fractures 70 64 as mechanical breaks 23 12 as healed 4 and 6 were incipient 1 during the correlation process 38 fractures identified in the core log were re classified to mechanical breaks because there was no associated fracture in the otv log and 9 mechanical breaks in the core were re classified to fractures because they aligned with fractures observed in the otv in one instance the otv misidentified a fracture that was observed in the core to be a thin dark lamination the four broken zones in the core log were associated with 6 fractures in the otv log but with no evidence of flow from the core log overall based on the correlation of the core and otv the number of open fractures identified in the core became 172 and the mechanical breaks were 93 the core informed otv identified 34 competent zones 97 m defined as continuous sections of rock of at least 1 5 m with no discernable fractures fig 4 the core informed otv log identified a total of 246 fractures with 74 otv fractures not observed in the core log where there was poor recovery and poor rock quality index values i e broken up correlating core fractures to the otv log was shown to be the most effective way of establishing the true distribution of natural fractures with accurate fracture depth orientation and physical descriptions of the correlated fractures 4 1 1 evidence for flow from core observations a total of 276 descriptions of fractures potentially associated with flow were recorded in the core log oxidation staining was present in 20 fractures with the degree of staining ranging from trace surface oxidation to diffusive staining penetrating 60 mm into the rock matrix however oxidation staining was not observed below a depth of 85 m bgs thereby eliminating the use of this indicator at greater depths pyrite calcite and gypsum mineralization was observed in 25 fractures at varying degrees ranging from trace surface mineralization to complete closure of the fracture healed all nine fractures described as healed in the core log were not considered hydraulically active weathering of the fracture surface was mostly described as slightly rough 102 while slightly rough to smooth fracture surfaces were the next most common observation 10 fractures that appeared rough were observed twice and 3 fractures that appeared fresh were associated with mechanical breaks silt deposits e g grey silt reddish brown clayey silt yellowish brown sandy silt were frequently observed and described qualitatively based on the colour and thickness of material deposited on the fracture surface however thick silt deposits were often quantified by a measurement ranging from 1 mm to 5 mm thick thirty eight fractures were described as having trace silt on the surface while seventy fractures were described as having silt of varying thickness on their surface fractures with evidence of fault activity contained gouge deposits up to 30 mm thick and were identified two times 4 2 evidence for active fractures from other borehole methods the core informed otv log was then compared to evidence of flow from other high resolution methods including rock core voc detections als and transmissivity values from straddle packer tests to determine the distribution of active fractures in the borehole 4 2 1 transmissivities from straddle packer hydraulic testing selective straddle packer testing was conducted in this hole using a flute transmissivity profile as a guide for identifying moderate to high t zones as outlined by quinn et al 2015 before correction for short circuiting to the open hole a comparison of the t of the entire hole from packer testing to the flute t profile showed that the flute t was 72 less than the packer testing t and after correction the flute t was 5 less indicating that the correction process was effective at removing the error due to short circuiting in addition the calculation of the blended head using the straddle packer head and t values resulted in a blended head that was approximately 5 in 13 cm shallower than the measured value constant head step tests were conducted in 17 intervals over 25 5 m of the hole and slug tests were conducted in 57 intervals over 85 5 m of the hole where straddle packer testing was not conducted the flute profile value provided t estimates twenty five slug test intervals 31 5 m of the borehole showed no hydraulic response less than5 0 10 8 m2 s from a pneumatic slug test and therefore the fractures observed in these zones were assumed to be very small or dead end fractures not connected to the larger fracture network these extensive low permeable zones act as a barrier to vertical flow in the formation near the studied hole fig 4 shows the distribution of transmissivity throughout the borehole obtained by slug tests constant head step tests and flute profiling for zones where a response was measured values range from a minimum of 6 9 10 8 m2 s and a maximum of 5 3 10 4 m2 s transmissivity is greatest in the bottom half of the borehole below 145 0 m bgs likely due to the borehole encountering the damage zone of the shear zone fault at 190 m bgs the number of core informed otv fractures was not always consistent with the measured t for example two intervals with high fracture intensities located at 85 0 and 177 0 m bgs with fracture counts of 11 and 12 respectively correlate with high t zones while the zone from 136 to 137 m bgs where 12 fractures were identified showed no hydraulic response this illustrates the difficulty of determining the hydraulic activity of fractures using borehole imaging without the support of hydraulic tests the matrix hydraulic conductivity from the core 18 sandstone samples taken from the canyon member of the upper chatsworth formation in four nearby cored holes ranged from 1 9 10 10 m s to 1 1 10 7 m s with an average of 2 2 10 8 m s and a geometric mean of 6 4 10 9 m s table 1 however only one permeability test was in the 10 7 m s range with all other tests measuring less than 10 7 m s average matrix permeability was converted to an equivalent matrix t by multiplying by 1 5 m the packer interval length 3 3 10 8 m2 s to facilitate the comparison to the packer derived t for assessing significant flow these data show that the estimated lower limit of the packer testing equipment 5 10 8 m s is similar to the equivalent mean matrix t obtained from laboratory tests on the rock core 3 3 10 8 m s and therefore is likely smaller than originally estimated based on this comparison it is reasonable to assume that all potentially active fractures can only exist in zones where there was a measurable hydraulic response overall 74 straddle packer tests were conducted and in all zones where the t value from the packer tests was greater than 1 0 10 5 m2 s 24 zones the largest matrix equivalent t 1 8 10 7 m s can be considered negligible when all t values are given to one decimal place the lower values of matrix permeability measured in the lab are most likely associated with the lower t zones and therefore would also be negligible if the field measured t was greater than 1 10 6 m2 s 16 zones when the packer tests measured t values were less than 1x10 6 but greater than 5x10 8 m2 s 13 zones the t value may have been influenced by the matrix permeability thereby overestimating the apertures in these zones if there were no active fractures selected it was assumed that flow was dominated by the matrix twenty one straddle packer zones 32 m showed no hydraulic response 5 10 8 m2 s these zones likely minimize vertical flow in the formation in this part of the flow system 4 2 2 active line source temperature profiles in flute lined boreholes evidence of cooling within the lined heated borehole appears as peaks in the thermal deviation log the amplitude of the peak referred to as the cooling signal is the observed change in water temperature at that depth and is related to the amount of flow carrying heat away at the borehole wall pehme et al 2013 a total of 798 cooling signals were identified with magnitudes ranging from 0 0057 to 0 0432 c the weakest very low low als signals show poor correlation to fractures in the informed otv log and were commonly observed in parts of the hole with no observable fractures e g between 150 m bgs to 153 m bgs this suggests that these low magnitude signals may not be associated with active fractures and instead likely result from flow through the porous matrix or are simply noise in the data these nonideal signals were assessed where fractures were not identified and in zones with no hydraulic response resulting in the minimum cooling signal associated with fracture flow of 0 0175 c fig 5 when the signals above this cooling threshold are used the correlation between the als signals and the informed otv fractures is significantly improved a total of 160 signals above the cooling threshold were detected over the 150 m of the hole that was analyzed 142 moderate flow signals 0 0175 c to 0 02 c 16 high signals 0 02 c to 0 03 c and 2 very high signals 0 03 c to 0 04 c in some cases the als signals were not aligned with fractures as shown in fig 5 and figure si 3d in the supporting information this signal drift was common where large transmissivity contrasts i e most often high t over low t were observed and is likely due to free convection occurring when more dense cooler water overlies less dense warmer water resulting in the vertical movement of water there were also instances where high angle fractures intersecting the borehole gave rise to two or more als responses along the length of the fracture in these cases the core informed otv allowed for the proper evaluation of these signals as evidence of a single active fracture 4 2 3 rock core voc concentrations near fractures a total of 408 rock core voc samples were analyzed covering 164 7 m of the hole voc sampling logs record the position of the samples relative to the observed fractures in the core the tce rock pore water concentrations ranged from non detects 9 10 5 μg g wet rock to a maximum of 2 3 μg g fig 4 tce was detected and quantified in 178 samples tce was detected but was not quantifiable in 187 samples and tce was not detected in 43 samples method detection and reporting limits vary slightly for each sample due to slight variability in wet rock sample mass per unit volume of methanol used for preservation and extraction in each vial in fig 4 samples with concentrations below the method detection limit mdl are shown as crosses and values above the method reporting limit mrl are plotted as solid circles non quantifiable data points are plotted as open circles tce was detected from the top of the water table to the bottom of the borehole and is generally related to the variation of transmissivity in the hole concentrations are highest in zones with high permeability e g 85 m bgs and 160 m bgs while low permeable zones or areas with no fractures are dominated by concentrations below the reporting limit e g 50 to 60 m bgs the tce profile shows several instances of diffusion halos emanating from individual fractures which is an excellent indication of active and continuous groundwater flow fig 4 tce detections often aligned with signs of flow from the als data fig 6 a d overall tce detections were associated with 97 of the active fractures selected from the core informed otv log 91 were quantifiable and 6 were detected but not quantifiable multiple tce detections were often attributed to a single flowing fracture when multiple samples were taken within the diffusion halo however due to the age of the contaminant plumes at this site it is possible for tce to have been flushed from the fractures and therefore the absence of contamination does not necessarily mean a fracture does not transmit flow especially in zones with significant permeability or deeper below the groundwater surface where contaminant concentrations would be attenuated with distance from the releases at the ground surface this was confirmed by the clear presence of back diffusion halos e g chapman and parker 2005 where tce concentration increased in the matrix away from the fracture such as at 105 2 m bgs fig 6d 4 2 4 selection of active fractures the strongest signs of flow from the four independent datasets include t values als temperature deviations aligned with fractures and quantifiable voc detections associated with fractures weaker signs of flow include misaligned als signals and non quantifiable voc detections the core descriptions could not be included as a strong indicator of flow initially because it was not evident which of the recorded descriptions were consistent signs of flow therefore the strength of the visual descriptions of fractures in the core log was assessed based on the frequency in which they were supported by other strong flow indicators in zones where other data were available table 2 bedding parallel fractures defined using otv data were also included in this assessment oxidation both on surface and diffused mineralization and smooth fractures have a high conditional probability 10 that they are supported by at least two independent strong flow indicators and were therefore considered strong indicators of flow the correlation between bedding parallel fractures and two or more strong signs of flow was inconsistent conditional probability of 1 2 and was therefore considered a weak indicator a total of 99 fractures were classified as active based on the multiple datasets table 3 summarizes how many independent strong signs of flow are associated with the active fractures selected twelve fractures were selected that were associated with strong flow evidence from all four independent data sets resulting in the highest level of confidence possible from these data sets eighty five fractures were selected that were associated with strong evidence of flow from three independent data sets only two fractures were selected with two types of strong flow evidence in both cases the fractures needed to be selected because there was measurable t in the zone and other fractures with a higher amount of evidence were not present in the zone in the first instance 70 94 mbgs the fracture was selected because it was the only fracture present in a packer zone with a measurable t value 1 4 10 6 m2 s and it had a quantifiable voc detection this fracture was also supported by a misaligned als signal that we have high confidence is related to this fracture because there are no other fractures in this portion of the hole in the second instance two fractures existed in the tested zone 1 6 10 6 m2 s but the fracture at 141 69 m bgs was selected because it appeared smooth was closest to a misaligned als signal and had a voc j detection the approach and data used in this study identified 99 active fractures over the 161 5 m of borehole analyzed resulting in an average active fracture spacing of 1 63 m and an average active fracture frequency of 0 61 fractures m 98 percent of the active fractures were confirmed with 3 or more independent lines of evidence example zones where multiple lines of evidence are used are illustrated in fig 6 with three examples of fracture and data alignments for active fractures that have strong flow evidence from at least 3 independent data sets fig 6a is an example of an active fracture at 68 m bgs selected from 4 independent datasets including a straddle packer interval with a t value of 2 1 10 5 m2 s a core description of bedding aligned a distinct cooling peak above the threshold for flow in the als dataset and a rock core voc sample taken at the fracture face with a tce concentration of 0 022 µg l fig 6b is another example of 2 active fractures at 106 4 and 107 4 m bgs selected from 3 independent datasets where two high angle fractures are aligned with separate als detections and were present in zones with t values of 2 4 10 6 m2 s and 2 1 10 6 m2 s respectively even though each fracture shows an als peak above the minimum response for fracture flow red line there are lesser signals on both sides of the peak that may be related to the effect of a high angle fracture on the als response tce was also detected at both fracture faces and into the surrounding matrix suggesting diffusion from the fracture into the matrix fig 6c shows an example of a highly fractured zone from 162 4 to 163 5 m bgs six continuous orange and one minor open grey fractures were selected based on their alignment to an als signal above the threshold tce detections across all fractures and significant transmissivity in the zone the use of multiple lines of evidence for hydraulically active fractures shows that 40 of those features logged as features with the traditional data sets core and otv atv logs are active and connected sufficiently to contribute to transport in groundwater at the plume scale ninety nine active fractures identified over the 166 m saturated length of the borehole produces an average frequency of 0 59 fractures m average spacing of 1 7 fractures m but were highly variable with a higher frequency of fractures in finer grained siltstone shale and laminated sandstones fig 7 it is noteworthy that there are four highly competent zones in the borehole where no fractures were observed over continuous lengths of 4 1 m 4 5 m 4 8 m and 6 7 m the borehole was divided into mechanical units using the cumulative fracture frequency method described by la pointe 2010 which uses changes in fracture frequency in cumulative fracture intensity plots p10 to identify mechanical layer boundaries the cumulative active fracture intensity plot for the study core hole presented in fig 7 shows the distribution of active fractures with depth and displays reasonably clear indications of changes in the fracture frequency by changes in the slope a total of 10 mechanical layers were identified with active fracture frequencies ranging from 0 fractures m to 2 69 fractures m table 4 fractures below the 10th layer were not included because they may only represent a partial layer the mechanical layer boundaries typically coincide with zones where no fractures were observed in the otv log however in two cases at 58 and 136 m bgs there is misalignment because the informed fractures were identified as inactive from the multiple datasets this is a unique aspect of using the active fracture distribution for the p10 and mechanical layer delineations as it depicts the boundaries determined from the active interconnected fractures rather than all the visible fractures produced using core or borehole imaging logs and may be a more realistic distribution of layer boundaries for hydrogeologic purposes this analysis also quantifies the variability of the active fracture density with depth providing a means for informing the vertical anisotropy that influences the flow and transport processes at the site 4 2 5 fracture orientation and selection bias the commercial software package fracman golder 2021 was used to identify and assign each of the core informed otv fractures to one of the site s three dominant fracture sets a beddingparallel set a northeast southwest nesw striking set and a northwest southeast nwse striking set identified by outcrop analysis completed by cilona 2016 the results of the analysis are presented using a rose diagram of fracture dip direction for the bedding set fig 8 a and fracture strike for the nesw and nwse sets fig 8b fifty one percent 51 of the sampled fractures were classified as bedding parallel with a total count of 120 fig 8c and a dominant dip direction between 300 and 320 the remaining 116 fractures were classified into one of the two sub vertical joint sets these fractures are oriented roughly perpendicular to the bedding and share a mean dip of 55 fig 8b shows the dominant strike is 10 to 20 for the nesw set and 300 to 310 for the nwse set with relative intensities of 26 and 23 respectively the relative intensity of each fracture set after the selection of active fractures remains relatively consistent fig 8c with the nesw set increasing by 4 to 30 the nwse set decreasing by 4 to 19 and the bedding set remaining unchanged at 51 of the total active fractures the dominant dip direction and strike change slightly after the active fracture selection with the bedding set becoming dominated by fractures in the 310 to 320 range with the nwse set seeing the most active fractures in this range the distribution of strike directions for active fractures in the nesw set remains the same it is important to recognize that the use of a single vertical borehole for this investigation produces a sample that is biased to contain a lower number of fractures than the actual amount this bias arises because the probability of a borehole intersecting any given fracture decreases as the fracture s dip angle approaches the borehole angle in the case of a vertical borehole the more vertical a fracture is the lower the probability of intersection the terzaghi method terzaghi 1965 was used to produce a more accurate estimate of the true fracture distribution by applying a geometric correction factor based on the angle between the borehole and the normal to each fracture the terzaghi corrected frequency for each fracture set was generated using the fracman software a comparison of the uncorrected and corrected fracture frequencies shows that all three sets were under sampled with the bedding set corrected frequency increasing by a factor of 1 2 the nesw by 2 9 and the nwse set by 2 7 fig 9 a and 9b after the correction the nesw set becomes the dominant set with a fracture frequency of 0 95 fractures m followed by the bedding set with 0 81 fractures m while the nwse has the smallest frequency of 0 65 fractures m the terzaghi corrected fracture frequency was also computed for each of the mechanical layers to produce a more realistic representation of the fracture variability with depth table 4 the average fracture frequency in the mechanical layers that contain fractures increase by factors ranging from 1 1 to 2 7 and is dependent on the number of sub vertical fractures in the layer the sampling bias has implications for the reported active fracture frequencies as it is likely that active fractures were also under sampled however to what degree is impossible to determine a possible method for correcting the active fracture frequency would be to apply the percentage of active fractures observed in a given mechanical unit to the respective corrected fracture frequency as is presented in table 4 when making assumptions regarding the number of missed active fractures it is important to note that the terzaghi method has limitations as it tends to overestimate fractures with orientations very close to that of the borehole axis golder 2021 4 2 6 rec fractures the critical reynolds number approach was used to estimate the number of fractures in seventeen 1 5 m zones where constant head step tests were conducted and the number of fractures determined in these zones based on the onset of non darcian flow ranged from 1 to 3 fractures fig 10 shows the two plots resulting from this method fig 10a compares the data from each zone where the rec is calculated from the largest darcian flow rate and the aperture is calculated assuming 1 fracture illustrating that the data does not fit the logarithmic curve whereas in 10b all of the zones fit the relationship well when the number of fractures is changed it should be noted that the hydraulic behavior observed in each zone is a blended response dominated by the largest fractures present as mentioned previously this fit is only possible by using a partial number of fractures that accounts for deviations from the cubic law such as excessive frictional losses aperture distributions within a single fracture or different fractures with different apertures in essence using a partial number of fractures in each zone to fit the curve indicates that the fractures in each zone are not the same size the partial number of fractures does not directly represent the number of fractures present rather it is an effective number of fractures tied to an average aperture assuming all fractures are the same size for example if a zone needs to use 1 8 fractures to fit the lab curve when each fractures has a different aperture the zone likely has 2 or more fractures of different sizes more work is needed to fully understand the methodology for allocating the rec partial number of fractures into multiple fractures with different apertures however it is reasonable to assume that this method is biased to the largest fractures in the test zone because these fractures will exhibit non linear behavior at low applied head based on the 17 test intervals on average 49 8 of the fractures identified from the otv log are participating in the hydraulic test and applying this percentage to all zones where a t was measured but a constant head step test was not conducted increases the size of the rec dataset for a better comparison with the multiple lines of evidence approach presented in this paper this comparison is presented in table s1 in the supporting information showing relatively good agreement between the two methods 4 3 hydraulic aperture estimates for active fractures when characterizing bedrock aquifer systems the fracture parameters needed to simulate transport are typically deduced from hydraulic tests using the measured t values and the cubic law to calculate hydraulic apertures but also depend on an estimate of the fractures present therefore identifying the number of active fractures will improve estimates of hydraulic aperture for groundwater flow and transport simulations chapman et al 2013 parker et al 2018 mclaren et al 2012 the hydraulic aperture distribution calculated using the t value from the packer tests with the 99 active fractures identified is presented in fig 11 these hydraulic apertures ranged from 44 µm to 713 µm with a geometric mean of 185 µm and an arithmetic mean of 232 µm these hydraulic apertures follow a log normal distribution consistent with other fractured sedimentary rock studies stone 1984 dverstorp and andersson 1989 dverstorp et al 1992 nordqvist et al 1992 it is important to note that the distribution of active fractures and the estimation of apertures are based on observations in a single corehole and is therefore only a one dimensional representation of the site conditions future work should be done to evaluate the distributions of active fractures within the sedimentological and structural geology aspects of the site including proximity to fault structures 5 key observations conclusions the methodology presented in this paper offers a multiple lines of evidence approach for determining the number and distribution of hydraulically active fractures in the studied borehole the workflow presented is based on a combination of conventional and newer high resolution borehole methods to synergistically use multiple measurements that are subject to specific bias or uncertainty including a core informed otv log t values from flute transmissivity profiling and straddle packer tests als temperature logging inside a lined borehole calibrated to represent flow through fractures and voc concentrations from high frequency rock core sampling the identification of active fractures is an important component of fractured rock characterization and provides input parameters on fracture frequency and apertures from field data at the resolution needed for flow and transport models that inform plume migration distances and fluxes using existing discrete fracture matrix dfm numerical models several dfm numerical models exist commercially but are rarely used by the hydrogeologic profession likely because the fracture network parameters for informing these models are difficult to obtain using conventional data sets this study shows that the multiple lines of evidence approach with emphasis on the use of hydraulic based methods is useful to differentiate the active fractures allowing improved estimation of hydraulic apertures the core informed otv log is a powerful tool that can be used with high resolution hydraulic methods such as als logging careful straddle packer testing as well as rock core contaminant analyses that target diffusion haloes adjacent to observed fractures to minimize inherent biases by assessing agreement between methods when identifying active fractures finally the critical reynolds number approach based on the onset of nonlinear flow showed good agreement with the number of active fractures identified throughout the 160 m long borehole since the rec approach is dominated by the largest fractures present it is expected that the active fractures selected can be greater than the number of rec fractures when there are multiple smaller fractures present in the test zone these multiple data sets are collected in bedrock investigations but typically are not used to deduce fracture network parameters the variable nature of the fracture networks and distinguishing which fractures are important for groundwater flow and transport i e are hydraulically connected is one of the most challenging aspects of fractured rock hydrogeology dershowitz 2014 berkowitz 2002 and neuman 2005 and as we show in this study this effort will benefit from higher resolution

2172,it is widely known that flow in fractured sedimentary rock is dominated by the interconnected fractures in the rock mass but it is difficult to determine which fractures observed in boreholes are active meaning they transmit water under natural gradient conditions a methodology is presented that uses optical televiewer otv and continuous core logs synergistically with flute transmissivity t profiling straddle packer testing rock core permeability testing active line source temperature logs and rock core voc concentration profiles to determine the number and position of active fractures in a 196 meter borehole in sandstone the application of this methodology indicates that 40 of the identified fractures are active in this borehole with a frequency of 0 61 active fractures per meter which compares well with the number of fractures identified with the straddle packer rec method used in the largest transmissive zones while the low transmissivity zones tested are consistent with laboratory measured rock matrix hydraulic conductivity high resolution hydraulically based methods provide the necessary evidence to improve estimates of active fractures that control solute transport this paper demonstrates how multiple spatially resolved data sets can be used synergistically to inform fracture network parameters thereby constraining hydraulic aperture and surface area calculations that control flow and diffusion with the aim of improving the estimation of plume migration rates and mass discharge to receptors in fractured sedimentary rocks keywords hydraulically active fractures fractured sedimentary rocks straddle packer testing temperature logging rock core voc profiles core log data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction bedrock aquifers are some of the most prolific sources of high quality groundwater including all types of sedimentary igneous and metamorphic rocks and it is the fractures that dominate bedrock bulk hydraulic conductivity in these systems despite the fracture void volume being extremely small typically between 1 10 2 to 1 10 5 freeze and cherry 1979 therefore characterizing the fracture network is essential for estimating groundwater travel times i e velocities or residence times to evaluate the vulnerability of an aquifer to contaminants effective fracture porosity is often determined from estimates of hydraulic apertures within a subsurface volume but reliable estimates are confounded by the difficulty of determining the active fracture distribution from field data the importance of identifying active fractures and quantifying flow in fractured rock systems has motivated the oil and gas industry to develop new and improved methods to increase yield but the conditions and challenges required in freshwater hydrogeology require higher resolution measurements for contaminant transport arrival time and mass discharge predictions and site remediation given the need for improved hydrogeologic conceptual site models the scientific community has pursued new methods for identifying and quantifying fracture activity connectivity over the past 20 years flowmeter logging has become a standard tool for identifying the location of active features in boreholes keys sullivan 1979 ren et al 2018 the conventional impellor flowmeter tool has evolved into the development of heat pulse hess 1986 and electromagnetic molz et al 1994 flowmeter logging techniques that allow for the measurement of flow rates at much lower velocities with and without pumping thereby improving flow estimates paillet 1998 2000 williams paillet 2002 temperature and or fluid conductivity profiling in an open borehole can also identify flowing fractures using highly sensitive sensors to identify small temperature or electrical conductivity variations within the water column caused by the depth discrete inflow of water drury 1984 williams conger 1990 klepikova et al 2011 suski et al 2008 tsang et al 1989 introduced a method using conductivity logs taken in a borehole after replacing the borehole fluid with either deionized or saline water relatively conductive formation water entering the borehole appears as a peak or trough in the fluid conductivity profile that can be compared to geophysical image logs to identify the position of flowing i e active fractures however the information gained from these logging tools is limited because data is collected under open borehole conditions where the highest transmissive fractures intersecting the borehole will dominate the flow in out of the borehole because of the cross connection of fractures with differing head wilson et al 2001 pehme et al 2007 quinn et al 2016 even when best practices are employed these methods are relatively insensitive to intermediate and smaller active fractures e g nas 2020 parker et al 2018 rushton howard 1982 and therefore open hole testing is biased to identify only the highest transmissive fractures during logging work has also been done to detect and characterize active fractures through cross hole testing of multiple boreholes paillet et al 1987 le borgne et al 2006 illman 2014 but these are extensions of the above methods with similar biases and are often performed to obtain bulk values for hydraulic conductivity i e discerning more than the most transmissive fractures contributing to flow remains difficult additional efforts to improve detection limits for flow include the incorporation of flow diverters with heat pulse flowmeters to limit vertical flow within a discrete zone so that horizontal flow data can be collected however these results are often impacted in boreholes with large vertical flow pehme et al 2007 flexible liners have been used to temporarily seal boreholes to remove the influence of the open hole on fluid flow and hydraulic head distributions cherry et al 2007 pehme et al 2007 2011 2013 installed a flexible impermeable liner filled with water to create a temporary borehole seal thereby returning the system to ambient flow conditions before collecting temperature logs using an active heat source with continuous cable in the stagnant water column inside the liner the active line source als method involves heating the water in the sealed borehole and collecting a series of temperature profiles using a highly sensitive sensor 10 3 c resolution to detect cooling caused by flowing features intersecting the sealed borehole similarly active fibre optic distributed temperature sensing a dts has been deployed in boreholes using a flexible liner to seal the cable against the borehole wall to provide continuous temperature profiles over time in heated boreholes coleman et al 2015 bense et al 2016 maldaner et al 2019 munn et al 2020 these temperature methods in sealed boreholes offer enhanced temporal and spatial resolution when compared to conventional open hole trolling based techniques allowing for improved identification of hydraulically active fractures hydrologic characterization of fractured rock often relies on straddle packer tests to determine transmissivity t in depth discrete intervals but estimates of hydraulic apertures are plagued by the uncertainty in the number of fractures contributing to flow in the test interval e g maini 1971 magnusson duran 1984 lapcevic 1988 andersson et al 1988 quinn et al 2011b some researchers have focussed testing on individual fractures e g novakowski et al 1985 novakowski 1988 novakowski et al 2006 but in most cases it is impractical to test all fractures individually in long boreholes quinn et al 2011a b proposed a methodology to use the hydraulic behavior of the tested zone i e the onset of nonlinear flow to determine the effective number of fractures participating in the response in support of this approach quinn et al 2020 conducted an in depth review of published laboratory studies on flow through single rock fractures with known conditions and for those few studies which measured linear data and physically measured the fracture aperture empirically derived a logarithmic relationship between the critical reynolds number and the measured fracture aperture the visual inspection of rock core allows for the identification of fracture surface characteristics that are related to signs of fluid movement physical or chemical weathering mineral precipitates oxidation staining striations etc that can be used to infer the distribution of active fractures in a properly cored hole e g magnusson duran 1984 west and kueper 2004 west et al 2005 however the usefulness of this method is extremely dependent on the quality of the rock core as well as the experience and consistency of the individual s logging it is also difficult to conclude if evidence for flow observed in the core reflects current flow conditions or if the flow conditions have changed over the lifespan of the fracture this is especially true in areas of frequent tectonic activity as is the case for this and many study sites it is also possible for an active fracture to have no visual evidence of flow these uncertainties indicate that the quality and or usefulness of a core log can vary to a much greater extent than other more quantitative data collected e g sampling and analysis head profiles etc all these methods for identifying active fractures have limitations that can only be reconciled using multiple data sets to remove the inherent bias or limits of detection for each method this study promotes the use of new and traditional high resolution borehole datasets that are used synergistically as a more robust decision framework to enumerate hydraulically active fractures it presents a multiple lines of evidence approach using a subset of new and conventional high resolution borehole characterization methods presented within the discrete fracture network matrix field approach described by parker et al 2012 this use of complementary methods provides insights into the strength and limitations of various techniques for active fracture identification ultimately improving confidence in the selection data was collected at an industrial site used for field research with trichloroethylene tce contamination that occurred decades ago but where much effort has been applied to use multiple field methods at a higher resolution than is typical for standard practice as part of scientific inquiry this field based research is aimed at improving our understanding of individual processes affecting plume behaviour in fractured sedimentary rocks through better characterization of the fracture network affecting both flow and transport fracture aperture and frequency are linked parameters and influence the advection diffusion interactions and plume characteristics over time affecting rates of plume front migration internal plume concentration distributions and remediation process understanding leads to improved parameter inputs for numerical models that support decision making 2 study site description and hydrogeology this study was conducted at the santa susana field laboratory ssfl located approximately 65 km northwest of downtown los angeles in southern california fig 1 a where tce was first discovered in groundwater at the site in 1984 investigations to characterize groundwater contamination motivated by environmental regulations continued from 1985 to the present using novel high resolution field methods as part of a field based research program parker et al 2011 2012 ssfl is bounded to the north by the simi valley to the west by the san fernando valley and to the south by the santa monica mountains the study site overlies the late cretaceous chatsworth formation a deep sea turbidite deposit that consists primarily of sandstones interbedded with lesser amounts of shale and siltstone link et al 1984 mwh 2004 cilona et al 2016 did extensive fracture mapping of the exposed bedrock fig 1b over the scale of the site 2850 acres 5 5 by 2 5 km distances the study corehole c 10 intersects the canyon member in what is informally referred to as the upper chatsworth formation montgomery watson 2000 the lithology of this unit is almost exclusively comprised of coarse medium and fine grained sandstones 96 with occasional fine grained silt and shale beds 4 individual fine grained beds are generally less than 1 m thick and typically less than 0 3 m thick sandstone beds between the fine grained members may be laterally extensive and are typically more than 3 m thick mwh 2009 coarse grained sandstone members with few or no fine grained interbeds commonly show turbidite deposit characteristics cilona et al 2016 c 10 was completed very near a known source of tce contamination within 200 ft as a vertical telescoping core hole with an 8 inch diameter surface casing drilled from 0 to 15 2 m below ground surface bgs a drilled 5 inch diameter borehole from 15 2 to 30 3 m bgs and a 4 inch diameter cored hole to the completion depth of 196 m bgs 166 m cored hole the top of bedrock is approximately 2 7 m bgs and the open hole water level varies between 26 7 and 27 3 m bgs the lithology observed in the extracted core is predominantly sandstone with interbedded siltstone sandstone and shale present sporadically throughout the hole this core hole intersected a small fault feature at 103 m bgs and a major fault known as the shear zone dipping 75 nnw near the bottom of the hole at approximately 190 5 m bgs both of which were identified by an abundance of fault gouge the coring stopped shortly after detecting the shear zone to avoid piercing through the fault the shear zone has been shown to be a barrier to both groundwater flow and contaminant migration based on groundwater monitoring groundwater level differences and pumping tests cilona et al 2016 for example c10 is located on the se side of the fault where the depth to water dtw is typically 30 m bgs while in c11 on the nw side of the shear zone the dtw is over 60 m bgs a twelve port flute multilevel system installed in this hole indicates that the vertical gradient in c10 is 2 8 m over 180 m of the borehole length comprised of smaller upward and downward gradients throughout the hole 3 approach and methods the intensive site characterization work that occurred in the study borehole using novel borehole techniques provides a unique opportunity to use multiple high quality data sets synergistically to assess the potential for specific fractures to be hydraulically active continuous coring allowed for detailed logging at the cm scale for matrix and fracture characteristics as well as lithology rock core voc sampling near and away from fractures and rock core testing for matrix physical properties including porosity wet and dry bulk densities and permeability otv video and natural gamma geophysical logs were collected following the coring and development of the hole finally data from unique hydraulic methods including als temperature logging e g pehme et al 2013 and selective high resolution straddle packer testing at 1 5 m long depth discrete intervals over 73 of the saturated borehole length guided by a flute liner transmissivity profile quinn et al 2015 keller et al 2013 3 1 continuous core and geophysical logs informing fractures the first step in the identification of active fractures involves the correlation of the core descriptions with the otv log both logs contain information about lithology and fractures and therefore both lithology and fractures are used to correlate the logs these logs are collected independently and have different inherent errors and uncertainties which are minimized when the logs are correlated visual inspection and logging of the core at the cm scale provides information about the lithology as well as fracture depths dip angles and physical description of the fractures and or the rock matrix and the core was photographed at the end of each core run fracture descriptions include evidence of flow such as oxidation staining mineral precipitation silt or sand deposits weathering of the fracture surface striations bedding plane features or evidence of lack of flow such as clay infilling or complete mineralization i e healed fracture some of the core descriptions are very specific while others are more generic for example many fractures were described as having some or trace silt on the fracture surface whereas fewer fractures were described as having a measurable thickness of silt on the surface i e 1 mm or 2 5 mm thick the same holds true for oxidation staining which varied from trace staining on the fracture surface to oxidation staining extending 5 60 mm into the matrix from the fracture both the signs of flow and the degree magnitude of these descriptions were assessed to identify the most consistent signs of flow from the core description that is supported by other hydraulic based methods used in this study the main errors that typically arise in core logs are related to poor rock quality i e broken zones and incomplete core recovery both of which can result in unidentified features and cause errors in recovered core depths drilling induced fractures mechanical breaks are also a source of error as their identification is subjective and relies heavily upon the experience of the individual logging the core for this reason all mechanical breaks identified in the core log for this study are retained and assessed through comparison to the otv log the otv log provides a continuous image of the borehole wall from which the depth dip and strike of all features can be determined as well as the location of fine grained units dip and orientation data were used to identify the dominant fracture sets and determine the average dip and direction of the bedding each fracture identified in the otv log was classified as either open there is a measurable aperture at the borehole wall complete can easily see the entire fracture trace or incomplete cannot see the entire fracture trace otv logs are limited by their image resolution and can be impacted by run speed and poor water clarity however the quality of the otv log collected in this study was considered excellent due to the clarity of the borehole water efforts were made to achieve the highest quality log possible by allowing sufficient time after hole development for suspended particles to settle before beginning the correlation of the core and otv logs care was taken to ensure that the geophysical logs were properly referenced to the ground surface to match the reference of the core log the otv log is considered the best estimate of the depths of the lithology and fractures because it is a continuous wireline log using an encoder to monitor depth during logging and the depths compared well with the video log that was collected the gamma log was compared against the otv log using gamma spikes an indication of clay or shale to confirm the depths of the siltstone and shale units that were readily observable in the otv the core log was examined in detail together with core photos fig 1c and the rock core voc sampling logs to identify any errors in recovery length lithology depth or thickness fracture depths and to identify features that were missed in the logging process because the depth errors in the core log are not uniform throughout the hole fracture and lithology information from only the recovered sections of each core run were used to represent each run in many cases the recovery recorded in the core log did not match the recovery documented in the core photo in these instances the photo was considered the most accurate in many runs the core photo clearly showed that the recovery was greater than 5 ft 1 5 m which is reasonable up to a maximum of 4 in 0 1 m which is the extra space between the core catcher and the core bit i e core shoe the extra recovered length was always considered to impact the true starting depth of the next run and the starting depths were adjusted accordingly runs longer than 5 ft cause the recovered run depths to slightly increase while lost recovery results in gaps between the runs allowing for adjustments of the run depths during correlation without disturbing the runs above or below care was taken to ensure that no runs overlapped during this procedure if a run was shifted down to match the otv and there was no space below for the shift all runs below had to shift to prevent overlap until the shift eventually became accommodated by recovery loss these are common challenges with core logs thereby rendering a borehole image log invaluable for validating and improving the information from core logs clay rich units had a strong colour contrast from the surrounding sandstone and were therefore easily identified in both the otv and the core these lithologies were used for the primary correlation because they are quickly and easily distinguished in both the core and otv log once the core lithology was shifted to match the otv log the fractures and voc samples in each respective run were shifted an equal amount then each fracture in the aligned core log was correlated to the fractures present in the otv log by comparing the angle recorded in the core log to the dip measured in the otv often the depths between the correlated fractures were not exact i e 10 cm due to the errors inherent in the coring process i e core retrieval recovery loss rock pulverization imprecise measurement etc mechanical breaks were also evaluated through a comparison to otv at this time fractures originally recorded as mechanical breaks that had no counterpart in the otv log were considered true mechanical breaks but if a corresponding otv fracture was observed the mechanical break was re classified as a natural feature in instances where fractures were observed in otv but not in the corresponding core run the core photos typically showed that the fractures were indiscernible in the extracted core because of poor rock quality i e heavily fractured zones where it was not possible to distinguish between individual fractures once individual fractures are correlated the visual descriptions of fractures in the core log are used to inform the corresponding fractures in the otv log to produce what is here on referred to as the core informed otv log an example of the correlation process using lithology identifying a mechanical break and transferring core descriptions to the otv log is illustrated in fig 2 it should be noted that during core logging when the hole was tagged throughout the coring process usually at the beginning or end of the day the tag depth was recorded and the core logger used that depth as the current depth regardless of the depth of the previous run if the tag depth was less than the previous run the core log indicated an overlap and when it was deeper it showed a space between runs in this study the correlation of the core log to the otv log proved to be an excellent method to assess the accuracy of depths tagged during drilling 3 2 high resolution methods for identifying hydraulic activity a mixture of standard and newer innovative methods were used synergistically with the core informed otv log to identify the hydraulically active fractures these include high resolution selective straddle packer testing e g quinn et al 2015 standard laboratory matrix permeability testing on rock core als temperature logging in a lined borehole pehme et al 2010 and 2014 and standard rock core voc analyses e g sterling et al 2005 parker et al 2012 parker et al 2018 3 2 1 straddle packer testing and matrix physical properties testing selective straddle packer testing using a 1 5 m test interval was conducted over 73 of the saturated length of the borehole with transducers monitoring above and below the tested interval seventeen constant head step tests were conducted in the most permeable zones while 54 pneumatic slug tests were conducted in the remaining zones the flute t profile keller et al 2013 was used as a guide for selective packer testing but was also used to assess the correction for short circuiting to the open hole identified from transducer monitoring above and below the test interval during the straddle packer tests by comparing the t values of the entire hole quinn et al 2016 these hydraulic datasets were also combined to provide an improved t profile of the borehole quinn et al 2015 this t profile was subsequently used to assess the potential for permeable fractures in each tested zone in many of the zones where pneumatic slug tests were initiated the air in the riser pipe was pressurized and the interval pressure increased and remained constant for at least 5 min or recovered very slightly i e 1 cm over a 15 minute time span indicating that no water or very little water was displaced from the test zone these zones were assigned a t value of 5 10 8 m2 s based on what is considered the lower limit of the testing equipment which is equivalent to a flow rate of 5 ml min i e solving the thiem equation for flow using 1 m of applied head an analysis of the otv and core fracture data showed that in many cases there were no observable fractures in these zones indicating that a lack of hydraulic response is likely an indication that there are no hydraulically active fractures this was further supported by lab permeability tests conducted on 18 samples collected in four cored holes through the same lithostratigraphic unit within 61 m of the study borehole 3 2 2 als temperature logging in sealed boreholes the active line source temperature logging data in a lined borehole was collected and processed as described in pehme et al 2013 to generate thermal deviation logs where each aberration in the thermal deviation log represents a change in temperature that suggests a fracture with active flow in this methodology a cable was lowered into the lined hole to heat the static water column in the liner resulting in raising the temperature of the water in the lined hole by an average of 0 79 c then a high resolution temperature probe with a resolution of 10 4 c was used to measure temperature variability with depth at 1 h and 4 h after heating was stopped the signals from the thermal deviation logs were placed into five categories based on the relative magnitude of the temperature change very low low moderate high and very high the als temperature logging method is considered a qualitative log that identifies very small temperature deviations that have been shown to correspond to active flow pehme et al 2007 2013 but may not always be indicators of hydraulically significant fractures because it does not distinguish between fracture or matrix flow to quantify the magnitude of cooling that constitutes matrix flow the als signals were assessed at depths that contained no visible fractures in the core or otv logs and within the straddle packer intervals that showed no hydraulic response to determine the maximum amount of cooling that would constitute evidence for matrix flow 3 2 3 rock core voc concentration profiles the rock core was sampled for voc analysis sterling et al 2005 parker et al 2012 parker et al 2018 at an average frequency of 2 5 samples per meter throughout the cored hole each rock sample was crushed and transferred to 125 ml wide mouth voa jars with teflon screw caps containing 60 ml of hplc grade methanol weighed before and after the sample was added to determine a wet weight of crushed rock typically 100 g a five week extraction period using the shake flask technique at 4 c was performed to ensure complete extraction of the analytes from the rock into the methanol analysis of the chlorinated ethenes in the methanol was done using the analytical procedure described by gorecka et al 2001 where aliquots of the methanol were injected directly into a gas chromatograph for separation and quantification using a micro electron capture detector the total voc concentrations include contributions from sorbed dissolved and any immiscible phase dnapl when present the study focuses on tce because it was consistently detected throughout the borehole and was detected at the highest concentrations making it the best candidate as the contaminant tracer 3 3 workflow for selecting active fractures the workflow for selecting active fractures is outlined in fig 3 the first step for selecting active fractures was correlating the otv and natural gamma logs to the core log data this was followed by a direct comparison of fractures identified in the core informed otv log with the packer testing derived transmissivities the als thermal deviation log and voc concentration profiles all features were individually assessed against all available flow evidence to identify the most likely hydraulically active fractures the greater the number of flow indicators from the different datasets that aligned with each fracture the greater the confidence in the fracture being active the likelihood of a fracture being active was determined by counting the number of independent forms of evidence visual evidence from core als signals voc detections and transmissivity above the average lab matrix values that aligned with specific features in contrast fractures in packer zones with no measurable transmissivity were considered not active or connected given the method resolution was similar to the mean matrix hydraulic conductivity the indicators of flow were also used to evaluate the strength of the visual flow signs recorded in the core log before these signs were used to help determine the active fractures it is important to note that it is difficult to assign an instance of flow evidence from als voc or packer t to an individual fracture when features are intersecting because it is impossible to determine which of the intersecting fractures is contributing to the observed sign of flow in this study the decision was made to assign the evidence to all intersecting fractures when this was the case this could result in a slight overestimation of the true number of active fractures within the borehole and must be considered when assessing the results 3 4 critical reynolds number analysis a relatively new method using the onset of non darcian flow in a constant head step test e g quinn et al 2011b was used to estimate the number of hydraulically active fractures in the most permeable zones using the logarithmic relationship between the critical reynolds number rec and the physically measured aperture 2b from laboratory tests on single fractures empirically determined by quinn et al 2020 this methodology assumes that the fractures participating in the hydraulic test follow the cubic law relatively well so only the results from the laboratory studies where the fractures were physically measured and linear data was collected were used in the determination of this relationship it is reasonable to assume that this relationship will apply to the hydraulic apertures calculated from the straddle packer tests the cubic law defines the hydraulic aperture 2bh as 2 2 b h 12 μ t ρ g 3 where μ is the water viscosity m lt ρ is the density of water m l3 g is the gravitational acceleration l t2 t is the transmissivity l2 t and n is the number of permeable fractures present it should be noted that there are two commonly used terms for the fracture aperture e and 2bh the 2bh term comes from the mathematics for flow through smooth parallel plates where symmetry is used to simplify the solution by solving for half the aperture b thereby making 2b the height of the entire aperture quinn et al 2020 used this form of the cubic law to determine the relationship between rec and the measured aperture for all of the laboratory tests presented in the literature that measured linear flow in the hydraulic test and physically measured the aperture however field researchers have historically assumed one fracture in each tested zone or modified the cubic law when more than one fracture was identified in a tested zone by dividing t by the number of fractures assuming that each fracture is the same size neither of these assumptions is ideal because the tools commonly used to identify fractures i e core log and image logs typically identify more than one fracture in each tested zone and rarely indicate that fractures are the same size snow 1970 addressed the assumption of same size fractures for calculating apertures and stated that the aperture calculated using this assumption is the same as the mean of the distribution apertures because there is no widely accepted methodology for dealing with multiple fractures in a straddle packer test intervals the rec method also assumes that all fractures detected are the same size the procedure begins by plotting rec calculated at the largest darcian flow rate versus 2bh for all zones where a constant head step test was conducted assuming a single active fracture in each tested zone this plot typically shows that in general rec increases as 2bh increases with considerable scatter the logarithmic relationship determined by quinn et al 2020 is plotted on the same graph as a guide for the field tests then the number of fractures for each tested zone is changed to match the relationship derived from the laboratory tests an improvement of the initial methodology published in 2011 is to use a fractional number of fractures for the field tests to account for the fact that rock fractures are not smooth parallel plates i e real fractures likely have more friction because of roughness and aperture variation and fractures in the same test zone typically have different apertures i e the measured data is a blending of all active fractures present however because most of the flow will be through the largest fractures they will dominate the response therefore a non integer number of fractures is sometimes slightly smaller than an integer likely due to more friction and sometimes slightly larger than an integer indicating the blending of the responses of multiple sized fractures the number of fractures identified in the otv and core logs are used to bound the upper limit of fractures available for flow in each packer test interval as well as identify zones with no fractures where only matrix flow is present in this study the rec method was applied to 17 test intervals each 1 5 m long where a constant head step test was conducted and at least one fracture was identified the major uncertainty in this method stems from the lack of laboratory studies focused on measuring the rec vs 2bh relationship in the quinn et al 2020 review as only eleven tests from five studies were rigorous enough to be used in determining the empirically derived logarithmic relationship resulting in a range of apertures between 100 and 500 µm this forced gradient method was only used in the largest t zones and likely represent only the largest fractures present in the tested zone that carry most of the flow in the hydraulic test the average percentage of the fractures identified in the otv log that the rec approach identifies as actively carrying flow is used to determine the number of fractures in all other zones where a t value was measured by slug tests then the number of fractures identified in all zones i e the 17 zones with ch step tests and all zones where t was obtained from slug tests are compared to the number of active fractures identified using multiple datasets 3 5 technique for estimating hydraulic apertures hydraulic apertures were calculated for all portions of the hole where depth discrete transmissivity value was obtained from either straddle packer testing or flute profiling using the number of active fractures determined from the multiple datasets when more than one fracture was present in a tested zone all active fractures within a packer interval are assumed to have the same aperture zones without any active fractures were supported by measured transmissivity values equal to 1 standard deviation of the mean matrix hydraulic conductivity determined from laboratory measurements using astm d4525 90 on 18 core samples 4 results and discussion 4 1 otv core correlation a total of 157 4 m of hq core was recovered from a 166 m continuously cored hole 94 5 overall recovery correlation of core logs to the otv logs based on the lithology and fractures showed that 62 of the core runs required some depth adjustment to align these features with the otv log with most adjustments in sections of the borehole where there was incomplete or poor recovery of the 138 core runs only seven had to be shifted more than 0 3 m for six of these runs the shift was 0 37 m and one run was shifted 0 60 m the 0 6 m shift was required in run 96 a 1 5 m run which only had 1 1 m recovery and the previous 1 5 m run 95 had 0 91 m recovery despite significant core loss in this portion of the borehole the shifting did not interfere with the nearby runs the correlation process also determined that there were errors in two reported tag depths deep in the hole at 171 0 m bgs and 178 6 m bgs in both instances the reported depth was 0 3 m shallower than the true depth a small difference not easy to identify over these long borehole lengths tag depth errors can occur because of the difficulty in lowering a tag line into deeper boreholes that are typically not truly vertical or rough vuggy borehole walls or voids that can easily snag the tagline visual inspection of the rock core in the field combined with a secondary analysis of the core photos identified a total of 281 features four features were classified as broken zones with no other visual description 195 were classified as fractures 70 64 as mechanical breaks 23 12 as healed 4 and 6 were incipient 1 during the correlation process 38 fractures identified in the core log were re classified to mechanical breaks because there was no associated fracture in the otv log and 9 mechanical breaks in the core were re classified to fractures because they aligned with fractures observed in the otv in one instance the otv misidentified a fracture that was observed in the core to be a thin dark lamination the four broken zones in the core log were associated with 6 fractures in the otv log but with no evidence of flow from the core log overall based on the correlation of the core and otv the number of open fractures identified in the core became 172 and the mechanical breaks were 93 the core informed otv identified 34 competent zones 97 m defined as continuous sections of rock of at least 1 5 m with no discernable fractures fig 4 the core informed otv log identified a total of 246 fractures with 74 otv fractures not observed in the core log where there was poor recovery and poor rock quality index values i e broken up correlating core fractures to the otv log was shown to be the most effective way of establishing the true distribution of natural fractures with accurate fracture depth orientation and physical descriptions of the correlated fractures 4 1 1 evidence for flow from core observations a total of 276 descriptions of fractures potentially associated with flow were recorded in the core log oxidation staining was present in 20 fractures with the degree of staining ranging from trace surface oxidation to diffusive staining penetrating 60 mm into the rock matrix however oxidation staining was not observed below a depth of 85 m bgs thereby eliminating the use of this indicator at greater depths pyrite calcite and gypsum mineralization was observed in 25 fractures at varying degrees ranging from trace surface mineralization to complete closure of the fracture healed all nine fractures described as healed in the core log were not considered hydraulically active weathering of the fracture surface was mostly described as slightly rough 102 while slightly rough to smooth fracture surfaces were the next most common observation 10 fractures that appeared rough were observed twice and 3 fractures that appeared fresh were associated with mechanical breaks silt deposits e g grey silt reddish brown clayey silt yellowish brown sandy silt were frequently observed and described qualitatively based on the colour and thickness of material deposited on the fracture surface however thick silt deposits were often quantified by a measurement ranging from 1 mm to 5 mm thick thirty eight fractures were described as having trace silt on the surface while seventy fractures were described as having silt of varying thickness on their surface fractures with evidence of fault activity contained gouge deposits up to 30 mm thick and were identified two times 4 2 evidence for active fractures from other borehole methods the core informed otv log was then compared to evidence of flow from other high resolution methods including rock core voc detections als and transmissivity values from straddle packer tests to determine the distribution of active fractures in the borehole 4 2 1 transmissivities from straddle packer hydraulic testing selective straddle packer testing was conducted in this hole using a flute transmissivity profile as a guide for identifying moderate to high t zones as outlined by quinn et al 2015 before correction for short circuiting to the open hole a comparison of the t of the entire hole from packer testing to the flute t profile showed that the flute t was 72 less than the packer testing t and after correction the flute t was 5 less indicating that the correction process was effective at removing the error due to short circuiting in addition the calculation of the blended head using the straddle packer head and t values resulted in a blended head that was approximately 5 in 13 cm shallower than the measured value constant head step tests were conducted in 17 intervals over 25 5 m of the hole and slug tests were conducted in 57 intervals over 85 5 m of the hole where straddle packer testing was not conducted the flute profile value provided t estimates twenty five slug test intervals 31 5 m of the borehole showed no hydraulic response less than5 0 10 8 m2 s from a pneumatic slug test and therefore the fractures observed in these zones were assumed to be very small or dead end fractures not connected to the larger fracture network these extensive low permeable zones act as a barrier to vertical flow in the formation near the studied hole fig 4 shows the distribution of transmissivity throughout the borehole obtained by slug tests constant head step tests and flute profiling for zones where a response was measured values range from a minimum of 6 9 10 8 m2 s and a maximum of 5 3 10 4 m2 s transmissivity is greatest in the bottom half of the borehole below 145 0 m bgs likely due to the borehole encountering the damage zone of the shear zone fault at 190 m bgs the number of core informed otv fractures was not always consistent with the measured t for example two intervals with high fracture intensities located at 85 0 and 177 0 m bgs with fracture counts of 11 and 12 respectively correlate with high t zones while the zone from 136 to 137 m bgs where 12 fractures were identified showed no hydraulic response this illustrates the difficulty of determining the hydraulic activity of fractures using borehole imaging without the support of hydraulic tests the matrix hydraulic conductivity from the core 18 sandstone samples taken from the canyon member of the upper chatsworth formation in four nearby cored holes ranged from 1 9 10 10 m s to 1 1 10 7 m s with an average of 2 2 10 8 m s and a geometric mean of 6 4 10 9 m s table 1 however only one permeability test was in the 10 7 m s range with all other tests measuring less than 10 7 m s average matrix permeability was converted to an equivalent matrix t by multiplying by 1 5 m the packer interval length 3 3 10 8 m2 s to facilitate the comparison to the packer derived t for assessing significant flow these data show that the estimated lower limit of the packer testing equipment 5 10 8 m s is similar to the equivalent mean matrix t obtained from laboratory tests on the rock core 3 3 10 8 m s and therefore is likely smaller than originally estimated based on this comparison it is reasonable to assume that all potentially active fractures can only exist in zones where there was a measurable hydraulic response overall 74 straddle packer tests were conducted and in all zones where the t value from the packer tests was greater than 1 0 10 5 m2 s 24 zones the largest matrix equivalent t 1 8 10 7 m s can be considered negligible when all t values are given to one decimal place the lower values of matrix permeability measured in the lab are most likely associated with the lower t zones and therefore would also be negligible if the field measured t was greater than 1 10 6 m2 s 16 zones when the packer tests measured t values were less than 1x10 6 but greater than 5x10 8 m2 s 13 zones the t value may have been influenced by the matrix permeability thereby overestimating the apertures in these zones if there were no active fractures selected it was assumed that flow was dominated by the matrix twenty one straddle packer zones 32 m showed no hydraulic response 5 10 8 m2 s these zones likely minimize vertical flow in the formation in this part of the flow system 4 2 2 active line source temperature profiles in flute lined boreholes evidence of cooling within the lined heated borehole appears as peaks in the thermal deviation log the amplitude of the peak referred to as the cooling signal is the observed change in water temperature at that depth and is related to the amount of flow carrying heat away at the borehole wall pehme et al 2013 a total of 798 cooling signals were identified with magnitudes ranging from 0 0057 to 0 0432 c the weakest very low low als signals show poor correlation to fractures in the informed otv log and were commonly observed in parts of the hole with no observable fractures e g between 150 m bgs to 153 m bgs this suggests that these low magnitude signals may not be associated with active fractures and instead likely result from flow through the porous matrix or are simply noise in the data these nonideal signals were assessed where fractures were not identified and in zones with no hydraulic response resulting in the minimum cooling signal associated with fracture flow of 0 0175 c fig 5 when the signals above this cooling threshold are used the correlation between the als signals and the informed otv fractures is significantly improved a total of 160 signals above the cooling threshold were detected over the 150 m of the hole that was analyzed 142 moderate flow signals 0 0175 c to 0 02 c 16 high signals 0 02 c to 0 03 c and 2 very high signals 0 03 c to 0 04 c in some cases the als signals were not aligned with fractures as shown in fig 5 and figure si 3d in the supporting information this signal drift was common where large transmissivity contrasts i e most often high t over low t were observed and is likely due to free convection occurring when more dense cooler water overlies less dense warmer water resulting in the vertical movement of water there were also instances where high angle fractures intersecting the borehole gave rise to two or more als responses along the length of the fracture in these cases the core informed otv allowed for the proper evaluation of these signals as evidence of a single active fracture 4 2 3 rock core voc concentrations near fractures a total of 408 rock core voc samples were analyzed covering 164 7 m of the hole voc sampling logs record the position of the samples relative to the observed fractures in the core the tce rock pore water concentrations ranged from non detects 9 10 5 μg g wet rock to a maximum of 2 3 μg g fig 4 tce was detected and quantified in 178 samples tce was detected but was not quantifiable in 187 samples and tce was not detected in 43 samples method detection and reporting limits vary slightly for each sample due to slight variability in wet rock sample mass per unit volume of methanol used for preservation and extraction in each vial in fig 4 samples with concentrations below the method detection limit mdl are shown as crosses and values above the method reporting limit mrl are plotted as solid circles non quantifiable data points are plotted as open circles tce was detected from the top of the water table to the bottom of the borehole and is generally related to the variation of transmissivity in the hole concentrations are highest in zones with high permeability e g 85 m bgs and 160 m bgs while low permeable zones or areas with no fractures are dominated by concentrations below the reporting limit e g 50 to 60 m bgs the tce profile shows several instances of diffusion halos emanating from individual fractures which is an excellent indication of active and continuous groundwater flow fig 4 tce detections often aligned with signs of flow from the als data fig 6 a d overall tce detections were associated with 97 of the active fractures selected from the core informed otv log 91 were quantifiable and 6 were detected but not quantifiable multiple tce detections were often attributed to a single flowing fracture when multiple samples were taken within the diffusion halo however due to the age of the contaminant plumes at this site it is possible for tce to have been flushed from the fractures and therefore the absence of contamination does not necessarily mean a fracture does not transmit flow especially in zones with significant permeability or deeper below the groundwater surface where contaminant concentrations would be attenuated with distance from the releases at the ground surface this was confirmed by the clear presence of back diffusion halos e g chapman and parker 2005 where tce concentration increased in the matrix away from the fracture such as at 105 2 m bgs fig 6d 4 2 4 selection of active fractures the strongest signs of flow from the four independent datasets include t values als temperature deviations aligned with fractures and quantifiable voc detections associated with fractures weaker signs of flow include misaligned als signals and non quantifiable voc detections the core descriptions could not be included as a strong indicator of flow initially because it was not evident which of the recorded descriptions were consistent signs of flow therefore the strength of the visual descriptions of fractures in the core log was assessed based on the frequency in which they were supported by other strong flow indicators in zones where other data were available table 2 bedding parallel fractures defined using otv data were also included in this assessment oxidation both on surface and diffused mineralization and smooth fractures have a high conditional probability 10 that they are supported by at least two independent strong flow indicators and were therefore considered strong indicators of flow the correlation between bedding parallel fractures and two or more strong signs of flow was inconsistent conditional probability of 1 2 and was therefore considered a weak indicator a total of 99 fractures were classified as active based on the multiple datasets table 3 summarizes how many independent strong signs of flow are associated with the active fractures selected twelve fractures were selected that were associated with strong flow evidence from all four independent data sets resulting in the highest level of confidence possible from these data sets eighty five fractures were selected that were associated with strong evidence of flow from three independent data sets only two fractures were selected with two types of strong flow evidence in both cases the fractures needed to be selected because there was measurable t in the zone and other fractures with a higher amount of evidence were not present in the zone in the first instance 70 94 mbgs the fracture was selected because it was the only fracture present in a packer zone with a measurable t value 1 4 10 6 m2 s and it had a quantifiable voc detection this fracture was also supported by a misaligned als signal that we have high confidence is related to this fracture because there are no other fractures in this portion of the hole in the second instance two fractures existed in the tested zone 1 6 10 6 m2 s but the fracture at 141 69 m bgs was selected because it appeared smooth was closest to a misaligned als signal and had a voc j detection the approach and data used in this study identified 99 active fractures over the 161 5 m of borehole analyzed resulting in an average active fracture spacing of 1 63 m and an average active fracture frequency of 0 61 fractures m 98 percent of the active fractures were confirmed with 3 or more independent lines of evidence example zones where multiple lines of evidence are used are illustrated in fig 6 with three examples of fracture and data alignments for active fractures that have strong flow evidence from at least 3 independent data sets fig 6a is an example of an active fracture at 68 m bgs selected from 4 independent datasets including a straddle packer interval with a t value of 2 1 10 5 m2 s a core description of bedding aligned a distinct cooling peak above the threshold for flow in the als dataset and a rock core voc sample taken at the fracture face with a tce concentration of 0 022 µg l fig 6b is another example of 2 active fractures at 106 4 and 107 4 m bgs selected from 3 independent datasets where two high angle fractures are aligned with separate als detections and were present in zones with t values of 2 4 10 6 m2 s and 2 1 10 6 m2 s respectively even though each fracture shows an als peak above the minimum response for fracture flow red line there are lesser signals on both sides of the peak that may be related to the effect of a high angle fracture on the als response tce was also detected at both fracture faces and into the surrounding matrix suggesting diffusion from the fracture into the matrix fig 6c shows an example of a highly fractured zone from 162 4 to 163 5 m bgs six continuous orange and one minor open grey fractures were selected based on their alignment to an als signal above the threshold tce detections across all fractures and significant transmissivity in the zone the use of multiple lines of evidence for hydraulically active fractures shows that 40 of those features logged as features with the traditional data sets core and otv atv logs are active and connected sufficiently to contribute to transport in groundwater at the plume scale ninety nine active fractures identified over the 166 m saturated length of the borehole produces an average frequency of 0 59 fractures m average spacing of 1 7 fractures m but were highly variable with a higher frequency of fractures in finer grained siltstone shale and laminated sandstones fig 7 it is noteworthy that there are four highly competent zones in the borehole where no fractures were observed over continuous lengths of 4 1 m 4 5 m 4 8 m and 6 7 m the borehole was divided into mechanical units using the cumulative fracture frequency method described by la pointe 2010 which uses changes in fracture frequency in cumulative fracture intensity plots p10 to identify mechanical layer boundaries the cumulative active fracture intensity plot for the study core hole presented in fig 7 shows the distribution of active fractures with depth and displays reasonably clear indications of changes in the fracture frequency by changes in the slope a total of 10 mechanical layers were identified with active fracture frequencies ranging from 0 fractures m to 2 69 fractures m table 4 fractures below the 10th layer were not included because they may only represent a partial layer the mechanical layer boundaries typically coincide with zones where no fractures were observed in the otv log however in two cases at 58 and 136 m bgs there is misalignment because the informed fractures were identified as inactive from the multiple datasets this is a unique aspect of using the active fracture distribution for the p10 and mechanical layer delineations as it depicts the boundaries determined from the active interconnected fractures rather than all the visible fractures produced using core or borehole imaging logs and may be a more realistic distribution of layer boundaries for hydrogeologic purposes this analysis also quantifies the variability of the active fracture density with depth providing a means for informing the vertical anisotropy that influences the flow and transport processes at the site 4 2 5 fracture orientation and selection bias the commercial software package fracman golder 2021 was used to identify and assign each of the core informed otv fractures to one of the site s three dominant fracture sets a beddingparallel set a northeast southwest nesw striking set and a northwest southeast nwse striking set identified by outcrop analysis completed by cilona 2016 the results of the analysis are presented using a rose diagram of fracture dip direction for the bedding set fig 8 a and fracture strike for the nesw and nwse sets fig 8b fifty one percent 51 of the sampled fractures were classified as bedding parallel with a total count of 120 fig 8c and a dominant dip direction between 300 and 320 the remaining 116 fractures were classified into one of the two sub vertical joint sets these fractures are oriented roughly perpendicular to the bedding and share a mean dip of 55 fig 8b shows the dominant strike is 10 to 20 for the nesw set and 300 to 310 for the nwse set with relative intensities of 26 and 23 respectively the relative intensity of each fracture set after the selection of active fractures remains relatively consistent fig 8c with the nesw set increasing by 4 to 30 the nwse set decreasing by 4 to 19 and the bedding set remaining unchanged at 51 of the total active fractures the dominant dip direction and strike change slightly after the active fracture selection with the bedding set becoming dominated by fractures in the 310 to 320 range with the nwse set seeing the most active fractures in this range the distribution of strike directions for active fractures in the nesw set remains the same it is important to recognize that the use of a single vertical borehole for this investigation produces a sample that is biased to contain a lower number of fractures than the actual amount this bias arises because the probability of a borehole intersecting any given fracture decreases as the fracture s dip angle approaches the borehole angle in the case of a vertical borehole the more vertical a fracture is the lower the probability of intersection the terzaghi method terzaghi 1965 was used to produce a more accurate estimate of the true fracture distribution by applying a geometric correction factor based on the angle between the borehole and the normal to each fracture the terzaghi corrected frequency for each fracture set was generated using the fracman software a comparison of the uncorrected and corrected fracture frequencies shows that all three sets were under sampled with the bedding set corrected frequency increasing by a factor of 1 2 the nesw by 2 9 and the nwse set by 2 7 fig 9 a and 9b after the correction the nesw set becomes the dominant set with a fracture frequency of 0 95 fractures m followed by the bedding set with 0 81 fractures m while the nwse has the smallest frequency of 0 65 fractures m the terzaghi corrected fracture frequency was also computed for each of the mechanical layers to produce a more realistic representation of the fracture variability with depth table 4 the average fracture frequency in the mechanical layers that contain fractures increase by factors ranging from 1 1 to 2 7 and is dependent on the number of sub vertical fractures in the layer the sampling bias has implications for the reported active fracture frequencies as it is likely that active fractures were also under sampled however to what degree is impossible to determine a possible method for correcting the active fracture frequency would be to apply the percentage of active fractures observed in a given mechanical unit to the respective corrected fracture frequency as is presented in table 4 when making assumptions regarding the number of missed active fractures it is important to note that the terzaghi method has limitations as it tends to overestimate fractures with orientations very close to that of the borehole axis golder 2021 4 2 6 rec fractures the critical reynolds number approach was used to estimate the number of fractures in seventeen 1 5 m zones where constant head step tests were conducted and the number of fractures determined in these zones based on the onset of non darcian flow ranged from 1 to 3 fractures fig 10 shows the two plots resulting from this method fig 10a compares the data from each zone where the rec is calculated from the largest darcian flow rate and the aperture is calculated assuming 1 fracture illustrating that the data does not fit the logarithmic curve whereas in 10b all of the zones fit the relationship well when the number of fractures is changed it should be noted that the hydraulic behavior observed in each zone is a blended response dominated by the largest fractures present as mentioned previously this fit is only possible by using a partial number of fractures that accounts for deviations from the cubic law such as excessive frictional losses aperture distributions within a single fracture or different fractures with different apertures in essence using a partial number of fractures in each zone to fit the curve indicates that the fractures in each zone are not the same size the partial number of fractures does not directly represent the number of fractures present rather it is an effective number of fractures tied to an average aperture assuming all fractures are the same size for example if a zone needs to use 1 8 fractures to fit the lab curve when each fractures has a different aperture the zone likely has 2 or more fractures of different sizes more work is needed to fully understand the methodology for allocating the rec partial number of fractures into multiple fractures with different apertures however it is reasonable to assume that this method is biased to the largest fractures in the test zone because these fractures will exhibit non linear behavior at low applied head based on the 17 test intervals on average 49 8 of the fractures identified from the otv log are participating in the hydraulic test and applying this percentage to all zones where a t was measured but a constant head step test was not conducted increases the size of the rec dataset for a better comparison with the multiple lines of evidence approach presented in this paper this comparison is presented in table s1 in the supporting information showing relatively good agreement between the two methods 4 3 hydraulic aperture estimates for active fractures when characterizing bedrock aquifer systems the fracture parameters needed to simulate transport are typically deduced from hydraulic tests using the measured t values and the cubic law to calculate hydraulic apertures but also depend on an estimate of the fractures present therefore identifying the number of active fractures will improve estimates of hydraulic aperture for groundwater flow and transport simulations chapman et al 2013 parker et al 2018 mclaren et al 2012 the hydraulic aperture distribution calculated using the t value from the packer tests with the 99 active fractures identified is presented in fig 11 these hydraulic apertures ranged from 44 µm to 713 µm with a geometric mean of 185 µm and an arithmetic mean of 232 µm these hydraulic apertures follow a log normal distribution consistent with other fractured sedimentary rock studies stone 1984 dverstorp and andersson 1989 dverstorp et al 1992 nordqvist et al 1992 it is important to note that the distribution of active fractures and the estimation of apertures are based on observations in a single corehole and is therefore only a one dimensional representation of the site conditions future work should be done to evaluate the distributions of active fractures within the sedimentological and structural geology aspects of the site including proximity to fault structures 5 key observations conclusions the methodology presented in this paper offers a multiple lines of evidence approach for determining the number and distribution of hydraulically active fractures in the studied borehole the workflow presented is based on a combination of conventional and newer high resolution borehole methods to synergistically use multiple measurements that are subject to specific bias or uncertainty including a core informed otv log t values from flute transmissivity profiling and straddle packer tests als temperature logging inside a lined borehole calibrated to represent flow through fractures and voc concentrations from high frequency rock core sampling the identification of active fractures is an important component of fractured rock characterization and provides input parameters on fracture frequency and apertures from field data at the resolution needed for flow and transport models that inform plume migration distances and fluxes using existing discrete fracture matrix dfm numerical models several dfm numerical models exist commercially but are rarely used by the hydrogeologic profession likely because the fracture network parameters for informing these models are difficult to obtain using conventional data sets this study shows that the multiple lines of evidence approach with emphasis on the use of hydraulic based methods is useful to differentiate the active fractures allowing improved estimation of hydraulic apertures the core informed otv log is a powerful tool that can be used with high resolution hydraulic methods such as als logging careful straddle packer testing as well as rock core contaminant analyses that target diffusion haloes adjacent to observed fractures to minimize inherent biases by assessing agreement between methods when identifying active fractures finally the critical reynolds number approach based on the onset of nonlinear flow showed good agreement with the number of active fractures identified throughout the 160 m long borehole since the rec approach is dominated by the largest fractures present it is expected that the active fractures selected can be greater than the number of rec fractures when there are multiple smaller fractures present in the test zone these multiple data sets are collected in bedrock investigations but typically are not used to deduce fracture network parameters the variable nature of the fracture networks and distinguishing which fractures are important for groundwater flow and transport i e are hydraulically connected is one of the most challenging aspects of fractured rock hydrogeology dershowitz 2014 berkowitz 2002 and neuman 2005 and as we show in this study this effort will benefit from higher resolution characterization techniques and multiple hydraulically informed data types to provide sufficient lines of evidence to inform site conceptual site models credit authorship contribution statement k

2173,climate change impacts on river flows are leading to substantial changes in water availability for human and natural systems the significance of these impacts largely depends on the degree of change relative to natural variability the time of emergence toe is the point in time past or future when the signal of climate change emerges from the noise of background variability the toe has been assessed for some climate variables but rarely streamflows here we investigate toe of changes in streamflow across australia for various characteristic periods relevant to different water management objectives we assess the uncertainty in toe estimates from different emissions pathways and a large ensemble of cmip6 climate model projections toe is likely to occur earlier in hydrologic systems subject to low natural variability than those subject to high variability and to systems that are vulnerable to failure over longer rather than shorter periods there are clear regional differences in the patterns of toe with changes first emerging in south west regions of australia followed by the south east then east and north we estimate that toe has already occurred in over 10 of sampled rivers for longer characteristic periods primarily in south west australia importantly for planning the results show that toe in flows precedes toe in precipitation by up to 50 years due to compounding effects of changes in annual precipitation precipitation seasonality and increasing temperatures the number of catchments projected to have reached toe by 2080 is heavily influenced by the trajectory of future emissions a low emissions pathway generally consistent with aspirational goals of the paris climate agreement ssp1 2 6 substantially delays the emergence of significant hydrological change by up to 50 years or negates emergence entirely by 2080 depending on location our methods can be applied to catchments globally and our findings have implications for the prioritisation of climate adaptation efforts across different river systems and the urgency of continued action on climate change mitigation keywords time of emergence climate change impacts on rivers hydroclimate variability climate change adaptation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction although future changes in flow averages variability and seasonality due to climate change threaten water resources ipcc 2014 the significance of change depends on the inherent variability of the system nathan et al 2019 those with low inherent variability may only tolerate a smaller absolute change compared to those with higher variability because human or natural systems are adapted to existing variations wilby and murphy 2019 likewise the timing of when climate change becomes manifest compared to natural variability is also a function of both the absolute change and the natural variability this timing is called the time of emergence toe toe is usually identified as the time when the signal climate impact exceeds the noise existing or natural variability hawkins and sutton 2012 understanding regional toe has implications for the prioritisation and sequencing of adaptation efforts toe has been studied for various environmental variables such as averages and extremes in temperature precipitation and ocean regimes at global and regional scales hawkins and sutton 2012 king et al 2015 nguyen et al 2018 silvy et al 2020 however few studies have assessed toe for river flows despite the importance of rivers to biodiversity agriculture water security achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs and the large focus on water resources when assessing climate adaptation options bhaduri et al 2016 bierbaum et al 2013 olmstead 2014 different water management objectives are sensitive to changes in flow conditions over different periods horne et al 2019 nathan et al 2019 thus a key element of understanding toe in hydrological systems may be characterising how toe varies when assessed over periods of different duration for example the emergence of changes to the flow regime over a short period may be critical to short lived species of freshwater fish but may not be as important to longer lived riparian vegetation bond et al 2018 2008 colloff et al 2015 similarly changes over a sequence of two to five years may be enough to trigger short term water restrictions in regulated systems but changes over a much longer period say 20 years may affect the viability of long term water entitlements or longer lived fish species bond et al 2018 understanding how toe varies across different characteristic periods can help anticipate flow related sectoral impacts and prioritise climate adaptation responses in different river basins it is also uncertain whether the toe in river flow will lag or lead the toe in precipitation changes in river flow may be amplified or dampened by rising temperatures depending on the nature of precipitation changes alizadeh and babaei 2022 for example rising temperatures will increase evaporative demand which can exacerbate reductions in precipitation in drier climates or offset increases in precipitation in wetter climates milly et al 2005 however streamflow generally exhibits higher natural variability compared to precipitation and thus it requires a larger signal to distinguish from the background noise of natural variability chiew and mcmahon 1993 previous work has disagreed on how toe varies between flow and precipitation for example zhuan et al 2018 found that the toe of long term average flows lagged that of precipitation in china whereas leng et al 2016 found that significant changes in flows preceded those of precipitation at a seasonal timescale there is no clearly accepted method to undertake the required analyses to estimate toe previous toe studies for climate variables have used different methods including signal to noise ratios collins 2021 hawkins and sutton 2012 zhuan et al 2018 and statistical tests to differentiate between sample distributions king et al 2015 leng et al 2016 many existing signal to noise based approaches use an arbitrary ratio threshold to define toe in addition many approaches only assess changes in the first statistical moment of climate variables e g by comparing changes in the mean statistical test methods such as those using the kolmogorov smirnov test statistic can assess changes to the entire distribution of outputs however statistical significance can be an arbitrary indicator of the physical significance of changed future conditions assessments of toe that directly use climate model projections are also hampered by their limited ability to characterise the influence of aleatory uncertainty over a given simulation period alizadeh 2022 that is while projections from multiple models are readily accessible eyring et al 2016 taylor et al 2012 the number of ensemble members from each model to represent natural internal variability is limited the minimum number of runs in the core cmip5 and cmip6 experiments was three an alternate method is to use stochastic data generation to simulate multiple replicates of climate sequences to better understand future distributions of environmental variables e g peel et al 2015 noting that stochastic data generation is a common way of statistically downscaling climate model outputs wilks 2010 this study advances the estimation and understanding of toe for river flows through three areas the demonstration of a method using stochastic data to better represent the range of climate variability the dependence of toe on different characteristic periods relevant to diverse water management objectives and the differences in estimated toe between flow and precipitation the sequencing of toe between precipitation and flow is especially uncertain in australia as climate projections generally vary from wetting in the northern tropics to drying in the south west and south east grose et al 2020 although there is some disagreement between climate models in addition australia has some of the world s largest hydrologic variability mcmahon et al 2007 influenced by many drivers of natural climate variability khaledi et al 2022 we assess the uncertainty in toe based on a large ensemble of the most recent climate projections for a diverse range of catchments around australia and contrast toe predictions between precipitation and river flow the approach can be used to inform the timing scope and prioritisation of adaptation to climate change and is applicable to any natural system 2 methods our method for assessing toe uses stochastic data generation and conceptual hydrological modelling to characterise natural variability in climate and streamflow under baseline and future projected conditions the method is applied to catchments that span the diversity of australian hydro climatology the components of our methodology summarised in fig 1 are based on comparing the distributions of stochastic results derived for a stationary baseline and non stationary climate projection to identify toe each of these components are further explained below 2 1 study area and catchment characteristics we assessed toe for 213 catchments with long data records and minimal anthropogenic influence across australia historic data are sourced from the freely available camels aus dataset fowler et al 2021 based on the hydrologic reference stations of australia s bureau of meteorology turner et al 2012 camels aus provides numerous data options and this study uses the same options as john et al 2021 following john et al 2021 very large greater than10 000 km2 camels aus catchments are omitted leaving a sample of 213 these catchments include the wide range of hydroclimatology found across australia but are more prevalent in the densely populated south east region fig 2 because the arid interior is sparsely gauged catchments have been grouped into geographical zones that represent boundaries of approximate hydroclimatic similarity and which also align with regional differences in climate change projections across australia fig 3 in general climate projections show drying climates in the south east severe drying is projected in the south west and increasing rainfall in the north and north west although there are clear patterns in the multi model ensemble mean projections for australia projections are also quite uncertain stippling in fig 3 demonstrates areas where less than 80 of climate models agree on the sign of the change however as noted by power et al 2012 this threshold when used in previous ipcc reporting for an ensemble of 24 models actually corresponds to a very high statistical significance level well above 99 in terms of the likelihood of model agreement based on a binomial distribution 2 2 stochastic data generation we used the stochastic data generation framework from fowler et al 2022a to generate multiple time series with similar statistical characteristic as the baseline for each catchment this method is particularly suited to australian climatic conditions that are subject to low and high frequency components of wet and dry periods of precipitation e g kiem and franks 2004 baseline conditions are characterised by generating 100 replicates of monthly precipitation and temperature based on the stationary statistical characteristics obtained from the observational records for each catchment the fowler et al 2022a framework uses a separate stochastic scheme to explicitly represent high and low frequency components that are identified using complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise colominas et al 2014 torres et al 2011 the high frequency components are represented using a lag one multi site model matalas 1967 and the low frequency component is identified using a broken line process mejia et al 1972 observed records from 1945 to 2018 were used to parameterise the stochastic data generation for the baseline period but the mean outputs of each replicate were adjusted to match those from 1945 to 1984 to maximise compatibility with the climate change factors detailed below an earlier baseline was chosen since there has already been substantial temperature increases in the later 20th and earlier 21st centuries and we wanted to examine whether projected climate changes may have already caused toe in some catchments the fowler et al 2022a framework identifies the stationary component of a timeseries by disregarding the final residual after removal of all intrinsic mode functions and this enabled us to remove any trend in the historical period that may be associated with climate change future conditions are represented by first generating 100 stochastic replicates these replicates are then post processed to represent the longer term climate changes over the period 1945 to 2100 as informed by climate model projections detailed below these stochastic climate projections are then input into rainfall runoff models to produce river flows the wapaba monthly timestep rainfall runoff model wang et al 2011 was chosen for this because it previously provided good performance in simulating runoff across australia john et al 2021 models were calibrated using an objective function that balances performance in wet and dry periods fowler et al 2016 further details of the calibration procedure and performance are available in john et al 2021 2 3 climate change projections climate impacts are simulated using an ensemble of 37 cmip6 models eyring et al 2016 and three shared socio economic pathways ssps of ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp5 8 5 o neill et al 2014 these pathways represent three plausible representations of future climate based on global development assumptions where ssp1 represents sustainable policy ssp2 is a middle of the road scenario and ssp5 represents fossil fuel dependent development meinshausen et al 2020 broadly speaking ssp2 4 5 represents an emissions pathway matching existing climate mitigation commitments nationally determined contributions for 2030 meinshausen et al 2022 ssp1 2 6 generally reflects a pathway consistent with the aspirational goals of the paris climate agreement of limiting temperature increases to 1 5 c meinshausen et al 2022 ou et al 2021 ssp5 8 5 represents a very high level of continued greenhouse gas emissions with minimal mitigation efforts further details of the climate model ensemble including horizontal grid resolution are provided in supplementary materials table s1 for each climate model and emissions scenario stochastic climate projections are simulated by applying change factors in annual precipitation mean temperature and precipitation seasonality to stochastically generated data see example in fig 4 climate model outputs were regridded to a consistent 1 875 by 1 25 latitude longitude spatial extent using linear interpolation see fig 3 for indicative grid layout raw monthly climate model projections are first derived using area weighted climate model grid cell outputs for each catchment these are then bias corrected using a quantile quantile matching technique to observed data over the period 1945 1985 johnson and sharma 2011 change factors through time are calculated by comparing a sliding window of 40 years relative to the 40 year baseline from 1945 to 1984 annual precipitation change factors are a multiplicative factor of precipitation in the 40 year sliding window relative to the baseline temperature change factors are an addition to the baseline period seasonality changes can be different for each catchment but are parameterised following fowler et al 2022 using a redistribution of precipitation away from the catchment specific wet season to a dry season the wet season is determined from the average wettest 6 month period in observational records positive seasonality changes reflect a redistribution of precipitation from the wet season to the dry season and vice versa note that total annual precipitation is preserved in this scheme as this is separately dealt with in the annual precipitation change factors finally the calculated change factors are smoothed using a locally weighted regression lowess this is included to reduce the presence of residual inter annual low frequency variability which is analysed and generated separately in the stochastic data scheme we note that because of the use of monthly stochastic data and hydrological models this method does not allow for changes in daily precipitation distributions all change factors are applied at an annual timescale i e all temperature shifts applied to stochastic data will be the same magnitude in a given year 2 4 identifying time of emergence the definition of toe is somewhat subjective as evidenced by the large range of definitions and alternate methods in existing literature we formulate two different definitions of toe as illustrated in fig 5 both definitions are based on a comparison of empirical distributions as follows 1 the time when the influence of climate change exceeds the influence of natural climate variability this relates to when the signal climate change exceeds the noise natural climate variability and 2 the time when the range of future outcomes lies wholly outside the range experienced under baseline conditions this relates to when climate change has produced a totally novel regime these two points in time are calculated using a simple approach that compares the empirical distributions of outcomes from stochastic data nathan et al 2019 we use the fractional geometric area shared between empirical distributions of baseline and future conditions as a summary metric these conditions could be any metric but in our study focusses on precipitation or flow assessed over various characteristic periods see below the fractional area that is not shared between the two distributions represents the fractional influence of climate change relative to climate variability on the total variation in outputs therefore 0 5 represents the point at which the influence of climate change exceeds the influence of natural climate variability hence the first definition of toe above and a fraction of 1 means a completely novel distribution of flows compared to the baseline hence the second definition fig 5 demonstrates both the approach and the respective quantities that accompany our definitions above this approach offers benefits in comparing the entire distribution of outputs rather than a limited number of statistical moments toe is estimated at the year in which the toe metric 0 5 or 1 occurs and persists below the threshold for the remainder of the projection we calculated toe separately for each climate projection combination of climate model projection and emissions scenario this allows an assessment of the uncertainty in toe based on the uncertainty of the modelled climate response to a given emissions scenario uncertainty ranges are assessed using the median 10th and 90th percentile toe from the ensemble of the 37 climate models 2 5 characteristic periods for river management we assessed toe for mean flow calculated using several different characteristic periods relevant to diverse river management objectives these characteristic periods can also be thought of as the period over which a system may be vulnerable to failure due to a single or compound set of events nathan et al 2019 to this end we chose 1 5 and 20 years which we refer to qualitatively as short medium and long as characteristic periods that are relevant to system performance of many natural and engineered systems we calculated the moving mean of annual flow in each stochastic projection as a summary metric for these periods metrics calculated over shorter hydroclimatic sequences are inherently more variable than those calculated over longer sequences as sampling variability typically decreases with sample size this suggests that a larger climate induced change may be required for shorter sequences before the signal becomes dominant this effect is exacerbated by multi year cycles of climate variability for example a three year hydroclimate sequence could be entirely within the high part of the cycle or vice versa using multiple replicates of stochastic data can help overcome this issue 3 results we first show the number of catchments reaching toe for the three emissions scenarios and characteristic periods we then show how toe contrasts between precipitation and flow and how the results vary for the different australian regions 3 1 time of emergence for the annual flow regime we initially consider the first definition of toe where the influence of climate change on the distribution of outcomes exceeds the influence of natural climate variability the distribution of median toe across 37 climate model projections for all catchments across the emissions scenarios and flow sequence periods is shown in fig 6 there are substantial differences between the long moderate and short flow sequences when the characteristic period is shorter the number of catchments reaching toe reduces and toe is later when it does occur for the long flow sequence 20 year periods approximately 10 of catchments are expected to have already reached toe by 2020 regardless of emissions scenario more than two thirds of the catchments are projected to reach toe by 2080 for the longer flow sequence for ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 in these scenarios toe predominantly occurs around 2050 the emissions scenarios present starker differences for the medium length flow sequence 5 year periods where the number of catchments reaching toe is much smaller for ssp2 4 5 than for ssp5 8 5 toe most often occurs after 2060 for ssp5 8 5 although there are still many catchments with toe earlier than 2040 for all scenarios few catchments reach toe for the shortest flow sequence 1 year periods this is because the variability in a given sample of short sequences will be higher than for a sample of longer sequences ssp1 2 6 has a substantially reduced number of catchments reaching toe compared to ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 for shorter characteristic periods however the difference between emissions scenarios becomes less pronounced for longer periods at least for the 10th and 90th percentile estimates table 1 shows the uncertainty in toe from the ensemble of climate model projections this uncertainty is generally very large reflecting the high diversity of climate model projections for australia grose et al 2020 for example the most severe 10 of projections suggest that greater than 95 of catchments will reach toe by 2080 in longer flow sequences regardless of emissions scenario conversely the least severe 10 of projections suggest only 6 to 32 will reach toe depending on emissions scenario nonetheless toe is expected to occur for large numbers of australian catchments for longer 20 year and medium 5 year flow periods unless significant climate change mitigation is undertaken table 2 shows the same information as table 1 but for the second definition of toe where the future distribution is wholly unlike the baseline despite climate model and emissions scenario uncertainty no catchments reach this more stringent criterion for the 1 year sequence and far fewer catchments reach it for the longer 20 year and medium 5 year flow periods 3 2 spatial variation in time of emergence for precipitation and flow fig 7 shows how median toe varies between precipitation and flow for each catchment over time with regions denoted by marker style and colour toe in precipitation occurs less frequently than toe in flow in addition depending on the period over which toe is assessed and the adopted emissions scenario the lag between toe in flows and precipitation is up to 40 years and is greater in catchments in south east australia catchments with later toe in flows have an increased lag for toe in precipitation presumably due to the increasing influence of temperature rises and seasonality changes on flow toe through time this was more apparent for higher emissions scenarios with corresponding higher temperatures fig 7 also shows the distribution of toe for flows for each of the australian regions in the lower portion of each panel the majority of catchments where toe is predicted to have already occurred i e pre 2020 are in the south west region and to a lesser extent in the south east generally south west catchments reach toe first between 1990 and 2040 for long and medium flow sequence lengths regardless of emissions scenario this is followed by south east catchments predominantly mid century for the longer flow periods and in the latter half of the century for the medium flow period toe in flows for the north west north east and east regions generally only occurs for longer flow sequences and in the latter half of the century if at all intuitively the earlier toe in flows occurs the less impact differences in emissions scenarios have as scenarios further diverge as time goes on despite this earlier toe suggests catchments may be more sensitive to smaller climate changes 4 discussion the conclusion that toe in river flows has already occurred for a substantial number of australian catchments is supported by observations of significant flow reductions in south western australia since the 1970s petrone et al 2010 and is consistent with climate model projections of declines in precipitation silberstein et al 2012 these changes have had and will continue to have substantial impacts on water supply and freshwater ecosystems barron et al 2012 mcfarlane et al 2012 there are also some catchments in the south east of australia that are estimated to have already reached toe whilst there have been observations of longer term reductions in cool season rainfall in the south east dey et al 2019 assessing flow reductions is partly confounded by a very severe multi year drought that occurred around the turn of the millennium van dijk et al 2013 nonetheless these results suggest that continued flow changes and corresponding impacts are increasingly likely in south eastern australia and thus this may be the dominant area for flow related climate adaptation efforts in the medium term there are large differences in projections of toe and hence the significance of climate change impacts for alternate emissions scenarios ssp1 2 6 significantly reduced the number of catchments reaching toe compared to other scenarios given ssp2 4 5 is somewhat similar to existing 2030 global commitments for emissions reductions meinshausen et al 2022 fully implementing the aspirational goals of the paris climate agreement which are more closely aligned with ssp1 2 6 could substantially decrease the significance of climate change impacts on australian rivers the uncertainty in toe from the different emissions scenarios is eclipsed by the uncertainty in regional climate projections from the cmip6 ensemble as evidenced by the wide bounds for a given emission scenario table 1 there are additional uncertainties in toe that have not been explored here these include the effect of using different hydrological models to project changes in flow although this is generally of lesser importance than uncertainty in climate model responses teng et al 2012 except in extreme cases where hydrological response may amplify precipitation reductions to an exceptional degree fowler et al 2022b in addition the use of monthly data and models in this work precludes assessing the influence of finer timescale changes in climate such as changes in short duration precipitation events intensification in short duration precipitation is widely expected to occur globally h j fowler et al 2021 in australia however for all but larger floods this will likely be offset by changes in soil moisture regimes wasko and nathan 2019 overall despite this uncertainty this work shows there is only a small likelihood that australian flow conditions in the future will lie wholly outside of the range of baseline conditions following the second definition of toe this may not hold in other locations around the world with low existing hydrologic variability or strong projected climate change impacts if these conditions did eventuate they would likely be accompanied by extremely severe consequences for all aspects of water management these results have global significance for rivers since australian rivers typically feature high natural variability many other locations around the world with lower hydrologic variability may experience earlier toe in river flows in addition there is large uncertainty in future regional precipitation change across australia for which there is limited consensus in even the sign of the change other regions worldwide such as the southern mediterranean western united states or india show a clearer precipitation signal in climate model projections eyring et al 2021 these regions may experience earlier toe due to the stronger projected climate change signal given the sensitivity of flows to changes in multiple climate variables we do not recommend using estimated toe for precipitation to qualitatively describe impacts on water resources the comparison of toe in flow and precipitation yielded two general insights the first is that toe in precipitation occurs less frequently than toe in flow this is because change in flows can be amplified by changes in seasonality and increased temperatures in drying climates these amplifications can lead to non linear and non additive responses in river outcomes john et al 2022 the second is that toe in precipitation where it occurs frequently lags toe in flows despite the generally higher variability of australian streamflow mcmahon et al 2007 this is related to the first outcome due to the interactive effects of multiple climate changes on streamflow but can also be related to the degree of natural variability between precipitation and flow and non linearity in the rainfall runoff relationship in regions around the world with projected increases in precipitation toe in flows may be delayed due to a combination of wetting and drying effects increases in precipitation vs increases in temperature and evaporation 5 conclusion significant changes in the flow regime of australian rivers are likely to occur by 2080 for some regions flow regimes where the influence of climate change exceeds the influence of natural climate variability are projected to have already emerged this is supported by observations of significant flow declines and changes in precipitation patterns further changes may emerge in south east australia and thus be a high priority for adaptation efforts toe is more likely to occur for metrics calculated over longer flow sequences thus impacts may be more significant for management objectives and river ecology that are sensitive to such timescales we note that this work only considers toe at an annual timescale and for metrics summarised using the mean across different characteristic periods other flow metrics such as seasonal changes or changes in extremes may also be relevant to diverse river management objectives around the world nonetheless our method and results form a useful basis to compare patterns of regional toe estimates and form general conclusions these methods can be easily applied to many parts of the world with sufficient data records to assist in providing an increased understanding of the significance of climate change impacts on rivers even though the uncertainty in estimates of toe can be very large owing to uncertainty in climate model projections strong action on climate mitigation will limit the risk of further changes and reduce the severity of impacts on rivers

2173,climate change impacts on river flows are leading to substantial changes in water availability for human and natural systems the significance of these impacts largely depends on the degree of change relative to natural variability the time of emergence toe is the point in time past or future when the signal of climate change emerges from the noise of background variability the toe has been assessed for some climate variables but rarely streamflows here we investigate toe of changes in streamflow across australia for various characteristic periods relevant to different water management objectives we assess the uncertainty in toe estimates from different emissions pathways and a large ensemble of cmip6 climate model projections toe is likely to occur earlier in hydrologic systems subject to low natural variability than those subject to high variability and to systems that are vulnerable to failure over longer rather than shorter periods there are clear regional differences in the patterns of toe with changes first emerging in south west regions of australia followed by the south east then east and north we estimate that toe has already occurred in over 10 of sampled rivers for longer characteristic periods primarily in south west australia importantly for planning the results show that toe in flows precedes toe in precipitation by up to 50 years due to compounding effects of changes in annual precipitation precipitation seasonality and increasing temperatures the number of catchments projected to have reached toe by 2080 is heavily influenced by the trajectory of future emissions a low emissions pathway generally consistent with aspirational goals of the paris climate agreement ssp1 2 6 substantially delays the emergence of significant hydrological change by up to 50 years or negates emergence entirely by 2080 depending on location our methods can be applied to catchments globally and our findings have implications for the prioritisation of climate adaptation efforts across different river systems and the urgency of continued action on climate change mitigation keywords time of emergence climate change impacts on rivers hydroclimate variability climate change adaptation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction although future changes in flow averages variability and seasonality due to climate change threaten water resources ipcc 2014 the significance of change depends on the inherent variability of the system nathan et al 2019 those with low inherent variability may only tolerate a smaller absolute change compared to those with higher variability because human or natural systems are adapted to existing variations wilby and murphy 2019 likewise the timing of when climate change becomes manifest compared to natural variability is also a function of both the absolute change and the natural variability this timing is called the time of emergence toe toe is usually identified as the time when the signal climate impact exceeds the noise existing or natural variability hawkins and sutton 2012 understanding regional toe has implications for the prioritisation and sequencing of adaptation efforts toe has been studied for various environmental variables such as averages and extremes in temperature precipitation and ocean regimes at global and regional scales hawkins and sutton 2012 king et al 2015 nguyen et al 2018 silvy et al 2020 however few studies have assessed toe for river flows despite the importance of rivers to biodiversity agriculture water security achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs and the large focus on water resources when assessing climate adaptation options bhaduri et al 2016 bierbaum et al 2013 olmstead 2014 different water management objectives are sensitive to changes in flow conditions over different periods horne et al 2019 nathan et al 2019 thus a key element of understanding toe in hydrological systems may be characterising how toe varies when assessed over periods of different duration for example the emergence of changes to the flow regime over a short period may be critical to short lived species of freshwater fish but may not be as important to longer lived riparian vegetation bond et al 2018 2008 colloff et al 2015 similarly changes over a sequence of two to five years may be enough to trigger short term water restrictions in regulated systems but changes over a much longer period say 20 years may affect the viability of long term water entitlements or longer lived fish species bond et al 2018 understanding how toe varies across different characteristic periods can help anticipate flow related sectoral impacts and prioritise climate adaptation responses in different river basins it is also uncertain whether the toe in river flow will lag or lead the toe in precipitation changes in river flow may be amplified or dampened by rising temperatures depending on the nature of precipitation changes alizadeh and babaei 2022 for example rising temperatures will increase evaporative demand which can exacerbate reductions in precipitation in drier climates or offset increases in precipitation in wetter climates milly et al 2005 however streamflow generally exhibits higher natural variability compared to precipitation and thus it requires a larger signal to distinguish from the background noise of natural variability chiew and mcmahon 1993 previous work has disagreed on how toe varies between flow and precipitation for example zhuan et al 2018 found that the toe of long term average flows lagged that of precipitation in china whereas leng et al 2016 found that significant changes in flows preceded those of precipitation at a seasonal timescale there is no clearly accepted method to undertake the required analyses to estimate toe previous toe studies for climate variables have used different methods including signal to noise ratios collins 2021 hawkins and sutton 2012 zhuan et al 2018 and statistical tests to differentiate between sample distributions king et al 2015 leng et al 2016 many existing signal to noise based approaches use an arbitrary ratio threshold to define toe in addition many approaches only assess changes in the first statistical moment of climate variables e g by comparing changes in the mean statistical test methods such as those using the kolmogorov smirnov test statistic can assess changes to the entire distribution of outputs however statistical significance can be an arbitrary indicator of the physical significance of changed future conditions assessments of toe that directly use climate model projections are also hampered by their limited ability to characterise the influence of aleatory uncertainty over a given simulation period alizadeh 2022 that is while projections from multiple models are readily accessible eyring et al 2016 taylor et al 2012 the number of ensemble members from each model to represent natural internal variability is limited the minimum number of runs in the core cmip5 and cmip6 experiments was three an alternate method is to use stochastic data generation to simulate multiple replicates of climate sequences to better understand future distributions of environmental variables e g peel et al 2015 noting that stochastic data generation is a common way of statistically downscaling climate model outputs wilks 2010 this study advances the estimation and understanding of toe for river flows through three areas the demonstration of a method using stochastic data to better represent the range of climate variability the dependence of toe on different characteristic periods relevant to diverse water management objectives and the differences in estimated toe between flow and precipitation the sequencing of toe between precipitation and flow is especially uncertain in australia as climate projections generally vary from wetting in the northern tropics to drying in the south west and south east grose et al 2020 although there is some disagreement between climate models in addition australia has some of the world s largest hydrologic variability mcmahon et al 2007 influenced by many drivers of natural climate variability khaledi et al 2022 we assess the uncertainty in toe based on a large ensemble of the most recent climate projections for a diverse range of catchments around australia and contrast toe predictions between precipitation and river flow the approach can be used to inform the timing scope and prioritisation of adaptation to climate change and is applicable to any natural system 2 methods our method for assessing toe uses stochastic data generation and conceptual hydrological modelling to characterise natural variability in climate and streamflow under baseline and future projected conditions the method is applied to catchments that span the diversity of australian hydro climatology the components of our methodology summarised in fig 1 are based on comparing the distributions of stochastic results derived for a stationary baseline and non stationary climate projection to identify toe each of these components are further explained below 2 1 study area and catchment characteristics we assessed toe for 213 catchments with long data records and minimal anthropogenic influence across australia historic data are sourced from the freely available camels aus dataset fowler et al 2021 based on the hydrologic reference stations of australia s bureau of meteorology turner et al 2012 camels aus provides numerous data options and this study uses the same options as john et al 2021 following john et al 2021 very large greater than10 000 km2 camels aus catchments are omitted leaving a sample of 213 these catchments include the wide range of hydroclimatology found across australia but are more prevalent in the densely populated south east region fig 2 because the arid interior is sparsely gauged catchments have been grouped into geographical zones that represent boundaries of approximate hydroclimatic similarity and which also align with regional differences in climate change projections across australia fig 3 in general climate projections show drying climates in the south east severe drying is projected in the south west and increasing rainfall in the north and north west although there are clear patterns in the multi model ensemble mean projections for australia projections are also quite uncertain stippling in fig 3 demonstrates areas where less than 80 of climate models agree on the sign of the change however as noted by power et al 2012 this threshold when used in previous ipcc reporting for an ensemble of 24 models actually corresponds to a very high statistical significance level well above 99 in terms of the likelihood of model agreement based on a binomial distribution 2 2 stochastic data generation we used the stochastic data generation framework from fowler et al 2022a to generate multiple time series with similar statistical characteristic as the baseline for each catchment this method is particularly suited to australian climatic conditions that are subject to low and high frequency components of wet and dry periods of precipitation e g kiem and franks 2004 baseline conditions are characterised by generating 100 replicates of monthly precipitation and temperature based on the stationary statistical characteristics obtained from the observational records for each catchment the fowler et al 2022a framework uses a separate stochastic scheme to explicitly represent high and low frequency components that are identified using complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise colominas et al 2014 torres et al 2011 the high frequency components are represented using a lag one multi site model matalas 1967 and the low frequency component is identified using a broken line process mejia et al 1972 observed records from 1945 to 2018 were used to parameterise the stochastic data generation for the baseline period but the mean outputs of each replicate were adjusted to match those from 1945 to 1984 to maximise compatibility with the climate change factors detailed below an earlier baseline was chosen since there has already been substantial temperature increases in the later 20th and earlier 21st centuries and we wanted to examine whether projected climate changes may have already caused toe in some catchments the fowler et al 2022a framework identifies the stationary component of a timeseries by disregarding the final residual after removal of all intrinsic mode functions and this enabled us to remove any trend in the historical period that may be associated with climate change future conditions are represented by first generating 100 stochastic replicates these replicates are then post processed to represent the longer term climate changes over the period 1945 to 2100 as informed by climate model projections detailed below these stochastic climate projections are then input into rainfall runoff models to produce river flows the wapaba monthly timestep rainfall runoff model wang et al 2011 was chosen for this because it previously provided good performance in simulating runoff across australia john et al 2021 models were calibrated using an objective function that balances performance in wet and dry periods fowler et al 2016 further details of the calibration procedure and performance are available in john et al 2021 2 3 climate change projections climate impacts are simulated using an ensemble of 37 cmip6 models eyring et al 2016 and three shared socio economic pathways ssps of ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp5 8 5 o neill et al 2014 these pathways represent three plausible representations of future climate based on global development assumptions where ssp1 represents sustainable policy ssp2 is a middle of the road scenario and ssp5 represents fossil fuel dependent development meinshausen et al

climate model projections for australia grose et al 2020 for example the most severe 10 of projections suggest that greater than 95 of catchments will reach toe by 2080 in longer flow sequences regardless of emissions scenario conversely the least severe 10 of projections suggest only 6 to 32 will reach toe depending on emissions scenario nonetheless toe is expected to occur for large numbers of australian catchments for longer 20 year and medium 5 year flow periods unless significant climate change mitigation is undertaken table 2 shows the same information as table 1 but for the second definition of toe where the future distribution is wholly unlike the baseline despite climate model and emissions scenario uncertainty no catchments reach this more stringent criterion for the 1 year sequence and far fewer catchments reach it for the longer 20 year and medium 5 year flow periods 3 2 spatial variation in time of emergence for precipitation and flow fig 7 shows how median toe varies between precipitation and flow for each catchment over time with regions denoted by marker style and colour toe in precipitation occurs less frequently than toe in flow in addition depending on the period over which toe is assessed and the adopted emissions scenario the lag between toe in flows and precipitation is up to 40 years and is greater in catchments in south east australia catchments with later toe in flows have an increased lag for toe in precipitation presumably due to the increasing influence of temperature rises and seasonality changes on flow toe through time this was more apparent for higher emissions scenarios with corresponding higher temperatures fig 7 also shows the distribution of toe for flows for each of the australian regions in the lower portion of each panel the majority of catchments where toe is predicted to have already occurred i e pre 2020 are in the south west region and to a lesser extent in the south east generally south west catchments reach toe first between 1990 and 2040 for long and medium flow sequence lengths regardless of emissions scenario this is followed by south east catchments predominantly mid century for the longer flow periods and in the latter half of the century for the medium flow period toe in flows for the north west north east and east regions generally only occurs for longer flow sequences and in the latter half of the century if at all intuitively the earlier toe in flows occurs the less impact differences in emissions scenarios have as scenarios further diverge as time goes on despite this earlier toe suggests catchments may be more sensitive to smaller climate changes 4 discussion the conclusion that toe in river flows has already occurred for a substantial number of australian catchments is supported by observations of significant flow reductions in south western australia since the 1970s petrone et al 2010 and is consistent with climate model projections of declines in precipitation silberstein et al 2012 these changes have had and will continue to have substantial impacts on water supply and freshwater ecosystems barron et al 2012 mcfarlane et al 2012 there are also some catchments in the south east of australia that are estimated to have already reached toe whilst there have been observations of longer term reductions in cool season rainfall in the south east dey et al 2019 assessing flow reductions is partly confounded by a very severe multi year drought that occurred around the turn of the millennium van dijk et al 2013 nonetheless these results suggest that continued flow changes and corresponding impacts are increasingly likely in south eastern australia and thus this may be the dominant area for flow related climate adaptation efforts in the medium term there are large differences in projections of toe and hence the significance of climate change impacts for alternate emissions scenarios ssp1 2 6 significantly reduced the number of catchments reaching toe compared to other scenarios given ssp2 4 5 is somewhat similar to existing 2030 global commitments for emissions reductions meinshausen et al 2022 fully implementing the aspirational goals of the paris climate agreement which are more closely aligned with ssp1 2 6 could substantially decrease the significance of climate change impacts on australian rivers the uncertainty in toe from the different emissions scenarios is eclipsed by the uncertainty in regional climate projections from the cmip6 ensemble as evidenced by the wide bounds for a given emission scenario table 1 there are additional uncertainties in toe that have not been explored here these include the effect of using different hydrological models to project changes in flow although this is generally of lesser importance than uncertainty in climate model responses teng et al 2012 except in extreme cases where hydrological response may amplify precipitation reductions to an exceptional degree fowler et al 2022b in addition the use of monthly data and models in this work precludes assessing the influence of finer timescale changes in climate such as changes in short duration precipitation events intensification in short duration precipitation is widely expected to occur globally h j fowler et al 2021 in australia however for all but larger floods this will likely be offset by changes in soil moisture regimes wasko and nathan 2019 overall despite this uncertainty this work shows there is only a small likelihood that australian flow conditions in the future will lie wholly outside of the range of baseline conditions following the second definition of toe this may not hold in other locations around the world with low existing hydrologic variability or strong projected climate change impacts if these conditions did eventuate they would likely be accompanied by extremely severe consequences for all aspects of water management these results have global significance for rivers since australian rivers typically feature high natural variability many other locations around the world with lower hydrologic variability may experience earlier toe in river flows in addition there is large uncertainty in future regional precipitation change across australia for which there is limited consensus in even the sign of the change other regions worldwide such as the southern mediterranean western united states or india show a clearer precipitation signal in climate model projections eyring et al 2021 these regions may experience earlier toe due to the stronger projected climate change signal given the sensitivity of flows to changes in multiple climate variables we do not recommend using estimated toe for precipitation to qualitatively describe impacts on water resources the comparison of toe in flow and precipitation yielded two general insights the first is that toe in precipitation occurs less frequently than toe in flow this is because change in flows can be amplified by changes in seasonality and increased temperatures in drying climates these amplifications can lead to non linear and non additive responses in river outcomes john et al 2022 the second is that toe in precipitation where it occurs frequently lags toe in flows despite the generally higher variability of australian streamflow mcmahon et al 2007 this is related to the first outcome due to the interactive effects of multiple climate changes on streamflow but can also be related to the degree of natural variability between precipitation and flow and non linearity in the rainfall runoff relationship in regions around the world with projected increases in precipitation toe in flows may be delayed due to a combination of wetting and drying effects increases in precipitation vs increases in temperature and evaporation 5 conclusion significant changes in the flow regime of australian rivers are likely to occur by 2080 for some regions flow regimes where the influence of climate change exceeds the influence of natural climate variability are projected to have already emerged this is supported by observations of significant flow declines and changes in precipitation patterns further changes may emerge in south east australia and thus be a high priority for adaptation efforts toe is more likely to occur for metrics calculated over longer flow sequences thus impacts may be more significant for management objectives and river ecology that are sensitive to such timescales we note that this work only considers toe at an annual timescale and for metrics summarised using the mean across different characteristic periods other flow metrics such as seasonal changes or changes in extremes may also be relevant to diverse river management objectives around the world nonetheless our method and results form a useful basis to compare patterns of regional toe estimates and form general conclusions these methods can be easily applied to many parts of the world with sufficient data records to assist in providing an increased understanding of the significance of climate change impacts on rivers even though the uncertainty in estimates of toe can be very large owing to uncertainty in climate model projections strong action on climate mitigation will limit the risk of further changes and reduce the severity of impacts on rivers

2174,geothermal fluid is considered to be one of the important methods of earthquake forecasting and some achievements have been made in previous studies however there is still a lot of work to be done before geothermal fluid can actually be used for earthquake forecasting lijiang xiaojinhe fault lxf which is a quake prone region that lies on the border of tibetan plateau and yangtze block is a good natural experimental field for earthquake research in this contribution we performed a systematic hydrogeochemistry and isotopic analysis of the geothermal waters and gases in the lxf zone high cl 0 69 529 44 mg l concentrations in hot springs indicate that they are contaminated by deep fluid obviously further continuous observation 2020 2022 indicates that there are at least four times correspondence between ion concentration in two hot springs jinhe 94 and xiaoshuiping 331 two earthquakes ml 5 2 earthquake on january 02 2022 and ml 4 6 earthquake on april 16 2022 in ninglang are only 50 km away from 331 hot spring and obvious abnormal concentrations of cl na and so4 2 were observed before the earthquakes combined with geological background and previous studies we propose that lower crustal flow could be the reason why earthquake prone in lxf the lower crust flow through the lxf from northwest to southeast causes internal deformation of the lxf zone then a large amount of groundwater infiltrates deep underground along the fault strengthens the pore fluid pressure promotes the water rock reaction weakens fault zone and trigger earthquakes ion concentrations in hot springs are sensitive to seismic activity in lxf unusually high or low ion concentrations in hot springs could represent the process of earthquake development monitoring proper geothermal waters and gases in lxf will help us to study the pre seismic hydrochemical precursors and have a potential to provide important bases for earthquake forecasting keywords southeastern tibetan plateau geothermal fluid water rock reaction lijiang xiaojinhe fault hot spring lower crustal flow data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction earthquake is controlled by the intermittent energy liberation in the earth which is suddenly and destructively for example 5 12 wenchuan earthquake in china and 3 11 fukushima earthquake in japan for a long time the gestation and causative mechanism of earthquake is always a tough task in seismology geothermal water and gas geochemistry are two of the methods of seismic research earthquakes are usually accompanied by the release of large amounts of gases e g co2 boschetti et al 2022 chiodini et al 2011 famin et al 2008 miller et al 2004 an overwhelming quantity of gas accumulated in the deep to form high pressure gas reservoirs which may act as a trigger for aftershocks miller et al 2004 in addition the isotopic compositions of gas are sensitive to earthquake researches have shown that the region with higher helium isotopic composition given as r ra ra air 3he 4he 1 39 10 6 the stronger tectonic activity and more prone to earthquakes kennedy and van soest 2006 the chemical compositions of geothermal water can be affected by earthquake barbieri et al 2021 franchini et al 2021 king et al 2006 wang et al 2022 2023 previous studies show that significant cl anomaly was observed in the groundwater in both the kobe japan and the galicia spain before earthquake perez et al 2008 tsunogai and wakita 1995 the increase in cl concentration may reflect the intensification of deep tectonic activity other geochemical indices like δd δ18o δ11b na so4 2 pb etc were also observed anomalies when the earthquake occurred barbieri et al 2021 franchini et al 2021 li et al 2021 poitrasson et al 1999 skelton et al 2014 wang et al 2021 although previous researches have made some research achievements in using geothermal water and gas for earthquake forecasting there are still difficulties in dealing with short term or imminent earthquake forecasting due to long sample collection interval in addition geochemical indices are easily affected by changes in external temperature and pressure surrounding rock types and multi sources of fluid and or gas which make it difficult to identify anomalies of geochemical indices accurately therefore accurately identifying the origin circulation and water rock reaction process of geothermal water will help to improve the ability to identify geochemical anomalies in earthquakes and provide bases for earthquake forecasting the lijiang xiaojinhe fault lxf zone is enriched in geothermal resources at least a dozen of hot springs have been discovered in the area fig 1 meanwhile it is a quake prone region that lies on the border with tibetan plateau and yangtze block including more than 50 destructive earthquakes ml 5 0 and 12 earthquakes of magnitude 6 or above within 50 years li et al 2020 the largest earthquake ever recorded was the 1996 lijiang earthquake with a magnitude of 7 0 ding et al 2018 therefore lxf is a favorable area for geothermal and seismological research herein in order to explore how to accurately identify the geochemical anomalies during the gestation and occurrence of earthquakes we perform a detailed geochemical and isotopic analysis of geothermal waters and gases collected from the lxf zone to trace the source and migration mechanism of hot springs and explore the variation of geochemical indices of geothermal water in the process of tectonic activities this research is valuable for understanding the relationship between geothermal water and earthquake 2 geologic background the lxf is located in the southeastern margin of the tibetan plateau which is the boundary between the eurasian plate and the indian plate fig 1

extension of lmsf xu et al 2007 and controlled by sinistral shear stress of the xxf xiang et al 2002 lxf starts from jianchuan in the southwest and goes northeast through lijiang ninglang and muli then turns to nne and converging on xxf in shimian eventually fig 1 the length of lxf is over 300 km xiang et al 2002 and includes three belts the south inner and north belts the south belt from

ding et al 2018 igneous rocks are less exposed and mainly including basalts and granites fig 1 lxf zone is subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 13 20 and annual precipitation of 750 900 mm due to its location in the hengduan mountains in southwest china the climate in the territory is obviously vertically distributed with snow capped mountains and abundant

analytical methods 3 1 geothermal water samples collection and analysis a total of 22 samples of geothermal water were collected repeatedly from 14 site of hot spring and well along the lxf during 2013 to 2021 table 1 fig 1 about 50 ml of geothermal water samples were collected using a clean polyethylene bottle while the temperature and ph of the hot spring were recorded at least two bottles of water samples were collected at each sampling site one bottle was dripped with ultrapure hno3 for cation analysis and the other for anion and isotope analysis filtrating through 0 45 μm membrane was

by water displacement method detailed chemical procedure can be found in zhang et al 2021b in brief a glass bottle was connected to a funnel and filled with spring water to make sure no air bubbles inside it put them upside down in the spring allowing the accumulated bubbles entering into the bottle to displace spring water out disconnecting the funnel under water while stoppering the bottle

value and the external precision on the measured δ13cco2 values was better than 0 3 zhang et al 2021b 4 results 4 1 geothermal waters chemical and isotopic compositions geothermal waters chemical and isotopic compositions are listed in table 1 the temperature of waters varies from 12 7 to 57 4 c and the mean temperature of 22 hot spring samples is 31 c sample 280 12 7 c and 279 57 4 c have the lowest and highest temperatures respectively the ph values of samples varied from 6 57 to 9 76 which indicates neutral to alkaline conditions the samples have wide range of na 2 19 614 77 mg l ca2 5 63 273 92 mg l and mg2 1 82 85 26 mg l concentration anion is mainly hco3 120 94 1292 01 mg l the waters are ca mg hco3 and na cl types according to the piper diagram fig 2 significantly sample 70 170 and 331 have high cl 164 2 529 44 mg l and so4 2 54 45 627 02 mg l contents the high concentrations of cl in hot spring probably originated from the mixing with deep fluid pan et al 2021 the δ18o and δd of samples varied from 21 5 to 9 5 and 125 to 74 respectively which is near to the local meteoric water line lmwl of the lijiang δd 6 56 δ18o 2 96 r2 0 91 n 151 cao et al 2018 fig 3 suggesting their meteoric origin sample 70 170 and 331 present the higher cl contents and the lighter h and o isotopic compositions 4 2 geothermal gas samples chemical and isotopic compositions geothermal gas samples chemical and isotopic compositions are listed in table 2 major gas species of the samples are either co2 or n2 or both of them the r ra of gas samples range from 0 09ra to 0 42ra falling in the typical crustal value 0 01 0 05ra fig 4 sano and wakita 1985 helium contents range from 157 2 to 10938 ppm sample 331 presents the highest he contents and 4he 20ne value 1174 80 carbon isotope values of gaseous co2 in our samples range from 13 20 to 4 10 with a fractionation of 9 indicating that the co2 of gas samples could be multisource 5 discussion 5 1 origin of geothermal waters numerous studies have shown that almost all geothermal waters originated from recirculating meteoric waters which were mixed with a small amount of deep fluid or not hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes is one of method to identify the origin of spring water craig 1961 the δ18o and δd of geothermal waters of lxf varied from 21 5 to 9 5 and 125 to 74 respectively which is near to the lmwl of the lijiang δd 6 56 δ18o 2 96 r2 0 91 n 151 fig 3 cao et al 2018 suggesting their meteoric origin as is shown in fig 3 the δ18o value of a few geothermal waters deviated from the lmwl and inclined to higher indicating that the isotopic exchange of 18o with rock that came into contact with the water fig 3 the altitude effect means the change in the stable isotopic composition of precipitation with elevation li et al 2018 in the evaporation process of water light isotopes are preferentially enriched in the gas phase therefore the higher the altitude the more enriched the light isotope compositions craig 1961 the average altitude sampled of lxf zone were about 2200 m table 1 the correlation between oxygen isotopes and altitude in hengduan mountains has been studied by li et al 2018 which show that the δ18o and altitude of the hengduan mountains conformed to δ18o 0 0028 m 3 93 m is altitude li et al 2018 combining with the lmwl δd 6 56 δ18o 2 96 cao et al 2018 the δd and δ18o values of meteoric water in the region are estimated to 70 and 10 respectively it is comparable to the heaviest isotopic composition of the geothermal waters in this study table 1 there are snow capped mountains all year round in the area and the δd and δ18o of snow melt water are 184 and 27 respectively li et al 2018 most geothermal waters have lighter hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions than meteoric water in our samples especially water 70 shows the lowest δd 125 and δ18o 16 5 value table 1 light hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of waters suggesting the contamination of potentially snow water nevertheless the cl concentration of the snow mountain water is very low pan et al 2021 which is inconsistent with the fact that the high contents of cl 149 29 mg l in same waters like water 70 170 and 331 the high cl 164 2 529 44 mg l contents indicating other origins of geothermal waters in lxf zone where is the origin of cl in hot waters which will be discussed in detail next 5 2 origin of cl in geothermal water chloride minus is one of the important chemical indices in geothermal water and can be used to investigate the hydrogeochemical processes of geothermal waters and to constraint the origin of parent geothermal fluid pan et al 2021 truesdell et al 1989 wang et al 2018 studies have shown that there are three main origin of cl in geothermal water seawater evaporite and deep fluid seawater is the largest pool of cl on earth cl concentration in geothermal water will increase significantly when it is contaminated by seawater avşar et al 2016 baba et al 2019 for example the mixing of seawater and coastal waters in pearl river delta makes the geothermal water have high cl concentration and shows a clear correlation with na and k wei et al 2021 however the absence of correlation between na and cl for lxf geothermal waters suggests that non seawater origin of cl fig 5 a more importantly the area of this study is located inland therefore seawater cannot be the origin of cl in the lxf geothermal waters evaporite is considered to be one of the main sources of cl in geothermal water it is formed by the evaporation and concentration of brine in lake basins and or sea basins and the crystallization of salt substances according to different solubility evaporite mainly composed of chlorides sulfates nitrates and borates when the external fluid flows through the evaporative strata the cl in the strata is leached out and increasing the cl concentration of the fluid as is shown in fig 5 the na cl mole ratio of sample 170 1 1 fig 5a suggesting the cl of sample 170 may originated from evaporite unlike sample 170 the na cl mole ratio of sample 70 and 331 2 1 fig 5a the overabundant na indicating that na may have other origins considering that evaporites generally do not contain carbonate components and the rocks in the study area is mainly carbonate the cl and overabundant na more likely to origin from external fluids than evaporites except sample 170 magmatic and tectonic fluids from the deep can also increase cl concentrations in geothermal waters guo 2012 yangbajing is one of the typical magma source hot springs in the tibet plateau and its cl concentration can reach more than 1000 mg l duo 2003 guo 2012 the geothermal water in the hot dry rock area of gonghe basin in the northeastern of the tibet plateau also has a high cl concentration which is mainly caused by the magmatic activity caused by partial melting of the thickened lower crust pan et al 2021 in addition there are also hot springs with high cl concentration in deep large fault zones such as kangding southwestern china luo et al 2017 xu et al 2022 lxf zone develops intensive structure activities and destructive earthquakes ml 5 0 more than 50 times li et al 2020 the average of its sinistral strike slip movement is 2 4 4 5 mm a since the quaternary xiang et al 2002 indicating that lxf has been flourishing as is shown in fig 6 compared with other samples sample 331 and 281 have higher na contents the na hco3 mole ratio of sample 281 1 1 but the na of sample 331 is overabundant fig 6 in addition sample 331 has high na 586 84 614 77 mg l and cl 503 12 520 47 mg l contents while sample 281 has low cl 78 78 mg l contents therefore sample 331 with higher cl concentration may be contaminated by deep fluid all hot springs are located in the permian carbonate stratum as is shown in fig 7 there is an obvious contrast between samples affected by deep fluid 331 and samples not affected by deep fluid 281 when they react with carbonate rocks therefore high na and cl contents fluid upwell along the faults and mixed with the groundwater increasing na and cl concentrations in sample 331 figs 6 and 7 5 3 origin of other major ions in hot spring waters ca2 and so4 2 show a significant positive correlation therefore the so4 2 from dissolution of anhydrite fig 8 a besides the increase in cl and so4 2 in 170 and 331 is consistent indicating the anhydrite was leached by cl deep fluid in the two samples fig 8b the good correlation between ca2 mg2 and hco3 and cl in our samples indicating that ca2 and mg2 are derived from carbonate stratum fig 7 the samples of this study were collected from carbonate areas ca2 and mg2 were leached out by water rock reaction between high cl fluid and carbonate from the depth the deep fluid flux is insufficient relative to the large amount of carbonate therefore the reaction is more inclined to form co3 2 fig 6 on the contrary the samples not affected by deep high cl fluid are more likely to form hco3 due to the long term reaction between shallow groundwater and carbonate fig 6 geothermal waters can be divided into two types according fig 7 type 1 has higher ca2 mg2 na cl and so4 2 concentration as discussed in 5 2 the na and cl in geothermal waters originated from deep fluids therefore type 1 originated from the reaction between na and cl rich deep fluid and carbonate anhydrite and then leaching out ca2 mg2 and so4 2 from the carbonate anhydrite fig 7 type 2 has lower ca2 mg2 na cl and so4 2 concentration and enriched in hco3 which reflects the reaction of meteoric water and carbonate fig 7 therefore there are two types of geothermal waters type 1 is na cl which from the deep fluid type 2 is na hco3 which from meteoric water researchers have proved that water rock reactions are the main enrichment mechanism of alkali metals in high temperature geothermal fluids pan et al 2021 intriguingly sample 331 with high na 586 87 614 77 mg l concentrations also exhibit high concentrations of li 2 63 2 72 mg l and k 67 34 69 10 mg l table 1 as we mentioned before the na was derived from the deep fluid in addition all of the li na and k are alkali metals therefore it is likely that li and k also origin from deep fluids contaminated by water rock reactions the same explanation apply to cl 503 12 520 47 mg l and f 3 97 4 10 mg l table 1 5 4 water rock reactions 5 4 1 geothermometer and circulation the δ18o value of a few geothermal waters deviated from the lmwl e g 331 which indicates the existence of water rock reaction the na k mg ternary diagram is typically used for the determination of water rock equilibrium conditions giggenbach 1988 as can be seen in fig 9 all thermal water samples plot in the immature water field indicating that the influence of re equilibrium and or strong dilution by precipitation and cold shallow groundwater even more or less affected by carbonate rocks in flowing region particularly sample 331 has relatively high ionic salinity 100 meq kg as illustrated in the correlation plot of na k versus ca2 mg2 fig 10 which may be due to mixing with cold water and or re equilibration upon infiltration of thermal water in shallow aquifers hosted in alluvial and fluvial deposits apollaro et al 2015 mineral geothermometer is a geothermometer method based on the relationship between cationic ratio and temperature in hot water composition all mineral geothermometer methods are empirical approximations the assumption is the case that the concentration of elements or species acting as geothermometer is controlled only by a temperature dependent mineral fluid reaction chenaker et al 2018 wei et al 2021 however dilution mixing and re equilibration processes can also affect the accuracy of mineral thermometers li et al 2021 wang et al 2021 meanwhile different mineral thermometers have different ranges of application therefore an appropriate mineral thermometer should be selected to assess reservoir temperatures the reservoir temperatures estimated by na k k mg li mg na li na ca k ca na k ca quartz and chalcedony geothermometers are listed in table 3 affected by sio2 re equilibration and mixing with ca mg rich shallow water the reservoir temperatures evaluated by silica li mg k mg na ca k ca and na k ca geothermometers are too low or too high which may be sometimes difficult to the actual reservoir temperatures thus the na k and na li geothermometers tend to provide more reliable reservoir temperatures however all thermal water samples are immature water fig 9 the albite and potassium feldspar has not yet reached equilibrium state in the reservoir lithium minerals seem to be very rare in hydrothermal environments thus lithium behaves in hot waters as a soluble element fouillac and michard 1981 na is thought to be reflects an equilibrium between alkali feldspars and deep solutions the na li of the deep fluid is thought to be preserved on ascent to the surface therefore the na li geothermometer seems to be the most reliable to evaluate the deep temperatures inside the confined parts of the carbonate reservoir considering that there may be a large error in the estimation na li geothermometers due to low li contents d amore et al 1987 we only estimate the reservoir temperature of the samples with li content greater than 0 1 mg l as shown in table 3 sample 94 has two distinct temperatures comparing to the na k geothermometer we think 188 c is more appropriate significantly the reservoir temperatures of sample 331 estimated by na k and na li geothermometer are consistent within the calculation errors therefore the reservoir temperatures estimated by na k geothermometer can also be considered as a reference the similar reservoir temperatures of hot springs suggesting that the hydrothermal fluid is likely to originate from the same reservoir positive correlation exists between circulation depth of geothermal water and its temperature as shown in table 4 the circulation depths of springs in the lxf zone calculated based on na k and na li geothermometer is 1663 5954 m 5 4 2 mixing model and ratio the equilibrium state of hydrothermal minerals can be evaluated and the reservoir temperature can be estimated by calculation about mineral equilibrium or saturation at different temperatures the saturation index si for diverse minerals in sample 331 was calculated at the temperature range from 25 to 200 c by using the aquachem phreeqc computer program as is shown in fig 11 aragonite and calcite minerals are oversaturated indicating that the ca2 and mg2 in the sample 331 are oversaturated which is consistent with the fact that the sample 331 is located in carbonate stratum the si with respect to anhydrite minerals exactly converge to zero at 126 c fluorite and quartz minerals are saturated at temperature of 60 c the silicon enthalpy model was first introduced by fournier 1977 using to evaluate and eliminate the effects of the cold water mixing as is shown in fig 12 we used the silicon enthalpy to estimate the proportions of cold water mixing of lxf hot springs the enthalpies and reservoir temperatures of sample 331 and 279 are 708 kj kg 169 c and 522 kj kg 132 c respectively the reservoir temperatures obtained by silicon enthalpy model are basically consistent with that obtained by na li geothermometer the cold water contribution of sample 331 is 94 by using the quantitative calculation method proposed by guo et al 2017 oxygen isotopes are susceptible to water rock reactions leading samples to misplace the lmwl cao et al 2018 in contrast rocks usually have little hydrogen and the water rock reaction has a weak influence on the hydrogen isotopes therefore hydrogen isotopes can be used to confine the source region of the fluid as discussed above the sources of geothermal waters in lxf zone include meteoric water and deep fluids therefore we quantitatively estimate the proportions of meteoric water and deep fluid in the samples by a two end member mixture model c cl c cl m f c cl d 1 f δ d c h δ d m c h m f δ d d c h d 1 f where cx is concentration of x cl h m is meteoric water d is deep fluid f is the proportion of meteoric water the δdm 70 estimated by cao et al 2018 and li et al 2018 in lxf zone the variation of isotope fractionation is related to temperature horita et al 1995 the hydrogen isotope fractionation is about 3 when the temperature is 200 c horita et al 1995 pan et al 2021 the highest reservoir temperatures of geothermal water is 228 c in lxf zone table 3 therefore the hydrogen isotope fractionation is negligible the δdm of deep fluid could be represented by δd of water with highest cl concentration the simulation results are shown in fig 13 all geothermal waters of lxf zone are a mixture of meteoric water and deep fluids and the calculating results correspond with the testing results 5 5 chemical and isotopic characteristics of geothermal gases based on the discussion above we authenticated the possibility of deep fluid in lxf zone however whether the heat source originates from magmatic activity or tectonic activity remains uncertain geothermal gases isotopes provide evidence of the heat source as is shown in fig 4 the r ra of geothermal gas samples range from 0 09 to 0 42 indicating that the helium in the lxf zone primarily has a crustal source fig 4 sano and wakita 1985 it is worth noting that sample 331 have both high cl concentration and typical crustal helium isotopic compositions therefore geothermal water and gas studies suggest deep fluids may originate from deep crust the n2 ar of geothermal gases range from 60 to 123 average is 90 closed to the air 83 6 which suggests that the n2 originated from air the correlation between co2 and n2 implies that the gas of high co2 from the deep mixed with the gas of high n2 from the air fig 14 the δ13c of co2 range from 13 20 to 4 10 with a fractionation of 9 indicating that carbon could be multisource table 2 previous studies have shown that the deep fault zone have carbon flux equivalent to volcanism xu et al 2022 thermal decomposition of metamorphic carbonate released a large amount of co2 hilton et al 2002 taran 2003 tian et al 2018 zelenski and taran 2011 the lxf is located in an active tectonic area and provides a heat source for the decomposition of metamorphic carbonate meanwhile helium isotopes studies indicating that the contribution of mantle carbon to the gases in this study is limited fig 4 therefore the carbon in the geothermal gases may originate from a mix of air metamorphic carbonate and organic to verify the assumption we plot the correlation between δ13c of co2 and n2 ar for the geothermal gases of lxf zone fig 15 the results show that the co2 in the geothermal gases mainly originated from the metamorphic carbonate 70 90 through geothermal gas studies we have demonstrated that deep fluids are mainly from tectonic fluids generated by tectonic activity this is consistent with the fact that lxf is located in a tectonic active region combining chemistry and isotopic compositions studies of geothermal waters and geothermal gases in lxf we suggest that there are significant deep fluids activity in the lxf zone the genetic model of geothermal waters and gases is shown in fig 16 the na cl type fluid produced by deep tectonic activity and the gas enriched in co2 produced by thermal decomposition of metamorphic carbonate upwell together along the fault to the shallow depth which later mixed with the gas enriched in n2 and the na hco3 type water originated from meteoric waters the ca2 and mg2 originated from water rock reaction between geothermal water and carbonate 5 6 indication of seismic activity by deep fluid earthquakes are usually accompanied by disasters understanding the mechanism of earthquakes is the ultimate pursuit of seismologists geothermal water system is relatively stable in quiet period if there is an earthquake brewing or occurring microfracture developed in the basement rock due to seismic stress prior to seismic events thomas 1988 during the microfracturing development the crustal strain dilation or aquifer permeability changes caused mixtures of different water then the concentration of hydrochemistry changed until the earthquake li et al 2021 wang et al 2021 significant cl anomalies were found in groundwater of kobe earthquake in 1995 tsunogai and wakita 1995 and significant na and δd anomalies found in geothermal water of two earthquakes in iceland skelton et al 2014 these evidences suggest that geothermal water can be used for earthquake forecasting lxf is located in a tectonic active zone with an annual slip rate of 2 4 mm a xiang et al 2002 it is a quake prone region seeing more than 50 destructive earthquakes ml 5 0 and 12 earthquakes of magnitude 6 or above within 50 years li et al 2020 as discussed above cl in sample 331 is derived from the fluid generated by deep tectonic activities is there a connection between the changes of cl concentration in hot spring 331and earthquakes to this end a continuous measure was preformed every three days in the 331 and 94 hot spring since august 2020 the result is shown in fig 17 during the seismic quiet period although the ion concentration are fluctuations basically varied within a small range of the mean value however the ion concentration in the spring water showed obvious abnormalities when the earthquake occurred there are at least four times correspondence between ion concentration in two hot spring 94 and 331 and earthquake process 1 yangbi ml 6 4 earthquake on may 21 2021 the yangbi earthquake was 213 km away from 331 hot spring fig 1b and 17 the concentration of so4 2 in 331 hot spring increased abnormally 50 ppm 10 days after the earthquake and decreased slowly after 3 days meanwhile a slight increase in cl concentration was also observed in 331 hot spring 2 luxian ml 6 0 earthquake on september 16 2021 although the luxian earthquake was 481 km away from 331 hot spring fig 1b and 17 obvious abnormal ion concentration in hot spring was recorded 7 days before the earthquake cl na and so4 2 concentration in 331 hot spring were significantly reduced with a change of more than 200 ppm there are similar so4 2 records for 94 hot spring fig 17b after 9 days of abnormal duration na concentration returned to normal level but cl and so4 2 were abnormally high 3 ninglang ml 5 2 earthquake on january 02 2022 and 4 ninglang ml 4 6 earthquake on april 16 2022 ninglang is 49 9 km away from 331 hot spring fig 1b and 17 and ions concentration in 331 hot spring are rising slowly during the ninglang ml 5 2 earthquake on january 02 2022 then the ion concentration basically varied within a small range of the mean value until the ninglang ml 4 6 earthquake on april 16 2022 fig 17 these precursory changes are not accidental in long continuous observations the circulation depth of lxf hot springs range from 1663 to 5954 m table 4 and the reservoir temperatures estimated by na li and na k geothermometers are 77 228 c table 3 when the groundwater circulation depth is deeper the water seeping into the deep ground strengthens the pore fluid pressure promotes the water rock reaction weakens fault zone and is more prone to earthquakes im and avouac 2021 minissale and duchi 1988 during the seismic quiet period the ion concentration in the hot spring remains relatively stable or rising slowly due to the deep fluid contamination e g cl and na at ninglang ml 5 2 earthquake fig 17a when the earthquake happens the earthquake caused rock fragmentation and a large number of groundwater infiltrates along fractures and fissures which later mixed with deep fluids reducing the concentration of ions in the hot spring water e g luxian ml 6 0 earthquake and ninglang ml 4 6 earthquake fig 17 most noteworthy an abnormal rise in ion concentrations in hot springs could also be a signal of an impending earthquake before the ninglang ml 5 2 earthquake both the cl and na concentration of 331 and 94 hot spring show different degrees of rise fig 17 furthermore cl and na concentration of 94 hot spring were significantly increased before luxian ml 6 0 earthquake fig 17b previous studies also show that significant cl anomaly were observed in the groundwater in both the kobe japan and the galicia spain before earthquake perez et al 2008 tsunogai and wakita 1995 therefore we propose that the seismic activity in lxf is closely related to the ion concentration of hot springs unusually high or low ion concentrations in hot springs could represent the process of earthquake development the monitoring of ion concentration in hot spring water is an effective means of earthquake forecasting 5 7 the relationship between lxf earthquake zone and lower crustal flow the tibetan plateau was rapidly uplifted by the collision between the indian plate and the eurasian plate especially in the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau the crust thickness of the tibetan plateau is 20 30 km thicker than that of the sichuan basin due to the difference in crustal thickness there is a transverse pressure gradient in the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau relative to the sichuan basin which created a favorable physical environment for the flow of the lower crust zhang 2013 the hot soft and thick crust of eastern tibetan plateau flowing from west to east blocked by the cold hard and thin crust of sichuan basin causes internal deformation of the western sichuan region zhang 2013 the lxf is located in the transition zone between the tibetan plateau and the yangtze plate geophysical researches have shown that there are low shear velocity layers lvls at 50 km deeps confirming the existence of lower crustal flows under the lxf yao et al 2008 zheng et al 2019 pitard et al 2021 pointed out that lxf may cut through the entire crust and lower crustal flow results in clockwise rotation around the eastern himalaya syntax zhang 2013 the flow of crustal material of lower crust causes internal deformation of the lxf zone since the brittle upper crust of lxf zone is broken by active faults into secondary semi rigid blocks the ductile flow of lower crust would drag these semi rigid blocks to move and rotate with respect to each other the interactions among these semirigid secondary blocks cause strain accumulations among their bounding faults to generate large to moderate size earthquakes within the lxf zone zhang 2013 recent studies have also pointed out that the lxf in ninglang region has an electrical structure that cuts through the high resistance body in the middle and upper crust and is at risk of producing a major earthquake of ml 7 0 or more zhang et al 2022 studies have shown that the existence of a lithospheric scale fault system in the southeastern tibetan plateau and he isotopes provide unambiguous evidence for the involvement of mantle scale dynamics in lateral expansion and localized surface uplift of the tibetan plateau zhang et al 2021a as can be seen from the fig 18 the air ratio of gases in eastern lxf is obviously less than that in western lxf and the mantle contribution in eastern lxf is slightly higher than western lxf the reasons are as follows 1 the western lxf has a thicker crust 60 km and the hot spring gas is mainly from the interior of the crust while the eastern lxf has a thinner crust 25 km and is more affected by mantle degassing 2 the western lxf zone has weak activity and the focal depth is less than 10 km while the eastern lxf zone has strong activity and the focal depth is more than 10 km fig 19 and 3 the western rocks are mainly crust derived granites with high content of radioactive 4he while the eastern rocks are mainly sedimentary rocks metasomatized by the mantle with higher content of 3he lower crustal fluids from the northwest through the lxf and contaminated by mantle material causes the r ra ratio increases the fault reactivation is driven by temperature and pressure changes and thermal unclamping fig 19 shows the seismic data of the lxf region from 2013 to 2022 as can be seen from the fig 19 the focal depth of most western lxf earthquakes is less than 10 km while the focal depth of most eastern earthquakes is greater than 10 km indicating that the deep activity in the southeast is more intense than that in the northwest fig 19 therefore we propose that there is obvious lower crustal flow under the lxf the hot soft and thick crust of eastern tibetan plateau through the lxf flowing from west to east blocked by the cold hard and thin crust of sichuan basin causes internal deformation of the lxf zone and occur earthquakes fig 16 6 conclusion in this study we performed a systematic hydrogeochemistry and isotopic analysis of the geothermal waters and gases in the lxf zone of the southeastern tibetan plateau and identified a parent geothermal fluid by integrating geochemical results of geothermal waters and gases we suggest that there are significant deep fluids activity in the lxf zone the na cl type fluid produced by deep tectonic activity and the gas enriched in co2 produced by thermal decomposition of metamorphic carbonate upwell together along the fault to the shallow depth which later mixed with the gas enriched in n2 and the na hco3 type water originated from meteoric waters the ca2 and mg2 originate from water rock reaction between geothermal water and carbonate there is obvious lower crustal flow under the lxf the hot soft and thick crust of eastern tibetan plateau through the lxf flowing from west to east blocked by the cold hard and thin crust of sichuan basin causes internal deformation of the lxf zone and occur earthquakes faults play a crucial role in controlling the migration of crustal fluids ion concentrations in hot springs are sensitive to seismic activity in lxf zone unusually high or low ion concentrations in hot springs could represent the process of earthquake development real time monitoring of the variation in chemical and isotopic compositions of proper geothermal waters and gases in lxf will help us to study the pre seismic hydrochemical precursors and provides basis for earthquake forecasting credit

2174,geothermal fluid is considered to be one of the important methods of earthquake forecasting and some achievements have been made in previous studies however there is still a lot of work to be done before geothermal fluid can actually be used for earthquake forecasting lijiang xiaojinhe fault lxf which is a quake prone region that lies on the border of tibetan plateau and yangtze block is a good natural experimental field for earthquake research in this contribution we performed a systematic hydrogeochemistry and isotopic analysis of the geothermal waters and gases in the lxf zone high cl 0 69 529 44 mg l concentrations in hot springs indicate that they are contaminated by deep fluid obviously further continuous observation 2020 2022 indicates that there are at least four times correspondence between ion concentration in two hot springs jinhe 94 and xiaoshuiping 331 two earthquakes ml 5 2 earthquake on january 02 2022 and ml 4 6 earthquake on april 16 2022 in ninglang are only 50 km away from 331 hot spring and obvious abnormal concentrations of cl na and so4 2 were observed before the earthquakes combined with geological background and previous studies we propose that lower crustal flow could be the reason why earthquake prone in lxf the lower crust flow through the lxf from northwest to southeast causes internal deformation of the lxf zone then a large amount of groundwater infiltrates deep underground along the fault strengthens the pore fluid pressure promotes the water rock reaction weakens fault zone and trigger earthquakes ion concentrations in hot springs are sensitive to seismic activity in lxf unusually high or low ion concentrations in hot springs could represent the process of earthquake development monitoring proper geothermal waters and gases in lxf will help us to study the pre seismic hydrochemical precursors and have a potential to provide important bases for earthquake forecasting keywords southeastern tibetan plateau geothermal fluid water rock reaction lijiang xiaojinhe fault hot spring lower crustal flow data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction earthquake is controlled by the intermittent energy liberation in the earth which is suddenly and destructively for example 5 12 wenchuan earthquake in china and 3 11 fukushima earthquake in japan for a long time the gestation and causative mechanism of earthquake is always a tough task in seismology geothermal water and gas geochemistry are two of the methods of seismic research earthquakes are usually accompanied by the release of large amounts of gases e g co2 boschetti et al 2022 chiodini et al 2011 famin et al 2008 miller et al 2004 an overwhelming quantity of gas accumulated in the deep to form high pressure gas reservoirs which may act as a trigger for aftershocks miller et al 2004 in addition the isotopic compositions of gas are sensitive to earthquake researches have shown that the region with higher helium isotopic composition given as r ra ra air 3he 4he 1 39 10 6 the stronger tectonic activity and more prone to earthquakes kennedy and van soest 2006 the chemical compositions of geothermal water can be affected by earthquake barbieri et al 2021 franchini et al 2021 king et al 2006 wang et al 2022 2023 previous studies show that significant cl anomaly was observed in the groundwater in both the kobe japan and the galicia spain before earthquake perez et al 2008 tsunogai and wakita 1995 the increase in cl concentration may reflect the intensification of deep tectonic activity other geochemical indices like δd δ18o δ11b na so4 2 pb etc were also observed anomalies when the earthquake occurred barbieri et al 2021 franchini et al 2021 li et al 2021 poitrasson et al 1999 skelton et al 2014 wang et al 2021 although previous researches have made some research achievements in using geothermal water and gas for earthquake forecasting there are still difficulties in dealing with short term or imminent earthquake forecasting due to long sample collection interval in addition geochemical indices are easily affected by changes in external temperature and pressure surrounding rock types and multi sources of fluid and or gas which make it difficult to identify anomalies of geochemical indices accurately therefore accurately identifying the origin circulation and water rock reaction process of geothermal water will help to improve the ability to identify geochemical anomalies in earthquakes and provide bases for earthquake forecasting the lijiang xiaojinhe fault lxf zone is enriched in geothermal resources at least a dozen of hot springs have been discovered in the area fig 1 meanwhile it is a quake prone region that lies on the border with tibetan plateau and yangtze block including more than 50 destructive earthquakes ml 5 0 and 12 earthquakes of magnitude 6 or above within 50 years li et al 2020 the largest earthquake ever recorded was the 1996 lijiang earthquake with a magnitude of 7 0 ding et al 2018 therefore lxf is a favorable area for geothermal and seismological research herein in order to explore how to accurately identify the geochemical anomalies during the gestation and occurrence of earthquakes we perform a detailed geochemical and isotopic analysis of geothermal waters and gases collected from the lxf zone to trace the source and migration mechanism of hot springs and explore the variation of geochemical indices of geothermal water in the process of tectonic activities this research is valuable for understanding the relationship between geothermal water and earthquake 2 geologic background the lxf is located in the southeastern margin of the tibetan plateau which is the boundary between the eurasian plate and the indian plate fig 1 neotectonic movement is actively in the area multiple active faults developed since cenozoic such as xianshuihe xiaojiang fault xxf longmenshan fault lmsf and honghe fault hhf lxf is the southward extension of lmsf xu et al 2007 and controlled by sinistral shear stress of the xxf xiang et al 2002 lxf starts from jianchuan in the southwest and goes northeast through lijiang ninglang and muli then turns to nne and converging on xxf in shimian eventually fig 1 the length of lxf is over 300 km xiang et al 2002 and includes three belts the south inner and north belts the south belt from jianchuan to lijiang has 30 40 km long and contains two main branch faults with a small basin between them li et al 2020 the inner belt from lijiang to muli and 150 km long while dislocation landform

ding et al 2018 igneous rocks are less exposed and mainly including basalts and granites fig 1 lxf zone is subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 13 20 and annual precipitation of 750 900 mm due to its location in the hengduan mountains in southwest china the climate in the territory is obviously vertically distributed with snow capped mountains and abundant

analytical methods 3 1 geothermal water samples collection and analysis a total of 22 samples of geothermal water were collected repeatedly from 14 site of hot spring and well along the lxf during 2013 to 2021 table 1 fig 1 about 50 ml of geothermal water samples were collected using a clean polyethylene bottle while the temperature and ph of the hot spring were recorded at least two bottles of water samples were collected at each sampling site one bottle was dripped with ultrapure hno3 for cation analysis and the other for anion and isotope analysis filtrating through 0 45 μm membrane was required for each sample before testing the cation and anion were analyzed using dionex ics 900 ion chromatograph thermo fisher scientific inc sunnyvale ca usa at the earthquake forecasting key

precisions on the measured δ18o and δd value was 0 2 2sd and 1 2sd respectively wang et al 2010 3 2 geothermal gas samples collection and analysis we collected 7 geothermal gas samples from hot spring by water displacement method detailed chemical procedure can be found in zhang et al 2021b in brief a glass bottle was connected to a funnel and filled with spring water to make sure no air bubbles inside it put them upside down in the spring allowing the accumulated bubbles entering into the bottle to displace spring water out disconnecting the funnel under water while stoppering the bottle

value and the external precision on the measured δ13cco2 values was better than 0 3 zhang et al 2021b 4 results 4 1 geothermal waters chemical and isotopic compositions geothermal waters chemical and isotopic compositions are listed in table 1 the temperature of waters varies from 12 7 to 57 4 c and the mean temperature of 22 hot spring samples is 31 c sample 280 12 7 c and 279 57 4 c have the lowest and highest temperatures respectively the ph values of samples varied from 6 57 to 9 76 which indicates neutral to alkaline conditions the samples have wide range of na 2 19 614 77 mg l ca2 5 63 273 92 mg l and mg2 1 82 85 26 mg l concentration anion is mainly hco3 120 94 1292 01 mg l the waters are ca mg hco3 and na cl types according to the piper diagram fig 2 significantly sample 70 170 and 331 have high cl 164 2 529 44 mg l and so4 2 54 45 627 02 mg l contents the high concentrations of cl in hot spring probably originated from the mixing with deep fluid pan et al 2021 the δ18o and δd of samples varied from 21 5 to 9 5 and 125 to 74 respectively which is near to the local meteoric water line lmwl of the lijiang δd 6 56 δ18o 2 96 r2 0 91 n 151 cao et al 2018 fig 3 suggesting their meteoric origin sample 70 170 and 331 present the higher cl contents and the lighter h and o isotopic compositions 4 2 geothermal gas samples chemical and isotopic compositions geothermal gas samples chemical and isotopic compositions are listed in table 2 major gas species of the samples are either co2 or n2 or both of them the r ra of gas samples range from 0 09ra to 0 42ra falling in the typical crustal value 0 01 0 05ra fig 4 sano and wakita 1985 helium contents range from 157 2 to 10938 ppm sample 331 presents the highest he contents and 4he 20ne value 1174 80 carbon isotope values of gaseous co2 in our samples range from 13 20 to 4 10 with a fractionation of 9 indicating that the co2 of gas samples could be multisource 5 discussion 5 1 origin of geothermal waters numerous studies have shown that almost all geothermal waters originated from recirculating meteoric waters which were mixed with a small amount of deep fluid or not hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes is one of method to identify the origin of spring water craig 1961 the δ18o and δd of geothermal waters of lxf varied from 21 5 to 9 5 and 125 to 74 respectively which is near to the lmwl of the lijiang δd 6 56 δ18o 2 96 r2 0 91 n 151 fig 3 cao et al 2018 suggesting their meteoric origin as is shown in fig 3 the δ18o value of a few geothermal waters deviated from the lmwl and inclined to higher indicating that the isotopic exchange of 18o with rock that came into contact with the water fig 3 the altitude effect means the change in the stable isotopic composition of precipitation with elevation li et al 2018 in the evaporation process of water light isotopes are preferentially enriched in the gas phase therefore the higher the altitude the more enriched the light isotope compositions craig 1961 the average altitude sampled of lxf zone were about 2200 m table 1 the correlation between oxygen isotopes and altitude in hengduan mountains has been studied by li et al 2018 which show that the δ18o and altitude of the hengduan mountains conformed to δ18o 0 0028 m 3 93 m is altitude li et al 2018 combining with the lmwl δd 6 56 δ18o 2 96 cao et al 2018 the δd and δ18o values of meteoric water in the region are estimated to 70 and 10 respectively it is comparable to the heaviest isotopic composition of the geothermal waters in this study table 1 there are snow capped mountains all year round in the area and the δd and δ18o of snow melt water are 184 and 27 respectively li et al 2018 most geothermal waters have lighter hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions than meteoric water in our samples especially water 70 shows the lowest δd 125 and δ18o 16 5 value table 1 light hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of waters suggesting the contamination of potentially snow water nevertheless the cl concentration of the snow mountain water is very low pan et al 2021 which is inconsistent with the fact that the high contents of cl 149 29 mg l in same waters like water 70 170 and 331 the high cl 164 2 529 44 mg l contents indicating other origins of geothermal waters in lxf zone where is the origin of cl in hot waters which will be discussed in detail next 5 2 origin of cl in geothermal water chloride minus is one of the important chemical indices in geothermal water and can be used to investigate the hydrogeochemical processes of geothermal waters and to constraint the origin of parent geothermal fluid pan et al 2021 truesdell et al 1989 wang et al 2018 studies have shown that there are three main origin of cl in geothermal water seawater evaporite and deep fluid seawater is the largest pool of cl on earth cl concentration in geothermal water will increase significantly when it is contaminated by seawater avşar et al 2016 baba et al 2019 for example the mixing of seawater and coastal waters in pearl river delta makes the geothermal water have high cl concentration and shows a clear correlation with na and k wei et al 2021 however the absence of correlation between na and cl for lxf geothermal waters suggests that non seawater origin of cl fig 5 a more importantly the area of this study is located inland therefore seawater cannot be the origin of cl in the lxf geothermal waters evaporite is considered to be one of the main sources of cl in geothermal water it is formed by the evaporation and concentration of brine in lake basins and or sea basins and the crystallization of salt substances according to different solubility evaporite mainly composed of chlorides sulfates nitrates and borates when the external fluid flows through the evaporative strata the cl in the strata is leached out and increasing the cl concentration of the fluid as is shown in fig 5 the na cl mole ratio of sample 170 1 1 fig 5a suggesting the cl of sample 170 may originated from evaporite unlike sample 170 the na cl mole ratio of sample 70 and 331 2 1 fig 5a the overabundant na indicating that na may have other origins considering that evaporites generally do not contain carbonate components and the rocks in the study area is mainly carbonate the cl and overabundant na more likely to origin from external fluids than evaporites except sample 170 magmatic and tectonic fluids from the deep can also increase cl concentrations in geothermal waters guo 2012 yangbajing is one of the typical magma source hot springs in the tibet plateau and its cl concentration can reach more than 1000 mg l duo 2003 guo 2012 the geothermal water in the hot dry rock area of gonghe basin in the northeastern of the tibet plateau also has a high cl concentration which is mainly caused by the magmatic activity caused by partial melting of the thickened lower crust pan et al 2021 in addition there are also hot springs with high cl concentration in deep large fault zones such as kangding southwestern china luo et al 2017 xu et al 2022 lxf zone develops intensive structure activities and destructive earthquakes ml 5 0 more than 50 times li et al 2020 the average of its sinistral strike slip movement is 2 4 4 5 mm a since the quaternary xiang et al 2002 indicating that lxf has been flourishing as is shown in fig 6 compared with other samples sample 331 and 281 have higher na contents the na hco3 mole ratio of sample 281 1 1 but the na of sample 331 is overabundant fig 6 in addition sample 331 has high na 586 84 614 77 mg l and cl 503 12 520 47 mg l contents while sample 281 has low cl 78 78 mg l contents therefore sample 331 with higher cl concentration may be contaminated by deep fluid all hot springs are located in the permian carbonate stratum as is shown in fig 7 there is an obvious contrast between samples affected by deep fluid 331 and samples not affected by deep fluid 281 when they react with carbonate rocks therefore high na and cl contents fluid upwell along the faults and mixed with the groundwater increasing na and cl concentrations in sample 331 figs 6 and 7 5 3 origin of other major ions in hot spring waters ca2 and so4 2 show a significant positive correlation therefore the so4 2 from dissolution of anhydrite fig 8 a besides the increase in cl and so4 2 in 170 and 331 is consistent indicating the anhydrite was leached by cl deep fluid in the two samples fig 8b the good correlation between ca2 mg2 and hco3 and cl in our samples indicating that ca2 and mg2 are derived from carbonate stratum fig 7 the samples of this study were collected from carbonate areas ca2 and mg2 were leached out by water rock reaction between high cl fluid and carbonate from the depth the deep fluid flux is insufficient relative to the large amount of carbonate therefore the reaction is more inclined to form co3 2 fig 6 on the contrary the samples not affected by deep high cl fluid are more likely to form hco3 due to the long term reaction between shallow groundwater and carbonate fig 6 geothermal waters can be divided into two types according fig 7 type 1 has higher ca2 mg2 na cl and so4 2 concentration as discussed in 5 2 the na and cl in geothermal waters originated from deep fluids therefore type 1 originated from the reaction between na and cl rich deep fluid and carbonate anhydrite and then leaching out ca2 mg2 and so4 2 from the carbonate anhydrite fig 7 type 2 has lower ca2 mg2 na cl and so4 2 concentration and enriched in hco3 which reflects the reaction of meteoric water and carbonate fig 7 therefore there are two types of geothermal waters type 1 is na cl which from the deep fluid type 2 is na hco3 which from meteoric water researchers have proved that water rock reactions are the main enrichment mechanism of alkali metals in high temperature geothermal fluids pan et al 2021 intriguingly sample 331 with high na 586 87 614 77 mg l concentrations also exhibit high concentrations of li 2 63 2 72 mg l and k 67 34 69 10 mg l table 1 as we mentioned before the na was derived from the deep fluid in addition all of the li na and k are alkali metals therefore it is likely that li and k also origin from deep fluids contaminated by water rock reactions the same explanation apply to cl 503 12 520 47 mg l and f 3 97 4 10 mg l table 1 5 4 water rock reactions 5 4 1 geothermometer and circulation the δ18o value of a few geothermal waters deviated from the lmwl e g 331 which indicates the existence of water rock reaction the na k mg ternary diagram is typically used for the determination of water rock equilibrium conditions giggenbach 1988 as can be seen in fig 9 all thermal water samples plot in the immature water field indicating that the influence of re equilibrium and or strong dilution by precipitation and cold shallow groundwater even more or less affected by carbonate rocks in flowing region particularly sample 331 has relatively high ionic salinity 100 meq kg as illustrated in the correlation plot of na k versus ca2 mg2 fig 10 which may be due to mixing with cold water and or re equilibration upon infiltration of thermal water in shallow aquifers hosted in alluvial and fluvial deposits apollaro et al 2015 mineral geothermometer is a geothermometer method based on the relationship between cationic ratio and temperature in hot water composition all mineral geothermometer methods are empirical approximations the assumption is the case that the concentration of elements or species acting as geothermometer is controlled only by a temperature dependent mineral fluid reaction chenaker et al 2018 wei et al 2021 however dilution mixing and re equilibration processes can also affect the accuracy of mineral thermometers li et al 2021 wang et al 2021 meanwhile different mineral thermometers have different ranges of application therefore an appropriate mineral thermometer should be selected to assess reservoir temperatures the reservoir temperatures estimated by na k k mg li mg na li na ca k ca na k ca quartz and chalcedony geothermometers are listed in table 3 affected by sio2 re equilibration and mixing with ca mg rich shallow water the reservoir temperatures evaluated by silica li mg k mg na ca k ca and na k ca geothermometers are too low or too high which may be sometimes difficult to the actual reservoir temperatures thus the na k and na li geothermometers tend to provide more reliable reservoir temperatures however all thermal water samples are immature water fig 9 the albite and potassium feldspar has not yet reached equilibrium state in the reservoir lithium minerals seem to be very rare in hydrothermal environments thus lithium behaves in hot waters as a soluble element fouillac and michard 1981 na is thought to be reflects an equilibrium between alkali feldspars and deep solutions the na li of the deep fluid is thought to be preserved on ascent to the surface therefore the na li geothermometer seems to be the most reliable to evaluate the deep temperatures inside the confined parts of the carbonate reservoir considering that there may be a large error in the estimation na li geothermometers due to low li contents d amore et al 1987 we only estimate the reservoir temperature of the samples with li content greater than 0 1 mg l as shown in table 3 sample 94 has two distinct temperatures comparing to the na k geothermometer we think 188 c is more appropriate significantly the reservoir temperatures of sample 331 estimated by na k and na li geothermometer are consistent within the calculation errors therefore the reservoir temperatures estimated by na k geothermometer can also be considered as a reference the similar reservoir temperatures of hot springs suggesting that the hydrothermal fluid is likely to originate from the same reservoir positive correlation exists between circulation depth of geothermal water and its temperature as shown in table 4 the circulation depths of springs in the lxf zone calculated based on na k and na li geothermometer is 1663 5954 m 5 4 2 mixing model and ratio the equilibrium state of hydrothermal minerals can be evaluated and the reservoir temperature can be estimated by calculation about mineral equilibrium or saturation at different temperatures the saturation index si for diverse minerals in sample 331 was calculated at the temperature range from 25 to 200 c by using the aquachem phreeqc computer program as is shown in fig 11 aragonite and calcite minerals are oversaturated indicating that the ca2 and mg2 in the sample 331 are oversaturated which is consistent with the fact that the sample 331 is located in carbonate stratum the si with respect to anhydrite minerals exactly converge to zero at 126 c fluorite and quartz minerals are saturated at temperature of 60 c the silicon enthalpy model was first introduced by fournier 1977 using to evaluate and eliminate the effects of the cold water mixing as is shown in fig 12 we used the silicon enthalpy to estimate the proportions of cold water mixing of lxf hot springs the enthalpies and reservoir temperatures of sample 331 and 279 are 708 kj kg 169 c and 522 kj kg 132 c respectively the reservoir temperatures obtained by silicon enthalpy model are basically consistent with that obtained by na li geothermometer the cold water contribution of sample 331 is 94 by using the quantitative calculation method proposed by guo et al 2017 oxygen isotopes are susceptible to water rock reactions leading samples to misplace the lmwl cao et al 2018 in contrast rocks usually have little hydrogen and the water rock reaction has a weak influence on the hydrogen isotopes therefore hydrogen isotopes can be used to confine the source region of the fluid as discussed above the sources of geothermal waters in lxf zone include meteoric water and deep fluids therefore we quantitatively estimate the proportions of meteoric water and deep fluid in the samples by a two end member mixture model c cl c cl m f c cl d 1 f δ d c h δ d m c h m f δ d d c h d 1 f where cx is concentration of x cl h m is meteoric water d is deep fluid f is the proportion of meteoric water the δdm 70 estimated by cao et al 2018 and li et al 2018 in lxf zone the variation of isotope fractionation is related to temperature horita et al 1995 the hydrogen isotope fractionation is about 3 when the temperature is 200 c horita et al 1995 pan et al 2021 the highest reservoir temperatures of geothermal water is 228 c in lxf zone table 3 therefore the hydrogen isotope fractionation is negligible the δdm of deep fluid could be represented by δd of water with highest cl concentration the simulation results are shown in fig 13 all geothermal waters of lxf zone are a mixture of meteoric water and deep fluids and the calculating results correspond with the testing results 5 5 chemical and isotopic characteristics of geothermal gases based on the discussion above we authenticated the possibility of deep fluid in lxf zone however whether the heat source originates from magmatic activity or tectonic activity remains uncertain geothermal gases isotopes provide evidence of the heat source as is shown in fig 4 the r ra of geothermal gas samples range from 0 09 to 0 42 indicating that the helium in the lxf zone primarily has a crustal source fig 4 sano and wakita 1985 it is worth noting that sample 331 have both high cl concentration and typical crustal helium isotopic compositions therefore geothermal water and gas studies suggest deep fluids may originate from deep crust the n2 ar of geothermal gases range from 60 to 123 average is 90 closed to the air 83 6 which suggests that the n2 originated from air the correlation between co2 and n2 implies that the gas of high co2 from the deep mixed with the gas of high n2 from the air fig 14 the δ13c of co2 range from 13 20 to 4 10 with a fractionation of 9 indicating that carbon could be multisource table 2 previous studies have shown that the deep fault zone have carbon flux equivalent to volcanism xu et al 2022 thermal decomposition of metamorphic carbonate released a large amount of co2 hilton et al 2002 taran 2003 tian et al 2018 zelenski and taran 2011 the lxf is located in an active tectonic area and provides a heat source for the decomposition of metamorphic carbonate meanwhile helium isotopes studies indicating that the contribution of mantle carbon to the gases in this study is limited fig 4 therefore the carbon in the geothermal gases may originate from a mix of air metamorphic carbonate and organic to verify the assumption we plot the correlation between δ13c of co2 and n2 ar for the geothermal gases of lxf zone fig 15 the results show that the co2 in the geothermal gases mainly originated from the metamorphic carbonate 70 90 through geothermal gas studies we have demonstrated that deep fluids are mainly from tectonic fluids generated by tectonic activity this is consistent with the fact that lxf is located in a tectonic active region combining chemistry and isotopic compositions studies of geothermal waters and geothermal gases in lxf we suggest that there are significant deep fluids activity in the lxf zone the genetic model of geothermal waters and gases is shown in fig 16 the na cl type fluid produced by deep tectonic activity and the gas enriched in co2 produced by thermal decomposition of metamorphic carbonate upwell together along the fault to the shallow depth which later mixed with the gas enriched in n2 and the na hco3 type water originated from meteoric waters the ca2 and mg2 originated from water rock reaction between geothermal water and carbonate 5 6 indication of seismic activity by deep fluid earthquakes are usually accompanied by disasters understanding the mechanism of earthquakes is the ultimate pursuit of seismologists geothermal water system is relatively stable in quiet period if there is an earthquake brewing or occurring microfracture developed in the basement rock due to seismic stress prior to seismic events thomas 1988 during the microfracturing development the crustal strain dilation or aquifer permeability changes caused mixtures of different water then the concentration of hydrochemistry changed until the earthquake li et al 2021 wang et al 2021 significant cl anomalies were found in groundwater of kobe earthquake in 1995 tsunogai and wakita 1995 and significant na and δd anomalies found in geothermal water of two earthquakes in iceland skelton et al 2014 these evidences suggest that geothermal water can be used for earthquake forecasting lxf is located in a tectonic active zone with an annual slip rate of 2 4 mm a xiang et al 2002 it is a quake prone region seeing more than 50 destructive earthquakes ml 5 0 and 12 earthquakes of magnitude 6 or above within 50 years li et al 2020 as discussed above cl in sample 331 is derived from the fluid generated by deep tectonic activities is there a connection between the changes of cl concentration in hot spring 331and earthquakes to this end a continuous measure was preformed every three days in the 331 and 94 hot spring since august 2020 the result is shown in fig 17 during the seismic quiet period although the ion concentration are fluctuations basically varied within a small range of the mean value however the ion concentration in the spring water showed obvious abnormalities when the earthquake occurred there are at least four times correspondence between ion concentration in two hot spring 94 and 331 and earthquake process 1 yangbi ml 6 4 earthquake on may 21 2021 the yangbi earthquake was 213 km away from 331 hot spring fig 1b and 17 the concentration of so4 2 in 331 hot spring increased abnormally 50 ppm 10 days after the earthquake and decreased slowly after 3 days meanwhile a slight increase in cl concentration was also observed in 331 hot spring 2 luxian ml 6 0 earthquake on september 16 2021 although the luxian earthquake was 481 km away from 331 hot spring fig 1b and 17 obvious abnormal ion concentration in hot spring was recorded 7 days before the earthquake cl na and so4 2 concentration in 331 hot spring were significantly reduced with a change of more than 200 ppm there are similar so4 2 records for 94 hot spring fig 17b after 9 days of abnormal duration na concentration returned to normal level but cl and so4 2 were abnormally high 3 ninglang ml 5 2 earthquake on january 02 2022 and 4 ninglang ml 4 6 earthquake on april 16 2022 ninglang is 49 9 km away from 331 hot spring fig 1b and 17 and ions concentration in 331 hot spring are rising slowly during the ninglang ml 5 2 earthquake on january 02 2022 then the ion concentration basically varied within a small range of the mean value until the ninglang ml 4 6 earthquake on april 16 2022 fig 17 these precursory changes are not accidental in long continuous observations the circulation depth of lxf hot springs range from 1663 to 5954 m table 4 and the reservoir temperatures estimated by na li and na k geothermometers are 77 228 c table 3 when the groundwater circulation depth is deeper the water seeping into the deep ground strengthens the pore fluid pressure promotes the water rock reaction weakens fault zone and is more prone to earthquakes im and avouac 2021 minissale and duchi 1988 during the seismic quiet period the ion concentration in the hot spring remains relatively stable or rising slowly due to the deep fluid contamination e g cl and na at ninglang ml 5 2 earthquake fig 17a when the earthquake happens the earthquake caused rock fragmentation and a large number of groundwater infiltrates along fractures and fissures which later mixed with deep fluids reducing the concentration of ions in the hot spring water e g luxian ml 6 0 earthquake and ninglang ml 4 6 earthquake fig 17 most noteworthy an abnormal rise in ion concentrations in hot springs could also be a signal of an impending earthquake before the ninglang ml 5 2 earthquake both the cl and na concentration of 331 and 94 hot spring show different degrees of rise fig 17 furthermore cl and na concentration of 94 hot spring were significantly increased before luxian ml 6 0 earthquake fig 17b previous studies also show that significant cl anomaly were observed in the groundwater in both the kobe japan and the galicia spain before earthquake perez et al 2008 tsunogai and wakita 1995 therefore we propose that the seismic activity in lxf is closely related to the ion concentration of hot springs unusually high or low ion concentrations in hot springs could represent the process of earthquake development the monitoring of ion concentration in hot spring water is an effective means of earthquake forecasting 5 7 the relationship between lxf earthquake zone and lower crustal flow the tibetan plateau was rapidly uplifted by the collision between the indian plate and the eurasian plate especially in the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau the crust thickness of the tibetan plateau is 20 30 km thicker than that of the sichuan basin due to the difference in crustal thickness there is a transverse pressure gradient in the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau relative to the sichuan basin which created a favorable physical environment for the flow of the lower crust zhang 2013 the hot soft and thick crust of eastern tibetan plateau flowing from west to east blocked by the cold hard and thin crust of sichuan basin causes internal deformation of the western sichuan region zhang 2013 the lxf is located in the transition zone between the tibetan plateau and the yangtze plate geophysical researches have shown that there are low shear velocity layers lvls at 50 km deeps confirming the existence of lower crustal flows under the lxf yao et al 2008 zheng et al 2019 pitard et al 2021 pointed out that lxf may cut through the entire crust and lower crustal flow results in clockwise rotation around the eastern himalaya syntax zhang 2013 the flow of crustal material of lower crust causes internal deformation of the lxf zone since the brittle upper crust of lxf zone is broken by active faults into secondary semi rigid blocks the ductile flow of lower crust would drag these semi rigid blocks to move and rotate with respect to each other the interactions among these semirigid secondary blocks cause strain accumulations among their bounding faults to generate large to moderate size earthquakes within the lxf zone zhang 2013 recent studies have also pointed out that the lxf in ninglang region has an electrical structure that cuts through the high resistance body in the middle and upper crust and is at risk of producing a major earthquake of ml 7 0 or more zhang et al 2022 studies have shown that the existence of a lithospheric scale fault system in the southeastern tibetan plateau and he isotopes provide unambiguous evidence for the involvement of mantle scale dynamics in lateral expansion and localized surface uplift of the tibetan plateau zhang et al 2021a as can be seen from the fig 18 the air ratio of gases in eastern lxf is obviously less than that in western lxf and the mantle contribution in eastern lxf is slightly higher than western lxf the reasons are as follows 1 the western lxf has a thicker crust 60 km and the hot spring gas is mainly from the interior of the crust while the eastern lxf has a thinner crust 25 km and is more affected by mantle degassing 2 the western lxf zone has weak activity and the focal depth is less than 10 km while the eastern lxf zone has strong activity and the focal depth is more than 10 km fig 19 and 3 the western rocks are mainly crust derived granites with high content of radioactive 4he while the eastern rocks are mainly sedimentary rocks metasomatized by the mantle with higher content of 3he lower crustal fluids from the northwest through the lxf and contaminated by mantle material causes the r ra ratio increases the fault reactivation is driven by temperature and pressure changes and thermal unclamping fig 19 shows the seismic data of the lxf region from 2013 to 2022 as can be seen from the fig 19 the focal depth of most western lxf earthquakes is less than 10 km while the focal depth of most eastern earthquakes is greater than 10 km indicating that the deep activity in the southeast is more intense than that in the northwest fig 19 therefore we propose that there is obvious lower crustal flow under the lxf the hot soft and thick crust of eastern tibetan plateau through the lxf flowing from west to east blocked by the cold hard and thin crust of sichuan basin causes internal deformation of the lxf zone and occur earthquakes fig 16 6 conclusion in this study we performed a systematic hydrogeochemistry and isotopic analysis of the geothermal waters and gases in the lxf zone of the southeastern tibetan plateau and identified a parent geothermal fluid by integrating geochemical results of geothermal waters and gases we suggest that there are significant deep fluids activity in the lxf zone the na cl type fluid produced by deep tectonic activity and the gas enriched in co2 produced by thermal decomposition of metamorphic carbonate upwell together along the fault to the shallow depth which later mixed with the gas enriched in n2 and the na hco3 type water originated from meteoric waters the ca2 and mg2 originate from water rock reaction between geothermal water and carbonate there is obvious lower crustal flow under the lxf the hot soft and thick crust of eastern tibetan plateau through the lxf flowing from west to east blocked by the cold hard and thin crust of sichuan basin causes internal deformation of the lxf zone and occur earthquakes faults play a crucial role in controlling the migration of crustal fluids ion concentrations in hot springs are sensitive to seismic activity in lxf zone unusually high or low ion concentrations in hot springs could represent the process of earthquake development real time monitoring of the variation in chemical and isotopic compositions of proper geothermal waters and gases in lxf will help us to study the pre seismic hydrochemical precursors and provides basis for earthquake forecasting credit
