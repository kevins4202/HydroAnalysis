9925,global climate change has effected the snow covers and precipitation patterns leading to unreliable surface water availability for agricultural usage many studies suggest that demand based surface water management instead of supply based management may significantly mitigate the problem of supply side fluctuations such management schemes have now been brought to the forefront due to the recent advances in information and communication technologies icts in the absence of a demand based water distribution mechanism in the indus basin irrigation network inequity and unreliability feature prominently this research contributes to addressing these problems by proposing a demand driven allocation scheme for surface water coupled with an auction based pricing mechanism we compare the proposed scheme with the currently practiced water distribution mechanism in ibis indus basin irrigation system by conducting a pilot study whose site is located in central punjab pakistan our simulations suggest that under certain realistic assumptions the proposed mechanism leads to a more efficient allocation of surface water resulting in lower exploitation of groundwater resources and potentially higher agricultural yield due to improved water availability graphical abstract ga1 keywords farm level water management irrigation distribution system surface water management 1 introduction water is an essential common pool resource cpr that is important for life on earth and sustains agriculture for human societies water scarcity and fluctuations are increasing in many parts of the world due to climate change population and economic growth gleick 2018 distefano and kelly 2017 in recent years water quality is deteriorating in several countries causing a threat to food security in these countries and increasing concern for further water availability boyd 2019 it is therefore necessary that the existing water resources be distributed among users more efficiently in the agriculture sector the low profit and large losses of water have served as an argument for efficient agricultural water management irrigated agriculture now occupies 20 of the total cultivated land globally fao 2010 however the feasibility of new irrigation projects to ensure food security is questionable given the increasing agitation over the negative consequences of large infrastructures dams reservoirs land losses due to salinization huang et al 2018 and efficiency related paradoxes grafton et al 2018 reforms in water related policies are considered one of the most effective instruments available to enhance water efficiency johansson et al 2002 in this context the nobel prize winner elinor ostrom has identified concrete design principals to craft institutions for long enduring irrigation systems which include monitoring and efficient allocation of water ostrom 1993 therefore among the many different aspects of an irrigation system water allocation related policies are essential during the last decade the farming sector has seen the introduction of sensing and control technologies that have the potential to improve the information accessibility of farmers leading towards efficient use of water resources galioto et al 2020 lack of use of information and communication based technologies in the agriculture sector is a major problem as it increases pressure on water resources and contributes to unsustainable agricultural practices due to uncertain information environment nakasone and torero 2016 the information led technologies and value of information concepts have been used in numerous fields e g engineering economics medicine and finance but this concept has seldom been used in the agriculture sector galioto et al 2020 here we leverage the availability of such technologies to formulate a water allocation mechanism in this mechanism users make decisions using information provided by ict based sensing technologies the allocation of water and the objectives of water related policies can be obtained through several allocation mechanisms water distribution mechanisms range from fully centralized control by the government to completely decentralized water markets dinar et al 2015 past literature that investigates water allocation and pricing mechanisms worldwide include dinar and subramanian 1998 jones 2000 johansson et al 2002 tsur et al 2004a 2004b dinar and mody 2004 molle and berkoff 2007 these studies compare the efficiency among different water allocation and pricing mechanisms and compare the experiences and policies in the global setting the conclusion of these and other related studies is that no single type of water allocation and pricing mechanism is optimal in all contexts therefore there is no best practice that can be suggested to one country or region dinar et al 2015 water users in various countries and regions face different problems and needs for water allocation and pricing mechanisms furthermore future water scarcity produced by climate change will most likely lead to different water allocation and pricing needs than those addressed by the mechanisms used in the past water markets with well defined tradable rights have been proposed in many studies to manage demand and supply side fluctuations meran et al 2021 some studies suggest that when water is traded instead of being distributed in a fixed way the sustainability of the water resource and equity in the system are improved prieto 2021 bithas 2008 bakker 2001 in this spirit some countries have now institutionalized water markets water markets take both demand side and supply side measurements into account to increase water use efficiency and to handle drought like situations australia has set up the biggest water market in the world which is being used extensively to transfer water amongst users in the murray darling basin quiggin et al 2010 grafton et al 2014 similarly water markets are also operational in colorado and california usa for water markets to work properly clearly defined private water rights are essential murphy et al 2009 bakker 2011 water markets usually reward those who participate in trade but do not consider the spillover effects of the trade on individuals outside the market itself so a specific procedure for the compensation of these individuals needs to be introduced ostrom 1993 in developing economies such as pakistan this implies that water markets may lead towards further inequity and advantage of influential users in fact informal water markets that already exist in pakistan are known to be exploitative and unfair razzaq et al 2019 van steenbergen and oliemans 2002 therefore instead of trading water between individuals we consider a system in which water is allocated by a central planner or a regulator to meet individual demands while maximizing social welfare the central planner called in this paper as the principal agent also determines a fair cost using a type of auction based pricing mechanism this is only possible in a closed loop system in which principal agent take into account the actual water demand while allocating water among the users currently large irrigation networks around the world such as the indus basin irrigation system ibis in pakistan are managed as open loop systems cantoni et al 2007 an open loop agricultural water management awm system does not take into account the actual on farm crop water demand in ibis water is distributed at the canal command level using a strictly followed rotational roster scheme introduced under british colonial rule locally known as warabandi anwar et al 2016 during a rotation cycle each farmer receives water in fixed turns under this supply based water distribution mechanism each farmer gets a fixed amount of water depending upon its farm size shah et al 2016 this differs strikingly from demand based allocation mechanisms where water is supplied to farmers according to their demand siddiqi and wescoat 2013 finally irrigation systems are also complex socio ecological systems in which human behavior plays a significant role in mediating fair allocations konar et al 2019 therefore the objective of timely water delivery to varying crop water demands can not be met by a rigid open loop supply driven system here we present a demand driven closed loop system which takes the actual on farm demand into account in what follows we present a systems theory mechanism design based approach to improve the overall agricultural productivity by designing a system level policy for an efficient and fair distribution of surface water at the farm level the demand based water allocation scheme for the irrigation system is enabled using economic interventions and sensor technology the allocation is coupled with an auction based pricing mechanism a case study that is based over data sets taken from real field surveys is presented for validation of the proposed mechanism our results suggest that under certain realistic assumptions the proposed mechanism helps decrease groundwater pumping and conserve surface water in the process we have proposed a pricing scheme for the ibis in which undervaluing of water is a primary issue akram 2013 it is important to note that although the proposed scheme sets a price for the water the intention is not to maximize revenue of the central planner but to ensure productive use of surface water in a socially efficient manner in the proposed approach the demand can be met using surface water from an irrigation canal network regulated by a principal agent such as a regulatory authority in the face of a shortage the farmers resort to expensive pumping of non renewable groundwater to meet their demand a cropping season is divided into equal slots of fixed duration at the beginning of each time slot the principal agent solicits the valuations of the farmers and sorts the bids received from the users in decreasing order and starts fulfilling the demands from the top the central planner uses vickrey clarke groves vcg mechanism to compute the payments vickrey 1961 clarke 1971 groves et al 1973 the vcg designs payments in a way that motivates users to reveal their true valuation i e no benefit can be gained by misreporting varian and harris 2014 nisan and ronen 2007 social equity in water allocation is most easy to ensure via a central planner tedesco et al 2016 but the central planner needs true water demands to allocate water in equitable manner since vcg promotes true valuation it compels farmers to quantify their demands thus this is a step towards an effective demand based allocation system the remainder of the paper is divided into the following sections section 2 presents the irrigation model farm demand dynamics and warabandi distribution mechanism in ibis section 3 outlines the proposed water distribution and pricing mechanism section 4 explains the case study site and the monte carlo simulation for comparison between the warabandi mechanism and the proposed distribution mechanism the discussion on monte carlo simulation is in section 5 we conclude in section 6 2 system model dynamics in this section we first describe the indus basin irrigation system in which we evaluate our framework the water is supplied to the farms in the ibis using a supply based allocation mechanism the amount of water required at a farm depends upon soil moisture needs of the farm and cannot be serviced by supply based water allocation mechanism next we discuss the farm water demand dynamics followed by the discussion on currently practiced warabandi water allocation system in ibis 2 1 irrigation system large irrigation systems provide water to the agricultural lands through a large network of canals in the indus basin irrigation system ibis link canals transfer water from one river to another main primary canals take water directly from rivers dams or reservoirs branch canal is also a type of the main canal distributary secondary canals draw water from the main canals to feed minor tertiary canals minor canals feed water to watercourses watercourses are known as khalas in the local language watercourses can directly take water from main canals or distributary canals the farmers take water for their farms directly from the watercourses multiple farmers draw water from a single watercourse we assume there are n farms sharing a watercourse a schematic diagram of an irrigation system is given in fig 1 2 2 farm water demand the farm water demand depends upon soil moisture level of the farm the soil moisture level is defined as a percentage ratio of the volume of absorbed water to the total volume of the soil sample under observation water is applied to keep the soil moisture at a certain level so that the crop does not go under stress as part of the water pricing and distribution mechanism to be discussed in the next section we assume that soil moisture measurement is available at each farm 2 2 1 soil moisture dynamics now we discuss the soil moisture dynamics of a farm the soil moisture level is the ratio between the absorbed water volume and the total soil volume under consideration the soil moisture level depends upon inflows from surface water irrigation ground water pumping rainfall crop evapotranspiration and deep percolation the soil moisture level for farm n at time t is given by θ k t where n 1 2 3 n to avoid under and over irrigation the soil moisture level must stay within a pre defined range which depends upon soil properties this range is specified using upper and lower soil moisture level thresholds represented by θ n m a x 0 1 and θ n m i n 0 1 respectively with θ n m a x θ n m i n a moisture level above θ n m a x can hinder plant growth and production due to the seepage of the necessary nutrients below the root zone a moisture level below θ n m i n applies stress to the crop as in this case the plant has to draw water from a larger depth to get the maximum yield the farmer n has to retain soil moisture level θ n t within the interval θ n m a x θ n m i n the soil moisture dynamics of a farm are given as follows 1 θ n t i n t r n t e n t d n t we adopt this model from lozoya et al 2014 in practice farmers employ different affordable technologies to directly measure the soil moisture content however to obtain the progression of water demand we use the water balance equation 1 to simulate the dynamics of the soil moisture level i n t 0 is the water inflow through surface water irrigation or ground water pumping r n t 0 is the rain e n t 0 is the rate of water loss to crop evapotranspiration and d n t 0 is the rate of water loss to deep percolation more details about these terms are discussed by allen et al 1998 the scope of water balance models ranges from the global water cycle to soil moisture trends at the plant root level hussain 2019 furthermore water balance models are developed for varying complexity levels and different time scales e g yearly monthly daily and hourly mccabe and markstrom 2007 these models are used for many water related applications such as water supply water allocation flood estimation and waste water management boughton 2005 crop evapotranpiration is calculated by multiplying the reference evapotranpirtion et 0 t with crop coefficient k c t relationship of crop evapotranpiration e n t with crop coefficient and reference crop evapotranpiration is given as follows 2 e n t k c t e t 0 t the deep percolation rate depends upon soil moisture level when soil moisture level increases the percolation rate also increases due to the action of differential pressure ooi et al 2008 conversely the percolation rate decreases as the moisture level decreases this effect leads towards the proportional relationship between the soil moisture level and deep percolation this proportional relationship is used by several other studies including lozoya et al 2014 2016 saleem et al 2013 maheswararajah et al 2011 therefore we assume that the deep percolation rate is proportional to the soil moisture level i e d t c n θ n t where c n 0 is a deep percolation constant now the updated soil moisture equation is as follows 3 θ n t i n t r n t k c t e t 0 t c n θ n t in this model θ n t 0 1 t covers the entire physically realizable range of the moisture level fig 2 represents an illustrative trajectory of soil moisture level for a farm the upward spikes represent the application of water through surface irrigation groundwater pumping or rain when no water is applied the soil moisture level decays due to evapotranspiration and deep percolation 2 2 2 water demand model each farm n s instantaneous water demand is proportional to the farm size a n irrigation depth l n and difference between soil moisture level and maximum soil moisture level threshold which is represented by θ n m a x θ n t the factor θ n m a x θ n t shows the required increase in soil moisture level to keep moisture at the optimal level we represent the water demand of a farm n with d n t which can be calculated with the following equation 4 d n t β θ n m a x θ n t a n l n where β 1 is the irrigation coefficient β 1 means irrigation efficiency is 100 the higher values of β represents the irrigation inefficiency we assume that water demand is fulfilled either through surface water or groundwater water is applied to the farm either when surface water is available or when the soil moisture level θ n t reaches the minimum moisture level threshold θ n m i n i e θ n m i n θ n m i n in the former case the farmer has to pump groundwater to satisfy demand we assume groundwater is in abundance and the farmers can pump water according to their demand next we explain the water distribution mechanism practiced in the ibis for more than a century followed by our proposed water distribution mechanism 2 3 warabandi water distribution system water allocations in ibis occur at three different levels at the reservoir source or river among the main and distributary canals and among the farms at the watercourse level in this paper we will discuss water allocation mechanism at watercourse level because the central planner and user s interaction occurs at this level the mechanism of distributing water among farms along watercourses is known as warabandi wescoat et al 2018 it is a water distribution mechanism introduced in 1873 to distribute water among water users in the old punjab of present day southeast pakistan and northwest india under this mechanism water is divided among water users based on their farm size i e the proportion to their land in this mechanism each season is divided into cycles of fixed duration each cycle is of 7 days in some cases 10 1 2 days and during each cycle each farmer gets a fixed amount of water the value of unit irrigation time t u is the same for all farmers the unit irrigation time t u in hours per acre and a farmer s turn time t t for a weekly warabandi roster are as follows 5 t u 168 k 1 n t f n n 1 n t d n c t t t u a k t f n t d n where c is the cultivable command area of the watercourse i e the area that can be cultivated in the command area t f n is the total filling time t d n is the draining time and a n is the farm size zardari and cordery 2010 bandaragoda 1998 filling time or khal bharai in local jargon corresponds to the delay taken by the flow to fill the part of the watercourse directing towards the farm draining time or nikal in local language is the time for which a farm may keep getting water from the watercourse even when it is closed upstream and is diverted to the other farm a farmer s turn time can be converted into water volume received by the farmer by multiplying turn time with watercourse discharge capacity in the warabandi system water supply is conventionally determined as explained and does not take into account the actual on farm water demand if a farmer receives water less than on farm water demand the farmer either has to face low yield or invest in pumping groundwater water in the surplus of demand is unproductive and wasted in the form of run off in what follows we propose a demand based water distribution mechanism instead of distributing water in pre determined order to address precisely this inefficient water distribution issue 3 the demand based water distribution mechanism here we outline the framework for our proposed mechanism in the proposed approach each farmer is interested in buying a shared resource i e surface water the shared resource is regulated by a central planner or principal agent the entire season is divided into intervals of fixed duration t the interval t represents the time between subsequent irrigation decisions by farmers and the k th interval is k 1 t kt where k 0 1 2 3 at the beginning of each interval the principal agent solicits the valuations and demands of the players regarding the shared resource then based on the valuations and demands received by the principal and the availability of the shared resource the resource is distributed among the farmers in this section first we explain the bidding process from farmers perspective next we discuss the water allocation and pricing done by the principal agent 3 1 the bidding process at the start of each time interval k the principal agent asks the farmers for their valuation based on their valuations the farmers bid how much they value surface water during that time slot the bid of farmer n is b n tk and it includes how many units of water she needs and the price per unit of surface water that she is willing to pay for simplicity we use the shorthand notation b n k to represent b n kt similarly for other functions as well thus b n k is a pair i e b n k v ˆ n k d n k where v ˆ n k is how much farmer n claims to value a unit of surface water and d n k is the demand for farmer n the demand function d n k is the amount of water required in k th interval if this demand is not satisfied with the surface water farmer n will pump ground water to satisfy demand when moisture level θ n k is less than the minimum moisture level threshold θ n m i n i e θ n k θ n m i n the farmer can pump groundwater anywhere in the interval k whereas surface water is available to the farmers at the start of each interval k the actual valuation v n k of farmer n for surface water depends upon a number of factors that include groundwater pumping cost c g knapp et al 2018 current water demand d n k of the farm mallios and latinopoulos 2001 and farm size a n tang et al 2013 the valuation for farmer n at interval k is given as follows 6 v n k c g d n k a n it is important to note that v n k does not represent the actual bid of the farmer v ˆ n k which may be different 3 2 water allocation and pricing after receiving the bids from all farmers the principal agent decides how to divide water among the farmers and how much each farmer needs to pay for the water they receive here we explain the water allocation followed by a discussion on water pricing 3 2 1 water allocation to decide regarding the distribution of water the principal agent evaluates each farmer s willingness to pay p n k for water by computing 7 p n k v ˆ n k d n k next the principal orders the bids received from the farmers such that the highest bidder receives water with first priority next if there is still water left the principal agent provides water to the second highest bidder and this continues until all the surface water is divided among the farmers since the supply of surface water is variable and depends on a variety of parameters that include rainfall water supply from glacier melt governmental policies etc how many farmers actually receive water in k th interval cannot be known in advance the water distribution decision by the principal agent is represented by d k d 1 k d 2 k d n k based on the defined water distribution mechanism farmer n receives d n k units of water in the k th interval such that s min d n k d n k s min represents the minimum required amount of water flow in the watercourse to ensure water supply to a farmer the utility of farmer n in k th interval is u n k which is thus given as 8 u n d n k v n k d n k v n k d n k v n k d n k d n k where the factor d n k d n k is the unmet demand which farmer will have to meet by pumping groundwater if she does not receive the required amount of surface water from the principal 3 2 2 water pricing to compute the surface water payments of farmers the vcg vickrey clarke groves mechanism is used we represent the payments by c n v ˆ n k v ˆ n k to calculate payments based on vcg mechanism the principal agent computes d k and d n k for each farmer n where d k is the social decision vector by principal i e how much surface water each farmer was allocated in k th interval and d n k is the hypothetical social decision vector i e how much water would have been allocated to each farmer if farmer n did not participate in the bidding process next the payment of each farmer n in k th interval is computed as follows 9 c n v ˆ n k v ˆ n k j n u j d j n k v ˆ j k d j k j n u j d k v ˆ j k d j k payment of a farmer n in 9 is the difference between social utilities of other farmers in the absence of farmer n and social utilities of other farmers in the presence of farmer n this method of computing payments takes into account the social impact of a farmer participation in the bidding process note that in the bidding c n v ˆ n k v ˆ n k 0 if d n k 0 i e a farmer n who did not receive surface water in k th interval will not have to pay next we explain the payments for farmers who receive surface water in the interval k a farmers payment is according to her social impact on other farmers as it depends upon other farmers bid let n 1 n 2 n o is an indexing of farmers such that p n 1 k p n 2 k p n i p n o k where p n i k is willingness to pay for water as defined in 7 this indexing classifies the farmers in the decreasing order of priority to get a portion of water from the available surface water supply let the surface water supply be such that the first m farmers in the decreasing order of priority receive water i e d n l k 0 for 1 l m the water allocation mechanism and the decision d k by the principal agent makes sure that the water demand of the first m 1 farmers is fully satisfied and farmer n m receives a portion of surface water which is less than her total demand i e 10 d n l k d n l k 1 l m 1 d ˆ l m where d ˆ is the surface water received by the farmer n m such that s min d ˆ d n m k to calculate the payment of the farmer n l we need to determine d n l k among the m farmers getting water in the k th interval the bid of farmer n l will only influence the farmer n m whose water demand was not fully satisfied the farmers n 1 n l 1 n l 1 n m 1 will yet receive surface water equal to their demand whether n l participates in the bidding process or not thus 11 u j d n l k v ˆ n j k u j d k v ˆ n j k 0 for all j 1 i 1 i 1 m 1 if farmer n l did not take part in the bidding d n l k extra units of surface water are available for other farmers therefore the amount of surface water received by farmer n m will certainly increase let d n m n l k represent the quantity of surface water received by farmer n m if farmer n l did not take part in the bidding then 12 d n m n l k d n m k d n l k d n m k d n m k d n m k d n l k otherwise thus if d n l k is adequate then the water demand of farmer n m will be entirely fulfilled furthermore if d n l k d n m k d n m k s min then farmers who did not initially receive water may obtain water let the quantity d n l k be adequate to not only fulfil the water demand of farmer n m but p extra farmers as well i e n m 1 n m 2 n m p also receive water in the case in which farmer n l did not take part in the bidding the utilities of farmers n m k m 1 n m p will increased thus the payment for farmer n l will be as follows 13 c n l v ˆ n k v ˆ n k j n m n m p u j d n l k v ˆ j k u j d k v ˆ j k 4 results in this section we present a case study to compare the performance of the proposed water distribution mechanism with the warabandi distribution mechanism practiced conventionally in the ibis we use the past data to form initial models of soil moisture dynamics next we incorporate the collected data in our pricing and allocation scheme to compared it with the currently used water distribution mechanisms in the study region in particular and the indus basin irrigation system in general first we evaluate performance for nominal parameters in the case study area followed by exhaustive numerical simulations to compare both water distribution mechanisms over the physically realizable range of parameters we find that the proposed distribution mechanism performs better than the round robin warabandi system in terms of surface water use and groundwater pumping 4 1 study area area irrigated by watercourse 91093 l located at moza joyia in central punjab pakistan is chosen as the case study site as shown in fig 3 this watercourse is connected with the gogera branch canal the gogera branch canal is a distributary canal that is 137 km in length it is being fed from lbdc lower bari doab canal lbdc is the 201 km long main canal accompanied by 2264 km of distributary canals which irrigate 700 000 ha of land in central punjab pakistan it draws water from the balloki barrage located on river ravi the ravi river is a 720 km long trans boundary river that passes through eastern pakistan after crossing northwestern india it is one of the major rivers of the indus basin the watercourse at the case study site irrigates 444 43 acres of land and the length of this watercourse is 4548 m this watercourse has 49 nakkas in the watercourse nakka is a cut through which water goes directly into fields major crops in the study area are maize sugarcane cotton rice and sorghum there are 24 farmers in the study area and each farmer owns a portion of the land in this area the proportion of land owned by each farmer and watercourse location is shown in fig 4 each farm number area number farm area farm irrigation time draining time filling time net allotted time initial timing and final timing are provided in warabandi roster warabandi roster along the watercourse of our study area is shown in table 2 note that we collected the data at the case study site during the kharif crops autumn crop growth period july to october in 2018 4 2 calculation of model parameters in this section we discuss the methods equations and data resources used to compare performance of the proposed water distribution mechanism with the warabandi distribution mechanism first we discuss the parameters used to calculate the soil moisture dynamics which include crop coefficients reference evapotranspiration deep percolation constant maximum and minimum soil moisture threshold and precipitation at the end we explain the irrigation depth which is used to measure farm water demand 4 2 1 crop coefficient crop coefficient k c t is used in calculating evapotranpirtion as shown in equation 2 several studies elghandour et al 2019 jayanthi et al 2001 irmak et al 2011 show that remote sensing based techniques can be used to measure crop coefficient crop coefficient k c t and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi t have a linear relationship trout and johnson 2007 d urso 2010 a simple linear relationship between k c t and ndvi t is as follows 14 k c t 1 457 n d v i t 0 01725 we adopt this model from kamble et al 2013 we have used the time series sentinel 2 10 m 10 m resolution data to derive ndvi t near infrared and red bands of the data are used to measure ndvi t the ndvi t is given by 15 n d v i t n i r r n i r r where r is the reflectance in the red and nir is the reflectance in the near infrared region of the spectrum data was collected from july 2018 to october 2018 during this time period at different time steps the crop coefficient in our study area is shown in fig 5 the average crop coefficient at the start of the season is low representing less vegetation and crop coefficient values in september high crop coefficient values show the high cropping intensity in the area near the end of the season crop coefficient values start gradually decreasing which shows harvesting of the crop 4 2 2 reference evapotranpirtion reference evapotranspiration et o t data were collected from the usgs fews net data sharing services usgs 2020b the spatial resolution of the data is 1 km 1 km there are five pixels of reference evapotranspiration et o t data that overlap with our study area the pixel area overlapping with our study area is shown in fig 6 monthly reference evapotranspiration et o t values in each pixel of fig 6 are given in table 1 the crop evapotranspiration in equation 2 is calculated by multiplying the reference evapotranpiration et 0 t with crop coefficient k c t the spatial resolution of crop coefficient k c t is 10 m 10 m in order to match the spatial resolution of k c t and et 0 t we have assumed that reference evapotranspiration et o t value is the same for all 10 m 10 m pixel which are part of a 1 km 1 km pixel of et o t hence the crop evapotranspiration e n t spatial resolution is 10 m 10 m 4 2 3 precipitation precipitation r n t data was collected from the data portal developed by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing chrs 2020a we have used data with daily temporal resolution and its spatial resolution is 4 km 4 km the rainfall data in our study area is presented in fig 7 4 2 4 deep percolation constant we have installed a soil moisture sensor in our study area data coming from this sensor is used to calculate the deep percolation constant c n at this point in the study area the c n value at this point in the study area is 0 15 10 4 deep percolation constant depends upon soil type we have assumed a small random variation in the calculated value measured from the installed sensor to calculate the deep percolation constant values at other farms the deep percolation constant value for each farm is selected from the range 0 5 104 2 104 using a uniform random distribution and this range covers almost all types of soils in the study area 4 2 5 irrigation depth irrigation depth l n is used to calculate water demand of a farm as shown in equation 4 it depends upon the soil type and root depth of the crop soil type in our study area is loamy major crops in our case study area are alfalfa maize cotton sugarcane sorghum potatoes and wheat these type of crops have deep rooting zone we estimate the irrigation depth using a method described by brouwer et al 1989 estimated irrigation depth in our case study area is 100 mm 4 3 simulation in this section we compare the performance of the proposed water distribution mechanism with traditional warabandi distribution mechanism in our study area we assess performance of the proposed mechanism based on the amount of extra groundwater pumped and the amount of surface water wasted our goal is to compare both mechanisms over physically realizable range of parameters before presenting the results of monte carlo simulation first we illustrate the results with nominal parameters then we present the monte carlo simulation in the end we present interesting cases from monte carlo simulations 4 3 1 simulation setup there are a total of twenty four farmers i e n 24 we evaluate performance for a single cropping season of approximately four months july 2018 to october 2018 and seventeen weeks the maximum and minimum moisture level threshold depends upon the soil type the study area is small and the soil type is the same throughout the area we assume constant maximum and minimum moisture level thresholds so that θ n m a x 0 25 and θ n m i n 0 10 respectively for all farms the initial condition θ n 0 for each farm is randomly chosen from the interval 0 10 0 25 using a uniform random distribution the design capacity of the study area watercourse is not available we assume that study area watercourse design capacity is equivalent to the design capacity of the watercourse adjacent to our study area as area irrigated by both watercourses is approximately equal the design capacity of the adjacent watercourse is 1 6 106 cusec week on farm water management 2017 in pakistan the average canal efficiency is 75 frenken et al 2012 thus only 75 of the watercourse design capacity water reaches the watercourse i e 1 2 106 cusec week under the proposed mechanism each farmer computes the water demand and declares a bid at the start of each week the farmers fulfill their water requirements through groundwater pumping if surface water is insufficient to meet their demand the groundwater cost in our study area is c g 0 10 pkr the farmers may also pump groundwater during the week if the soil moisture level θ n t reaches the lower threshold θ n m i n i e θ n t θ n m i n in the warabandi mechanism the water is distributed among farmers using a roster shown in table 2 this warabandi roster is rotational and repeats each week 4 3 2 performance evaluation for nominal parameters we evaluate surface water wasted the difference in pumped water and the difference in cost incurred by farmers to compare the proposed mechanism with the warabandi mechanism for a nominal set of parameters the surface water supply each week is shown in fig 8 each farm soil moisture level over the entire season is shown in fig 9 water demand and the surface water received at the start of the week by each farmer when water is distributed through the proposed mechanism and warabandi mechanism are shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively the surface water received and groundwater pumped in the proposed mechanism are shown in fig 12 in figs 10 and 11 water demand for all farmers in week 3 is almost zero water demand is zero in this week due to rain although water demand is zero in this week farmers are receiving water in the warabandi mechanism in the proposed mechanism water is not being supplied to farmers with zero demand since water is provided to farmers depending upon their demand in warabandi mechanism farmers are receiving water irrespective of their demand farmers 1 4 and 5 are receiving more water compared to other farmers in the proposed mechanism fig 12 shows that farmer 1 4 and 5 are not pumping groundwater throughout the season except in week 6 the soil moisture level of farmer 1 4 and 5 reaches the minimum moisture threshold at the end of the week thus at the start of each week their demand is higher and they bid for water at a higher price consequently getting water at a high priority all other farmers moisture level touches the minimum moisture level threshold during the week thus all other farmers have to fulfill their demand during the week through groundwater pumping farmers cannot wait for the surface water supply at the start of the week as the surface water supply is uncertain in the study area in the proposed mechanism if a farmer s water demand and per unit of water bidding price is small compared to other farmers the farmer may not get water or get water less than the demand for example in week 12 farmer 19 s water demand is less than other farmers so she did not receive water that week the surface water bidding price per acre and charged price per acre in pkr are shown in fig 13 the bidding price is always greater or equal to the charged price farmers are getting charges for surface water in week 1 5 7 and 12 farmers are not getting charged for surface water when water available is greater than the total demand of all farmers because the procedure of farmer s payment calculation considers the social impact of a farmer on other farmers when water available is greater than the total water demand of all farmers there is no social impact of a farmer on others fig 14 shows the weekly difference in total water pumped the difference in total surface water used and difference in total cost incurred by all farmers combined when water is distributed through warabandi distribution mechanism compared to proposed allocation mechanism in the study area a positive difference in total water pumped indicates more pumping in the warabandi case the difference is almost zero during a few weeks groundwater pumped is almost equal during these weeks in both distribution mechanism fig 14 also shows the difference in surface water used per week between the warabandi distribution mechanism and the proposed allocation mechanism a positive difference indicates more water is being used in the warabandi mechanism compared to the proposed mechanism in the warabandi distribution mechanism if the water received is more than demand farmers do not use extra surface water resulting in wastage in the form of run off farmers do not receive excess water in the proposed mechanism since water is supplied according to their demand fig 14 also represents the weekly difference in the total cost incurred by all farmers combined between the warabandi distribution mechanism and proposed allocation mechanism a positive difference indicates farmers are incurring more costs in the warabandi mechanism a negative difference indicates more cost is being incurred in the proposed mechanism in the proposed mechanism surface water price is always less than groundwater price since farmers willingness to pay for surface water is less or equal to groundwater price in the warabandi mechanism surface water price is a fixed one time cost in a season and is negligible compared to groundwater pumping price the cost incurred by farmers in week 1 5 7 and 12 is negative since surface water price in these weeks is non zero surface water price is non zero in week 1 5 7 and 12 for most of the farmers and zero during other weeks as shown in fig 13 in the proposed mechanism the surface water payment for a farmer is non zero when surface water is scarce i e the surface water supply is not enough to fulfill all farmers water demand the proposed pricing mechanism charges farmers according to their social impact on others it does not charge farmers when water is in abundance since water usage by a farmer does not affect water availability for other farmers the positive cost difference in week 2 6 10 13 14 and 16 indicates that the groundwater pumping cost combined with surface water cost in the proposed mechanism is less than the groundwater pumping cost in the warabandi mechanism it also suggests that more water is being pumped in the warabandi mechanism in these weeks zero difference means an equal amount of groundwater is being pumped and surface water cost in the proposed mechanism is zero the comparison results indicate that the proposed mechanism performs much better than the warabandi mechanism in terms of water efficiency since less water is being pumped and there is no surface water wastage in the proposed mechanism in the proposed mechanism the weekly cost incurred by farmers is low compared to warabandi mechanism when farmers are pumping lower amount of water and surface water is enough to meet farmers demand the cost incurred by farmers is higher in the proposed mechanism when surface water available is less than the total water demand of the farmers 4 3 3 monte carlo simulations next to compare both mechanisms over the physically realizable extent of the parameter space we perform repetitive numerical simulations by randomly varying the model parameters over a range that impersonates real world behavior we analyze the difference in total water pumped the difference in total surface water used and total difference in cost incurred to compare both mechanisms while randomly varying the surface water supply deep percolation constant crop coefficient and rain amount over the physically realizable range the maximum available surface water in the study area watercourse is 1 6 106 cusec surface water supply range is 0 1 6 106 cusec the deep percolation constant c k range is 0 5 10 4 2 10 4 and this range covers almost all types of soils in our study area the crop coefficient k c t and reference evapotranspiration et o t are chosen randomly from the data set given by ullah et al 2001 for the study area the daily rain data of the past 21 years was obtained from data portal developed by nasa anon 2021 the daily rain in the simulation is chosen randomly from 21 given samples the initial condition θ k 0 for each farmer is chosen through uniform distribution over an interval 0 10 0 25 we have repeated these simulations 1 104 times fig 15 shows the total difference in water pumped the surface water used and cost incurred by farmers when water is distributed through warabandi mechanism compared to the proposed mechanism the positive difference in water pumped represents that more water is being pumped in the warabandi mechanism compared to the proposed mechanism the average difference in pumped water is positive because farmers get water in the warabandi mechanism regardless of their demand farmers have to pump water if water received by a farmer is less than her demand to fulfill its water requirements therefore on average farmers have to pump more water in the warabandi mechanism than the proposed mechanism the positive difference in surface water wasted shows that more water is being used in the warabandi mechanism than the proposed mechanism in the warabandi mechanism when the water received by a farmer is greater than her demand the extra water gets wasted in the form of run off the negative difference in the total cost represents that farmers are incurring more costs in the proposed mechanism in the proposed mechanism the principal agent charges farmers for surface water when water is scarce while in the warabandi mechanism farmers pay a negligible cost once in a season the general results of monte carlo simulations demonstrate a better performance through our approach but there are some anomalies in the monte carlo simulation the difference in groundwater pumping is negative for a small number of cases this negative difference represents more groundwater pumping in the proposed mechanism the negative difference in cost shows more cost is being incurred in the proposed mechanism these anomalies do not disaffirm the proposed mechanism as we will explore these exceptions in the next section 5 discussion in this paper we have compared the performance of the proposed mechanism with warabandi mechanism we evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism based on the amount of water pumped amount of surface water wastage and cost incurred by farmers in the monte carlo simulation the general conclusion about performance of the proposed mechanism holds for majority of the cases over the realistic parameter values despite these results some exceptions exist but these exceptions happen only in a minority of cases even in these minority of exceptions less surface water is being used in the proposed mechanism groundwater pumping in the proposed mechanism compared to warabandi mechanism is higher in a minority of cases for groundwater pumping we explore the worst case encountered in the monte carlo simulation in the worst case the total groundwater pumped difference is 1 601 106 cusec throughout the season when water is distributed using the warabandi mechanism compared to the proposed mechanism the negative sign represents more groundwater is being pumped in the proposed mechanism in this case farmers are pumping extra water in the proposed mechanism because the water demand is high and the surface water supply is scarce the surface water supply is less than the demand in most of the weeks throughout the season as shown in fig 17 in case of scarcity the proposed mechanism provides water to the farmers who value it the most therefore in case of scarcity other farmers have to pump groundwater to fulfill their demand even in the worst case the overall water usage groundwater and surface water is less in the proposed mechanism the difference in water usage per week for this case is shown in fig 16 farmers use less water groundwater and surface water throughout the season except in weeks 2 6 10 and 13 overall farmers are using less water in the proposed mechanism in the monte carlo simulations the cost incurred by farmers is greater most of the time in the proposed mechanism this does not go against the intention of the proposed mechanism which was fair pricing and allocation of water even then a lot of cases occur with cost saving because the proposed mechanism does not charge for water when the water supply is greater than water demand and less groundwater pumping leads towards cost saving in the proposed mechanism for cost incurred by farmers we explore the worst case encountered in the monte carlo simulation in the worst case the difference in the total cost incurred by farmers is 8 56 105 pkr throughout the season when water is distributed using warabandi mechanism compared to the proposed mechanism the negative sign represents that the higher cost is being incurred in the proposed mechanism this higher cost in the proposed mechanism is because of the higher water demand compared to the surface water supply for this case the water demand and surface water supply throughout the season is given in the fig 18 the cost incurred by farmers is higher when the surface water supply is scarce the proposed mechanism charges farmers when the surface water supply is scarce our results show that the proposed mechanism leads to a more efficient utilization of surface water and a corresponding reduction in wastage similar effects have been observed in real world cases naghdi et al 2021 kadi and ziyad 2018 fu et al 2018 where demand based allocation schemes have led to better utilization of surface irrigation water groundwater depletion is posing threat to global food and water security famiglietti 2014 wada et al 2010 we have demonstrated that the groundwater usage has reduced when surface water is distributed through the proposed mechanism similar results can be seen in studies zeinali et al 2020 tian et al 2015 where efficient distribution of surface water led towards sustainable groundwater usage undervaluation of water has been a significant challenge in ensuring fairness in irrigation systems around the world du et al 2010 lahsen et al 2016 munguía lópez et al 2019 the second price auction that we propose has been shown to guarantee truthful valuation on behalf of the bidders easley et al 2010 both in theory and in practical settings nisan and ronen 2007 varian and harris 2014 furthermore the vcg mechanism that lies at the heart of our approach ensures a fair pricing scheme by taking into account the social impact of a user on other users vcg is widely used in other related settings as well hobbs et al 2000 samadi et al 2012 langbort 2012 tanaka and gupta 2016 where it provides an attractive market model by attaining zero efficiency loss and individual rationality shoham and leyton brown 2008 6 conclusion this paper discusses a demand based surface water distribution mechanism the proposed mechanism s objective is to distribute surface water among farmers in a socially optimal manner while decreasing surface water wastage and groundwater pumping the mechanism promotes truthful reporting of water valuation by farmers through a case study conducted at a watercourse in ibis we have exhibited that the farmers pump less water when water is distributed using the proposed mechanism compared to the traditional warabandi system in ibis assuring a more sustainable future for groundwater resources we also see that under the proposed mechanism there is no surface water wastage as farmers are getting surface water as per their demand compared to the warabandi mechanism in the warabandi mechanism a fixed among of water is supplied to farmers irrespective of their demand in the proposed mechanism farmers weekly water costs are low compared to the warabandi mechanism when the surface water supply is enough to fulfill all farmers demands at the start of the week and farmers pump less groundwater throughout the week in the case of surface water abundance the proposed pricing mechanisms do not charge for water as the net social impact of a farmer using surface water is zero on other farmers in the case of scarcity the proposed mechanism charges a farmer according to her water usage impact on other farmers water supply the weekly water costs incurred by farmers are high when surface water is scarce although the approach has been demonstrated for a specific region in the indus basin the technique is generic and applicable to other regions as well lastly we hope that this study serves as a small step towards solving an

9925,global climate change has effected the snow covers and precipitation patterns leading to unreliable surface water availability for agricultural usage many studies suggest that demand based surface water management instead of supply based management may significantly mitigate the problem of supply side fluctuations such management schemes have now been brought to the forefront due to the recent advances in information and communication technologies icts in the absence of a demand based water distribution mechanism in the indus basin irrigation network inequity and unreliability feature prominently this research contributes to addressing these problems by proposing a demand driven allocation scheme for surface water coupled with an auction based pricing mechanism we compare the proposed scheme with the currently practiced water distribution mechanism in ibis indus basin irrigation system by conducting a pilot study whose site is located in central punjab pakistan our simulations suggest that under certain realistic assumptions the proposed mechanism leads to a more efficient allocation of surface water resulting in lower exploitation of groundwater resources and potentially higher agricultural yield due to improved water availability graphical abstract ga1 keywords farm level water management irrigation distribution system surface water management 1 introduction water is an essential common pool resource cpr that is important for life on earth and sustains agriculture for human societies water scarcity and fluctuations are increasing in many parts of the world due to climate change population and economic growth gleick 2018 distefano and kelly 2017 in recent years water quality is deteriorating in several countries causing a threat to food security in these countries and increasing concern for further water availability boyd 2019 it is therefore necessary that the existing water resources be distributed among users more efficiently in the agriculture sector the low profit and large losses of water have served as an argument for efficient agricultural water management irrigated agriculture now occupies 20 of the total cultivated land globally fao 2010 however the feasibility of new irrigation projects to ensure food security is questionable given the increasing agitation over the negative consequences of large infrastructures dams reservoirs land losses due to salinization huang et al 2018 and efficiency related paradoxes grafton et al 2018 reforms in water related policies are considered one of the most effective instruments available to enhance water efficiency johansson et al 2002 in this context the nobel prize winner elinor ostrom has identified concrete design principals to craft institutions for long enduring irrigation systems which include monitoring and efficient allocation of water ostrom 1993 therefore among the many different aspects of an irrigation system water allocation related policies are essential during the last decade the farming sector has seen the introduction of sensing and control technologies that have the potential to improve the information accessibility of farmers leading towards efficient use of water resources galioto et al 2020 lack of use of information and communication based technologies in the agriculture sector is a major problem as it increases pressure on water resources and contributes to unsustainable agricultural practices due to uncertain information environment nakasone and torero 2016 the information led technologies and value of information concepts have been used in numerous fields e g engineering economics medicine and finance but this concept has seldom been used in the agriculture sector galioto et al 2020 here we leverage the availability of such technologies to formulate a water allocation mechanism in this mechanism users make decisions using information provided by ict based sensing technologies the allocation of water and the objectives of water related policies can be obtained through several allocation mechanisms water distribution mechanisms range from fully centralized control by the government to completely decentralized water markets dinar et al 2015 past literature that investigates water allocation and pricing mechanisms worldwide include dinar and subramanian 1998 jones 2000 johansson et al 2002 tsur et al 2004a 2004b dinar and mody 2004 molle and berkoff 2007 these studies compare the efficiency among different water allocation and pricing mechanisms and compare the experiences and policies in the global setting the conclusion of these and other related studies is that no single type of water allocation and pricing mechanism is optimal in all contexts therefore there is no best practice that can be suggested to one country or region dinar et al 2015 water users in various countries and regions face different problems and needs for water allocation and pricing mechanisms furthermore future water scarcity produced by climate change will most likely lead to different water allocation and pricing needs than those addressed by the mechanisms used in the past water markets with well defined tradable rights have been proposed in many studies to manage demand and supply side fluctuations meran et al 2021 some studies suggest that when water is traded instead of being distributed in a fixed way the sustainability of the water resource and equity in the system are improved prieto 2021 bithas 2008 bakker 2001 in this spirit some countries have now institutionalized water markets water markets take both demand side and supply side measurements into account to increase water use efficiency and to handle drought like situations australia has set up the biggest water market in the world which is being used extensively to transfer water amongst users in the murray darling basin quiggin et al 2010 grafton et al 2014 similarly water markets are also operational in colorado and california usa for water markets to work properly clearly defined private water rights are essential murphy et al 2009 bakker 2011 water markets usually reward those who participate in trade but do not consider the spillover effects of the trade on individuals outside the market itself so a specific procedure for the compensation of these individuals needs to be introduced ostrom 1993 in developing economies such as pakistan this implies that water markets may lead towards further inequity and advantage of influential users in fact informal water markets that already exist in pakistan are known to be exploitative and unfair razzaq et al 2019 van steenbergen and oliemans 2002 therefore instead of trading water between individuals we consider a system in which water is allocated by a central planner or a regulator to meet individual demands while maximizing social welfare the central planner called in this paper as the principal agent also determines a fair cost using a type of auction based pricing mechanism this is only possible in a closed loop system in which principal agent take into account the actual water demand while allocating water among the users currently large irrigation networks around the world such as the indus basin irrigation system ibis in pakistan are managed as open loop systems cantoni et al 2007 an open loop agricultural water management awm system does not take into account the actual on farm crop water demand in ibis water is distributed at the canal command level using a strictly followed rotational roster scheme introduced under british colonial rule locally known as warabandi anwar et al 2016 during a rotation cycle each farmer receives water in fixed turns under this supply based water distribution mechanism each farmer gets a fixed amount of water depending upon its farm size shah et al 2016 this differs strikingly from demand based allocation mechanisms where water is supplied to farmers according to their demand siddiqi and wescoat 2013 finally irrigation systems are also complex socio ecological systems in which human behavior plays a significant role in mediating fair allocations konar et al 2019 therefore the objective of timely water delivery to varying crop water demands can not be met by a rigid open loop supply driven system here we present a demand driven closed loop system which takes the actual on farm demand into account in what follows we present a systems theory mechanism design based approach to improve the overall agricultural productivity by designing a system level policy for an efficient and fair distribution of surface water at the farm level the demand based water allocation scheme for the irrigation system is enabled using economic interventions and sensor technology the allocation is coupled with an auction based pricing mechanism a case study that is based over data sets taken from real field surveys is presented for validation of the proposed mechanism our results suggest that under certain realistic assumptions the proposed mechanism helps decrease groundwater pumping and conserve surface water in the process we have proposed a pricing scheme for the ibis in which undervaluing of water is a primary issue akram 2013 it is important to note that although the proposed scheme sets a price for the water the intention is not to maximize revenue of the central planner but to ensure productive use of surface water in a socially efficient manner in the proposed approach the demand can be met using surface water from an irrigation canal network regulated by a principal agent such as a regulatory authority in the face of a shortage the farmers resort to expensive pumping of non renewable groundwater to meet their demand a cropping season is divided into equal slots of fixed duration at the beginning of each time slot the principal agent solicits the valuations of the farmers and sorts the bids received from the users in decreasing order and starts fulfilling the demands from the top the central planner uses vickrey clarke groves vcg mechanism to compute the payments vickrey 1961 clarke 1971 groves et al 1973 the vcg designs payments in a way that motivates users to reveal their true valuation i e no benefit can be gained by misreporting varian and harris 2014 nisan and ronen 2007 social equity in water allocation is most easy to ensure via a central planner tedesco et al 2016 but the central planner needs true water demands to allocate water in equitable manner since vcg promotes true valuation it compels farmers to quantify their demands thus this is a step towards an effective demand based allocation system the remainder of the paper is divided into the following sections section 2 presents the irrigation model farm demand dynamics and warabandi distribution mechanism in ibis section 3 outlines the proposed water distribution and pricing mechanism section 4 explains the case study site and the monte carlo simulation for comparison between the warabandi mechanism and the proposed distribution mechanism the discussion on monte carlo simulation is in section 5 we conclude in section 6 2 system model dynamics in this section we first describe the indus basin irrigation system in which we evaluate our framework the water is supplied to the farms in the ibis using a supply based allocation mechanism the amount of water required at a farm depends upon soil moisture needs of the farm and cannot be serviced by supply based water allocation mechanism next we discuss the farm water demand dynamics followed by the discussion on currently practiced warabandi water allocation system in ibis 2 1 irrigation system large irrigation systems provide water to the agricultural lands through a large network of canals in the indus basin irrigation system ibis link canals transfer water from one river to another main primary canals take water directly from rivers dams or reservoirs branch canal is also a type of the main canal distributary secondary canals draw water from the main canals to feed minor tertiary canals minor canals feed water to watercourses watercourses are known as khalas in the local language watercourses can directly take water from main canals or distributary canals the farmers take water for their farms directly from the watercourses multiple farmers draw water from a single watercourse we assume there are n farms sharing a watercourse a schematic diagram of an irrigation system is given in fig 1 2 2 farm water demand the farm water demand depends upon soil moisture level of the farm the soil moisture level is defined as a percentage ratio of the volume of absorbed water to the total volume of the soil sample under observation water is applied to keep the soil moisture at a certain level so that the crop does not go under stress as part of the water pricing and distribution mechanism to be discussed in the next section we assume that soil moisture measurement is available at each farm 2 2 1 soil moisture dynamics now we discuss the soil moisture dynamics of a farm the soil moisture level is the ratio between the absorbed water volume and the total soil volume under consideration the soil moisture level depends upon inflows from surface water irrigation ground water pumping rainfall crop evapotranspiration and deep percolation the soil moisture level for farm n at time t is given by θ k t where n 1 2 3 n to avoid under and over irrigation the soil moisture level must stay within a pre defined range which depends upon soil properties this range is specified using upper and lower soil moisture level thresholds represented by θ n m a x 0 1 and θ n m i n 0 1 respectively with θ n m a x θ n m i n a moisture level above θ n m a x can hinder plant growth and production due to the seepage of the necessary nutrients below the root zone a moisture level below θ n m i n applies stress to the crop as in this case the plant has to draw water from a larger depth to get the maximum yield the farmer n has to retain soil moisture level θ n t within the interval θ n m a x θ n m i n the soil moisture dynamics of a farm are given as follows 1 θ n t i n t r n t e n t d n t we adopt this model from lozoya et al 2014 in practice farmers employ different affordable technologies to directly measure the soil moisture content however to obtain the progression of water demand we use the water balance equation 1 to simulate the dynamics of the soil moisture level i n t 0 is the water inflow through surface water irrigation or ground water pumping r n t 0 is the rain e n t 0 is the rate of water loss to crop evapotranspiration and d n t 0 is the rate of water loss to deep percolation more details about these terms are discussed by allen et al 1998 the scope of water balance models ranges from the global water cycle to soil moisture trends at the plant root level hussain 2019 furthermore water balance models are developed for varying complexity levels and different time scales e g yearly monthly daily and hourly mccabe and markstrom 2007 these models are used for many water related applications such as water supply water allocation flood estimation and waste water management boughton 2005 crop evapotranpiration is calculated by multiplying the reference evapotranpirtion et 0 t with crop coefficient k c t relationship of crop evapotranpiration e n t with crop coefficient and reference crop evapotranpiration is given as follows 2 e n t k c t e t 0 t the deep percolation rate depends upon soil moisture level when soil moisture level increases the percolation rate also increases due to the action of differential pressure ooi et al 2008 conversely the percolation rate decreases as the moisture level decreases this effect leads towards the proportional relationship between the soil moisture level and deep percolation this proportional relationship is used by several other studies including lozoya et al 2014 2016 saleem et al 2013 maheswararajah et al 2011 therefore we assume that the deep percolation rate is proportional to the soil moisture level i e d t c n θ n t where c n 0 is a deep percolation constant now the updated soil moisture equation is as follows 3 θ n t i n t r n t k c t e t 0 t c n θ n t in this model θ n t 0 1 t covers the entire physically realizable range of the moisture level fig 2 represents an illustrative trajectory of soil moisture level for a farm the upward spikes represent the application of water through surface irrigation groundwater pumping or rain when no water is applied the soil moisture level decays due to evapotranspiration and deep percolation 2 2 2 water demand model each farm n s instantaneous water demand is proportional to the farm size a n irrigation depth l n and difference between soil moisture level and maximum soil moisture level threshold which is represented by θ n m a x θ n t the factor θ n m a x θ n t shows the required increase in soil moisture level to keep moisture at the optimal level we represent the water demand of a farm n with d n t which can be calculated with the following equation 4 d n t β θ n m a x θ n t a n l n where β 1 is the irrigation coefficient β 1 means irrigation efficiency is 100 the higher values of β represents the irrigation inefficiency we assume that water demand is fulfilled either through surface water or groundwater water is applied to the farm either when surface water is available or when the soil moisture level θ n t reaches the minimum moisture level threshold θ n m i n i e θ n m i n θ n m i n in the former case the farmer has to pump groundwater to satisfy demand we assume groundwater is in abundance and the farmers can pump water according to their demand next we explain the water distribution mechanism practiced in the ibis for more than a century followed by our proposed water distribution mechanism 2 3 warabandi water distribution system water allocations in ibis occur at three different levels at the reservoir source or river among the main and distributary canals and among the farms at the watercourse level in this paper we will discuss water allocation mechanism at watercourse level because the central planner and user s interaction occurs at this level the mechanism of distributing water among farms along watercourses is known as warabandi wescoat et al 2018 it is a water distribution mechanism introduced in 1873 to distribute water among water users in the old punjab of present day southeast pakistan and northwest india under this mechanism water is divided among water users based on their farm size i e the proportion to their land in this mechanism each season is divided into cycles of fixed duration each cycle is of 7 days in some cases 10 1 2 days and during each cycle each farmer gets a fixed amount of water the value of unit irrigation time t u is the same for all farmers the unit irrigation time t u in hours per acre and a farmer s turn time t t for a weekly warabandi roster are as follows 5 t u 168 k 1 n t f n n 1 n t d n c t t t u a k t f n t d n where c is the cultivable command area of the watercourse i e the area that can be cultivated in the command area t f n is the total filling time t d n is the draining time and a n is the farm size zardari and cordery 2010 bandaragoda 1998 filling time or khal bharai in local jargon corresponds to the delay taken by the flow to fill the part of the watercourse directing towards the farm draining time or nikal in local language is the time for which a farm may keep getting water from the watercourse even when it is closed upstream and is diverted to the other farm a farmer s turn time can be converted into water volume received by the farmer by multiplying turn time with watercourse discharge capacity in the warabandi system water supply is conventionally determined as explained and does not take into account the actual on farm water demand if a farmer receives water less than on farm water demand the farmer either has to face low yield or invest in pumping groundwater water in the surplus of demand is unproductive and wasted in the form of run off in what follows we propose a demand based water distribution mechanism instead of distributing water in pre determined order to address precisely this inefficient water distribution issue 3 the demand based water distribution mechanism here we outline the framework for our proposed mechanism in the proposed approach each farmer is interested in buying a shared resource i e surface water the shared resource is regulated by a central planner or principal agent the entire season is divided into intervals of fixed duration t the interval t represents the time between subsequent irrigation decisions by farmers and the k th interval is k 1 t kt where k 0 1 2 3 at the beginning of each interval the principal agent solicits the valuations and demands of the players regarding the shared resource then based on the valuations and demands received by the principal and the availability of the shared resource the resource is distributed among the farmers in this section first we explain the bidding process from farmers perspective next we discuss the water allocation and pricing done by the principal agent 3 1 the bidding process at the start of each time interval k the principal agent asks the farmers for their valuation based on their valuations the farmers bid how much they value surface water during that time slot the bid of farmer n is b n tk and it includes how many units of water she needs and the price per unit of surface water that she is willing to pay for simplicity we use the shorthand notation b n k to represent b n kt similarly for other functions as well thus b n k is a pair i e b n k v ˆ n k d n k where v ˆ n k is how much farmer n claims to value a unit of surface water and d n k is the demand for farmer n the demand function d n k is the amount of water required in k th interval if this demand is not satisfied with the surface water farmer n will pump ground water to satisfy demand when moisture level θ n k is less than the minimum moisture level threshold θ n m i n i e θ n k θ n m i n the farmer can pump groundwater anywhere in the interval k whereas surface water is available to the farmers at the start of each interval k the actual valuation v n k of farmer n for surface water depends upon a number of factors that include groundwater pumping cost c g knapp et al 2018 current water demand d n k of the farm mallios and latinopoulos 2001 and farm size a n tang et al 2013 the valuation for farmer n at interval k is given as follows 6 v n k c g d n k a n it is important to note that v n k does not represent the actual bid of the farmer v ˆ n k which may be different 3 2 water allocation and pricing after receiving the bids from all farmers the principal agent decides how to divide water among the farmers and how much each farmer needs to pay for the water they receive here we explain the water allocation followed by a discussion on water pricing 3 2 1 water allocation to decide regarding the distribution of water the principal agent evaluates each farmer s willingness to pay p n k for water by computing 7 p n k v ˆ n k d n k next the principal orders the bids received from the farmers such that the highest bidder receives water with first priority next if there is still water left the principal agent provides water to the second highest bidder and this continues until all the surface water is divided among the farmers since the supply of surface water is variable and depends on a variety of parameters that include rainfall water supply from glacier melt governmental policies etc how many farmers actually receive water in k th interval cannot be known in advance the water distribution decision by the principal agent is represented by d k d 1 k d 2 k d n k based on the defined water distribution mechanism farmer n receives d n k units of water in the k th interval such that s min d n k d n k s min represents the minimum required amount of water flow in the watercourse to ensure water supply to a farmer the utility of farmer n in k th interval is u n k which is thus given as 8 u n d n k v n k d n k v n k d n k v n k d n k d n k where the factor d n k d n k is the unmet demand which farmer will have to meet by pumping groundwater if she does not receive the required amount of surface water from the principal 3 2 2 water pricing to compute the surface water payments of farmers the vcg vickrey clarke groves mechanism is used we represent the payments by c n v ˆ n k v ˆ n k to calculate payments based on vcg mechanism the principal agent computes d k and d n k for each farmer n where d k is the social decision vector by principal i e how much surface water each farmer was allocated in k th interval and d n k is the hypothetical social decision vector i e how much water would have been allocated to each farmer if farmer n did not participate in the bidding process next the payment of each farmer n in k th interval is computed as follows 9 c

where p n i k is willingness to pay for water as defined in 7 this indexing classifies the farmers in the decreasing order of priority to get a portion of water from the available surface water supply let the surface water supply be such that the first m farmers in the decreasing order of priority receive water i e d n l k 0 for 1 l m the water allocation mechanism and the decision d k by the

section we present a case study to compare the performance of the proposed water distribution mechanism with the warabandi distribution mechanism practiced conventionally in the ibis we use the past data to form initial models of soil moisture dynamics next we incorporate the collected data in our pricing and allocation scheme to compared it with the currently used water distribution mechanisms in the study region in particular and the indus basin irrigation system in general first we evaluate performance for nominal parameters in the case study area followed by exhaustive numerical simulations to compare both water distribution mechanisms over the physically realizable range of parameters we find that the proposed distribution mechanism performs better than the round robin warabandi system in terms of surface water use and groundwater pumping 4 1 study area area irrigated by watercourse 91093 l located at moza joyia in central punjab pakistan is chosen as the case study site as shown in fig 3 this watercourse is connected with the gogera branch canal the gogera branch canal is a distributary canal that is 137 km in length it is being fed from lbdc lower bari doab canal lbdc is the 201 km long main canal accompanied by 2264 km of distributary canals which irrigate 700 000 ha of land in central punjab pakistan it draws water from the balloki barrage located on river ravi the ravi river is a 720 km long trans boundary river that passes through eastern pakistan after crossing northwestern india it is one of the major rivers of the indus basin the watercourse at the case study site irrigates 444 43 acres of land and the length of this watercourse is 4548 m this watercourse has 49 nakkas in the watercourse nakka is a cut through which water goes directly into fields major crops in the study area are maize sugarcane cotton rice and sorghum there are 24 farmers in the study area and each farmer owns a portion of the land in this area the proportion of land owned by each farmer and watercourse location is shown in fig 4 each farm number area number farm area farm irrigation time draining time filling time net allotted time initial timing and final timing are provided in warabandi roster warabandi roster along the watercourse of our study area is shown in table 2 note that we collected the data at the case study site during the kharif crops autumn crop growth period july to october in 2018 4 2 calculation of model parameters in this section we discuss the methods equations and data resources used to compare performance of the proposed water distribution mechanism with the warabandi distribution mechanism first we discuss the parameters used to calculate the soil moisture dynamics which include crop coefficients reference evapotranspiration deep percolation constant maximum and minimum soil moisture threshold and precipitation at the end we explain the irrigation depth which is used to measure farm water demand 4 2 1 crop coefficient crop coefficient k c t is used in calculating evapotranpirtion as shown in equation 2 several studies elghandour et al 2019 jayanthi et al 2001 irmak et al 2011 show that remote sensing based techniques can be used to measure crop coefficient crop coefficient k c t and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi t have a linear relationship trout and johnson 2007 d urso 2010 a simple linear relationship between k c t and ndvi t is as follows 14 k c t 1 457 n d v i t 0 01725 we adopt this model from kamble et al 2013 we have used the time series sentinel 2 10 m 10 m resolution data to derive ndvi t near infrared and red bands of the data are used to measure ndvi t the ndvi t is given by 15 n d v i t n i r r n i r r where r is the reflectance in the red and nir is the reflectance in the near infrared region of the spectrum data was collected from july 2018 to october 2018 during this time period at different time steps the crop coefficient in our study area is shown in fig 5 the average crop coefficient at the start of the season is low representing less vegetation and crop coefficient values in september high crop coefficient values show the high cropping intensity in the area near the end of the season crop coefficient values start gradually decreasing which shows harvesting of the crop 4 2 2 reference evapotranpirtion reference evapotranspiration et o t data were collected from the usgs fews net data sharing services usgs 2020b the spatial resolution of the data is 1 km 1 km there are five pixels of reference evapotranspiration et o t data that overlap with our study area the pixel area overlapping with our study area is shown in fig 6 monthly reference evapotranspiration et o t values in each pixel of fig 6 are given in table 1 the crop evapotranspiration in equation 2 is calculated by multiplying the reference evapotranpiration et 0 t with crop coefficient k c t the spatial resolution of crop coefficient k c t is 10 m 10 m in order to match the spatial resolution of k c t and et 0 t we have assumed that reference evapotranspiration et o t value is the same for all 10 m 10 m pixel which are part of a 1 km 1 km pixel of et o t hence the crop evapotranspiration e n t spatial resolution is 10 m 10 m 4 2 3 precipitation precipitation r n t data was collected from the data portal developed by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing chrs 2020a we have used data with daily temporal resolution and its spatial resolution is 4 km 4 km the rainfall data in our study area is presented in fig 7 4 2 4 deep percolation constant we have installed a soil moisture sensor in our study area data coming from this sensor is used to calculate the deep percolation constant c n at this point in the study area the c n value at this point in the study area is 0 15 10 4 deep percolation constant depends upon soil type we have assumed a small random variation in the calculated value measured from the installed sensor to calculate the deep percolation constant values at other farms the deep percolation constant value for each farm is selected from the range 0 5 104 2 104 using a uniform random distribution and this range covers almost all types of soils in the study area 4 2 5 irrigation depth irrigation depth l n is used to calculate water demand of a farm as shown in equation 4 it depends upon the soil type and root depth of the crop soil type in our study area is loamy major crops in our case study area are alfalfa maize cotton sugarcane sorghum potatoes and wheat these type of crops have deep rooting zone we estimate the irrigation depth using a method described by brouwer et al 1989 estimated irrigation depth in our case study area is 100 mm 4 3 simulation in this section we compare the performance of the proposed water distribution mechanism with traditional warabandi distribution mechanism in our study area we assess performance of the proposed mechanism based on the amount of extra groundwater pumped and the amount of surface water wasted our goal is to compare both mechanisms over physically realizable range of parameters before presenting the results of monte carlo simulation first we illustrate the results with nominal parameters then we present the monte carlo simulation in the end we present interesting cases from monte carlo simulations 4 3 1 simulation setup there are a total of twenty four farmers i e n 24 we evaluate performance for a single cropping season of approximately four months july 2018 to october 2018 and seventeen weeks the maximum and minimum moisture level threshold depends upon the soil type the study area is small and the soil type is the same throughout the area we assume constant maximum and minimum moisture level thresholds so that θ n m a x 0 25 and θ n m i n 0 10 respectively for all farms the initial condition θ n 0 for each farm is randomly chosen from the interval 0 10 0 25 using a uniform random distribution the design capacity of the study area watercourse is not available we assume that study area watercourse design capacity is equivalent to the design capacity of the watercourse adjacent to our study area as area irrigated by both watercourses is approximately equal the design capacity of the adjacent watercourse is 1 6 106 cusec week on farm water management 2017 in pakistan the average canal efficiency is 75 frenken et al 2012 thus only 75 of the watercourse design capacity water reaches the watercourse i e 1 2 106 cusec week under the proposed mechanism each farmer computes the water demand and declares a bid at the start of each week the farmers fulfill their water requirements through groundwater pumping if surface water is insufficient to meet their demand the groundwater cost in our study area is c g 0 10 pkr the farmers may also pump groundwater during the week if the soil moisture level θ n t reaches the lower threshold θ n m i n i e θ n t θ n m i n in the warabandi mechanism the water is distributed among farmers using a roster shown in table 2 this warabandi roster is rotational and repeats each week 4 3 2 performance evaluation for nominal parameters we evaluate surface water wasted the difference in pumped water and the difference in cost incurred by farmers to compare the proposed mechanism with the warabandi mechanism for a nominal set of parameters the surface water supply each week is shown in fig 8 each farm soil moisture level over the entire season is shown in fig 9 water demand and the surface water received at the start of the week by each farmer when water is distributed through the proposed mechanism and warabandi mechanism are shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively the surface water received and groundwater pumped in the proposed mechanism are shown in fig 12 in figs 10 and 11 water demand for all farmers in week 3 is almost zero water demand is zero in this week due to rain although water demand is zero in this week farmers are receiving water in the warabandi mechanism in the proposed mechanism water is not being supplied to farmers with zero demand since water is provided to farmers depending upon their demand in warabandi mechanism farmers are receiving water irrespective of their demand farmers 1 4 and 5 are receiving more water compared to other farmers in the proposed mechanism fig 12 shows that farmer 1 4 and 5 are not pumping groundwater throughout the season except in week 6 the soil moisture level of farmer 1 4 and 5 reaches the minimum moisture threshold at the end of the week thus at the start of each week their demand is higher and they bid for water at a higher price consequently getting water at a high priority all other farmers moisture level touches the minimum moisture level threshold during the week thus all other farmers have to fulfill their demand during the week through groundwater pumping farmers cannot wait for the surface water supply at the start of the week as the surface water supply is uncertain in the study area in the proposed mechanism if a farmer s water demand and per unit of water bidding price is small compared to other farmers the farmer may not get water or get water less than the demand for example in week 12 farmer 19 s water demand is less than other farmers so she did not receive water that week the surface water bidding price per acre and charged price per acre in pkr are shown in fig 13 the bidding price is always greater or equal to the charged price farmers are getting charges for surface water in week 1 5 7 and 12 farmers are not getting charged for surface water when water available is greater than the total demand of all farmers because the procedure of farmer s payment calculation considers the social impact of a farmer on other farmers when water available is greater than the total water demand of all farmers there is no social impact of a farmer on others fig 14 shows the weekly difference in total water pumped the difference in total surface water used and difference in total cost incurred by all farmers combined when water is distributed through warabandi distribution mechanism compared to proposed allocation mechanism in the study area a positive difference in total water pumped indicates more pumping in the warabandi case the difference is almost zero during a few weeks groundwater pumped is almost equal during these weeks in both distribution mechanism fig 14 also shows the difference in surface water used per week between the warabandi distribution mechanism and the proposed allocation mechanism a positive difference indicates more water is being used in the warabandi mechanism compared to the proposed mechanism in the warabandi distribution mechanism if the water received is more than demand farmers do not use extra surface water resulting in wastage in the form of run off farmers do not receive excess water in the proposed mechanism since water is supplied according to their demand fig 14 also represents the weekly difference in the total cost incurred by all farmers combined between the warabandi distribution mechanism and proposed allocation mechanism a positive difference indicates farmers are incurring more costs in the warabandi mechanism a negative difference indicates more cost is being incurred in the proposed mechanism in the proposed mechanism surface water price is always less than groundwater price since farmers willingness to pay for surface water is less or equal to groundwater price in the warabandi mechanism surface water price is a fixed one time cost in a season and is negligible compared to groundwater pumping price the cost incurred by farmers in week 1 5 7 and 12 is negative since surface water price in these weeks is non zero surface water price is non zero in week 1 5 7 and 12 for most of the farmers and zero during other weeks as shown in fig 13 in the proposed mechanism the surface water payment for a farmer is non zero when surface water is scarce i e the surface water supply is not enough to fulfill all farmers water demand the proposed pricing mechanism charges farmers according to their social impact on others it does not charge farmers when water is in abundance since water usage by a farmer does not affect water availability for other farmers the positive cost difference in week 2 6 10 13 14 and 16 indicates that the groundwater pumping cost combined with surface water cost in the proposed mechanism is less than the groundwater pumping cost in the warabandi mechanism it also suggests that more water is being pumped in the warabandi mechanism in these weeks zero difference means an equal amount of groundwater is being pumped and surface water cost in the proposed mechanism is zero the comparison results indicate that the proposed mechanism performs much better than the warabandi mechanism in terms of water efficiency since less water is being pumped and there is no surface water wastage in the proposed mechanism in the proposed mechanism the weekly cost incurred by farmers is low compared to warabandi mechanism when farmers are pumping lower amount of water and surface water is enough to meet farmers demand the cost incurred by farmers is higher in the proposed mechanism when surface water available is less than the total water demand of the farmers 4 3 3 monte carlo simulations next to compare both mechanisms over the physically realizable extent of the parameter space we perform repetitive numerical simulations by randomly varying the model parameters over a range that impersonates real world behavior we analyze the difference in total water pumped the difference in total surface water used and total difference in cost incurred to compare both mechanisms while randomly varying the surface water supply deep percolation constant crop coefficient and rain amount over the physically realizable range the maximum available surface water in the study area watercourse is 1 6 106 cusec surface water supply range is 0 1 6 106 cusec the deep percolation constant c k range is 0 5 10 4 2 10 4 and this range covers almost all types of soils in our study area the crop coefficient k c t and reference evapotranspiration et o t are chosen randomly from the data set given by ullah et al 2001 for the study area the daily rain data of the past 21 years was obtained from data portal developed by nasa anon 2021 the daily rain in the simulation is chosen randomly from 21 given samples the initial condition θ k 0 for each farmer is chosen through uniform distribution over an interval 0 10 0 25 we have repeated these simulations 1 104 times fig 15 shows the total difference in water pumped the surface water used and cost incurred by farmers when water is distributed through warabandi mechanism compared to the proposed mechanism the positive difference in water pumped represents that more water is being pumped in the warabandi mechanism compared to the proposed mechanism the average difference in pumped water is positive because farmers get water in the warabandi mechanism regardless of their demand farmers have to pump water if water received by a farmer is less than her demand to fulfill its water requirements therefore on average farmers have to pump more water in the warabandi mechanism than the proposed mechanism the positive difference in surface water wasted shows that more water is being used in the warabandi mechanism than the proposed mechanism in the warabandi mechanism when the water received by a farmer is greater than her demand the extra water gets wasted in the form of run off the negative difference in the total cost represents that farmers are incurring more costs in the proposed mechanism in the proposed mechanism the principal agent charges farmers for surface water when water is scarce while in the warabandi mechanism farmers pay a negligible cost once in a season the general results of monte carlo simulations demonstrate a better performance through our approach but there are some anomalies in the monte carlo simulation the difference in groundwater pumping is negative for a small number of cases this negative difference represents more groundwater pumping in the proposed mechanism the negative difference in cost shows more cost is being incurred in the proposed mechanism these anomalies do not disaffirm the proposed mechanism as we will explore these exceptions in the next section 5 discussion in this paper we have compared the performance of the proposed mechanism with warabandi mechanism we evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism based on the amount of water pumped amount of surface water wastage and cost incurred by farmers in the monte carlo simulation the general conclusion about performance of the proposed mechanism holds for majority of the cases over the realistic parameter values despite these results some exceptions exist but these exceptions happen only in a minority of cases even in these minority of exceptions less surface water is being used in the proposed mechanism groundwater pumping in the proposed mechanism compared to warabandi mechanism is higher in a minority of cases for groundwater pumping we explore the worst case encountered in the monte carlo simulation in the worst case the total groundwater pumped difference is 1 601 106 cusec throughout the season when water is distributed using the warabandi mechanism compared to the proposed mechanism the negative sign represents more groundwater is being pumped in the proposed mechanism in this case farmers are pumping extra water in the proposed mechanism because the water demand is high and the surface water supply is scarce the surface water supply is less than the demand in most of the weeks throughout the season as shown in fig 17 in case of scarcity the proposed mechanism provides water to the farmers who value it the most therefore in case of scarcity other farmers have to pump groundwater to fulfill their demand even in the worst case the overall water usage groundwater and surface water is less in the proposed mechanism the difference in water usage per week for this case is shown in fig 16 farmers use less water groundwater and surface water throughout the season except in weeks 2 6 10 and 13 overall farmers are using less water in the proposed mechanism in the monte carlo simulations the cost incurred by farmers is greater most of the time in the proposed mechanism this does not go against the intention of the proposed mechanism which was fair pricing and allocation of water even then a lot of cases occur with cost saving because the proposed mechanism does not charge for water when the water supply is greater than water demand and less groundwater pumping leads towards cost saving in the proposed mechanism for cost incurred by farmers we explore the worst case encountered in the monte carlo simulation in the worst case the difference in the total cost incurred by farmers is 8 56 105 pkr throughout the season when water is distributed using warabandi mechanism compared to the proposed mechanism the negative sign represents that the higher cost is being incurred in the proposed mechanism this higher cost in the proposed mechanism is because of the higher water demand compared to the surface water supply for this case the water demand and surface water supply throughout the season is given in the fig 18 the cost incurred by farmers is higher when the surface water supply is scarce the proposed mechanism charges farmers when the surface water supply is scarce our results show that the proposed mechanism leads to a more efficient utilization of surface water and a corresponding reduction in wastage similar effects have been observed in real world cases naghdi et al 2021 kadi and ziyad 2018 fu et al 2018 where demand based allocation schemes have led to better utilization of surface irrigation water groundwater depletion is posing threat to global food and water security famiglietti 2014 wada et al 2010 we have demonstrated that the groundwater usage has reduced when surface water is distributed through the proposed mechanism similar results can be seen in studies zeinali et al 2020 tian et al 2015 where efficient distribution of surface water led towards sustainable groundwater usage undervaluation of water has been a significant challenge in ensuring fairness in irrigation systems around the world du et al 2010 lahsen et al 2016 munguía lópez et al 2019 the second price auction that we propose has been shown to guarantee truthful valuation on behalf of the bidders easley et al 2010 both in theory and in practical settings nisan and ronen 2007 varian and harris 2014 furthermore the vcg mechanism that lies at the heart of our approach ensures a fair pricing scheme by taking into account the social impact of a user on other users vcg is widely used in other related settings as well hobbs et al 2000 samadi et al 2012 langbort 2012 tanaka and gupta 2016 where it provides an attractive market model by attaining zero efficiency loss and individual rationality shoham and leyton brown 2008 6 conclusion this paper discusses a demand based surface water distribution mechanism the proposed mechanism s objective is to distribute surface water among farmers in a socially optimal manner while decreasing surface water wastage and groundwater pumping the mechanism promotes truthful reporting of water valuation by farmers through a case study conducted at a watercourse in ibis we have exhibited that the farmers pump less water when water is distributed using the proposed mechanism compared to the traditional warabandi system in ibis assuring a more sustainable future for groundwater resources we also see that under the proposed mechanism there is no surface water wastage as farmers are getting surface water as per their demand compared to the warabandi mechanism in the warabandi mechanism a fixed among of water is supplied to farmers irrespective of their demand in the proposed mechanism farmers weekly water costs are low compared to the warabandi mechanism when the surface water supply is enough to fulfill all farmers demands at the start of the week and farmers pump less groundwater throughout the week in the case of surface water abundance the proposed pricing mechanisms do not charge for water as the net social impact of a farmer using surface water is zero on other farmers in the case of scarcity the proposed mechanism charges a farmer according to her water usage impact on other farmers water supply the weekly water costs incurred by farmers are high when surface water is scarce although the approach has been demonstrated for a specific region in the indus basin the technique is generic and applicable to other regions as well lastly we hope that this study serves as a small step towards solving an

swspt and 152 for swsp30 respectively these numbers used for meta analysis are shown on the right side of the bar in fig 3 data were normally distributed with high heterogeneities as indicated by greater qt values supplementary fig s1 cover crop overall decreased pse by 33 4 compared to no cover crop fig 3a this was true for legume nonlegume and legume and nonlegume cover crop mixture cover crop reduced pse compared to no cover crop in all climatic regions except for the humid region the reduction in pse was greater in the arid and subhumid regions than in the semiarid region cover crop also reduced pse compared to no cover crop in silt loam and clay loam soils but increased in loam soil surface placement and incorporation of cover crop residue into the soil reduced pse compared to residue removal a polynomial relationship was found between rr of pse and cover crop biomass fig 4a the pse was maximized at cover crop biomass of around 5 0mgha 1 no significant relationships were found between the rr of pse fig 4b all cover crop species and mixtures also exhibited lower swspt with an overall decline of 13 2 for cover crop compared to no cover crop fig 3b the swspt was lower with cover cropping than without in arid semiarid and subhumid regions but not in the humid region fig 3b cover crop also reduced swspt in sandy loam loam silt loam and clay loam soils with little effect in silty clay loam soil all residue management practices reduced swspt and no significant differences were found among cover crop residues being incorporated into the soil surface placed and removed out the relationship between rr of swspt and cover crop biomass was not significant fig 4a however the rr of swspt was maximized at an interval of 20 d between cover crop termination and succeeding crop planting in contrast to that for swspt cover crop overall increased swsp30 by 6 0 compared to no cover crop especially for nonlegumes and legumes but not for the mixture fig 3c the swsp30 increased with cover cropping compared to no cover cropping in semiarid and humid regions but minimum impact in arid and subhumid regions however swsp30 due to cover crop vs no cover crop was greater in silt loam loam and silt clay loam residue incorporation into the soil increased but residue removal decreased swsp30 compared to surface placement of the residue the rr of swsp30 increased linearly with increased cover crop biomass fig 4a but not correlated with the interval between cover crop termination and succeeding crop planting 3 2 succeeding crop yield data for succeeding crop yield 418 paired observations shown on the right of bars in fig 5 were heterogeneous and normally distributed across studies supplementary fig s1 cover crop overall did not affect succeeding crop yield fig 5a the effect of cover crop species on succeeding crop yield was also not significant although legume and the mixture of legume and nonlegume cover crops tended to increase succeeding crop yield but nonlegume cover crop tended to decrease it the succeeding crop yield decreased with cover crop relative to no cover crop in the semiarid region but increased it in the subhumid and humid regions compared to no cover crop cover crop decreased succeeding crop yield in sandy loam soil but increased in clay loam soil cover crop residue removal reduced succeeding crop yield but residue placed at the surface or incorporated into the soil had no effect on succeeding crop yield the rr of succeeding crop yield increased linearly with increased cover crop biomass fig 6a similarly the rr of succeeding crop yield increased with increased interval between cover crop termination and succeeding crop planting fig 6b the rr of succeeding crop yield was also linearly related to rr of swspt fig 7 3 3 evapotranspiration and water use efficiency as with succeeding crop yield data for succeeding crop et and wue 188 and 148 paired observations shown on the right of bars in fig 5 were heterogeneous and normally distributed across studies supplementary fig s1 cover crop decreased et of succeeding crop irrespective of the species with an overall decrease of 6 2 compared to no cover crop fig 5b cover crop decreased et compared to no cover crop in arid semiarid and humid regions but had no effect in the subhumid region cover crop also decreased et compared to no cover crop in silt loam and silty clay but not in other soil textures surface placement or incorporation of cover crop residue into the soil decreased et but residue removal increased et the rr of et declined with increased cover crops biomass fig 6a but increased with increased interval between cover crop termination and succeeding crop planting fig 6b the rr of et was linearly related to the rr of swspt fig 7 cover crop significantly increased wue of succeeding crop by 5 0 compared to no cover crop fig 6c the increase was contributed primarily by legume cover crop with limited effect of nonlegume and mixture of legume and nonlegume cover crops cover crop increased succeeding crop wue compared to no cover crop in the semiarid subhumid and humid regions similarly cover crop increased succeeding crop wue in silt loam silt clay loam and clay loam soils but decreased it in sandy loam soil cover crop residue placed at the surface increased but residue removal reduced succeeding crop wue the rr of wue was linearly related to rr of swspt fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 effect of cover crop on soil water storage the reduction in pse due to cover crop compared to no cover crop fig 3a was probably attributable to water uptake by cover crop during its growth this probably resulted in reduced swspt for all cover crop species compared to no cover crop fig 3b extraction of water by cover crop roots to enhance aboveground biomass may have reduced pse and swspt the increased swsp30 for all cover crop species except for the cover crop mixture fig 3c could be the result of soil water recharge at the surface layer following precipitation followed by reduction in evaporation due to residue accumulated at the soil surface the change in soil water storage with cover cropping is a result of the balance between soil water depletion due to cover crop evapotranspiration and water conservation from enhanced shading and residue accumulation after cover crop termination mitchell et al 2015b cover crops use water for their growth but the residues after their termination enhance soil water conservation dabney 1998 unger and vigil 1998 and increase water holding capacity by enhancing soil organic matter poeplau and don 2015 porosity villamil et al 2006 hydraulic conductivity blanco canqui et al 2011 and aggregation sainju et al 2003 villamil et al 2006 compared to no cover crop daryanto et al 2018 reported that cover crop increased topsoil 0 5 cm water content by 5 while not affecting water content to a depth of 60 cm soil water extraction by cover crop compared to no cover crop also probably reduced pse and swspt in arid semiarid and subhumid regions fig 3a and b where precipitation is limited and et exceeds precipitation this was not the case in the humid region where increased precipitation compared to et increased pse resulting in the nonsignificant effect of cover crop on swspt however precipitation during cover crop growth and soil water recharge in the surface layer may have resulted in increased swsp30 in semiarid and humid regions or no change in arid and subhumid regions fig 3c soil water depletion due to cover crop should be carefully examined especially in arid and semiarid regions as it can substantially reduce subsequent crop yield depletion of soil water by cover crop also may have reduced pse and swspt in all soil textures fig 3a and b except for pse in loam soil where the limited number of observations n 4 showed an increased in pse due to cover crop compared to no cover crop soil water recharge following precipitation however may have increased swsp30 due to cover crop compared to no cover crop in all soil textures fig 3c increased water extraction by cover crop compared to water conservation by cover crop residue probably increased pse and swspt with surface placement and incorporated residue into the soil fig 3a and b residue retention either at the soil surface or through incorporation into the soil clearly increased swsp30 by increasing soil water conservation from the mulch effect of residue while residue removal diminished swsp30 fig 3c cover crop biomass can affect pse and swsp30 in various ways increased shading from enhanced cover crop biomass can reduce evaporation and therefore maintain swsp30 blanco canqui et al 2015 mitchell et al 2015a 2015b in contrast greater water extraction from increased cover crop biomass can reduce pse and swsp unger and vigil 1998 the positive linear relationship between rr of cover crop and cover crop biomass for pse fig 4a suggests that increased shading effect from cover crop biomass probably enhanced pse positive relationship between rr of swsp30 and cover crop biomass also occurred to a biomass of 5mgha 1 above which the rr declined with further increase in biomass this suggests that cover crop biomass should not be accumulated to more than 5mgha 1 in order to maintain soil water in surface layers and succeeding crop yield as dryland crop yield depends on surface soil water storage at planting swsp30 unger and vigil 1998 nielsen et al 2015b barker et al 2018 observed no difference in swspt to a depth of 1 2 m in the spring and swsp30 in the winter following cover crops compared to no cover crop when the biomass was 1 75mgha 1 in nebraska timing of cover crop termination can influence swspt by reducing water extraction by cover crop early termination reduces cover crop biomass but increases swspt by increasing soil water recharge during the fallow period following precipitation by increasing the interval between cover crop termination and succeeding crop planting in contrast late termination can enhance cover crop biomass but reduces swspt by extracting soil water by cover crop this result fig 4b demonstrates that 20 d is the appropriate interval between cover crop termination and succeeding crop planting to maximize swspt although swspt increased from 0 to 20 d interval it declined after 20 d probably because of increased water loss from evaporation some researchers clark et al 1997 whish et al 2009 daigh et al 2014 reported that 14 d interval between cover crop termination and succeeding crop planting can be used to enhance swspt increasing the interval to 4 wk can reduce soil water storage clark et al 1997 towing to increased surface evaporation 4 2 effect of cover crop on succeeding crop yield the overall nonsignificant effect of cover crop on succeeding crop yield fig 5a can be explained by soil water and nutrient availability legume cover crops have been known to enhance succeeding crop yields by supplying n compared to non legumes or no cover crop but nonlegume cover crops can reduce yields gabriel and quemada 2011 alvarez et al 2017 marcillo and miguez 2017 daryanto et al 2018 this was also observed for slightly but not significantly greater succeeding crop yield with legume and mixture of legume and nonlegume cover crops compared to no cover crop legumes can fix n from the atmosphere and rapid mineralization of the n rich residues can enrich soil inorganic n to meet n demand of succeeding crops daryanto et al 2018 in contrast the slightly negative succeeding crop yield with nonlegume cover crop compared to no cover crop was probably resulting from greater water extraction by cover crop due to increase biomass followed by soil n immobilization by nonlegume cover crop residue due to its greater c n ratio nonlegume cover crops produce greater above and belowground biomass and have higher c n ratio than legume cover crops kuo et al 1997 the overall result was the nonsignificant effect of cover crop on succeeding crop yield as data were pooled from legume nonlegume and legume and nonlegume mixture and no cover crop for analysis the nonsignificant or negative effect of rr of cover crop on succeeding crop yield in arid and semiarid regions fig 5a can be attributed to reduced soil water storage due to water extraction by cover crops and limited precipitation in these regions as precipitation following cover crop termination may not be enough to recharge soil water and sustain succeeding crop yield unger and vigil 1998 studies in arid and semiarid regions have reported that cover crops reduced succeeding crop yields by depleting soil water compared to no cover crop lyon et al 2007 kramberger et al 2009 nielsen et al 2015b it may be possible that cover crop residue accumulated at the soil surface conserved soil water resulting in the nonsignificant effect of cover crop on swsp30 in the arid region or increased value in the semiarid region fig 3b although swspt was lower with cover crop than without fig 3c because most of the root growth occurs in the surface soil layer soil water stored in the surface layer may be more important for crop growth than water stored in the entire soil profile as a result there was no significant effect of cover crop on succeeding crop yield in the arid and semiarid regions in subhumid and humid regions where precipitation is abundant extraction of soil water by cover crop probably has limited effect on soil water recharge resulting in increased succeeding crop yield in these regions ewing et al 1991 unger and vigil 1998 increased swspt due to cover crop compared to no cover crop increased succeeding crop yield fig 7 differences in water holding capacity of soils probably affected the rr of cover crop on succeeding crop yield among soil textures fig 5a unger and vigil 1998 blanco canqui and ruis 2020 cover crop may have extracted most of the water from coarse textured soil due to its lower water holding capacity resulting in reduced succeeding crop yield with cover crop compared to no cover crop in sandy loam soil unger and vigil 1998 furthermore coarse textured soils may also have more water lost through evaporation and deep percolation more rapidly than fine textured soils affecting succeeding crop yield the reverse may be true in fine textured clay loam soil where its greater water holding capacity may have limited water extraction by cover crop resulting in increased soil water availability for succeeding crop and enhancing its yield retaining cover crop residue either through surface placement or incorporation into the soil probably enhanced soil water conservation and nutrient supply thereby resulting slightly but nonsignificantly in increased succeeding crop yield with the residue placed at the soil surface or incorporated into the soil fig 5a in contrast reduced soil water conservation and nutrient input resulting from residue removal may have reduced succeeding crop yield with this treatment retention of cover crop residue in the soil is critical for conserving soil water and increasing succeeding crop yield unger and vigil 1998 chalise et al 2019 cover crop residue incorporated into the soil regardless of species can increase nutrient supply and support succeeding crop yield compared to residue removal poeplau and don 2015 4 3 cover crop effect on succeeding crop water use the lower et of the succeeding crop for all cover crop species compared to no cover crop fig 5b was probably due to reduced swspt fig 3b it may be possible that increased water extraction by cover crop reduced swspt and therefore et the negative et response for cover crop compared to no cover crop was observed in all climatic zones except nonsignificant in the subhumid region fig 5b this result also parallels with lower swspt in all climatic regions where swspt for cover crop compared to no cover crop was lower or not significant in all regions fig 3b similarly reduced et for cover crop compared to no cover crop also occurred in silt loam and silty clay loam soils where swspt were lower or not significantly different fig 3b enhanced soil water conservation due to cover crop residue retention in the soil whether at the surface or incorporated may have reduced swspt fig 3b and therefore et fig 5b residue removal from the soil however increased et with cover crop compared to no cover crop although it reduced swspt fig 3b increased water lost through evaporation due to residue removal may have increased et residue cover in the soil often reduces soil temperature consequently reducing evaporation dabney 1998 gabriel et al 2014 there was a strong positive relationship between et and swspt fig 7 suggesting that et reduces as swspt decreases a negative linear relationship also occurred between rr of cover crop and cover crop biomass for et fig 6a it is likely that increased cover crop biomass occurred at the expense of swspt thereby reducing et in contrast a positive linear relationship occurred between rr of cover crop and the interval between termination of cover crop and planting of succeeding crop for et fig 6b increased water loss through evaporation during the fallow period probably increased et as the interval between cover crop termination and succeeding crop planting increased lack of a significant effect of cover crop on succeeding crop yield but reduced et resulted in the nonsignificant effect of overall cover crop as well as nonlegume and mixed cover crops in wue fig 5 an exception however occurred for legume cover crop where wue was greater fig 5c a small increase in succeeding crop yield but reduced et may have increased wue for legume cover crop similarly increased succeeding crop yield but reduced et may have increased wue for cover crop compared to no cover crop in subhumid and humid regions the nonsignificant effect of cover crop on succeeding crop wue in arid and semiarid regions was due to the limited effect on crop yield and et reduction in succeeding crop yield but nonsignificant effect of cover crop compared to no cover crop on et also reduced wue in sandy loam soil similarly nonsignificant succeeding crop yield but reduced et decreased wue due to cover crop compared to no crop for residue placed at the surface or incorporated into the soil in contrast reduced succeeding crop yield but increased et reduced wue for residue removal the positive relationship between rr of wue and rr of swspt fig 7 suggests that soil water storage at planting may play an important role in wue 4 4 limitations although no publication bias was found in this meta analysis supplementary table s3 limited data available for pse swsp succeeding crop yield et and wue in certain climatic zones and soil texture as well as residue management practices may have resulted in inconclusive results for example rr of cover crop for pse was greater in loam but lower in all other soil textures fig 3 residue removal increased pse but reduced swspt and swsp30 similarly succeeding crop yield and et in response to cover crop compared to no cover crop were lower but wue was greater for silty clay loam soil fig 5 this resulted in the reduced reliability of interpretation for certain parameters in some soil and climatic conditions and residue management practices increased data availability however will enhance the meta analysis of these data in the future 5 conclusions cover crop reduced pse swspt and et compared to no cover crop but had limited effect on succeeding crop yield and wue the effect of cover crop on pse swspt swsp30 succeeding crop yield et and wue varied in regions with various soil and climatic conditions and residue management practices cover crop usually had positive effects on pse swsp30 succeeding crop yield and wue in the humid region and fine textured soil and residue retention in the soil maintaining cover crop biomass to 5mgha 1 and the interval between cover crop termination and succeeding crop planting to 20 d also had positive effect on swspt and succeeding crop yield one approach to enhance swsp succeeding crop yield and wue is to choose cover crops that require less water to grow such as broadleaf types usda ars 2018 especially in arid and semiarid regions there should be at least a 3 week interval between cover crop termination and planting of succeeding crop so that soil water can be recharged during the fallow period leaving cover crop residue on the soil surface can increase soil water storage thanks to reduced et resulting in enhanced crop yield and wue removal of cover crop residue from the soil is undesirable because it reduces swsp30 and swspt promotes et and decreases succeeding crop yield and

irmak 2017 barker et al 2018 cover crop management practices such as the interval between termination of cover crop and planting of succeeding crop residue removal vs residue retention and years of

cover crop on pse swsp and main crop yield are highly site specific and variable in regions with different soil and climatic conditions a comprehensive study of cover crop impacts on soil water storage and succeeding crop yield and water use across various climatic and soil conditions will provide knowledge on cover crop species and their management for maintaining soil water storage sustaining succeeding crop yield and enhancing efficient water use we conducted a global meta analysis of data reported in the literature on the impact of cover crop on pse swsp succeeding crop yields et and wue under various soil and climatic conditions we hypothesized that cover crop would decrease pse and swsp especially in arid and semiarid areas which would have limited effect on succeeding

considered that water losses due surface runoff and deep drainage are negligible the et was calculated as 5 et swsp swsh p g i where pg and i represented precipitation and irrigation during growth of

precipitation during the fallow period geographical information of the experimental site and soil texture if data on air temperature precipitation and soil texture were lacking we obtained these through online search https www whatsmygps com the data were grouped to maximize in group homogenization we used the aridity index unep 1997 to classify the climatic zone the aridity index ai for each study was calculated as 6 a i m a p m a e where map is the mean annual precipitation and mae the mean annual evapotranspiration at the experimental site the climatic zone for each study was classified into hyper arid arid semiarid subhumid and humid according to aridity index value of 0 03 0 03 0 2 0 2 0 5 0 5 0 65 and 0 65 respectively all experimental sites were mapped using arcgis based on the

the response ratio rr as the effect size was used to test cover crop effect on measured parameters hedges et al 1999 muhammad et al 2019 and was calculated as 7 rr ln cover crop treatment no cover crop treatment ln x cc x ncc ln x cc ln x ncc where xcc and xncc represent mean values of pse swsp succeeding crop yield et and wue in cover crop and no cover crop treatments respectively use of the natural log ratio ensures that equal proportionate changes occurred in the numerator and the denominator the error variance v was calculated as 8 v s cc 2 n cc x cc 2 s ncc 2 n ncc x ncc 2 where scc and sncc are standard deviations and ncc and nncc are numbers of replications for cover crop and no cover crop treatments respectively the weight w for each rr was calculated as 9 w 1 v the unequal variances in the studies were eliminated by giving less weight to the studies with greater variance than those with smaller variance hedges et al 1999 the overall mean rr rre was calculated as 10 rr e

collation indicated no publication bias supplementary table s3 3 results 3 1 precipitation storage efficiency and soil water storage at planting we collected 129 paired observations for pse 465 for swspt and 152 for swsp30 respectively these numbers used for meta analysis are shown on the right side of the bar in fig 3 data were normally distributed with high heterogeneities as indicated by greater qt values supplementary fig s1 cover crop overall decreased pse by 33 4 compared to no cover crop fig 3a this was true for legume nonlegume and legume and nonlegume cover crop mixture cover crop reduced pse compared to no cover crop in all climatic regions except for the humid region the reduction in pse was greater in the arid and subhumid regions than in the semiarid region cover crop also reduced pse compared to no cover crop in silt loam and clay loam soils but increased in loam soil surface placement and incorporation of cover crop residue into the soil reduced pse compared to residue removal a polynomial relationship was found between rr of pse and cover crop biomass fig 4a the pse was maximized at cover crop biomass of around 5 0mgha 1 no significant relationships were found between the rr of pse fig 4b all cover crop species and mixtures also exhibited lower swspt with an overall decline of 13 2 for cover crop compared to no cover crop fig 3b the swspt was lower with cover cropping than without in arid semiarid and subhumid regions but not in the humid region fig 3b cover crop also reduced swspt in sandy loam loam silt loam and clay loam soils with little effect in silty clay loam soil all residue management practices reduced swspt and no significant differences were found among cover crop residues being incorporated into the soil surface placed and removed out the relationship between rr of swspt and cover crop biomass was not significant fig 4a however the rr of swspt was maximized at an interval of 20 d between cover crop termination and succeeding crop planting in contrast to that for swspt cover crop overall increased swsp30 by 6 0 compared to no cover crop especially for nonlegumes and legumes but not for the mixture fig 3c the swsp30 increased with cover cropping compared to no cover cropping in semiarid and humid regions but minimum impact in arid and subhumid regions however swsp30 due to cover crop vs no cover crop was greater in silt loam loam and silt clay loam residue incorporation into the soil increased but residue removal decreased swsp30 compared to surface placement of the residue the rr of swsp30 increased linearly with increased cover crop biomass fig 4a but not correlated with the interval between cover crop termination and succeeding crop planting 3 2 succeeding crop yield data for succeeding crop yield 418 paired observations shown on the right of bars in fig 5 were heterogeneous and normally distributed across studies supplementary fig s1 cover crop overall did not affect succeeding crop yield fig 5a the effect of cover crop species on succeeding crop yield was also not significant although legume and the mixture of legume and nonlegume cover crops tended to increase succeeding crop yield but nonlegume cover crop tended to decrease it the succeeding crop yield decreased with cover crop relative to no cover crop in the semiarid region but increased it in the subhumid and humid regions compared to no cover crop cover crop decreased succeeding crop yield in sandy loam soil but increased in clay loam soil cover crop residue removal reduced succeeding crop yield but residue placed at the surface or incorporated into the soil had no effect on succeeding crop yield the rr of succeeding crop yield increased linearly with increased cover crop biomass fig 6a similarly the rr of succeeding crop yield increased with increased interval between cover crop termination and succeeding crop planting fig 6b the rr of succeeding crop yield was also linearly related to rr of swspt fig 7 3 3 evapotranspiration and water use efficiency as with succeeding crop yield data for succeeding crop et and wue 188 and 148 paired observations shown on the right of bars in fig 5 were heterogeneous and normally distributed across studies supplementary fig s1 cover crop decreased et of succeeding crop irrespective of the species with an overall decrease of 6 2 compared to no cover crop fig 5b cover crop decreased et compared to no cover crop in arid semiarid and humid regions but had no effect in the subhumid region cover crop also decreased et compared to no cover crop in silt loam and silty clay but not in other soil textures surface placement or incorporation of cover crop residue into the soil decreased et but residue removal increased et the rr of et declined with increased cover crops biomass fig 6a but increased with increased interval between cover crop termination and succeeding crop planting fig 6b the rr of et was linearly related to the rr of swspt fig 7 cover crop significantly increased wue of succeeding crop by 5 0 compared to no cover crop fig 6c the increase was contributed primarily by legume cover crop with limited effect of nonlegume and mixture of legume and nonlegume cover crops cover crop increased succeeding crop wue compared to no cover crop in the semiarid subhumid and humid regions similarly cover crop increased succeeding crop wue in silt loam silt clay loam and clay loam soils but decreased it in sandy loam soil cover crop residue placed at the surface increased but residue removal reduced succeeding crop wue the rr of wue was linearly related to rr of swspt fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 effect of cover crop on soil water storage the reduction in pse due to cover crop compared to no cover crop fig 3a was probably attributable to water uptake by cover crop during its growth this probably resulted in reduced swspt for all cover crop species compared to no cover crop fig 3b extraction of water by cover crop roots to enhance aboveground biomass may have reduced pse and swspt the increased swsp30 for all cover crop species except for the cover crop mixture fig 3c could be the result of soil water recharge at the surface layer following precipitation followed by reduction in evaporation due to residue accumulated at the soil surface the change in soil water storage with cover cropping is a result of the balance between soil water depletion due to cover crop evapotranspiration and water conservation from enhanced shading and residue accumulation after cover crop termination mitchell et al 2015b cover crops use water for their growth but the residues after their termination enhance soil water conservation dabney 1998 unger and vigil 1998 and increase water holding capacity by enhancing soil organic matter poeplau and don 2015 porosity villamil et al 2006 hydraulic conductivity blanco canqui et al 2011 and aggregation sainju et al 2003 villamil et al 2006 compared to no cover crop daryanto et al 2018 reported that cover crop increased topsoil 0 5 cm water content by 5 while not affecting water content to a depth of 60 cm soil water extraction by cover crop compared to no cover crop also probably reduced pse and swspt in arid semiarid and subhumid regions fig 3a and b where precipitation is limited and et exceeds precipitation this was not the case in the humid region where increased precipitation compared to et increased pse resulting in the nonsignificant effect of cover crop on swspt however precipitation during cover crop growth and soil water recharge in the surface layer may have resulted in increased swsp30 in semiarid and humid regions or no change in arid and subhumid regions fig 3c soil water depletion due to cover crop should be carefully examined especially in arid and semiarid regions as it can substantially reduce subsequent crop yield depletion of soil water by cover crop also may have reduced pse and swspt in all soil textures fig 3a and b except for pse in loam soil where the limited number of observations n 4 showed an increased in pse due to cover crop compared to no cover crop soil water recharge following precipitation however may have increased swsp30 due to cover crop compared to no cover crop in all soil textures fig 3c increased water extraction by cover crop compared to water conservation by cover crop residue probably increased pse and swspt with surface placement and incorporated residue into the soil fig 3a and b residue retention either at the soil surface or through incorporation into the soil clearly increased swsp30 by increasing soil water conservation from the mulch effect of residue while residue removal diminished swsp30 fig 3c cover crop biomass can affect pse and swsp30 in various ways increased shading from enhanced cover crop biomass can reduce evaporation and therefore maintain swsp30 blanco canqui et al 2015 mitchell et al 2015a 2015b in contrast greater water extraction from increased cover crop biomass can reduce pse and swsp unger and vigil 1998 the positive linear relationship between rr of cover crop and cover crop biomass for pse fig 4a suggests that increased shading effect from cover crop biomass probably enhanced pse positive relationship between rr of swsp30 and cover crop biomass also occurred to a biomass of 5mgha 1 above which the rr declined with further increase in biomass this suggests that cover crop biomass should not be accumulated to more than 5mgha 1 in order to maintain soil water in surface layers and succeeding crop yield as dryland crop yield depends on surface soil water storage at planting swsp30 unger and vigil 1998 nielsen et al 2015b barker et al 2018 observed no difference in swspt to a depth of 1 2 m in the spring and swsp30 in the winter following cover crops compared to no cover crop when the biomass was 1 75mgha 1 in nebraska timing of cover crop termination can influence swspt by reducing water extraction by cover crop early termination reduces cover crop biomass but increases swspt by increasing soil water recharge during the fallow period following precipitation by increasing the interval between cover crop termination and succeeding crop planting in contrast late termination can enhance cover crop biomass but reduces swspt by extracting soil water by cover crop this result fig 4b demonstrates that 20 d is the appropriate interval between cover crop termination and succeeding crop planting to maximize swspt although swspt increased from 0 to 20 d interval it declined after 20 d probably because of increased water loss from evaporation some researchers clark et al 1997 whish et al 2009 daigh et al 2014 reported that 14 d interval between cover crop termination and succeeding crop planting can be used to enhance swspt increasing the interval to 4 wk can reduce soil water storage clark et al 1997 towing to increased surface evaporation 4 2 effect of cover crop on succeeding crop yield the overall nonsignificant effect of cover crop on succeeding crop yield fig 5a can be explained by soil water and nutrient availability legume cover crops have been known to enhance succeeding crop yields by supplying n compared to non legumes or no cover crop but nonlegume cover crops can reduce yields gabriel and quemada 2011 alvarez et al 2017 marcillo and miguez 2017 daryanto et al 2018 this was also observed for slightly but not significantly greater succeeding crop yield with legume and mixture of legume and nonlegume cover crops compared to no cover crop legumes can fix n from the atmosphere and rapid mineralization of the n rich residues can enrich soil inorganic n to meet n demand of succeeding crops daryanto et al 2018 in contrast the slightly negative succeeding crop yield with nonlegume cover crop compared to no cover crop was probably resulting from greater water extraction by cover crop due to increase biomass followed by soil n immobilization by nonlegume cover crop residue due to its greater c n ratio nonlegume cover crops produce greater above and belowground biomass and have higher c n ratio than legume cover crops kuo et al 1997 the overall result was the nonsignificant effect of cover crop on succeeding crop yield as data were pooled from legume nonlegume and legume and nonlegume mixture and no cover crop for analysis the nonsignificant or negative effect of rr of cover crop on succeeding crop yield in arid and semiarid regions fig 5a can be attributed to reduced soil water storage due to water extraction by cover crops and limited precipitation in these regions as precipitation following cover crop termination may not be enough to recharge soil water and sustain succeeding crop yield unger and vigil 1998 studies in arid and semiarid regions have reported that cover crops reduced succeeding crop yields by depleting soil water compared to no cover crop lyon et al 2007 kramberger et al 2009 nielsen et al 2015b it may be possible that cover crop residue accumulated at the soil surface conserved soil water resulting in the nonsignificant effect of cover crop on swsp30 in the arid region or increased value in the semiarid region fig 3b although swspt was lower with cover crop than without fig 3c because most of the root growth occurs in the surface soil layer soil water stored in the surface layer may be more important for crop growth than water stored in the entire soil profile as a result there was no significant effect of cover crop on succeeding crop yield in the arid and semiarid regions in subhumid and humid regions where precipitation is abundant extraction of soil water by cover crop probably has limited effect on soil water recharge resulting in increased succeeding crop yield in these regions ewing et al 1991 unger and vigil 1998 increased swspt due to cover crop compared to no cover crop increased succeeding crop yield fig 7 differences in water holding capacity of soils probably affected the rr of cover crop on succeeding crop yield among soil textures fig 5a unger and vigil 1998 blanco canqui and ruis 2020 cover crop may have extracted most of the water from coarse textured soil due to its lower water holding capacity resulting in reduced succeeding crop yield with cover crop compared to no cover crop in sandy loam soil unger and vigil 1998 furthermore coarse textured soils may also have more water lost through evaporation and deep percolation more rapidly than fine textured soils affecting succeeding crop yield the reverse may be true in fine textured clay loam soil where its greater water holding capacity may have limited water extraction by cover crop resulting in increased soil water availability for succeeding crop and enhancing its yield retaining cover crop residue either through surface placement or incorporation into the soil probably enhanced soil water conservation and nutrient supply thereby resulting slightly but nonsignificantly in increased succeeding crop yield with the residue placed at the soil surface or incorporated into the soil fig 5a in contrast reduced soil water conservation and nutrient input resulting from residue removal may have reduced succeeding crop yield with this treatment retention of cover crop residue in the soil is critical for conserving soil water and increasing succeeding crop yield unger and vigil 1998 chalise et al 2019 cover crop residue incorporated into the soil regardless of species can increase nutrient supply and support succeeding crop yield compared to residue removal poeplau and don 2015 4 3 cover crop effect on succeeding crop water use the lower et of the succeeding crop for all cover crop species compared to no cover crop fig 5b was probably due to reduced swspt fig 3b it may be possible that increased water extraction by cover crop reduced swspt and therefore et the negative et response for cover crop compared to no cover crop was observed in all climatic zones except nonsignificant in the subhumid region fig 5b this result also parallels with lower swspt in all climatic regions where swspt for cover crop compared to no cover crop was lower or not significant in all regions fig 3b similarly reduced et for cover crop compared to no cover crop also occurred in silt loam and silty clay loam soils where swspt were lower or not significantly different fig 3b enhanced soil water conservation due to cover crop residue retention in the soil whether at the surface or incorporated may have reduced swspt fig 3b and therefore et fig 5b residue removal from the soil however increased et with cover crop compared to no cover crop although it reduced swspt fig 3b increased water lost through evaporation due to residue removal may have increased et residue cover in the soil often reduces soil temperature consequently reducing evaporation dabney 1998 gabriel et al 2014 there was a strong positive relationship between et and swspt fig 7 suggesting that et reduces as swspt decreases a negative linear relationship also occurred between rr of cover crop and cover crop biomass for et fig 6a it is likely that increased cover crop biomass occurred at the expense of swspt thereby reducing et in contrast a positive linear relationship occurred between rr of cover crop and the interval between termination of cover crop and planting of succeeding crop for et fig 6b increased water loss through evaporation during the fallow period probably increased et as the interval between cover crop termination and succeeding crop planting increased lack of a significant effect of cover crop on succeeding crop yield but reduced et resulted in the nonsignificant effect of overall cover crop as well as nonlegume and mixed cover crops in wue fig 5 an exception however occurred for legume cover crop where wue was greater fig 5c a small increase in succeeding crop yield but reduced et may have increased wue for legume cover crop similarly increased succeeding crop yield but reduced et may have increased wue for cover crop compared to no cover crop in subhumid and humid regions the nonsignificant effect of cover crop on succeeding crop wue in arid and semiarid regions was due to the limited effect on crop yield and et reduction in succeeding crop yield but nonsignificant effect of cover crop compared to no cover crop on et also reduced wue in sandy loam soil similarly nonsignificant succeeding crop yield but reduced et decreased wue due to cover crop compared to no crop for residue placed at the surface or incorporated into the soil in contrast reduced succeeding crop yield but increased et reduced wue for residue removal the positive relationship between rr of wue and rr of swspt fig 7 suggests that soil water storage at planting may play an important role in wue 4 4 limitations although no publication bias was found in this meta analysis supplementary table s3 limited data available for pse swsp succeeding crop yield et and wue in certain climatic zones and soil texture as well as residue management practices may have resulted in inconclusive results for example rr of cover crop for pse was greater in loam but lower in all other soil textures fig 3 residue removal increased pse but reduced swspt and swsp30 similarly succeeding crop yield and et in response to cover crop compared to no cover crop were lower but wue was greater for silty clay loam soil fig 5 this resulted in the reduced reliability of interpretation for certain parameters in some soil and climatic conditions and residue management practices increased data availability however will enhance the meta analysis of these data in the future 5 conclusions cover crop reduced pse swspt and et compared to no cover crop but had limited effect on succeeding crop yield and wue the effect of cover crop on pse swspt swsp30 succeeding crop yield et and wue varied in regions with various soil and climatic conditions and residue management practices cover crop usually had positive effects on pse swsp30 succeeding crop yield and wue in the humid region and fine textured soil and residue retention in the soil maintaining cover crop biomass to 5mgha 1 and the interval between cover crop termination and succeeding crop planting to 20 d also had positive effect on swspt and succeeding crop yield one approach to enhance swsp succeeding crop yield and wue is to choose cover crops that require less water to grow such as broadleaf types usda ars 2018 especially in arid and semiarid regions there should be at least a 3 week interval between cover crop termination and planting of succeeding crop so that soil water can be recharged during the fallow period leaving cover crop residue on the soil surface can increase soil water storage thanks to reduced et resulting in enhanced crop yield and wue removal of cover crop residue from the soil is undesirable because it reduces swsp30 and swspt promotes et and decreases succeeding crop yield and

9927,drainage network efficiency plays a key role in terms of irrigation and control of floods generation in cultivated areas a crucial aspect to consider in water resource and flood management risk is the assessment of the network storage capacity the latter can be reduced by the uncontrolled growth of vegetation that can modify the ditch cross section altering the hydrological response and

the high resolution topographic technologies in the last few years the exploration of structure from motion sfm photogrammetry technique in parallel with uncrewed aerial vehicles uavs have increased the possibilities for the realisation of rapid low cost and very detailed digital elevation models dem the accurate and high resolution dem generated by uav sfm survey is fundamental to derive geomorphometric features of the agrarian landscape this research aims to present a flexible and low cost workflow to generate an accurate and high resolution uav sfm dem in a large agrarian area of taiwan that can be used to automatically detect the drainage network and to map the vegetation into the ditches through the roughness index the high roughness index values due to the presence of vegetation in the ditches were identified and compared with corresponding measurements in the field to validate and assess the methodology the results confirm the effectiveness of the approach used and underline how the developed workflow could provide on a farm scale and with an unusually high level of detail useful rapid and low cost information to map vegetation obstruction in channel network

networks are very common elements in lowland agricultural landscapes all over the world they play a key role in reducing waterlogging and water erosion purifying water improving groundwater recharge and support water supply in cultivated areas dollinger et al 2015 pijl et al 2018 roelens et al 2016 drainage networks within floodplains constitute man made surface s discontinuities that influence surface runoff overland flow paths and water transfer cazorzi et al 2013 levavasseur et al 2012 therefore these agricultural structures have an important function in terms of control of floods generation moussa et al 2002 sofia et al 2014 along with ditch networks that are more and more incorporated in water solute runoff models roelens et al 2018 a crucial aspect to consider in models for flood management risk is the assessment of the network storage capacity low values of channel storage capacity can underline deficits in the network and they can outline areas whose hydrological behaviour is potentially critical during floods malano and van hofwegen 1999 several studies have shown the high sensitivity of the hydrologic response of a catchment to the geometry of ditches sections roelens et al 2016 in this context vegetation plays a primary role its presence may be due to inadequate maintenance of the drainage network or considerable ponding phenomena caused by the incorrect design of channel slopes vegetation is fundamental for wet and aquatic habitats in lowland landscapes herzon and helenius 2008 van geert et al 2010 dollinger et al 2015 restoring river

nevertheless vegetation modifies the ditch cross section altering the hydrological response and network functionality nepf 2012 aberle and järvelä 2013 indeed according to errico et al 2019 the presence of an undisturbed vegetation community significantly rises the water levels thus possibly increasing the flood risk moreover errico et al 2018 stated that vegetation influences the flow velocity and turbulence as well as the roughness of the bed and banks specifically they vary in function of the vegetated element flexibility their submergence in water and the density aberle and järvelä 2013 ghisalberti et al 2002 rhee et al 2008 takemura and tanaka 2007 a large body of literature attempts to characterise vegetation functional traits affecting hydraulic rugosity through the introduction of the blockage factor of flow by vegetation vinatier et al 2017 vastila et al 2011 confirmed and showed that leaves contributed to almost 90 of the total flow drag highlighting the changes in terms of the vegetation induced roughness in the drainage network it is essential to balance the ecosystem services with the hydraulic safety of the channels through sustainable management needelman et al 2007 for this reason it is important to know which are the potentially critical areas where vegetation could obstruct the section and modify drainage networks storage capacity this last aspect could be quickly identified by analysing roughness patterns in the drainage network as this parameter is strongly linked to the presence or absence of vegetation in the channels errico et al 2018 in recent decades spatial mapping spatial variation in surface roughness has been applied increasingly in planetary science to determine signatures of surface processes smith 2014 advances in remote sensing contributed to the development of more accurate and fast methodologies to compute the surface roughness using high resolution topographic hrt data for example airborne laser scanning als which uses light detection and ranging lidar technology was used to estimate at large scale the surface roughness through digital elevation models dem mckean and roering 2004 smith et al 2004 glenn et al 2006 frankel and dolan 2007 cavalli et al 2008 whilst smith et al 2011 carried out terrestrial laser scanning tls surveys to examine at a detailed scale the ability of a variety of roughness measures to predict the resistance to overland flows in the last few years the exploration of structure from motion sfm photogrammetry technique paired with multiview stereo mvs algorithms

that is the basic data to quickly identify the surface roughness patterns in agricultural ditches this research aims to present a fast low cost and flexible method for vegetation detection in channels that could potentially represent critical hot spots in the drainage network at the agricultural landscape scale taking advantage of uav sfm technology a methodological workflow was developed to realise a high resolution dem useful to identify ditches and channels through morphological approaches carturan et al 2009 cazorzi et al 2013 and to calculate the surface roughness as the standard deviation of residual topography cavalli et al 2008 the high roughness values due to the presence of vegetation in the ditches were identified and compared with corresponding measurements in the field that allowed the validation and the assessment of the methodology the developed workflow could provide on a large scale and with an unusually high level of detail useful information at stakeholders for the management of drainage network and flood risk even underlining the hot spot points with low storage capacity of ditches due to uncontrolled growth of vegetation 2 study areas the study area is located in the village of ruisui 23 29 05 n 121 23 49 e in hualien county central eastern taiwan fig 1a and b the climate in this region is humid and sub tropical the 70 of the year s runoff is concentrated in the rainy season from may to october starting from october the precipitation decreases resulting in a dry season until april yeh et al 2016 the study area is located on the hongye river one of the tributaries of the xiuguluan river fundamental for the agricultural activity of the region agriculture is one of the main economic sectors in the country and cultivated land is over 15 of the surface chen et al 2019 the research area covers about 51 ha ha of which 4 ha is forest 3 ha is urban area and 44 ha is cultivated land mainly used for horticulture fruit trees and tea plantations the surveyed area is in a flat landscape and the rainwater excess is collected in a network of ditches about 21 5 km long the agricultural drainage network generally consists of main sub main and lateral channels these structures are located at the edges of the fields within the parcels and along the main roads the system drains water into the hongye river through culverts located under the main road the average width of the ditches is about 1 m while the depth varies from 0 50 m to 1 m with a rectangular section in the study area three orders of channels have been identified the main drains like those that develop along the roads are in concrete the second and third order drains are open channel dug into the soil although there is a general tendency to remove vegetation from the ditches the poor maintenance resulted in obstruction by vegetation of some sections of the drainage network fig 1c and d small bushes can be seen at the bottom up to larger shrubs even over 1

generation a computer 2xintel xeon bronze 3106 cpu 1 70ghz and 256 gb ram 2xnvidia geforce rtx 2080 ti was used to process all the images the software was agisoft metashape pro v 1 6 2 that extracts the 3d point cloud from the images and creates the 3d model of the agricultural landscape and an orthomosaic after the application of sfm algorithms for the realisation of the sparse point cloud the georeferencing process was carried out using the traditional solution of the gcp coordinates and the output was improved through the bundle adjustment step carrivick et al 2016 the georeferenced dense point clouds were imported into the cloudcompare software omnia version 2 10 2 http www danielgm net to be filtered first the outliers were removed eliminating noise but preserving the features of the surface through the statistical outliers removal sor filter afterwards the point cloud was filtered manually removing unwanted objects e g buildings isolated trees and crops the point clouds were decimated in order to reduce the processing constraints and the extremely high density of the 3d cloud through the geostatistical topography point cloud analysis toolkit topcat successfully used in several studies e g javernick et al 2014 vericat et al 2014 this tool decomposes the point cloud into a set of non overlapping grid cells calculating the statistics for the observations in each grid the minimum elevation within each grid cell was taken to be the ground elevation and a grid cell of 0 10 m was selected to regularise the data set as in brasington et al 2012 the decimated point clouds were used to calculate a triangular irregular network tin that was then converted to a raster through a natural neighbour interpolator resulting in one single dem for the whole study area the output error assessment was a fundamental part of sfm post processing to highlight possible bias and different aspects were considered to analyse the accuracy and precision of the outputs first the sfm point cloud uncertainty was evaluated on gcps and cps considering the residuals of each point i e the difference between the real coordinates of this point measured with the gnss in the field and the modelled sfm values the mean of the residuals provides an indication of the accuracy of the registration process and the point cloud when the gcp and cp residuals are respectively considered instead the standard deviation of the residuals is an indication of the precision cucchiaro et al 2018 to assess uncertainties usually caused by the gridding process especially in the vertical component a statistical comparison test was calculated between randomly selected z values of cps and compared to equivalent z value measurements from dem following the approach of höhle and höhle 2009 the outliers were removed by applying a threshold selected from an initial calculation of the error measures then the root mean square errors rmse standard deviation sde mean error me and the normalized median absolute deviation nmad a robust estimator for the sde more resilient to outliers in the dataset gonçalves et al 2018 cucchiaro et al 2020 were calculated 3 3 morphometric indexes calculation 3 3 1 rea drainage network extraction dem based automatic extraction of the drainage network in agricultural landscapes is an outstanding alternative to the obsolete manual analysis of topographic maps garbrecht and martz 1994 for this purpose the geomorphological indicator relative elevation attribute rea was applied on the high resolution dem rea can be performed according to the following eq 1 as proposed by carturan et al 2009 1 rea r e r e dtm r e dtm r is the elevation value stored in a dem cell while e r is the average elevation calculated on it within a kernel computing the numerical difference between a smoothed version of the dem and the original rea maps the local reliefs and concavities of the surface it allows identifying an elevation variation between the bed of the ditch and the surrounding surface located at a higher altitude in this way it is possible to identify the ditch thalwegs and map the spatial distribution of the drainage system within the study area according to tarolli et al 2012 for dem based feature identification and extraction the kernel size should be about twice three times of the dimension of the investigated element in the case of agricultural ditches which in the study area have an average width of 1 m a 31 31 cells kernel corresponding to 3 1 3 1 m was used in particular the mapping of the drainage network was carried out using a threshold above which a pixel is classified as ditch identified by the standard deviation of the rea as proposed by cazorzi et al 2013 in this way it is possible to map any sharp change rapidly and effectively in the surface elevation allowing the identification of even the smallest draining element at large scales 3 3 2 roughness index roughness is a word used in several scientific disciplines smith 2014 and its meaning varies considerably from the type of application and spatial resolution vetter et al 2011 woodget et al 2018 in remote sensing and geomorphology it can be defined as a dem based geomorphological indicator expression of the spatial variability of a topographic surface at a given scale grohmann et al 2011 in this work the roughness index was assessed as proposed by cavalli et al 2008 i e by spatializing the standard deviation of the residual topography calculated as follows eq 2 2 σ i 1 n x i x m 2 n where σ is the roughness index n is the number of cells of the moving windows used to smooth the original dem for the residual topography calculation x i is the value of the original dem and x m is the average value of the cells within the window as for the rea also for the roughness index calculation a kernel of 31 31 cells was used to ensure that its size was about three times the width of ditches the roughness index was calculated on a polygon mask i e 1 m wide based on the feature extraction performed by rea values considering a buffer of 0 5 m from the middle of the ditches 3 3 3 in ditch vegetation detection the identification of vegetation in the drainage network is proposed based on the statistical interpretation of the roughness index values first 27 gnss points were plotted on orthophoto measured in areas where the vegetation obstructs the channels ensuring that there was correspondence between what was seen in the field and what can be observed on orthophoto then for each gnss point the value of roughness index was sampled creating a list of σ data the minimum value of roughness index in the data base i e 0 28 m was used as a threshold values to reclassify the roughness map discretizing pixels pixels with value higher than the threshold were classified as vegetation by the proposed method becoming a tool for the identification of vegetation at the farm scale 3 4 statistical validation the statistical validation through r software aims at assessing the effectiveness of the proposed method in the quick identification of the vegetation that obstructs the channels it was performed using the roughness index sampled at 27 gnss points measured in vegetated canals hereinafter real points and at 100 points randomly distributed within the drainage network random points for each type of point a list containing the extracted roughness index values was created the first analysis was qualitative and performed on the random points dataset each point was classified as vegetation or clean ditch in two ways the first by observing if the roughness index value is higher than the identified threshold see section 3 3 3 the second by manually classifying the point based on the orthophoto observing whether or not vegetation is present at that point in this way it was possible to compare the result of the classification obtained by the proposed method with a real based dataset as reference the performance with which the method is able to classify a point as vegetation or clean ditch is assessed by the confusion matrix binary reported in table 2 tp true positive is the number of points classified as vegetation in both the comparison and the reference list similar fp false positive is the number of points classified as clean ditch fn false negative is the number of points classified as vegetation in the reference but clean ditch in the comparison list finally tn true negative is the number of points classified in both lists as clean ditch using the values provided by the matrix the following measures were performed to assess the performance of the classification as indicated by sokolova et al 2006 and sokolova and lapalme 2009 in particular accuracy eq 3 measures the overall effectiveness of the classifier while precision eq 4 the class agreement of the data labels with the positive labels given by the classifier the effectiveness of the method on identifying a positive label is measured by recall or sensitivity eq 5 while a negative label by specificity eq 6 f score eq 7 analyses the relationships between positive data labels and those provided by the classifier resulting in balanced for β 1 while favours precision for β 1 and recall for β 1 auc or area under the curves eq 8 the ability of the method to avoid false classifications the effectiveness of the classification method was also evaluated through the quality index proposed in eq 9 heipke et al 1997 specifically q varies from 0 to 1 with 1 representing a perfect overlap between the two datasets i e when the method identifies the vegetation in the channel in an optimal way 3 accuracy tp tn tp tn fp fn 4 precision tp tp f p 5 sensitivity recall tp tp fn 6 specificity tn fp tn 7 f score β 2 1 tp β 2 1 tp β 2 fn fp 8 auc 1 2 tp tp fn tn tn fp 9 q tp tp fp fn a second analysis performed was quantitative and aims to compare the roughness index values sampled for real and random points since most of the channels in the study area are free of vegetation it is more likely that the 100 random points fall within non vegetated areas rather than vegetated for this reason it was evaluated whether the roughness index values found in the real points vegetated therefore tending to high values of roughness index are significantly and statistically different from the values extracted in the random points mainly not vegetated tending to low values of roughness index the comparison of the two sets of data was performed with the f and t tests fisher 1992 student 1908 the f test is used to compare the standard deviations between two normally distributed data sets and to test the hypothesis that they have the same variance the t test is used to compare the means of these data sets and to test whether they differ from a reference value rejecting the null hypotheses of both tests confirms that the two data sets are statistically different if this occurs it means that roughness index may be an interesting indicator to consider for the mapping of vegetation induced obstructions 4 result and discussion 4 1 data processing and dem generation the processing of sfm data led to the generation of a dense point cloud 99 532 980 points with a mean density of 195 points m2 a detail tiled model fig 3a and b an orthophoto of the study area with 0 05 m resolution used to interpret the presence of vegetation in the field and a high resolution dem at 0 10 m fig 3c d and e the statistics reported in table 3 shows how the interpolation process slightly increased the errors in dem data compared to the errors at the point cloud level it is well known that gridding processes may induce a loss of resolution and increase errors with respect to the original data chaplot et al 2006 heritage et al 2009 crema et al 2020 the wide range of calculated metrics allowed a more robust error estimation especially after the outlier removal that made the statistics more reliable as several authors highlighted höhle and höhle 2009 gonçalves et al 2018 tmušić et al 2020 as can be observed from the evaluation of the errors in table 3 the sfm technique has proved to be valid and robust in the digital modelling of the terrain resulting in suitable for the purposes of this work offering high resolution and quality data uav sfm technology is a low time consuming and low cost solution for large areas surveys and permits frequent monitoring of vegetation evolution in ditches other more expensive and detailer techniques e g als were used in the past to monitor water levels of vegetated ditches roelens et al 2016 in the extended agrarian landscape with the possibility to identify ground non ground and water thanks to full waveform lidar capabilities however in this case for a rapid vegetation detection sfm technique was appropriate to survey the surface elevations and obstructions as is possible to see in fig 3a and b in the drainage networks similar outcomes were emphasised by vinatier et al 2018 that tested sfm technique to quantify the blockage factor of flow by vegetation inside bed channels across time and water levels they used terrestrial sfm fixing the camera on a pole that enabled surveys to be carried out at an even lower cost very frequent and more detailed but on areas not very large compared to those detected by uav moreover uav sfm technology exploiting the benefits of the direct georeferencing ppk data benassi et al 2017 carbonneau and dietrich 2017 cucchiaro et al 2020 enables the surveys to be even more expeditious and the status of the drainage network to be constantly monitored and updated in terms of vegetation management a further tool that could be mounted on a uav is a multi spectral camera with which it would be possible to study the presence of vegetation using different indices and multiband orthomosaics strecha et al 2012 candiago et al 2015 stow et al 2019 multi spectral technology could be exploited to identify vegetation in channel networks but this would require additional economic and computational costs moving away from a low cost flexible and large scale workflow 4 2 drainage network extraction the drainage system was extracted from the rea raster using a standard deviation based threshold identified at 0 024 m as described in section 3 1 the result is shown in fig 4b used as a reference with the orthomosaic realised from uav fig 4a survey for drawing the final channels network in fig 4c as can be observed the distribution of the network is clearly visible in the map and can be used for the exhaustive plotting of the ditches many studies in literature propose dem based hydrographic network extraction using the local slopes such as the d8 algorithm but they fail when facing discontinuities in flat areas or pits hou et al 2011 wang et al 2019 rea can overcome such problems because it does not use slope but is based on the relative difference between dems resulting optimal for flat landscapes indeed it exploits the ditches depressions as surface footprints for network mapping other authors successfully applied this methodology and obtained similar outcomes both for ditches extraction in the agrarian landscape and water storage capacity quantification in anthropogenic regions sofia et al 2014 moreover it is important to assess the elevation profile detection in the approach useful for countless analyses at the hydraulic cross section level pramanik et al 2010 for this reason in addition to the planimetric mapping of the drainage network the method was tested to draw the elevation profiles of the channels and to evaluate the quality of the final extraction as in cazorzi et al 2013 an in deep analysis was performed using the cross section a a within the study area fig 5a and b the distributions of the elevation values for the original and smoothed dtm as well as about the rea are illustrated in the boxplots of fig 5c the smoothed version of the dem has a lower range of values than the original because of the use of the kernel while the rea has values concentrated around zero except for peaks in depressed areas the bed of the ditches or areas at higher elevations such as the banks elevation values for original and smoothed dem at the section a a level is reported in fig 5d from the observation of orthophoto and sections at the same scale the method clearly identifies the depressed shape of the ditch specifically looking at the area of the graph greater than the threshold and under the rea curve is possible to identify the extension of the ditch as can be observed rea permits interesting insights in drainage network extraction in plain landscapes as well as notable from the cross and longitudinal sections analysis a fundamental aspect for an effective drainage network mapping is the dem quality and resolution different research used dems for this aim with different spatial scales and techniques for example in large basins the channels can be extracted automatically by dem processed by satellite reddy et al 2018 a method also tested on taiwanese catchments lin et al 2006 for smaller areas als data was used to effectively detect drain features bailly et al 2008 2011 roelens et al 2018 liu and zhang 2011 but these solutions do not allow frequent and low cost survey therefore this work demonstrated how the rea indicator applied at a high resolution and farm scale dem generated by uav sfm despite the limitations of the technique such as the problems of penetrating the vegetation to detect the terrain was a valid answer for network extraction 4 3 vegetation detection once the drainage network was detected the areas where vegetation obstructs the section of the channel were investigated through the surface roughness index fig 6 the no data of roughness index patterns indicate areas with vegetation below the threshold of 0 28 m and considered as not significant for this work see section 3 3 3 instead from light green to red i e hotspot indicates vegetation with increasing height the effectiveness of the proposed method for the identification of in ditch vegetation was also tested using longitudinal profiles within the drainage network fig 7 shows an analysis of two of them fig 7a and b one vegetated section b b fig 7c and one free of vegetation section c c fig 7d fig 7e and f plot the residual topography in the longitudinal profiles of the two samples in the first the roughness index represented in the graph as residual topography is greater values greater than the threshold represented by the dashed red line fig 7e and f are marked by the method as vegetation on the contrary for the not vegetated ditch the method correctly classifies the areas as clean ditch in addition the distribution of elevation values is different between the two samples as observable in the probability density functions pdf in fig 7g and h the range of values is greater for the vegetated channel than in the non vegetated for this reason it is interesting to analyse values of roughness index as a discriminating element for effective and farm scale mapping of ditches obstructed by vegetation in studies mainly aimed at the hydraulic impact of the vegetation within the drainage network the roughness index is often referred to the manning coefficient for water flow resistance estimation forzieri et al 2010 however studying vegetation as an element capable of altering the water flow in the drainage channels is not the main goal of this work the novelty of our research is to observe in a similar context the roughness index not as a hydrodynamic parameter but as a geomorphometric feature of sharp alteration in the surface elevation other studies used roughness to better understand topography and features in agriculture davenport et al 2004 gilliot et al 2017 and had similar useful outcomes in line with the concept of roughness itself which depends on the spatial scale the method optimizes the classification based on the size of the channels in this way the technique can recognise the vegetation as an external element in the ditch geometry and exploit this approach to map the critical hotspots in the network this aspect also offers interesting insights indeed it is possible to target the method by finding useful applications in similar contexts by adjusting the kernel size used to compute the roughness index this could be the case for example of man made watercourses of larger size in lowland agricultural landscapes 4 4 method statistical assessment the effectiveness of the roughness index for the obstructed ditches mapping was assessed through two statistical tests the distributions of the roughness index of real and random points are graphically reported in fig 8 as well as the main statistical descriptors in table 4 the results of the different indicators are summarised in table 5a the first statistical assessment refers to the random points dataset as it is possible to observe the method is generally accurate and precise in the classification of a point as vegetation or clean ditch accuracy and precision greater than 80 with a quality index equal to 46 sensitivity greater than 50 indicates good effectiveness in positive labels identification therefore vegetated points the same is valid for non vegetated points therefore classified with a negative label as the specificity exceeds 90 besides the f score assumes values above 60 maximum for β less than 1 to strengthen the ability of the method in identifying positive labels the auc greater than 70 also indicates a general capacity of the classifier to avoid false classifications the second evaluation aims at comparing the series of real and random points roughness index to detect a statistically significant difference observing the boxplots in fig 8 it can be noticed a remarkable distinction between the two distributions with tendentially higher values of roughness index for the series of real points therefore characterised by the vegetation in the drainage system this happens because since in the study area most of the channels are free from vegetation the probability that a random point falls in a vegetated area is low for this reason if the two sets of values are statistically different this suggests that the method can identify vegetated hotspots by observing regions with high value of roughness index moreover the use of random points in addition to those sampled in the field allowed additional considerations and further validation of the observed results the difference between the two sets of data is measured using the two well known f and t tests shown in table 5b as can be observed in the f test the null hypothesis is rejected because f is greater than critical f showing differentiation between the series this also happens with the t test which states that there is a difference between the averages of the two data sets for these reasons the two arrays are considered statistically different highlighting how the use of a dem based roughness index can be a discriminatory variable in the mapping of vegetation in the ditches system it must be stressed that this methodology could be applied to different types of vegetation typical of different climates and geographical areas of the world because it only exploits the geometric characteristics present along the ditches however an initial inspection of the study area is essential to assess the type of vegetation present the typical conditions for which obstruction occurs and those of functional channels to broadly calibrate the discriminating threshold in the assessment of critical points based on the roughness index the proposed workflow could be implemented in the future to become an interesting methodology for continuous monitoring of vegetation in ditches indeed once the drainage network is extracted it is possible to plan periodic uav sfm surveys over them fixing gcps in stable areas to avoid repeated gnss measurements in the field in this way stakeholders would access a quick and low cost tool to identify critical channel sections and schedule maintenance more efficiently 5 conclusions the vegetation obstruction in the ditch cross sections could be a huge issue in terms of the drainage networks efficiency and storage capacity and hydrological response related to flood risk in the agrarian landscape the knowledge of the potentially critical areas where rapid interventions are needed is a key tool this research presented a flexible and low cost method for vegetation detection in channels exploiting high resolution topographic technologies as uav sfm photogrammetric technique that allowed us to realise a detailed dem and reach the needed quality at farm scale the uav sfm proved to be effective in monitoring the presence of vegetation in the drainage network in a large agrarian landscape of 51 ha the accurate and high resolution dem were fundamental to derive geomorphometric indicators as rea and roughness index rea permitted an efficient extraction of the drainage network of the study area then a roughness index was used for the in ditches vegetation detection through statistical analysis the roughness index parameter was tested as a geomorphometric feature of sharp alteration in the surface elevation the high values of roughness index due to the presence of vegetation in the ditches were identified and compared with corresponding measurements in the field to validate and assess the methodology the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach and underline how the developed workflow could provide on a farm scale and with an unusually high level of detail extremely useful and low cost information to map vegetation obstruction in channel network once the drainage network is extracted for a given area the proposed workflow could be further expedited and automated by fixing gcps in stable zones and carrying out rapid uav sfm surveys that would provide constant and low cost monitoring of hot spot areas this data could become essential at stakeholders to precisely intervene on obstruction points to ensure the efficiency of the irrigation and water resource management planning the ditches maintenance moreover this research could give useful information to test the flooding capacity of a ditch system and identify some numerical benchmarks to be included in flood risk models and the computations of the storage size of the drainage network declaration of competing interest

9927,drainage network efficiency plays a key role in terms of irrigation and control of floods generation in cultivated areas a crucial aspect to consider in water resource and flood management risk is the assessment of the network storage capacity the latter can be reduced by the uncontrolled growth of vegetation that can modify the ditch cross section altering the hydrological response and network functionality therefore the continuous monitoring of the potentially critical areas where vegetation could obstruct the section become a fundamental point that can be solved by the advanced in the high resolution topographic technologies in the last few years the exploration of structure from motion sfm photogrammetry technique in parallel with uncrewed aerial vehicles uavs have increased the possibilities for the realisation of rapid low cost and very detailed digital elevation models dem the accurate and high resolution dem generated by uav sfm survey is fundamental to derive geomorphometric features of the agrarian landscape this research aims to present a flexible and low cost workflow to generate an accurate and high resolution uav sfm dem in a large agrarian area of taiwan that can be used to automatically detect the drainage network and to map the vegetation into the ditches through the roughness index the high roughness index values due to the presence of

networks are very common elements in lowland agricultural landscapes all over the world they play a key role in reducing waterlogging and water erosion purifying water improving groundwater recharge and support water supply in cultivated areas dollinger et al 2015 pijl et al 2018 roelens et al 2016 drainage networks within floodplains constitute man made surface s discontinuities that influence surface runoff overland flow paths and water transfer cazorzi et al 2013 levavasseur et al 2012 therefore these agricultural structures have an important function in terms of control of floods generation moussa et al 2002 sofia et al 2014 along with ditch networks that are more and more incorporated in water solute runoff models roelens et al 2018 a crucial aspect to consider in models for flood management risk is the assessment of the network storage capacity low values of channel storage capacity can underline deficits in the network and they can outline areas whose hydrological behaviour is potentially critical during floods malano and van hofwegen 1999 several studies have shown the high sensitivity of the hydrologic response of a catchment to the geometry of ditches sections roelens et al 2016 in this context vegetation plays a primary role its presence may be due to inadequate maintenance of the drainage network or considerable ponding phenomena caused by the incorrect design of channel slopes vegetation is fundamental for wet and aquatic habitats in lowland landscapes herzon and helenius 2008 van geert et al 2010 dollinger et al 2015 restoring river environment rhee et al 2008 and reduce sediment transport rates due to physical creep processes rain splash dry ravel and expansion and contraction of sediments istanbulluoglu and bras 2005 nevertheless vegetation modifies the ditch cross section altering the hydrological response and network functionality nepf 2012 aberle and järvelä 2013 indeed according to errico et al 2019 the presence of an undisturbed vegetation community significantly rises the water levels thus possibly increasing the flood risk moreover errico et al 2018 stated that vegetation influences the flow velocity and turbulence as well as the roughness of the bed and banks specifically they vary in function of the vegetated element flexibility their submergence in water and the density aberle and järvelä 2013 ghisalberti et al 2002 rhee et al 2008 takemura and tanaka 2007 a large body of literature attempts to characterise vegetation functional traits affecting hydraulic rugosity through the introduction of the blockage factor of flow by vegetation vinatier et al 2017 vastila et al 2011 confirmed and showed that leaves contributed to almost 90 of the total flow drag highlighting the changes in terms of the vegetation induced roughness in the drainage network it is essential to balance the ecosystem services with the hydraulic safety of the channels through sustainable management needelman et al 2007 for this reason it is important to know which are the potentially critical areas where vegetation could obstruct the section and modify drainage networks storage capacity this last aspect could be quickly identified by analysing roughness patterns in the drainage network as this parameter is strongly linked to the presence or absence of vegetation in the channels errico et al 2018 in recent decades spatial mapping spatial variation in surface roughness has been applied increasingly in planetary science to determine signatures of surface processes smith 2014 advances in remote sensing contributed to the development of more accurate and fast methodologies to compute the surface roughness using high resolution topographic hrt data for example airborne laser scanning als which uses light detection and ranging lidar technology was used to estimate at large scale the surface roughness through digital elevation models dem mckean and roering 2004 smith et al 2004 glenn et al 2006 frankel and dolan 2007 cavalli et al 2008 whilst smith et al 2011 carried out terrestrial laser scanning tls surveys to examine at a detailed scale the ability of a variety of roughness measures to predict the resistance to overland flows in the last few years the exploration of structure from motion sfm photogrammetry technique paired with multiview stereo mvs algorithms hereafter referred together as sfm in parallel with the use of uncrewed aerial vehicles uavs increased the possibilities for rapid low cost and very detailed surveys of environmental features westoby et al 2012 carrivick et al 2016 moreover this last technology exploits the benefits of the direct georeferencing dg method thanks to onboard multifrequency gnss receivers for uavs and postprocessing kinematic ppk data reducing the substantial inconvenience and cost of ground control point gcp placement in extensive or inaccessible areas cucchiaro et al 2020 in this way dems can be easily used to obtain the characterisation of a channel for hydrological modelling and the automatic detection of the drainage network bailly et al 2008 passalacqua et al 2012 cazorzi et al 2013 hooshyar et al 2015 that is the basic data to quickly identify the surface roughness patterns in agricultural ditches this research aims to present a fast low cost and flexible method for vegetation detection in channels that could potentially represent critical hot spots in the drainage network at the agricultural landscape scale taking advantage of uav sfm technology a methodological workflow was developed to realise a high resolution dem useful to identify ditches and channels through morphological approaches carturan et al 2009 cazorzi et al 2013 and to calculate the surface roughness as the standard deviation of residual topography cavalli et al 2008 the high roughness values due to the presence of vegetation in the ditches were identified and compared with corresponding measurements in the field that allowed the validation and the assessment of the methodology the developed workflow could provide on a large scale and with an unusually high level of detail useful information at stakeholders for the management of drainage network and flood risk even underlining the hot spot points with low storage capacity of ditches due to uncontrolled growth of vegetation 2 study areas the study area is located in the village of ruisui 23 29 05 n 121 23 49 e in hualien county central eastern taiwan fig 1a and b the climate in this region is humid and sub tropical the 70 of the year s runoff is concentrated in the rainy season from may to october starting from october the precipitation decreases resulting in a dry season until april yeh et al 2016 the study area is located on the hongye river one of the tributaries of the xiuguluan river fundamental for the agricultural activity of the region agriculture is one of the main economic sectors in the country and cultivated land is over 15 of the surface chen et al 2019 the research area covers about 51 ha ha of which 4 ha is forest 3 ha is urban area and 44 ha is cultivated land mainly used for horticulture fruit trees and tea plantations the surveyed area is in a flat landscape and the rainwater excess is collected in a network of ditches about 21 5 km long the agricultural drainage network generally consists of main sub main and lateral channels these structures are located at the edges of the fields within the parcels and along the main roads the system drains water into the hongye river through culverts located under the main road the average width of the ditches is about 1 m while the depth varies from 0 50 m to 1 m with a rectangular section in the study area three orders of channels have been identified the main drains like those that develop along the roads are in concrete the second and third order drains are open channel dug into the soil although there is a general tendency to remove vegetation from the ditches the poor maintenance resulted in obstruction by vegetation of some sections of the drainage network fig 1c and d small bushes can be seen at the bottom up to larger shrubs even over 1 5 m high 3 methods this study investigated the feasibility of vegetation mapping in the drainage network at the farm landscape scale through morphometric indicators such as roughness that were statistically assessed using a high resolution orthophoto and in field sample measurements 3 1 data acquisition the photogrammetric survey was carried out in january 2019 under sufficiently lush

surface through the statistical outliers removal sor filter afterwards the point cloud was filtered manually removing unwanted objects e g buildings isolated trees and crops the point clouds were decimated in order to reduce the processing constraints and the extremely high density of the 3d cloud through the geostatistical topography point cloud analysis toolkit topcat successfully used in several studies e g javernick et al 2014 vericat et al 2014 this tool decomposes the point cloud into a set of non overlapping grid cells calculating the statistics for the observations in each grid the minimum elevation within each grid cell was taken to be the ground elevation and a grid cell of 0 10 m was selected to regularise the data set as in brasington et al 2012 the decimated point clouds were used to calculate a triangular irregular network tin that was then converted to a raster through a natural neighbour interpolator resulting in one single dem for the whole study area the output error assessment was a fundamental part of sfm post processing to highlight possible bias and different aspects were considered to analyse the accuracy and precision of the outputs first the sfm point cloud uncertainty was evaluated on gcps and cps considering the residuals of each point i e the difference between the real coordinates of this point measured with the gnss in the field and the modelled sfm values the mean of the residuals provides an indication of the accuracy of the registration process and the point cloud when the gcp and cp residuals are respectively considered instead the standard deviation of the residuals is an indication of the precision cucchiaro et al 2018 to assess uncertainties usually caused by the gridding process especially in the vertical component a statistical comparison test was calculated between randomly selected z values of cps and compared to equivalent z value measurements from dem following the approach of höhle and höhle 2009 the outliers were removed by applying a threshold selected from an initial calculation of the error measures then the root mean square errors rmse standard deviation sde mean error me and the normalized median absolute deviation nmad a robust estimator for the sde more resilient to outliers in the dataset gonçalves et al 2018 cucchiaro et al 2020 were calculated 3 3 morphometric indexes calculation 3 3 1 rea drainage network extraction dem based automatic extraction of the drainage network in agricultural landscapes is an outstanding alternative to the obsolete manual analysis of topographic maps garbrecht and martz 1994 for this purpose the geomorphological indicator relative elevation attribute rea was applied on the high resolution dem rea can be performed according to the following eq 1 as proposed by carturan et al 2009 1 rea r e r e dtm r e dtm r is the elevation value stored in a dem cell while e r is the average elevation calculated on it within a kernel computing the numerical difference between a smoothed version of the dem and the original rea maps the local reliefs and concavities of the surface it allows identifying an elevation variation between the bed of the ditch and the surrounding surface located at a higher altitude in this way it is possible to identify the ditch thalwegs and map the spatial distribution of the drainage system within the study area according to tarolli et al 2012 for dem based feature identification and extraction the kernel size should be about twice three times of the dimension of the investigated element in the case of agricultural ditches which in the study area have an average width of 1 m a 31 31 cells kernel corresponding to 3 1 3 1 m was used in particular the mapping of the drainage network was carried out using a threshold above which a pixel is classified as ditch identified by the standard deviation of the rea as proposed by cazorzi et al 2013 in this way it is possible to map any sharp change rapidly and effectively in the surface elevation allowing the identification of even the smallest draining element at large scales 3 3 2 roughness index roughness is a word used in several scientific disciplines smith 2014 and its meaning varies considerably from the type of application and spatial resolution vetter et al 2011 woodget et al 2018 in remote sensing and geomorphology it can be defined as a dem based geomorphological indicator expression of the spatial variability of a topographic surface at a given scale grohmann et al 2011 in this work the roughness index was assessed as proposed by cavalli et al 2008 i e by spatializing the standard deviation of the residual topography calculated as follows eq 2 2 σ i 1 n x i x m 2 n where σ is the roughness index n is the number of cells of the moving windows used to smooth the original dem for the residual topography calculation x i is the value of the original dem and x m is the average value of the cells within the window as for the rea also for the roughness index calculation a kernel of 31 31 cells was used to ensure that its size was about three times the width of ditches the roughness index was calculated on a polygon mask i e 1 m wide based on the feature extraction performed by rea values considering a buffer of 0 5 m from the middle of the ditches 3 3 3 in ditch vegetation detection the identification of vegetation in the drainage network is proposed based on the statistical interpretation of the roughness index values first 27 gnss points were plotted on orthophoto measured in areas where the vegetation obstructs the channels ensuring that there was correspondence between what was seen in the field and what can be observed on orthophoto then for each gnss point the value of roughness index was sampled creating a list of σ data the minimum value of roughness index in the data base i e 0 28 m was used as a threshold values to reclassify the roughness map discretizing pixels pixels with value higher than the threshold were classified as vegetation by the proposed method becoming a tool for the identification of vegetation at the farm scale 3 4 statistical validation the statistical validation through r software aims at assessing the effectiveness of the proposed method in the quick identification of the vegetation that obstructs the channels it was performed using the roughness index sampled at 27 gnss points measured in vegetated canals hereinafter real points and at 100 points randomly distributed within the drainage network random points for each type of point a list containing the extracted roughness index values was created the first analysis was qualitative and performed on the random points dataset each point was classified as vegetation or clean ditch in two ways the first by observing if the roughness index value is higher than the identified threshold see section 3 3 3 the second by manually classifying the point based on the orthophoto observing whether or not vegetation is present at that point in this way it was possible to compare the result of the classification obtained by the proposed method with a real based dataset as reference the performance with which the method is able to classify a point as vegetation or clean ditch is assessed by the confusion matrix binary reported in table 2 tp true positive is the number of points classified as vegetation in both the comparison and the reference list similar fp false positive is the number of points classified as clean ditch fn false negative is the number of points classified as vegetation in the reference but clean ditch in the comparison list finally tn true negative is the number of points classified in both lists as clean ditch using the values provided by the matrix the following measures were performed to assess the performance of the classification as indicated by sokolova et al 2006 and sokolova and lapalme 2009 in particular accuracy eq 3 measures the overall effectiveness of the classifier while precision eq 4 the class agreement of the data labels with the positive labels given by the classifier the effectiveness of the method on identifying a positive label is measured by recall or sensitivity eq 5 while a negative label by specificity eq 6 f score eq 7 analyses the relationships between positive data labels and those provided by the classifier resulting in balanced for β 1 while favours precision for β 1 and recall for β 1 auc or area under the curves eq 8 the ability of the method to avoid false classifications the effectiveness of the classification method was also evaluated through the quality index proposed in eq 9 heipke et al 1997 specifically q varies from 0 to 1 with 1 representing a perfect overlap between the two datasets i e when the method identifies the vegetation in the channel in an optimal way 3 accuracy tp tn tp tn fp fn 4 precision tp tp f p 5 sensitivity recall tp tp fn 6 specificity tn fp tn 7 f score β 2 1 tp β 2 1 tp β 2 fn fp 8 auc 1 2 tp tp fn tn tn fp 9 q tp tp fp fn a second analysis performed was quantitative and aims to compare the roughness index values sampled for real and random points since most of the channels in the study area are free of vegetation it is more likely that the 100 random points fall within non vegetated areas rather than vegetated for this reason it was evaluated whether the roughness index values found in the real points vegetated therefore tending to high values of roughness index are significantly and statistically different from the values extracted in the random points mainly not vegetated tending to low values of roughness index the comparison of the two sets of data was performed with the f and t tests fisher 1992 student 1908 the f test is used to compare the standard deviations between two normally distributed data sets and to test the hypothesis that they have the same variance the t test is used to compare the means of these data sets and to test whether they differ from a reference value rejecting the null hypotheses of both tests confirms that the two data sets are statistically different if this occurs it means that roughness index may be an interesting indicator to consider for the mapping of vegetation induced obstructions 4 result and discussion 4 1 data processing and dem generation the processing of sfm data led to the generation of a dense point cloud 99 532 980 points with a mean density of 195 points m2 a detail tiled model fig 3a and b an orthophoto of the study area with 0 05 m resolution used to interpret the presence of vegetation in the field and a high resolution dem at 0 10 m fig 3c d and e the statistics reported in table 3 shows how the interpolation process slightly increased the errors in dem data compared to the errors at the point cloud level it is well known that gridding processes may induce a loss of resolution and increase errors with respect to the original data chaplot et al 2006 heritage et al 2009 crema et al 2020 the wide range of calculated metrics allowed a more robust error estimation especially after the outlier removal that made the statistics more reliable as several authors highlighted höhle and höhle 2009 gonçalves et al 2018 tmušić et al 2020 as can be observed from the evaluation of the errors in table 3 the sfm technique has proved to be valid and robust in the digital modelling of the terrain resulting in suitable for the purposes of this work offering high resolution and quality data uav sfm technology is a low time consuming and low cost solution for large areas surveys and permits frequent monitoring of vegetation evolution in ditches other more expensive and detailer techniques e g als were used in the past to monitor water levels of vegetated ditches roelens et al 2016 in the extended agrarian landscape with the possibility to identify ground non ground and water thanks to full waveform lidar capabilities however in this case for a rapid vegetation detection sfm technique was appropriate to survey the surface elevations and obstructions as is possible to see in fig 3a and b in the drainage networks similar outcomes were emphasised by vinatier et al 2018 that tested sfm technique to quantify the blockage factor of flow by vegetation inside bed channels across time and water levels they used terrestrial sfm fixing the camera on a pole that enabled surveys to be carried out at an even lower cost very frequent and more detailed but on areas not very large compared to those detected by uav moreover uav sfm technology exploiting the benefits of the direct georeferencing ppk data benassi et al 2017 carbonneau and dietrich 2017 cucchiaro et al 2020 enables the surveys to be even more expeditious and the status of the drainage network to be constantly monitored and updated in terms of vegetation management a further tool that could be mounted on a uav is a multi spectral camera with which it would be possible to study the presence of vegetation using different indices and multiband orthomosaics strecha et al 2012 candiago et al 2015 stow et al 2019 multi spectral technology could be exploited to identify vegetation in channel networks but this would require additional economic and computational costs moving away from a low cost flexible and large scale workflow 4 2 drainage network extraction the drainage system was extracted from the rea raster using a standard deviation based threshold identified at 0 024 m as described in section 3 1 the result is shown in fig 4b used as a reference with the orthomosaic realised from uav fig 4a survey for drawing the final channels network in fig 4c as can be observed the distribution of the network is clearly visible in the map and can be used for the exhaustive plotting of the ditches many studies in literature propose dem based hydrographic network extraction using the local slopes such as the d8 algorithm but they fail when facing discontinuities in flat areas or pits hou et al 2011 wang et al 2019 rea can overcome such problems because it does not use slope but is based on the relative difference between dems resulting optimal for flat landscapes indeed it exploits the ditches depressions as surface footprints for network mapping other authors successfully applied this methodology and obtained similar outcomes both for ditches extraction in the agrarian landscape and water storage capacity quantification in anthropogenic regions sofia et al 2014 moreover it is important to assess the elevation profile detection in the approach useful for countless analyses at the hydraulic cross section level pramanik et al 2010 for this reason in addition to the planimetric mapping of the drainage network the method was tested to draw the elevation profiles of the channels and to evaluate the quality of the final extraction as in cazorzi et al 2013 an in deep analysis was performed using the cross section a a within the study area fig 5a and b the distributions of the elevation values for the original and smoothed dtm as well as about the rea are illustrated in the boxplots of fig 5c the smoothed version of the dem has a lower range of values than the original because of the use of the kernel while the rea has values concentrated around zero except for peaks in depressed areas the bed of the ditches or areas at higher elevations such as the banks elevation values for original and smoothed dem at the section a a level is reported in fig 5d from the observation of orthophoto and sections at the same scale the method clearly identifies the depressed shape of the ditch specifically looking at the area of the graph greater than the threshold and under the rea curve is possible to identify the extension of the ditch as can be observed rea permits interesting insights in drainage network extraction in plain landscapes as well as notable from the cross and longitudinal sections analysis a fundamental aspect for an effective drainage network mapping is the dem quality and resolution different research used dems for this aim with different spatial scales and techniques for example in large basins the channels can be extracted automatically by dem processed by satellite reddy et al 2018 a method also tested on taiwanese catchments lin et al 2006 for smaller areas als data was used to effectively detect drain features bailly et al 2008 2011 roelens et al 2018 liu and zhang 2011 but these solutions do not allow frequent and low cost survey therefore this work demonstrated how the rea indicator applied at a high resolution and farm scale dem generated by uav sfm despite the limitations of the technique such as the problems of penetrating the vegetation to detect the terrain was a valid answer for network extraction 4 3 vegetation detection once the drainage network was detected the areas where vegetation obstructs the section of the channel were investigated through the surface roughness index fig 6 the no data of roughness index patterns indicate areas with vegetation below the threshold of 0 28 m and considered as not significant for this work see section 3 3 3 instead from light green to red i e hotspot indicates vegetation with increasing height the effectiveness of the proposed method for the identification of in ditch vegetation was also tested using longitudinal profiles within the drainage network fig 7 shows an analysis of two of them fig 7a and b one vegetated section b b fig 7c and one free of vegetation section c c fig 7d fig 7e and f plot the residual topography in the longitudinal profiles of the two samples in the first the roughness index represented in the graph as residual topography is greater values greater than the threshold represented by the dashed red line fig 7e and f are marked by the method as vegetation on the contrary for the not vegetated ditch the method correctly classifies the areas as clean ditch in addition the distribution of elevation values is different between the two samples as observable in the probability density functions pdf in fig 7g and h the range of values is greater for the vegetated channel than in the non vegetated for this reason it is interesting to analyse values of roughness index as a discriminating element for effective and farm scale mapping of ditches obstructed by vegetation in studies mainly aimed at the hydraulic impact of the vegetation within the drainage network the roughness index is often referred to the manning coefficient for water flow resistance estimation forzieri et al 2010 however studying vegetation as an element capable of altering the water flow in the drainage channels is not the main goal of this work the novelty of our research is to observe in a similar context the roughness index not as a hydrodynamic parameter but as a geomorphometric feature of sharp alteration in the surface elevation other studies used roughness to better understand topography and features in agriculture davenport et al 2004 gilliot et al 2017 and had similar useful outcomes in line with the concept of roughness itself which depends on the spatial scale the method optimizes the classification based on the size of the channels in this way the technique can recognise the vegetation as an external element in the ditch geometry and exploit this approach to map the critical hotspots in the network this aspect also offers interesting insights indeed it is possible to target the method by finding useful applications in similar contexts by adjusting the kernel size used to compute the roughness index this could be the case for example of man made watercourses of larger size in lowland agricultural landscapes 4 4 method statistical assessment the effectiveness of the roughness index for the obstructed ditches mapping was assessed through two statistical tests the distributions of the roughness index of real and random points are graphically reported in fig 8 as well as the main statistical descriptors in table 4 the results of the different indicators are summarised in table 5a the first statistical assessment refers to the random points dataset as it is possible to observe the method is generally accurate and precise in the classification of a point as vegetation or clean ditch accuracy and precision greater than 80 with a quality index equal to 46 sensitivity greater than 50 indicates good effectiveness in positive labels identification therefore vegetated points the same is valid for non vegetated points therefore classified with a negative label as the specificity exceeds 90 besides the f score assumes values above 60 maximum for β less than 1 to strengthen the ability of the method in identifying positive labels the auc greater than 70 also indicates a general capacity of the classifier to avoid false classifications the second evaluation aims at comparing the series of real and random points roughness index to detect a statistically significant difference observing the boxplots in fig 8 it can be noticed a remarkable distinction between the two distributions with tendentially higher values of roughness index for the series of real points therefore characterised by the vegetation in the drainage system this happens because since in the study area most of the channels are free from vegetation the probability that a random point falls in a vegetated area is low for this reason if the two sets of values are statistically different this suggests that the method can identify vegetated hotspots by observing regions with high value of roughness index moreover the use of random points in addition to those sampled in the field allowed additional considerations and further validation of the observed results the difference between the two sets of data is measured using the two well known f and t tests shown in table 5b as can be observed in the f test the null hypothesis is rejected because f is greater than critical f showing differentiation between the series this also happens with the t test which states that there is a difference between the averages of the two data sets for these reasons the two arrays are considered statistically different highlighting how the use of a dem based roughness index can be a discriminatory variable in the mapping of vegetation in the ditches system it must be stressed that this methodology could be applied to different types of vegetation typical of different climates and geographical areas of the world because it only exploits the geometric characteristics present along the ditches however an initial inspection of the study area is essential to assess the type of vegetation present the typical conditions for which obstruction occurs and those of functional channels to broadly calibrate the discriminating threshold in the assessment of critical points based on the roughness index the proposed workflow could be implemented in the future to become an interesting methodology for continuous monitoring of vegetation in ditches indeed once the drainage network is extracted it is possible to plan periodic uav sfm surveys over them fixing gcps in stable areas to avoid repeated gnss measurements in the field in this way stakeholders would access a quick and low cost tool to identify critical channel sections and schedule maintenance more efficiently 5 conclusions the vegetation obstruction in the ditch cross sections could be a huge issue in terms of the drainage networks efficiency and storage capacity and hydrological response related to flood risk in the agrarian landscape the knowledge of the potentially critical areas where rapid interventions are needed is a key tool this research presented a flexible and low cost method for vegetation detection in channels exploiting high resolution topographic technologies as uav sfm photogrammetric technique that allowed us to realise a detailed dem and reach the needed quality at farm scale the uav sfm proved to be effective in monitoring the presence of vegetation in the drainage network in a large agrarian landscape of 51 ha the accurate and high resolution dem were fundamental to derive geomorphometric indicators as rea and roughness index rea permitted an efficient extraction of the drainage network of the study area then a roughness index was used for the in ditches vegetation detection through statistical analysis the roughness index parameter was tested as a geomorphometric feature of sharp alteration in the surface elevation the high values of roughness index due to the presence of vegetation in the ditches were identified and compared with corresponding measurements in the field to validate and assess the methodology the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach and underline how the developed workflow could provide on a farm scale and with an unusually high level of detail extremely useful and low cost information to map vegetation obstruction in channel network once the drainage network is extracted for a given area the proposed workflow could be further expedited and automated by fixing gcps in stable zones and carrying out rapid uav sfm surveys that would provide constant and low cost monitoring of hot spot areas this data could become essential at stakeholders to precisely intervene on obstruction points to ensure the efficiency of the irrigation and water resource management planning the ditches maintenance moreover this research could give useful information to test the flooding capacity of a ditch system and identify some numerical benchmarks to be included in flood risk models and the computations of the storage size of the drainage network declaration of competing interest

9928,global water resources are under tremendous pressure influenced by population growth and economic development considering that the agricultural sector accounts for the largest consumption and that china is one of the major agricultural countries this study conducted an impact oriented water footprint analysis to quantify the environmental burdens of crop production in china from a life cycle perspective the temporal variation of potential environmental impacts during 2008 2017 was evaluated and 334 cities in china were used to investigate the spatial characteristics of environmental burdens results showed that the environmental burdens were mainly ascribed to direct consumption fertilizer production and diesel production the overall burdens uninterruptedly increased from 2008 to 2015 and then declined in 2016 the decomposition results of temporal variation demonstrated that agricultural economic scale and crop productivity were the largest positive and negative contributors to burden growth respectively the burdens exhibited an evident spatial autocorrelation and high high agglomerations were mostly located in the north china plain and yangtze river delta due to the superior natural resource endowments and dense population in these regions such factors as natural resource endowments i e cultivated land and precipitation agricultural input intensity i e fertilizer and diesel and effective irrigation area proportion significantly influenced the spatial variation of environmental impacts at the city level therefore adopting water saving technologies strengthening fertilization management promoting large scale and mechanized agriculture and choosing clean alternative fuels are highly recommended to achieve sustainable agricultural development furthermore in consideration of the dominance of high high clusters in crop production in china advanced and eco friendly production technologies should be vigorously incentivized in these regions to enhance their agglomeration and radiation force keywords water footprint crop production china city level life cycle assessment 1 introduction global water demand driven by population growth socioeconomic development and changing consumption patterns is projected to increase by 55 between 2000 and 2050 unesco 2020 water scarcity one of the global risks of highest concern will continue to aggravate with the rising water demand and changing climate hoekstra 2014 the agricultural sector is the largest consumer of water resources and contributes to approximately two thirds of the global freshwater withdrawal fao 2014 finogenova et al 2019 agricultural water demand is predicted to grow rapidly under the situation without policy interventions pastor et al 2019 therefore the agricultural sector has a decisive influence on coping with the water scarcity crisis as one of the major agricultural countries in the world china currently faces severe water pressure due to its rapid development and urbanization the agricultural sector accounts for approximately 60 of total water use in china mwr 2019 and 85 of total agricultural water use is ascribed to water for crops yu et al 2021 the leaching of fertilizers and pesticides in crop production further aggravates the water scarcity in china zhang et al 2018 hence identifying the current situation e g environmental impacts and key factors of water consumption and pollution during crop production is highly necessary to address the water scarcity issue and facilitate sustainable agricultural development in china water footprint originally proposed by hoekstra hoekstra 2003 is used to assess the impacts of human activities on freshwater appropriation volumetric and impact oriented methods are the two methods widely used in water footprint analysis berger and finkbeiner 2013 borsato et al 2019 jefferies et al 2012 the volumetric method aims to support enhanced water management and allocation hoekstra 2016 the impact oriented method which is developed by the life cycle assessment community and formalized in the iso standard bayart et al 2010 iso 6 1404 2014 mainly focuses on assessing the potential environmental impacts associated with water availability and degradation from a life cycle perspective most previous studies have adopted the volumetric method to quantify the water footprint of crop production at the inventory level zhao and chen 2014 cao et al 2020 xu et al 2015 or assessed the environmental performance of specific crops via the impact oriented method zhai et al 2019b bai et al 2021a huang et al 2014 however in depth analysis of the overall crop production via the impact oriented method to perform comparative analysis and explore key factors is scarce to reveal the key factors behind the changes in water footprint analysis results over time methods that identify the driving forces of temporal changes should be employed the logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi decomposition method introduced by ang 2004 can be employed to decompose the impacts without residuals this method was initially and extensively applied to analyze the driving factors of energy consumption and co2 emissions chong et al 2019 gu et al 2019 although recent studies have proved its applicability in volumetric water footprint analysis zhao and chen 2014 xu et al 2015 no studies have explored the changes in impact oriented water footprint analysis via the lmdi method previous works have assessed the water footprint of crop production in china primarily at the national zhao and chen 2014 or provincial level cao et al 2020 song et al 2019 but a more accurate and targeted implementation of agricultural management requires the evaluation of the water footprint at a more detailed scale e g river basin or city level zeng et al 2012 quantified the water footprint within heihe river basin china and indicated that crop production accounted for 92 of the total water footprint wang et al 2019b assessed the water pollution during crop production in chizhou city china but only considered the impacts of nitrogen fertilizer leaching xu et al 2015 assessed the water footprint of six typical crops in beijing china ma et al 2020 explored the spatiotemporal characteristics of water footprint requirement in zhangjiakou china china is a vast country with considerable topographical and economic diversity among cities consequently the potential environmental burdens of crop production in each city are different zhou et al 2018 a wide city level water footprint analysis is conducive to exploring the spatial characteristics of the burdens and implementing differentiated and targeted mitigation measures therefore this study performs an impact oriented water footprint analysis of crop production in china to provide a holistic picture of the impacts associated with water i e water consumption and pollution china s regional water resources environment and geographic conditions are considered in the water footprint analysis method in this study to quantify the environmental performance at the macro level and demonstrate the spatial variations from a city level perspective key factors contributing to water related environmental impacts are identified from a methodological point of view lmdi and spatial autocorrelation analysis are used to identify the driving factors and determine hotspots respectively this study provides valuable insights into agricultural management from an environmental perspective at the macro level and a reference for formulating targeted policies for local governments 2 methodology 2 1 system boundary and functional unit the system boundary was established via a cradle to gate approach in this study as shown in fig 1 raw material production energy generation transport and pollutants discharged from crop production process were considered whereas straw treatment process was not involved due to small contribution and unavailable data zhai et al 2019a annual crop production was selected as the functional unit to provide the counting base for the inventory and analysis results 2 2 analysis methods 2 2 1 water footprint analysis water footprint analysis was conducted at midpoint and endpoint levels to evaluate the potential impacts related to water availability and degradation in crop production the regional situation in china was considered in the calculation of the characterization factors of midpoint categories the water scarcity category was adopted for water availability analysis and its impact was calculated following our previous research zhai et al 2021a 2021b 1 i w s w f w w w v w e r w f w d i w i n 1 r w d i w d where i ws w in and w d are the water scarcity impact indirect water consumption and direct water consumption respectively w f w w w v and w e refer to freshwater withdrawals wastewater discharges synthetically created vapor and evaporation respectively which are all based on the information of chinese regional water resources r represents the internal evaporation recycling and wdi means water deprivation index the remaining five categories were used to assess the potential impacts caused by water degradation and their characterization factors were obtained from the research of ma et al 2019 who integrated china s environmental and geographic situations into calculations in terms of endpoint two endpoint categories i e human health and ecosystem quality were selected as the two areas of protection table a 1 and deduced by using midpoint categories through the relationships presented by the recipe 2016 model huijbregts et al 2017 the aforementioned water footprint analysis was implemented via the simapro 8 4 software sensitivity analysis was also conducted in this study to analyze the influence degree of input variables on output results 2 s i δ o u t p u t i δ i n p u t i δ o o δ i i where s i is the sensitivity of the variation of output output i to the variation of input parameter input i o and i represent the relative change in the output and input respectively and o and i are the initial output and input respectively 2 2 2 lmdi analysis lmdi method is an index decomposition analysis method based on the divisia index and can decompose several factors without zero residual errors ang 2004 this method was employed in this study to explore the driving factors behind the temporal changes in water footprint analysis results w it was first decomposed as follows eq 3 3 w w f a a g d p a g d p t g d p t g d p p p d s e p where agdp tgdp and p are the agricultural output value the output value of primary industries i e agriculture forestry animal husbandry and fishery and agricultural population respectively and d s and e represent the crop productivity agricultural structure and agricultural economic scale respectively the additive decomposition approach was then adopted to analyze the overall change in the results w eq 4 4 δ w w t w 0 δ d δ s δ e δ p where w t and w 0 are the results in t and base periods respectively the effects of four driving factors were estimated using the equations below eq 5 5 δ d w t w 0 ln w t ln w 0 ln d t d t δ s w t w 0 ln w t ln w 0 ln s t s 0 δ e w t w 0 ln w t ln w 0 ln e t e 0 δ p w t w 0 ln w t ln w 0 ln p t p 0 on the basis of the formulas above and the water footprint analysis results in the study period the contributions of each driving factor to the time series change in the potential impacts of crop production in china were quantified 2 2 3 spatial autocorrelation analysis global and local moran s i were adopted to investigate the spatial characteristics of the water footprint analysis results at the city level global moran s i is the global indicator for the spatial autocorrelation and ranges from 1 1 a value 0 implies a positive spatial correlation whereas a value 0 implies a negative spatial correlation if the value nears 1 it indicates great spatial clustering inversely a great dispersion situation is presented the formula for calculating global moran s i is shown as follows eq 6 6 m o r a n s i m 1 k n 1 k w m n x m x x n x 1 k m 1 k x m x m 1 k n 1 k w m n x 1 k m 1 k x m where x m and x n refer to the water footprint analysis results of cities m and n respectively k represents the number of cities and w mn is the spatial weight matrix local moran s i was used in this study to examine the distribution pattern of the water footprint analysis results for individual city considering that global moran s i only reflects the differences in spatial average results the formula of local moran s i is expressed as follows 7 m o r a n s i x m x 1 k m 1 k x m x m n k w m n x n x the parameters in eq 7 have the same meanings as those in eq 6 a positive local moran s i value means that the areas are surrounded by similar high or low value areas expressed as high high or low low clusters conversely a negative value implies that high value areas are surrounded by low value areas marked as high low outliers or the areas with low values are surrounded by high value areas i e low high outliers the spatial analysis above was achieved via arcgis and geoda software 2 3 inventory and data sources the national data of irrigation consumption were collected from china water resources bulletins of 2008 2017 mwr 2008 2017 while other agricultural material inputs i e fertilizer pesticide film diesel and electricity were acquired from nbs 2009 2018 the emission coefficients of fertilizer were adopted from the national census of pollutant sources cfpc 2009 the national water footprint inventory of crop production in 2017 is shown in table a 2 based on the defined system boundary and functional unit the national output value and population data for the lmdi analysis were obtained from the national statistical yearbook nbs 2009 2018 given the data availability data of 334 cities were applied in this study to explore the spatial heterogeneity and city level data e g material inputs urbanization precipitation and cultivated land were collected from provincial water resource bulletins table a 3 and statistical bureaus table a 4 chinese regional database cplcid 2020 provided the background data of crop production such as fertilizer production diesel production and transportation 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantification of water footprint analysis results table 1 displays the water footprint analysis results of crop production in china in 2017 with squared geometric standard deviation gsd2 which were used to obtain the variation interval of the results the scope of potential impacts for categories ranged from the division to multiplication of medium and gsd2 values for midpoint categories the medium value and gsd2 of the water scarcity category were 9 74 1010 m3 deprived and 1 30 respectively this result indicated that the fluctuation range of this category was 7 49 1010 1 27 1011 m3 deprived 95 confidence interval similar deductions could be conducted for the remaining categories the medium values were 3 45 103 cases 1 47 103 8 11 103 cases on carcinogens 1 28 104 cases 3 78 103 4 34 104 cases on non

109 kg so2 eq on acidification in terms of endpoint categories the value of human health was 1 38 105 daly with gsd2 of 1 73 therefore the potential impact on human health varied from 7 98 104 daly to 2 39 105 daly likewise the potential impact on ecosystem quality was 1 82 104 species yr varying from 9 43 103 species yr to 3 51 104 species yr gsd2 1 93 the value of irrigation in this study was lower than reported values table 2 these divergent values could be attributed to the different calculation methods and scopes the irrigation consumption accounting in the research of cao et al 2020 was based on a bottom up approach the authors considered all types of crops e g rice wheat and cotton excluding vegetables moreover cao et al 2020 obtained the irrigation water requirement based on crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation which was deduced from several factors e g planting period temperature and wind speed but they failed to reveal the actual irrigation consumption song and chen 2019 calculated the water footprint of the production of grains including rice wheat and maize during 1997 2015 irrigation use which was higher than the actual irrigation consumption was adopted by song and chen 2019 in the present study the irrigation consumption of the overall crop production was considered and derived from national water resource bulletins which are comprehensive and authoritative 3 2 exploration of key factors 3 2 1 identification of key factors fig 2a illustrates the contribution of key substances to midpoint categories and traces the sources of these substances specifically water scarcity irrigation water derived from direct consumption dominated the influences of water scarcity 99 10 carcinogens cr vi emitted to water mainly caused by diesel and fertilizer production was the most significant contributor to the carcinogens category followed by cr emitted to air and soil non carcinogens as emitted to air hg emitted to air and ti emitted to soil accounted for 77 66 10 78 and 6 88 of the non carcinogens impacts respectively almost all these three pollutants were derived from diesel and fertilizer production freshwater ecotoxicity fe emitted to soil and cu contributed mostly to the freshwater ecotoxicity category while sr and al emitted to water played influencing roles in this category these four metal emissions were mainly ascribed to fertilizer and diesel production processes aquatic eutrophication the impact of this category was mainly contributed by tp and cod emissions caused by fertilizer loss during crop production acidification so2 emission resulting from fertilizer production electricity generation and diesel production was the dominant contributor to this category nh3 n emission from direct emission process contributed slightly to this category the contribution of key substances and processes to the following endpoint categories is exhibited in fig 2b human health irrigation water from direct consumption contributed 45 80 to the total influence cr vi emitted to water and as emitted to air which were mainly derived from fertilizer and diesel production processes played an additional effective role in the human health category ecosystem quality given that freshwater ecotoxicity contributed approximately 92 to ecosystem quality the key substances and processes of freshwater ecotoxicity were similar to those of ecosystem quality irrigation water and so2 exerted additional influences on the ecosystem quality category 3 2 2 sensitivity analysis to estimate the effects of inputs on the water footprint analysis results 5 variation in the dominant processes influencing analysis categories was applied fig 3 the sensitivity analysis results showed that a 5 decrease in diesel consumption was accompanied by 1 85 and 2 44 reductions in human health and ecosystem quality respectively a similar deduction for the remaining processes and categories could be obtained in fig 3 direct consumption was the most sensitive to water scarcity and human health and direct emissions presented the highest contribution to aquatic eutrophication the dramatic decrease in diesel production demonstrated the highest alteration in the remaining categories except for acidification in which the sensitivity of fertilizer production was higher than that of diesel production these findings indicated that improving the utilization efficiency of irrigation water and reducing the diesel and fertilizer consumption should be prioritized for controlling environmental burdens 3 2 3 policy implementation excessive irrigation is the common practice in china which leads to the low use efficiency of water much effort such as sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation under film mulch and infiltrating irrigation has been made to improve irrigation efficiency with the popularization of these technologies the irrigation efficiency has kept increasing in recent years table a 5 and exceeded the targeted value of 0 55 ahead of schedule mwr 2010 however this efficiency remains considerably behind the world advanced level of 0 7 0 8 fang et al 2017 among the five regions the southwestern area has the lowest irrigation efficiency table a 6 which is mainly due to the complex terrain and lower economical level in this region feng 2013 the high proportion of large scale irrigation districts in this region e g sichuan province also contributes to low irrigation efficiency mwr 2018 li et al 2020 to achieve the goal of reaching 0 6 for irrigation efficiency by 2030 mwr 2010 western areas should be considered the main targets in the future nonetheless several scholars have indicated that increasing irrigation efficiency might fail to reduce irrigation water known as rebound gomez and perez blanco 2014 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 wang et al 2020 the development of water saving irrigation technologies will lead to decreased water consumption with the same output and drive farmers to expand agricultural land areas to pursue increased economic income to solve the aforementioned problem water quotas have been proven to restraint the rebound effect of irrigation water to a certain extent song et al 2018 with the promulgation of the first national irrigation quota on wheat in 2020 mwr 2020 the government will continue to publish a series of irrigation quotas on main crops which will greatly promote the water saving in crop production thus water saving irrigation technologies and water quotas should be simultaneously considered the impetuses of sustainable agricultural development fertilizer use contributes significantly to the environmental burdens during crop production as supported by zhang et al 2018 wang 2016 scientific nutrient management measures including soil testing for formulated fertilization straw returning to field and integrated water and fertilizer have been recommended by the chinese government to achieve zero growth in fertilizer use moa 2015a previous research has estimated the total nutrient resources in china s straw yield namely 6 11 2 00 and 11 41 mton of n p2o5 and k2o respectively yin et al 2018 straw returning to filed could lead to reductions of 23 14 and 92 in nitrogen phosphate and potash fertilizer consumption respectively during crop production thus the potential impacts on human health and ecosystem quality could be decreased by 1 65 and 5 07 respectively compared with the no straw returning to field scenario existing policies pay considerable attention to the innovation of fertilization technologies while large scale farms can also be effective in decreasing fertilizer consumption compared with smallholder farms ju et al 2016 wang et al 2019b farmers with small plots tend to consume substantial labor and fertilizer due to the lack of advanced fertilization machines and professional management although crop production is still dominated by smallholder farms in china rapid urbanization forces farmers to move to urban areas and transform their farmland to a collective farm large scale farms undoubtedly will become a main management form of crop production in china in near future with its advantages of increased yield and decreased economic cost therefore further attention should be paid to strengthening fertilization management and increasing farm size the tremendous contribution of diesel to environmental burdens is due to the heavy metal emissions during its production stage which indicates the necessity for energy saving agricultural machinery development most farmers in china have limited education which results in shortsighted economic behavior wang et al 2019a they prefer to purchase affordable agricultural machinery and fail to consider the energy consumption during its operation stage the subsidy policy supported by the government can stimulate the elimination of obsolete machinery and the application of advanced equipment moa 2016 high performance and energy saving machinery is financially favorable for farmers because its purchase is subsidized by the government although small sized machinery with the problems of low efficiency and excessive emissions predominates the agricultural machinery in china large scale agricultural production can provide basic conditions for the effective operation of agricultural machinery which can significantly reduce the operating cost of agricultural machinery and increase economic efficiency wang et al 2017 meanwhile biodiesel has received great attention due to the strength of reducing fossil resource consumption and environmental pollution mahmudul et al 2017 assuming biodiesel use to replace diesel in this study the potential impacts on human health and ecosystem quality during crop production will correspondingly reduce by 36 61 and 48 22 respectively xu et al 2016 indicated that regarding biodiesel as an alternative to diesel in crop production can be totally realized because of the minimal requirement on oil quality in consideration of the low self sufficiency rate of edible vegetable oils and the high output of waste cooking oil waste cooking oil is currently the main feedstock for biodiesel production in china which prevents the conflict between food and energy bai et al 2021b xu et al 2016 however the quality of biodiesel based on waste cooking oils varies and is influenced by the complex and inconsistent components of the raw material li et al 2011 and an unqualified product will influence the engine life sun et al 2019 owing to the merits of high oil content and minimal growing area demand shah et al 2018 microalgae could be regarded as an attractive feedstock for china s biodiesel development high production costs and the lack of technologies are two main challenges in microalgal biodiesel production in china thus the government should provide incentive policies to facilitate the development of china s microalgal biodiesel industry 3 3 analysis of temporal variation and driving factors the temporal trends of human health and ecosystem quality impacts from 2008 to 2017 are shown in fig 4 the variation in ecosystem quality was similar to that in human health which could be divided into two stages the environmental burdens gradually increased during 2008 2015 and decreased in 2016 which indicated that 2016 was the turning point to reverse the growing trend the results kept relatively stable with a slight change after 2016 these analyses implied that environmental burdens caused by crop production have been alleviated in recent years which was mainly due to the nationwide campaign initiated by the chinese government to promote agricultural modernization e g limitation in fertilizer consumption vigorously in the 13th five year plan state council 2016 agricultural economic scale was identified as the largest positive driving factor by further assessing the driving factors behind the temporal variation which is consistent with other studies li et al 2014a 2014b zhao and chen 2014 the development of agricultural economy relies heavily on material and energy inputs in production process which leads to environmental deterioration han et al 2018 given that agriculture is the basic industry of national economy maintaining the steady development of agriculture and increasing farmers income will still be the basic state policies in china undoubtedly the agricultural economy will continue to grow which will increase the environmental burdens in agricultural production in the short term the agricultural structure effect on environmental burdens was unstable but its cumulative contribution was positive the changes in agricultural structure promoted the increase in environmental impacts in most time intervals except 2010 2011 and 2015 2016 agriculture as a percentage of primary industry increased from 48 in 2008 to 53 in 2017 nbs 2009 2018 the change in the agricultural structure effect is consistent with that in agricultural proportion which indicated that optimization of agricultural structure will restraint the increase in environmental burden crop productivity was the primary driving factor for reducing environmental impacts which is in line with the results of previous studies tian et al 2014 han et al 2018 the cumulative reductions in human health and ecosystem quality due to crop productivity were 8 19 104 daly and 9 60 103 species year during 2008 2017 respectively which accounted for more than 70 of the total reduction thus increasing crop productivity by wide application of advanced and clean agricultural technology can dramatically facilitate burden reduction the effect of population scale on the reduction in environmental impacts was positive and relatively limited the agricultural population of china decreased from 72 1 million in 2008 to 57 7 million in 2017 which exerted a positive effect on the development of agricultural mechanization and further increased production efficiency 3 4 spatial heterogeneity of agricultural water footprint at the city level the spatial distribution of human health and ecosystem quality impacts caused by crop production in china was uneven and presented significant variations fig 5a to assess the spatial autocorrelation of environmental impacts global moran s i was first calculated from the overall perspective the values for human health and ecosystem quality impacts were 0 15 and 0 17 p 0 0001 respectively which indicated significant positive spatial autocorrelations in environmental burdens then local moran s i was adopted to perform clustering and outlier analysis to explore the spatial characteristics of environmental burdens at the city level fig 5b high high clusters were mainly distributed in the north china plain including hebei shandong henan jiangsu shanxi and anhui plain topography favorable climate condition and superior soil quality make the north china plain one of the premium agricultural regions in china li et al 2014a 2014b a similar cluster phenomenon can be observed in the yangtze river delta which is a developed and populated region in china the booming development of crop production is attributed to the massive demand for agricultural products from urban population in this region in addition to the advantage of plain terrain sun et al 2017 meanwhile the plain dominates the terrain in the eastern inner mongolia which provides a superior condition for agricultural development the xingan league coupled with its neighboring regions i e hulunbeir and tongliao located in the eastern inner mongolia contributed approximately 40 and 58 to the agricultural output value and grain output of the province in 2017 respectively this condition explained the formation of a high high cluster in the xingan league imbs 2018 another high high cluster related to human health impact was observed in xinjiang province including the hotan area and ili kazakh autonomous prefecture abundant sunshine duration and heat coupled with a large temperature difference between day and night lead to xinjiang province being one of the major agricultural production regions in china especially in cotton production zhang et al 2020 however massive irrigation water is required to satisfy the water requirement for crop growth due to dry climate and the lowest precipitation during the crop growing season wang et al 2018 high irrigation consumption was responsible for the high human health impact in this region surrounded by these high high agglomeration areas cities classified as low high concentrations such as zhangjiakou and zaozhuang were identified these cities have less favorable natural endowments and lower agricultural output values compared with the surrounding cities which result in being low value areas hbbs 2018 sdbs 2018 conversely cities have high environmental burdens and neighboring cities have relatively low burdens that are characterized by a high low cluster such as zhanjiang and nanning these cities have a relatively high agricultural development level with the agricultural output values accounting for approximately 15 of the provincial values gdbs 2018 gxbs 2018 among the four cluster categories low low clusters accounted for the largest contributions of significantly correlated cities with 42 41 and 46 24 for human health and ecosystem quality respectively the low low clusters were relatively concentrated which were mainly located in qinghai sichuan gansu guizhou and hainan except for the areas above low low agglomeration levels in ecosystem quality were also distributed in guangdong guangxi hunan and jiangxi restricted by mountainous and hilly terrain and drought disasters these regions are unfit for developing large scale crop production zeng et al 2019 han et al 2016 these analyses indicated the spatial characteristic of environmental burdens at the city level thus different areas should implement distinct policies for alleviating potential environmental impacts considering that the high high cluster cities are the major crop production areas the curtailment of environmental impacts cannot be achieved by cutting the production scale in these regions meanwhile the majority of high high cluster cities are classified as optimized development areas in the sustainable agricultural development plan moa 2015b these regions should promote the application of environment friendly producing technologies and enhance their radiation capability for the regions in the low agricultural development level not only the potential of suitable agricultural products should be tapped on the basis of regional resource endowments and agricultural comparative advantages but attention should also be focused on potential environmental impacts furthermore strengthening interregional communication encouraging cross region cooperation and jointly promoting sustainable agricultural development in areas with similar endowment resources through clustering effects are necessary urbanization level gdp per capita precipitation cultivated area effective irrigation area proportion fertilizer use intensity and diesel use intensity were selected to explore the underlying factors driving the spatial heterogeneity of water footprint analysis results in this study table a 6 as shown in table a 7 the impact of socioeconomic factors i e urbanization level and gdp per capita on environmental burdens was insignificant at the city level precipitation and cultivated area were the reflections of regional water and land resource endowment which were negatively and positively correlated with environmental impacts at the 1 level respectively abundant precipitation could reduce the irrigation consumption and the environmental impacts related to water consumption conversely the increase in cultivated area promoted the agricultural development while also increasing the risks of environmental impacts the effective irrigation area proportion was significantly correlated with the human health impact whereas the contribution of reducing irrigation water to the reduction in ecosystem quality impact was insignificant this discrepancy was mainly due to that the contribution of irrigation water to the human health impact was higher than that to the ecosystem quality impact fig 2 the expansion of effective irrigation area is conductive to increasing crop yields and means enhanced potential environmental impacts cao et al 2020 the fertilizer use intensity exhibited a negative correlation with the environmental impacts on human health and ecosystem quality with correlation coefficients of 0 216 and 0 221 at the significance level of 1 respectively a similar relationship was observed in the environmental impacts with diesel use intensity these results indicated that the environmental damage originated from crop production is rising with the increase in agricultural input intensity i e fertilizer and diesel consistent with the analysis of key factors improving the utilization efficiency of fertilizer and diesel is necessary to abate environmental impacts 4 conclusions this study focused on identifying the key factors exploring the spatiotemporal variation and providing recommendations for crop production in china from the perspective of water footprint direct consumption fertilizer production and diesel production were the key factors that exerted substantial environmental impacts the lmdi approach was adopted to explore the driving factors behind the temporal variations in water footprint analysis results which increased during 2008 2015 and decreased in 2016 agricultural economic scale drove mostly the increase in environmental impacts whereas crop productivity exhibited a conflicting contribution in consideration of the impossibility of restraining agricultural economic growth increasing crop productivity was a superior option to facilitate burden reduction local moran s i values implied that high high agglomerations were mainly concentrated in the north china plain and yangtze river delta which could be attributed to their superior natural resource endowment and large demand for agricultural products advanced agricultural technology should be vigorously prompted in these areas to enhance their radiation capability and drive the overall sustainable agricultural development the correlation analysis demonstrated that the spatial variation in environmental impacts was positively affected by cultivated land fertilizer intensity diesel intensity and effective irrigation area proportion whereas precipitation correlated negatively with environmental burdens overall promoting water saving agricultural practices and improving the efficiency of fertilizer and diesel use are highly recommended to ameliorate the environmental performance the conclusions generated from this study can provide theoretical evidence for decision makers to implement targeted agricultural management policies in this study we merely conducted a correlation analysis without considering spatial spillover effects further investigation on the regional differences in the influencing factors of environmental impacts will be conducted in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9928,global water resources are under tremendous pressure influenced by population growth and economic development considering that the agricultural sector accounts for the largest consumption and that china is one of the major agricultural countries this study conducted an impact oriented water footprint analysis to quantify the environmental burdens of crop production in china from a life cycle perspective the temporal variation of potential environmental impacts during 2008 2017 was evaluated and 334 cities in china were used to investigate the spatial characteristics of environmental burdens results showed that the environmental burdens were mainly ascribed to direct consumption fertilizer production and diesel production the overall burdens uninterruptedly increased from 2008 to 2015 and then declined in 2016 the decomposition results of temporal variation demonstrated that agricultural economic scale and crop productivity were the largest positive and negative contributors to burden growth respectively the burdens exhibited an evident spatial autocorrelation and high high agglomerations were mostly located in the north china plain and yangtze river delta due to the superior natural resource endowments and dense population in these regions such factors as natural resource endowments i e cultivated land and precipitation agricultural input intensity i e fertilizer and diesel and effective irrigation area proportion significantly influenced the spatial variation of environmental impacts at the city level therefore adopting water saving technologies strengthening fertilization management promoting large scale and mechanized agriculture and choosing clean alternative fuels are highly recommended to achieve sustainable agricultural development furthermore in consideration of the dominance of high high clusters in crop production in china advanced and eco friendly production technologies should be vigorously incentivized in these regions to enhance their agglomeration and radiation force keywords water footprint crop production china city level life cycle assessment 1 introduction global water demand driven by population growth socioeconomic development and changing consumption patterns is projected to increase by 55 between 2000 and 2050 unesco 2020 water scarcity one of the global risks of highest concern will continue to aggravate with the rising water demand and changing climate hoekstra 2014 the agricultural sector is the largest consumer of water resources and contributes to approximately two thirds of the global freshwater withdrawal fao 2014 finogenova et al 2019 agricultural water demand is predicted to grow rapidly under the situation without policy interventions pastor et al 2019 therefore the agricultural sector has a decisive influence on coping with the water scarcity crisis as one of the major agricultural countries in the world china currently faces severe water pressure due to its rapid development and urbanization the agricultural sector accounts for approximately 60 of total water use in china mwr 2019 and 85 of total agricultural water use is ascribed to water for crops yu et al 2021 the leaching of fertilizers and pesticides in crop production further aggravates the water scarcity in china zhang et al 2018 hence identifying the current situation e g environmental impacts and key factors of water consumption and pollution during crop production is highly necessary to address the water scarcity issue and facilitate sustainable agricultural development in china water footprint originally proposed by hoekstra hoekstra 2003 is used to assess the impacts of human activities on freshwater appropriation volumetric and impact oriented methods are the two methods widely used in water footprint analysis berger and finkbeiner 2013 borsato et al 2019 jefferies et al 2012 the volumetric method aims to support enhanced water management and allocation hoekstra 2016 the impact oriented method which is developed by the life cycle assessment community and formalized in the iso standard bayart et al 2010 iso 6 1404 2014 mainly focuses on assessing the potential environmental impacts associated with water availability and degradation from a life cycle perspective most previous studies have adopted the volumetric method to quantify the water footprint of crop production at the inventory level zhao and chen 2014 cao et al 2020 xu et al 2015 or assessed the environmental performance of specific crops via the impact oriented method zhai et al 2019b bai et al 2021a huang et al 2014 however in depth analysis of the overall crop production via the impact oriented method to perform comparative analysis and explore key factors is scarce to reveal the key factors behind the changes in water footprint analysis results over time methods that identify the driving forces of temporal changes should be employed the logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi decomposition method introduced by ang 2004 can be employed to decompose the impacts without residuals this method was initially and extensively applied to analyze the driving factors of energy consumption and co2 emissions chong et al 2019 gu et al 2019 although recent studies have proved its applicability in volumetric water footprint analysis zhao and chen 2014 xu et al 2015 no studies have explored the changes in impact oriented water footprint analysis via the lmdi method previous works have assessed the water footprint of crop production in china primarily at the national zhao and chen 2014 or provincial level cao et al 2020 song et al 2019 but a more accurate and targeted implementation of agricultural management requires the evaluation of the water footprint at a more detailed scale e g river basin or city level zeng et al 2012 quantified the water footprint within heihe river basin china and indicated that crop production accounted for 92 of the total water footprint wang et al 2019b assessed the water pollution during crop production in chizhou city china but only considered the impacts of nitrogen fertilizer leaching xu et al 2015 assessed the water footprint of six typical crops in beijing china ma et al 2020 explored the spatiotemporal characteristics of water footprint requirement in zhangjiakou china china is a vast country with considerable topographical and economic diversity among cities consequently the potential environmental burdens of crop production in each city are different zhou et al 2018 a wide city level water footprint analysis is conducive to exploring the spatial characteristics of the burdens and implementing differentiated and targeted mitigation measures therefore this study performs an impact oriented water footprint analysis of crop production in china to provide a holistic picture of the impacts associated with water i e water consumption and pollution china s regional water resources environment and geographic conditions are considered in the water footprint analysis method in this study to quantify the environmental performance at the macro level and demonstrate the spatial variations from a city level perspective key factors contributing to water related environmental impacts are identified from a methodological point of view lmdi and spatial autocorrelation analysis are used to identify the driving factors and determine hotspots respectively this study provides valuable insights into agricultural management from an environmental perspective at the macro level and a reference for formulating targeted policies for local governments 2 methodology 2 1 system boundary and functional unit the system boundary was established via a cradle to gate approach in this study as shown in fig 1 raw material production energy generation transport and pollutants discharged from crop production process were considered whereas straw treatment process was not involved due to small contribution and unavailable data zhai et al 2019a annual crop production was selected as the functional unit to provide the counting base for the inventory and analysis results 2 2 analysis methods 2 2 1 water footprint analysis water footprint analysis was conducted at midpoint and endpoint levels to evaluate the potential impacts related to water availability and degradation in crop production the regional situation in china was considered in the calculation of the characterization factors of midpoint categories the water scarcity category was adopted for water availability analysis and its impact was calculated following our previous research zhai et al 2021a 2021b 1 i w s w f w w w v w e r w f w d i w i n 1 r w d i w d where i ws w in and w d are the water scarcity impact indirect water consumption and direct water consumption respectively w f w w w v and w e refer to freshwater withdrawals wastewater discharges synthetically created vapor and evaporation respectively which are all based on the information of chinese regional water resources r represents the internal evaporation recycling and wdi means water deprivation index the remaining five categories were used to assess the potential impacts caused by water degradation and their characterization factors were obtained from the research of ma et al 2019 who integrated china s environmental and geographic situations into calculations in terms of endpoint two endpoint categories i e human health and ecosystem quality were selected as the two areas of protection table a 1 and deduced by using midpoint categories through the relationships presented by the recipe 2016 model huijbregts et al 2017 the aforementioned water footprint analysis was implemented via the simapro 8 4 software sensitivity analysis was also conducted in this study to analyze the influence degree of input variables on output results 2 s i δ o u t p u t i δ i n p u t i δ o o δ i i where s i is the sensitivity of the variation of output output i to the variation of input parameter input i o and i represent the relative change in the output and input respectively and o and i are the initial output and input respectively 2 2 2 lmdi analysis lmdi method is an index decomposition analysis method based on the divisia index and can decompose several factors without zero residual errors ang 2004 this method was employed in this study to explore the driving factors behind the temporal changes in water footprint analysis results w it was first decomposed as follows eq 3 3 w w f a a g d p a g d p t g d p t g d p p p d s e p where agdp tgdp and p are the agricultural output value the output value of primary industries i e agriculture forestry animal husbandry and fishery and agricultural population respectively and d s and e represent the crop productivity agricultural structure and agricultural economic scale respectively the additive decomposition approach was then adopted to analyze the overall change in the results w eq 4 4 δ w w t w 0 δ d δ s δ e δ p where w t and w 0 are the results in t and base periods respectively the effects of four driving factors were estimated using the equations below eq 5 5 δ d w t w 0 ln w t ln w 0 ln d t d t δ s w t w 0 ln w t ln w 0 ln s t s 0 δ e w t w 0 ln w t ln w 0 ln e t e 0 δ p w t w 0 ln w t ln w 0 ln p t p 0 on the basis of the formulas above and the water footprint analysis results in the study period the contributions of each driving factor to the time series change in the potential impacts of crop production in china were quantified 2 2 3 spatial autocorrelation analysis global and local moran s i were adopted to investigate the spatial characteristics of the water footprint analysis results at the city level global moran s i is the global indicator for the spatial autocorrelation and ranges from 1 1 a value 0 implies a positive spatial correlation whereas a value 0 implies a negative spatial correlation if the value nears 1 it indicates great spatial clustering inversely a great dispersion situation is presented the formula for calculating global moran s i is shown as follows eq 6 6 m o r a n s i m 1 k n 1 k w m n x m x x n x 1 k m 1 k x m x m 1 k n 1 k w m n x 1 k m 1 k x m where x m and x n refer to the water footprint analysis results of cities m and n respectively k represents the number of cities and w mn is the spatial weight matrix local moran s i was used in this study to examine the distribution pattern of the water footprint analysis results for individual city considering that global moran s i only reflects the differences in spatial average results the formula of local moran s i is expressed as follows 7 m o r a n s i x m x 1 k m 1 k x m x m n k w m n x n x the parameters in eq 7 have the same meanings as those in eq 6 a positive local moran s i value means that the areas are surrounded by similar high or low value areas expressed as high high or low low clusters conversely a negative value implies that high value areas are surrounded by low value areas marked as high low outliers or the areas with low values are surrounded by high value areas i e low high outliers the spatial analysis above was achieved via arcgis and geoda software 2 3 inventory and data sources the national data of irrigation consumption were collected from china water resources bulletins of 2008 2017 mwr 2008 2017 while other agricultural material inputs i e fertilizer pesticide film diesel and electricity were acquired from nbs 2009 2018 the emission coefficients of fertilizer were adopted from the national census of pollutant sources cfpc 2009 the national water footprint inventory of crop production in 2017 is shown in table a 2 based on the defined system boundary and functional unit the national output value and population data for the lmdi analysis were obtained from the national statistical yearbook nbs 2009 2018 given the data availability data of 334 cities were applied in this study to explore the spatial heterogeneity and city level data e g material inputs urbanization precipitation and cultivated land were collected from provincial water resource bulletins table a 3 and statistical bureaus table a 4 chinese regional database cplcid 2020 provided the background data of crop production such as fertilizer production diesel production and transportation 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantification of water footprint analysis results table 1 displays the water footprint analysis results of crop production in china in 2017 with squared geometric standard deviation gsd2 which were used to obtain the variation interval of the results the scope of potential impacts for categories ranged from the division to multiplication of medium and gsd2 values for midpoint categories the medium value and gsd2 of the water scarcity category were 9 74 1010 m3 deprived and 1 30 respectively this result indicated that the fluctuation range of this category was 7 49 1010 1 27 1011 m3 deprived 95 confidence interval similar deductions could be conducted for the remaining categories the medium values were 3 45 103 cases 1 47 103 8 11 103 cases on carcinogens 1 28 104 cases 3 78 103 4 34 104 cases on non

109 kg so2 eq on acidification in terms of endpoint categories the value of human health was 1 38 105 daly with gsd2 of 1 73 therefore the potential impact on human health varied from 7 98 104 daly to 2 39 105 daly likewise the potential impact on ecosystem quality was 1 82 104 species yr varying from 9 43 103 species yr to 3 51 104 species yr gsd2 1 93 the value of irrigation in this study was lower than reported values table 2 these divergent values could be attributed to the different calculation methods and scopes the irrigation consumption accounting in the research of cao et al 2020 was based on a bottom up approach the authors considered all types of crops e g rice wheat and cotton excluding vegetables moreover cao et al 2020 obtained the irrigation water requirement based on crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation which was deduced from several factors e g planting period temperature and wind speed but they failed to reveal the actual irrigation consumption song and chen 2019 calculated the water footprint of the production of grains including rice wheat and maize during 1997 2015 irrigation use which was higher than the actual irrigation consumption was adopted by song and chen 2019 in the present study the irrigation consumption of the overall crop production was considered and derived from national water resource bulletins which are comprehensive and authoritative 3 2 exploration of key factors 3 2 1 identification of key factors fig 2a illustrates the contribution of key substances to midpoint categories and traces the sources of these substances specifically water scarcity irrigation water derived from direct consumption dominated the influences of water scarcity 99 10 carcinogens cr vi emitted to water mainly caused by diesel and fertilizer production was the most significant contributor to the carcinogens category followed by cr emitted to air and soil non carcinogens as emitted to air hg emitted to air and ti emitted to soil accounted for 77 66 10 78 and 6 88 of the non carcinogens impacts respectively almost all these three pollutants were derived from diesel and fertilizer production freshwater ecotoxicity fe emitted to soil and cu contributed mostly to the freshwater ecotoxicity category while sr and al emitted to water played influencing roles in this category these four metal emissions were mainly ascribed to fertilizer and diesel production processes aquatic eutrophication the impact of this category was mainly contributed by tp and cod emissions caused by fertilizer loss during crop production acidification so2 emission resulting from fertilizer production electricity generation and diesel production was the dominant contributor to this category nh3 n emission from direct emission process contributed slightly to this category the contribution of key substances and processes to the following endpoint categories is exhibited in fig 2b human health irrigation water from direct consumption contributed 45 80 to the total influence cr vi emitted to water and as emitted to air which were mainly derived from fertilizer and diesel production processes played an additional effective role in the human health category ecosystem quality given that freshwater ecotoxicity contributed approximately 92 to ecosystem quality the key substances and processes of freshwater ecotoxicity were similar to those of ecosystem quality irrigation water and so2 exerted additional influences on the ecosystem quality category 3 2 2 sensitivity analysis to estimate the effects of inputs on the water footprint analysis results 5 variation in the dominant processes influencing analysis categories was applied fig 3 the sensitivity analysis results showed that a 5 decrease in diesel consumption was accompanied by 1 85 and 2 44 reductions in human health and ecosystem quality respectively a similar deduction for the remaining processes and categories could be obtained in fig 3 direct consumption was the most sensitive to water scarcity and human health and direct emissions presented the highest contribution to aquatic eutrophication the dramatic decrease in diesel production demonstrated the highest alteration in the remaining categories except for acidification in which the sensitivity of fertilizer production was higher than that of diesel production these findings indicated that improving the utilization efficiency of irrigation water and reducing the diesel and fertilizer consumption should be prioritized for controlling environmental burdens 3 2 3 policy implementation excessive irrigation is the common practice in china which leads to the low use efficiency of water much effort such as sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation under film mulch and infiltrating irrigation has been made to improve irrigation efficiency with the popularization of these technologies the irrigation efficiency has kept increasing in recent years table a 5 and exceeded the targeted value of 0 55 ahead of schedule mwr 2010 however this efficiency remains considerably behind the world advanced level of 0 7 0 8 fang et al 2017 among the five regions the southwestern area has the lowest irrigation efficiency table a 6 which is mainly due to the complex terrain and lower economical level in this region feng 2013 the high proportion of large scale irrigation districts in this region e g sichuan province also contributes to low irrigation efficiency mwr 2018 li et al 2020 to achieve the goal of reaching 0 6 for irrigation efficiency by 2030 mwr 2010 western areas should be considered the main targets in the future nonetheless several scholars have indicated that increasing irrigation efficiency might fail to reduce irrigation water known as rebound gomez and perez blanco 2014 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 wang et al 2020 the development of water saving irrigation technologies will lead to decreased water consumption with the same output and drive farmers to expand agricultural land areas to pursue increased economic income to solve the aforementioned problem water quotas have been proven to restraint the rebound effect of irrigation water to a certain extent song et al 2018 with the promulgation of the first national irrigation quota on wheat in 2020 mwr 2020 the government will continue to publish a series of irrigation quotas on main crops which will greatly promote the water saving in crop production thus water saving irrigation technologies and water quotas should be simultaneously considered the impetuses of sustainable agricultural development fertilizer use contributes significantly to the environmental burdens during crop production as supported by zhang et al 2018 wang 2016 scientific nutrient management measures including soil testing for formulated fertilization straw returning to field and integrated water and fertilizer have been recommended by the chinese government to achieve zero growth in fertilizer use moa 2015a previous research has estimated the total nutrient resources in china s straw yield namely 6 11 2 00 and 11 41 mton of n p2o5 and k2o respectively yin et al 2018 straw returning to filed could lead to reductions of 23 14 and 92 in nitrogen phosphate and potash fertilizer consumption respectively during crop production thus the potential impacts on human health and ecosystem quality could be decreased by 1 65 and 5 07 respectively compared with the no straw returning to field scenario existing policies pay considerable attention to the innovation of fertilization technologies while large scale farms can also be effective in decreasing fertilizer consumption compared with smallholder farms ju et al 2016 wang et al 2019b farmers with small plots tend to consume substantial labor and fertilizer due to the lack of advanced fertilization machines and professional management although crop production is still dominated by smallholder farms in china rapid urbanization forces farmers to move to urban areas and transform their farmland to a collective farm large scale farms undoubtedly will become a main management form of crop production in china in near future with its advantages of increased yield and decreased economic cost therefore further attention should be paid to strengthening fertilization management and increasing farm size the tremendous contribution of diesel to environmental burdens is due to the heavy metal emissions during its production stage which indicates the necessity for energy saving agricultural machinery development most farmers in china have limited education which results in shortsighted economic behavior wang et al 2019a they prefer to purchase affordable agricultural machinery and fail to consider the energy consumption during its operation stage the subsidy policy supported by the government can stimulate the elimination of obsolete machinery and the application of advanced equipment moa 2016 high performance and energy saving machinery is financially favorable for farmers because its purchase is subsidized by the government although small sized machinery with the problems of low efficiency and excessive emissions predominates the agricultural machinery in china large scale agricultural production can provide basic conditions for the effective operation of agricultural machinery which can significantly reduce the operating cost of agricultural machinery and increase economic efficiency wang et al 2017 meanwhile biodiesel has received great attention due to the strength of reducing fossil resource consumption and environmental pollution mahmudul et al 2017 assuming biodiesel use to replace diesel in this study the potential impacts on human health and ecosystem quality during crop production will correspondingly reduce by 36 61 and 48 22 respectively xu et al 2016 indicated that regarding biodiesel as an alternative to diesel in crop production can be totally realized because of the minimal requirement on oil quality in consideration of the low self sufficiency rate of edible vegetable oils and the high output of waste cooking oil waste cooking oil is currently the main feedstock for biodiesel production in china which prevents the conflict between food and energy bai et al 2021b xu et al 2016 however the quality of biodiesel based on waste cooking oils varies and is influenced by the complex and inconsistent components of the raw material li et al 2011 and an unqualified product will influence the engine life sun et al 2019 owing to the merits of high oil content and minimal growing area demand shah et al 2018 microalgae could be regarded as an attractive feedstock for china s biodiesel development high production costs and the lack of technologies are two main challenges in microalgal biodiesel production in china thus the government should provide incentive policies to facilitate the development of china s microalgal biodiesel industry 3 3 analysis of temporal variation and driving factors the temporal trends of human health and ecosystem quality impacts from 2008 to 2017 are shown in fig 4 the variation in ecosystem quality was similar to that in human health which could be divided into two stages the environmental burdens gradually increased during 2008 2015 and decreased in 2016 which indicated that 2016 was the turning point to reverse the growing trend the results kept relatively stable with a slight change after 2016 these analyses implied that environmental burdens caused by crop production have been alleviated in recent years which was mainly due to the nationwide campaign initiated by the chinese government to promote agricultural modernization e g limitation in fertilizer consumption vigorously in the 13th five year plan state council 2016 agricultural economic scale was identified as the largest positive driving factor by further assessing the driving factors behind the temporal variation which is consistent with other studies li et al 2014a 2014b zhao and chen 2014 the development of agricultural economy relies heavily on material and energy inputs in production process which leads to environmental deterioration han et al 2018 given that agriculture is the basic industry of national economy maintaining the steady development of agriculture and increasing farmers income will still be the basic state policies in china undoubtedly the agricultural economy will continue to grow which will increase the environmental burdens in agricultural production in the short term the agricultural structure effect on environmental burdens was unstable but its cumulative contribution was positive the changes in agricultural structure promoted the increase in environmental impacts in most time intervals except 2010 2011 and 2015 2016 agriculture as a percentage of primary industry increased from 48 in 2008 to 53 in 2017 nbs 2009 2018 the change in the agricultural structure effect is consistent with that in agricultural proportion which indicated that optimization of agricultural structure will restraint the increase in environmental burden crop productivity was the primary driving factor for reducing environmental impacts which is in line with the results of previous studies tian et al 2014 han et al 2018 the cumulative reductions in human health and ecosystem quality due to crop productivity were 8 19 104 daly and 9 60 103 species year during 2008 2017 respectively which accounted for more than 70 of the total reduction thus increasing crop productivity by wide application of advanced and clean agricultural technology can dramatically facilitate burden reduction the effect of population scale on the reduction in environmental impacts was positive and relatively limited the agricultural population of china decreased from 72 1 million in 2008 to 57 7 million in 2017 which exerted a positive effect on the development of agricultural mechanization and further increased production efficiency 3 4 spatial heterogeneity of agricultural water footprint at the city level the spatial distribution of human health and ecosystem quality impacts caused by crop production in china was uneven and presented significant variations fig 5a to assess the spatial autocorrelation of environmental impacts global moran s i was first calculated from the overall perspective the values for human health and ecosystem quality impacts were 0 15 and 0 17 p 0 0001 respectively which indicated significant positive spatial autocorrelations in environmental burdens then local moran s i was adopted to perform clustering and outlier analysis to explore the spatial characteristics of environmental burdens at the city level fig 5b high high clusters were mainly distributed in the north china plain including hebei shandong henan jiangsu shanxi and anhui plain topography favorable climate condition and superior soil quality make the north china plain one of the premium agricultural regions in china li et al 2014a 2014b a similar cluster phenomenon can be observed in the yangtze river delta which is a developed and populated region in china the booming development of crop production is attributed to the massive demand for agricultural products from urban population in this region in addition to the advantage of plain terrain sun et al 2017 meanwhile the plain dominates the terrain in the eastern inner mongolia which provides a superior condition for agricultural development the xingan league coupled with its neighboring regions i e hulunbeir and tongliao located in the eastern inner mongolia contributed approximately 40 and 58 to the agricultural output value and grain output of the province in 2017 respectively this condition explained the formation of a high high cluster in the xingan league imbs 2018 another high high cluster related to human health impact was observed in xinjiang province including the hotan area and ili kazakh autonomous prefecture abundant sunshine duration and heat coupled with a large temperature difference between day and night lead to xinjiang province being one of the major agricultural production regions in china especially in cotton production zhang et al 2020 however massive irrigation water is required to satisfy the water requirement for crop growth due to dry climate and the lowest precipitation during the crop growing season wang et al 2018 high irrigation consumption was responsible for the high human health impact in this region surrounded by these high high agglomeration areas cities classified as low high concentrations such as zhangjiakou and zaozhuang were identified these cities have less favorable natural endowments and lower agricultural output values compared with the surrounding cities which result in being low value areas hbbs 2018 sdbs 2018 conversely cities have high environmental burdens and neighboring cities have relatively low burdens that are characterized by a high low cluster such as zhanjiang and nanning these cities have a relatively high agricultural development level with the agricultural output values accounting for approximately 15 of the provincial values gdbs 2018 gxbs 2018 among the four cluster categories low low clusters accounted for the largest contributions of significantly correlated cities with 42 41 and 46 24 for human health and ecosystem quality respectively the low low clusters were relatively concentrated which were mainly located in qinghai sichuan gansu guizhou and hainan except for the areas above low low agglomeration levels in ecosystem quality were also distributed in guangdong guangxi hunan and jiangxi restricted by mountainous and hilly terrain and drought disasters these regions are unfit for developing large scale crop production zeng et al 2019 han et al 2016 these analyses indicated the spatial characteristic of environmental burdens at the city level thus different areas should implement distinct policies for alleviating potential environmental impacts considering that the high high cluster cities are the major crop production areas the curtailment of environmental impacts cannot be achieved by cutting the production scale in these regions meanwhile the majority of high high cluster cities are classified as optimized development areas in the sustainable agricultural development plan moa 2015b these regions should promote the application of environment friendly producing technologies and enhance their radiation capability for the regions in the low agricultural development level not only the potential of suitable agricultural products should be tapped on the basis of regional resource endowments and agricultural comparative advantages but attention should also be focused on potential environmental impacts furthermore strengthening interregional communication encouraging cross region cooperation and jointly promoting sustainable agricultural development in areas with similar endowment resources through clustering effects are necessary urbanization level gdp per capita precipitation cultivated area effective irrigation area proportion fertilizer use intensity and diesel use intensity were selected to explore the underlying factors driving the spatial heterogeneity of water footprint analysis results in this study table a 6 as shown in table a 7 the impact of socioeconomic factors i e urbanization level and gdp per capita on environmental burdens was insignificant at the city level precipitation and cultivated area were the reflections of regional water and land resource endowment which were negatively and positively correlated with environmental impacts at the 1 level respectively abundant precipitation could reduce the irrigation consumption and the environmental impacts related to water consumption conversely the increase in cultivated area promoted the agricultural development while also increasing the risks of environmental impacts the effective irrigation area proportion was significantly correlated with the human health impact whereas the contribution of reducing irrigation water to the reduction in ecosystem quality impact was insignificant this discrepancy was mainly due to that the contribution of irrigation water to the human health impact was higher than that to the ecosystem quality impact fig 2 the expansion of effective irrigation area is conductive to increasing crop yields and means enhanced potential environmental impacts cao et al 2020 the fertilizer use intensity exhibited a negative correlation with the environmental impacts on human health and ecosystem quality with correlation coefficients of 0 216 and 0 221 at the significance level of 1 respectively a similar relationship was observed in the environmental impacts with diesel use intensity these results indicated that the environmental damage originated from crop production is rising with the increase in agricultural input intensity i e fertilizer and diesel consistent with the analysis of key factors improving the utilization efficiency of fertilizer and diesel is necessary to abate environmental impacts 4 conclusions this study focused on identifying the key factors exploring the spatiotemporal variation and providing recommendations for crop production in china from the perspective of water footprint direct consumption fertilizer production and diesel production were the key factors that exerted substantial environmental impacts the lmdi approach was adopted to explore the driving factors behind the temporal variations in water footprint analysis results which increased during 2008 2015 and decreased in 2016 agricultural economic scale drove mostly the increase in environmental impacts whereas crop productivity exhibited a conflicting contribution in consideration of the impossibility of restraining agricultural economic growth increasing crop productivity was a superior option to facilitate burden reduction local moran s i values implied that high high agglomerations were mainly concentrated in the north china plain and yangtze river delta which could be attributed to their superior natural resource endowment and large demand for agricultural products advanced agricultural technology should be vigorously prompted in these areas to enhance their radiation capability and drive the overall sustainable agricultural development the correlation analysis demonstrated that the spatial variation in environmental impacts was positively affected by cultivated land fertilizer intensity diesel intensity and effective irrigation area proportion whereas precipitation correlated negatively with environmental burdens overall promoting water saving agricultural practices and improving the efficiency of fertilizer and diesel use are highly recommended to ameliorate the environmental performance the conclusions generated from this study can provide theoretical evidence for decision makers to implement targeted agricultural management policies in this study we merely conducted a correlation analysis without considering spatial spillover effects further investigation on the regional differences in the influencing factors of environmental impacts will be conducted in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9929,the response of soil moisture to precipitation is likely greatly affected by precipitation properties and plant communities via influencing hydrological processes linking atmosphere vegetation soil continuum nevertheless few studies have been carried out to investigate these responds after revegetation on steep gully slope in arid and semi arid regions this study was conducted to quantify the response of soil moisture to precipitation properties on steep gully slopes covered by different plant communities on the loess plateau soil moisture was measured consecutively at 20 min intervals from may 2019 to october 2020 for one bare land as control and two shrub and four grass communities the results demonstrated that the response of soil moisture to precipitation at event scale varied greatly with rainfall types and occurred months the dominant factors were precipitation amount intensity and soil initial water content for the changes in soil moisture of 10 cm and 30 cm soil layers and the lag time of 10 cm soil layer whereas for the lag time of 30 cm soil layer they were slope gradient and precipitation duration at monthly scale soil moisture varied greatly within 0 100 cm soil layers following a trend of decreasing january to june increasing july to september and decreasing october to december however soil moisture was almost stable for soil depth deeper than 100 cm and only fluctuated under either extreme rainstorms or series of consecutive precipitations at annual scale soil water storage was similar between the year of 2019 and 2020 but varied greatly between different plant communities attributed to the differences in above ground biomass field capacity and land surface roughness their relative contributions were 71 6 22 1 and 5 8 these results are helpful to understand the temporal changes in soil hydrological processes and to choose vegetation restoration model on steep gully slopes in arid and semi arid regions keywords soil moisture precipitation properties temporal variation vegetation restoration steep slope 1 introduction soil moisture is a critical parameter linking atmosphere vegetation soil continuum which greatly affects many meteorological hydrological and ecological processes via influencing evapotranspiration water infiltration runoff generation soil erosion and solute transportation ding et al 2021 ersahin and brohi 2006 su and shangguan 2018 as a crucial water resource for vegetation growth soil moisture plays a pivotal role in the rehabilitation and sustainable development of the degraded ecosystem especially in arid and semi arid regions where the potential evapotranspiration substantially significant exceeds the precipitation cheng et al 2020 hu et al 2011 under the background of global warming improving the knowledge related to the dynamic of soil moisture is of significant importance in water resource management to facilitate vegetation restoration sustainability and understand the related eco hydrological processes since the ecosystems in these regions are fragile and sensitive to climatic change huang et al 2016 su and shangguan 2018 hence it is necessary to investigate the temporal variation and vertical distribution of soil moisture under different conditions in arid and semi arid regions great efforts have been carried out to study soil moisture in the past several decades and clearly revealed that soil moisture and its dynamic are of great spatio temporal variability and affected by multiple factors including precipitation topography soil properties vegetation and land use type cheng et al 2020 farley et al 2005 gao and shao 2012 zhao et al 2017 generally soil moisture of surface soil layer 0 40 cm increases rapidly after precipitation cheng et al 2020 wang et al 2013 whereas declines gradually across soil profile after re vegetation farley et al 2005 jia et al 2017 due to the differences in precipitation evapotranspiration and vegetation growth soil moisture of south facing slope is markedly lower than that of north facing one in the northern hemisphere yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b moreover soil water content decreases with slope gradient yang et al 2014 zhu et al 2014 however influenced by soil hydraulic characteristics and eco hydrological functions soil moisture varies greatly with soil texture and land use types feki et al 2018 meskini vishkaee et al 2014 zhang et al 2019b among these influencing factors precipitation and vegetation are widely recognized as the dominant factors controlling soil moisture after vegetation restoration cheng et al 2020 duan et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 the influence of precipitation on soil moisture and its dynamic is timescale dependent and mainly controlled by its amount intensity duration and frequency cheng et al 2020 he et al 2012 yang et al 2014 however the dominant influencing factors and degree differed greatly between different timescales for long time scales such as annual seasonal and monthly soil moisture and its dynamic across soil profile are mainly affected by precipitation amount wang et al 2017a investigated soil moisture along the precipitation gradient on the loess plateau and found that the mean soil moisture increased with annual precipitation amount due to the differences in consumption and replenishment soil moisture of shallow soil layer 0 100 cm varies greatly between different seasons and months cheng et al 2020 yang et al 2014 yu et al 2018 cheng et al 2020 revealed that during one growing season soil moisture decreased firstly due to the consumption of vegetation growth then increased sharply with the concentrated precipitations and finally decreased gradually due to the evapotranspiration nevertheless for short time scales i e rainfall event the effect of precipitation on soil moisture is mainly concentrated on top soil layer 0 20 cm and closely related to its properties i e amount intensity duration and frequency generally soil moisture increases with precipitation amount cheng et al 2020 heisler white et al 2008 wang et al 2017a under a similar precipitation amount soil moisture increases with intensity albertson and kiely 2001 he et al 2012 besides precipitation frequency also greatly affects soil moisture he et al 2012 concluded that series of consecutive precipitations even increased soil moisture of deep soil layer due to the superimposition effect the effect of vegetation on soil moisture and its dynamic is primarily controlled by its effects on hydrological processes including interception infiltration runoff generation and evapotranspiration all these processes are closely related to plant species community above ground biomass canopy coverage leaf area index plant litter density and root mass density and its vertical distribution aijm and keenan 2007 jian et al 2015 su and shangguan 2018 wang et al 2017a in general a large scale of vegetation restoration leads to the increase of above ground biomass canopy coverage and leaf area index which promotes the interception of precipitation and evapotranspiration of soil water thereby reducing soil moisture su and shangguan 2018 zhang et al 2020 nevertheless the local soil moisture may also increase with canopy coverage since it can reduce the wind speed and decrease temperature via shading thereby reducing evaporation a et al 2019 the effect of plant litter on soil moisture and its dynamic is complex before the runoff generates it may decrease soil moisture via intercepting precipitation he et al 2012 whereas once the runoff generated plant litter may increase soil moisture via promoting infiltration through increasing land surface roughness and improving soil structure indirectly zhu et al 2014 2020a b the influence of plant root on soil moisture is mainly controlled by its density and vertical distribution nippert et al 2012 wang et al 2017a zhang and huang 2021 nippert et al 2012 concluded that the distribution pattern and level of soil moisture at the root zone could be determined via investigating the root profile distribution extensive root systems may result in soil water deficits even the occurrence of soil desiccation mendham et al 2011 wang et al 2010 however plant traits soil properties and infiltration capacity as well as vegetation characteristics mentioned above all differed significantly between different species or communities zhang et al 2020 zhu et al 2020a b as a result soil moisture and its dynamic likely differ greatly between different plant species or communities some previous studies confirmed that under similar conditions soil moisture of forestland was the lowest followed by shrub land grassland and farmland on hillslopes in semi arid regions i e the loess plateau su and shangguan 2018 wang et al 2017a zhao et al 2017 moreover wang et al 2011 also found that soil moisture of the native species was higher than that of exotic species on the loess plateau the steep gully slope is an important landform of the small watershed in the hilly and gully region on the loess plateau with distinct features of highly fragmented terrain steep slope poor vegetation and serious soil erosion zhang et al 2019a zhu et al 2020a it locates below the shoulder line and above the gully channel steep gully slope accounts for approximately 42 of watershed area but produces 52 82 of the total watershed sediment yield consequently steep gully slope was recognized as the main sediment contributor of small watersheds in the hilly and gully region of the loess plateau zhang et al 2019a hence more attention should be paid to control soil erosion on steep gully slopes the response of soil moisture and its dynamic to precipitation is of significant importance to hydrological and erosion processes however most related previous studies were conducted on gentle hillslopes he et al 2012 melliger and niemann 2010 wang et al 2013 zhu et al 2014 nevertheless the topography i e slope gradient soil properties i e organic matter content water stable aggregate content and infiltration properties and vegetation properties i e plant species diversity above ground biomass litter density and root mass density of steep gully slope differed greatly from gentle hillslope yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a zhu et al 2020a these differences certainly induce the differences in the response of soil moisture to precipitation between gentle hillslope and steep gully slope thereby hydrological and erosion processes therefore it is vital to investigate the response of soil moisture to precipitation on steep gully slopes covered by different plant communities in arid and semi arid regions up to date due to the difficulty and time consuming of in situ soil moisture measurement previous studies about soil moisture conducted on steep slopes basically focus on assessing the multi effects of vegetation restoration on soil moisture under different plant species during one growing season via several times measurement duan et al 2016 gao et al 2016 yu et al 2018 the response of soil moisture to precipitation properties as well as its influencing factors on steep gully slopes are still unclear therefore in this study a long term and consecutive measurement of soil moisture from may 2019 to october 2020 across 0 200 cm profile was performed to 1 investigate the response of soil moisture to precipitation events with different amounts and occurred in different months and identify its main influencing factors 2 determine the temporal variation and vertical distribution of soil moisture at monthly scale 3 compare the differences in soil water storage between different plant communities at annual scale and quantify the relative contributions of its main influencing factors on steep gully slopes in arid and semi arid regions i e the loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and testing sites this study was performed in the zhifanggou watershed area 8 27 km2 elevation 1010 1431 m a s l of ansai county shannxi province locates in the central part of the loess plateau and belongs to the typical hilly and gully region fig 1 the watershed features a typical arid and semi arid continental monsoon climate with a mean annual precipitation of 505 mm and a mean annual air temperature of 8 8 based on the 37 year meteorological records 1970 2006 however approximately 70 of the precipitation concentrates mainly between june and september as short heavy storms the dominant soil type in the watershed is a calcaric regosols wrb soil classification system with a texture of typical silt loam usda soil texture classes developed from aeolian loess parent materials zhu et al 2020a due to the implementation of the grain for green project in 1999 most of the farmland on steep gully slope has been restored to shrub land and grassland by natural succession or artificial planting currently the principal land use types are farmland orchard grassland shrub land and forestland based on the detailed field investigation across the whole watershed one bare land bl two typical shrub communities of caragana korshinskii ck and hippophae rhamnoides hr and four typical grass communities of artemisia sacrorum as artemisia giraldii ag bothriochloa ischaemum bi and carex lanceolata cl distributed on different steep gully slopes were selected as the testing sites fig 1 except for caragana korshinskii was restored by artificial planting other five plant communities were restored by natural succession moreover the slope gradient and previous tillage operations of the selected seven tested sites are similar and not disturbed by human activities for more than twenty years the basic information of each tested site is listed in table 1 2 2 soil moisture measurement and soil water storage calculation to measure soil volumetric moisture sm seven sets of ech2o soil moisture temperature monitor system with thirty five 5tm sensors decagon devices inc pullman washington usa were installed at seven testing sites in april 2019 at each tested sites five sensors were installed to measure soil volumetric moisture due to the limitation of soil depth in hr community 80 cm soil volumetric moisture was measured at depths of 10 20 30 40 and 60 cm for other six sites sm was measured at depths of 10 30 60 100 and 160 cm fig 1 the basic principle of 5tm sensor is to measure the apparent dielectric constant of the surrounding medium using capacitance with a frequency of 70 mhz then calculate soil volumetric moisture li et al 2013 soil volumetric moisture was saved by decagon s em50 data logger at 20 min intervals the measurement scope of 5tm sensor ranges from 0 to 100 with an accuracy of 0 08 the traditional oven dry method is widely recognized as the most accurate method for soil moisture measurement bittelli et al 2008 thus soil volumetric moisture measured by ech2o soil moisture temperature monitor system with 5tm sensor was calibrated by oven dry method one month after the installation of the soil moisture temperature monitor system the gravimetrical soil moistures at depths of 10 30 60 100 and 160 cm 10 20 30 40 and 60 cm for hr were measured by oven dry method using a drill diameter of 2 5 cm the sampling sites were about 0 5 m away from the installing position of 5tm sensors the drilled holes were filled by soil after sampling to eliminate its influences on soil moisture measurement soil volumetric moisture was calculated by multiplying the measured gravimetrical soil moisture and bulk density ech2o soil moisture temperature monitor systems were calibrated by six times of measured results via oven dry method 30 data in total for each site the calibrated linear relationships between soil volumetric moisture measured by oven dry method and ech2o soil moisture temperature monitor system with 5tm sensor are showing in table 2 the coefficients of determination were greater than 0 949 which indicated that 5tm sensor could measure soil moisture accurately soil water storage sws was calculated based on the following equation 1 s w s i 1 n θ i h i 10 where n is the number of soil layers divided to measure soil moisture θ i is the soil volumetric moisture cm3 cm 3 of the i th soil layer and h i is the corresponding soil thickness cm in this study soil volumetric moistures at depths of 10 30 60 100 and 160 cm were recognized as the mean soil moistures for layers of 0 20 20 40 40 80 80 120 and 120 200 cm 2 3 precipitation properties calculation and precipitation events selection two self recording tipping bucket rain gauges 6465 m with a 0 2 mm resolution were installed nearby the tested sites to record precipitation data at 1 min interval fig 1 according to the recorded precipitation data the event precipitation properties of amount pa duration pd mean intensity mpi and the maximum intensities of 5 minute i 5 30 minute i 30 and 60 minute i 60 were calculated using rainrecord software version 1 06 which was developed by beijing normal university based on the calculated precipitation amount precipitation events of different rainfall types and with similar amount but occurred in different months were selected rainfall types are classified according to the precipitation grade standard issued by the national meteorological administration of china which are light rain pa 10 mm moderate rain 10 pa 25 mm heavy rain 25 pa 50 mm and rainstorm 50 pa 100 mm in this study four events of different rainfall types were selected they were light rain august 26 2019 moderate rain august 23 2019 heavy rain september 12 2019 and rainstorm july 21 2019 three precipitation events with similar precipitation amount approximately 20 mm but occurred in different months during one growing season were also chosen which occurred in june june 11 2020 july july 17 2020 and august august 23 2020 the detailed information about the precipitation properties of the selected precipitation events is showing in table 3 2 4 soil and vegetation properties measurement soil properties of texture sand silt and clay contents bulk density bd organic matter content som total porosity tp capillary porosity cp and field capacity fc were determined for three replicates at each soil layer 0 20 20 40 40 80 80 120 120 200 cm soil texture was determined using mastersizer 2000 som was determined by potassium dichromate colorimetric method the detailed procedures were described in our previously published paper zhu et al 2020a bd fc and tp were measured using undistributed soil samples collected by steel rings 5 05 cm in diameter 5 00 cm in height before the measurement the collected undistributed soil samples were saturated in a container for approximately 10 h then placed on a dry sand layer to drain water by gravity for approximately 8 h and weighted m 2 a filter paper was used to separate the soil sample and sand layer after that soil samples were oven dried 105 for 24 h and weighted m 3 tp and fc were calculated based on the following equations 2 b d m 3 m 1 v 3 t p 1 b d ρ 100 4 f c m 2 m 3 m 3 m 1 100 where bd is the soil bulk density g cm 3 m 1 is the weight of steel ring g v is the volume of steel ring cm3 ρ is the soil particle density g cm 3 and 2 65 was assumed in this study hao et al 2020 since soil properties were not changed greatly over a short period therefore all these properties were only measured for one time additionally land surface roughness lsr was measured by photogrammetric method for three replicates the detailed procedures were described in our previously published paper zhu et al 2020b for each site vegetation properties of plant coverage pc and leaf area index lai were measured monthly by photogrammetric method from july to october 2019 and june to october 2020 for six replicates at two nearby micro runoff plots 3 m in length 1 m in width which were established in may 2018 whereas above ground biomass agb litter density ld and root mass density rmd were measured monthly from july to october 2019 and may to october 2020 nearby runoff plots for three replicates photos taken by a camera canon eos 80d with a regular lens canon ef50 mm f 1 8 stm right above the plant were used to calculate plant coverage by pcover software photos taken by a camera canon eos 80d with a fisheye lens sigma 8 mm f3 5 ex dg right above the plant were applied to calculated lai by can eye software version 6 4 95 juárez et al 2009 when photographing the whole runoff plot should be within the camera lens as far as possible moreover to diminish the influences of sunlight photos were taken when there was no sunlight the harvested and oven dry method was used to determine agb a quadrat method was applied to determine ld the root drilling diameter in 9 cm method was utilized to determine rmd at 10 cm soil depth intervals the detailed procedures measuring agb ld and rmd were described in our previously published paper zhu et al 2020a 2 5 data analysis main factors attributing to the differences in the response of soil moisture to precipitation under different plant communities were identified by path analysis the relative contributions of main factors attributed to the differences in soil water storage between different plant communities were quantified by multiple stepwise regression analysis all data were analyzed by ibm spss statistics software version 21 0 and figures were mapped by origin pro 2016 software the temporal and vertical distribution of soil moisture were mapped using universal kriging interpolation in arcgis software version 10 7 3 results 3 1 characteristics of precipitation soil and vegetation properties during the study period from january 1 2019 to october 21 2020 the total recorded precipitations were 485 8 mm and 508 6 mm in 2019 and 2020 fig 2 the maximum monthly precipitations occurred in august which were 115 6 mm and 287 2 mm accounting for approximately 23 8 and 56 5 of the total precipitation it was clear that the seasonal distribution of precipitation was extremely uneven in 2020 and concentrated more on august soil properties varied greatly between different plant communities table 1 hr had the minimum sand and the maximum clay contents whereas cl had the maximum sand and the minimum clay contents as had the minimum bulk density and the maximum total porosity and field capacity whereas bi had the maximum bulk density and the minimum total porosity and cl had the minimum field capacity nevertheless with the increase of soil depth the changing trends of most soil properties except for silt content were almost similar fig 3 due to the influences of soil erosion and vegetation restoration sand content total porosity and field capacity decreased significantly whereas clay content and bulk density increased significantly with the increase of soil depth within shallow soil layers 0 100 cm and then reached a relatively stable stage within deep soil layers 100 200 cm vegetation properties fluctuated greatly during one growing season fig 4 plant above ground biomass canopy coverage and leaf area index increased firstly and reached the maximum in august then decreased gradually nevertheless fluctuated increasing trends were found in plant litter density and root mass density overall ck had the maximum agb ld and rmd cl had the maximum pc and lai whereas as had the minimum pc agb ld and lai table 1 in addition rmd decreased rapidly with soil depth within surface soil layer 0 40 cm then decreased gradually within the deeper soil layer 40 120 cm fig 3 g these differences in soil and vegetation properties as well as their temporal variation and vertical distribution are hypothesized to influence the response of soil moisture to precipitation and contribute to the differences in soil water storage between different plant communities 3 2 response of soil moisture to precipitation and plant communities at event scale the response of soil moisture to precipitation at event scale was reflected by the change in soil moisture δ s m and lag time in this study δ s m was defined as the difference between the maximum soil moisture after precipitation and the initial soil moisture at the beginning of precipitation the lag time was the time from the beginning of precipitation to the point of soil moisture starting to increase triggered by precipitation the results showed that the response of soil moisture to precipitation was greatly influenced by rainfall type overall δ s m increased with precipitation amount under different plant communities but it was not true for all cases fig 5 for instance δ s m of as for soil depth of 10 cm was only 0 5 under heavy rain which was significantly lower than that under light rain 4 1 and moderate rain 4 9 compared to bare land the mean δ s m of top 10 cm soil layer of grass community decreased by 41 2 50 7 49 0 and 3 7 under light rain moderate rain heavy rain and rainstorm whereas for shrub community δ s m decreased by 20 6 and 46 7 under light rain and moderate rain but increased by 77 6 and 19 1 under heavy rain and rainstorm for the lag time it increased with soil depth moreover the lag times of steep gully slopes covered by different plant communities were longer than that of bare land under light rain moderate rain and heavy rain whereas was almost the same in the rainstorm fig 5 furthermore the differences in the lag time between different plant communities decreased with precipitation amount and intensity in other word the influences of plant community on the lag time reduced with precipitation amount and intensity however no significant trend was detected between different rainfall types for precipitation events with similar amount approximately 20 mm the response of soil moisture to precipitation also varied greatly with months during one growing season fig 6 in this study the differences in response effect to precipitation events between different months were analyzed for three sites they were bare land bl shrub community of ck and grass community of ag the results showed that shrub community of ck had the maximum δ s m in these three months which were 13 6 9 6 and 7 2 from june to august then followed by bare land bl and grass community of ag which were 10 3 5 4 7 1 and 6 2 2 3 5 4 respectively fig 6 moreover the largest δ s m within top soil layer 10 cm were found in june whereas the smallest ones of bl and ag were detected in july and that of ck was in august fig 6 for the lag time shrub community of ck had the shortest lag times in these three months whereas grass communities of ag had the longest ones fig 6 the longest lag times of the selected three sites were found in july whereas that of the shortest were detected in august fig 6 since the response of soil moisture to precipitation was obvious within 10 cm and 30 cm soil layers thus the main influencing factors were also analyzed in these two soil layers the results of path analysis indicated that δ s m and the lag time were jointly affected by precipitation properties vegetation and soil properties and topography parameters figs 7 and 8 for top 10 cm soil layer δ s m was dominantly affected by i 5 iwc lai and ld it increased with i 5 and ld whereas decreased with iwc and lai with the path coefficients of 0 92 0 02 0 66 and 0 21 respectively for 30 cm soil layer δ s m was mainly affected by pa mpi iwc and ld it increased with pa mpi and ld whereas declined with iwc with the path coefficients of 2 69 2 75 0 53 and 2 55 respectively the lag time of top 10 cm soil layer was dominantly controlled by pa mpi iwc and ld it decreased with pa and mpi whereas increased with iwc and ld with the path coefficients of 0 67 0 61 0 61 and 0 43 whereas the lag time of 30 cm soil layer was mainly influenced by pd slope gradient and fc the lag time reduced with pd and slope gradient whereas it increased with fc with the path coefficients of 0 30 0 46 and 0 16 3 3 response of soil moisture to precipitation and plant communities at monthly scale soil moisture exhibited a similar trend for all sites during one year at monthly scale fig 9 soil moisture of surface soil layer 0 40 cm for hr and 0 100 cm for other six plant communities decreased gradually from january to approximately june then increased sharply to about september and finally decreased gradually to december overall soil moisture of shallow soil layer 0 100 cm fluctuated greatly over time whereas it was relatively stable within deep soil layer 100 200 cm only increased under extreme rainstorms or series of consecutive precipitations such as august 2020 all above mentioned results indicated that precipitation could generally replenish soil water above 100 cm layer whereas for deep soil layer it could only be replenished under extreme rainstorms or series of consecutive precipitations on steep gully slope the vertical distribution of soil moisture across the profile was different between different plant communities fig 10 a with the increase of soil depth soil moisture increased firstly and then decreased for plant communities of bl hr ag and bi but for other three plant communities soil moisture exhibited a complex trend of decrease increase decrease nevertheless the maximum soil moisture was detected within soil layer from 60 cm to 100 cm for all plant communities fig 10 a additionally the coefficients of variation of soil moisture decreased gradually with the increase of soil depth fig 10 b which confirmed again that soil moisture became more stable with the increase of soil depth however the coefficients of variation of soil moisture in the deepest soil layer 160 cm could be greater than that of the upper soil layer triggered by extreme rainstorm replenishment fig 10 c 3 4 response of soil water storage to precipitation and plant communities at annual scale no significant difference was found in soil water storage sws between different years whereas it varied greatly between different plant communities fig 11 since sws of hr was calculated from only 0 80 cm soil layer whereas for other six plant communities sws were computed from 0 200 cm soil layer thus sws of hr was not included in the following analysis the results demonstrated that cl had the maximum sws followed by bi as bl ag and ck which were 452 88 417 32 392 96 347 52 346 93 and 193 55 mm respectively compared to bl the mean sws of shrub community decreased by 44 3 whereas that of grass community increased by 15 8 the results of multiple stepwise regression analysis indicated that the differences in sws between different plant communities were dominantly controlled by plant above ground biomass soil field capacity and land surface roughness which explained approximately 99 5 of the total difference table 4 moreover no significant correlations were found between agb fc and lsr table 5 thus the effects of their interactions could be negligible consequently agb played the most important role in the differences in sws between different plant communities with the relative contribution of 71 6 then followed by fc and lsr with the relative contributions of 22 1 and 5 8 table 4 4 discussions 4 1 response of soil moisture to precipitation and plant communities at event scale the response of soil moisture to precipitation differed greatly between different rainfall types and occurred months figs 5 and 6 which were closely related to precipitation properties vegetation and soil properties and topography parameters figs 7 and 8 overall the change in soil moisture δ s m increased with precipitation amount and intensity fig 7 this result is in accordance with the results of some previous studies albertson and kiely 2001 he et al 2012 heisler white et al 2008 who found that precipitation with small amount and low intensity was easy to lose via canopy and litter interception he et al 2012 the δ s m of as within top 10 cm soil layer under heavy rain was smaller than that under light and moderate rains fig 5 which was induced by the high initial water content before heavy rain in the studied region soil infiltration is a typical process of intensity excess soil with high initial soil moisture will decrease the suction gradient between wet and dry soil layers reduces soil infiltration and is prone to generate runoff wei et al 2007 zhang et al 2019b zhu et al 2014 as a result δ s m decreased with iwc fig 7 the decrease in δ s m with lai was induced by the processes of interception and transpiration it is well known that plant with high lai consumes more precipitation and soil moisture via interception and transpiration duan et al 2016 the result of δ s m increased with plant litter density was inconsistent with the conclusion of sharafatmandrad et al 2010 who reported that plant litter could decrease δ s m via intercepting precipitation this difference was closely related to whether runoff generated or not generally before runoff generates plant litter decreases precipitation via interception he et al 2012 thereby reducing the change in soil moisture however once runoff generated the undecomposed litter covered on soil surface could increase land surface roughness and promote infiltration via slowing down runoff and increasing its residence time pannkuk and robichaud 2003 wang et al 2020b zhu et al 2020a moreover the decomposed plant litter which had been incorporated into top soil layer could also improve soil structure via protecting surface soil from consolidation thereby promoting infiltration properties as well as increasing soil moisture indirectly zhu et al 2020a therefore δ s m of shrub communities under light rain and moderate rain were lower than that of bare land whereas that under heavy rain and rainstorm were greater than that of bare land since runoff generated for ck however δ s m of grass communities under all rainfall types were lower than that of bare land this result was attributed to the comprehensive effects of plant canopy litter and biological soil crust except for the interception of plant canopy and litter biological soil crust also prevented water from infiltration thus decreased the change in soil moisture chamizo et al 2013 wang et al 2017b in this study cyanobacterial crusts developed in grass communities which can form a relatively non porous layer when they are wetted chamizo et al 2012 wang et al 2017b and further prevents surface runoff from infiltration and decreases δ s m directly furthermore induced by the low value of agb pc lai and iwc among three tested months figs 4 and 6 δ s m of june was the largest for the lag time it decreased with precipitation amount duration and intensity fig 8 as mentioned above precipitation with small amount and low intensity was easy to lose via canopy and litter interception he et al 2012 which increased the lag time the positive effect of iwc and ld on the lag time within 10 cm top soil layer was induced by low infiltration and high runoff rate of soils with high initial water content zhang et al 2019b and soil surface covered by more plant litter could intercept more precipitation before it infiltrated into soil sharafatmandrad et al 2010 the lag time decreased with slope gradient at soil depth of 30 cm was confirmed by some previous studies who concluded that soil infiltration rate increased with slope gradient janeau et al 2003 morbidelli et al 2018 the reason was probably that runoff velocity and soil erosion increased with slope gradient which wrecked soil physical crust and produced great land surface roughness thereby increasing infiltration rate janeau et al 2003 zhu et al 2020b moreover the lag time increased with field capacity was easy to understand that soils with high field capacity had great potential to store water robertson et al 2021 nevertheless despite of the fact that the selected precipitation events in july had the maximum precipitation intensity whereas the lag time was the longest which is not consistent with the results of some previous studies this result was likely triggered by the process of soil consolidation the intensity of the selected precipitation event in july was far greater than those selected in june and august table 3 which was prone to breakdown soil aggregate via raindrop to form soil crust wang et al 2016 zhang and xie 2019 as a result soil surface permeability decreased significantly and the lag time increased robinson and woodun 2008 thus we speculated that there was a threshold existing in precipitation intensity to form soil crust and further to prevent infiltration process and affect soil moisture when the precipitation intensity was less than the threshold infiltration rate and the lag time of soil moisture increased with precipitation intensity whereas when it was greater than the threshold they decreased with precipitation intensity however the speculated threshold was unclear in this study and further studies are needed in future to investigate it 4 2 response of soil moisture to precipitation and plant communities at monthly scale the temporal variation in soil moisture was closely related to soil water consumption and replenishment since both precipitation and vegetation properties varied greatly during one year figs 2 and 4 in this study soil moisture of shallow 0 100 cm soil layer changed over time with a pattern of decreasing january to june increasing july to september and decreasing october to december fig 9 the decreasing trend from january to approximately june and october to december was induced by soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration shao et al 2021 whereas the increasing trend from july to september was attributed to the concentrated precipitation on the loess plateau cheng et al 2020 though vegetation consumed a lot of soil water from july to september due to the great agb pc lai and rmd fig 4 soil moisture still increased significantly fig 9 which was also induced by the greatly concentrated precipitation within one year soil moisture was positively correlated with precipitation at monthly scale and the significant positive relationships were found at 10 and 30 cm soil layers for most sites moreover the correlation coefficients decreased with the increase of soil depth table 6 this result again confirmed that precipitation played a more significant role in increasing soil moisture in semi arid regions i e the loess plateau cheng et al 2020 wang et al 2017a and its influence decreased with the increase of soil depth in addition two obvious periods with low soil moisture were found from january to february and from may to june for surface soil layer 0 40 cm fig 9 the former was caused by the processes of freezing and thawing flerchinger et al 2006 since the air temperature at that time was lower than 0 fig 2 the latter was induced by the increasing consumption of soil water due to the beginning growth of vegetation cheng et al 2020 which was confirmed by the sharply increases in agb pc lai and rmd fig 3 and little precipitation occurred during these two months fig 2 furthermore soil moisture increased significantly across soil profile in august 2020 for all sites fig 9 which was triggered by consecutive precipitation events with short interval fig 2 the cumulative amount of precipitation produced a superimposition effect he et al 2012 increased soil moisture across the whole profile the vertical distribution of soil moisture was greatly influenced by the vertical distribution of plant roots dang et al 2020 sahaar and niemann 2020 su and shangguan 2018 in this study soil moisture fluctuated greatly within shallow soil layer 0 100 cm whereas it was almost stable within deep soil layer figs 9 and 10 b this result agrees with the results of some previous studies cheng et al 2020 dang et al 2020 wang et al 2017a on the loess plateau precipitation generally replenished soil water for shallow soil layer 0 100 cm figs 5 and 6 soil water consumption induced by vegetation growth was mainly from soil layer above 40 cm and hardly deeper than 100 cm except for ck wang et al 2010 due to the vertical distribution of plant root systems fig 3 g this was also the reason why the maximum soil moisture of all sites appeared within the soil layer from 60 cm to 100 cm at annual scale fig 9 4 3 response of soil water storage to precipitation and plant communities at annual scale for long time scale soil moisture was dominantly controlled by precipitation amount wang et al 2017a in this study precipitation in 2020 508 6 mm was slightly greater than that in 2019 485 8 mm thus soil water storage of most plant communities in 2020 was also slightly greater than those in 2019 except for as and cl fig 11 however sws varied greatly between different plant communities which is consistent with the results of some previous studies wang et al 2013 2017a zhao et al 2017 generally sws declines gradually with vegetation restoration jia et al 2017 su and shangguan 2018 and the reduction increased with above ground biomass plant canopy coverage leaf area index and root mass density aijm and keenan 2007 duan et al 2016 jian et al 2015 zhu et al 2014 in this study ck had the maximum agb pc and rmd and as had the minimum ones table 1 fig 4 as a result ck had the minimum sws whereas cl had the maximum sws but not as fig 11 the reason is that cl locates at a north facing slope with low elevation and nearby the gully channel and a greater sws was expected moreover sws of bi was also greater than that of as this result was attributed to the fact that bi had a fibrous root system and a soil with high clay content plants with fibrous root systems consume less water dang et al 2020 zhao et al 2017 soils with high clay content generally have a large specific surface area thereby a strong water retaining capacity and soil water is hard to evaporate and drain li et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b some previous studies concluded that no significant difference was found in soil moisture between hillslope and steep gully slope under different land use types gao et al 2016 yu et al 2018 in this study compared to the results of hillslope reported by xiao et al 2016 in the same watershed soil water storage 0 200 cm soil layer of hillslope 394 09 mm basically equaled to that of steep gully slope 392 96 mm for as whereas for ck sws of hillslope 252 05 mm was significantly greater than that of steep gully slope 193 55 mm this difference confirmed again that the replenishment of rainfall to soil moisture was less than soil moisture consumed by ck zhao et al 2017 as a result sm declined with the growth age of ck our measurement was 9 years later than their study xiao et al 2016 and low sws was expected it also indicated indirectly that vegetation restoration via planting ck has huge risk to form dry soil layer on steep gully slopes due to the continuous decrease of soil moisture nevertheless except for ag sws of other three grass communities were greater than that of bare land fig 11 this result differed from the results of previous studies wang et al 2013 2017a zhao et al 2017 this difference could be explained by that bare land locates above the gully sidewall and biological soil crust developed in most grass communities firstly due to the development of gully slope length was shortened greatly which certainly reduced surface runoff infiltration wang et al 2020a secondly influenced by gravity the infiltrated water would decline rapidly via drainage during and after precipitation events melliger and niemann 2010 thirdly soil evaporation and growth of vegetation on the gully sidewall also likely reduced soil moisture significantly wang et al 2020a zheng et al 2006 fourthly as mentioned above the development of cyanobacterial crusts in grass communities can form a relatively non porous layer chamizo et al 2012 wang et al 2017b which can slow down the loss of soil moisture from evaporation chamizo et al 2013 and likely result in greater soil moisture of grass communities than that of bare land 4 4 implications for vegetation management on steep slope vegetation restoration on steep gully slope is of significant importance since it is the main sediment source in a small watershed of the loess hilly gully region zhang et al 2019a nevertheless large scale of inappropriate vegetation restoration has led to series of environmental problems i e the formation of dried soil layer and reduction of river flow discharge which may drastically change the hydrological cycle processes and greatly restrict the regional sustainability development ye et al 2019 moreover some studies reported that the thickness of dried soil layer on steep gully slope was greater than that on hillslope zhang et al 2021 zhang and huang 2021 therefore vegetation restoration and its proper management are extremely urgent on steep gully slopes in the arid and semi arid regions the results of the current study demonstrated that the differences in soil water storage between different plant communities were dominantly controlled by above ground biomass with a relative contribution of 71 6 table 4 however precipitation can hardly replenish soil water for soil layer deeper than 200 cm even 100 cm consequently from the aspects of soil water content and its storage plant communities with high above ground biomass and deep rooted systems i e robinia pseudoacacia caragana korshinskii and medicago sativa are not recommended during re vegetation on steep gully slopes in semi arid regions 5 conclusions this study was performed to investigate the response of soil moisture to precipitation properties on steep gully slopes under different plant communities based on the consecutive monitor of soil moisture from may 2019 to october 2020 due to the comprehensive effects of precipitation initial water content soil and vegetation properties and topography the response of soil moisture to precipitation varied greatly between different rainfall types and months the change in soil moisture of top 10 cm soil layer increased with i 5 and ld whereas it decreased with iwc and lai for top 30 cm soil layer δ s m increased with pa mpi and ld and decreased with iwc the lag time of top 10 cm soil layer decreased with pa and mpi and increased with iwc and ld but for top 30 cm soil layer it decreased with pd and slope gradient and increased with fc due to the joint influences of evapotranspiration and precipitation replenishment soil moisture fluctuated greatly during one year for shallow 0 100 cm soil layer with a pattern of decreasing january to june increasing july to september and decreasing october to december soil moisture of deep soil layer 100 cm was almost stable and could only be replenished under extreme rainstorm or series of consecutive precipitations furthermore due to the similar precipitation amount no significant difference was detected in soil water storage between the year of 2019 and 2020 but varied greatly between different plant communities the variations in sws between different plant communities were dominantly attributed to the differences in agb fc and lsr which explained approximately 99 5 of the differences compared to bare land sws of shrub community decreased by 44 3 whereas that of grass community increased by 15 8 therefore to maintain the sustainability of vegetation restoration

9929,the response of soil moisture to precipitation is likely greatly affected by precipitation properties and plant communities via influencing hydrological processes linking atmosphere vegetation soil continuum nevertheless few studies have been carried out to investigate these responds after revegetation on steep gully slope in arid and semi arid regions this study was conducted to quantify the response of soil moisture to precipitation properties on steep gully slopes covered by different plant communities on the loess plateau soil moisture was measured consecutively at 20 min intervals from may 2019 to october 2020 for one bare land as control and two shrub and four grass communities the results demonstrated that the response of soil moisture to precipitation at event scale varied greatly with rainfall types and occurred months the dominant factors were precipitation amount intensity and soil initial water content for the changes in soil moisture of 10 cm and 30 cm soil layers and the lag time of 10 cm soil layer whereas for the lag time of 30 cm soil layer they were slope gradient and precipitation duration at monthly scale soil moisture varied greatly within 0 100 cm soil layers following a trend of decreasing january to june increasing july to september and decreasing october to december however soil moisture was almost stable for soil depth deeper than 100 cm and only fluctuated under either extreme rainstorms or series of consecutive precipitations at annual scale soil water storage was similar between the year of 2019 and 2020 but varied greatly between different plant communities attributed to the differences in above ground biomass field capacity and land surface roughness their relative contributions were 71 6 22 1 and 5 8 these results are helpful to understand the temporal changes in soil hydrological processes and to choose vegetation restoration model on steep gully slopes in arid and semi arid regions keywords soil moisture precipitation properties temporal variation vegetation restoration steep slope 1 introduction soil moisture is a critical parameter linking atmosphere vegetation soil continuum which greatly affects many meteorological hydrological and ecological processes via influencing evapotranspiration water infiltration runoff generation soil erosion and solute transportation ding et al 2021 ersahin and brohi 2006 su and shangguan 2018 as a crucial water resource for vegetation growth soil moisture plays a pivotal role in the rehabilitation and sustainable development of the degraded ecosystem especially in arid and semi arid regions where the potential evapotranspiration substantially significant exceeds the precipitation cheng et al 2020 hu et al 2011 under the background of global warming improving the knowledge related to the dynamic of soil moisture is of significant importance in water resource management to facilitate vegetation restoration sustainability and understand the related eco hydrological processes since the ecosystems in these regions are fragile and sensitive to climatic change huang et al 2016 su and shangguan 2018 hence it is necessary to investigate the temporal variation and vertical distribution of soil moisture under different conditions in arid and semi arid regions great efforts have been carried out to study soil moisture in the past several decades and clearly revealed that soil moisture and its dynamic are of great spatio temporal variability and affected by multiple factors including precipitation topography soil properties vegetation and land use type cheng et al 2020 farley et al 2005 gao and shao 2012 zhao et al 2017 generally soil moisture of surface soil layer 0 40 cm increases rapidly after precipitation cheng et al 2020 wang et al 2013 whereas declines gradually across soil profile after re vegetation farley et al 2005 jia et al 2017 due to the differences in precipitation evapotranspiration and vegetation growth soil moisture of south facing slope is markedly lower than that of north facing one in the northern hemisphere yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b moreover soil water content decreases with slope gradient yang et al 2014 zhu et al 2014 however influenced by soil hydraulic characteristics and eco hydrological functions soil moisture varies greatly with soil texture and land use types feki et al 2018 meskini vishkaee et al 2014 zhang et al 2019b among these influencing factors precipitation and vegetation are widely recognized as the dominant factors controlling soil moisture after vegetation restoration cheng et al 2020 duan et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 the influence of precipitation on soil moisture and its dynamic is timescale dependent and mainly controlled by its amount intensity duration and frequency cheng et al 2020 he et al 2012 yang et al 2014 however the dominant influencing factors and degree differed greatly between different timescales for long time scales such as annual seasonal and monthly soil moisture and its dynamic across soil profile are mainly affected by precipitation amount wang et al 2017a investigated soil moisture along the precipitation gradient on the loess plateau and found that the mean soil moisture increased with annual precipitation amount due to the differences in consumption and replenishment soil moisture of shallow soil layer 0 100 cm varies greatly between different seasons and months cheng et al 2020 yang et al 2014 yu et al 2018 cheng et al 2020 revealed that during one growing season soil moisture decreased firstly due to the consumption of vegetation growth then increased sharply with the concentrated precipitations and finally decreased gradually due to the evapotranspiration nevertheless for short time scales i e rainfall event the effect of precipitation on soil moisture is mainly concentrated on top soil layer 0 20 cm and closely related to its properties i e amount intensity duration and frequency generally soil moisture increases with precipitation amount cheng et al 2020 heisler white et al 2008 wang et al 2017a under a similar precipitation amount soil moisture increases with intensity albertson and kiely 2001 he et al 2012 besides precipitation frequency also greatly affects soil moisture he et al 2012 concluded that series of consecutive precipitations even increased soil moisture of deep soil layer due to the superimposition effect the effect of vegetation on soil moisture and its dynamic is primarily controlled by its effects on hydrological processes including interception infiltration runoff generation and evapotranspiration all these processes are closely related to plant species community above ground biomass canopy coverage leaf area index plant litter density and root mass density and its vertical distribution aijm and keenan 2007 jian et al 2015 su and shangguan 2018 wang et al 2017a in general a large scale of vegetation restoration leads to the increase of above ground biomass canopy coverage and leaf area index which promotes the interception of precipitation and evapotranspiration of soil water thereby reducing soil moisture su and shangguan 2018 zhang et al 2020 nevertheless the local soil moisture may also increase with canopy coverage since it can reduce the wind speed and decrease temperature via shading thereby reducing evaporation a et al 2019 the effect of plant litter on soil moisture and its dynamic is complex before the runoff generates it may decrease soil moisture via intercepting precipitation he et al 2012 whereas once the runoff generated plant litter may increase soil moisture via promoting infiltration through increasing land surface roughness and improving soil structure indirectly zhu et al 2014 2020a b the influence of plant root on soil moisture is mainly controlled by its density and vertical distribution nippert et al 2012 wang et al 2017a zhang and huang 2021 nippert et al 2012 concluded that the distribution pattern and level of soil moisture at the root zone could be determined via investigating the root profile distribution extensive root systems may result in soil water deficits even the occurrence of soil desiccation mendham et al 2011 wang et al 2010 however plant traits soil properties and infiltration capacity as well as vegetation characteristics mentioned above all differed significantly between different species or communities zhang et al 2020 zhu et al 2020a b as a result soil moisture and its dynamic likely differ greatly between different plant species or communities some previous studies confirmed that under similar conditions soil moisture of forestland was the lowest followed by shrub land grassland and farmland on hillslopes in semi arid regions i e the loess plateau su and shangguan 2018 wang et al 2017a zhao et al 2017 moreover wang et al 2011 also found that soil moisture of the native species was higher than that of exotic species on the loess plateau the steep gully slope is an important landform of the small watershed in the hilly and gully region on the loess plateau with distinct features of highly fragmented terrain steep slope poor vegetation and serious soil erosion zhang et al 2019a zhu et al 2020a it locates below the shoulder line and above the gully channel steep gully slope accounts for approximately 42 of watershed area but produces 52 82 of the total watershed sediment yield consequently steep gully slope was recognized as the main sediment contributor of small watersheds in the hilly and gully region of the loess plateau zhang et al 2019a hence more attention should be paid to control soil erosion on steep gully slopes the response of soil moisture and its dynamic to precipitation is of significant importance to hydrological and erosion processes however most related previous studies were conducted on gentle hillslopes he et al 2012 melliger and niemann 2010 wang et al 2013 zhu et al 2014 nevertheless the topography i e slope gradient soil properties i e organic matter content water stable aggregate content and infiltration properties and vegetation properties i e plant species diversity above ground biomass litter density and root mass density of steep gully slope differed greatly from gentle hillslope yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a zhu et al 2020a these differences certainly induce the differences in the response of soil moisture to precipitation between gentle hillslope and steep gully slope thereby hydrological and erosion processes therefore it is vital to investigate the response of soil moisture to precipitation on steep gully slopes covered by different plant communities in arid and semi arid regions up to date due to the difficulty and time consuming of in situ soil moisture measurement previous studies about soil moisture conducted on steep slopes basically focus on assessing the multi effects of vegetation restoration on soil moisture under different plant species during one growing season via several times measurement duan et al 2016 gao et al 2016 yu et al 2018 the response of soil moisture to precipitation properties as well as its influencing factors on steep gully slopes are still unclear therefore in this study a long term and consecutive measurement of soil moisture from may 2019 to october 2020 across 0 200 cm profile was performed to 1 investigate the response of soil moisture to precipitation events with different amounts and occurred in different months and identify its main influencing factors 2 determine the temporal variation and vertical distribution of soil moisture at monthly scale 3 compare the differences in soil water storage between different plant communities at annual scale and quantify the relative contributions of its main influencing factors on steep gully slopes in arid and semi arid regions i e the loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and testing sites this study was performed in the zhifanggou watershed area 8 27 km2 elevation 1010 1431 m a s l of ansai county shannxi province locates in the central part of the loess plateau and belongs to the typical hilly and gully region fig 1 the watershed features a typical arid and semi arid continental monsoon climate with a mean annual precipitation of 505 mm and a mean annual air temperature of 8 8 based on the 37 year meteorological records 1970 2006 however approximately 70 of the precipitation concentrates mainly between june and september as short heavy storms the dominant soil type in the watershed is a calcaric regosols wrb soil classification system with a texture of typical silt loam usda soil texture classes developed from aeolian loess parent materials zhu et al 2020a due to the implementation of the grain for green project in 1999 most of the farmland on steep gully slope has been restored to shrub land and grassland by natural succession or artificial planting currently the principal land use types are farmland orchard grassland shrub land and forestland based on the detailed field investigation across the whole watershed one bare land bl two typical shrub communities of caragana korshinskii ck and hippophae rhamnoides hr and four typical grass communities of artemisia sacrorum as artemisia giraldii ag bothriochloa ischaemum bi and carex lanceolata cl distributed on different steep gully slopes were selected as the testing sites fig 1 except for caragana korshinskii was restored by artificial planting other five plant communities were restored by natural succession moreover the slope gradient and previous tillage operations of the selected seven tested sites are similar and not disturbed by human activities for more than twenty years the basic information of each tested site is listed in table 1 2 2 soil moisture measurement and soil water storage calculation to measure soil volumetric moisture sm seven sets of ech2o soil moisture temperature monitor system with thirty five 5tm sensors decagon devices inc pullman washington usa were installed at seven testing sites in april 2019 at each tested sites five sensors were installed to measure soil volumetric moisture due to the limitation of soil depth in hr community 80 cm soil volumetric moisture was measured at depths of 10 20 30 40 and 60 cm for other six sites sm was measured at depths of 10 30 60 100 and 160 cm fig 1 the basic principle of 5tm sensor is to measure the apparent dielectric constant of the surrounding medium using capacitance with a frequency of 70 mhz then calculate soil volumetric moisture li et al 2013 soil volumetric moisture was saved by decagon s em50 data logger at 20 min intervals the measurement scope of 5tm sensor ranges from 0 to 100 with an accuracy of 0 08 the traditional oven dry method is widely recognized as the most accurate method for soil moisture measurement bittelli et al 2008 thus soil volumetric moisture measured by ech2o soil moisture temperature monitor system with 5tm sensor was calibrated by oven dry method one month after the installation of the soil moisture temperature monitor system the gravimetrical soil moistures at depths of 10 30 60 100 and 160 cm 10 20 30 40 and 60 cm for hr were measured by oven dry method using a drill diameter of 2 5 cm the sampling sites were about 0 5 m away from the installing position of 5tm sensors the drilled holes were filled by soil after sampling to eliminate its influences on soil moisture measurement soil volumetric moisture was calculated by multiplying the measured gravimetrical soil moisture and bulk density ech2o soil moisture temperature monitor systems were calibrated by six times of measured results via oven dry method 30 data in total for each site the calibrated linear relationships between soil volumetric moisture measured by oven dry method and ech2o soil moisture temperature monitor system with 5tm sensor are showing in table 2 the coefficients of determination were greater than 0 949 which indicated that 5tm sensor could measure soil moisture accurately soil water storage sws was calculated based on the following equation 1 s w s i 1 n θ i h i 10 where n is the number of soil layers divided to measure soil moisture θ i is the soil volumetric moisture cm3 cm 3 of the i th soil layer and h i is the corresponding soil thickness cm in this study soil volumetric moistures at depths of 10 30 60 100 and 160 cm were recognized as the mean soil moistures for layers of 0 20 20 40 40 80 80 120 and 120 200 cm 2 3 precipitation properties calculation and precipitation events selection two self recording tipping bucket rain gauges 6465 m with a 0 2 mm resolution were installed nearby the tested sites to record precipitation data at 1 min interval fig 1 according to the recorded precipitation data the event precipitation properties of amount pa duration pd mean intensity mpi and the maximum intensities of 5 minute i 5 30 minute i 30 and 60 minute i 60 were calculated using rainrecord software version 1 06 which was developed by beijing normal university based on the calculated precipitation amount precipitation events of different rainfall types and with similar amount but occurred in different months were selected rainfall types are classified according to the precipitation grade standard issued by the national meteorological administration of china which are light rain pa 10 mm moderate rain 10 pa 25 mm heavy rain 25 pa 50 mm and rainstorm 50 pa 100 mm in this study four events of different rainfall types were selected they were light rain august 26 2019 moderate rain august 23 2019 heavy rain september 12 2019 and rainstorm july 21 2019 three precipitation events with similar precipitation amount approximately 20 mm but occurred in different months during one growing season were also chosen which occurred in june june 11 2020 july july 17 2020 and august august 23 2020 the detailed information about the precipitation properties of the selected precipitation events is showing in table 3 2 4 soil and vegetation properties measurement soil properties of texture sand silt and clay contents bulk density bd organic matter content som total porosity tp capillary porosity cp and field capacity fc were determined for three replicates at each soil layer 0 20 20 40 40 80 80 120 120 200 cm soil texture was determined using mastersizer 2000 som was determined by potassium dichromate colorimetric method the detailed procedures were described in our previously published paper zhu et al 2020a bd fc and tp were measured using undistributed soil samples collected by steel rings 5 05 cm in diameter 5 00 cm in height before the measurement the collected undistributed soil samples were saturated in a container for approximately 10 h then placed on a dry sand layer to drain water by gravity for approximately 8 h and weighted m 2 a filter paper was used to separate the soil sample and sand layer after that soil samples were oven dried 105 for 24 h and weighted m 3 tp and fc were calculated based on the following equations 2 b d m 3 m 1 v 3 t p 1 b d ρ 100 4 f c m 2 m 3 m 3 m 1 100 where bd is the soil bulk density g cm 3 m 1 is the weight of steel ring g v is the volume of steel ring cm3 ρ is the soil particle density g cm 3 and 2 65 was assumed in this study hao et al 2020 since soil properties were not changed greatly over a short period therefore all these properties were only measured for one time additionally land surface roughness lsr was measured by photogrammetric method for three replicates the detailed procedures were described in our previously published paper zhu et al 2020b for each site vegetation properties of plant coverage pc and leaf area index lai were measured monthly by photogrammetric method from july to october 2019 and june to october 2020 for six replicates at two nearby micro runoff plots 3 m in length 1 m in width which were established in may 2018 whereas above ground biomass agb litter density ld and root mass density rmd were measured monthly from july to october 2019 and may to october 2020 nearby runoff plots for three replicates photos taken by a camera canon eos 80d with a regular lens canon ef50 mm f 1 8 stm right above the plant were used to calculate plant coverage by pcover software photos taken by a camera canon eos 80d with a fisheye lens sigma 8 mm f3 5 ex dg right above the plant were applied to calculated lai by can eye software version 6 4 95 juárez et al 2009 when photographing the whole runoff plot should be within the camera lens as far as possible moreover to diminish the influences of sunlight photos were taken when there was no sunlight the harvested and oven dry method was used to determine agb a quadrat method was applied to determine ld the root drilling diameter in 9 cm method was utilized to determine rmd at 10 cm soil depth intervals the detailed procedures measuring agb ld and rmd were described in our previously published paper zhu et al 2020a 2 5 data analysis main factors attributing to the differences in the response of soil moisture to precipitation under different plant communities were identified by path analysis the relative contributions of main factors attributed to the differences in soil water storage between different plant communities were quantified by multiple stepwise regression analysis all data were analyzed by ibm spss statistics software version 21 0 and figures were mapped by origin pro 2016 software the temporal and vertical distribution of soil moisture were mapped using universal kriging interpolation in arcgis software version 10 7 3 results 3 1 characteristics of precipitation soil and vegetation properties during the study period from january 1 2019 to october 21 2020 the total recorded precipitations were 485 8 mm and 508 6 mm in 2019 and 2020 fig 2 the maximum monthly precipitations occurred in august which were 115 6 mm and 287 2 mm accounting for approximately 23 8 and 56 5 of the total precipitation it was clear that the seasonal distribution of precipitation was extremely uneven in 2020 and concentrated more on august soil properties varied greatly between different plant communities table 1 hr had the minimum sand and the maximum clay contents whereas cl had the maximum sand and the minimum clay contents as had the minimum bulk density and the maximum total porosity and field capacity whereas bi had the maximum bulk density and the minimum total porosity and cl had the minimum field capacity nevertheless with the increase of soil depth the changing trends of most soil properties except for silt content were almost similar fig 3 due to the influences of soil erosion and vegetation restoration sand content total porosity and field capacity decreased significantly whereas clay content and bulk density increased significantly with the increase of soil depth within shallow soil layers 0 100 cm and then reached a relatively stable stage within deep soil layers 100 200 cm vegetation properties fluctuated greatly during one growing season fig 4 plant above ground biomass canopy coverage and leaf area index increased firstly and reached the maximum in august then decreased gradually nevertheless fluctuated increasing trends were found in plant litter density and root mass density overall ck had the maximum agb ld and rmd cl had the maximum pc and lai whereas as had the minimum pc agb ld and lai table 1 in addition rmd decreased rapidly with soil depth within surface soil layer 0 40 cm then decreased gradually within the deeper soil layer 40 120 cm fig 3 g these differences in soil and vegetation properties as well as their temporal variation and vertical distribution are hypothesized to influence the response of soil moisture to precipitation and contribute to the differences in soil water storage between different plant communities 3 2 response of soil moisture to precipitation and plant communities at event scale the response of soil moisture to precipitation at event scale was reflected by the change in soil moisture δ s m and lag time in this study δ s m was defined as the difference between the maximum soil moisture after precipitation and the initial soil moisture at the beginning of precipitation the lag time was the time from the beginning of precipitation to the point of soil moisture starting to increase triggered by precipitation the results showed that the response of soil moisture to precipitation was greatly influenced by rainfall type overall δ s m increased with precipitation amount under different plant communities but it was not true for all cases fig 5 for instance δ s m of as for soil depth of 10 cm was only 0 5 under heavy rain which was significantly lower than that under light rain 4 1 and moderate rain 4 9 compared to bare land the mean δ s m of top 10 cm soil layer of grass community decreased by 41 2 50 7 49 0 and 3 7 under light rain moderate rain heavy rain and rainstorm whereas for shrub community δ s m decreased by 20 6 and 46 7 under light rain and moderate rain but increased by 77 6 and 19 1 under heavy rain and rainstorm for the lag time it increased with soil depth moreover the lag times of steep gully slopes covered by different plant communities were longer than that of bare land under light rain moderate rain and heavy rain whereas was almost the same in the rainstorm fig 5 furthermore the differences in the lag time between different plant communities decreased with precipitation amount and intensity in other word the influences of plant community on the lag time reduced with precipitation amount and intensity however no significant trend was detected between different rainfall types for precipitation events with similar amount approximately 20 mm the response of soil moisture to precipitation also varied greatly with months during one growing season fig 6 in this study the differences in response effect to precipitation events between different months were analyzed for three sites they were bare land bl shrub community of ck and grass community of ag the results showed that shrub community of ck had the maximum δ s m in these three months which were 13 6 9 6 and 7 2 from june to august then followed by bare land bl and grass community of ag which were 10 3 5 4 7 1 and 6 2 2 3 5 4 respectively fig 6 moreover the largest δ s m within top soil layer 10 cm were found in june whereas the smallest ones of bl and ag were detected in july and that of ck was in august fig 6 for the lag time shrub community of ck had the shortest lag times in these three months whereas grass communities of ag had the longest ones fig 6 the longest lag times of the selected three sites were found in july whereas that of the shortest were detected in august fig 6 since the response of soil moisture to precipitation was obvious within 10 cm and 30 cm soil layers thus the main influencing factors were also analyzed in these two soil layers the results of path analysis indicated that δ s m and the lag time were jointly affected by precipitation properties vegetation and soil properties and topography parameters figs 7 and 8 for top 10 cm soil layer δ s m was dominantly affected by i 5 iwc lai and ld it increased with i 5 and ld whereas decreased with iwc and lai with the path coefficients of 0 92 0 02 0 66 and 0 21 respectively for 30 cm soil layer δ s m was mainly affected by pa mpi iwc and ld it increased with pa mpi and ld whereas declined with iwc with the path coefficients of 2 69 2 75 0 53 and 2 55 respectively the lag time of top 10 cm soil layer was dominantly controlled by pa mpi iwc and ld it decreased with pa and mpi whereas increased with iwc and ld with the path coefficients of 0 67 0 61 0 61 and 0 43 whereas the lag time of 30 cm soil layer was mainly influenced by pd slope gradient and fc the lag time reduced with pd and slope gradient whereas it increased with fc with the path coefficients of 0 30 0 46 and 0 16 3 3 response of soil moisture to precipitation and plant communities at monthly scale soil moisture exhibited a similar trend for all sites during one year at monthly scale fig 9 soil moisture of surface soil layer 0 40 cm for hr and 0 100 cm for other six plant communities decreased gradually from january to approximately june then increased sharply to about september and finally decreased gradually to december overall soil moisture of shallow soil layer 0 100 cm fluctuated greatly over time whereas it was relatively stable within deep soil layer 100 200 cm only increased under extreme rainstorms or series of consecutive precipitations such as august 2020 all above mentioned results indicated that precipitation could generally replenish soil water above 100 cm layer whereas for deep soil layer it could only be replenished under extreme rainstorms or series of consecutive precipitations on steep gully slope the vertical distribution of soil moisture across the profile was different between different plant communities fig 10 a with the increase of soil depth soil moisture increased firstly and then decreased for plant communities of bl hr ag and bi but for other three plant communities soil moisture exhibited a complex trend of decrease increase decrease nevertheless the maximum soil moisture was detected within soil layer from 60 cm to 100 cm for all plant communities fig 10 a additionally the coefficients of variation of soil moisture decreased gradually with the increase of soil depth fig 10 b which confirmed again that soil moisture became more stable with the increase of soil depth however the coefficients of variation of soil moisture in the deepest soil layer 160 cm could be greater than that of the upper soil layer triggered by extreme rainstorm replenishment fig 10 c 3 4 response of soil water storage to precipitation and plant communities at annual scale no significant difference was found in soil water storage sws between different years whereas it varied greatly between different plant communities fig 11 since sws of hr was calculated from only 0 80 cm soil layer whereas for other six plant communities sws were computed from 0 200 cm soil layer thus sws of hr was not included in the following analysis the results demonstrated that cl had the maximum sws followed by bi as bl ag and ck which were 452 88 417 32 392 96 347 52 346 93 and 193 55 mm respectively compared to bl the mean sws of shrub community decreased by 44 3 whereas that of grass community increased by 15 8 the results of multiple stepwise regression analysis indicated that the differences in sws between different plant communities were dominantly controlled by plant above ground biomass soil field capacity and land surface roughness which explained approximately 99 5 of the total difference table 4 moreover no significant correlations were found between agb fc and lsr table 5 thus the effects of their interactions could be negligible consequently agb played the most important role in the differences in sws between different plant communities with the relative contribution of 71 6 then followed by fc and lsr with the relative contributions of 22 1 and 5 8 table 4 4 discussions 4 1 response of soil moisture to precipitation and plant communities at event scale the response of soil moisture to precipitation differed greatly between different rainfall types and occurred months figs 5 and 6 which were closely related to precipitation properties vegetation and soil properties and topography parameters figs 7 and 8 overall the change in soil moisture δ s m increased with precipitation amount and intensity fig 7 this result is in accordance with the results of some previous studies albertson and kiely 2001 he et al 2012 heisler white et al 2008 who found that precipitation with small amount and low intensity was easy to lose via canopy and litter interception he et al 2012 the δ s m of as within top 10 cm soil layer under heavy rain was smaller than that under light and moderate rains fig 5 which was induced by the high initial water content before heavy rain in the studied region soil infiltration is a typical process of intensity excess soil with high initial soil moisture will decrease the suction gradient between wet and dry soil layers reduces soil infiltration and is prone to generate runoff wei et al 2007 zhang et al 2019b zhu et al 2014 as a result δ s m decreased with iwc fig 7 the decrease in δ s m with lai was induced by the processes of interception and transpiration it is well known that plant with high lai consumes more precipitation and soil moisture via interception and transpiration duan et al 2016 the result of δ s m increased with plant litter density was inconsistent with the conclusion of sharafatmandrad et al 2010 who reported that plant litter could decrease δ s m via intercepting precipitation this difference was closely related to whether runoff generated or not generally before runoff generates plant litter decreases precipitation via interception he et al 2012 thereby reducing the change in soil moisture however once runoff generated the undecomposed litter covered on soil surface could increase land surface roughness and promote infiltration via slowing down runoff and increasing its residence time pannkuk and robichaud 2003 wang et al 2020b zhu et al 2020a moreover the decomposed plant litter which had been incorporated into top soil layer could also improve soil structure via protecting surface soil from consolidation thereby promoting infiltration properties as well as increasing soil moisture indirectly zhu et al 2020a therefore δ s m of shrub communities under light rain and moderate rain were lower than that of bare land whereas that under heavy rain and rainstorm were greater than that of bare land since runoff generated for ck however δ s m of grass communities under all rainfall types were lower than that of bare land this result was attributed to the comprehensive effects of plant canopy litter and biological soil crust except for the interception of plant canopy and litter biological soil crust also prevented water from infiltration thus decreased the change in soil moisture chamizo et al 2013 wang et al 2017b in this study cyanobacterial crusts developed in grass communities which can form a relatively non porous layer when they are wetted chamizo et al 2012 wang et al 2017b and further prevents surface runoff from infiltration and decreases δ s m directly furthermore induced by the low value of agb pc lai and iwc among three tested months figs 4 and 6 δ s m of june was the largest for the lag time it decreased with precipitation amount duration and intensity fig 8 as mentioned above precipitation with small amount and low intensity was easy to lose via canopy and litter interception he et al 2012 which increased the lag time the positive effect of iwc and ld on the lag time within 10 cm top soil layer was induced by low infiltration and high runoff rate of soils with high initial water content zhang et al 2019b and soil surface covered by more plant litter could intercept more precipitation before it infiltrated into soil sharafatmandrad et al 2010 the lag time decreased with slope gradient at soil depth of 30 cm was confirmed by some previous studies who concluded that soil infiltration rate increased with slope gradient janeau et al 2003 morbidelli et al 2018 the reason was probably that runoff velocity and soil erosion increased with slope gradient which wrecked soil physical crust and produced great land surface roughness thereby increasing infiltration rate janeau et al 2003 zhu et al 2020b moreover the lag time increased with field capacity was easy to understand that soils with high field capacity had great potential to store water robertson et al 2021 nevertheless despite of the fact that the selected precipitation events in july had the maximum precipitation intensity whereas the lag time was the longest which is not consistent with the results of some previous studies this result was likely triggered by the process of soil consolidation the intensity of the selected precipitation event in july was far greater than those selected in june and august table 3 which was prone to breakdown soil aggregate via raindrop to form soil crust wang et al 2016 zhang and xie 2019 as a result soil surface permeability decreased significantly and the lag time increased robinson and woodun 2008 thus we speculated that there was a threshold existing in precipitation intensity to form soil crust and further to prevent infiltration process and affect soil moisture when the precipitation intensity was less than the threshold infiltration rate and the lag time of soil moisture increased with precipitation intensity whereas when it was greater than the threshold they decreased with precipitation intensity however the speculated threshold was unclear in this study and further studies are needed in future to investigate it 4 2 response of soil moisture to precipitation and plant communities at monthly scale the temporal variation in soil moisture was closely related to soil water consumption and replenishment since both precipitation and vegetation properties varied greatly during one year figs 2 and 4 in this study soil moisture of shallow 0 100 cm soil layer changed over time with a pattern of decreasing january to june increasing july to september and decreasing october to december fig 9 the decreasing trend from january to approximately june and october to december was induced by soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration shao et al 2021 whereas the increasing trend from july to september was attributed to the concentrated precipitation on the loess plateau cheng et al 2020 though vegetation consumed a lot of soil water from july to september due to the great agb pc lai and rmd fig 4 soil moisture still increased significantly fig 9 which was also induced by the greatly concentrated precipitation within one year soil moisture was positively correlated with precipitation at monthly scale and the significant positive relationships were found at 10 and 30 cm soil layers for most sites moreover the correlation coefficients decreased with the increase of soil depth table 6 this result again confirmed that precipitation played a more significant role in increasing soil moisture in semi arid regions i e the loess plateau cheng et al 2020 wang et al 2017a and its influence decreased with the increase of soil depth in addition two obvious periods with low soil moisture were found from january to february and from may to june for surface soil layer 0 40 cm fig 9 the former was caused by the processes of freezing and thawing flerchinger et al 2006 since the air temperature at that time was lower than 0 fig 2 the latter was induced by the increasing consumption of soil water due to the beginning growth of vegetation cheng et al 2020 which was confirmed by the sharply increases in agb pc lai and rmd fig 3 and little precipitation occurred during these two months fig 2 furthermore soil moisture increased significantly across soil profile in august 2020 for all sites fig 9 which was triggered by consecutive precipitation events with short interval fig 2 the cumulative amount of precipitation produced a superimposition effect he et al 2012 increased soil moisture across the whole profile the vertical distribution of soil moisture was greatly influenced by the vertical distribution of plant roots dang et al 2020 sahaar and niemann 2020 su and shangguan 2018 in this study soil moisture fluctuated greatly within shallow soil layer 0 100 cm whereas it was almost stable within deep soil layer figs 9 and 10 b this result agrees with the results of some previous studies cheng et al 2020 dang et al 2020 wang et al 2017a on the loess plateau precipitation generally replenished soil water for shallow soil layer 0 100 cm figs 5 and 6 soil water consumption induced by vegetation growth was mainly from soil layer above 40 cm and hardly deeper than 100 cm except for ck wang et al 2010 due to the vertical distribution of plant root systems fig 3 g this was also the reason why the maximum soil moisture of all sites appeared within the soil layer from 60 cm to 100 cm at annual scale fig 9 4 3 response of soil water storage to precipitation and plant communities at annual scale for long time scale soil moisture was dominantly controlled by precipitation amount wang et al 2017a in this study precipitation in 2020 508 6 mm was slightly greater than that in 2019 485 8 mm thus soil water storage of most plant communities in 2020 was also slightly greater than those in 2019 except for as and cl fig 11 however sws varied greatly between different plant communities which is consistent with the results of some previous studies wang et al 2013 2017a zhao et al 2017 generally sws declines gradually with vegetation restoration jia et al 2017 su and shangguan 2018 and the reduction increased with above ground biomass plant canopy coverage leaf area index and root mass density aijm and keenan 2007 duan et al 2016 jian et al 2015 zhu et al 2014 in this study ck had the maximum agb pc and rmd and as had the minimum ones table 1 fig 4 as a result ck had the minimum sws whereas cl had the maximum sws but not as fig 11 the reason is that cl locates at a north facing slope with low elevation and nearby the gully channel and a greater sws was expected moreover sws of bi was also greater than that of as this result was attributed to the fact that bi had a fibrous root system and a soil with high clay content plants with fibrous root systems consume less water dang et al 2020 zhao et al 2017 soils with high clay content generally have a large specific surface area thereby a strong water retaining capacity and soil water is hard to evaporate and drain li et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b some previous studies concluded that no significant difference was found in soil moisture between hillslope and steep gully slope under different land use types gao et al 2016 yu et al 2018 in this study compared to the results of hillslope reported by xiao et al 2016 in the same watershed soil water storage 0 200 cm soil layer of hillslope 394 09 mm basically equaled to that of steep gully slope 392 96 mm for as whereas for ck sws of hillslope 252 05 mm was significantly greater than that of steep gully slope 193 55 mm this difference confirmed again that the replenishment of rainfall to soil moisture was less than soil moisture consumed by ck zhao et al 2017 as a result sm declined with the growth age of ck our measurement was 9 years later than their study xiao et al 2016 and low sws was expected it also indicated indirectly that vegetation restoration via planting ck has huge risk to form dry soil layer on steep gully slopes due to the continuous decrease of soil moisture nevertheless except for ag sws of other three grass communities were greater than that of bare land fig 11 this result differed from the results of previous studies wang et al 2013 2017a zhao et al 2017 this difference could be explained by that bare land locates above the gully sidewall and biological soil crust developed in most grass communities firstly due to the development of gully slope length was shortened greatly which certainly reduced surface runoff infiltration wang et al 2020a secondly influenced by gravity the infiltrated water would decline rapidly via drainage during and after precipitation events melliger and niemann 2010 thirdly soil evaporation and growth of vegetation on the gully sidewall also likely reduced soil moisture significantly wang et al 2020a zheng et al 2006 fourthly as mentioned above the development of cyanobacterial crusts in grass communities can form a relatively non porous layer chamizo et al 2012 wang et al 2017b which can slow down the loss of soil moisture from evaporation chamizo et al 2013 and likely result in greater soil moisture of grass communities than that of bare land 4 4 implications for vegetation management on steep slope vegetation restoration on steep gully slope is of significant importance since it is the main sediment source in a small watershed of the loess hilly gully region zhang et al 2019a nevertheless large scale of inappropriate vegetation restoration has led to series of environmental problems i e the formation of dried soil layer and reduction of river flow discharge which may drastically change the hydrological cycle processes and greatly restrict the regional sustainability development ye et al 2019 moreover some studies reported that the thickness of dried soil layer on steep gully slope was greater than that on hillslope zhang et al 2021 zhang and huang 2021 therefore vegetation restoration and its proper management are extremely urgent on steep gully slopes in the arid and semi arid regions the results of the current study demonstrated that the differences in soil water storage between different plant communities were dominantly controlled by above ground biomass with a relative contribution of 71 6 table 4 however precipitation can hardly replenish soil water for soil layer deeper than 200 cm even 100 cm consequently from the aspects of soil water content and its storage plant communities with high above ground biomass and deep rooted systems i e robinia pseudoacacia caragana korshinskii and medicago sativa are not recommended during re vegetation on steep gully slopes in semi arid regions 5 conclusions this study was performed to investigate the response of soil moisture to precipitation properties on steep gully slopes under different plant communities based on the consecutive monitor of soil moisture from may 2019 to october 2020 due to the comprehensive effects of precipitation initial water content soil and vegetation properties and topography the response of soil moisture to precipitation varied greatly between different rainfall types and months the change in soil moisture of top 10 cm soil layer increased with i 5 and ld whereas it decreased with iwc and lai for top 30 cm soil layer δ s m increased with pa mpi and ld and decreased with iwc the lag time of top 10 cm soil layer decreased with pa and mpi and increased with iwc and ld but for top 30 cm soil layer it decreased with pd and slope gradient and increased with fc due to the joint influences of evapotranspiration and precipitation replenishment soil moisture fluctuated greatly during one year for shallow 0 100 cm soil layer with a pattern of decreasing january to june increasing july to september and decreasing october to december soil moisture of deep soil layer 100 cm was almost stable and could only be replenished under extreme rainstorm or series of consecutive precipitations furthermore due to the similar precipitation amount no significant difference was detected in soil water storage between the year of 2019 and 2020 but varied greatly between different plant communities the variations in sws between different plant communities were dominantly attributed to the differences in agb fc and lsr which explained approximately 99 5 of the differences compared to bare land sws of shrub community decreased by 44 3 whereas that of grass community increased by 15 8 therefore to maintain the sustainability of vegetation restoration grass communities with shallow roots and low above ground biomass are suggested for re vegetation on steep gully slopes in arid and semi arid regions declaration of competing interest the authors
