15385,greenhouse gas ghg emissions from small inland waters are disproportionately large climate warming is expected to favor dominance of algae and free floating plants at the expense of submerged plants through different routes these functional plant types may have far reaching impacts on freshwater ghg emissions in future warmer waters which are yet unknown we conducted a 1 000 l mesocosm experiment testing the effects of plant type and warming on ghg emissions from temperate inland waters dominated by either algae free floating or submerged plants in controls and warmed 4 c treatments for one year each our results show that the effect of experimental warming on ghg fluxes differs between dominance of different functional plant types mainly by modulating methane ebullition an often dominant ghg emission pathway specifically we demonstrate that the response to experimental warming was strongest for free floating and lowest for submerged plant dominated systems importantly our results suggest that anticipated shifts in plant type from submerged plants to a dominance of algae or free floating plants with warming may increase total ghg emissions from shallow waters this together with a warming induced emission response represents a so far overlooked positive climate feedback management strategies aimed at favouring submerged plant dominance may thus substantially mitigate ghg emissions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords greenhouse gas emission climate warming methane carbon dioxide ebullition alternative states data availability the data that support the findings of this study are archived in the dans easy repository https doi org 10 17026 dans zqj dyrc 1 introduction shallow freshwater ecosystems typically represent a specific ecological state characterized by the dominance of different functional plant types submerged plants phytoplankton or free floating plants scheffer and carpenter 2003 scheffer and van nes 2007 shifts between these ecological states can occur rather sudden for instance due to storms or water level changes see scheffer 1998 these so called alternative states affect primary production biogeochemical processes and important ecosystem services carpenter and lodge 1986 de tezanos pinto and o farrell 2014 hilt et al 2017 janssen et al 2021 while blooms of all primary producers can lead to anoxia under eutrophic conditions e g istvánovics 2009 in mesotrophic conditions dominance by free floating plants such as lemna for instance typically leads to much lower oxygen concentrations in the water and sediment as compared to submerged plant and algae dominated states netten et al 2010 this is mainly due to decreased phytoplankton photosynthesis below the shading plant canopy decreased diffusion of oxygen through the plant mats and decaying plant matter resulting in high sediment oxygen demand de tezanos pinto and o farrell 2014 these low oxygen conditions potentially promote methane ch4 emission shifts in dominance of different types of plants may therefore have far reaching implications for freshwater greenhouse gas ghg emissions hilt et al 2017 li et al 2021 comparisons of ghg carbon dioxide co2 ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions between distinct alternative states have so far been based on a limited number of field observations and have been complicated by a range of confounding factors such as a lack of standardized methods and the omission of certain ghgs as well as their relevant emission pathways such as ch4 ebullition bubble flux of ch4 from sediments hilt et al 2017 li et al 2021 hence it remains unclear how shifts in plant dominance will affect ghg emissions based on the increase of individual metabolic rates it is expected that higher temperatures will disproportionally increase ecosystem respiration relative to gross primary production allen et al 2005 yvon durocher et al 2010 which may lead to a reduced net co2 uptake while some studies confirm this effect of warming yvon durocher et al 2017 others do not find such an effect davidson et al 2015 or even find a lower net co2 efflux with warming davidson et al 2015 these contrasting results may be due to differences in the availability of growth limiting resources e g nitrogen and phosphorus food web structure as well as indirect effects of temperature the latter includes effects of temperature on the abundance growth strategies and key traits of the plants and microorganisms present which may override the effects of temperature on the metabolic rates at the subcellular and individual level davidson et al 2015 dossena et al 2012 hood et al 2018 kraemer et al 2017 similarly effects of temperature on ch4 emission are ambiguous although ch4 production by methanogenic archaea mainly in sediments tends to be temperature dependent when sufficient substrate is available fuchs et al 2016 marotta et al 2014 not all ch4 reaches the atmosphere as part of it is subject to microbial oxidation of ch4 mainly in the sediment water interface and water column bastviken et al 2009 a process which is also temperature dependent fuchs et al 2016 lofton et al 2014 shelley et al 2015 differential temperature effects on ch4 production and ch4 oxidation fuchs et al 2016 lofton et al 2014 shelley et al 2015 as well as warming induced shifts in the microbial community zhu et al 2020 may explain the differential effects of warming on diffusive ch4 emissions reported in the literature varying from positive effects to the absence of effects aben et al 2017 davidson et al 2015 yvon durocher et al 2014 zhu et al 2020 the effect of warming on ch4 ebullition however seems unambiguous as reports so far indicate a strong increase with warming provided that substrates for ch4 production are not limiting aben et al 2017 davidson et al 2018 delsontro et al 2016 ch4 ebullition largely bypasses microbial ch4 oxidation and is often found to be the dominant ghg emission pathway in inland waters bastviken et al 2009 despite this ebullition is often not measured or only measured at short time intervals minutes to hours which likely results in an underestimation of this strongly episodic flux hilt et al 2017 saunois et al 2016 wik et al 2016 to date however most ebullition measurements have been conducted at unvegetated sites e g aben et al 2017 furthermore ebullition data recorded over a considerable temperature range are rare for systems dominated by submerged plants but see davidson et al 2018 and even more so for systems dominated by free floating plants possibly due to methodological difficulties see methods yet these functional plant types can strongly modify ch4 production consumption and transportation see bodmer et al 2021 for an overview of the different processes thereby likely leading to a differential temperature effect on ch4 ebullition under contrasting ecosystem states however although climate warming can increase the chances of shifts from dominance by submerged plants to dominance by free floating plants or algae mooij et al 2007 netten et al 2011 peeters et al 2013 not much is known about the consequences of these shifts for ghg emissions in general hilt et al 2017 and ebullition in particular the question therefore remains how dominance of different functional plant types in shallow lakes and ponds will affect ghg emissions and the impact of climate warming on these emissions to answer this fundamental question we used indoor 1000 liter experimental ponds containing natural lake sediments and overlaying water and experimentally tested in three consecutive years how warming 4 c n 4 affected year round ghg emissions in the temperate climate zone under dominance of different functional plant types dominance by submerged plants myriophyllum spicatum free floating plants lemna minor spirodela polyrhiza or algae we measured emissions of all important ghgs i e co2 ch4 and n2o and the contributions of their relevant emission pathways 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiment was conducted in eight cylindrical stainless steel indoor mesocosms called limnotrons with a volume of 988 l a depth of 1 34 m and a diameter of 0 97 m area 0 74 m² situated at the netherlands institute of ecology see verschoor et al 2003 for details for this study limnotrons were set up to mimic shallow temperate latitude ponds and lakes with moderate nutrient concentrations systems where alternative states are possible scheffer and van nes 2007 starting in 2014 three states with dominance of different types of plants were studied consecutively each for a full year an algae submerged plant and free floating plant dominated state temperature treatments consisted of a control n 4 with seasonally varying water temperatures typical for dutch lakes fig 2 and a warm 4 c treatment consistent with predicted warming by the end of the 21st century in north and central europe under intermediate anthropogenic ghg emissions scenario rcp6 0 ipcc 2013 both temperature treatments included a five day midsummer heat wave 4 c as heat waves are expected to occur more often in the future ipcc 2013 as we do not have a control for the heat wave we refrain from speculating about its effects the light dark cycle followed dutch seasonality with 17 h of daylight in midsummer and 8 h of daylight in midwinter the limnotrons were emptied and cleaned for each state soft muddy sediment was collected from a nearby mesotrophic pond 51 59 16 0 n 5 40 06 1 e sieved over a 5 mm mesh and homogenized by thorough manual mixing before adding it to the limnotrons approximately 75 l of sediment was added to each limnotron two weeks before the start of the experiment of each plant type sediment organic c and c n ratios table 1 were similar to those of shallow lakes and ponds with a similar trophic state gilbert et al 2021 marotta et al 2014 to maintain sediment characteristics as similar as possible for the different states while also mimicking approximate sediment conditions that correspond to the different functional plant types dominating the system we used sediment from the above mentioned pond for all three states for the submerged plant state we mixed sediment collected the year before with fresh sediment 1 to 2 parts v v to ensure the presence of fresh organic matter for the free floating plants state freshly collected sediment from the pond was mixed with sediment from the previous state 1 to 14 parts v v duckweed dominance is stabilized by the presence of propagules in the sediment boedeltje et al 2005 hence we subsequently spiked 1 to 28 parts v v the systems with sediment from a nearby duckweed dominated ditch 51 59 43 3 n 5 38 38 7 e after the introduction of the sediment the limnotrons were filled to the top with tap water water was circulated manually between all limnotrons for 2 days to ensure homogeneous starting conditions an aquarium pump eheim compact 300 eheim gmbh co kg deizisau germany and two compact axial fans ac axial compact fan 4850 z ebm papst st georgen gmbh co kg georgen germany with an air flow of 100 m3 h 1 were installed above each limnotron to promote a gas exchange velocity typical of small lakes and ponds see supplementary methods for details lastly limnotrons were spiked with nutrients and the different types of plants were introduced at densities typical for the respective state see below for details limnotrons were left to establish for ca 2 weeks prior to experimental warming at temperatures of ca 5 control and 8 warmed c throughout the experiment limnotrons were gently refilled with demineralized water once or twice per week to compensate for evaporative losses 2 2 plant characteristics for the algae dominated state limnotrons were inoculated with a phytoplankton community from the same mesotrophic pond where the sediment was collected and an additional 15 inoculum from a nearby eutrophic pond 51 59 16 3 n 5 40 06 0 e on 15 february 2014 this resulted in an initial biomass of 2 2 0 4 g c m 2 table 1 typical for temperate mesotrophic freshwater bodies in spring e g nixdorf and arndt 1993 for the submerged plant dominated state the species myriophyllum spicatum eurasian watermilfoil was used as this plant is a common native or naturalized species in most temperate climate regions grin database https www ars grin gov npgs verified 23 january 2018 plants with a median length of about 80 cm including roots were collected from the pond the sediment originated from in march 2016 and carefully washed to remove macroinvertebrates and their eggs we introduced five plants to each mesocosm by tying a pebble just above their roots to sink them to the sediment due to limited initial growth four and six additional plants were added to each limnotron in the same way at seven and sixteen weeks after the start of the experiment respectively this resulted in a plant density of 20 per m² and a total initial biomass of 9 8 3 0 g c m 2 table 1 11 31 g dry weight m 2 approximately 140 g fresh weight fw per limnotron pvi 1 which represents a typical spring situation in temperate m spicatum stands e g tóth and herodek 2011 biomass of added submerged macrophytes was estimated using photographs of the plants added to each limnotron and converting the plant surface area on the photo to a dry weight biomass as explained in fig s1 for the free floating plant dominated state a community of duckweed species mainly lemna minor spirodela polyrhiza was collected on 19 april 2016 from an agricultural ditch in ysselsteyn the netherlands and introduced to the limnotrons the mentioned duckweed species are native and common free floating plants in most temperate climate regions hussner 2012 grin database https www ars grin gov npgs verified 23 january 2018 directly after collecting the duckweed was carefully sieved mesh size 0 85 mm and washed to remove litter as well as macroinvertebrates and their eggs we then introduced 500 g fw of duckweed to each limnotron which resulted in 100 surface cover which is typical for temperate waterbodies dominated by duckweed e g kazanjian et al 2018a throughout the year the community was dominated by lemna minor and spirodela polyrhiza the cold water at the start of the experiment combined with the thin plant mat likely delayed the onset of low oxygen conditions and related nutrient release de tezanos pinto and o farrell 2014 thereby hampering duckweed growth to overcome this growth constraint and to hasten the development of hypoxic conditions we added extra biomass 600 g fw to each limnotron on day of year doy 29 during the second half of the experiment we experienced a large die off of free floating plants due to infection by cataclysta lemnata larvae also known to occur in systems outdoors e g arts et al 2001 to compensate for this we re introduced biomass 400 g fw to each limnotron on doy 211 total c added to each limnotron via biomass introduction was 35 0 0 1 g c m 2 table 1 throughout the experiment duckweed covered on average 90 63 100 of the surface in the control and 94 50 100 in the

light sensor li cor environmental gmbh bad homburg germany for each limnotron light was provided by two hps ms lamps cdm tp elite mw 315 400 w agrilight b v resulting in a constant incident light intensity of 160 40 par mean s d µmol photons m 2 s 1 limnotrons were spiked with nutrients at the start of each experiment to reach start concentrations of 4 2 0 8 0 2 0 1 and 4 3 1 0 mg l 1 of no3 po4 3 and si respectively these concentrations both fall within the overlapping ranges of a mesotrophic and eutrophic state according to the quantitative lake classification tables of vollenweider and kerekes 1980 we chose these concentrations as they allow for phytoplankton submerged macrophyte as well as floating plant dominance minor nutrient losses through sampling were recorded and compensated for by weekly nutrient additions to determine concentrations of dissolved nutrients in the surface water 10 ml of water sample was filtered over a prewashed 100 ml distilled water glass microfiber filter whatman gf f maidstone uk and stored at 20 c until analysis prior to analysis samples were slowly thawed at 5 c concentrations of ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 3 were measured on a

rhizosphere research products wageningen the netherlands installed in the upper 10 cm of the sediment the first 10 ml was discarded to enable anaerobic sampling samples were stored at 20 c until further analysis pore water concentrations of po4 3 no3 and nh4 were measured colorimetrically with an auto analyzer 3 system bran luebbe norderstedt germany using ammonium molybdate henriksen 1965 hydrazine sulfate kamphake et al 1967 and salicylate grasshoff and johannsen 1972 respectively total inorganic nitrogen n was determined by summing the ammonium nh4 and nitrate no3 concentrations dried plant biomass was ground to a fine powder on a microfine grinder mf 10 basic ikawerke staufen germany c and n content was analyzed on a flash 2000 nc elemental analyzer brechbuehler incorporated interscience b v breda the netherlands phosphorus content was determined by combustion of plant biomass in a pyrex glass tube at 550 c for 30 min murphy and riley 1962 subsequently 5 ml of persulfate 2 5 was added and samples were autoclaved for 30 min at 121 c digested p as orthophosphate was measured colorimetrically on a quaatro39 auto analyzer seal analytical ltd southampton uk 2 4 ebullitive fluxes throughout the experiment ch4 release via ebullition was determined by continuous collection of gas bubbles from the sediment using custom made bubble traps bubble traps consist of an inverted funnel id 15 2 cm connected to a water filled glass container via an 80 cm long tube id 10 mm each limnotron contained two bubble traps with funnels being approximately 50 cm under the water surface gas filled glass containers were collected and immediately replaced by new ones a total of 10 13 and 13 times during the submerged plant free floating plant and algae dominated states respectively always before being completely filled with gas the deployment time of glass containers before being replaced depended on the ebullition rate and ranged from 11 to 89 median 25 7 to 64 median 18 and 8 to 65 median 21 days in the submerged plant free floating plant and algae dominated states respectively after collection the volume of gas was determined by subtracting the weight of each bottle from the pre determined full filled weight i e bottle completely filled with water ch4 concentrations in the gas were measured on an hp 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a porapak q column 80 100 mesh and a flame ionization detector hewlett packard palo alto ca usa the amount of gaseous ch4 in each bottle was determined by multiplying the ch4 concentration c gas by the volume of gas v gas the ch4 in the bottles was assumed to be in equilibrium with the water phase hence the amount of ch4 dissolved in the water c water v water was calculated using henry s law and its solubility constant for ch4 taking the respective water temperature into account sander 2015 the total amount of ch4 in each bottle was calculated by summing the aqueous and gaseous content and divided by funnel surface a and time δt to calculate ch4 ebullition per square meter eq 1 1 n c h 4 c gas v gas c water v water δ t a the ch4 content of collected ebullitive gas was on average 45 0 91 76 0 99 and 57 0 95 min max for the submerged plant free floating plant and algae dominated states respectively gas volume in glass containers was checked on several occasions before and after diffusive flux measurements to assess whether measurements triggered bubble release we observed no effect prior to the harvest of submerged plants random plant stems were broken and evolving gas bubbles were captured by enclosing the stem with inverted water filled 12 ml gas tight vials exetainer labco lampeter uk subsequently ch4 concentrations of captured gas were determined as described above estimating ch4 ebullition in free floating plant dominated systems is not straightforward as part of the evolved bubbles are trapped under dense free floating plant mats based on plant cover and the empirical relationship reported in kosten et al 2016 we assumed that in our systems 20 of measured ebullition was trapped we therefore reduced the ebullitive flux measured below the free floating plants with 20 to get an estimate of the ebullitive emission to the atmosphere ch4 from trapped bubbles may partially dissolve and can be consumed by microbes in the aerobic rhizosphere of the free floating plants kosten et al 2016 2 5 diffusive greenhouse gas fluxes diffusive fluxes of ch4 and co2 were measured using an acrylic cylindrical transparent chamber id 29 2 cm connected in a closed loop to a greenhouse gas analyser gga during the first six months of the algae dominated state ch4 concentrations were measured using off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy gga model gga 24r ep los gatos research while co2 concentrations were determined from ph temperature and dissolved inorganic carbon measurements see following paragraph all measurements of n2o ch4 and co2 thereafter were conducted using a wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy gga model g2508 picarro both devices measured at 1 hz intervals and yielded similar results in a post experiment comparative test ensuring no analyser related bias measurements of 3 5 min were performed in triplicate and were repeated when influenced by ebullition evidenced as an abrupt concentration increase in between measurements the chamber was ventilated with ambient air diffusive fluxes were typically measured every 2 4 weeks dominance by submerged and free floating plants and every 2 weeks dominance by algae during the pre heat wave period and every 4 5 weeks during the post heat wave period in all cases additional measurements were performed in the week before during and after the heat wave the slope of the relationship between gas concentration and time was used to calculate fluxes delsontro et al 2016 eq 2 2 f v a slope p f 1 f 2 r t where f is the gas flux g m 2 d 1 v is chamber headspace volume m3 measured during the measurement and a is chamber surface area m2 slope is the slope of the relationship between the ghg concentration and the time ppm second 1 p is atmospheric pressure pa f1 is the molar mass of the respective ghgs co2 44 01 n2o 44 01 or ch4 16 04 g mol 1 f2 is the conversion factor of seconds to days r is the ideal gas constant 8 3145 m3 pa k 1 mol 1 t is the water temperature k in the free floating plant dominated state deployment of the floating chamber during warm periods with high ebullition led to an initial peak in ch4 concentration even in replicate measurements followed by a strong linear increase over the following minutes only the latter was used to calculate the diffusive flux both the initial peak as well as the large magnitude of the diffusive flux are likely caused by the release of ch4 from trapped bubbles under the plant mats as described above although part of this gaseous ch4 may have diffused to the atmosphere also without the disturbance of the floating chamber deployment we subtracted the fraction of ebullition estimated to be retained under the plant mats described above from the measured diffusive flux we argue that we hereby obtained a conservative estimate of the diffusive ch4 flux as under natural conditions wind and animals e g birds fish can displace floating plant mats which would further enhance ch4 emissions to the atmosphere diffusive fluxes were always measured at the end of the day as well as at the end of the night period to capture expected minimum and maximum fluxes of co2 respectively mean diel fluxes of ch4 and co2 were calculated as a weighted average of the light and dark period fluxes based on day and nighttime length limnotrons were always measured in random order to avoid potential bias by time or order related effects a leakage test was performed on each measurement day to ensure no leakage was present in the closed loop system to this end the chamber base was sealed to a flat surface using terostat ix teroson the opening at the top of the chamber was then closed with a cap containing a septum through which methane was injected a ch4 concentration of approximately 15 ppm was then used to check for leakages over a 20 30 min period no leakages were detected throughout the experiment we observed no emission of n2o except for day 196 of the experiment where n2o emission was observed in a control mesocosm of the algae dominated state 4 8 mg n2o m 2 d 1 hence n2o emission was of trivial importance for the overall ghg emissions and therefore not included in our analyses 2 6 calculated co2 water atmosphere fluxes though the majority of diffusive co2 fluxes were measured using a gga as discussed above this was not possible during the first six months of the experiment with algae as the dominant primary producer due to a malfunctioning co2 sensor in the los gatos gga during this period we determined co2 fluxes as follows eq 3 3 f k c sur c eq where f is the flux mg co2 m 2 d 1 k is the piston velocity m d 1 and c sur and c eq are surface water and air equilibrium co2 concentrations mg co2 m 3 cole et al 2010 respectively piston velocity as ko2 was empirically determined at temperatures of 8 5 16 5 and 24 5 c in an additional limnotron that did not contain sediment using deoxygenated water after tribe et al 1995 the data of these experiments can be found in fig s2 standardizing these k measurements by respective schmidt numbers and an exponent n of 0 67 for low wind systems cole et al 2010 wanninkhof 2014 resulted in a k 600 of 0 43 0 03 m d 1 mean s d fig s3 which is typical for small lakes and ponds holgerson and raymond 2016 c sur was calculated from measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon dic ph temperature and dissociation constants of carbonic acid in pure water millero et al 2006 according to the equations in table 4 2 of stumm and morgan 1996 c eq was calculated using henry s law and its solubility constant for co2 after sander 2015 taking the respective water temperatures into account and assuming an atmospheric co2 fraction of 400 ppm at high ph the chemical reaction of co2 with oh in the water atmosphere boundary layer can significantly increase the mass transfer of co2 from the air to the water a process referred to as chemical enhancement of co2 exchange bade and cole 2006 chemically enhanced diffusion was taken into account by in case of co2 uptake multiplying k by a chemical enhancement factor β which depends on ph temperature and k itself following eqs 4 6 in bade and cole 2006 also for each calculation of f k was adjusted for water temperature at time of dic sampling cole et al 2010 wanninkhof 2014 minimum and maximum co2 fluxes were calculated using ph measurements at the end of the light and end of the dark period the mean diel flux of co2 was calculated as a weighted average of the light and dark period fluxes based on day and nighttime length the reliability of this method was verified later in the experiment when co2 fluxes measured by the picarro gga were compared with fluxes calculated from 10 cm deep dic temperature and ph measurements taken directly after the picarro gga measurements there was a strong relationship between data of the two methods r2 0 96 fig s4 the regression of this relationship was used to adjust the calculated co2 fluxes for standardization 2 7 dissolved inorganic carbon samples for dic were carefully collected to prevent gas exchange once a week and stored in 3 ml non evacuated gas tight vials exetainer labco lampeter uk at 4 c dic was measured within 24 h after sampling by injecting a 0 2 ml sample in a closed glass chamber containing 0 2 m h3po4 solution converting the dic into co2 subsequently a continuous flow of n2 gas transported the co2 to an ao2020 continuous gas analyser abb zürich switzerland a calibration curve was made by injecting different volumes 0 1 1 0 ml of 1 25 mm hco3 solution in order to convert raw instrument output to dic mass 2 8 sedimentation each month sedimentation was determined by installing custom made tube shaped sedimentation traps 9 cm diameter 19 cm height 1 1 l volume at 1 m depth below the water surface in the center of the limnotron for 3 days contents of the sedimentation trap i e sedimented material and sestonic particulate organic carbon poc in the water inside the trap were subsequently filtered using pre washed gf f filters whatman maidstone uk dried overnight at 60 c and stored dry and dark for elemental analysis during collection of the sedimentation traps surface water was sampled using a 1 m long tube sampler in the center of the limnotron and analysed as described above to correct for sestonic poc 220 μm sedimentation rates were calculated as the amount of sedimented poc corrected for sestonic poc present inside the traps divided by the deployment time of the sedimentation traps finally the amount of sedimented organic carbon was calculated as the area under the curve of these sedimentation rates 2 9 sediment analyses homogenized sediment samples were oven dried for 2 days at 70 c subsequently a mixer mill mm 400 retsch gmbh was used to grind the dried sediment samples 25 mg of fine grind sediment was weighed in silver capsules and exposed to repeated additions of 10 µl of 25 hcl to remove carbonates nieuwenhuize et al 1994 samples were then analysed for organic carbon and nitrogen content using an na 1500 elemental analyser carlo erba 2 10 plant abundance submerged plant abundance was measured by weekly pvi percent volume infested estimates where plant height was measured with a ruler and cover was visually estimated pvi of myriophyllum spicatum was then calculated according to canfield jr et al 1984 eq 4 4 pvi plant cover plant height water colum depth duckweed cover was estimated by eye typically every 4 weeks 2 11 statistical analyses statistical analyses were carried out using python and the r software environment r core team 2019 to estimate total ghg emissions for each ecological state we summed ch4 ebullition and diffusive water atmosphere ch4 and co2 fluxes as co2 equivalents using a global warming potential gwp of 34 for ch4 fluxes corresponding to the radiative forcing over a 100 year time horizon ipcc 2013 annual average ch4 ebullition was calculated by summing ch4 ebullition measured during each bubble collection period and dividing it by the number of days between start and end of bubble collection monitoring in that respective year i e day of year doy 1 336 2 337 and 1 326 for algae submerged plant and free floating plant dominated systems respectively measured diffusive fluxes of ch4 and co2 were linearly interpolated between each measurement day starting at doy 5 4 and 4 and ending at doy 336 332 and 325 for algae submerged plant and free floating plant dominated systems respectively to obtain an estimate for each day we then averaged these daily estimates to obtain an annual average daily flux estimate the effect of experimental warming on annual daily ghg fluxes was analyzed using estimation statistics python package dabest ho et al 2019 to describe the temperature dependency of ch4 ebullition for each system we used a modified arrhenius equation eq 5 5 e t e 20 θ s t 20 where et is the ebullition rate in mg ch4 m 2 d 1 at temperature t c e 20 is the ebullition rate in mg ch4 m 2 d 1 at 20 c and θ s is the overall system temperature coefficient dimensionless kadlec and reddy 2001 veraart et al 2011 the modified arrhenius expression was fitted on the data using the levenberg marquardt nonlinear least squares algorithm function nlslm from the r package minpack lm elzhov et al 2022 despite its limitations at the lower and upper end of the temperature range the modified arrhenius expression is a useful and often applied method of determining temperature dependencies of ecological and microbiological processes aben et al 2017 kadlec and reddy 2001 veraart et al 2011 we used linear mixed effects models lmms to investigate the effect of different sets of predictors on water atmosphere greenhouse gas fluxes here limnotron and sampling date were included as crossed random effects on the intercept to account for repeated measurements in individual limnotrons l and across days d as below eq 6 6 y l d β 0 l 0 l d 0 d β 1 x 1 d β 2 x 2 d β m x m ε l d models were fitted with the lmer function from the r package lme4 bates et al 2015 using maximum likelihood ml we used the dredge function r package mumin bartoń 2022 to test models with all possible predictor combinations and ranked them by aicc based model weight burnham and anderson 2002 to meet assumptions of linearity homoscedasticity and normality of residuals fluxes were log or square root transformed when necessary to deal with mismatching predictor data due to different sampling dates we linearly interpolated data using the na approx function of the r package zoo zeileis and grothendieck 2005 for r to obtain predictor data at dates of gas flux measurement values for ebullition represent average emissions of specific periods of bubble trap deployment as explained earlier to obtain predictor data that matched these ebullition measurements we averaged the interpolated predictor data for each period of bubble trap deployment 3 results discussion 3 1 ch4 ebullition ch4 ebullition was the most important ghg emission pathway independent of the dominant plant type when considering both co2 and ch4 emissions in co2 equivalents fig 1a c considering ch4 alone diffusion and ebullition the share of ebullition ranged from 53 to over 99 table 1 which is similar to the range reported for shallow lakes and ponds measured globally zheng et al 2022 and references therein annual average ch4 ebullition rates were 9 3 38 3 and 78 4 mg ch4 m 2 d 1 under dominance of submerged plants algae and free floating plants respectively fig 1a and are in the middle of the range measured in ponds in different climate zones around the world zheng et al 2022 the effect size of experimental warming on annual ch4 ebullition as the absolute treatment difference was much larger in the algae and free floating plant dominated systems than in those dominated by submerged plants fig 1a the relative effect of experimental warming was strongest in the submerged plant dominated systems where mean annual ch4 ebullition was on average almost twice as high in the experimental warming treatment as in the control the effect size in systems with submerged plants however has a confidence interval close to the zero effect line indicating that the effect of experimental warming on ebullition is not as evident as in the algae and free floating plant dominated systems fig 2 table s1 the absolute increase in ch4 ebullition with increasing seasonal temperature was also much higher under dominance by either algae or free floating plants than by submerged plants fig 2 fig 3 ch4 ebullition at 20 c as modelled by fitting an arrhenius equation to our data was highest for the free floating plant dominated state followed by respectively the algae dominated and submerged plant dominated state fig 3 in all systems ch4 ebullition increased exponentially with warming which is in accordance with what has been found in mostly unvegetated sites in natural systems aben et al 2017 notably however ebullition started to increase at considerably higher temperatures in the submerged plant dominated state than in the other states resulting in a system temperature coefficient θ s increasing from free floating to algae to submerged plant dominated states although we took care to make sediment conditions largely equal with the bulk sediment being harvested from the same source and ensuring near equal c n ratio s for the three functional plant types small between plant treatment sediment variability may explain part of the difference in ebullition between the plant types however given that the increase in sediment mineralization with temperature is remarkably consistent for a wide range of sediments cardoso et al 2014 and given the large plant effect on oxygen conditions and sedimentation rates in our setup table 1 we argue that a large share of the temperature effect on ebullition in our systems can be explained by the differential effects the dominant plant types have on carbon processes moreover while sediment organic c was lower under algae dominance than under submerged plant dominance at the onset of the experiment table 1 ch4 ebullition was much higher under algae dominance fig 1 this further supports the notion that primary producer traits govern ch4 ebullition the amount of biomass needed to establish an algae submerged plant or free floating plant dominated system varied table 1 our findings however suggest that this did not explain the observed differences in ch4 ebullition rates for instance while the algae dominated systems had the lowest added biomass as well as the lowest final biomass and lowest carbon sedimentation rates table 1 they exhibited higher ch4 ebullition rates than the submerged plant dominated systems figs 1 2 in addition while the carbon sedimentation rates in the free floating plant dominated systems and submerged plant dominated systems were considerably higher than those in the algae dominated systems table 1 the ch4 ebullition rates between the free floating plant dominated and submerged plant dominated systems deviated much more from each other than from the algae dominated systems figs 1 2 also when we normalize the average annual ch4 ebullition for the amount of biomass in grams of c added to the systems we find that emissions for the submerged plant dominated systems are lowest and those for algae are highest fig s5 these findings substantiate that primary producer traits strongly impact ch4 production and consumption and consequent ch4 emissions overruling effects of biomass lower ebullition rates in systems dominated by submerged plants may be explained by several mechanisms first radial oxygen loss rol by the roots of submerged plants can oxidize the rhizosphere and thereby curtail ch4 emission by stimulating ch4 oxidation and inhibiting ch4 production calhoun and king 1997 dullo et al 2017 li et al 2021 myriophyllum spicatum the species used in our experiment has a high sediment oxygenating potential mermillod blondin et al 2008 with the intensity of its rol mainly determined by oxygen concentration in the water column and redox condition and microbial oxygen demand in the sediment laskov et al 2006 indeed our analyses show that both water column oxygen concentration and plant abundance as pvi were selected as important predictors that negatively affect ebullition and thus explain the emission patterns observed in our experiment table s2 which is in line with earlier observations davidson et al 2018 clearly plant abundance does not necessarily reflect plant metabolic activity and rol intensity in our experiment a decline in pvi was preceded by peak ebullition rates occurring at the highest temperatures in the warm treatment see upper panel fig 2 see velthuis et al 2018 for pvi dynamics this suggests that when plant conditions deteriorate leading to a decline in pvi so does the regulation effect of plants on ch4 ebullition we speculate that warming did not only have a direct effect on ebullition via enhanced ch4 production but that at the highest temperatures also a decrease in rol occurred leading to less ch4 oxidation the presumed combined warming effects could also explain the high system temperature coefficient θ s in the submerged plant treatment fig 3 second transport of ch4 through roots and shoots may limit ebullition by alleviating the build up of gaseous ch4 in the sediment dacey and klug 1979 heilman and carlton 2001 sanders et al 2007 the occurrence of plant mediated transport in our study was substantiated by the presence of ch4 inside the plants plant mediated ch4 fluxes may partially end up in the water column where it can be oxidized li et al 2021 or can be directly emitted to the atmosphere via the plants inflorescences heilman and carlton 2001 captured in our floating chamber measurements the highest ch4 ebullition in our setup was observed in the state with free floating plant dominance fig 1a this can likely be attributed to anaerobic mineralization of fresh organic matter sedimented at high rates table 1 dense mats of free floating plants have been shown to impede oxygen intrusion de tezanos pinto and o farrell 2014 together with the high sediment oxygen demand associated with the high sedimentation rates this may have led to oxygen poor and even anoxic waters table 1 water column anoxia is a common phenomenon during dominance by floating plants in natural systems de tezanos pinto and o farrell 2014 such anoxic conditions promote ch4 production and hamper aerobic ch4 oxidation bastviken et al 2009 this may lead to a decrease in the ch4 concentration gradient from the sediment pore water to the overlaying water resulting in a decrease in sediment water ch4 diffusion the reduced diffusive release of ch4 from the sediment in turn may increase accumulation of free ch4 gas and hence bubble release this may explain why surface water oxygen concentration was shown to be an important predictor for ebullition when floating plants were dominant table s2 anoxia also facilitates phosphorus release from sediments table 1 resulting in a positive feedback loop between duckweed cover preferring high p concentrations and p availability boedeltje et al 2005 kazanjian et al 2018a 3 2 diffusive ch4 emissions annual average ch4 diffusion rates were 4 5 2 9 and 12 0 mg ch4 m 2 d 1 under dominance of submerged plants algae and free floating plants respectively fig 4 these fluxes are at the lower end of the range measured globally for small lakes 0 001 km² and ponds on average around 36 mg ch4 m 2 d 1 holgerson and raymond 2016 zheng et al 2022 diffusive ch4 emissions correlated positively with seasonal changes in water temperature in both the 4 c warming treatment and the ambient controls of all three states fig 4 despite this the data show very little support for a positive effect of the 4 c warming treatment in the three different states and in fact are most indicative for a negative effect of experimental warming in algae and free floating plant dominated states fig 1b fig 4 table s1 diffusive ch4 fluxes were particularly high when free floating plants dominated fig 1b which is likely associated with the dissolution of ch4 from bubbles trapped under the plant mats and the likely shallower oxygen penetration depth in the sediment due to water column hypoxia water column hypoxia below floating plants happens in a wide range of freshwater ecosystems ranging from ponds and ditches to tropical lakes de tezanos pinto and o farrell 2014 rodríguez et al 2012 scheffer et al 2003 low oxygen concentrations in the water column results in a shallower zone for ch4 oxidation at the sediment water interface the place where the majority of ch4 oxidation is to be expected bastviken et al 2009 in combination with the reduced water atmosphere gas exchange kosten et al 2016 this likely also explains the high ch4 concentrations in the water column table 1 dense free floating plant coverage may reduce the water atmosphere gas exchange by up to 90 kosten et al 2016 yet despite this reduced gas exchange the measured diffusive ch4 fluxes strongly exceeded the calculated diffusive fluxes based on ch4 concentrations and air water gas exchange velocities during the warmer periods in our experiment fig s6 this is very likely explained by diffusive release of ch4 from bubbles trapped underneath the free floating plant mats when ebullition is high fig s7 3 3 diffusive co2 fluxes in the submerged plant and algae dominated systems there was little evidence for an important effect of the experimental warming treatment on diffusive co2 fluxes in systems with free floating plants the data best support a positive effect of experimental warming on co2 fluxes fig 1c table s1 fig 5 there were quite large differences in fluxes between the different ecosystem states while the submerged plant dominated systems showed net co2 uptake the algae dominated systems were net emitters of co2 fig 1c as a result of the relatively low primary production kazanjian et al 2018b the latter was likely related to phosphorus limitation as demonstrated by surface water phosphate concentrations which were very low throughout most of the year table 1 and resulted in higher seston n p ratios velthuis et al 2017 in contrast rooted submerged plants like the species in our experiment m spicatum take up most of their n and p directly from the sediment via their root system barko et al 1991 indeed annual average sd n as nh4 no3 and po4 3 p concentrations in sediment pore waters 3350 1149 µg l 1 and 147 36 µg l 1 respectively were an order of magnitude higher than in the water column 132 19 µg l 1 and 25 0 0 3 µg l 1 respectively moreover both n 3 4 0 7 and p 0 46 0 17 contents of dried plant shoots mean s d were far above values that are indicative of suboptimal growth i e 0 75 and 0 07 for n and p respectively gerloff 1975 this indicates that primary production under dominance by submerged plants was likely not limited by n and p availability and can explain the observed net co2 uptake the free floating plant dominated state shows large variation in co2 fluxes among replicates within both temperature treatments this variation strongly exceeded that of the other two states figs 1c 5 3 4 combined ghg fluxes and water management implications all in all we show that the effect of warming on total ghg emissions from experimental ponds is greatest under dominance by free floating plants and smallest when submerged plants dominate fig 6 which can be mainly attributed to a differential temperature effect on methane ebullition when comparing the different states our findings suggest that the total ghg emissions decline going from free floating plant to algae to submerged plant dominated state these results can have major implications as climate warming can both enhance ch4 production rates aben et al 2017 davidson et al 2018 marotta et al 2014 and favor free floating plant or phytoplankton dominance over submerged plant dominance meerhoff et al 2022 our results indicate that ch4 emissions may be enhanced more than expected based on direct temperature effects alone in our systems the enhanced ch4 emissions were not offset by an increase in co2 uptake hence our findings suggest that the combined effect of warming and displacement of submerged plants by algae or free floating plants exacerbates the increase in ghg emissions this indicates a positive feed back loop in which enhanced ghg emissions accelerate climate warming fig 7 notably different plant traits e g having roots that enable p uptake from sediments and the ability to use hco3 as c source not only affect ghg emission and uptake but also the resources available to the plants disentangling the direct and indirect plant effects on warming induced changes in ghg emissions therefore remains complex the fact that ghg emissions were lowest in the submerged plant dominated state both under control and warmed conditions may have major implications for water management across the world water managers target dominance by submerged plants as it generally coincides with higher water quality clear water higher biodiversity and a broader range of ecosystem services janssen et al 2021 this generally requires a combination of costly management strategies to maintain this ecosystem state e g external and internal nutrient load reduction fish community manipulation and or harvesting free floating plants hilt et al 2018 smolders et al 2006 the benefits of mitigating ghg emissions by the restoration of submerged vegetation fig 7 can provide additional leverage and even outweigh their costs downing et al 2021 as the measures may eventually result in a situation beneficial from an ecological societal and climate perspective 4 conclusions shifts from submerged plant to algae or free floating plant dominance may increase the magnitude and temperature sensitivity of ghg emissions from shallow aquatic ecosystems this may trigger a positive feedback loop as climate change is expected to enhance shifts to algae or free floating plant dominance ch4 ebullition was the most important ghg emission pathway both in terms of emission magnitude and its sensitivity to experimental warming hence we stress the need for accurate quantification of ch4 ebullition at high spatiotemporal scales as well as technological advances that ease the quantification of ch4 bubble fluxes to the atmosphere in floating plant beds restoration of submerged vegetation may limit increases in ghg emissions due to climate change credit authorship contribution statement ralf c h aben

15385,greenhouse gas ghg emissions from small inland waters are disproportionately large climate warming is expected to favor dominance of algae and free floating plants at the expense of submerged plants through different routes these functional plant types may have far reaching impacts on freshwater ghg emissions in future warmer waters which are yet unknown we conducted a 1 000 l mesocosm experiment testing the effects of plant type and warming on ghg emissions from temperate inland waters dominated by either algae free floating or submerged plants in controls and warmed 4 c treatments for one year each our results show that the effect of experimental warming on ghg fluxes differs between dominance of different functional plant types mainly by modulating methane ebullition an often dominant ghg emission pathway specifically we demonstrate that the response to experimental warming was strongest for free floating and lowest for submerged plant dominated systems importantly our results suggest that anticipated shifts in plant type from submerged plants to a dominance of algae or free floating plants with warming may increase total ghg emissions from shallow waters this together with a warming induced emission response represents a so far overlooked positive climate feedback management strategies aimed at favouring submerged plant dominance may thus substantially mitigate ghg emissions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords greenhouse gas emission climate warming methane carbon dioxide ebullition alternative states data availability the data that support the findings of this study are archived in the dans easy repository https doi org 10 17026 dans zqj dyrc 1 introduction shallow freshwater ecosystems typically represent a specific ecological state characterized by the dominance of different functional plant types submerged plants phytoplankton or free floating plants scheffer and carpenter 2003 scheffer and van nes 2007 shifts between these ecological states can occur rather sudden for instance due to storms or water level changes see scheffer 1998 these so called alternative states affect primary production biogeochemical processes and important ecosystem services carpenter and lodge 1986 de tezanos pinto and o farrell 2014 hilt et al 2017 janssen et al 2021 while blooms of all primary producers can lead to anoxia under eutrophic conditions e g istvánovics 2009 in mesotrophic conditions dominance by free floating plants such as lemna for instance typically leads to much lower oxygen concentrations in the water and sediment as compared to submerged plant and algae dominated states netten et al 2010 this is mainly due to decreased phytoplankton photosynthesis below the shading plant canopy decreased diffusion of oxygen through the plant mats and decaying plant matter resulting in high sediment oxygen demand de tezanos pinto and o farrell 2014 these low oxygen conditions potentially promote methane ch4 emission shifts in dominance of different types of plants may therefore have far reaching implications for freshwater greenhouse gas ghg emissions hilt et al 2017 li et al 2021 comparisons of ghg carbon dioxide co2 ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions between distinct alternative states have so far been based on a limited number of field observations and have been complicated by a range of confounding factors such as a lack of standardized methods and the omission of certain ghgs as well as their relevant emission pathways such as ch4 ebullition bubble flux of ch4 from sediments hilt et al 2017 li et al 2021 hence it remains unclear how shifts in plant dominance will affect ghg emissions based on the increase of individual metabolic rates it is expected that higher temperatures will disproportionally increase ecosystem respiration relative to gross primary production allen et al 2005 yvon durocher et al 2010 which may lead to a reduced net co2 uptake while some studies confirm this effect of warming yvon durocher et al 2017 others do not find such an effect davidson et al 2015 or even find a lower net co2 efflux with warming davidson et al 2015 these contrasting results may be due to differences in the availability of growth limiting resources e g nitrogen and phosphorus food web structure as well as indirect effects of temperature the latter includes effects of temperature on the abundance growth strategies and key traits of the plants and microorganisms present which may override the effects of temperature on the metabolic rates at the subcellular and individual level davidson et al 2015 dossena et al 2012 hood et al 2018 kraemer et al 2017 similarly effects of temperature on ch4 emission are ambiguous although ch4 production by methanogenic archaea mainly in sediments tends to be temperature dependent when sufficient substrate is available fuchs et al 2016 marotta et al 2014 not all ch4 reaches the atmosphere as part of it is subject to microbial oxidation of ch4 mainly in the sediment water interface and water column bastviken et al 2009 a process which is also temperature dependent fuchs et al 2016 lofton et al 2014 shelley et al 2015 differential temperature effects on ch4 production and ch4 oxidation fuchs et al 2016 lofton et al 2014 shelley et al 2015 as well as warming induced shifts in the microbial community zhu et al 2020 may explain the differential effects of warming on diffusive ch4 emissions reported in the literature varying from positive effects to the absence of effects aben et al 2017 davidson et al 2015 yvon durocher et al 2014 zhu et al 2020 the effect of warming on ch4 ebullition however seems unambiguous as reports so far indicate a strong increase with warming provided that substrates for ch4 production are not limiting aben et al 2017 davidson et al 2018 delsontro et al 2016 ch4 ebullition largely bypasses microbial ch4 oxidation and is often found to be the dominant ghg emission pathway in inland waters bastviken et al 2009 despite this ebullition is often not measured or only measured at short time intervals minutes to hours which likely results in an underestimation of this strongly episodic flux hilt et al 2017 saunois et al 2016 wik et al 2016 to date however most ebullition measurements have been conducted at unvegetated sites e g aben et al 2017 furthermore ebullition data recorded over a considerable temperature range are rare for systems dominated by submerged plants but see davidson et al 2018 and even more so for systems dominated by free floating plants possibly due to methodological difficulties see methods yet these functional plant types can strongly modify ch4 production consumption and transportation see bodmer et al 2021 for an overview of the different processes thereby likely leading to a differential temperature effect on ch4 ebullition under contrasting ecosystem states however although climate warming can increase the chances of shifts from dominance by submerged plants to dominance by free floating plants or algae mooij et al 2007 netten et al 2011 peeters et al 2013 not much is known about the consequences of these shifts for ghg emissions in general hilt et al 2017 and ebullition in particular the question therefore remains how dominance of different functional plant types in shallow lakes and ponds will affect ghg emissions and the impact of climate warming on these emissions to answer this fundamental question we used indoor 1000 liter experimental ponds containing natural lake sediments and overlaying water and experimentally tested in three consecutive years how warming 4 c n 4 affected year round ghg emissions in the temperate climate zone under dominance of different functional plant types dominance by submerged plants myriophyllum spicatum free floating plants lemna minor spirodela polyrhiza or algae we measured emissions of all important ghgs i e co2 ch4 and n2o and the contributions of their relevant emission pathways 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiment was conducted in eight cylindrical stainless steel indoor mesocosms called limnotrons with a volume of 988 l a depth of 1 34 m and a diameter of 0 97 m area 0 74 m² situated at the netherlands institute of ecology see verschoor et al 2003 for details for this study limnotrons were set up to mimic shallow temperate latitude ponds and lakes with moderate nutrient concentrations systems where alternative states are possible scheffer and van nes 2007 starting in 2014 three states with dominance of different types of plants were studied consecutively each for a full year an algae submerged plant and free floating plant dominated state temperature treatments consisted of a control n 4 with seasonally varying water temperatures typical for dutch lakes fig 2 and a warm 4 c treatment consistent with predicted warming by the end of the 21st century in north and central europe under intermediate anthropogenic ghg emissions scenario rcp6 0 ipcc 2013 both temperature treatments included a five day midsummer heat wave 4 c as heat waves are expected to occur more often in the future ipcc 2013 as we do not have a control for the heat wave we refrain from speculating about its effects the light dark cycle followed dutch seasonality with 17 h of daylight in midsummer and 8 h of daylight in midwinter the limnotrons were emptied and cleaned for each state soft muddy sediment was collected from a nearby mesotrophic pond 51 59 16 0 n 5 40 06 1 e sieved over a 5 mm mesh and homogenized by thorough manual mixing before adding it to the limnotrons approximately 75 l of sediment was added to each limnotron two weeks before the start of the experiment of each plant type sediment organic c and c n ratios table 1 were similar to those of shallow lakes and ponds with a similar trophic state gilbert et al 2021 marotta et al 2014 to maintain sediment characteristics as similar as possible for the different states while also mimicking approximate sediment conditions that correspond to the different functional plant types dominating the system we used sediment from the above mentioned pond for all three states for the submerged plant state we mixed sediment collected the year before with fresh sediment 1 to 2 parts v v to ensure the presence of fresh organic matter for the free floating plants state freshly collected sediment from the pond was mixed with sediment from the previous state 1 to 14 parts v v duckweed dominance is stabilized by the presence of propagules in the sediment boedeltje et al 2005 hence we subsequently spiked 1 to 28 parts v v the systems with sediment from a nearby duckweed dominated ditch 51 59 43 3 n 5 38 38 7 e after the introduction of the sediment the limnotrons were filled to the top with tap water water was circulated manually between all limnotrons for 2 days to ensure homogeneous starting conditions an aquarium

installed above each limnotron to promote a gas exchange velocity typical of small lakes and ponds see supplementary methods for details lastly limnotrons were spiked with nutrients and the different types of plants were introduced at densities typical for the respective state see below for details limnotrons were left to establish for ca 2 weeks prior to experimental warming at temperatures of ca 5 control and 8 warmed c throughout the experiment limnotrons were gently refilled with demineralized water once or twice per week to compensate for evaporative losses 2 2 plant characteristics for the algae dominated state limnotrons were inoculated with a phytoplankton community from the same mesotrophic pond where the sediment was collected and an additional 15 inoculum from a nearby eutrophic pond 51 59 16 3 n 5 40 06 0 e on 15 february 2014 this resulted in an initial biomass of 2 2 0 4 g c m 2 table 1 typical for temperate mesotrophic freshwater bodies in spring e g nixdorf and

regions grin database https www ars grin gov npgs verified 23 january 2018 plants with a median length of about 80 cm including roots were collected from the pond the sediment originated from in march 2016 and carefully washed to remove macroinvertebrates and their eggs we introduced five plants to each mesocosm by tying a pebble just above their roots to sink them to the sediment due to limited initial growth four and six additional plants were added to each limnotron in the same way at seven and sixteen weeks after the start of the experiment respectively this resulted in a plant density of

photo to a dry weight biomass as explained in fig s1 for the free floating plant dominated state a community of duckweed species mainly lemna minor spirodela polyrhiza was collected on 19 april 2016 from an agricultural ditch in ysselsteyn the netherlands and introduced to the limnotrons the mentioned duckweed species are native and common free floating plants in most temperate climate regions

macroinvertebrates and their eggs we then introduced 500 g fw of duckweed to each limnotron which resulted in 100 surface cover which is typical for temperate waterbodies dominated by duckweed e g kazanjian et al 2018a throughout the year the community was dominated by lemna minor and spirodela polyrhiza the cold water at the start of the experiment combined with the thin plant mat likely delayed the onset of low oxygen conditions and related nutrient release de tezanos pinto and o farrell 2014 thereby hampering duckweed growth to overcome this growth constraint and to hasten the development of hypoxic conditions we added extra biomass 600 g fw to each limnotron on day of year doy 29 during the second half of the experiment we experienced a large die off of free floating plants due to infection by cataclysta lemnata larvae also known to occur in systems outdoors e g arts et al 2001 to compensate for this we re introduced biomass 400 g fw to each limnotron on doy 211

fluxes throughout the experiment ch4 release via ebullition was determined by continuous collection of gas bubbles from the sediment using custom made bubble traps bubble traps consist of an inverted funnel id 15 2 cm connected to a water filled glass container via an 80 cm long tube id 10 mm each limnotron contained two bubble traps with funnels being approximately 50 cm under the water surface gas filled glass containers were collected and immediately replaced by new ones a total of 10 13 and 13 times during the submerged plant free floating plant and algae dominated states respectively always before being completely filled with gas the deployment time of glass containers before being replaced depended on the ebullition rate and ranged from 11 to 89 median 25 7 to 64 median 18 and 8

and a flame ionization detector hewlett packard palo alto ca usa the amount of gaseous ch4 in each bottle was determined by multiplying the ch4 concentration c gas by the volume of gas v gas the ch4

whether measurements triggered bubble release we observed no effect prior to the harvest of submerged plants random plant stems were broken and evolving gas bubbles were captured by enclosing the stem with inverted water filled 12 ml gas tight vials exetainer labco lampeter uk subsequently ch4 concentrations of captured gas were determined as described above estimating ch4 ebullition in free floating plant dominated systems is not straightforward as part of the evolved bubbles are trapped under dense free floating plant mats based on plant cover and the empirical relationship reported in kosten et al 2016 we assumed that in our systems 20 of measured ebullition was trapped we therefore reduced the ebullitive flux measured below the free floating plants with 20 to get an estimate of the ebullitive emission to the atmosphere ch4 from trapped bubbles may partially dissolve and can be consumed by microbes in the aerobic rhizosphere of the free floating plants kosten et al 2016 2 5 diffusive greenhouse gas fluxes diffusive fluxes of ch4 and co2 were measured using an acrylic cylindrical transparent chamber id 29 2 cm connected in a closed loop to a greenhouse gas analyser gga during the first six months of the algae dominated state ch4 concentrations were measured using off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy gga model gga 24r ep los gatos research while co2 concentrations were determined from ph temperature and dissolved inorganic carbon measurements see following paragraph all measurements of n2o ch4 and co2 thereafter were conducted using a wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy gga model g2508 picarro both devices measured at 1 hz intervals and yielded similar results in a post experiment comparative test ensuring no analyser related bias measurements of 3 5 min were performed in triplicate and were repeated when influenced by ebullition evidenced as an abrupt concentration increase in between measurements the chamber was ventilated with ambient air diffusive fluxes were typically measured every 2 4 weeks dominance by submerged and free floating plants and every 2 weeks dominance by algae during the pre heat wave period and every 4 5 weeks during the post heat wave period in all cases additional measurements were performed in the week before during and after the heat wave the slope of the relationship between gas concentration and time was used to calculate fluxes delsontro et al 2016 eq 2 2 f v a slope p f 1 f 2 r t where f is the gas flux g m 2 d 1 v is chamber headspace volume m3 measured during the measurement and a is chamber surface area m2 slope is the slope of the relationship between the ghg concentration and the time ppm second 1 p is atmospheric pressure pa f1 is the molar mass of the respective ghgs co2 44 01 n2o 44 01 or ch4 16 04 g mol 1 f2 is the conversion factor of seconds to days r is the ideal gas constant 8 3145 m3 pa k 1 mol 1 t is the water temperature k in the free floating plant dominated state deployment of the floating chamber during warm periods with high ebullition led to an initial peak in ch4 concentration even in replicate measurements followed by a strong linear increase over the following minutes only the latter was used to calculate the diffusive flux both the initial peak as well as the large magnitude of the diffusive flux are likely caused by the release of ch4 from trapped bubbles under the plant mats as described above although part of this gaseous ch4 may have diffused to the atmosphere also without the disturbance of the floating chamber deployment we subtracted the fraction of ebullition estimated to be retained under the plant mats described above from the measured diffusive flux we argue that we hereby obtained a conservative estimate of the diffusive ch4 flux as under natural conditions wind and animals e g birds fish can displace floating plant mats which would further enhance ch4 emissions to the atmosphere diffusive fluxes were always measured at the end of the day as well as at the end of the night period to capture expected minimum and maximum fluxes of co2 respectively mean diel fluxes of ch4 and co2 were calculated as a weighted average of the light and dark period fluxes based on day and nighttime length limnotrons were always measured in random order to avoid potential bias by time or order related effects a leakage test was performed on each measurement day to ensure no leakage was present in the closed loop system to this end the chamber base was sealed to a flat surface using terostat ix teroson the opening at the top of the chamber was then closed with a cap containing a septum through which methane was injected a ch4 concentration of approximately 15 ppm was then used to check for leakages over a 20 30 min period no leakages were detected throughout the experiment we observed no emission of n2o except for day 196 of the experiment where n2o emission was observed in a control mesocosm of the algae dominated state 4 8 mg n2o m 2 d 1 hence n2o emission was of trivial importance for the overall ghg emissions and therefore not included in our analyses 2 6 calculated co2 water atmosphere fluxes though the majority of diffusive co2 fluxes were measured using a gga as discussed above this was not possible during the first six months of the experiment with algae as the dominant primary producer due to a malfunctioning co2 sensor in the los gatos gga during this period we determined co2 fluxes as follows eq 3 3 f k c sur c eq where f is the flux mg co2 m 2 d 1 k is the piston velocity m d 1 and c sur and c eq are surface water and air equilibrium co2 concentrations mg co2 m 3 cole et al 2010 respectively piston velocity as ko2 was empirically determined at temperatures of 8 5 16 5 and 24 5 c in an additional limnotron that did not contain sediment using deoxygenated water after tribe et al 1995 the data of these experiments can be found in fig s2 standardizing these k measurements by respective schmidt numbers and an exponent n of 0 67 for low wind systems cole et al 2010 wanninkhof 2014 resulted in a k 600 of 0 43 0 03 m d 1 mean s d fig s3 which is typical for small lakes and ponds holgerson and raymond 2016 c sur was calculated from measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon dic ph temperature and dissociation constants of carbonic acid in pure water millero et al 2006 according to the equations in table 4 2 of stumm and morgan 1996 c eq was calculated using henry s law and its solubility constant for co2 after sander 2015 taking the respective water temperatures into account and assuming an atmospheric co2 fraction of 400 ppm at high ph the chemical reaction of co2 with oh in the water atmosphere boundary layer can significantly increase the mass transfer of co2 from the air to the water a process referred to as chemical enhancement of co2 exchange bade and cole 2006 chemically enhanced diffusion was taken into account by in case of co2 uptake multiplying k by a chemical enhancement factor β which depends on ph temperature and k itself following eqs 4 6 in bade and cole 2006 also for each calculation of f k was adjusted for water temperature at time of dic sampling cole et al 2010 wanninkhof 2014 minimum and maximum co2 fluxes were calculated using ph measurements at the end of the light and end of the dark period the mean diel flux of co2 was calculated as a weighted average of the light and dark period fluxes based on day and nighttime length the reliability of this method was verified later in the experiment when co2 fluxes measured by the picarro gga were compared with fluxes calculated from 10 cm deep dic temperature and ph measurements taken directly after the picarro gga measurements there was a strong relationship between data of the two methods r2 0 96 fig s4 the regression of this relationship was used to adjust the calculated co2 fluxes for standardization 2 7 dissolved inorganic carbon samples for dic were carefully collected to prevent gas exchange once a week and stored in 3 ml non evacuated gas tight vials exetainer labco lampeter uk at 4 c dic was measured within 24 h after sampling by injecting a 0 2 ml sample in a closed glass chamber containing 0 2 m h3po4 solution converting the dic into co2 subsequently a continuous flow of n2 gas transported the co2 to an ao2020 continuous gas analyser abb zürich switzerland a calibration curve was made by injecting different volumes 0 1 1 0 ml of 1 25 mm hco3 solution in order to convert raw instrument output to dic mass 2 8 sedimentation each month sedimentation was determined by installing custom made tube shaped sedimentation traps 9 cm diameter 19 cm height 1 1 l volume at 1 m depth below the water surface in the center of the limnotron for 3 days contents of the sedimentation trap i e sedimented material and sestonic particulate organic carbon poc in the water inside the trap were subsequently filtered using pre washed gf f filters whatman maidstone uk dried overnight at 60 c and stored dry and dark for elemental analysis during collection of the sedimentation traps surface water was sampled using a 1 m long tube sampler in the center of the limnotron and analysed as described above to correct for sestonic poc 220 μm sedimentation rates were calculated as the amount of sedimented poc corrected for sestonic poc present inside the traps divided by the deployment time of the sedimentation traps finally the amount of sedimented organic carbon was calculated as the area under the curve of these sedimentation rates 2 9 sediment analyses homogenized sediment samples were oven dried for 2 days at 70 c subsequently a mixer mill mm 400 retsch gmbh was used to grind the dried sediment samples 25 mg of fine grind sediment was weighed in silver capsules and exposed to repeated additions of 10 µl of 25 hcl to remove carbonates nieuwenhuize et al 1994 samples were then analysed for organic carbon and nitrogen content using an na 1500 elemental analyser carlo erba 2 10 plant abundance submerged plant abundance was measured by weekly pvi percent volume infested estimates where plant height was measured with a ruler and cover was visually estimated pvi of myriophyllum spicatum was then calculated according to canfield jr et al 1984 eq 4 4 pvi plant cover plant height water colum depth duckweed cover was estimated by eye typically every 4 weeks 2 11 statistical analyses statistical analyses were carried out using python and the r software environment r core team 2019 to estimate total ghg emissions for each ecological state we summed ch4 ebullition and diffusive water atmosphere ch4 and co2 fluxes as co2 equivalents using a global warming potential gwp of 34 for ch4 fluxes corresponding to the radiative forcing over a 100 year time horizon ipcc 2013 annual average ch4 ebullition was calculated by summing ch4 ebullition measured during each bubble collection period and dividing it by the number of days between start and end of bubble collection monitoring in that respective year i e day of year doy 1 336 2 337 and 1 326 for algae submerged plant and free floating plant dominated systems respectively measured diffusive fluxes of ch4 and co2 were linearly interpolated between each measurement day starting at doy 5 4 and 4 and ending at doy 336 332 and 325 for algae submerged plant and free floating plant dominated systems respectively to obtain an estimate for each day we then averaged these daily estimates to obtain an annual average daily flux estimate the effect of experimental warming on annual daily ghg fluxes was analyzed using estimation statistics python package dabest ho et al 2019 to describe the temperature dependency of ch4 ebullition for each system we used a modified arrhenius equation eq 5 5 e t e 20 θ s t 20 where et is the ebullition rate in mg ch4 m 2 d 1 at temperature t c e 20 is the ebullition rate in mg ch4 m 2 d 1 at 20 c and θ s is the overall system temperature coefficient dimensionless kadlec and reddy 2001 veraart et al 2011 the modified arrhenius expression was fitted on the data using the levenberg marquardt nonlinear least squares algorithm function nlslm from the r package minpack lm elzhov et al 2022 despite its limitations at the lower and upper end of the temperature range the modified arrhenius expression is a useful and often applied method of determining temperature dependencies of ecological and microbiological processes aben et al 2017 kadlec and reddy 2001 veraart et al 2011 we used linear mixed effects models lmms to investigate the effect of different sets of predictors on water atmosphere greenhouse gas fluxes here limnotron and sampling date were included as crossed random effects on the intercept to account for repeated measurements in individual limnotrons l and across days d as below eq 6 6 y l d β 0 l 0 l d 0 d β 1 x 1 d β 2 x 2 d β m x m ε l d models were fitted with the lmer function from the r package lme4 bates et al 2015 using maximum likelihood ml we used the dredge function r package mumin bartoń 2022 to test models with all possible predictor combinations and ranked them by aicc based model weight burnham and anderson 2002 to meet assumptions of linearity homoscedasticity and normality of residuals fluxes were log or square root transformed when necessary to deal with mismatching predictor data due to different sampling dates we linearly interpolated data using the na approx function of the r package zoo zeileis and grothendieck 2005 for r to obtain predictor data at dates of gas flux measurement values for ebullition represent average emissions of specific periods of bubble trap deployment as explained earlier to obtain predictor data that matched these ebullition measurements we averaged the interpolated predictor data for each period of bubble trap deployment 3 results discussion 3 1 ch4 ebullition ch4 ebullition was the most important ghg emission pathway independent of the dominant plant type when considering both co2 and ch4 emissions in co2 equivalents fig 1a c considering ch4 alone diffusion and ebullition the share of ebullition ranged from 53 to over 99 table 1 which is similar to the range reported for shallow lakes and ponds measured globally zheng et al 2022 and references therein annual average ch4 ebullition rates were 9 3 38 3 and 78 4 mg ch4 m 2 d 1 under dominance of submerged plants algae and free floating plants respectively fig 1a and are in the middle of the range measured in ponds in different climate zones around the world zheng et al 2022 the effect size of experimental warming on annual ch4 ebullition as the absolute treatment difference was much larger in the algae and free floating plant dominated systems than in those dominated by submerged plants fig 1a the relative effect of experimental warming was strongest in the submerged plant dominated systems where mean annual ch4 ebullition was on average almost twice as high in the experimental warming treatment as in the control the effect size in systems with submerged plants however has a confidence interval close to the zero effect line indicating that the effect of experimental warming on ebullition is not as evident as in the algae and free floating plant dominated systems fig 2 table s1 the absolute increase in ch4 ebullition with increasing seasonal temperature was also much higher under dominance by either algae or free floating plants than by submerged plants fig 2 fig 3 ch4 ebullition at 20 c as modelled by fitting an arrhenius equation to our data was highest for the free floating plant dominated state followed by respectively the algae dominated and submerged plant dominated state fig 3 in all systems ch4 ebullition increased exponentially with warming which is in accordance with what has been found in mostly unvegetated sites in natural systems aben et al 2017 notably however ebullition started to increase at considerably higher temperatures in the submerged plant dominated state than in the other states resulting in a system temperature coefficient θ s increasing from free floating to algae to submerged plant dominated states although we took care to make sediment conditions largely equal with the bulk sediment being harvested from the same source and ensuring near equal c n ratio s for the three functional plant types small between plant treatment sediment variability may explain part of the difference in ebullition between the plant types however given that the increase in sediment mineralization with temperature is remarkably consistent for a wide range of sediments cardoso et al 2014 and given the large plant effect on oxygen conditions and sedimentation rates in our setup table 1 we argue that a large share of the temperature effect on ebullition in our systems can be explained by the differential effects the dominant plant types have on carbon processes moreover while sediment organic c was lower under algae dominance than under submerged plant dominance at the onset of the experiment table 1 ch4 ebullition was much higher under algae dominance fig 1 this further supports the notion that primary producer traits govern ch4 ebullition the amount of biomass needed to establish an algae submerged plant or free floating plant dominated system varied table 1 our findings however suggest that this did not explain the observed differences in ch4 ebullition rates for instance while the algae dominated systems had the lowest added biomass as well as the lowest final biomass and lowest carbon sedimentation rates table 1 they exhibited higher ch4 ebullition rates than the submerged plant dominated systems figs 1 2 in addition while the carbon sedimentation rates in the free floating plant dominated systems and submerged plant dominated systems were considerably higher than those in the algae dominated systems table 1 the ch4 ebullition rates between the free floating plant dominated and submerged plant dominated systems deviated much more from each other than from the algae dominated systems figs 1 2 also when we normalize the average annual ch4 ebullition for the amount of biomass in grams of c added to the systems we find that emissions for the submerged plant dominated systems are lowest and those for algae are highest fig s5 these findings substantiate that primary producer traits strongly impact ch4 production and consumption and consequent ch4 emissions overruling effects of biomass lower ebullition rates in systems dominated by submerged plants may be explained by several mechanisms first radial oxygen loss rol by the roots of submerged plants can oxidize the rhizosphere and thereby curtail ch4 emission by stimulating ch4 oxidation and inhibiting ch4 production calhoun and king 1997 dullo et al 2017 li et al 2021 myriophyllum spicatum the species used in our experiment has a high sediment oxygenating potential mermillod blondin et al 2008 with the intensity of its rol mainly determined by oxygen concentration in the water column and redox condition and microbial oxygen demand in the sediment laskov et al 2006 indeed our analyses show that both water column oxygen concentration and plant abundance as pvi were selected as important predictors that negatively affect ebullition and thus explain the emission patterns observed in our experiment table s2 which is in line with earlier observations davidson et al 2018 clearly plant abundance does not necessarily reflect plant metabolic activity and rol intensity in our experiment a decline in pvi was preceded by peak ebullition rates occurring at the highest temperatures in the warm treatment see upper panel fig 2 see velthuis et al 2018 for pvi dynamics this suggests that when plant conditions deteriorate leading to a decline in pvi so does the regulation effect of plants on ch4 ebullition we speculate that warming did not only have a direct effect on ebullition via enhanced ch4 production but that at the highest temperatures also a decrease in rol occurred leading to less ch4 oxidation the presumed combined warming effects could also explain the high system temperature coefficient θ s in the submerged plant treatment fig 3 second transport of ch4 through roots and shoots may limit ebullition by alleviating the build up of gaseous ch4 in the sediment dacey and klug 1979 heilman and carlton 2001 sanders et al 2007 the occurrence of plant mediated transport in our study was substantiated by the presence of ch4 inside the plants plant mediated ch4 fluxes may partially end up in the water column where it can be oxidized li et al 2021 or can be directly emitted to the atmosphere via the plants inflorescences heilman and carlton 2001 captured in our floating chamber measurements the highest ch4 ebullition in our setup was observed in the state with free floating plant dominance fig 1a this can likely be attributed to anaerobic mineralization of fresh organic matter sedimented at high rates table 1 dense mats of free floating plants have been shown to impede oxygen intrusion de tezanos pinto and o farrell 2014 together with the high sediment oxygen demand associated with the high sedimentation rates this may have led to oxygen poor and even anoxic waters table 1 water column anoxia is a common phenomenon during dominance by floating plants in natural systems de tezanos pinto and o farrell 2014 such anoxic conditions promote ch4 production and hamper aerobic ch4 oxidation bastviken et al 2009 this may lead to a decrease in the ch4 concentration gradient from the sediment pore water to the overlaying water resulting in a decrease in sediment water ch4 diffusion the reduced diffusive release of ch4 from the sediment in turn may increase accumulation of free ch4 gas and hence bubble release this may explain why surface water oxygen concentration was shown to be an important predictor for ebullition when floating plants were dominant table s2 anoxia also facilitates phosphorus release from sediments table 1 resulting in a positive feedback loop between duckweed cover preferring high p concentrations and p availability boedeltje et al 2005 kazanjian et al 2018a 3 2 diffusive ch4 emissions annual average ch4 diffusion rates were 4 5 2 9 and 12 0 mg ch4 m 2 d 1 under dominance of submerged plants algae and free floating plants respectively fig 4 these fluxes are at the lower end of the range measured globally for small lakes 0 001 km² and ponds on average around 36 mg ch4 m 2 d 1 holgerson and raymond 2016 zheng et al 2022 diffusive ch4 emissions correlated positively with seasonal changes in water temperature in both the 4 c warming treatment and the ambient controls of all three states fig 4 despite this the data show very little support for a positive effect of the 4 c warming treatment in the three different states and in fact are most indicative for a negative effect of experimental warming in algae and free floating plant dominated states fig 1b fig 4 table s1 diffusive ch4 fluxes were particularly high when free floating plants dominated fig 1b which is likely associated with the dissolution of ch4 from bubbles trapped under the plant mats and the likely shallower oxygen penetration depth in the sediment due to water column hypoxia water column hypoxia below floating plants happens in a wide range of freshwater ecosystems ranging from ponds and ditches to tropical lakes de tezanos pinto and o farrell 2014 rodríguez et al 2012 scheffer et al 2003 low oxygen concentrations in the water column results in a shallower zone for ch4 oxidation at the sediment water interface the place where the majority of ch4 oxidation is to be expected bastviken et al 2009 in combination with the reduced water atmosphere gas exchange kosten et al 2016 this likely also explains the high ch4 concentrations in the water column table 1 dense free floating plant coverage may reduce the water atmosphere gas exchange by up to 90 kosten et al 2016 yet despite this reduced gas exchange the measured diffusive ch4 fluxes strongly exceeded the calculated diffusive fluxes based on ch4 concentrations and air water gas exchange velocities during the warmer periods in our experiment fig s6 this is very likely explained by diffusive release of ch4 from bubbles trapped underneath the free floating plant mats when ebullition is high fig s7 3 3 diffusive co2 fluxes in the submerged plant and algae dominated systems there was little evidence for an important effect of the experimental warming treatment on diffusive co2 fluxes in systems with free floating plants the data best support a positive effect of experimental warming on co2 fluxes fig 1c table s1 fig 5 there were quite large differences in fluxes between the different ecosystem states while the submerged plant dominated systems showed net co2 uptake the algae dominated systems were net emitters of co2 fig 1c as a result of the relatively low primary production kazanjian et al 2018b the latter was likely related to phosphorus limitation as demonstrated by surface water phosphate concentrations which were very low throughout most of the year table 1 and resulted in higher seston n p ratios velthuis et al 2017 in contrast rooted submerged plants like the species in our experiment m spicatum take up most of their n and p directly from the sediment via their root system barko et al 1991 indeed annual average sd n as nh4 no3 and po4 3 p concentrations in sediment pore waters 3350 1149 µg l 1 and 147 36 µg l 1 respectively were an order of magnitude higher than in the water column 132 19 µg l 1 and 25 0 0 3 µg l 1 respectively moreover both n 3 4 0 7 and p 0 46 0 17 contents of dried plant shoots mean s d were far above values that are indicative of suboptimal growth i e 0 75 and 0 07 for n and p respectively gerloff 1975 this indicates that primary production under dominance by submerged plants was likely not limited by n and p availability and can explain the observed net co2 uptake the free floating plant dominated state shows large variation in co2 fluxes among replicates within both temperature treatments this variation strongly exceeded that of the other two states figs 1c 5 3 4 combined ghg fluxes and water management implications all in all we show that the effect of warming on total ghg emissions from experimental ponds is greatest under dominance by free floating plants and smallest when submerged plants dominate fig 6 which can be mainly attributed to a differential temperature effect on methane ebullition when comparing the different states our findings suggest that the total ghg emissions decline going from free floating plant to algae to submerged plant dominated state these results can have major implications as climate warming can both enhance ch4 production rates aben et al 2017 davidson et al 2018 marotta et al 2014 and favor free floating plant or phytoplankton dominance over submerged plant dominance meerhoff et al 2022 our results indicate that ch4 emissions may be enhanced more than expected based on direct temperature effects alone in our systems the enhanced ch4 emissions were not offset by an increase in co2 uptake hence our findings suggest that the combined effect of warming and displacement of submerged plants by algae or free floating plants exacerbates the increase in ghg emissions this indicates a positive feed back loop in which enhanced ghg emissions accelerate climate warming fig 7 notably different plant traits e g having roots that enable p uptake from sediments and the ability to use hco3 as c source not only affect ghg emission and uptake but also the resources available to the plants disentangling the direct and indirect plant effects on warming induced changes in ghg emissions therefore remains complex the fact that ghg emissions were lowest in the submerged plant dominated state both under control and warmed conditions may have major implications for water management across the world water managers target dominance by submerged plants as it generally coincides with higher water quality clear water higher biodiversity and a broader range of ecosystem services janssen et al 2021 this generally requires a combination of costly management strategies to maintain this ecosystem state e g external and internal nutrient load reduction fish community manipulation and or harvesting free floating plants hilt et al 2018 smolders et al 2006 the benefits of mitigating ghg emissions by the restoration of submerged vegetation fig 7 can provide additional leverage and even outweigh their costs downing et al 2021 as the measures may eventually result in a situation beneficial from an ecological societal and climate perspective 4 conclusions shifts from submerged plant to algae or free floating plant dominance may increase the magnitude and temperature sensitivity of ghg emissions from shallow aquatic ecosystems this may trigger a positive feedback loop as climate change is expected to enhance shifts to algae or free floating plant dominance ch4 ebullition was the most important ghg emission pathway both in terms of emission magnitude and its sensitivity to experimental warming hence we stress the need for accurate quantification of ch4 ebullition at high spatiotemporal scales as well as technological advances that ease the quantification of ch4 bubble fluxes to the atmosphere in floating plant beds restoration of submerged vegetation may limit increases in ghg emissions due to climate change credit authorship contribution statement ralf c h aben

15386,microplastics pollution is an emerging environmental concern however there are almost no mps numerical simulation studies in the yangtze estuary which is considered as the largest plastic export in the world and quantitative simulation is not carried out in the existing models therefore completing quantitative simulation and exploring different patterns of mps transport are the main objectives of this study in addition the concentration distribution and risk of mps are also analyzed mass number method is proposed to quantitatively simulate microplastics concentration in feb and may with errors of less than 18 compared with sediment flocculation and settling transport independent floating transport is more susceptible to surface currents resulting in increased beaching and more inhomogeneous concentration distribution meanwhile under the influence of current local topography and salt wedge the mps perform linear motion and clockwise spiral motion inside and outside the estuary and rapidly form a hot spot on the southeastern part of chongming island and 57 to 90 of mps are beached or settled inside the estuary especially on the north shore therefore mps risk in some sensitive targets should be concerned according to risk assessment results our results break the space time limit and explore the fate of mps in the yangtze estuary and provide new idea and concern of mps numerical simulation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics quantitative simulation transport patterns pollution risk data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as early as the 1970s humans have discovered the existence of microplastics mps 5 mm in the ocean carpente et al 1972 the fifth united nations environment assembly held in 2022 have established the first global treaty to tackle plastic pollution plastic debris is now ubiquitous throughout both marine and freshwater environment ling et al 2017 mps take advantage of huge specific surface area and hydrophobic functional groups absorbing dissolved organic matter and they are easily ingested by marine organisms such as zooplankton invertebrates and fish and then pass and accumulate along food chain through predatory activities derraik 2002 zhang et al 2020 farrell and nelson 2013 subsequently contaminated microplastics not only have toxic effects on organisms but also pose immeasurable potential risks to ecosystem and human castelvetro et al 2020 derraik 2002 numerical simulation studies of mps have been carried out in only a few estuaries coasts and bays in the world a dynamic study of mps along the coast of south africa found that different destinations for high density and low density mps collins and hermes 2019 the study in the arabian northwest persian gulf has showed that wind condition has a significant impact on the transport and distribution of mps alosairi et al 2020 the study in jervis bay has found that relative to turbulent dispersion and washing off mps fates are more sensitive to mps dynamical properties in particular plastic density and biofilm properties iwasaki et al 2017 the simulation of mps in delaware bay has indicated that the buoyant particles created hot spots within hours cohen et al 2019 in china a short term mps simulation has been carried out in lai zhou bay ding et al 2019 previous study focused on changes in particles trajectories under the influence of weather and mps dynamics but the chemical composition of mps is not considered it is worth noting that the chemical composition of mps is diverse and significantly affects the transport pattern of mps he et al 2021 lots of research have been shown that the type of mps can determine the pattern of settlement individual or aggregation with suspended sediment due to different aggregation barrier andersen et al 2021 kaiser et al 2017 li et al 2019 what s more previous simulation studies only focused on the trajectories thus a quantitative simulation of mps for different chemical compositions is presented in this study around 51 of global plastic is produced in asia mai et al 2020 the yangtze river the largest river in asia is considered to be the largest plastic export river to the ocean in all existing modeling studies schmidt et al 2018 however there is no study on numerical simulation of mps in the yangtze estuary therefore the aims of the present study are as follows 1 based on previous field sampling a quantitative simulation of mps concentration mpc is implemented 2 different simulations for mps with different chemical compositions is performed 3 the characteristics of mpc distribution are analyzed 4 risk analysis of mps in sensitive areas is performed 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the yangtze river located in the subtropical monsoon climate is the third longest and fifth largest river in terms of discharge volume 900km3yr 1 in the world wang et al 2020 the yangtze river receives a large number of materials from a drainage area of 1 8 106km2 encompassing 1 6 of china feng et al 2014 due to the prosperous economy and dense population the annual use of agricultural plastic film in the yangtze river basin is about 610 000 tons which is significantly higher than that in other basins according to china environment statistics yearbook stats gov cn and due to the covid 19 pandemic disposable surgical masks have also become a non negligible plastic pollution especially in the densely populated yangtze river basin shen et al 2021 therefore the yangtze river is considered to be the largest plastic export river to the ocean schmidt et al 2018 what s more a generally increasing trend of mps abundance from upstream to downstream is identified which is attributed to the geographical and anthropogenic factors feng et al 2014 yuan et al 2022 he et al 2021 fig 1 b through the investigate in downstream the abundance of mps in lakes and estuary is significantly higher than that in rivers li et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 fig 1b the abundance of mps in estuary and ocean is 4137 2461 5 and 0 167 0 138 n m3 respectively which indicates that the estuary is filter of mps

1c these animal refuges are established to protect endangered species such as chinese sturgeon paddlefish and migratory birds that occur most frequently in spring zeng et al 2021 the freshwater resource and biodiversity of the yangtze estuary make the research on mps in this region of great value 2 2 data collection the model terrain and bathymetric data is provided by taile maps http www

hydrology and water resources survey bureau of yangtze estuary since the scope of chongming district is almost the same as that of the yangtze estuary meteorological data for simulation which were measured in chongming district involving daily average wind speed and direction precipitation evaporation and temperature comes from national centers for environmental information https www ncei noaa gov maps daily and wheat a databases http www wheata cn monitoring cross sections are shown in fig 1 c and their details are provided by previous research wang et al 2019 2020 zeng et al the salinity is measured by ion chromatography and conforms to the standard sl86 1994 the water temperature is measured by a thermometer and conforms to national standard gb t 13 195 1991 and the suspended solid concentration ssc is measured by the gravimetric method and conforms to the national standard gb t11901 1989 2 3 simulated mps determination based on our bibliographic search there are only nine studies relative to the distribution and abundance of mps in water of the yangtze estuary in sciencedirect database the sampling tools especially the sieve pore size have significant impact on the mpc dubaish and liebezeit 2013 the average abundance of mps detected by 32 μm and 70 μm steel screens in wet season is 4137 3 2461 5 n m3 and 231 182 n m3 respectively which are significantly difference xu et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 water season and rainfall also affect mpc williams and simmons 1999 the field detection of abundance of mps of the yangtze estuary in feb may and jul has shown that the mpc in the dry season is significantly higher than that in wet season zhao et al 2019 the shape material size and color of mps are also the focus of research li et al 2021 almost all studies have shown that the mps in yangtze estuary are mainly fibrous 77 8 91 6 followed by fragments 15 1 li et al 2020 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 zhao et al 2014 what s more the mps detected in the yangtze estuary are mainly polyethylene pe 82 4 and polypropylene pp 9 1 the high density mps are mainly polyvinyl chloride pvc 6 5 xu et al 2018 mps with particle size smaller than 1 mm account for 68 2 82 3 and mps with particle size of 0 5 1 mm account for 67 fig 2 a however the lack of a uniform standard for the color of mps has led to large difference between research results fig 2b based on the above we generalize the mps in the yangtze estuary into fibrous particles with length and diameter of 0 8 mm and 100 μm respectively chubarenko et al 2016 meanwhile since pe mp pp mp and pvc mp account for 84 5 9 1 and 6 5 in the yangtze estuary we choose these three types of mps for simulation 2 4 numerical model experiment 2 4 1 simulation scheme a variety of precious species gather at the yangtze estuary from mar to jun every year to lay eggs raise young forage and inhabit therefore this period is called biological sensitive period fig 3 a especially april 15th to may 15th each year is the common residence period of endangered species chinese sturgeon and migration birds therefore we select this period to simulate the concentration distribution of three types of mps and analyze the risk in the sensitive areas moreover in order to ensure the accuracy of simulation we simulate the mpc in feb and may 2017 and compare the results with the measured data in previous literature zhao et al 2019 we consider the wind speed precipitation and evaporation as the meteorological condition fig 3b and c the simulation year is 2017 2 4 2 model selection aggregation behavior including homogeneous and heterogeneous aggregation is an important feature of plastic transport processes besseling et al 2017 compared with nano plastics the homogeneous aggregation of mps is difficult wang et al 2021 more than that the probability of heterogeneous aggregation of mps is much higher than that of homogeneous aggregation long et al 2015 singh et al 2019 mps biofouling and suspended sediment flocculation are two main ways of heterogeneous aggregation long et al 2015 long et al 2017 the chemical composition of mps significantly affects heterogeneous aggregation behavior biofilms are observed on the surface of pp mps within several days lagarde et al 2016 in high turbidity estuarine and coastal environment pvc mps readily flocculate with fine grained natural suspended sediment andersen et al 2021 huffer et al 2017 li et al 2019 pohl et al 2020 however as the result of aggregation barrier fibrous pe mps not only hardly flocculate with sediment but also are difficult to be bio fouled lagarde et al 2016 li et al 2019 fibrous and spherical pe mps retain in the euphotic zone for 6 8 months and 10 15 years respectively chubarenko et al 2016 kaiser et al 2017 based on above statement and density of three types of mps fig 4 pe mp is considered as drifting particle with zero sinking velocity without heterogeneous aggregation pp mp is considered as drifting particle whose settling velocity varies with biofilm growth pvc mp is considered as particle transported by flocculation with fine grained suspended sediment 16 μm pe mps and pp mps are independent settling particles and pvc mps are flocculated particles although this is not absolute the main possible transport patterns of these three types of mps are used to explore the difference of different transport patterns there are lots of uncertainties of resuspended and aging processes of mps zhang 2017 kowalski et al 2016 therefore the numerical simulation of mps rarely considers these processes in this study there periods one month each are selected for mps simulation since the aging of mps is a very slow process it may have little effect on the results in this study kowalski et al 2016 welden and cowie 2017 meanwhile although this simplification may bring some inaccuracies atwood believes that a simplified approach is preferable to setting an arbitrary factor atwood et al 2019 therefore these processes are not considered in the model but these processes need to be explored according to experiment in the future to improve simulation accuracy 2 4 3 behavior parameterization the lagrangian tracking model is implemented to simulate the transport of three types of mps for independent settling particles mps behavior mainly depends on three characteristics density shape and size chubarenko et al 2016 khatmullina and isachenko 2017 kooi et al 2017 several studies suggest that biofouling can be visible after several days weeks kooi et al 2017 biofouling of mps is a complex process affected by various factors such as algal concentration light and salinity kaiser et al 2017 and is rarely considered in other simulation studies however in order to gain insight into the importance of this process the empirical value in jervis bay is used for the biofouling rate 5 10 4 mm day jalon rojas et al 2019 for the settling velocity of fibrous mps both models proposed by khatmullina et al and waldschlager et al overestimate the settling velocity with average errors of 74 1 and 34 3 respectively and the model proposed by dioguardi et al underestimate the settling velocity with an average error of 64 5 compared with these models the model proposed by zhang et al can better estimate the settling velocity of the fibrous with an average error of 18 8 dioguardi et al 2018 khatmullina and isachenko 2017 waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 zhang and choi 2022 meanwhile the formula is developed for drag coefficient and settling velocity of non spherical particles zhu and zeng 2016 thus fibrous mps settling velocity 1 c d 58 58 a s f 0 1936 r e 0 8273 2 a s f d l d s d i 3 r e u t d e q ϑ 4 c d 4 3 d e q v 3 d e q 2 u t 2 ρ m ρ w ρ w g 5 d e q 4 d l d i π 6 v d e q v 3

biofouling pp mps the initial conditions of mps need to be considered when biofouling mps are simulated that means not all mps are clean when released since biofilm growth is measured in days we classified mps into 31 contaminated states for sediment flocculated particles the presence of mps has no significant effect on the dispersion of suspended sediment andersen et al 2021 therefore the transport of pvc mps is simulated by simulating the diffusion of fine grained sediment 16 μm due to the lack of research on the distribution law of mps in the solid and liquid phases the model simplifies the positive correlation between the amount of pvc mps and concentration of fine grained sediment form fine grained sediment flux and mps flux in xlj it is obtained that each kilogram of fine grained sediment 16 μm contains about 0 023 g mps the suspended sediment is divided into four fractions 16 μm 16 32 μm 32 64 μm 64 μm according to the content of sediment of different fractions gao et al 2018 2 4 4 governing equations 2 4 4 1 water current simulation the water current is simulated by hydrological model of mike 21 the hydrodynamic control module equations are in dhi 2011a 2 4 4 2 sediment transport simulation since resuspended process is not considered the settling process is focused suspended sediment transportation is simulated in fraction groups with low concentration of suspended sediment due to the low probability of collision between cohesive particles it is a possibility to give a rough estimate of the settling velocity of a single free particle through stokes

random walk which is derived from the hydrodynamic model dhi 2011d 2 5 mathematical analysis method 2 5 1 quantitative evaluation of mpc the average mps fluxes of surface water in the yangtze estuary in spring and winter in 2017 are 45 4n m3and 83n m3 respectively zhao et al 2019 based on measured flow the release of mps per second in may and feb 2017 is 31114n and 24983n respectively the huge release quantity of mps is the difficulty of numerical quantitative simulation according to experiments the average mass of mps is 3 3 10 5 g zhao et al 2019 assuming that the mass of a single mp remains unchanged a quantitative simulation method for mps based on the mass number m n relationship is proposed at present almost only the surface water and sediment of the yangtze estuary have been carried out field sampling and measurement therefore we implement numerical simulation research on mps for surface water the relationship between mpc and mass concentration of mps 15 m p c m 10 6 w m where m is the mass concentration of mps which is obtained by averaging the values of each grid in one region w is the surface water coefficient referring to 30 cm depth which is 0 022 in winter and spring zhao et al 2019 m is the average mass of mps 3 3 10 5 g in addition two methods hi and pli are used to assess the risk of mps and the specific calculation methods are in the appendix yin et al 2021 xu et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance the model area is 4 08 104 km2 including four inflow boundaries yangtze river qiantang river huangpu river zhoushan river and three outflow boundaries south of yellow sea east china sea and pacific ocean in order to ensure the accuracy of model we give a total of 6494 nodes and 10 588 triangular elements for the modeling area and set 60 s as the calculation time step of the model the cfl courant friedrich levy number is less than 0 8 to meet the requirement of model stability the hydrodynamic and sediment parameters are set according to wang et al 2020 zeng et al 2021 the kolmogorov smirnov k s test relative coefficient r2 and relative error e are adopted to judge the accuracy of model according to the flow and ssc data measured in xlj fig 5 b and c this process ensures the accuracy of the simulation environment since almost all mps in the surface water of the yangtze estuary are pe mps zhao et al 2014 the simulated concentrations of pe mps in dry season feb and wet season may in 2017 are used to compare with measured data from zhao et al in same periods zhao et al 2019 to complete quantitative simulation using m n method and verify simulation accuracy the yangtze estuary and adjacent sea area are divided into eight parts fig 6 a the total mps concentration tmpc in a b and c are 545 n m3 254 n m3 and 131 n m3 in feb respectively and the tmpc in a b and c are 484 n m3 462 n m3 and 177 n m3 in may respectively these are much higher than measured values fig 6a the reason is that the beaching of mps is not considered this phenomenon is also emphasized in the study of the sea of japan iwasaki et al 2017 and the simulated study in marine around south africa have indicated that half of the sewage outlets have more than 90 of mps beached collins and hermes 2019 xiong et al 2019 also have found that a considerable number of mps from the large river catchment do not reach the sea when beaching of mps is considered the suspended mps concentration smpc in a b and c are 111 n m3 107 n m3 and 52 n m3 in feb respectively and the smpc in a b and c are 64 n m3 52 n m3 and 36 n m3 in may respectively the average errors between the measured and simulated values in feb and may are 17 6 and 16 9 in the estuary respectively the beaching rate of mps in the estuary are around 73 6 and 83 8 in feb and may respectively fig 6b in the adjacent sea area almost no mps beaching occurs the simulated mpc in e f g and h are 41 n m3 123 n m3 188 n m3 and 65 n m3 in feb respectively and the simulated mpc in e f g and h are 74 n m3 100 n m3 145 n m3 and 72 n m3 in may respectively the simulated smpc in adjacent sea area is shown in fig 6b the average errors between the measured and simulated values in feb and may are 10 6 and 13 4 in adjacent sea area respectively fig 6b compared with other regions the errors in b c e and h are more significant this may be due to the existence of numerous non point and point sources of mps along the southeastern coast of china and yangtze estuary luo et al 2019 especially in may since the qiantang river is in the flood season and taiwan s warm current is strong lian et al 2016 it may carry a huge number of mps into adjacent sea area leading to simulated smpc significantly lower than measured smpc ocean current is an important source of mps genc et al 2020 both the measured and simulated results indicate that compared with dry season feb the mps are more likely to disperse in flood season may leading to high smpc in e and h it is worth noting that the peak of smpc in may shift to the south k point in the research of zhao et al 2019 two factors likely explain the southward shift of the peak of smpc in may first the strong taiwan s warm current carries mps into the southern adjacent sea area of yangtze estuary fig 6a second the temporary surge in mps abundance is formed due to wave eddy current and other reasons resulting in deviation of field measurement results schmidt et al 2018 van der hal et al 2017 the second hypothesis is based on the measured smpc results of liu et al in june 2019 which showed that the peak of smpc was still located in g liu 2020 since the smpc is obtained in dense grids and mps form highly dispersed and polyphasic suspensions upon into waters it is normal to detect some extreme values which are not found in field survey and some extreme values only occur in a few grids fig 6b compared to previous studies only on the trajectory of mps simantiris et al 2022 the m n method achieve the quantitative simulation with error less than 18 3 2 different transport patterns simulation three types of mps are simulated in biological sensitive period apr 15 to may 15 pe and pvc are only beached while pp is not only beached but also settled fig 7 a the beaching ratio of pe pp and pvc are 88 6 69 6 and 84 6 respectively and the settlement ratio of pp is 9 8 thus the sedimentation and sediment flocculation of mps reduce the beaching of mps pp in suspension is observed to spread more slowly compared to pe and pvc forming a smaller contamination area with smaller concentrations in the e and h regions that maybe because vertical profile velocity is higher in the surface and lower in the bottom due to the bottom friction force the result shows that the settlement can weaken the mps transport effect of the tide which means the horizontal diffusion of mps is affected by the variation of vertical profile velocity yin et al 2022 the tmpc ratios of pe mp pp mp and pvc mp between b and c are 2 98 2 5 and 1 45 respectively and the coefficient of variation of tmpc of pe mps pp mps and pvc mps among eight regions are 0 92 0 79 and 0 73 respectively figs 7b and 8 b these indicate that the concentration distribution of floating mps varies greatly in space the study in delaware bay also have indicated that the concentration of floating mps varied greatly in space due to surface circulation cohen et al 2019 compared with pe mps pp mps are less affected by surface circulation as the result of the continuous settlement the concept of sediment inertia can well explain the relatively uniform concentration of pvc in space that is the huge inertia of suspended solid causes its transport to be relatively less susceptible to wind and current effects pizzuto et al 2014 we also observe that the mps flocculated with suspended solid have the widest diffusion range in fig 7a some studies have found that the suspended solid can enhance the mps stability of mps in water column andersen et al 2021 singh et al 2019 which can also explain this phenomenon overall during biological sensitive period the tmpc in yangtze estuary is around 4 times that of the adjacent sea area in the yangtze estuary salt wedge exists where salt and fresh water meet this result may suggest that the salt wedge acts as a barrier for movement of mps the same phenomenon is also observed in rio de la plata acha et al 2003 if only the suspended mps are considered fig 8b the average smpc in yangtze estuary is about 74n m3 which is lower than that in adjacent sea area 104n m3 this is consistent with the field survey results zhao et al 2019 this indicates that lots of mps are beached or settled in the estuary especially on the north shore of the estuary and the north branch d although different transport patterns have little effect on the location of mps aggregation areas floating transported pe is more susceptible to current resulting in higher beaching ratio and forming a more inhomogeneous concentration distribution compared with pvc transported with sediment flocculation and pp settled continuously additionally the settlement can weaken the mps transport effect of the tide the risk of mps in sensitive objectives in the estuary should be noticed 3 3 the distribution of mps concentration during all simulation periods it takes around 3 5 days for three types of mps to enter the adjacent sea area then almost all the mps from b rapidly gather in the southeast of chongming island g and form a hot spot mps stay in g for a long time around 7 days mps begin to disperse to the seas in the northwest and southeast under the action of spring tides a stable mps pollution range is formed after around 15 days in addition the particle trajectory diagram shows that the mps reciprocate in a straight line in the estuary and clockwise spiraled in the adjacent sea area fig 8a in the yangtze estuary the inner part of the estuary is reciprocating flow while the water flow in the adjacent sea is clockwise under the observation by li et al 2017 thus the hydrodynamic conditions affect particle diffusion trajectories the distribution of tmpc in three periods is similar figs 7 s1 when mps enter the estuary more mps flow into b resulting in a significant higher tmpc in b than in c that maybe because runoff in the bei gang b is greater than in the nan gang c the flow field is an essential factor in the distribution of mps liu et al 2021 meanwhile in the yangtze estuary under the influence of geostrophic deflection the north bank with low angle that is more likely to cause mps beaching than south bank with steep angle fig 5a this phenomenon also be observed in the são vincente estuary brazil cordeiro and costa 2010 additionally the narrowing of north branch d also leads to more beaching of mps these phenomena imply that local topography influence the mps behavior in addition the hot spot of mps locates in the southeast of chongming island overlapping the location of the estuarine turbidity maximum and salt wedge salinity front this coincidence is also observed in the guadalquivir estuary and the delaware bay bermudez et al 2021 cohen et al 2019 this maybe because the energy dissipation of ebb and flow and the confluence of salt and fresh water occur at this position it is worth noting that the runoff is too weak in the dry season which leads to salt water flowing back into a through d which may cause the tmpc of a is high in february these results indicate that hydrodynamic conditions and topography are closely related to the distribution of tmpc these rules have significance for judging the distribution of mps concentration in other waters 3 4 risk assessment there are mainly three reservoirs and three animal refuges in the estuary fig 1 in the biological sensitive period the mps form some high concentration areas compared with the ch and qcs reservoirs the dfxs reservoir on the north shore is more affected by mps in addition to concentration the chemical composition affects the toxic effects of mps zhang et al 2022 in order to quantify the risk of mps in sensitive objectives hi and pli are calculated according to formulas 1 4 in the appendix fig 9 hi focuses on assessing risk from the chemical composition of mps while pli focuses on assessing risk from concentration pvc mp is regarded as particle with much higher pollution risk than pe mp and pp mp based on hi value we should focus on the conservation of species in syecs and scdnn such as chinese sturgeon and some migration birds however based on pli value we should focus on the risk of water use especially in dfxs reservoir which is located on the north shore fig 1 at present there is no comprehensive and fixed standard for assessing the risk of mps pollution common indicators are one sided therefore it is necessary to establish standards that can comprehensively reflect the risk of mps pollution 4 conclusion in this study based on the previous sampling investigation the first numerical simulation of mps of the yangtze estuary which is considered as the largest plastic export is carried out the quantitative simulation errors of different water seasons are both below 18 which indicates the accuracy of simulation the three types of mps transport shows that floating transported pe is more susceptible to surface currents beaching and forming more inhomogeneous concentration distribution compared with pvc transported with sediment flocculation and pp settled continuously during all simulation periods under the influence of surface current local topography and salt wedge high concentration of mps is formed in the southeast of chongming island north bank and the north branch about 57 90 of mps are settled or beached in the estuary especially on the north shore thus the mps risk is noticed during the biological sensitive period hi focusing on the chemical composition of mps indicates that the conservation of species in syecs and scdnn should be considered while pli focusing on mpc indicates that the water safety of the dfxs reservoir should be considered our results explore the fate of mps in the yangtze estuary however pollution sources within and near the yangtze estuary and the ocean current also affect the mpc meanwhile the resuspension aging biofouling and solid liquid distribution of mps should be further studied to improve the simulation accuracy declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this work was supported by the major science and technology program for water pollution

15386,microplastics pollution is an emerging environmental concern however there are almost no mps numerical simulation studies in the yangtze estuary which is considered as the largest plastic export in the world and quantitative simulation is not carried out in the existing models therefore completing quantitative simulation and exploring different patterns of mps transport are the main objectives of this study in addition the concentration distribution and risk of mps are also analyzed mass number method is proposed to quantitatively simulate microplastics concentration in feb and may with errors of less than 18 compared with sediment flocculation and settling transport independent floating transport is more susceptible to surface currents resulting in increased beaching and more inhomogeneous concentration distribution meanwhile under the influence of current local topography and salt wedge the mps perform linear motion and clockwise spiral motion inside and outside the estuary and rapidly form a hot spot on the southeastern part of chongming island and 57 to 90 of mps are beached or settled inside the estuary especially on the north shore therefore mps risk in some sensitive targets should be concerned according to risk assessment results our results break the space time limit and explore the fate of mps in the yangtze estuary and provide new idea and concern of mps numerical simulation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics quantitative simulation transport patterns pollution risk data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as early as the 1970s humans have discovered the existence of microplastics mps 5 mm in the ocean carpente et al 1972 the fifth united nations environment assembly held in 2022 have established the first global treaty to tackle plastic pollution plastic debris is now ubiquitous throughout both marine and freshwater environment ling et al 2017 mps take advantage of huge specific surface area and hydrophobic functional groups absorbing dissolved organic matter and they are easily ingested by marine organisms such as zooplankton invertebrates and fish and then pass and accumulate along food chain through predatory activities derraik 2002 zhang et al 2020 farrell and nelson 2013 subsequently contaminated microplastics not only have toxic effects on organisms but also pose immeasurable potential risks to ecosystem and human castelvetro et al 2020 derraik 2002 numerical simulation studies of mps have been carried out in only a few estuaries coasts and bays in the world a dynamic study of mps along the coast of south africa found that different destinations for high density and low density mps collins and hermes 2019 the study in the arabian northwest persian gulf has showed that wind condition has a significant impact on the transport and distribution of mps alosairi et al 2020 the study in jervis bay has found that relative to turbulent dispersion and washing off mps fates are more sensitive to mps dynamical properties in particular plastic density and biofilm properties iwasaki et al 2017 the simulation of mps in delaware bay has indicated that the buoyant particles created hot spots within hours cohen et al 2019 in china a short term mps simulation has been carried out in lai zhou bay ding et al 2019 previous study focused on changes in particles trajectories under the influence of weather and mps dynamics but the chemical composition of mps is not considered it is worth noting that the chemical composition of mps is diverse and significantly affects the transport pattern of mps he et al 2021 lots of research have been shown that the type of mps can determine the pattern of settlement individual or aggregation with suspended sediment due to different aggregation barrier andersen et al 2021 kaiser et al 2017 li et al 2019 what s more previous simulation studies only focused on the trajectories thus a quantitative simulation of mps for different chemical compositions is presented in this study around 51 of global plastic is produced in asia mai et al 2020 the yangtze river the largest river in asia is considered to be the largest plastic export river to the ocean in all existing modeling studies schmidt et al 2018 however there is no study on numerical simulation of mps in the yangtze estuary therefore the aims of the present study are as follows 1 based on previous field sampling a quantitative simulation of mps concentration mpc is implemented 2 different simulations for mps with different chemical compositions is performed 3 the characteristics of mpc distribution are analyzed 4 risk analysis of mps in sensitive areas is performed 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the yangtze river located in the subtropical monsoon climate is the third longest and fifth largest river in terms of discharge volume 900km3yr 1 in the world wang et al 2020 the yangtze river receives a large number of materials from a drainage area of 1 8 106km2 encompassing 1 6 of china feng et al 2014 due to the prosperous economy and dense population the annual use of agricultural plastic film in the yangtze river basin is about 610 000 tons which is significantly higher than that in other basins according to china environment statistics yearbook stats gov cn and due to the covid 19 pandemic disposable surgical masks have also become a non negligible plastic pollution especially in the densely populated yangtze river basin shen et al 2021 therefore the yangtze river is considered to be the largest plastic export river to the ocean schmidt et al 2018 what s more a generally increasing trend of mps abundance from upstream to downstream is identified which is attributed to the geographical and anthropogenic factors feng et al 2014 yuan et al 2022 he et al 2021 fig 1 b through the investigate in downstream the abundance of mps in lakes and estuary is significantly higher than that in rivers li et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 fig 1b the abundance of mps in estuary and ocean is 4137 2461 5 and 0 167 0 138 n m3 respectively which indicates that the estuary is filter of mps zhao et al 2014 there are three reservoirs and three animal refuges in the estuary and two animal refuges with different conservation objectives overlap each other in the east of chongming island fig 1c these animal refuges are established to protect endangered species such as chinese sturgeon paddlefish and migratory birds that occur most frequently in spring zeng et al 2021 the freshwater resource and biodiversity of the yangtze estuary make the research on mps in this region of great value 2 2 data collection the model terrain and bathymetric data is provided by taile maps http www

hydrology and water resources survey bureau of yangtze estuary since the scope of chongming district is almost the same as that of the yangtze estuary meteorological data for simulation which were measured in chongming district involving daily average wind speed and direction precipitation evaporation and temperature comes from national centers for environmental information https www ncei noaa gov maps daily and wheat a databases http www wheata cn monitoring cross sections are shown in fig 1 c and their details are provided by previous research wang et al 2019 2020 zeng et al the salinity is measured by ion chromatography and conforms to the standard sl86 1994 the water temperature is measured by a thermometer and conforms to national standard gb t 13 195 1991 and the suspended solid concentration ssc is measured by the gravimetric method and conforms to the national standard gb t11901 1989 2 3 simulated mps determination based on our bibliographic search there are only nine studies relative to the distribution and abundance of mps in water of the yangtze estuary in sciencedirect database the sampling tools especially the sieve pore size have significant impact on the mpc dubaish and liebezeit 2013 the average abundance of mps detected by 32 μm and 70 μm steel screens in wet season is 4137 3 2461 5 n m3 and 231 182 n m3 respectively which are significantly difference xu et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 water season and rainfall also affect mpc williams and simmons 1999 the field detection of abundance of mps of the yangtze estuary in feb may and jul has shown that the mpc in the dry season is significantly higher than that in wet season zhao et al 2019 the shape material size and color of mps are also the focus of research li et al 2021 almost all studies have shown that the mps in yangtze estuary are mainly fibrous 77 8 91 6 followed by fragments 15 1 li et al 2020 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 zhao et al 2014 what s more the mps detected in the yangtze estuary are mainly polyethylene pe 82 4 and polypropylene pp 9 1 the high density mps are mainly polyvinyl chloride pvc 6 5 xu et al 2018 mps with particle size smaller than 1 mm account for 68 2 82 3 and mps with particle size of 0 5 1 mm account for 67 fig 2 a however the lack of a uniform standard for the color of mps has led to large difference between research results fig 2b based on the above we generalize the mps in the yangtze estuary into fibrous particles with length and diameter of 0 8 mm and 100 μm respectively chubarenko et al 2016 meanwhile since pe mp pp mp and pvc mp account for 84 5 9 1 and 6 5 in the yangtze estuary we choose these three types of mps for simulation 2 4 numerical model experiment 2 4 1 simulation scheme a variety of precious species gather at the yangtze estuary from mar to jun every year to lay eggs raise young forage and inhabit therefore this period is called biological sensitive period fig 3 a especially april 15th to may 15th each year is the common residence period of endangered species chinese sturgeon and migration birds therefore we select this period to simulate the concentration distribution of three types of mps and analyze the risk in the sensitive areas moreover in order to ensure the accuracy of simulation we simulate the mpc in feb and may 2017 and compare the results with the measured data in previous literature zhao et al 2019 we consider the wind speed precipitation and evaporation as the meteorological condition fig 3b and c the simulation year is 2017 2 4 2 model selection aggregation behavior including homogeneous and heterogeneous aggregation is an important feature of plastic transport processes besseling et al 2017 compared with nano plastics the homogeneous aggregation of mps is difficult wang et al 2021 more than that the probability of heterogeneous aggregation of mps is much higher than that of homogeneous aggregation long et al 2015 singh et al 2019 mps biofouling and suspended sediment flocculation are two main ways of heterogeneous aggregation long et al 2015 long et al 2017 the chemical composition of mps significantly affects heterogeneous aggregation behavior biofilms are observed on the surface of pp mps within several days lagarde et al 2016 in high turbidity estuarine and coastal environment pvc mps readily flocculate with fine grained natural suspended sediment andersen et al 2021 huffer et al 2017 li et al 2019 pohl et al 2020 however as the result of aggregation barrier fibrous pe mps not only hardly flocculate with sediment but also are difficult to be bio fouled lagarde et al 2016 li et al 2019 fibrous and spherical pe mps retain in the euphotic zone for 6 8 months and 10 15 years respectively chubarenko et al 2016 kaiser et al 2017 based on above statement and density of three types of mps fig 4 pe mp is considered as drifting particle with zero sinking velocity without heterogeneous aggregation pp mp is considered as drifting particle whose settling velocity varies with biofilm growth pvc mp is considered as particle transported by flocculation with fine grained suspended sediment 16 μm pe mps and pp mps are independent settling particles and pvc mps are flocculated particles although this is not absolute the main possible transport patterns of these three types of mps are used to explore the difference of different transport patterns there are lots of uncertainties of resuspended and aging processes of mps zhang 2017 kowalski et al 2016 therefore the numerical simulation of mps rarely considers these processes in this study there periods one month each are selected for mps simulation since the aging of mps is a very slow process it may have little effect on the results in this study kowalski et al 2016 welden and cowie 2017 meanwhile although this simplification may bring some inaccuracies atwood believes that a simplified approach is preferable to setting an arbitrary factor atwood et al 2019 therefore these processes are not considered in the model but these processes need to be explored according to experiment in the future to improve simulation accuracy 2 4 3 behavior parameterization the lagrangian tracking model is implemented to simulate the transport of three types of mps for independent settling particles mps behavior mainly depends on three characteristics density shape and size chubarenko et al 2016 khatmullina and isachenko 2017 kooi et al 2017 several studies suggest that biofouling can be visible after several days weeks kooi et al 2017 biofouling of mps is a complex process affected by various factors such as algal concentration light and salinity kaiser et al 2017 and is rarely considered in other simulation studies however in order to gain insight into the importance of this process the empirical value in jervis bay is used for the biofouling rate 5 10 4 mm day jalon rojas et al 2019 for the settling velocity of fibrous mps both models proposed by khatmullina et al and waldschlager et al overestimate the settling velocity with average errors of 74 1 and 34 3 respectively and the model proposed by dioguardi et al underestimate the settling velocity with an average error of 64 5 compared with these models the model proposed by zhang et al can better estimate the settling velocity of the fibrous with an average error of 18 8 dioguardi et al 2018 khatmullina and isachenko 2017 waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 zhang and choi 2022 meanwhile the formula is developed for drag coefficient and settling velocity of non spherical particles zhu and zeng 2016 thus fibrous mps settling velocity 1 c d 58 58 a s f 0 1936 r e 0 8273 2 a s f d l d s d i 3 r e u t d e q ϑ 4 c d 4 3 d e q v 3 d e q 2 u t 2 ρ m ρ w ρ w g 5 d e q 4 d l d i π 6 v d e q v 3

biofouling pp mps the initial conditions of mps need to be considered when biofouling mps are simulated that means not all mps are clean when released since biofilm growth is measured in days we classified mps into 31 contaminated states for sediment flocculated particles the presence of mps has no significant effect on the dispersion of suspended sediment andersen et al 2021 therefore the transport of pvc mps is simulated by simulating the diffusion of fine grained sediment 16 μm due to the lack of research on the distribution law of mps in the solid and liquid phases the model simplifies the positive correlation between the amount of pvc mps and concentration of fine grained sediment form fine grained sediment flux and mps flux in xlj it is obtained that each kilogram of fine grained sediment 16 μm contains about 0 023 g mps the suspended sediment is divided into four fractions 16 μm 16 32 μm 32 64 μm 64 μm according to the content of sediment of different fractions gao et al 2018 2 4 4 governing equations 2 4 4 1 water current simulation the water current is simulated by hydrological model of mike 21 the hydrodynamic control module equations are in dhi 2011a 2 4 4 2 sediment transport simulation since resuspended process is not considered the settling process is focused suspended sediment transportation is simulated in fraction groups with low concentration of suspended sediment due to the low probability of collision between cohesive particles it is a possibility to give a rough estimate of the settling velocity of a single free particle through stokes

random walk which is derived from the hydrodynamic model dhi 2011d 2 5 mathematical analysis method 2 5 1 quantitative evaluation of mpc the average mps fluxes of surface water in the yangtze estuary in spring and winter in 2017 are 45 4n m3and 83n m3 respectively zhao et al 2019 based on measured flow the release of mps per second in may and feb 2017 is 31114n and 24983n respectively the huge release quantity of mps is the difficulty of numerical quantitative simulation according to experiments the average mass of mps is 3 3 10 5 g zhao et al 2019 assuming that the mass of a single mp remains unchanged a quantitative simulation method for mps based on the mass number m n relationship is proposed at present almost only the surface water and sediment of the yangtze estuary have been carried out field sampling and measurement therefore we implement numerical simulation research on mps for surface water the relationship between mpc and mass concentration of mps 15 m p c m 10 6 w m where m is the mass concentration of mps which is obtained by averaging the values of each grid in one region w is the surface water coefficient referring to 30 cm depth which is 0 022 in winter and spring zhao et al 2019 m is the average mass of mps 3 3 10 5 g in addition two methods hi and pli are used to assess the risk of mps and the specific calculation methods are in the appendix yin et al 2021 xu et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance the model area is 4 08 104 km2 including four inflow boundaries yangtze river qiantang river huangpu river zhoushan river and three outflow boundaries south of yellow sea east china sea and pacific ocean in order to ensure the accuracy of model we give a total of 6494 nodes and 10 588 triangular elements for the modeling area and set 60 s as the calculation time step of the model the cfl courant friedrich levy number is less than 0 8 to meet the requirement of model stability the hydrodynamic and sediment parameters are set according to wang et al 2020 zeng et al 2021 the kolmogorov smirnov k s test relative coefficient r2 and relative error e are adopted to judge the accuracy of model according to the flow and ssc data measured in xlj fig 5 b and c this process ensures the accuracy of the simulation environment since almost all mps in the surface water of the yangtze estuary are pe mps zhao et al 2014 the simulated concentrations of pe mps in dry season feb and wet season may in 2017 are used to compare with measured data from zhao et al in same periods zhao et al 2019 to complete quantitative simulation using m n method and verify simulation accuracy the yangtze estuary and adjacent sea area are divided into eight parts fig 6 a the total mps concentration tmpc in a b and c are 545 n m3 254 n m3 and 131 n m3 in feb respectively and the tmpc in a b and c are 484 n m3 462 n m3 and 177 n m3 in may respectively these are much higher than measured values fig 6a the reason is that the beaching of mps is not considered this phenomenon is also emphasized in the study of the sea of japan iwasaki et al 2017 and the simulated study in marine around south africa have indicated that half of the sewage outlets have more than 90 of mps beached collins and hermes 2019 xiong et al 2019 also have found that a considerable number of mps from the large river catchment do not reach the sea when beaching of mps is considered the suspended mps concentration smpc in a b and c are 111 n m3 107 n m3 and 52 n m3 in feb respectively and the smpc in a b and c are 64 n m3 52 n m3 and 36 n m3 in may respectively the average errors between the measured and simulated values in feb and may are 17 6 and 16 9 in the estuary respectively the beaching rate of mps in the estuary are around 73 6 and 83 8 in feb and may respectively fig 6b in the adjacent sea area almost no mps beaching occurs the simulated mpc in e f g and h are 41 n m3 123 n m3 188 n m3 and 65 n m3 in feb respectively and the simulated mpc in e f g and h are 74 n m3 100 n m3 145 n m3 and 72 n m3 in may respectively the simulated smpc in adjacent sea area is shown in fig 6b the average errors between the measured and simulated values in feb and may are 10 6 and 13 4 in adjacent sea area respectively fig 6b compared with other regions the errors in b c e and h are more significant this may be due to the existence of numerous non point and point sources of mps along the southeastern coast of china and yangtze estuary luo et al 2019 especially in may since the qiantang river is in the flood season and taiwan s warm current is strong lian et al 2016 it may carry a huge number of mps into adjacent sea area leading to simulated smpc significantly lower than measured smpc ocean current is an important source of mps genc et al 2020 both the measured and simulated results indicate that compared with dry season feb the mps are more likely to disperse in flood season may leading to high smpc in e and h it is worth noting that the peak of smpc in may shift to the south k point in the research of zhao et al 2019 two factors likely explain the southward shift of the peak of smpc in may first the strong taiwan s warm current carries mps into the southern adjacent sea area of yangtze estuary fig 6a second the temporary surge in mps abundance is formed due to wave eddy current and other reasons resulting in deviation of field measurement results schmidt et al 2018 van der hal et al 2017 the second hypothesis is based on the measured smpc results of liu et al in june 2019 which showed that the peak of smpc was still located in g liu 2020 since the smpc is obtained in dense grids and mps form highly dispersed and polyphasic suspensions upon into waters it is normal to detect some extreme values which are not found in field survey and some extreme values only occur in a few grids fig 6b compared to previous studies only on the trajectory of mps simantiris et al 2022 the m n method achieve the quantitative simulation with error less than 18 3 2 different transport patterns simulation three types of mps are simulated in biological sensitive period apr 15 to may 15 pe and pvc are only beached while pp is not only beached but also settled fig 7 a the beaching ratio of pe pp and pvc are 88 6 69 6 and 84 6 respectively and the settlement ratio of pp is 9 8 thus the sedimentation and sediment flocculation of mps reduce the beaching of mps pp in suspension is observed to spread more slowly compared to pe and pvc forming a smaller contamination area with smaller concentrations in the e and h regions that maybe because vertical profile velocity is higher in the surface and lower in the bottom due to the bottom friction force the result shows that the settlement can weaken the mps transport effect of the tide which means the horizontal diffusion of mps is affected by the variation of vertical profile velocity yin et al 2022 the tmpc ratios of pe mp pp mp and pvc mp between b and c are 2 98 2 5 and 1 45 respectively and the coefficient of variation of tmpc of pe mps pp mps and pvc mps among eight regions are 0 92 0 79 and 0 73 respectively figs 7b and 8 b these indicate that the concentration distribution of floating mps varies greatly in space the study in delaware bay also have indicated that the concentration of floating mps varied greatly in space due to surface circulation cohen et al 2019 compared with pe mps pp mps are less affected by surface circulation as the result of the continuous settlement the concept of sediment inertia can well explain the relatively uniform concentration of pvc in space that is the huge inertia of suspended solid causes its transport to be relatively less susceptible to wind and current effects pizzuto et al 2014 we also observe that the mps flocculated with suspended solid have the widest diffusion range in fig 7a some studies have found that the suspended solid can enhance the mps stability of mps in water column andersen et al 2021 singh et al 2019 which can also explain this phenomenon overall during biological sensitive period the tmpc in yangtze estuary is around 4 times that of the adjacent sea area in the yangtze estuary salt wedge exists where salt and fresh water meet this result may suggest that the salt wedge acts as a barrier for movement of mps the same phenomenon is also observed in rio de la plata acha et al 2003 if only the suspended mps are considered fig 8b the average smpc in yangtze estuary is about 74n m3 which is lower than that in adjacent sea area 104n m3 this is consistent with the field survey results zhao et al 2019 this indicates that lots of mps are beached or settled in the estuary especially on the north shore of the estuary and the north branch d although different transport patterns have little effect on the location of mps aggregation areas floating transported pe is more susceptible to current resulting in higher beaching ratio and forming a more inhomogeneous concentration distribution compared with pvc transported with sediment flocculation and pp settled continuously additionally the settlement can weaken the mps transport effect of the tide the risk of mps in sensitive objectives in the estuary should be noticed 3 3 the distribution of mps concentration during all simulation periods it takes around 3 5 days for three types of mps to enter the adjacent sea area then almost all the mps from b rapidly gather in the southeast of chongming island g and form a hot spot mps stay in g for a long time around 7 days mps begin to disperse to the seas in the northwest and southeast under the action of spring tides a stable mps pollution range is formed after around 15 days in addition the particle trajectory diagram shows that the mps reciprocate in a straight line in the estuary and clockwise spiraled in the adjacent sea area fig 8a in the yangtze estuary the inner part of the estuary is reciprocating flow while the water flow in the adjacent sea is clockwise under the observation by li et al 2017 thus the hydrodynamic conditions affect particle diffusion trajectories the distribution of tmpc in three periods is similar figs 7 s1 when mps enter the estuary more mps flow into b resulting in a significant higher tmpc in b than in c that maybe because runoff in the bei gang b is greater than in the nan gang c the flow field is an essential factor in the distribution of mps liu et al 2021 meanwhile in the yangtze estuary under the influence of geostrophic deflection the north bank with low angle that is more likely to cause mps beaching than south bank with steep angle fig 5a this phenomenon also be observed in the são vincente estuary brazil cordeiro and costa 2010 additionally the narrowing of north branch d also leads to more beaching of mps these phenomena imply that local topography influence the mps behavior in addition the hot spot of mps locates in the southeast of chongming island overlapping the location of the estuarine turbidity maximum and salt wedge salinity front this coincidence is also observed in the guadalquivir estuary and the delaware bay bermudez et al 2021 cohen et al 2019 this maybe because the energy dissipation of ebb and flow and the confluence of salt and fresh water occur at this position it is worth noting that the runoff is too weak in the dry season which leads to salt water flowing back into a through d which may cause the tmpc of a is high in february these results indicate that hydrodynamic conditions and topography are closely related to the distribution of tmpc these rules have significance for judging the distribution of mps concentration in other waters 3 4 risk assessment there are mainly three reservoirs and three animal refuges in the estuary fig 1 in the biological sensitive period the mps form some high concentration areas compared with the ch and qcs reservoirs the dfxs reservoir on the north shore is more affected by mps in addition to concentration the chemical composition affects the toxic effects of mps zhang et al 2022 in order to quantify the risk of mps in sensitive objectives hi and pli are calculated according to formulas 1 4 in the appendix fig 9 hi focuses on assessing risk from the chemical composition of mps while pli focuses on assessing risk from concentration pvc mp is regarded as particle with much higher pollution risk than pe mp and pp mp based on hi value we should focus on the conservation of species in syecs and scdnn such as chinese sturgeon and some migration birds however based on pli value we should focus on the risk of water use especially in dfxs reservoir which is located on the north shore fig 1 at present there is no comprehensive and fixed standard for assessing the risk of mps pollution common indicators are one sided therefore it is necessary to establish standards that can comprehensively reflect the risk of mps pollution 4 conclusion in this study based on the previous sampling investigation the first numerical simulation of mps of the yangtze estuary which is considered as the largest plastic export is carried out the quantitative simulation errors of different water seasons are both below 18 which indicates the accuracy of simulation the three types of mps transport shows that floating transported pe is more susceptible to surface currents beaching and forming more inhomogeneous concentration distribution compared with pvc transported with sediment flocculation and pp settled continuously during all simulation periods under the influence of surface current local topography and salt wedge high concentration of mps is formed in the southeast of chongming island north bank and the north branch about 57 90 of mps are settled or beached in the estuary especially on the north shore thus the mps risk is noticed during the biological sensitive period hi focusing on the chemical composition of mps indicates that the conservation of species in syecs and scdnn should be considered while pli focusing on mpc indicates that the water safety of the dfxs reservoir should be considered our results explore the fate of mps in the yangtze estuary however pollution sources within and near the yangtze estuary and the ocean current also affect the mpc meanwhile the resuspension aging biofouling and solid liquid distribution of mps should be further studied to improve the simulation accuracy declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this work was supported by the major science and technology program for water pollution

15387,as one of the most effective expectorant class drugs ambroxol amb has been frequently used to treat acute and chronic bronchitis extensive use and human excretion result in the widespread occurrence of amb in wastewater herein we reported the photolysis of amb in aqueous solution upon 254 nm ultraviolet radiation uv254 spectroscopic characterization showed that 2 4 dibromoaniline dba moiety is the core chromophore of amb quantum yield of dba changed little at ph 4 0 9 0 however amb showed higher quantum yield at ph 8 0 both dba and amb have high photoreactivity which can be attributed to the heavy atom effect of bromine substituents the photolysis of amb occurred through photoreduction photoionization photonucleophilic substitution side chain cleavage and coupling reactions both amb and dba underwent debromination with yields reaching 80 under 3200 mj cm 2 uv fluence photo debromination occurred preferentially at the para position the presence of natural organic matter inhibited the photodegradation mainly due to the light screening effect the photolysis of amb was slightly enhanced in the presence of no3 likely due to radical induced oxidation bioluminescence inhibition assay revealed that photoproducts were not toxic the results show that uv254 radiation with fluences relevant to advanced oxidation processes was effective for the abatement of amb in wastewater however uv254 treatment of wastewater containing higher concentrations μg l 1 of amb should be done with caution because the released br can be converted to toxic brominated disinfection byproducts and bromate in subsequent oxidation process graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords ambroxol 2 4 dibromoaniline debromination photodegradation photolysis mechanisms photoproducts data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ambroxol 2 amino 3 5 dibromo n trans 4 hydroxy cyclohexy benzylamine amb is an expectorant class drug widely used to increase surfactant secretion in lung and to decrease mucus viscosity see chart 1 for molecular structure xu et al 2015 this drug is therefore widely used to treat and prevent acute and chronic bronchitis extensive use and human excretion result in the widespread occurrence of amb in raw wastewater wastewater effluent and surface water with concentrations up to 1047 89 1 4 9 2 9 and 7 8 1 3 ng l 1 respectively zhang et al 2020 trace organic contaminants trocs can undergo a series of physical chemical and biological transformations during wastewater treatment processes such as adsorption hydrolysis oxidation and methylation brown et al 2020 zhi et al 2021 these processes strongly affect the environmental fates and ecological risks of trocs eniola et al 2022 maculewicz et al 2022 previous studies have shown that amb has antioxidant properties and can quench many reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radical ho sun et al 2014 therefore advanced oxidation processes aops such as tio2 photocatalysis and radiolysis can effectively remove amb from aqueous solutions tamba and torreggiani 2001 tab et al 2021 however little is known about the transformation and fate of amb in many other water treatment unit processes such as chlorination ozonation and uv photolysis uv photolysis using low or medium pressure mercury lamps is widely applied to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater and drinking water cai et al 2022 rodríguez et al 2022 uv radiation can rapidly modify the genetic materials of water borne pathogens such as dna and rna through the dimerization of thymine cheng et al 2021 as a result uv radiation achieves higher disinfection efficiency as compared to chlorination and ozonation in addition uv treatment does not generate disinfection by products dbps such as trihalomethanes thms halogenated acetic acids haas and bromate bro3 which otherwise can be generated in chlorination and ozonation marron et al 2019 von gunten 2018 these byproducts often have carcinogenic and mutagenic effects and are strictly controlled by water industry yang et al 2019 srivastav et al 2020 benítez et al 2021 uv disinfection also bears other benefits since some trocs can absorb photons and undergo direct photolysis which reduces the possibility of their occurrence in natural aquatic environment some well known photolabile trocs include diclofenac ketoprofen triclosan n nitrosodimethylamine etc plumlee and reinhard 2007 salgado et al 2013 davis et al 2017 wang et al 2022 in addition to direct photolysis photosensitizers present in wastewater matrices including effluent organic matter efom nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 are capable of inducing indirect photolysis of trocs by generating photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris such as triplet excited state efom 3efom singlet oxygen 1o2 and ho lian et al 2017 the molecular structure of amb features a core of 2 4 dibromoaniline dba and a branched chain of 4 aminocyclohexanol separated by a methylene see chart 1 photobiological studies showed that uvb irradiation enhanced the response of patch testing to amb suggesting that the drug had photosensitivity fujimoto et al 2009 many brominated aromatic compounds have very high photochemical reactivity and debromination often occurs during the photolytic processes grabner and richard 2005 rayne et al 2009 typical examples include the brominated flame retardants tetrabromobisphenol a s as well as the odorant compound 2 4 6 tribromoanisole wang et al 2015 xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the high photoreactivity of brominated aromatic compounds is partly due to the heavy atom effect of br substituents it is well known that heavy atoms in particular br and i favor the intersystem crossing isc by accelerating the flip of spins as a result brominated aromatic compounds especially polybrominated derivatives are readily to generate triplet excited states upon radiation turro et al 2010 in addition bromine substituent is a good leaving group that is vulnerable toward photonucleophilic substitution sn ar or photoreduction guizzardi et al 2001 freccero et al 2003 the released bromide ion br is also an issue worthy of special attention in wastewater treatment this is because br can be oxidized by ozone o3 and hypochlorous acid hocl to generate reactive bromine species rbs such as br br2 broh and hobr these rbs then react with natural organic matter nom or other organic substances to produce brominated dbps br dbps e g bromoform bromoacetic acids and bro3 with carcinogenic and mutagenic risks deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2014 previous studies on the photochemical degradation of haloanilines including bromoanilines provide evidence that photo dehalogenation is a heterolytic process starting from the triplet state grabner and richard 2005 ratti et al 2015 in addition the photochemical transformation of haloanilines is strongly affected by the type number and location of halogen substituents othmen and boule 1999a 1999b othmen et al 2000 these findings provide valuable information for us to describe the photochemical behavior of amb however to the author s knowledge there is no research on the photolysis of amb in aqueous solution including both direct and indirect photolysis thus further research is still needed to gain a better understanding of the mechanistic aspects and to explore the application of uv radiation to remediate effluents containing haloaniline families of contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides davis et al 2017 carena et al 2018 in this study we attempted to reveal the photoreactivity of amb under 254 nm ultraviolet uv254 radiation uv254 was chosen because it is widely used for wastewater treatment wan et al 2020 firstly we studied the absorption properties of amb by spectroscopic characterization which confirmed that dba is the key chromophore responsible for the absorbance of amb we then compared the photolysis kinetics of amb and dba including photolysis rate constants and quantum yields under varying ph conditions in particular the debromination behavior and photolytic mechanism of amb have been deeply investigated by high resolution mass spectrometry hrms and ion chromatography ic analyses because photoproducts may have higher toxicity than their parent compounds buth et al 2009 we also evaluated the toxicity of amb photoproducts by bioluminescence inhibition assay finally we evaluated the effects of nom and no3 two important wastewater constituents on the photolysis of amb the conclusions obtained in this study are helpful to reveal the transformation and photofate of amb during uv254 treatment of wastewater e g hospital wastewater since halogenated aniline derivatives are also important raw materials of synthetic drugs and pesticides this study also provides insights into the fate of these substances upon uv254 radiation davis et al 2017 carena et al 2018 2 materials

shanghai bilon instrument co ltd equipped with a low pressure mercury lamp 15 w beijing institute of electric light source emitting predominantly 254 nm uv light the lamp was housed in a quartz cooling jacket connected to a bl t 1000s recirculating cooler to maintain the temperature at 20 1 the photon fluence rate was determined to be 1 9 10 9 e cm 2 s 1 which corresponds to a power output of 0 897 mw cm 2 using atrazine as an actinometer canonica et al 2008 detailed information for the calculation of photon fluence rate is provided in text s2 sm uv fluence mj cm 2 was calculated as the average photon fluence rate multiplied by the exposure time yuan et al 2009 the photoreactor was turn on for 15 min for lamp emission stabilization after that a series of uncapped cylindrical quartz

variation in toxicity through the photolysis of amb samples taken at different irradiation times were submitted to bioluminescence inhibition assay such assay monitors the changes of natural luminescence emitted by the luminescent bacterium p phosphoreum t3 spp in the presence of toxic substances freeze dried bacteria were obtained from the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences nanjing china after activation added with 2 nacl and incubation dilution with 3 nacl the bacteria were exposed to the irradiated solutions for 15 min at 25 c the bioluminescence intensity was recorded by an ensight multimode microplate reader coupled with kaleide workflow software perkinelmer ma usa eight replicate tests were performed for measuring the bioluminescence intensity of each irradiated sample 2 7 calculations the quantum yield φ mol e 1 of direct photolysis of amb and dba can be calculated by the following equation 1 φ d c d t e p 0 1 10 ε cl where c represents the concentration of target compound m ε represents the molar absorption coefficient of target compound at 254 nm m 1 cm 1 e p 0 represents the photon fluence rate of the low pressure mercury lamp e cm 2 s 1 and l represents the optical pathlength of the reaction tube cm in the presence of srnom we can normalize the direct photolysis rate constant of amb by light screening factor s λ li et al 2022 2 k

represents the beam attenuation coefficient cm 1 measured by the spectrophotometer l is well mixed depth of the water column 2 2 cm in our experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 uv vis absorption spectra fig 1 displays the uv vis absorption spectra of neutral aqueous solutions of amb and dba as can be seen the amb solution shows three absorption bands with peak wavelength λ max at 210 37 350 m 1 cm 1 245 10 170 m 1 cm 1 and 310 nm 2970 m 1 cm 1 respectively the first and second absorption bands e and k bands are derived from π π transition of the three conjugated double bonds of benzene ring fleming and williams 2019 the third absorption band b band is caused by the interaction between π π transition and benzene ring vibration fleming and williams 2019 it should be emphasized that the vibrational fine structure of b band was not observed because of interactions of solute with solvent in polar aqueous solution fleming and williams 2019 the absorption bands are significantly affected by the electronically complementary groups in amb molecule specifically the extension of chromophore from the electron donating amino group to the electron withdrawing bromine groups results in a significant bathochromic phenomenon li et al 2022 this bathochromic effect has previously been observed for other substituted anilines such as 2 aminobenzoic acid pozdnyakov et al 2009 it is worth noting that these absorption bands of amb overlap well with uvc 200 280 nm and uvb 280 320 nm regions therefore it is reasonable to speculate that phototransformation of amb is likely to occur under uv or sunlight radiation λ 290 nm interestingly the absorption spectrum of amb resembles that of dba this finding suggests that dba moiety is the critical chromophore accounting for the absorbance of amb therefore the photochemical behavior of amb may be manipulated by the dba moiety vide infra in addition a bathochromic shift was observed between amb and dba which implies that the 4 aminocyclohexanol branched chain affects the electronic transition of amb via lowering the excitation energy it was proposed that the electron donating effect of 4 aminocyclohexanol chain may enhance the electron density of dba moiety in amb molecule albeit that they are separated by a methylene group 3 2 direct photolysis and quantum yields exposure to uv254 radiation led to the attenuation of amb in neutral aqueous solution with 82 of the drug being removed under 2150 mj cm 2 fluence fig s1 sm this indicates that amb has high photoreactivity consistent with other haloanilines boule et al 1999 othmen and boule 1999a 1999b othmen et al 2000 in addition eliminating the dissolved oxygen by n2 bubbling did not promote the photolysis of amb appreciably data not shown possibly due to the very short lifetime of its triplet state grabner and richard 2005 it is noteworthy that the uv fluence required to achieve significant removal of amb is not relevant to uv disinfection because low fluences are common in this process i e 40 140 mj cm 2 huang et al 2018 suggested that uv disinfection doses are insufficient to remove most trace organic contaminants via direct photolysis therefore under disinfection uv fluence indirect photolysis of amb is possibly more important than direct photolysis the photoreactivity of amb was supported by the photolysis of dba the core chromophoric group of amb as shown in fig s1 of sm up to approximately 91 of dba was photodegraded at 1600 mj cm 2 uv fluence the photolysis of amb and dba both followed pseudo first order kinetics the fluence based pseudo first order rate constants k obs were calculated to be 0 825 10 3 and 1 625 10 3 cm2 mj 1 respectively by linear regression of the plot of ln c 0 c t as a function of uv fluence note that amb has a higher apparent molar extinction coefficient ε app than that of dba at 254 nm 6530 vs 4200 m 1cm 1 therefore the lower k obs of amb can be rationalized by the photophysics of the 4 aminocyclohexanol branched chain the alkyl branched chain has been known to be favorable for vibrational relaxation which quickly deactivate the electronically excited molecules through nonradiative pathway such vibrational relaxation also known as loose bolt effect is believed to be unfavorable for photochemistry turro et al 2010 the apparent phototransformation quantum yield φapp describes the efficiency of photochemical transformation of a substance after absorbing photons schwarzenbach et al 2003 fig s2 of sm shows the photolysis of amb and dba upon uv254 radiation under varying ph conditions the φapp of amb and dba under different ph conditions were calculated by eq 1 and illustrated in fig 2 the results show that the neutral form amb pk a 8 05 at ph 8 0 has a higher quantum yield than that of the protonated form at ph 8 0 meloun et al 2004 therefore alkaline aqueous solution may be favorable for the direct photolysis of amb for dba similar quantum yields were observed within the ph rang of 4 0 7 0 which is reasonable since neutral form of dba dominated pk a 1 8 however slightly lower quantum yields of dba photolysis were noticed under weak basic conditions ph 8 0 and 9 0 3 3 photoproducts the photolyzed solutions of amb and dba were concentrated by spe and then analyzed by hrms for identification of photoproducts tables s3 and s4 sm the structural assignment of amb photoproducts were based on the following criteria 1 the error between the measured and theoretical exact masses was less than 10 ppm 2 isotopic distribution of bromine substituents i e isotopic abundances of 79br and 81br 3 knowledges from the photoproducts of dba table s4 sm and 4 comparison to the mass spectrometric data reported in the literature tab et al 2021 on the basis of the above strategies we tentatively identified a total of 12 photoproducts derived from different photolytic mechanisms table s3 sm these photoproducts could be categorized into the following types hydrogen debromination products photoreduction hydroxylation product photoionization hydroxyl debromination products photonucleophilic substitution side chain cleavage products and aminophenoxazone products according to the molecular structures of photoproducts p1 p2 and p3 were proposed to be the primary photoproducts while others might be the secondary products on the base of the identified photoproducts the photolysis pathways of amb under uv254 radiation is described in scheme 1 3 4 photolytic mechanisms 3 4 1 photo debromination dehalogenation has frequently been observed during the phototransformation of haloanilines grabner and richard 2005 previous studies have constituted evidence in favor of triplet aminophenyl cations or carbenes as important intermediates involved in the photolysis of haloanilines in polar media miller et al 1979 othmen et al 2000 guizzardi et al 2001 the aminophenyl cation can be regarded as a tautomer of the protonated carbene which can be detected by transient absorption spectroscopy othmen et al 2000 guizzardi et al 2001 dehalogenation most likely takes place from a triplet excited state the br substituent has been known to have significant impacts on the photophysics of brominated organic compounds turro et al 2010 in particular the heavy atom effect of br is conducive to isc through spin orbit coupling soc this is because the large atomic number of br z 35 makes the electrons strongly affected by the nucleus in addition the br provides a monoatomic center where one electron undergoes px py orbital transition and the generated angular momentum is helpful for spin flipping to generate a triplet excited state turro et al 2010 indeed computational studies showed that isc dominates the photophysics of haloanilines such as 4 chloroaniline freccero et al 2003 the triplet excited state has two parallel spin electrons located in the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo respectively the electrons tend to avoid each other to achieve lower energy as a result the chemical bonds of triplets are prone to cleavage because the bond length is elongated and the bond energy becomes lower as evidenced by time dependent density functional theory td dft calculations musa and eriksson 2009 on the basis of above analysis we speculate that amb is susceptible toward debromination during photolysis the identification of reductive debromination product p1 and hydroxyl debromination product p3 by hrms supports our hypothesis the debromination reaction is further confirmed by the concentration of br as measured by ion chromatography fig s3 sm prior studies have provided evidence for the operation of a heterolytic dehalogenation mechanism freccero et al 2003 hara et al 2004 for example while the c f bond is the strongest fluoroanilines showed the highest quantum yields than the chlorinated and brominated congeners grabner and richard 2005 the failure to detect br2 by means of transient absorption spectroscopy further supported the fact that the debromination did not take place through a homolytic mechanism to produce br grabner and richard 2005 in this study we found that the addition of br inhibited the photolysis of dba while cl did not fig s4 sm this finding supports the above argument that heterolytic cleavage of br substituents occurred during bromoanilines photolysis kliegman et al 2013 this is because the in cage recombination of br and aminophenyl cation could regenerate the parent compound othmen et al 2000 the bond dissociation energy bde of c br bond is 80 kcal mol 1 rayne et al 2009 the observation that c br bond did not occur via a homolytic manner may be attributed to the fact that the triplet energy e t of bromoanilines is less than 80 kcal mol 1 for example the triplet energy of 4 bromoaniline was reported to be 76 kcal mol 1 hara et al 2004 through dft calculations freccero et al 2003 suggested that c x bond homolysis in the triplet state was endothermic in all cases while c x heterolysis in polar media was exothermic for the ccl and c br bonds the triplet phenyl cations or carbenes generated by heterolytic cleavage have diradical characteristic which can extract hydrogen from h donors to generate p1 in polar aqueous solution phenyl cations or carbenes are more likely subjected to hydrolysis to produce hydroxyl debromination product p3 grabner and richard 2005 such photohydrolysis reaction was proposed to be a concerted process of halide elimination and h2o attack grabner and richard 2005 in meoh a good h donor the photolysis of dba yielded 2 bromoaniline as an important photoproduct fig s5 sm the lack of detection of methoxylaniline ruled out the involvement of singlet phenyl cations or carbenes guizzardi et al 2001 this constitutes further support in favor of triplet phenyl cations or carbenes as important intermediates during bromoaniline photolysis freccero et al 2003 photo induced debromination occurred rapidly when 15 μm amb was completely photolyzed with 3200 mj cm 2 uv fluence 80 bromine was released as br fig s3a sm similar result was observed for the photolysis of dba fig s3b sm this indicates that both ortho and para bromine substituents should undergo photo dehalogenation however the photo dehalogenation of haloanilines has been reported to be regioselective othmen and boule 1999a 1999b to probe which br substituent in amb molecule was more preferentially released we analyzed the photolyzed solution of dba by hplc and compared the chromatogram with those of 4 amino 3 bromophenol 2 amino 5 bromophenol 2 bromoaniline and 4 bromoaniline standards 4 amino 3 bromophenol was the only photoproduct detected and its maximum yield achieved 25 fig s6 sm previous studies have shown that the priority order for photo dehalogenation of dichloroanilines followed an order of meta ortho para othmen and boule 1999b therefore we started off with the assumption that the ortho bromine substituent may be more easily removed the lack of detection of 2 amino 5 bromophenol during dba photolysis is however contrast to our expectation the photochemical behavior of dba was also in contrast to that of 2 4 dichloroaniline which generated 2 amino 5 chlorophenol but not 4 amino 3 chlorophenol othmen and boule 1999b it seems possible that the para bromine substituent was more susceptible toward photo debromination additional experiments were conducted to assess the photolability of the transformation products results confirm that 4 bromoaniline was more photoreactive than 2 bromoaniline in aqueous solution fig 3 the photolysis rate constant of the former was 22 fold higher than that of the latter the lower photoreactivity of 2 bromoaniline was supposed to be related with the intramolecular hydrogen bond between br and nh2 which might stabilize the bromine substituent in the excited states further investigation is necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanism results also reveal that 2 amino 5 bromophenol was highly photoreactive as compared to 4 amino 3 bromophenol photolysis rate constant 15 1 fig 3 this constitutes another evidence that 2 amino 5 bromophenol if photogenerated could be quickly transformed upon uv254 radiation on the basis of above results we proposed that the para bromine substituent of amb molecule was preferentially detached during the photolysis this hypothesis was supported by the evolution profile of br fig s3a sm as can be seen in the initial 30 min of photolysis corresponding to 1600 mj cm 2 fluence br was released rapidly with the formation rate d br dt being measured to be 0 55 μm min 1 which was close to the photodegradation rate of amb 0 66 0 03 μm min 1 this result indicates that photo debromination of para substituent played an important role in the primary photochemistry of amb 3 4 2 photoionization since the amine moieties have lone electron pairs amb are vulnerable toward photoionization under irradiation pozdnyakov et al 2009 indeed the lower ionization potential of amb has been confirmed by electrochemical studies sun et al 2014 the hydroxylated product p2 might be formed by further hydrolysis of anilino radical cation produced by photoionization similar mechanism has previously been proposed for the photolysis of other halogenated aromatic compounds yurkova et al 2013 li et al 2022 p2 was also detected during the photocatalytic degradation of amb tab et al 2021 in this case however the hydroxylated product was generated by electrophilic attack of ho on the benzene ring 3 4 3 side chain cleavage it is worth noting that photoionization could also occur on the amine branched chain resulting in the formation of a nitrogen radical cation followed by deprotonation of α c to yield an imine derivative the imine was unstable in aqueous solution and further hydrolysis could generate p5 and r2 see scheme 1 r2 underwent further photooxidation to generate the formaldehyde product p6 subsequent debromination and dealdehyde led to the formation of 2 amino 3 bromobenzaldehyde p7 and dba r3 the latter was subjected to photohydrolysis and photo dehalogenation to produce p8 p9 and p10 as confirmed by hrms analysis table s4 sm 3 4 4 formation of aminophenoxazones it is likely that the ortho br of amb also underwent primary photolysis e g hydroxyl debromination although such possibility was lower than that of para br however once ortho br finished photohydrolysis secondary photolysis could take place rapidly as confirmed by the high reactivity of 2 amino 5 bromophenol fig 3 studies have reported that 2 aminophenol could undergo coupling reaction leading to the formation of aminophenoxazone via an intermediate o benzoquinone monoimine o bqmi r1 and r2 hrms analyses suggested that dba photolysis led to the formation of 2 amino 7 bromophenoxazin 3 one and aminophenoxazone with the latter being likely derived from further photo debromination table s4 analogous to dba the photohydrolysis of ortho br of amb led to r4 which underwent further oxidation and coupling reaction to give rise to p11 and p12 see scheme 1 r1 r2 3 5 toxicity assessment bioluminescence inhibition assay was performed to evaluate whether toxic photoproducts were generated during uv254 radiation it was interesting to note that the presence of amb promoted the luminescence intensity as compared to the control 3 nacl solution fig s7 sm this indicates that amb had no toxicity to the tested luminescent bacterium p phosphoreum the exact reason for this phenomenon is unclear which warrants further investigations one possible explanation is that amb has the ability to scavenge reactive species tamba and torreggiani 2001 which may reduce the oxidative stress of luminescent bacterium therefore the presence of amb was likely beneficial to the growth and metabolism of the bacterium which enhanced their luminescence intensity in the case of irradiated samples the luminescence intensity increased firstly and decreased thereafter with increasing radiation time with the lowest value being obtained at 1076 mj cm 2 uv fluence this may be due to the release of br as a result of photo debromination our additional experiment showed that br could slightly inhibit the luminescence intensity and the inhibitory effect was closely related to the br concentration data not shown after 1076 mj cm 2 uv fluence the luminescence intensity increased gradually probably because some secondary photoproducts were beneficial for the growth and metabolism of the luminescent bacterium overall the photoproducts of amb were not toxic to luminescent bacterium however further assays using other organisms are still needed to obtain more comprehensive toxicological data 3 6 effect of nom nom ubiquitously present in natural and engineering waters significantly affects the photochemical behavior of organic contaminants mcneill and canonica 2016 nom can compete with organic compounds for absorbing photons due to the chromophores in nom molecules upon radiation chromophoric nom can generate triplet excited state and ros e g 1o2 and ho however nom also has a potential to quench reactive species and reduce reactive intermediate such as radical cations thus inhibiting the phototransformation of organic contaminants leresche et al 2016 our result shows that the presence of srnom as a representative of aquatic nom inhibited the photolysis of amb upon uv254 radiation fig 4a the inhibitory effect was exacerbated with increasing concentration of srnom for instance the rate of photolysis of amb decreased by 30 from 0 9 10 3 to 0 6 10 3 cm2 mj 1 in the presence of 10 mg l 1 srnom however calculation of light screening factor normalized rate constant eq 2 suggested that direct photolysis still accounted for 93 of amb transformation li et al 2022 this suggests that srnom served primarily as an inhibitor rather than a photosensitizer that accelerated the photolysis of amb the inhibitory effects of srnom on amb photolysis was mainly attributed to its competition for absorbing photons the remaining 7 transformation of amb in the presence of 10 mg l 1 srnom can be ascribed to the indirect photolysis mediated by 3srnom and or ros the oxidation of substituted anilines by 3nom via electron transfer has been well recognized leresche et al 2016 similar inhibitory effect of srnom on the photolysis of dba was also observed fig s8a sm 3 7 effect of no3 no3 is a photoreactive constituent widely present in wastewater uv radiation of no3 produces a series of ppris such as ho no2 and hoono which are capable of oxidizing organic pollutants r3 and r4 keen et al 2012 hora et al 2019 r3 no 3 h v ono o h onooh r4 no 3 h v o no 2 h h o no 2 experimental results show that the presence of no3 slightly promoted the photolysis of amb fig 4b as the concentration of no3 increased from 0 to 10 mm the k obs of amb increased by 0 5 fold from 0 9 10 3 to 1 35 10 3 cm2 mj 1 similar results were found for the photolysis of dba in the presence of no3 as the k obs value increased by 1 3 fold from 1 35 10 3 to 3 1 10 3 cm2 mj 1 fig s8b sm the photosensitizing effect of no3 could be attributed to its competition with the target compound to absorb photons resulting in the formation of reactive species that promoted the indirect photolysis of target compound aromatic amines such as bromoaniline have high electron density and low ionization potential thus they are readily to be attacked by reactive species through addition or electron transfer arnold 2014 indeed amb is a potential antioxidant drug that is capable of scavenging many ros including ho and o2 tamba and torreggiani 2001 for example the rate constant of amb with ho was determined to be 1 04 0 1 1010 m 1s 1 felix et al 1996 while our results imply that high level of no3 may facilitate the phototransformation of amb or other haloanilines in clean water very little impact of no3 would be expected at realistic concentration e g 1 mm considering the low light absorbance of no3 at 254 nm ε 4 25 m 1cm 1 goldstein and rabani 2007 moreover the potential formation of toxic and mutagenic nitrated byproducts should be scrutinized semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2018 3 8 photolysis of amb in wastewater to evaluate the removal efficiency of amb during uv treatment of wastewater we investigated the photolysis of amb in municipal wastewater treatment plants effluent under uv254 irradiation considering the detection limit of hplc and the environmentally relevant concentrations of pharmaceuticals both high 15 μm and low 5 μm concentrations of amb were investigated experimental results show that amb at high concentration was photochemically removed completely under uv fluence of 2150 mj cm 2 while amb with low concentration could be fully photodegraded under 1600 mj cm 2 fig s9 it is possible that high concentration of amb would have impacted the relevance of light scavenging and reactions with photoproduced reactive intermediates our result suggests that photosensitizers in wastewater such as no3 and efom are more likely to induce indirect photolysis of amb at low concentrations 4 conclusions and implications for wastewater treatment the results of this study can be summarized as follows i dba is the core chromophore of amb the uv vis absorption spectrum of amb bathochromically shifts as compared to that of dba the presence of 4 aminocyclohexanol branched chain lowers the photolysis rate constant of amb in comparison to dba ii the quantum yields of dba lacks growth at ph ranging from 4 0 to 9 0 for amb the quantum yield increases by 1 35 fold at ph 9 as compared to those below ph 8 iii both amb and dba undergo photo debromination with yields reaching 80 under 3200 mj cm 2 uv fluence photo debromination likely occurrs from the triplet excited states through a heterolytic mechanism with phenyl cations or carbenes as critical intermediates iv spe combined with hrms analyses identified 12 photoproducts of amb these photoproducts were derived from different photolytic mechanisms including photoreduction photoionization photonucleophilic substitution side chain cleavage and coupling reactions v the para br is more vulnerable toward photo debromination than the ortho br vi bioluminescence inhibition assay revealed that the photoproducts were not toxic vii the presence of srnom inhibited the photolysis of amb in contrast the photolysis of amb was slightly enhanced in the presence of no3 overall our results highlight the importance of uv254 radiation as an effective approach for the abatement of amb in wastewater the br released by photo debromination can be subsequently oxidized by o3 or hocl leading to the formation of toxic br dbps and bro3 bro3 is a possible human carcinogen with drinking water and ecotoxicological standards of 10 and 50 μg l 1 respectively von gunten 2018 therefore if amb is present at high concentrations in water matrices e g μg l 1 level the application of uv photolysis for water treatment should be done with caution credit authorship contribution statement lixiao wang

15387,as one of the most effective expectorant class drugs ambroxol amb has been frequently used to treat acute and chronic bronchitis extensive use and human excretion result in the widespread occurrence of amb in wastewater herein we reported the photolysis of amb in aqueous solution upon 254 nm ultraviolet radiation uv254 spectroscopic characterization showed that 2 4 dibromoaniline dba moiety is the core chromophore of amb quantum yield of dba changed little at ph 4 0 9 0 however amb showed higher quantum yield at ph 8 0 both dba and amb have high photoreactivity which can be attributed to the heavy atom effect of bromine substituents the photolysis of amb occurred through photoreduction photoionization photonucleophilic substitution side chain cleavage and coupling reactions both amb and dba underwent debromination with yields reaching 80 under 3200 mj cm 2 uv fluence photo debromination occurred preferentially at the para position the presence of natural organic matter inhibited the photodegradation mainly due to the light screening effect the photolysis of amb was slightly enhanced in the presence of no3 likely due to radical induced oxidation bioluminescence inhibition assay revealed that photoproducts were not toxic the results show that uv254 radiation with fluences relevant to advanced oxidation processes was effective for the abatement of amb in wastewater however uv254 treatment of wastewater containing higher concentrations μg l 1 of amb should be done with caution because the released br can be converted to toxic brominated disinfection byproducts and bromate in subsequent oxidation process graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords ambroxol 2 4 dibromoaniline debromination photodegradation photolysis mechanisms photoproducts data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ambroxol 2 amino 3 5 dibromo n trans 4 hydroxy cyclohexy benzylamine amb is an expectorant class drug widely used to increase surfactant secretion in lung and to decrease mucus viscosity see chart 1 for molecular structure xu et al 2015 this drug is therefore widely used to treat and prevent acute and chronic bronchitis extensive use and human excretion result in the widespread occurrence of amb in raw wastewater wastewater effluent and surface water with concentrations up to 1047 89 1 4 9 2 9 and 7 8 1 3 ng l 1 respectively zhang et al 2020 trace organic contaminants trocs can undergo a series of physical chemical and biological transformations during wastewater treatment processes such as adsorption hydrolysis oxidation and methylation brown et al 2020 zhi et al 2021 these processes strongly affect the environmental fates and ecological risks of trocs eniola et al 2022 maculewicz et al 2022 previous studies have shown that amb has antioxidant properties and can quench many reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radical ho sun et al 2014 therefore advanced oxidation processes aops such as tio2 photocatalysis and radiolysis can effectively remove amb from aqueous solutions tamba and torreggiani 2001 tab et al 2021 however little is known about the transformation and fate of amb in many other water treatment unit processes such as chlorination ozonation and uv photolysis uv photolysis using low or medium pressure mercury lamps is widely applied to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater and drinking water cai et al 2022 rodríguez et al 2022 uv radiation can rapidly modify the genetic materials of water borne pathogens such as dna and rna through the dimerization of thymine cheng et al 2021 as a result uv radiation achieves higher disinfection efficiency as compared to chlorination and ozonation in addition uv treatment does not generate disinfection by products dbps such as trihalomethanes thms halogenated acetic acids haas and bromate bro3 which otherwise can be generated in chlorination and ozonation marron et al 2019 von gunten 2018 these byproducts often have carcinogenic and mutagenic effects and are strictly controlled by water industry yang et al 2019 srivastav et al 2020 benítez et al 2021 uv disinfection also bears other benefits since some trocs can absorb photons and undergo direct photolysis which reduces the possibility of their occurrence in natural aquatic environment some well known photolabile trocs include diclofenac ketoprofen triclosan n nitrosodimethylamine etc plumlee and reinhard 2007 salgado et al 2013 davis et al 2017 wang et al 2022 in addition to direct photolysis photosensitizers present in wastewater matrices including effluent organic matter efom nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 are capable of inducing indirect photolysis of trocs by generating photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris such as triplet excited state efom 3efom singlet oxygen 1o2 and ho lian et al 2017 the molecular structure of amb features a core of 2 4 dibromoaniline dba and a branched chain of 4 aminocyclohexanol separated by a methylene see chart 1 photobiological studies showed that uvb irradiation enhanced the response of patch testing to amb suggesting that the drug had photosensitivity fujimoto et al 2009 many brominated aromatic compounds have very high photochemical reactivity and debromination often occurs during the photolytic processes grabner and richard 2005 rayne et al 2009 typical examples include the brominated flame retardants tetrabromobisphenol a s as well as the odorant compound 2 4 6 tribromoanisole wang et al 2015 xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the high photoreactivity of brominated aromatic compounds is partly due to the heavy atom effect of br substituents it is well known that heavy atoms in particular br and i favor the intersystem crossing isc by accelerating the flip of spins as a result brominated aromatic compounds especially polybrominated derivatives are readily to generate triplet excited states upon radiation turro et al 2010 in addition bromine substituent is a good leaving group that is vulnerable toward photonucleophilic substitution sn ar or photoreduction guizzardi et al 2001 freccero et al 2003 the released bromide ion br is also an issue worthy of special attention in wastewater treatment this is because br can be oxidized by ozone o3 and hypochlorous acid hocl to generate reactive bromine species rbs such as br br2 broh and hobr these rbs then react with natural organic matter nom or other organic substances to produce brominated dbps br dbps e g bromoform bromoacetic acids and bro3 with carcinogenic and mutagenic risks deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2014 previous studies on the photochemical degradation of haloanilines including bromoanilines provide evidence that photo dehalogenation is a heterolytic process starting from the triplet state grabner and richard 2005 ratti et al 2015 in addition the photochemical transformation of haloanilines is strongly affected by the type number and location of halogen substituents othmen and boule 1999a 1999b othmen et al 2000 these findings provide valuable information for us to describe the photochemical behavior of amb however to the author s knowledge there is no research on the photolysis of amb in aqueous solution including both direct and indirect photolysis thus further research is still needed to gain a better understanding of the mechanistic aspects and to explore the application of uv radiation to remediate effluents containing haloaniline families of contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides davis et al 2017 carena et al 2018 in this study we attempted to reveal the photoreactivity of amb under 254 nm ultraviolet uv254 radiation uv254 was chosen because it is widely used for wastewater treatment wan et al 2020 firstly we studied the absorption properties of amb by spectroscopic characterization which confirmed that dba is the key chromophore responsible for the absorbance of amb we then compared the photolysis kinetics of amb and dba including photolysis rate constants and quantum yields under varying ph conditions in particular the debromination behavior and photolytic mechanism of amb have been deeply investigated by high resolution mass spectrometry hrms and ion chromatography ic analyses because photoproducts may have higher toxicity than their parent compounds buth et al 2009 we also evaluated the toxicity of amb photoproducts by bioluminescence inhibition assay finally we evaluated the effects of nom and no3 two important wastewater constituents on the photolysis of amb the conclusions obtained in this study are helpful to reveal the transformation and photofate of amb during uv254 treatment of wastewater e g hospital wastewater since halogenated aniline derivatives are also important raw materials of synthetic drugs and pesticides this study also provides insights into the fate of these substances upon uv254 radiation davis et al 2017 carena et al 2018 2 materials

varian cary 50 uv vis spectrophotometer varian usa using 1 cm pathlength quartz cuvettes 2 3 photochemical experiments all photochemical experiments were carried out in a bl ghx v photoreactor shanghai bilon instrument co ltd equipped with a low pressure mercury lamp 15 w beijing institute of electric light source emitting predominantly 254 nm uv light the lamp was housed in a quartz cooling jacket connected to a bl t 1000s recirculating cooler to maintain the temperature at 20 1 the photon fluence rate was determined to be 1 9 10 9 e cm 2 s 1 which corresponds to a power output of 0 897 mw cm 2 using atrazine as an actinometer canonica et al 2008 detailed information for the calculation of photon fluence rate is provided in text s2 sm uv fluence mj cm 2 was calculated as the average photon fluence rate multiplied by the exposure time yuan et al 2009 the photoreactor was turn on for 15 min for lamp emission stabilization after that a series of uncapped cylindrical quartz

variation in toxicity through the photolysis of amb samples taken at different irradiation times were submitted to bioluminescence inhibition assay such assay monitors the changes of natural luminescence emitted by the luminescent bacterium p phosphoreum t3 spp in the presence of toxic substances freeze dried bacteria were obtained from the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences nanjing china after activation added with 2 nacl and incubation dilution with 3 nacl the bacteria were exposed to the irradiated solutions for 15 min at 25 c the bioluminescence intensity was recorded by an ensight multimode microplate reader coupled with kaleide workflow software perkinelmer ma usa eight replicate tests were performed for measuring the bioluminescence intensity of each irradiated sample 2 7 calculations the quantum yield φ mol e 1 of direct photolysis of amb and dba can be calculated by the following equation 1 φ d c d t e p 0 1 10 ε cl where c represents the concentration of target compound m ε represents the molar absorption coefficient of target compound at 254 nm m 1 cm 1 e p 0 represents the photon fluence rate of the low pressure mercury lamp e cm 2 s 1 and l represents the optical pathlength of the reaction tube cm in the presence of srnom we can normalize the direct photolysis rate constant of amb by light screening factor s λ li et al 2022 2 k

represents the beam attenuation coefficient cm 1 measured by the spectrophotometer l is well mixed depth of the water column 2 2 cm in our experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 uv vis absorption spectra fig 1 displays the uv vis absorption spectra of neutral aqueous solutions of amb and dba as can be seen the amb solution shows three absorption bands with peak wavelength λ max at 210 37 350 m 1 cm 1 245 10 170 m 1 cm 1 and 310 nm 2970 m 1 cm 1 respectively the first and second absorption bands e and k bands are derived from π π transition of the three conjugated double bonds of benzene ring fleming and williams 2019 the third absorption band b band is caused by the interaction between π π transition and benzene ring vibration fleming and williams 2019 it should be emphasized that the vibrational fine structure of b band was not observed because of interactions of solute with solvent in polar aqueous solution fleming and williams 2019 the absorption bands are significantly affected by the electronically complementary groups in amb molecule specifically the extension of chromophore from the electron donating amino group to the electron withdrawing bromine groups results in a significant bathochromic phenomenon li et al 2022 this bathochromic effect has previously been observed for other substituted anilines such as 2 aminobenzoic acid pozdnyakov et al 2009 it is worth noting that these absorption bands of amb overlap well with uvc 200 280 nm and uvb 280 320 nm regions therefore it is reasonable to speculate that phototransformation of amb is likely to occur under uv or sunlight radiation λ 290 nm interestingly the absorption spectrum of amb resembles that of dba this finding suggests that dba moiety is the critical chromophore accounting for the absorbance of amb therefore the photochemical behavior of amb may be manipulated by the dba moiety vide infra in addition a bathochromic shift was observed between amb and dba which implies that the 4 aminocyclohexanol branched chain affects the electronic transition of amb via lowering the excitation energy it was proposed that the electron donating effect of 4 aminocyclohexanol chain may enhance the electron density of dba moiety in amb molecule albeit that they are separated by a methylene group 3 2 direct photolysis and quantum yields exposure to uv254 radiation led to the attenuation of amb in neutral aqueous solution with 82 of the drug being removed under 2150 mj cm 2 fluence fig s1 sm this indicates that amb has high photoreactivity consistent with other haloanilines boule et al 1999 othmen and boule 1999a 1999b othmen et al 2000 in addition eliminating the dissolved oxygen by n2 bubbling did not promote the photolysis of amb appreciably data not shown possibly due to the very short lifetime of its triplet state grabner and richard 2005 it is noteworthy that the uv fluence required to achieve significant removal of amb is not relevant to uv disinfection because low fluences are common in this process i e 40 140 mj cm 2 huang et al 2018 suggested that uv disinfection doses are insufficient to remove most trace organic contaminants via direct photolysis therefore under disinfection uv fluence indirect photolysis of amb is possibly more important than direct photolysis the photoreactivity of amb was supported by the photolysis of dba the core chromophoric group of amb as shown in fig s1 of sm up to approximately 91 of dba was photodegraded at 1600 mj cm 2 uv fluence the photolysis of amb and dba both followed pseudo first order kinetics the fluence based pseudo first order rate constants k obs were calculated to be 0 825 10 3 and 1 625 10 3 cm2 mj 1 respectively by linear regression of the plot of ln c 0 c t as a function of uv fluence note that amb has a higher apparent molar extinction coefficient ε app than that of dba at 254 nm 6530 vs 4200 m 1cm 1 therefore the lower k obs of amb can be rationalized by the photophysics of the 4 aminocyclohexanol branched chain the alkyl branched chain has been known to be favorable for vibrational relaxation which quickly deactivate the electronically excited molecules through nonradiative pathway such vibrational relaxation also known as loose bolt effect is believed to be unfavorable for photochemistry turro et al 2010 the apparent phototransformation quantum yield φapp describes the efficiency of photochemical transformation of a substance after absorbing photons schwarzenbach et al 2003 fig s2 of sm shows the photolysis of amb and dba upon uv254 radiation under varying ph conditions the φapp of amb and dba under different ph conditions were calculated by eq 1 and illustrated in fig 2 the results show that the neutral form amb pk a 8 05 at ph 8 0 has a higher quantum yield than that of the protonated form at ph 8 0 meloun et al 2004 therefore alkaline aqueous solution may be favorable for the direct photolysis of amb for dba similar quantum yields were observed within the ph rang of 4 0 7 0 which is reasonable since neutral form of dba dominated pk a 1 8 however slightly lower quantum yields of dba photolysis were noticed under weak basic conditions ph 8 0 and 9 0 3 3 photoproducts the photolyzed solutions of amb and dba were concentrated by spe and then analyzed by hrms for identification of photoproducts tables s3 and s4 sm the structural assignment of amb photoproducts were based on the following criteria 1 the error between the measured and theoretical exact masses was less than 10 ppm 2 isotopic distribution of bromine substituents i e isotopic abundances of 79br and 81br 3 knowledges from the photoproducts of dba table s4 sm and 4 comparison to the mass spectrometric data reported in the literature tab et al 2021 on the basis of the above strategies we tentatively identified a total of 12 photoproducts derived from different photolytic mechanisms table s3 sm these photoproducts could be categorized into the following types hydrogen debromination products photoreduction hydroxylation product photoionization hydroxyl debromination products photonucleophilic substitution side chain cleavage products and aminophenoxazone products according to the molecular structures of photoproducts p1 p2 and p3 were proposed to be the primary photoproducts while others might be the secondary products on the base of the identified photoproducts the photolysis pathways of amb under uv254 radiation is described in scheme 1 3 4 photolytic mechanisms 3 4 1 photo debromination dehalogenation has frequently been observed during the phototransformation of haloanilines grabner and richard 2005 previous studies have constituted evidence in favor of triplet aminophenyl cations or carbenes as important intermediates involved in the photolysis of haloanilines in polar media miller et al 1979 othmen et al 2000 guizzardi et al 2001 the aminophenyl cation can be regarded as a tautomer of the protonated carbene which can be detected by transient absorption spectroscopy othmen et al 2000 guizzardi et al 2001 dehalogenation most likely takes place from a triplet excited state the br substituent has been known to have significant impacts on the photophysics of brominated organic compounds turro et al 2010 in particular the heavy atom effect of br is conducive to isc through spin orbit coupling soc this is because the large atomic number of br z 35 makes the electrons strongly affected by the nucleus in addition the br provides a monoatomic center where one electron undergoes px py orbital transition and the generated angular momentum is helpful for spin flipping to generate a triplet excited state turro et al 2010 indeed computational studies showed that isc dominates the photophysics of haloanilines such as 4 chloroaniline freccero et al 2003 the triplet excited state has two parallel spin electrons located in the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo respectively the electrons tend to avoid each other to achieve lower energy as a result the chemical bonds of triplets are prone to cleavage because the bond length is elongated and the bond energy becomes lower as evidenced by time dependent density functional theory td dft calculations musa and eriksson 2009 on the basis of above analysis we speculate that amb is susceptible toward debromination during photolysis the identification of reductive debromination product p1 and hydroxyl debromination product p3 by hrms supports our hypothesis the debromination reaction is further confirmed by the concentration of br as measured by ion chromatography fig s3 sm prior studies have provided evidence for the operation of a heterolytic dehalogenation mechanism freccero et al 2003 hara et al 2004 for example while the c f bond is the strongest fluoroanilines showed the highest quantum yields than the chlorinated and brominated congeners grabner and richard 2005 the failure to detect br2 by means of transient absorption spectroscopy further supported the fact that the debromination did not take place through a homolytic mechanism to produce br grabner and richard 2005 in this study we found that the addition of br inhibited the photolysis of dba while cl did not fig s4 sm this finding supports the above argument that heterolytic cleavage of br substituents occurred during bromoanilines photolysis kliegman et al 2013 this is because the in cage recombination of br and aminophenyl cation could regenerate the parent compound othmen et al 2000 the bond dissociation energy bde of c br bond is 80 kcal mol 1 rayne et al 2009 the observation that c br bond did not occur via a homolytic manner may be attributed to the fact that the triplet energy e t of bromoanilines is less than 80 kcal mol 1 for example the triplet energy of 4 bromoaniline was reported to be 76 kcal mol 1 hara et al 2004 through dft calculations freccero et al 2003 suggested that c x bond homolysis in the triplet state was endothermic in all cases while c x heterolysis in polar media was exothermic for the ccl and c br bonds the triplet phenyl cations or carbenes generated by heterolytic cleavage have diradical characteristic which can extract hydrogen from h donors to generate p1 in polar aqueous solution phenyl cations or carbenes are more likely subjected to hydrolysis to produce hydroxyl debromination product p3 grabner and richard 2005 such photohydrolysis reaction was proposed to be a concerted process of halide elimination and h2o attack grabner and richard 2005 in meoh a good h donor the photolysis of dba yielded 2 bromoaniline as an important photoproduct fig s5 sm the lack of detection of methoxylaniline ruled out the involvement of singlet phenyl cations or carbenes guizzardi et al 2001 this constitutes further support in favor of triplet phenyl cations or carbenes as important intermediates during bromoaniline photolysis freccero et al 2003 photo induced debromination occurred rapidly when 15 μm amb was completely photolyzed with 3200 mj cm 2 uv fluence 80 bromine was released as br fig s3a sm similar result was observed for the photolysis of dba fig s3b sm this indicates that both ortho and para bromine substituents should undergo photo dehalogenation however the photo dehalogenation of haloanilines has been reported to be regioselective othmen and boule 1999a 1999b to probe which br substituent in amb molecule was more preferentially released we analyzed the photolyzed solution of dba by hplc and compared the chromatogram with those of 4 amino 3 bromophenol 2 amino 5 bromophenol 2 bromoaniline and 4 bromoaniline standards 4 amino 3 bromophenol was the only photoproduct detected and its maximum yield achieved 25 fig s6 sm previous studies have shown that the priority order for photo dehalogenation of dichloroanilines followed an order of meta ortho para othmen and boule 1999b therefore we started off with the assumption that the ortho bromine substituent may be more easily removed the lack of detection of 2 amino 5 bromophenol during dba photolysis is however contrast to our expectation the photochemical behavior of dba was also in contrast to that of 2 4 dichloroaniline which generated 2 amino 5 chlorophenol but not 4 amino 3 chlorophenol othmen and boule 1999b it seems possible that the para bromine substituent was more susceptible toward photo debromination additional experiments were conducted to assess the photolability of the transformation products results confirm that 4 bromoaniline was more photoreactive than 2 bromoaniline in aqueous solution fig 3 the photolysis rate constant of the former was 22 fold higher than that of the latter the lower photoreactivity of 2 bromoaniline was supposed to be related with the intramolecular hydrogen bond between br and nh2 which might stabilize the bromine substituent in the excited states further investigation is necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanism results also reveal that 2 amino 5 bromophenol was highly photoreactive as compared to 4 amino 3 bromophenol photolysis rate constant 15 1 fig 3 this constitutes another evidence that 2 amino 5 bromophenol if photogenerated could be quickly transformed upon uv254 radiation on the basis of above results we proposed that the para bromine substituent of amb molecule was preferentially detached during the photolysis this hypothesis was supported by the evolution profile of br fig s3a sm as can be seen in the initial 30 min of photolysis corresponding to 1600 mj cm 2 fluence br was released rapidly with the formation rate d br dt being measured to be 0 55 μm min 1 which was close to the photodegradation rate of amb 0 66 0 03 μm min 1 this result indicates that photo debromination of para substituent played an important role in the primary photochemistry of amb 3 4 2 photoionization since the amine moieties have lone electron pairs amb are vulnerable toward photoionization under irradiation pozdnyakov et al 2009 indeed the lower ionization potential of amb has been confirmed by electrochemical studies sun et al 2014 the hydroxylated product p2 might be formed by further hydrolysis of anilino radical cation produced by photoionization similar mechanism has previously been proposed for the photolysis of other halogenated aromatic compounds yurkova et al 2013 li et al 2022 p2 was also detected during the photocatalytic degradation of amb tab et al 2021 in this case however the hydroxylated product was generated by electrophilic attack of ho on the benzene ring 3 4 3 side chain cleavage it is worth noting that photoionization could also occur on the amine branched chain resulting in the formation of a nitrogen radical cation followed by deprotonation of α c to yield an imine derivative the imine was unstable in aqueous solution and further hydrolysis could generate p5 and r2 see scheme 1 r2 underwent further photooxidation to generate the formaldehyde product p6 subsequent debromination and dealdehyde led to the formation of 2 amino 3 bromobenzaldehyde p7 and dba r3 the latter was subjected to photohydrolysis and photo dehalogenation to produce p8 p9 and p10 as confirmed by hrms analysis table s4 sm 3 4 4 formation of aminophenoxazones it is likely that the ortho br of amb also underwent primary photolysis e g hydroxyl debromination although such possibility was lower than that of para br however once ortho br finished photohydrolysis secondary photolysis could take place rapidly as confirmed by the high reactivity of 2 amino 5 bromophenol fig 3 studies have reported that 2 aminophenol could undergo coupling reaction leading to the formation of aminophenoxazone via an intermediate o benzoquinone monoimine o bqmi r1 and r2 hrms analyses suggested that dba photolysis led to the formation of 2 amino 7 bromophenoxazin 3 one and aminophenoxazone with the latter being likely derived from further photo debromination table s4 analogous to dba the photohydrolysis of ortho br of amb led to r4 which underwent further oxidation and coupling reaction to give rise to p11 and p12 see scheme 1 r1 r2 3 5 toxicity assessment bioluminescence inhibition assay was performed to evaluate whether toxic photoproducts were generated during uv254 radiation it was interesting to note that the presence of amb promoted the luminescence intensity as compared to the control 3 nacl solution fig s7 sm this indicates that amb had no toxicity to the tested luminescent bacterium p phosphoreum the exact reason for this phenomenon is unclear which warrants further investigations one possible explanation is that amb has the ability to scavenge reactive species tamba and torreggiani 2001 which may reduce the oxidative stress of luminescent bacterium therefore the presence of amb was likely beneficial to the growth and metabolism of the bacterium which enhanced their luminescence intensity in the case of irradiated samples the luminescence intensity increased firstly and decreased thereafter with increasing radiation time with the lowest value being obtained at 1076 mj cm 2 uv fluence this may be due to the release of br as a result of photo debromination our additional experiment showed that br could slightly inhibit the luminescence intensity and the inhibitory effect was closely related to the br concentration data not shown after 1076 mj cm 2 uv fluence the luminescence intensity increased gradually probably because some secondary photoproducts were beneficial for the growth and metabolism of the luminescent bacterium overall the photoproducts of amb were not toxic to luminescent bacterium however further assays using other organisms are still needed to obtain more comprehensive toxicological data 3 6 effect of nom nom ubiquitously present in natural and engineering waters significantly affects the photochemical behavior of organic contaminants mcneill and canonica 2016 nom can compete with organic compounds for absorbing photons due to the chromophores in nom molecules upon radiation chromophoric nom can generate triplet excited state and ros e g 1o2 and ho however nom also has a potential to quench reactive species and reduce reactive intermediate such as radical cations thus inhibiting the phototransformation of organic contaminants leresche et al 2016 our result shows that the presence of srnom as a representative of aquatic nom inhibited the photolysis of amb upon uv254 radiation fig 4a the inhibitory effect was exacerbated with increasing concentration of srnom for instance the rate of photolysis of amb decreased by 30 from 0 9 10 3 to 0 6 10 3 cm2 mj 1 in the presence of 10 mg l 1 srnom however calculation of light screening factor normalized rate constant eq 2 suggested that direct photolysis still accounted for 93 of amb transformation li et al 2022 this suggests that srnom served primarily as an inhibitor rather than a photosensitizer that accelerated the photolysis of amb the inhibitory effects of srnom on amb photolysis was mainly attributed to its competition for absorbing photons the remaining 7 transformation of amb in the presence of 10 mg l 1 srnom can be ascribed to the indirect photolysis mediated by 3srnom and or ros the oxidation of substituted anilines by 3nom via electron transfer has been well recognized leresche et al 2016 similar inhibitory effect of srnom on the photolysis of dba was also observed fig s8a sm 3 7 effect of no3 no3 is a photoreactive constituent widely present in wastewater uv radiation of no3 produces a series of ppris such as ho no2 and hoono which are capable of oxidizing organic pollutants r3 and r4 keen et al 2012 hora et al 2019 r3 no 3 h v ono o h onooh r4 no 3 h v o no 2 h h o no 2 experimental results show that the presence of no3 slightly promoted the photolysis of amb fig 4b as the concentration of no3 increased from 0 to 10 mm the k obs of amb increased by 0 5 fold from 0 9 10 3 to 1 35 10 3 cm2 mj 1 similar results were found for the photolysis of dba in the presence of no3 as the k obs value increased by 1 3 fold from 1 35 10 3 to 3 1 10 3 cm2 mj 1 fig s8b sm the photosensitizing effect of no3 could be attributed to its competition with the target compound to absorb photons resulting in the formation of reactive species that promoted the indirect photolysis of target compound aromatic amines such as bromoaniline have high electron density and low ionization potential thus they are readily to be attacked by reactive species through addition or electron transfer arnold 2014 indeed amb is a potential antioxidant drug that is capable of scavenging many ros including ho and o2 tamba and torreggiani 2001 for example the rate constant of amb with ho was determined to be 1 04 0 1 1010 m 1s 1 felix et al 1996 while our results imply that high level of no3 may facilitate the phototransformation of amb or other haloanilines in clean water very little impact of no3 would be expected at realistic concentration e g 1 mm considering the low light absorbance of no3 at 254 nm ε 4 25 m 1cm 1 goldstein and rabani 2007 moreover the potential formation of toxic and mutagenic nitrated byproducts should be scrutinized semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2018 3 8 photolysis of amb in wastewater to evaluate the removal efficiency of amb during uv treatment of wastewater we investigated the photolysis of amb in municipal wastewater treatment plants effluent under uv254 irradiation considering the detection limit of hplc and the environmentally relevant concentrations of pharmaceuticals both high 15 μm and low 5 μm concentrations of amb were investigated experimental results show that amb at high concentration was photochemically removed completely under uv fluence of 2150 mj cm 2 while amb with low concentration could be fully photodegraded under 1600 mj cm 2 fig s9 it is possible that high concentration of amb would have impacted the relevance of light scavenging and reactions with photoproduced reactive intermediates our result suggests that photosensitizers in wastewater such as no3 and efom are more likely to induce indirect photolysis of amb at low concentrations 4 conclusions and implications for wastewater treatment the results of this study can be summarized as follows i dba is the core chromophore of amb the uv vis absorption spectrum of amb bathochromically shifts as compared to that of dba the presence of 4 aminocyclohexanol branched chain lowers the photolysis rate constant of amb in comparison to dba ii the quantum yields of dba lacks growth at ph ranging from 4 0 to 9 0 for amb the quantum yield increases by 1 35 fold at ph 9 as compared to those below ph 8 iii both amb and dba undergo photo debromination with yields reaching 80 under 3200 mj cm 2 uv fluence photo debromination likely occurrs from the triplet excited states through a heterolytic mechanism with phenyl cations or carbenes as critical intermediates iv spe combined with hrms analyses identified 12 photoproducts of amb these photoproducts were derived from different photolytic mechanisms including photoreduction photoionization photonucleophilic substitution side chain cleavage and coupling reactions v the para br is more vulnerable toward photo debromination than the ortho br vi bioluminescence inhibition assay revealed that the photoproducts were not toxic vii the presence of srnom inhibited the photolysis of amb in contrast the photolysis of amb was slightly enhanced in the presence of no3 overall our results highlight the importance of uv254 radiation as an effective approach for the abatement of amb in wastewater the br released by photo debromination can be subsequently oxidized by o3 or hocl leading to the formation of toxic br dbps and bro3 bro3 is a possible human carcinogen with drinking water and ecotoxicological standards of 10 and 50 μg l 1 respectively von gunten 2018 therefore if amb is present at high concentrations in water matrices e g μg l 1 level the application of uv photolysis for water treatment should be done with caution credit authorship contribution statement lixiao wang

15388,stormwater runoff capture and groundwater recharge can provide a sustainable means of augmenting the local water resources in water stressed cities while simultaneously mitigating flood risk provided that these processes do not compromise groundwater quality we developed and tested for one year an innovative pilot scale stormwater treatment train that employs cost effective engineered geomedia in a continuous flow unit process system to remove contaminants from urban runoff during aquifer recharge the system consisted of an iron enhanced sand filter for phosphate removal a woodchip bioreactor for nitrate removal coupled to an aeration step and columns packed with different configurations of biochar and manganese oxide containing sand to remove trace metals and persistent mobile and toxic trace organic contaminants during conditioning with authentic stormwater runoff over an extended period 8 months the woodchip bioreactor removed 98 of the influent nitrate 9 g n m 3 d 1 while phosphate broke through the iron enhanced sand filter during the challenge test 4 months geomedia removed more than 80 of the mass of metals and trace organic compounds column hydraulic performance was stable during the entire study and the weathered biochar and manganese oxide were effective at removing trace organic contaminants and metals respectively under conditions likely encountered in the field sustained nutrient removal is probable but polar organic compounds such as 2 4 d could breakthrough after about a decade for conditions at the study site graphical abstract

resource that could help meet the demands of water stressed cities through the use of managed aquifer recharge and recovery hamdan 2009 luthy et al 2019 however nutrients toxic metals and polar trace organics are present in urban stormwater at concentrations that pose potential risks to drinking water supplies masoner et al 2019 page et al 2014 green stormwater infrastructure can reduce flood risks and remove numerous contaminants while simultaneously providing ecological and societal benefits mcfarland et al 2019 stormwater harvesting systems increase groundwater recharge and typically include pre treatment then retention basins to ensure saturated infiltration and more recently passive treatment systems fig s1 hagekhalil et al 2014 martire 2018 biofilters treat captured urban stormwater by percolating it through porous media by gravity i e biofiltration prior to surface water discharge or use for aquifer recharge feng et al 2012 hatt et al 2008 however these systems are usually designed for hydraulic performance with contaminant removal as a secondary consideration edwards et al 2016 the most commonly used biofiltration media e g coarse sand amended with mulch improves water quality mostly through removal of suspended solids particle associated contaminants and microbial transformation processes bester and schäfer 2009 some contaminants of urban origin particularly persistent mobile and toxic pmt organic contaminants hale et al 2020 jin et al 2020 may not be adequately removed by such treatments reemtsma et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 several types of engineered geomedia may more effectively remove contaminants during passive infiltration carbonaceous materials e g biochar adsorb trace organic and metal contaminants in stormwater mohanty et al 2018 some manganese oxide coated sands oxidize electron rich organic contaminants charbonnet et al 2018 grebel et al 2016 and adsorb metals during stormwater infiltration charbonnet et al 2020 other cost efficient geomedia like woodchips and iron filings can remove nitrate and phosphate from stormwater erickson et al 2012 halaburka et al 2019 2017 thus reconfigured green infrastructure systems with engineered geomedia could provide a means of contaminant removal by sorption and redox processes grebel et al 2013 many types of geomedia perform well at the laboratory scale however little is known about how different weathered engineered geomedia perform when integrated into a series of continuous flow unit operations subjected to authentic stormwater okaikue woodi et al 2020 field testing has demonstrated that geomedia performance can decline within a few months of operation robertson 2010 in addition combining different geomedia configurations i e unit operations in series or directly mixing geomedia i e within the same unit operation to assess their synergistic or antagonistic effects on contaminant removal is significantly under developed spahr et al 2019 for instance biochar may adsorb natural organic matter and thus prolong the treatment capacity of manganese oxides charbonnet et al 2020 uchimiya et al 2010 conversely reducing conditions stimulated by labile organic compounds in woodchip leachate may dissolve fe iii and mn iv oxide geomedia release adsorbed trace metals and even promote trace metal removal through sulfide precipitation grebel et al 2013 similarly microbial activity could enhance the transformation of some contaminants or could block sites for sorption or abiotic oxidation reactions hellauer et al 2018 portmann et al 2022 finally physicochemical weathering and biofilm growth could lower the hydraulic conductivity of the infiltration system perujo et al 2019 an improved understanding of these contaminant removal factors including geomedia configuration is essential to the design and sustained success of large scale stormwater treatment trains in this study we evaluated the efficacy of engineered geomedia for passive removal of stormwater contaminants over a 1 year period in a pilot scale infiltration system the objective of this research was to test a new approach for integrating stormwater treatment train unit operations for nutrient metals and trace organic contaminants under the saturated flow conditions that may be used for managed aquifer recharge fig s1 this study uses a novel integration of coupled unit operations under continuous flow weathered with authentic stormwater and testing of multiple configurations of biochar and metal oxide geomedia for trace organic contaminant removal different unit process configurations were evaluated during eight months of conditioning with stormwater this was followed by a four month challenge test on 24 weathered geomedia enhanced columns with stormwater spiked with representative contaminants these results significantly expand upon our previous study evaluating the effect of different woodchip bioreactor configurations on the removal of trace metal and organic contaminants at the same site ashoori et al 2019 by integrating multiple geomedia configurations in the previous study no contaminant breakthrough was observed in biochar amended bioreactors and a diffusion limited sorption model predicted decades of service for trace organic removal understanding the effects of extended exposure to authentic stormwater on engineered geomedia various configurations of geomedia unit operations and chemical analysis of the geomedia after challenge testing provide novel insights into the biogeochemical processes relevant during stormwater infiltration and links laboratory studies to full scale deployment of engineered infiltration systems 2 methods and reagents 2 1 field site and water source the pilot scale treatment system was located inside a warehouse at sonoma county water agency scwa facilities in sonoma ca fig s2 this structure moderated temperature i e 18 25 c and provided a dark environment that limited algal growth on exposed tubing urban runoff and stormwater were collected from fryer creek 38 17 15 n 122 27 60 w for the eight month conditioning which is fed primarily by stormwater runoff during winter rainy season and urban irrigation drainage during dry summer season from a mixed residential and commercial development table s1 fig s3 every 2 to 4 weeks stormwater was collected using a pump with a 300 μm polypropylene filter bag on the intake strainer and a 75 μm filter on the intake hose collected water was immediately transferred in a 1500 l polyethylene tank to the warehouse where it was stored in a black 2500 l polyethylene tank the tanks and collection equipment were rinsed with tap water and air dried after every use 2 2 geomedia enhanced unit process system a pilot scale unit process treatment train was built to assess the different unit operations of the stormwater treatment system fig 1 collected stormwater tank 0 was first pumped to an iron enhanced sand filter designed to remove dissolved phosphorus erickson et al 2012 the iron enhanced sand filter was a down flow pvc column 40 cm length 10 cm inside diameter filled with astm c33 grade sand and 5 iron filings iron aggregate provided by connelly gpm inc chicago il by weight for a designed hydraulic conductivity of 0 015 cm s 1 this well established technology served as a pre treatment step for phosphate removal the iron enhanced sand filter drained into a 40 l polyethylene tank tank 1 the flow from this tank was split into thirteen separate lines not shown separately in the figure for clarity one first line passed through a woodchip denitrifying bioreactor 50 cm length 10 cm inside diameter halaburka et al 2019 2017 prior to subsequent pumping through 12 geomedia columns 100 cm length 5 cm inside diameter consisting of sand control or manganese oxide coated sand and sand amended with biochar fig s4 another 12 lines flowed directly to identical geomedia treatment columns fig 1 each column group with and without the woodchip bioreactor nitrate pre treatment consisted of triplicates of three different biochar and manganese oxide coated sand configurations and sand controls mixed biochar manganese oxide coated sand designated mx 45 cm layers of biochar prior to manganese oxide coated sand designated bm and 45 cm layers of manganese oxide coated sand before biochar designated mb columns in which the woodchip bioreactor was employed prior to geomedia treatment were designated with a w prefix a total of 24 geomedia packed pvc columns fig 1 were employed in this study the columns exceeded the minimum ratio of column to particle diameter i e 50 1 recommended to avoid preferential flow pathways due to wall effects lang et al 1993 geomedia columns were operated in continuous upflow mode to facilitate saturated conditions throughout the experiments because saturated conditions are likely to be employed in large scale treatment systems ashoori et al 2019 the biochar was obtained from mountain crest gardens etna ca and exhibited a n2 b e t surface area of 318 m2 g 1 ulrich et al 2015 it was sieved through a 20 30 mesh 0 6 0 85 mm and mixed at 1 wt with 20 30 mesh ottawa sand manganese greensand was obtained from greensandplus 18 60 mesh clayton nj and was sieved to remove 30 mesh fine particles prior to use further details on geomedia column characteristics construction and packing material preparation are included in the supplementary material column porosities were calculated gravimetrically after saturation with deionized water table s2 tracer tests with 4 86 mm nabr were used to determine the hydraulic retention times at the end of the pre conditioning stage table s3 initial pore volumes were measured before challenge testing began and these values were used for reporting throughout the experiment the saturated hydraulic conductivities ksat of the columns were measured throughout the experiment eq s1 fig s5 table s4 using the constant head standard method astm 2006 the mn coating density of the manganese oxide coated sand was quantified by dissolving the coating of a 0 5 g sample with 10 ml of 30 mm ascorbic acid and quantifying dissolved i e passing through a 0 45 µm nylon filter mn by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy the average mn oxidation state was determined by iodometric titration murray et al 1984 finally a wireless sensor internet of things network enabled continuous system monitoring and remote control of the pilot scale system details in supplementary material fig s6 2 3 field conditioning and challenge testing stormwater runoff was introduced into the treatment system during an eight month continuous conditioning period to develop a weathered geomedia simulating one rainy and one dry season of use the iron enhanced sand filter and woodchip biofilter were operated at average volumetric flowrates of 90 and 18 ml min 1 corresponding to a darcy velocity of 68 and 14 cm h 1 respectively geomedia columns were conditioned at a 0 85 ml min 1 volumetric flowrate equivalent to a darcy velocity of 2 5 cm h 1 during the conditioning period the top of the iron enhanced sand filter was regularly scraped to avoid its hydraulic failure due to formation of a biologically active cake layer i e schmutzdecke huisman and wood 1974 following column conditioning a four month challenge test was performed to assess the removal of trace organic compounds and metals the challenge test was conducted using synthetic stormwater see table s5 for composition the synthetic stormwater provided a consistent matrix throughout the test and represented typical stormwater conditions pitt et al 2015 during the challenge test to simulate the authentic stormwater used during the conditioning period the synthetic stormwater used in geomedia enhanced columns that had not received denitrifying woodchip bioreactor pretreatment bm mb mx and ct were enriched with nitrate resulting in 2 6 0 4 mg l 1 no3 n whereas the synthetic stormwater used with columns that were conditioned with the woodchip bioreactor effluent w columns was prepared without supplemental nitrogen fig s7 to initiate the challenge test the columns were acclimatized for 14 days i e approximately 18 to 30 pore volumes with synthetic stormwater then 50 μg l 1 of each the following six persistent mobile and toxic trace organic contaminants were added to the synthetic stormwater 2 4 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid 2 4 d 1h benzotriazole 1h bt tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep atrazine atz diuron diu fipronil fip additionally 50 μg l 1 each of nickel copper zinc cadmium and lead were spiked as their chloride salts the high concentrations of spiked contaminants relative to concentrations typical of stormwater were intended to induce breakthrough within the timeframe of the experiment the actual concentrations of influent trace organic compounds and metals were measured immediately upstream of column inlets to control for any deviation from the nominal concentration due to losses in the storage tank the true influent values were used to calculate removal efficiency for the contaminants i e c c0 the chemical structure physicochemical properties e g partition coefficients reported range and mean concentrations of contaminants in urban runoff and typical urban runoff sources for the contaminants are listed in the supplementary materials table s6 the stormwater contaminants represented a broad range of physicochemical properties e g octanol water distribution coefficient dow values spanning four orders of magnitude and reactivity towards the studied geomedia charbonnet et al 2020 grebel et al 2016 ulrich et al 2015 the stock solutions of trace organic contaminants were prepared in methanol the concentration of methanol in the synthetic stormwater i e 0 05 around 100 mg c l 1 is similar to amounts used in other studies which mainly focused on abiotic removal processes of persistent chemicals ashoori et al 2019 cornelissen et al 2005 ulrich et al 2017b although the additional methanol resulted in dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations that were elevated relative to typical urban stormwater conditions pitt et al 2015 there was no evidence of column hydraulic failure additionally metal stock additions did not influence the ph of the synthetic stormwater stored in tanks during the challenge test tank 1 and 2 7 7 0 4 and 7 7 0 1 respectively and sulfidogenic conditions were avoided by constant aeration in both tanks fig s7 geochemical modeling with visual minteq indicated that no metals were present at concentrations above their solubility limits further details in the supplementary materials every two months all ptfe tubing connections were cleared scouring with a small plunger washed with 1 hcl solution and thoroughly rinsed with milli q water to avoid biofilm accumulation and clogging feed solutions were homogenized by gentle aeration and were replaced weekly to minimize microbial activity 2 4 analytical methods statistical analysis and metal speciation analysis full details on analytical methods used for measuring water quality parameters quantification of trace metals by icp ms and trace organics by lc ms ms together with qa qc data are included in the supplementary materials fig s8 tables s7 s10 3 results and discussion 3 1 field conditioning period 3 1 1 pretreatment columns iron enhanced sand filter and woodchip bioreactor plus aeration both the iron enhanced sand filter and woodchip bioreactor operated during the entire 8 month conditioning period without failure due to clogging although phosphate broke through the iron enhanced sand filter the woodchip bioreactor removed nitrate throughout the conditioning period fig s9 the iron enhanced sand filter removed 3 86 mg po4 3 p per g iron filings only about 16 of influent phosphate supplementary materials eqs s2 and s3 the effluent remained oxic and the filter did not affect other water quality parameters figs s10 to s12 the woodchip bioreactor consistently removed nitrate c c0 0 06 throughout the eight months of conditioning figs s9 to s11 on average 98 of no3 was removed and effluent concentrations remained below 0 03 mg l 1 no3 n normalized for reactor volume the removal rate was 9 3 3 g n m 3 d 1 which was consistent with the performance of similar systems coleman et al 2019 schipper et al 2010 under the conditions tested consistent nitrate removal from stormwater could achieve a decadal service lifetime details in the supplementary materials section fig s13 denitrifying conditions were accompanied by the absence of dissolved o2 in the woodchip bioreactor effluent figs s10 and s11 doc concentrations in the effluent from the woodchip bioreactor ranged from 3 to 17 mg c l 1 an increase from an average value of 4 4 1 2 mg c l 1 in the influent i e tank 1 approximately 18 g c d 1 was released per m3 of woodchip bioreactor volume the woodchip bioreactor also induced partial sulfate reduction figs s10 and s11 based on our field observations we hypothesize that the iron enhanced filter failed hydraulically due to the continuous flow conditions however the 3 86 mg po4 3 p removed per g iron filings falls within the reported ranges for similar systems at the end of their useful life erickson et al 2017 2012 we believe this failure was related to concurrent factors including i physical clogging at the effluent spout not removed by top filter maintenance ii stratification of the thin i e 5 cm pea gravel layer at the bottom of the unit iii development of a rust colored thin crust probably iron ochre on the columns at the end of the experiment fig s14 and iv operating the system under continuous flow conditions at higher rates than tested in previous studies erickson et al 2012 similar issues have been observed in an iron enhanced stormwater filtration system erickson et al 2017 3 1 2 geomedia amended biofilters geomedia containing columns removed 90 of influent doc from the stormwater runoff during the first 2 3 months of conditioning i e up to 200 pore volumes after which time breakthrough occurred fig s15 in contrast the sand control columns had higher effluent doc concentrations during the first 2 3 months of the conditioning period p 0 05 tables s11 and s12 these results suggest that doc removal was mainly due to sorption on biochar or mn oxide and breakthrough occurred after the geomedia surface became saturated microbial respiration likely accounted for a fraction of doc removal during this period largely originating from the woodchips or background stormwater organic carbon and became a more important removal mechanism as the column aged as evidenced by a decrease in effluent dissolved o2 after the initial conditioning period fig s16 influent dissolved o2 concentrations to the geomedia amended and the control sand columns were near saturation though tank 2 had significantly higher dissolved o2 p 0 05 concentrations the average values in tanks 1 and 2 were 7 8 1 3 and 9 0 1 0 mg l 1 respectively effluent o2 concentrations were low for all geomedia containing columns typically 4 5 mg l 1 throughout conditioning effluent o2 concentrations were higher i e 4 6 mg l 1 for the sand controls fig s16 the extent of microbial respiration increased during the first two months of conditioning after which effluent o2 concentration remained steady a simplified mass balance for doc removal and o2 consumption indicated that in the later stages of the challenge test aerobic respiration by microbial communities greatly exceeded doc removal by sorption fig s17 in all of the geomedia treatments including the sand controls the ph of the stormwater decreased by about 0 5 ph units fig s18 the drop in ph in the geomedia columns was consistent with microbial respiration releasing co2 geomedia amended column effluents exhibited lower average ph values than their control counterparts fig s18 though the differences were only statistically significant for layered geomedia columns with woodchip pretreatment tables s11 and s12 due to efficient pre treatment by the woodchip bioreactor geomedia columns that were fed by the woodchip bioreactor received influent nitrate at concentrations below the detection limit i e 0 01 mg no3 n l 1 fig s19 while the influent to the other columns contained an average of 1 4 1 0 mg no3 n l 1 typically about 30 of the nitrate was removed from those columns during conditioning period suggesting that nitrate reducing conditions were present the incomplete nitrate removal in both control and geomedia containing columns suggests that anaerobic conditions were limited to certain regions no column configuration consistently removed phosphate or sulfate during the conditioning stage figs s19 and s20 3 2 field challenge test after eight months of field conditioning the geomedia amended columns exhibited sustained high removal of polar trace organic compounds over 200 pore volumes during the challenge testing figs 2 a b and s21 and table s13 geomedia containing columns attenuated contaminants significantly better than the sand control columns p 0 05 tables s14 and s15 the removal of polar trace organic compounds c c0 lower than 0 25 emphasizes the value of biochar for sorption because results from previous studies indicate that widely used woodchip and straw bioreactors alone cannot remove many of these compounds ashoori et al 2019 concentrations of trace organic contaminants measured in samples collected from the column side ports demonstrated that biochar removed trace organic contaminants more effectively than manganese oxide coated sand figs 2c f and s22 tables s16 17 contaminant concentrations dropped most rapidly in the zones where biochar was abundant i e in the front and back half of the bm and mb columns respectively depth concentration profiles also enabled predictions of contaminant breakthrough time after 200 pore volumes samples from the first side port i e at 25 cm into the column indicate that the sequence of contaminant breakthrough would be 2 4 d followed by atrazine tcep fipronil 1h benzotriazole and diuron fig s23 regardless of woodchip bioreactor pre treatment diuron and 1h benzotriazole are found in urban runoff arp et al 2017 neumann and schliebner 2019 spahr et al 2019 hydrophilic and mobile i e log koc 4 or log dow 4 and persistent i e half lives 40 days in groundwater liu et al 2011 moncada 2004 table s6 these two compounds are also known to persist during soil aquifer treatments hermes et al 2019 therefore the high removals achieved in this research demonstrate the value of engineered geomedia amendments in infiltration systems measurements from the first side port also highlighted the negative impact of the woodchip bioreactor leachate on biochar removal performance fig 3 organic matter measured as doc or microbial biofilm not measured in this study but inferred through changes in concentrations of terminal electron acceptors accumulation on the biochar surface can compete for adsorption sites with the trace organics though precise mechanisms were outside the scope of this research results of previous research demonstrate that organic matter can decrease site accessibility by blocking pore entrances as observed during experiments with other carbonaceous materials i e fouling effect aschermann et al 2018 kwon and pignatello 2005 teixidó et al 2013 during the conditioning phase wbm columns received nearly 40 more doc than their bm counterparts which inhibited trace organic removal results show from 15 to 60 lower removal depending on the trace organic contaminant during the challenge test fig s23 the effect of woodchip bioreactor leachate was not that important in the other studied systems i e wmb wmx and wct abiotic removal of trace organic compounds i e sorption onto biochar occurs via pore filling and sorption mechanisms that include coulombic forces hydrogen bonding and π orbital interactions ray et al 2019 spahr et al 2019 compound hydrophobicity as measured by the octanol water distribution coefficient log dow table s6 or the organic carbon water distribution coefficient log koc table s6 which is an important parameter to describe sorption retarded mobility neumann and schliebner 2019 is not the sole property governing removal of the polar compounds in the challenge test fig s23 for instance the retention of the most mobile compound 2 4 d log dow 0 99 log koc 2 13 confirmed that forces other than hydrophobic interactions played a role in abiotic compound removal however electrostatic repulsion between the ionized carboxylate group on 2 4 d pka 2 73 and the negatively charged surface of biochar and manganese oxides may have facilitated its partial breakthrough kah et al 2017 remucal and ginder vogel 2014 biotransformation also may have contributed to contaminant removal methanol from the trace organic carrier solution also may have influenced the development of microbial communities due to its role as a substrate ulrich et al 2017b moreover parts per million levels of labile organic carbon are not ideal for persistent trace organic biodegradation alidina et al 2014 onesios and bouwer 2012 under this scenario o2 depletion demonstrated that aged columns were biologically active fig s16 and biotransformation has been reported for several of the compounds studied here ulrich et al 2017a wolfand et al 2016 although microbial activity e g transformation pathways was outside the scope of this research fipronil biotransformation to fipronil sulfide has been documented under anaerobic conditions jones et al 2007 or 2 4 d can undergo reductive dehalogenation robles gonzález et al 2006 samples of column effluents indicated that geomedia enhanced the removal of dissolved trace metals figs 4 a b and s24 and table s18 when columns were pre treated by the woodchip bioreactor w columns the effect of the geomedia addition on trace metal removal was significant for all metals except zn p 0 05 tables s19 and s20 the average metal removal in geomedia amended columns followed the order pb cd cu ni zn table s18 results from previous laboratory scale studies indicated that cd ii and pb ii which are poorly solvated due to larger ionic radii were removed well by geomedia while zn was retained less extensively charbonnet et al 2020 liu et al 2005 in the presence of multiple metals zn ii was the most poorly retained trace element in biochar amended woodchip bioreactors ashoori et al 2019 notably when present as co contaminants cd and cu may outcompete zn in biochar amended columns park et al 2015 samples from column side ports after 200 pore volumes suggested that adsorption and or co precipitation processes removed metal ions figs 4c f and s25 in the absence of sulfate reducing conditions i e woodchip pre treated w columns fig s20 adsorption to weathered manganese oxides was likely the main mechanism responsible for metal removal charbonnet et al 2020 aged biochar did not improve metal removal compared to the sand control for ni zn and cd and low reactivity was observed for cu c c0 0 7 metal removal generally increased during the final stages of the challenge tests for the columns that did not receive woodchip pre treatment during the conditioning phase bm mb mx and ct which received lower doc figs 4 and s24 assuming that all the sulfate was reduced to h2s and hs as would be expected based on the removal of oxygen and nitrate and the disappearance of sulfate fig s20 the stormwater may have been supersaturated with respect to metal sulfides for each of the trace metal species see supplementary material challenge test trace metals for further details under sulfate reducing conditions we presume sulfide mineral precipitation explains the decreases in dissolved ni cu zn and pb observed at 200 pore volumes for all of the treatments ashoori et al 2019 jong and parry 2003 however sulfidic conditions did not influence trace organic removal to the same extent as trace metals figs 2 and 3 nevertheless the metal sulfide precipitates could re dissolve after a shift in redox conditions schipper et al 2010 as previously noted sulfate reducing conditions should be avoided as sulfide ion is potentially toxic and corrosive in addition such conditions could dissolve manganese and iron oxides fig s26 contributing to turbidity or clogging kouzbour et al 2020 nonetheless we did not observe clogging in our columns chemical analysis of the geomedia after the challenge test indicated that the manganese oxide coated sand lost much of its coating density and reactivity over the course of the experiment fig 5 a regeneration experiment applying 0 04 m mno4 on the exhausted manganese oxides showed that a decrease of the geomedia mn oxide coating density is permanent however the mn oxidation state was almost completely restored to that of the virgin manganese oxide coated sand a preceding layer of biochar i e arrangement bm protected the manganese oxides from exposure to oxidizable organic carbon e g in nom that reduced the mn iv layer the use of equivalently sized sand and biochar 0 6 0 85 mm resulted in efficient trace organic contaminant removal without appreciable clogging during the experiment overcoming the tradeoff between reactivity and particle size corwin and summers 2010 kang et al 2018 although the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat in geomedia amended columns was lower than that of the sand controls fig s27 this reduction of ksat was less than values observed by researchers who used smaller biochar particles ray et al 2019 trifunovic et al 2018 3 3 environmental implications it is essential to consider issues related to lifespan and maintenance if the pilot scale system is to be employed in practice to assess the potential for field scale deployment of geomedia enhanced stormwater treatment trains we estimated treatment capacity using the data from our study as detailed in the supplementary materials although the iron enhanced filter clogged due to the continuous flow conditions this treatment unit is a well established approach for removing p erickson et al 2017 2012 and could likely be adapted for the treatment train assuming that the clogging could be addressed e g by operating under intermittent conditions and storing treated water in a pond we used reported values of maximum adsorption capacity erickson et al 2017 to estimate a 10 year service life before media exhaustion with routine anticlogging maintenance an appropriately sized woodchip bioreactor would last for nearly two decades see supplementary materials the use of remote hydraulic retention time controls halaburka et al 2019 or a small cascade aeration step between the denitrification unit and the geomedia amended filters could be used to prevent sulfate reduction however if an aeration step is not present in a full scale system this could result in different bulk doc trace organic and metal removal in the subsequent geomedia amended biofilters regnery et al 2015 we used data for the most mobile trace organic compound 2 4 d collected from a side port after 200 pore volumes of challenge testing to estimate of geomedia exhaustion times i e the time when c c0 equals 0 5 a stormwater treatment train system employing geomedia in configuration bm the least effective configuration is projected to treat 2 4 d the most mobile trace organic compound without breakthrough for 30 or 12 years without or with woodchip pre treatment respectively table s21 and fig s28 however these estimates should be interpreted with caution because they do not account for physical biological clogging 4 conclusions trace metals trace organic contaminants and nutrients are not removed effectively in conventional stormwater infiltration systems this research is to our knowledge the first long term field validation of a stormwater unit process treatment train that consistently removes toxic trace metals and persistent mobile and toxic organic contaminants the main conclusions are 1 to meet the operational demand of a typical urban runoff stormwater system an iron enhanced sand prefilter would benefit from inlet and outlet monthly maintenance erickson et al 2017 2013 woodchip bioreactors can achieve consistent stormwater denitrification 98 9 g n m 3d 1 and represent a viable long term and cost effective option for pre treatment nearly 20 years of service life however they leach labile organic carbon that can affect the performance of downstream processes in addition woodchip effluent would require a low energy re aeration step prior to infiltration to improve the doc and trace organic removal minimize reductive dissolution of redox sensitive geomedia and to avoid sulfate reducing conditions that can yield hydrogen sulfide along with a trace metal precipitation methane or methyl mercury easton et al 2015 hermes et al 2019 2 the hydraulic performance of the system was stable and target contaminants were removed well by geomedia that had been aged for 8 months in authentic urban stormwater runoff suggesting greater effectiveness for passive stormwater treatment than conventional sand or gravel the best removed metal was for pb followed by cd cu ni and zn metals were mainly removed via adsorption onto manganese oxides while metal sulfide precipitation likely contributed to metal removal under sulfate reducing conditions counterintuitively sulfate reducing conditions were only observed in columns aged without a woodchip bioreactor pre treatment bm mb mx and ct which had lower doc loadings during the conditioning stage biochar amended columns removed polar trace organic contaminants with a retention order of 2 4 d atrazine tcep fipronil 1h benzotriazole diuron under ideal hydraulic conditions assuming no clogging estimated breakthrough times for anionic 2 4 d were over 10 years 3 the commercial greensand tested in this study did not remove trace organic contaminants however the material tested was primarily designed for contaminant removal and operation under unsaturated applications e g treatment of well water high in dissolved metals different mn containing

15388,stormwater runoff capture and groundwater recharge can provide a sustainable means of augmenting the local water resources in water stressed cities while simultaneously mitigating flood risk provided that these processes do not compromise groundwater quality we developed and tested for one year an innovative pilot scale stormwater treatment train that employs cost effective engineered geomedia in a continuous flow unit process system to remove contaminants from urban runoff during aquifer recharge the system consisted of an iron enhanced sand filter for phosphate removal a woodchip bioreactor for nitrate removal coupled to an aeration step and columns packed with different configurations of biochar and manganese oxide containing sand to remove trace metals and persistent mobile and toxic trace organic contaminants during conditioning with authentic stormwater runoff over an extended period 8 months the woodchip bioreactor removed 98 of the influent nitrate 9 g n m 3 d 1 while phosphate broke through the iron enhanced sand filter during the challenge test 4 months geomedia removed more than 80 of the mass of metals and trace organic compounds column hydraulic performance was stable during the entire study and the weathered biochar and manganese oxide were effective at removing trace organic contaminants and metals respectively under conditions likely encountered in the field sustained nutrient removal is probable but polar organic compounds such as 2 4 d could breakthrough after about a decade for conditions at the study site graphical abstract

resource that could help meet the demands of water stressed cities through the use of managed aquifer recharge and recovery hamdan 2009 luthy et al 2019 however nutrients toxic metals and polar trace organics are present in urban stormwater at concentrations that pose potential risks to drinking water supplies masoner et al 2019 page et al 2014 green stormwater infrastructure can reduce flood risks and remove numerous contaminants while simultaneously providing ecological and societal benefits mcfarland et al 2019 stormwater harvesting systems increase groundwater recharge and typically include pre treatment then retention basins to ensure saturated infiltration and more recently passive treatment systems fig s1 hagekhalil et al 2014 martire 2018 biofilters treat captured urban stormwater by percolating it through porous media by gravity i e biofiltration prior to surface water discharge or use for aquifer recharge feng et al 2012 hatt et al 2008 however these systems are usually designed for hydraulic performance with contaminant removal as a secondary consideration edwards et al 2016 the most commonly used biofiltration media e g coarse sand amended with mulch improves water quality mostly through removal of suspended solids particle associated contaminants and microbial transformation processes bester and schäfer 2009 some contaminants of urban origin particularly persistent mobile and toxic pmt organic contaminants hale et al 2020 jin et al 2020 may not be adequately removed by such treatments reemtsma et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 several types of engineered geomedia may more effectively remove contaminants during passive infiltration carbonaceous materials e g biochar adsorb trace organic and metal contaminants in stormwater mohanty et al 2018 some manganese oxide coated sands oxidize electron rich organic contaminants charbonnet et al 2018 grebel et al 2016 and adsorb metals during stormwater infiltration charbonnet et al 2020 other cost efficient geomedia like woodchips and iron filings can remove nitrate and phosphate from stormwater erickson et al 2012 halaburka et al 2019 2017 thus reconfigured green infrastructure systems with engineered geomedia could provide a means of contaminant removal by sorption and redox processes grebel et al 2013 many types of geomedia perform well at the laboratory scale however little is known about how different weathered engineered geomedia perform when integrated into a series of continuous flow unit operations subjected to authentic stormwater okaikue woodi et al 2020 field testing has demonstrated that geomedia performance can decline within a few months of operation robertson 2010 in addition combining different geomedia configurations i e unit operations in series or directly mixing geomedia i e within the same unit operation to assess their synergistic or antagonistic effects on contaminant removal is significantly under developed spahr et al 2019 for instance biochar may adsorb natural organic matter and thus prolong the treatment capacity of manganese oxides charbonnet et al 2020 uchimiya et al 2010 conversely reducing conditions stimulated by labile organic compounds in woodchip leachate may dissolve fe iii and mn iv oxide geomedia release adsorbed trace metals and even promote trace metal removal through sulfide precipitation grebel et al 2013 similarly microbial activity could enhance the transformation of some contaminants or could block sites for sorption or abiotic oxidation reactions hellauer et al 2018 portmann et al 2022 finally physicochemical weathering and biofilm growth could lower the hydraulic conductivity of the infiltration system perujo et al 2019 an improved understanding of these contaminant removal factors including geomedia configuration is essential to the design and sustained success of large scale stormwater treatment trains in this study we evaluated the efficacy of engineered geomedia for passive removal of stormwater contaminants over a 1 year period in a pilot scale infiltration system the objective of this research was to test a new approach for integrating stormwater treatment train unit operations for nutrient metals and trace organic contaminants under the saturated flow conditions that may be used for managed aquifer recharge fig s1 this study uses a novel integration of coupled unit operations under continuous flow weathered with authentic stormwater and testing of multiple configurations of biochar and metal oxide geomedia for trace organic contaminant removal different unit process configurations were evaluated during eight months of conditioning with stormwater this was followed by a four month challenge test on 24 weathered geomedia enhanced columns with stormwater spiked with representative contaminants these results significantly expand upon our previous study evaluating the effect of different woodchip bioreactor configurations on the removal of trace metal and organic contaminants at the same site ashoori et al 2019 by integrating multiple geomedia configurations in the previous study no contaminant breakthrough was observed in biochar amended bioreactors and a diffusion limited sorption model predicted decades of service for trace organic removal understanding the effects of extended exposure to authentic stormwater on engineered geomedia various configurations of geomedia unit operations and chemical analysis of the geomedia after challenge testing provide novel insights into the biogeochemical processes relevant during stormwater infiltration and links laboratory studies to full scale deployment of engineered infiltration systems 2 methods and reagents 2 1 field site and water source the pilot scale treatment system was located inside a warehouse at sonoma county water agency scwa facilities in sonoma ca fig s2 this structure moderated temperature i e 18 25 c and provided a dark environment that limited algal growth on exposed tubing urban runoff and stormwater were collected from fryer creek 38 17 15 n 122 27 60 w for the eight month conditioning which is fed primarily by stormwater runoff during winter rainy season and urban irrigation drainage during dry summer season from a mixed residential and commercial development table s1 fig s3 every 2 to 4 weeks stormwater was collected using a pump with a 300 μm polypropylene filter bag on the intake strainer and a 75 μm filter on the intake hose collected water was immediately transferred in a 1500 l polyethylene tank to the warehouse where it was stored in a black 2500 l polyethylene tank the tanks and collection equipment were rinsed with tap water and air dried after every use 2 2 geomedia enhanced unit process system a pilot scale unit process treatment train was built to assess the different unit operations of the stormwater treatment system fig 1 collected stormwater tank 0 was first pumped to an iron enhanced sand filter designed to remove dissolved phosphorus erickson et al 2012 the iron enhanced sand filter was a down flow pvc column 40 cm length 10 cm inside diameter filled with astm c33 grade sand and 5 iron filings iron aggregate provided by connelly gpm inc chicago il by weight for a designed hydraulic conductivity of 0 015 cm s 1 this well established technology served as a pre treatment step for phosphate removal the iron enhanced sand filter drained into a 40 l polyethylene tank tank 1 the flow from this tank was split into thirteen separate lines not shown separately in the figure for clarity one first line passed through a woodchip denitrifying bioreactor 50 cm length 10 cm inside diameter halaburka et al 2019 2017 prior to subsequent pumping through 12 geomedia columns 100 cm length 5 cm inside diameter consisting of sand control or manganese oxide coated sand and sand amended with biochar fig s4 another 12 lines flowed directly to identical geomedia treatment columns fig 1 each column group with and without the woodchip bioreactor nitrate pre treatment consisted of triplicates of three different biochar and manganese oxide coated sand configurations and sand controls mixed biochar manganese oxide coated sand designated mx 45 cm layers of biochar prior to manganese oxide coated sand designated bm and 45 cm layers of manganese oxide coated sand before biochar designated mb columns in which the woodchip bioreactor was employed prior to geomedia treatment were designated with a w prefix a total of 24 geomedia packed pvc columns fig 1 were employed in this study the columns exceeded the minimum ratio of column to particle diameter i e 50 1 recommended to avoid preferential flow pathways due to wall effects lang et al 1993 geomedia columns were operated in continuous upflow mode to facilitate saturated conditions throughout the experiments because saturated conditions are likely to be employed in large scale treatment systems ashoori et al 2019 the biochar was obtained from mountain crest gardens etna ca and exhibited a n2 b e t surface area of 318 m2 g 1 ulrich et al 2015 it was sieved through a 20 30 mesh 0 6 0 85 mm and mixed at 1 wt with 20 30 mesh ottawa sand manganese greensand was obtained from greensandplus 18 60 mesh clayton nj and was sieved to remove 30 mesh fine particles prior to use further details on geomedia column characteristics construction and packing material preparation are included in the supplementary material column porosities were calculated gravimetrically after saturation with deionized water table s2 tracer tests with 4 86 mm nabr were used to determine the hydraulic retention times at the end of the pre conditioning stage table s3 initial pore volumes were measured before challenge testing began and these values were used for reporting throughout the experiment the saturated hydraulic conductivities ksat of the columns were measured throughout the experiment eq s1 fig s5 table s4 using the constant head standard method astm 2006 the mn coating density of the manganese oxide coated sand was quantified by dissolving the coating of a 0 5 g sample with 10 ml of 30 mm ascorbic acid and quantifying dissolved i e passing through a 0 45 µm nylon filter mn by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy the average mn oxidation state was determined by iodometric titration murray et al 1984 finally a wireless sensor internet of things network enabled continuous system monitoring and remote control of the pilot scale system details in supplementary material fig s6 2 3 field conditioning and challenge testing stormwater runoff was introduced into the treatment system during an eight month continuous conditioning period to develop a weathered geomedia simulating one rainy and one dry season of use the iron enhanced sand filter and woodchip biofilter were operated at average volumetric flowrates of 90 and 18 ml min 1 corresponding to a darcy velocity of 68 and 14 cm h 1 respectively geomedia columns were conditioned at a 0 85 ml min 1 volumetric flowrate equivalent to a darcy velocity of 2 5 cm h 1 during the conditioning period the top of the iron enhanced sand filter was regularly scraped to avoid its hydraulic failure due to formation of a biologically active cake layer i e schmutzdecke huisman and wood 1974 following column conditioning a four month challenge test was performed to assess the removal of trace organic compounds and metals the challenge test was conducted using synthetic stormwater see table s5 for composition the synthetic stormwater provided a consistent matrix throughout the test and represented typical stormwater conditions pitt et al 2015 during the challenge test to simulate the authentic stormwater used during the conditioning period the synthetic stormwater used in geomedia enhanced columns that had not received denitrifying woodchip bioreactor pretreatment bm mb mx and ct were enriched with nitrate resulting in 2 6 0 4 mg l 1 no3 n whereas the synthetic stormwater used with columns that were conditioned with the woodchip bioreactor effluent w columns was prepared without supplemental nitrogen fig s7 to initiate the challenge test the columns were acclimatized for 14 days i e approximately 18 to 30 pore volumes with synthetic stormwater then 50 μg l 1 of each the following six persistent mobile and toxic trace organic contaminants were added to the synthetic stormwater 2 4 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid 2 4 d 1h benzotriazole 1h bt tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep atrazine atz diuron diu fipronil fip additionally 50 μg l 1 each of nickel copper zinc cadmium and lead were spiked as their chloride salts the high concentrations of spiked contaminants relative to concentrations typical of stormwater were intended to induce breakthrough within the timeframe of the experiment the actual concentrations of influent trace organic compounds and metals were measured immediately upstream of column inlets to control for any deviation from the nominal concentration due to losses in the storage tank the true influent values were used to calculate removal efficiency for the contaminants i e c c0 the chemical structure physicochemical properties e g partition coefficients reported range and mean concentrations of contaminants in urban runoff and typical urban runoff sources for the contaminants are listed in the supplementary materials table s6 the stormwater contaminants represented a broad range of physicochemical properties e g octanol water distribution coefficient dow values spanning four orders of magnitude and reactivity towards the studied geomedia charbonnet et al 2020 grebel et al 2016 ulrich et al 2015 the stock solutions of trace organic contaminants were prepared in methanol the concentration of methanol in the synthetic stormwater i e 0 05 around 100 mg c l 1 is similar to amounts used in other studies which mainly focused on abiotic removal processes of persistent chemicals ashoori et al 2019 cornelissen et al 2005 ulrich et al 2017b although the additional methanol resulted in dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations that were elevated relative to typical urban stormwater conditions pitt et al 2015 there was no evidence of column hydraulic failure additionally metal stock additions did not influence the ph of the synthetic stormwater stored in tanks during the challenge test tank 1 and 2 7 7 0 4 and 7 7 0 1 respectively and sulfidogenic conditions were avoided by constant aeration in both tanks fig s7 geochemical modeling with visual minteq indicated that no metals were present at concentrations above their solubility limits further details in the supplementary materials every two months all ptfe tubing connections were cleared scouring with a small plunger washed with 1 hcl solution and thoroughly rinsed with milli q water to avoid biofilm accumulation and clogging feed solutions were homogenized by gentle aeration and were replaced weekly to minimize microbial activity 2 4 analytical methods statistical analysis and metal speciation analysis full details on analytical methods used for measuring water quality parameters quantification of trace metals by icp ms and trace organics by lc ms ms together with qa qc data are included in the supplementary materials fig s8 tables s7 s10 3 results and discussion 3 1 field conditioning period 3 1 1 pretreatment columns iron enhanced sand filter and woodchip bioreactor plus aeration both the iron enhanced sand filter and woodchip bioreactor operated during the entire 8 month conditioning period without failure due to clogging although phosphate broke through the iron enhanced sand filter the woodchip bioreactor removed nitrate throughout the conditioning period fig s9 the iron enhanced sand filter removed 3 86 mg po4 3 p per g iron filings only about 16 of influent phosphate supplementary materials eqs s2 and s3 the effluent remained oxic and the filter did not affect other water quality parameters figs s10 to s12 the woodchip bioreactor consistently removed nitrate c c0 0 06 throughout the eight months of conditioning figs s9 to s11 on average 98 of no3 was removed and effluent concentrations remained below 0 03 mg l 1 no3 n normalized for reactor volume the removal rate was 9 3 3 g n m 3 d 1 which was consistent with the performance of similar systems coleman et al 2019 schipper et al 2010 under the conditions tested consistent nitrate removal from stormwater could achieve a decadal service lifetime details in the supplementary materials section fig s13 denitrifying conditions were accompanied by the absence of dissolved o2 in the woodchip bioreactor effluent figs s10 and s11 doc concentrations in the effluent from the woodchip bioreactor ranged from 3 to 17 mg c l 1 an increase from an average value of 4 4 1 2 mg c l 1 in the influent i e tank 1 approximately 18 g c d 1 was released per m3 of woodchip bioreactor volume the woodchip bioreactor also induced partial sulfate reduction figs s10 and s11 based on our field observations we hypothesize that the iron enhanced filter failed hydraulically due to the continuous flow conditions however the 3 86 mg po4 3 p removed per g iron filings falls within the reported ranges for similar systems at the end of their useful life erickson et al 2017 2012 we believe this failure was related to concurrent factors including i physical clogging at the effluent spout not removed by top filter maintenance ii stratification of the thin i e 5 cm pea gravel layer at the bottom of the unit iii development of a rust colored thin crust probably iron ochre on the columns at the end of the experiment fig s14 and iv operating the system under continuous flow conditions at higher rates than tested in previous studies erickson et al 2012 similar issues have been observed in an iron enhanced stormwater filtration system erickson et al 2017 3 1 2 geomedia amended biofilters geomedia containing columns removed 90 of influent doc from the stormwater runoff during the first 2 3 months of conditioning i e up to 200 pore volumes after which time breakthrough occurred fig s15 in contrast the sand control columns had higher effluent doc concentrations during the first 2 3 months of the conditioning period p 0 05 tables s11 and s12 these results suggest that doc removal was mainly due to sorption on biochar or mn oxide and breakthrough occurred after the geomedia surface became saturated microbial respiration likely accounted for a fraction of doc removal during this period largely originating from the woodchips or background stormwater organic carbon and became a more important removal mechanism as the column aged as evidenced by a decrease in effluent dissolved o2 after the initial conditioning period fig s16 influent dissolved o2 concentrations to the geomedia amended and the control sand columns were near saturation though tank 2 had significantly higher dissolved o2 p 0 05 concentrations the average values in tanks 1 and 2 were 7 8 1 3 and 9 0 1 0 mg l 1 respectively effluent o2 concentrations were low for all geomedia containing columns typically 4 5 mg l 1 throughout conditioning effluent o2 concentrations were higher i e 4 6 mg l 1 for the sand controls fig s16 the extent of microbial respiration increased during the first two months of conditioning after which effluent o2 concentration remained steady a simplified mass balance for doc removal and o2 consumption indicated that in the later stages of the challenge test aerobic respiration by microbial communities greatly exceeded doc removal by sorption fig s17 in all of the geomedia treatments including the sand controls the ph of the stormwater decreased by about 0 5 ph units fig s18 the drop in ph in the geomedia columns was consistent with microbial respiration releasing co2 geomedia amended column effluents exhibited lower average ph values than their control counterparts fig s18 though the differences were only statistically significant for layered geomedia columns with woodchip pretreatment tables s11 and s12 due to efficient pre treatment by the woodchip bioreactor geomedia columns that were fed by the woodchip bioreactor received influent nitrate at concentrations below the detection limit i e 0 01 mg no3 n l 1 fig s19 while the influent to the other columns contained an average of 1 4 1 0 mg no3 n l 1 typically about 30 of the nitrate was removed from those columns during conditioning period suggesting that nitrate reducing conditions were present the incomplete nitrate removal in both control and geomedia containing columns suggests that anaerobic conditions were limited to certain regions no column configuration consistently removed phosphate or sulfate during the conditioning stage figs s19 and s20 3 2 field challenge test after eight months of field conditioning the geomedia amended columns exhibited sustained high removal of polar trace organic compounds over 200 pore volumes during the challenge testing figs 2 a b and s21 and table s13 geomedia containing columns attenuated contaminants significantly better than the sand control columns p 0 05 tables s14 and s15 the removal of polar trace organic compounds c c0 lower than 0 25 emphasizes the value of biochar for sorption because results from previous studies indicate that widely used woodchip and straw bioreactors alone cannot remove many of these compounds ashoori et al 2019 concentrations of trace organic contaminants measured in samples collected from the column side ports demonstrated that biochar removed trace organic contaminants more effectively than manganese oxide coated sand figs 2c f and s22 tables s16 17 contaminant concentrations dropped most rapidly in the zones where biochar was abundant i e in the front and back half of the bm and mb columns respectively depth concentration profiles also enabled predictions of contaminant breakthrough time after 200 pore volumes samples from the first side port i e at 25 cm into the column indicate that the sequence of contaminant breakthrough would be 2 4 d followed by atrazine tcep fipronil 1h benzotriazole and diuron fig s23 regardless of woodchip bioreactor pre treatment diuron and 1h benzotriazole are found in urban runoff arp et al 2017 neumann and schliebner 2019 spahr et al 2019 hydrophilic and mobile i e log koc 4 or log dow 4 and persistent i e half lives 40 days in groundwater liu et al 2011 moncada 2004 table s6 these two compounds are also known to persist during soil aquifer treatments hermes et al 2019 therefore the high removals achieved in this research demonstrate the value of engineered geomedia amendments in infiltration systems measurements from the first side port also highlighted the negative impact of the woodchip bioreactor leachate on biochar removal performance fig 3 organic matter measured as doc or microbial biofilm not measured in this study but inferred through changes in concentrations of terminal electron acceptors accumulation on the biochar surface can compete for adsorption sites with the trace organics though precise mechanisms were outside the scope of this research results of previous research demonstrate that organic matter can decrease site accessibility by blocking pore entrances as observed during experiments with other carbonaceous materials i e fouling effect aschermann et al 2018 kwon and pignatello 2005 teixidó et al 2013 during the conditioning phase wbm columns received nearly 40 more doc than their bm counterparts which inhibited trace organic removal results show from 15 to 60 lower removal depending on the trace organic contaminant during the challenge test fig s23 the effect of woodchip bioreactor leachate was not that important in the other studied systems i e wmb wmx and wct abiotic removal of trace organic compounds i e sorption onto biochar occurs via pore filling and sorption mechanisms that include coulombic forces hydrogen bonding and π orbital interactions ray et al 2019 spahr et al 2019 compound hydrophobicity as measured by the octanol water distribution coefficient log dow table s6 or the organic carbon water distribution coefficient log koc table s6 which is an important parameter to describe sorption retarded mobility neumann and schliebner 2019 is not the sole property governing removal of the polar compounds in the challenge test fig s23 for instance the retention of the most mobile compound 2 4 d log dow 0 99 log koc 2 13 confirmed that forces other than hydrophobic interactions played a role in abiotic compound removal however electrostatic repulsion between the ionized carboxylate group on 2 4 d pka 2 73 and the negatively charged surface of biochar and manganese oxides may have facilitated its partial breakthrough kah et al 2017 remucal and ginder vogel 2014 biotransformation also may have contributed to contaminant removal methanol from the trace organic carrier solution also may have influenced the development of microbial communities due to its role as a substrate ulrich et al 2017b moreover parts per million levels of labile organic carbon are not ideal for persistent trace organic biodegradation alidina et al 2014 onesios and bouwer 2012 under this scenario o2 depletion demonstrated that aged columns were biologically active fig s16 and biotransformation has been reported for several of the compounds studied here ulrich et al 2017a wolfand et al 2016 although microbial activity e g transformation pathways was outside the scope of this research fipronil biotransformation to fipronil sulfide has been documented under anaerobic conditions jones et al 2007 or 2 4 d can undergo reductive dehalogenation robles gonzález et al 2006 samples of column effluents indicated that geomedia enhanced the removal of dissolved trace metals figs 4 a b and s24 and table s18 when columns were pre treated by the woodchip bioreactor w columns the effect of the geomedia addition on trace metal removal was significant for all metals except zn p 0 05 tables s19 and s20 the average metal removal in geomedia amended columns followed the order pb cd cu ni zn table s18 results from previous laboratory scale studies indicated that cd ii and pb ii which are poorly solvated due to larger ionic radii were removed well by geomedia while zn was retained less extensively charbonnet et al 2020 liu et al 2005 in the presence of multiple metals zn ii was the most poorly retained trace element in biochar amended woodchip bioreactors ashoori et al 2019 notably when present as co contaminants cd and cu may outcompete zn in biochar amended columns park et al 2015 samples from column side ports after 200 pore volumes suggested that adsorption and or co precipitation processes removed metal ions figs 4c f and s25 in the absence of sulfate reducing conditions i e woodchip pre treated w columns fig s20 adsorption to weathered manganese oxides was likely the main mechanism responsible for metal removal charbonnet et al 2020 aged biochar did not improve metal removal compared to the sand control for ni zn and cd and low reactivity was observed for cu c c0 0 7 metal removal generally increased during the final stages of the challenge tests for the columns that did not receive woodchip pre treatment during the conditioning phase bm mb mx and ct which received lower doc figs 4 and s24 assuming that all the sulfate was reduced to h2s and hs as would be expected based on the removal of oxygen and nitrate and the disappearance of sulfate fig s20 the stormwater may have been supersaturated with respect to metal sulfides for each of the trace metal species see supplementary material challenge test trace metals for further details under sulfate reducing conditions we presume sulfide mineral precipitation explains the decreases in dissolved ni cu zn and pb observed at 200 pore volumes for all of the treatments ashoori et al 2019 jong and parry 2003 however sulfidic conditions did not influence trace organic removal to the same extent as trace metals figs 2 and 3 nevertheless the metal sulfide precipitates could re dissolve after a shift in redox conditions schipper et al 2010 as previously noted sulfate reducing conditions should be avoided as sulfide ion is potentially toxic and corrosive in addition such conditions could dissolve manganese and iron oxides fig s26 contributing to turbidity or clogging kouzbour et al 2020 nonetheless we did not observe clogging in our columns chemical analysis of the geomedia after the challenge test indicated that the manganese oxide coated sand lost much of its coating density and reactivity over the course of the experiment fig 5 a regeneration experiment applying 0 04 m mno4 on the exhausted manganese oxides showed that a decrease of the geomedia mn oxide coating density is permanent however the mn oxidation state was almost completely restored to that of the virgin manganese oxide coated sand a preceding layer of biochar i e arrangement bm protected the manganese oxides from exposure to oxidizable organic carbon e g in nom that reduced the mn iv layer the use of equivalently sized sand and biochar 0 6 0 85 mm resulted in efficient trace organic contaminant removal without appreciable clogging during the experiment overcoming the tradeoff between reactivity and particle size corwin and summers 2010 kang et al 2018 although the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat in geomedia amended columns was lower than that of the sand controls fig s27 this reduction of ksat was less than values observed by researchers who used smaller biochar particles ray et al 2019 trifunovic et al 2018 3 3 environmental implications it is essential to consider issues related to lifespan and maintenance if the pilot scale system is to be employed in practice to assess the potential for field scale deployment of geomedia enhanced stormwater treatment trains we estimated treatment capacity using the data from our study as detailed in the supplementary materials although the iron enhanced filter clogged due to the continuous flow conditions this treatment unit is a well established approach for removing p erickson et al 2017 2012 and could likely be adapted for the treatment train assuming that the clogging could be addressed e g by operating under intermittent conditions and storing treated water in a pond we used reported values of maximum adsorption capacity erickson et al 2017 to estimate a 10 year service life before media exhaustion with routine anticlogging maintenance an appropriately sized woodchip bioreactor would last for nearly two decades see supplementary materials the use of remote hydraulic retention time controls halaburka et al 2019 or a small cascade aeration step between the denitrification unit and the geomedia amended filters could be used to prevent sulfate reduction however if an aeration step is not present in a full scale system this could result in different bulk doc trace organic and metal removal in the subsequent geomedia amended biofilters regnery et al 2015 we used data for the most mobile trace organic compound 2 4 d collected from a side port after 200 pore volumes of challenge testing to estimate of geomedia exhaustion times i e the time when c c0 equals 0 5 a stormwater treatment train system employing geomedia in configuration bm the least effective configuration is projected to treat 2 4 d the most mobile trace organic compound without breakthrough for 30 or 12 years without or with woodchip pre treatment respectively table s21 and fig s28 however these estimates should be interpreted with caution because they do not account for physical biological clogging 4 conclusions trace metals trace organic contaminants and nutrients are not removed effectively in conventional stormwater infiltration systems this research is to our knowledge the first long term field validation of a stormwater unit process treatment train that consistently removes toxic trace metals and persistent

15389,the upgrading of water supply services is calling for more accurate and adaptive numerical models to give insight into actual water distribution systems wdss which underlines the importance of carefully calibrating model parameters due to unavoidable uncertainties in the calibration process such as measurement errors errors in model parameters assumed to be known and local optimum of calibration algorithms calibrated parameters could still contain non negligible latent errors and the calibrated model may not able to maintain its long term accuracy when operating conditions change to solve this problem there is growing interest in adopting data assimilation da methods to utilize more comprehensive information in long term measurements to reduce the impact of uncertainties and maintain the accuracy and stability of calibrated models in this study two traditional calibration methods and four da methods were tested and compared in two wdss with different structures which aims to form a general understanding of the behavior and applicability of different methods the calibration results show that da methods perform better than traditional methods and are more robust to different types of uncertainties which provide an effective way to maintain the long term accuracy of wds models to enable better management of wdss ensemble based da methods such as particle filter pf and inferential measurement kalman filter imkf performed well in the real life system they avoid linear approximation and can better estimate the impact of uncertainties to assimilate accurate correction information of the parameters gradient based da methods such as extended kalman filter ekf and variational bayesian adaptive kalman filter vbakf have lower computational demand but they are found to be less robust when dealing with large system uncertainties and nonlinearities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords data assimilation parameter calibration model uncertainty water distribution systems data availability the authors have shared part of their data in supplementary materials more data code will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change and population growth are causing water scarcity worldwide li et al 2020 calling for better operation and management of water distribution systems wdss under this background accurate hydraulic models are in urgent need by water utilities to support various technologies such as optimal scheduling price and ostfeld 2016 water quality maintenance sitzenfrei 2021 and automatic diagnosis of abnormalities zhou et al 2019 duan et al 2020 to help with better wds management nevertheless it is always challenging for modelers to precisely determine model parameters that govern the behaviors of the systems and describe their dynamics sabzkouhi et al 2022 as wdss lying underground are generally huge in size complex in structure variable in hydraulic state and some of their parameters are not directly measurable or need unaffordable resources to be accurately measured zhou et al 2022 therefore model calibration methods which aim to adjust uncertain model parameters to improve accuracy and decision support capability of a model have been widely adopted by modelers savic et al 2009 divided model calibration methods into three main categories trial and error methods explicit methods and implicit methods trial and error methods walski 1986 adjust model parameters through manual trials which can be easily operated but are time consuming and rely on engineering experience chu et al 2021b explicit methods boulos and wood 1990 convert the calibration problem to positive definite equations by expanding the mass balance and energy equations which require sophisticated math expertise and are incapable of considering measurement errors and quantifying uncertainties du et al 2018 implicit methods consider unknown parameters as decision variables and solve them by optimization algorithms for example gradient based optimization methods take repeated steps to refine parameters according to the gradient information kang and lansey 2011 employed a weighted least squares wls method to calibrate demands and roughness coefficients with a two step sequential approach du et al 2018 separated the known and unknown variables in wds and used a global gradient algorithm gga to solve unknown roughness coefficients despite the relatively fast convergence rates of gradient based methods their performance can be greatly influenced by initial conditions and data pre processing such as meter locations initial values of iteration and parameter grouping strategies kang and lansey 2011 zhang et al 2018 metaheuristic approaches minimize the residuals between simulated values and measurements by stochastically searching the parameter solution space with different search strategies and behaviors do et al 2016 used genetic algorithm ga to give the best estimates of the water demand multipliers moghaddam et al 2020 tested the performance of particle swarm optimization algorithm on the calibration of pipe roughness coefficients these methods can always give a better solution with smaller differences between model simulations and field measurements but they are generally time consuming as a large number of hydraulic simulations are often required in more recent years emerging technologies such as smart water alshattnawi 2017 digital twin conejos fuertes et al 2020 and real time hydraulic simulation abu mahfouz et al 2019 are calling for models that can maintain long term accuracy and adapt to rapidly changing wds conditions abu mahfouz et al 2019 the lack of long term accurate wds models has already become a bottleneck that restricts the upgrading of today s intelligent water supply services for model calibration methods the capability to maintain long term accuracy and reduce impacts from different sources of uncertainties should be further improved to support better management of wds as discussed herein 1 relatively less effort has been paid to reducing the impacts of uncertainties multiple uncertainties such as measurement errors parameter grouping errors hutton et al 2014 jun et al 2022 and errors in model parameters that are assumed as known during calibration could lead to deviation of calibrated parameters from true values jun et al 2022 and little confidence of model simulation results du et al 2018 as suggested by hutton et al 2014 uncertainties need to be demonstrated quantified and reduced during calibration to achieve better accuracy some studies have tried to evaluate the confidence of calibrated parameters díaz et al 2016 sabzkouhi et al 2022 but relatively less effort has been made to reduce the impacts of uncertainties 2 a calibrated model may not maintain its accuracy when operating conditions change due to the high underdetermination of calibration problems and potential measurement errors even if the residuals between simulation results and measurements are minimized under several specific operating conditions the calibrated model parameters may not reflect true physical properties of the actual wds leading to less model accuracy for other operating conditions zhou et al 2018 walski 2019 walski 2000 suggested to use good measurements collected with large head loss over the wds but this often requires hydrant flow tests with sufficient outflow which cannot be done frequently for large wdss simultaneously considering multiple operating conditions lansey et al 2001 is another potential way but the number of operating conditions considered is limited by large computational loads besides the above two approaches benefit little to dynamic parameters such as nodal demands which need to be updated in real time 3 a long term mechanism to maintain model accuracy is still lacking the behavior of real wdss varies over time walski 2019 reflected in the changing of nodal demands reservoir pressures control settings and so on waldron et al 2022 stable parameters such as pipe diameters and roughness coefficients will also change slowly over time due to pipe corrosion and deposits traditional calibration methods require periodic and repeated execution to update parameters which is hard to guarantee timeliness and will increase the burden of model maintenance advances in online metering and communication technologies shafiee et al 2018 have provided us with a new perspective to real time update model parameters with improved accuracy by integrating information from long term measurements however real time measurements are more unstable and may contain larger errors as it is difficult to perform timely and effective data processing to improve data quality therefore the ability of calibration methods to deal with measurement errors is becoming particularly important besides how to efficiently absorb useful information from the vast number of measurements is also challenging to address the above issues data assimilation da methods which synthesize prior knowledge of model states with currently available measurements to provide an optimum estimate of the current model states wikle and berliner 2007 and fuse information from multiple time steps to reduce the impacts of uncertainties were employed in some recent works the ability of da methods to continuously update system parameters and keep track of changes in real systems has led to large scale applications in various fields including atmospheric analysis hydrological forecasting and climatology hutton et al 2014 todini 1999 took the lead in introducing kalman filter kf a representative da method to calibrate pipe roughness coefficients in a wds with simple linear structure while the basic kf can only be used for linear systems extended kalman filter ekf approximates nonlinear systems with tangent linear operators and is applied by shang et al 2006 to estimate nodal demands in a small hypothetical network these studies have witnessed good performances of kf and ekf in the case of constrained system nonlinearity and uncertainty but in highly looped networks kang and lansey 2009 or under large measurement errors shang et al 2006 their effectiveness could be limited ensemble kalman filter enkf simulates model states using an ensemble of parameters derived from monte carlo perturbations and avoids model linearization its effectiveness has been proven in updating water demands for online modeling okeya et al 2014 based on enkf particle filter pf enlarges the ensemble size extends the use of ensemble to non gaussian models and successfully estimates nodal demand patterns in wds models using measurements with specific errors do et al 2017 the above da methods set the covariance of input measurement uncertainties to a constant value but it is difficult to accurately ascertain the actual measurement uncertainties in practical engineering due to various types performances and working conditions of metering instruments the nonlinearity and latent errors of a hydraulic model itself and the underdetermined calibration process also make it difficult for da methods to quantitate the impact of the uncertainties on the model parameters to be estimated aiming at these problems zhou et al 2018 got inspiration from enkf and proposed inferential measurement kalman filter imkf which estimates the impact of various uncertainties and avoids the impact of model nonlinearities by pre calibrating parameters from field measurements as inferential measurements chu et al 2021b calibrated nodal demands with the variational bayesian adaptive kalman filter vbakf which adaptively adjusts the covariance of input uncertainties by approximating the distribution of parameters and estimating the confidence of measurements to sum up to support better management of wds it is expected that a model calibration method can maintain high model accuracy for different operating conditions be robust to unavoidable uncertainties and be easy for implementation with acceptable computational demands great potential exists for the implementation of da methods as they can conveniently integrate real time measurements to reduce the impact of uncertainties and keep the accuracy of model parameters although several independent studies have valuably explored the application of some da methods in specific wdss there is a lack of controlled studies that comprehensively analyze the critical factors affecting their performance and develop a deeper understanding of their intrinsic benefits and weaknesses and our understanding of the behaviors of different methods is rather limited and not generally applicable it still lacks answers to the question of how da methods can be better applied to different wdss under various operating conditions in this study a real life network with synthetic data and a raw water pipeline system with field measurements were used to compare the feasibility and accuracy of two representative traditional methods gaussian newton algorithm gna and tracking state estimator tse and four da methods ekf pf imkf vbakf with different levels of measurement errors it is hoped that this research will contribute to a better understanding of da methods benefit their further applications in model calibration and provide insights for water utilities to choose more appropriate methods for model calibration and maintenance 2 methodology in this section the methods used in the study are introduced including two traditional calibration methods and four da methods the following assumptions are made in this study 1 the locations of flow and pressure meters are known in advance 2 only pipe roughness coefficients c w are considered as unknown wds model parameters to be calibrated since they are relatively fixed allowing clearer comparisons among different methods the tested methods can also be applied to other wds parameters such as nodal demands but the calibration of these parameters is not considered in this study 3 the impacts of unknown leakage valve closure pipeline blockage and other factors in a wds model are not considered basic model parameters such as pipe diameters and lengths are assumed to be known and nodal demands are assumed to be uncertain and are assigned with random gaussian errors in case 1 4 pipe roughness coefficients are grouped in advance to reduce the number of unknowns and make the calibration problem solvable kang and lansey 2011 chen et al 2022 the grouping information matrix g c is defined as eqs 1 and 2 and c w g are the grouped coefficients 1 g c i j 1 i f p i p e i i s i n g r o u p j 0 i f p i p e i i s n o t i n g r o u p j 2 c w g c c w g 2 1 traditional

h c w q kq q c w t r t 1 2 h kh h c w q kq q c w where h kh and q kq are the vectors of n h pressure and n q flow measurements respectively h c w and q c w are vectors of model simulated pressures and flows respectively r t is a weighting matrix describing the confidence of measurements which is set based on the variances of pressure and flow measurement errors σ h and σ q r t d i a g σ h 1 2 σ h 2

2017 in this study 2 1 2 tracking state estimator tse kang and lansey 2009 employed tse for parameter estimation in a small network the iterative formula of tse is similar to gna except that tse updates the parameters only once with measurements from a new time step expressed as 6 δ c w t g j h c w t 1 g c j q c w t 1 g c t r t 1 j h c w t 1 g c j q c w t 1 g c 1 j h c w t 1 g c j q c w t 1 g

model parameters with newly obtained measurements through a prediction correction process as shown in fig 1 an optimal estimation of current model states is given by two main modules namely the prediction module and the correction module for a dynamic nonlinear system e g a wds model the prediction and observation process of its parameters e g c w can be represented by 8 c w t f c w t 1 w t 1 9 z t h c w t v t where c w t is the vector of unknown coefficients at time step t z t is the vector of field measurements f represents the prediction process and it is assumed that f c w t 1 c w t 1 as pipe roughness coefficients are relatively fixed in a short period h represents the relationship between c w and the field measurements which is determined by the nonlinear wds hydraulics w t 1 and v t denote errors in the prediction and observation process respectively and are described by the covariance matrices q t 1 and r t in the prediction module the prior probability density function pdf for c w t can be expressed as 10 p p r i o r c w t z 0 t 1 p t t 1 n c w t c w t t 1 p t t 1 where c w t t 1 is the vector of predicted values and p t t 1 is its corresponding covariance z 0 t 1 is the vector of field measurements from previous t 1 time steps n represents normal distribution in the correction module the likelihood function that describes the dependence of z t on c w t and r t takes the following form 11 p z t c w t r t n z t h c w t r t the posterior pdf which represents the optimal estimate for c w t is proportional to the product of the prior pdf and the likelihood function therefore has the form of 12 p c w t z 0 t p p r i o r c w t z 0 t 1 p t t 1 p z t c w t r t da methods find the optimal estimate of c w t by calculating the expectation of p c w t z 0 t the following four da methods make different treatments to obtain the posterior pdf 2 2 1 extended kalman filter ekf ekf assumes that the posterior pdf see eq 12 is gaussian and minimizes the covariance of parameters p t by computing kalman gain g t in the prediction module c w t t 1 and its corresponding covariance p t t 1 are obtained from previously estimated c w t 1 and its covariance p t 1 13 c w t t 1 c w t 1 14 p t t 1 p t 1 q t 1 then estimated c w t and its covariance p t are given welch and bishop 1995 in the correction module 15 c w t c w t t 1 g t z t h c w t t 1 16 p t i g t h t p t t 1 i g t h t t g t r t g t t 17 g t p t t 1 h t t h t p t t 1 h t t r t 1 where h t is the linear approximation of h generally given by sensitivity analysis liu et al 2017 of the corresponding wds model r t in ekf describes the confidence of measurements given by r t d i a g σ h 1 2 σ h 2 2 σ h n h 2 σ q 1 2 σ q 2 2 σ q n q 2 where σ h and σ q are the variance of pressure and flow measurements respectively 2 2 2 inferential measurement kalman filter imkf imkf was proposed by zhou et al 2018 by pre calibrating the unknown parameters as inferential measurements which avoids linear approximation of wds hydraulics in the correction model and provides an integrated way to consider different sources of uncertainties for example the inferential measurements of c w are 18 c w t i n l h 1 z t where c w t i n l is the vector of inferential measurements eq 18 uses field measurements to pre calibrate c w which can be solved by traditional single timestep calibration methods such as gna after the pre calibration process the latin hypercube sampling lhs method kang and lansey 2009 is used to calculate multiple instances of c w t i n l as an ensemble the average value of the ensemble is used as the final inferential measurements c w t i n l the covariance of the ensemble is calculated as r t i n l which represents the uncertainties of inferential measurements originating from measurement errors and inaccurate pre calibration process the observation equation eq 9 can then be transformed into eq 19 and h is converted to an identity matrix 19 c w t i n l c w t v t i n l where v t i n l denotes the inferential measurement errors with covariance r t i n l the prediction module in imkf is the same as that in ekf see eqs 13 and 14 the correction module in imkf is 20 c w t c w t t 1 g t c w t i n l c w t t 1 21 g t p t t 1 p t t 1 r t i n l 1 22 p t i g t p t t 1 i g t t g t r t i n l g t t 2 2 3 variational bayesian adaptive kalman filter vbakf chu et al 2021b applied vbakf to calibrate parameters in wds models the predictions are also calculated by eqs 13 and 14 the main difference is that the covariance r t is assumed to obey the inverse wishart iw distribution 23 p r t z 0 t 1 i w r t α t t 1 v t t 1 24 α t t 1 μ α t 1 m 1 m 1 25 v t t 1 b v t 1 b t where α t t 1 is the degrees of freedom dof parameter v t t 1 is the inverse scale matrix both α t t 1 and v t t 1 vary with time and can be predicted from the previous α t 1 and v t 1 m is the number of measurements μ is a constant 0 μ 1 b μ i the prior pdf for c w t and r t in vbakf has a specific form 26 p p r i o r c w t r t z 0 t 1 n c w t c w t t 1 p t t 1 i w r t α t t 1 v t t 1 the posterior pdf for c w t and r t can be expressed as 27 p c w t r t z 0 t p p r i o r c w t r t z 0 t 1 p z t c w t r t the variational bayesian approach is used to approximate the posterior pdf and can be realized by minimizing the kullback leibler kl divergence between the approximate pdf and the true posterior pdf simo and hartikainen 2013 after the variational bayesian approximation the equations in the correction module are 28 c w t c w t t 1 p t h t t r t 1 h c w t z t p t t 1 1 c w t c w t t 1 29 r t v t t 1 α t t 1 m 1 30 p t h t t r t 1 h t p t t 1 1 1 31 α t α t t 1 1 32 v t v t t 1 h t p t h t t h c w t z t h c w t z t t r t in vbakf is initially set based on measurement errors as in ekf then the approximation of posterior pdf will adapt r t to different levels of uncertainty during the calibration process 2 2 4 particle filter pf using a large number of monte carlo instances particles to simulate the unknown parameters pf provides another way to obtain the posterior pdf in the prediction module pf simulates c w t 1 with n p particles each particle denotes a specific instance of c w t 1 then the particles are updated through the prediction process under the disturbance of q t 1 r n n the sequential importance sampling sis method is used to calculate the weights of particles arulampalam et al 2002 33 w t i w t 1 i e x p h c w t z t t 2 r t 1 h c w t z t where w t i w t 1 i are weights of particle i at time step t and t 1 eq 33 denotes that a smaller weight will be assigned to particle i with larger residuals h c w t z t after several iterations only a few particles may have relatively large weights while the weights of others would become negligibly small causing the particle degeneracy problem in this study a resampling method based on roulette wheel selection zhong et al 2005 is adopted to address this problem after resampling the average value of particles is calculated as c w t and w t i is reset to 1 n p resampling gradually discards particles with low weights but may reduce the diversity of particles hence a strategy inspired by genetic algorithm ga is applied with the parent particles paired and going through crossover and mutation processes to generate particles used in the subsequent time step 3 case study 3 1 case 1 case 1 compares the performance of different calibration methods with various parameter settings and measurement errors using a real life looped wds with synthetic data as shown in fig 2 the network contains 567 pipes and 480 nodes supplying about 57 000 m3 of daily water through 4 reservoirs according to the network structure and the age and material of pipelines the network is divided into 16 pipe groups shown in different colors in the figure 19 pressure meters and 4 flow meters are installed since c w in practical engineering are difficult to be directly measured to better validate the effectiveness of these methods the true c w of 16 pipe groups are predefined as 140 137 133 90 gaussian white errors are added to nodal demands and the epanet rossman 1999 simulation results of the monitored nodes and pipes which are used as field measurements in the following analysis unless otherwise stated the pressure measurement error variance is set as σ h 0 3 m the flow measurement error variance is σ q 5 and the nodal demand error variance is σ q 30 the sampling interval is 15 min and a total of 168 h 7 days of data are collected the initial values of c w for the calibration methods are set to 115 the measurement errors are relatively large to take extreme errors that may occur in actual wds meters into consideration it is also expected that the performance of different methods can be better displayed and differentiated under unfavorable conditions the root mean squared error rmse between the calibrated results and the true values on the last day i e time step t l 96 to t l considering the 15 min sampling interval where t l is the last time step is calculated to describe the accuracy of results of group i the average of rmses denoted as armse and the max rmse denoted as mrmse of the g groups are used to evaluate method performance 34 r m s e i 1 96 1 t t l 96 t l c w t c w t r e a l 2 35 a r m s e 1 g i 1 g r m s e i 36 m r m s e max r m s e i i 1 2 g da methods use q t 1 and r t to determine the confidence of the prediction process and the correction information respectively see eqs 14 15 and 17 as an example appropriate setting of the two matrices is critical to the performance of da methods the calculation strategies of r t in different da methods are discussed in section 2 2 as the confidence of the prediction process is hard to quantitate q t 1 is often manually determined by engineering experience different values of q t 1 with the diagonal elements changing from 10 7 to 1 0 are tested on different methods and the results are presented in fig 3 in the case of ekf the errors are higher when q t 1 increases the linear approximation in ekf limits its ability to handle the nonlinearity between measurements and model parameters which makes it less robust to the unavoidable uncertainties during the correction process therefore a small q t 1 can help ekf to place more emphasis on the prior information weaken the fluctuations caused by uncertainties and absorb correction information slowly to ensure convergence the applicability of ekf is also limited as its performance is easily affected by the choice of q t 1 in contrast the armses for pf vbakf imkf all show a trend of firstly decreasing to the minimal value then ascending with the increase of q t 1 these methods show the ability to effectively absorb the information in measurements to refine parameters therefore larger q t 1 is allowed to increase confidence in the correction information too large q t 1 has an adverse effect on all the methods as this will lose sight of historical information in the following studies q t 1 is set to 10 7 10 3 10 1 and 10 1 in ekf pf imkf and vbakf respectively an overall comparison of calibration results given by the two traditional methods and four da methods is presented in figs 4 and 5 detailed results can be found in supplementary material 2 due to the existence of large uncertainty the results of gna fluctuate dramatically at different time steps with armse greater than 15 tse improves calibration accuracy to some extent by iterating over different times but the results still show obvious variations such as in group 9 10 and 13 the poor performance of the traditional methods lies in that they are susceptible to different sources of uncertainties such as measurement errors and model input errors e g uncertain nodal demands averaging the results of traditional methods over multiple time steps see green dashed lines in fig 4 which shows the mean of all gna results helps to reduce the impact of uncertainties but this strategy does not provide better accuracy than da methods especially in group 13 and 15 even if the measurement errors are assumed to be gaussian due to the nonlinearity of the calibration process different signs and degrees of errors will show different impacts on the final results therefore averaging the results provides limited ability to reduce the impact of errors furthermore this strategy will be inapplicable if the parameters to be calibrated are time varying e g nodal demands comparatively da methods integrate information from not only the current time step but also multiple previous time steps in a more efficient and accurate way which helps these methods to reduce the impact of uncertainties the fluctuation of da methods results is relatively small and the armses are all below 5 indicating their superiority in handling multi time data and reducing calibration errors ekf provides generally good except for group 9 10 12 and 13 as the linear approximation of ekf limits its ability to handle the complex network structures with large nonlinearity of these groups besides the setting of r t in ekf is based only on measurement errors and neglects the potential influence of linear approximation errors and model input errors which also limits its ability to absorb accurate correction information the setting of r t in pf is the same as in ekf resulting in some particles absorbing misleading correction information sampling a sufficiently large number of particles can reduce the influence of inaccurate particles and ensure an effective approximation of the nonlinear system but the computational loads will be too large to meet the real time calibration requirements in large networks which restricts pf in displaying its advantages of eliminating the interference of uncertainties and nonlinearities as can be seen from fig 4b i j and k pf fails to correctly estimate c w even with a large number of 5000 particles one way to address the problem is to obtain prior parameter values closer to the real values so that the actual situation can be better represented with fewer particles van leeuwen 2010 a similar strategy is applied by imkf using the inference observation process which simultaneously obtains the possible prior values c w t i n l and its covariance r t i n l the use of c w t i n l reduces the complexity of using instances to simulate the nonlinear system while r t i n l integrates different sources of uncertainties to enable more proper assimilation of the correction information vbakf also provides good results with armse less than 3 in this case in vbakf approximating the distribution of c w and r t allows r t to dynamically increase with large uncertainty it reduces the confidence of misleading correction information so the method can adjust c w more stably and accurately to further compare the performance of da methods different levels of measurement errors are also tested the pressure measurement error variance σ h ranges from 0 01 m to 0 9 m and the flow measurement error variance σ q ranges from 1 to 15 the results are presented in fig 6 for calibration algorithms an intuitive expectation is that better accuracy can be achieved using measurements with smaller errors however the calibration accuracy of ekf pf shows an opposite trend when measurement errors are at a lower level as these two methods simply use the variance of measurement errors as r t they tend to give large confidence to the correction process when measurement errors are small however uncertainties caused by inaccurate nodal demands and system nonlinearities still limit the accuracy of correction information which will further lead to large errors in the over trusting correction process manually increasing r t may help these methods reduce the influence of errors to some extent but excessive increases may lead to insufficient absorption of effective correction information so it may be difficult to choose appropriate r t manually when applying these methods more in depth discussions about changing r t in ekf pf can be found in section s1 of supplementary material 1 instead of directly setting measurement errors as r t vbakf and imkf can estimate different sources of uncertainties and their impacts on the correction information which allows assigning different degrees of confidence to the correction process to more adequately adjust c w compared with imkf vbakf s performance deteriorates more with the increase of measurement errors it assumes that r t obeys a certain distribution iw distribution which may deviate from the actual distribution and lead to improper absorption of correction information when complex uncertainties are considered especially with large measurement errors rather than limiting the distribution of r t imkf uses a sampling method to pre calibrate inferential measurements and calculate r t i n l thus different sources of uncertainties can be considered more comprehensively contributing to its better performance with large measurement errors even when σ h 0 9 m and σ q 15 see fig 6d the armse of imkf remains below 5 in this case flow measurement errors do not show obvious effects on the performance of the tested methods in addition to the smaller number of flow meters flow measurements also provide less information to the calibration of c w kang and lansey 2011 however more attention should be paid to the effect of flow measurement errors when calibrating nodal demands kang and lansey 2011 zhang et al 2018 3 2 case 2 in case 2 a real life raw water pipeline system was used to compare the feasibility of da methods in practical engineering as shown in fig 7 a the system consists of two main pipes dn1200 and dn1400 with a daily delivery of about 230 000 m3 the pipes are divided into 11 groups and the roughness coefficient of each group is calibrated separately measurements used for calibration were collected from 1 12 pressure meters located at the pump station xtb1 xtb2 qht1 qht2 jqt xjxq xjb1 xjb2 yjq hbg1 and hbg2 2 two flow meters of each pipeline outlet field measurements from october 2019 to january 2020 122 days with a sampling time interval of 15 min were collected and some data with an interval of 1 hour were pre processed by linear interpolation the initial values of c w for the calibration are set to 100 the number of particles in pf is 5000 the same as in case 1 compared with large scale wdss the case has a relatively controllable condition for verifying the effectiveness of each method as the pipeline system has few uncontrollable disturbances such as unknown leakage and uncertain valve states besides since there are no outflows along the pipelines the nodal demands can be considered as known the demands at all nodes are zero and the flow at the outlet is the sum of the two pipe flows pre tests found that the measurements in this case contain considerable errors which can test the da methods in a less favorable condition due to space limitations the calibrated model simulation results of the four tested methods as well as the comparisons with field measurements are provided in section s2 of supplementary material 1 fig 7 shows c w obtained by the four methods using 9600 measurements from the 21st day to the 122nd day each rectangle in the figure represents c w at the corresponding location and the points within the rectangle represent the calibrated results for different time steps compared with the hypothetic gaussian white measurement errors in case 1 the measurement errors in case 2 are more complex as they are smaller in stable operating conditions but may become significant when operating conditions change see section s2 of supplementary material 1 for detailed comparisons of different operating conditions the worst results are given by vbakf fig 7e with obvious variations the reason could lie in the assumption of vbakf that r t obeys the iw distribution which is quite far from reflecting the true uncertainties in this case besides the more stable looped structure in case 1 allows biased estimation of c w in one group to be compensated by adjusting the values in adjacent groups while the branch network in case 2 is less robust to measurement errors thus deviations in one group may greatly affect other groups under this circumstance the inappropriate estimation of uncertainties will lead to even worse performance better results are provided by ekf fig 7b but fluctuant results still appear in some groups with fixed r t it is difficult for ekf to distinguish correction information that could be misleading due to large measurement errors except for variations in some groups resulting from fixed r t pf gives the second best performance this may be due to the simpler structure and relatively controllable condition of the pipelines which reduces system nonlinearity and model input errors so pf can use sampling particles effectively to cope with the nonlinearity imkf fig 7d provides the best results with very small fluctuations which may indicate better representativeness of the system in different operating conditions as the actual c w are relatively fixed the results given by imkf are also consistent with the engineering experience that raw water pipelines close to water sources or with bends are prone to have larger friction due to sedimentation and creature adhesion the good results indicate the outstanding ability of imkf to handle complex uncertainties and properly balance the historical state with the new measurements it should be noted that some unreasonable calibration results such as c w 50 or c w 160 can be avoided by setting appropriate upper and lower limits as constraints although such constraints are not used in this study to better illustrate the influence of uncertainties and distinguish the performance of different methods we still recommend that a reasonable fluctuation range of c w should be set in advance based on pipeline age material diameter etc this may increase stability and allow faster convergence of calibration algorithms 4 discussions the main objective of traditional calibration methods gna and tse is to reduce the residuals between model simulations and field measurements for complex nonlinear wdss various uncertain factors may cause unstable or inaccurate results during the iteration process neither gna nor tse has the ability to distinguish errors caused by these uncertain factors or reduce them resulting in fluctuant results in case 1 this also limits the applicability of these methods in practical engineering especially when real time hydraulic modeling is required data assimilation methods can achieve better performance as they integrate more comprehensive information from multiple time steps different processing strategies of uncertainties result in different performances of the da methods in ekf the covariance r t is predetermined and remains unchanged over time which underestimated the impact of uncertainties in both case 1 and case 2 vbakf limits r t to a certain distribution which may lead to a deviated reflection of the actual uncertainties when uncertainties have hypothetic distribution and are relatively small in case 1 vbakf can provide good estimation results but in practical engineering case 2 with complex uncertainties the performance of vbakf degrades ensemble based methods imkf and pf use instances particles to represent nonlinear relationships in wdss and estimate the impact of uncertainties by statistical methods pf achieves acceptable results in case 2 but fails to address the problem in case 1 due to the complex structure imkf avoids linear approximation by obtaining inferential prior values of c w before the correction process besides the sampling method used in imkf helps to adjust r t so that misleading correction information is less likely to be absorbed therefore imkf can handle different levels of uncertainty in both case 1 and case 2 there are still improvements that can be made to the da methods for example like other calibration algorithms better parameter grouping strategies help to reduce calibration errors and improve the stability of calibration process chen et al 2022 jun et al 2022 besides the main limitation of pf and imkf is that the sampling process could be computationally demanding especially for large wdss for the medium sized network in case 1 the computing time of ekf vbakf imkf pf to calibrate c w at a single time step are 0 17 s 0 19 s 11 38 s and 22 23 s reflecting the lower computational efficiency of ensemble based da methods i e imkf pf although the computing time is much shorter than the requirements of most online wds models boulos et al 2014 further improvements in computational efficiency can help to improve the applicability of imkf and pf in larger real life networks this can be achieved by better estimating prior values of parameters to reduce the number of instances used further software and hardware improvements can also be made to increase computational efficiencies such as parallel computation hydraulic simulation acceleration and the use of high performance computing platforms and frameworks crous et al 2011 chu et al 2021a particularly for imkf although gna is used in this study to pre calibrate the inferential measurements for specific wdss and calibration requirements selecting a more appropriate pre calibration algorithm may further facilitate the application of imkf in large scale wdss based on the case studies and discussions a practical view of implementing real time wds model calibration with da methods is outlined as follows gradient based methods ekf and vbakf can provide acceptable results under controlled uncertainties with faster computational speed which is preferable for wdns with smaller nonlinearity and fewer uncertainties especially when faster computing speed is required ekf is sensitive to parameter settings e g q t 1 so the choice of parameters when implementing ekf is constrained vbakf can achieve relatively better results in larger wdss with complex structures but the application should be careful when there are multiple types of measurements with significant errors which may deviate from the assumed iw distribution ensemble based methods i e imkf pf can address the calibration problem in systems with higher nonlinearity and more complex uncertainties compared with imkf pf does not need to perform sensitivity analysis or pre calibration thus could have better efficiency when applied to smaller networks with limited uncertainties which do not require a large number of particles imkf is recommended in large complex networks with significant uncertainties as it can better estimate and reduce the impact of uncertainties in wds under the influence of system nonlinearities however the range of applications of ensemble based methods may be limited due to the computational burden of their sampling process 5 conclusions the establishment and application of wds smart technologies require real time hydraulic models that can keep long term accuracy which relies on effective model calibration the feasibility and effectiveness of six model calibration methods gna tse ekf pf imkf vbakf for calibrating pipe roughness coefficients were verified and compared through two cases the results indicate that gna tse are susceptible to latent uncertainties during calibration while da methods are more promising in maintaining the low term accuracy of models as they can utilize more comprehensive information in multi time measurements to reduce the impact of uncertainties ensemble based da methods such as imkf pf can better handle the nonlinearity in wdss and appropriately estimate the impact of large uncertainties from different sources resulting in their good performances in the real life system among the tested methods imkf was found to have wider application prospects as it can give ideal calibration results under different levels of uncertainty with acceptable computational demand improvements and future studies regarding three stages of applying da methods are recommended 1 before calibration optimal grouping strategies of parameters can be further studied to improve the consistency of parameters in a group which can help to reduce grouping errors a combination of da methods with calibration algorithms that do not need to group parameters could also be helpful in engineering applications 2 during calibration this study focuses on zero mean gaussian errors but lacks discussion for reducing errors with non zeros means by refining da methods and their details the impact of errors with non zero means is expected to be further reduced valipour and ricardez sandoval 2021 3 post calibration future research could also be conducted to evaluate the influence of pipe leakage blockage and valve closure on the calibration results of da methods which may also lead to innovative synchronized methods for abnormality detection jung and lansey 2015 it is also suggested that further experiments to apply da methods to calibrate various parameters in wds models can be conducted and more acceleration technologies can be integrated to improve da methods performance in large realistic problems the ability of da methods to capture the system behaviors can also support forecasting risk identification and other analysis in the field of water resources and environments and

15389,the upgrading of water supply services is calling for more accurate and adaptive numerical models to give insight into actual water distribution systems wdss which underlines the importance of carefully calibrating model parameters due to unavoidable uncertainties in the calibration process such as measurement errors errors in model parameters assumed to be known and local optimum of calibration algorithms calibrated parameters could still contain non negligible latent errors and the calibrated model may not able to maintain its long term accuracy when operating conditions change to solve this problem there is growing interest in adopting data assimilation da methods to utilize more comprehensive information in long term measurements to reduce the impact of uncertainties and maintain the accuracy and stability of calibrated models in this study two traditional calibration methods and four da methods were tested and compared in two wdss with different structures which aims to form a general understanding of the behavior and applicability of different methods the calibration results show that da methods perform better than traditional methods and are more robust to different types of uncertainties which provide an effective way to maintain the long term accuracy of wds models to enable better management of wdss ensemble based da methods such as particle filter pf and inferential measurement kalman filter imkf performed well in the real life system they avoid linear approximation and can better estimate the impact of uncertainties to assimilate accurate correction information of the parameters gradient based da methods such as extended kalman filter ekf and variational bayesian adaptive kalman filter vbakf have lower computational demand but they are found to be less robust when dealing with large system uncertainties and nonlinearities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords data assimilation parameter calibration model uncertainty water distribution systems data availability the authors have shared part of their data in supplementary materials more data code will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change and population growth are causing water scarcity worldwide li et al 2020 calling for better operation and management of water distribution systems wdss under this background accurate hydraulic models are in urgent need by water utilities to support various technologies such as optimal scheduling price and ostfeld 2016 water quality maintenance sitzenfrei 2021 and automatic diagnosis of abnormalities zhou et al 2019 duan et al 2020 to help with better wds management nevertheless it is always challenging for modelers to precisely determine model parameters that govern the behaviors of the systems and describe their dynamics sabzkouhi et al 2022 as wdss lying underground are generally huge in size complex in structure variable in hydraulic state and some of their parameters are not directly measurable or need unaffordable resources to be accurately measured zhou et al 2022 therefore model calibration methods which aim to adjust uncertain model parameters to improve accuracy and decision support capability of a model have been widely adopted by modelers savic et al 2009 divided model calibration methods into three main categories trial and error methods explicit methods and implicit methods trial and error methods walski 1986 adjust model parameters through manual trials which can be easily operated but are time consuming and rely on engineering experience chu et al 2021b explicit methods boulos and wood 1990 convert the calibration problem to positive definite equations by expanding the mass balance and energy equations which require sophisticated math expertise and are incapable of considering measurement errors and quantifying uncertainties du et al 2018 implicit methods consider unknown parameters as decision variables and solve them by optimization algorithms for example gradient based optimization methods take repeated steps to refine parameters according to the gradient information kang and lansey 2011 employed a weighted least squares wls method to calibrate demands and roughness coefficients with a two step sequential approach du et al 2018 separated the known and unknown variables in wds and used a global gradient algorithm gga to solve unknown roughness coefficients despite the relatively fast convergence rates of gradient based methods their performance can be greatly influenced by initial conditions and data pre processing such as meter locations initial values of iteration and parameter grouping strategies kang and lansey 2011 zhang et al 2018 metaheuristic approaches minimize the residuals between simulated values and measurements by stochastically searching the parameter solution space with different search strategies and behaviors do et al 2016 used genetic algorithm ga to give the best estimates of the water demand multipliers moghaddam et al 2020 tested the performance of particle swarm optimization algorithm on the calibration of pipe roughness coefficients these methods can always give a better solution with smaller differences between model simulations and field measurements but they are generally time consuming as a large number of hydraulic simulations are often required in more recent years emerging technologies such as smart water alshattnawi 2017 digital twin conejos fuertes et al 2020 and real time hydraulic simulation abu mahfouz et al 2019 are calling for models that can maintain long term accuracy and adapt to rapidly changing wds conditions abu mahfouz et al 2019 the lack of long term accurate wds models has already become a bottleneck that restricts the upgrading of today s intelligent water supply services for model calibration methods the capability to maintain long term accuracy and reduce impacts from different sources of uncertainties should be further improved to support better management of wds as discussed herein 1 relatively less effort has been paid to reducing the impacts of uncertainties multiple uncertainties such as measurement errors parameter grouping errors hutton et al 2014 jun et al 2022 and errors in model parameters that are assumed as known during calibration could lead to deviation of calibrated parameters from true values jun et al 2022 and little confidence of model simulation results du et al 2018 as suggested by hutton et al 2014 uncertainties need to be demonstrated quantified and reduced during calibration to achieve better accuracy some studies have tried to evaluate the confidence of calibrated parameters díaz et al 2016 sabzkouhi et al 2022 but relatively less effort has been made to reduce the impacts of uncertainties 2 a calibrated model may not maintain its accuracy when operating conditions change due to the high underdetermination of calibration problems and potential measurement errors even if the residuals between simulation results and measurements are minimized under several specific operating conditions the calibrated model parameters may not reflect true physical properties of the actual wds leading to less model accuracy for other operating conditions zhou et al 2018 walski 2019 walski 2000 suggested to use good measurements collected with large head loss over the wds but this often requires hydrant flow tests with sufficient outflow which cannot be done frequently for large wdss simultaneously considering multiple operating conditions lansey et al 2001 is another potential way but the number of operating conditions considered is limited by large computational loads besides the above two approaches benefit little to dynamic parameters such as nodal demands which need to be updated in real time 3 a long term mechanism to maintain model accuracy is still lacking the behavior of real wdss varies over time walski 2019 reflected in the changing of nodal demands reservoir pressures control settings and so on waldron et al 2022 stable parameters such as pipe diameters and roughness coefficients will also change slowly over time due to pipe corrosion and deposits traditional calibration methods require periodic and repeated execution to update parameters which is hard to guarantee timeliness and will increase the burden of model maintenance advances in online metering and communication technologies shafiee et al 2018 have provided us with a new perspective to real time update model parameters with improved accuracy by integrating information from long term measurements however real time measurements are more unstable and may contain larger errors as it is difficult to perform timely and effective data processing to improve data quality therefore the ability of calibration methods to deal with measurement errors is becoming particularly important besides how to efficiently absorb useful information from the vast number of measurements is also challenging to address the above issues data assimilation da methods which synthesize prior knowledge of model states with currently available measurements to provide an optimum estimate of the current model states wikle and berliner 2007 and fuse information from multiple time steps to reduce the impacts of uncertainties were employed in some recent works the ability of da methods to continuously update system parameters and keep track of changes in real systems has led to large scale applications in various fields including atmospheric analysis hydrological forecasting and climatology hutton et al 2014 todini 1999 took the lead in introducing kalman filter kf a representative da method to calibrate pipe roughness coefficients in a wds with simple linear structure while the basic kf can only be used for linear systems extended kalman filter ekf approximates nonlinear systems with tangent linear operators and is applied by shang et al 2006 to estimate nodal demands in a small hypothetical network these studies have witnessed good performances of kf and ekf in the case of constrained system nonlinearity and uncertainty but in highly looped networks kang and lansey 2009 or under large measurement errors shang et al 2006 their effectiveness could be limited ensemble kalman filter enkf simulates model states using an ensemble of parameters derived from monte carlo perturbations and avoids model linearization its effectiveness has been proven in updating water demands for online modeling okeya et al 2014 based on enkf particle filter pf enlarges the ensemble size extends the use of ensemble to non gaussian models and successfully estimates nodal demand patterns in wds models using measurements with specific errors do et al 2017 the above da methods set the covariance of input measurement uncertainties to a constant value but it is difficult to accurately ascertain the actual measurement uncertainties in practical engineering due to various types performances and working conditions of metering instruments the nonlinearity and latent errors of a hydraulic model itself and the underdetermined calibration process also make it difficult for da methods to quantitate the impact of the uncertainties on the model parameters to be estimated aiming at these problems zhou et al 2018 got inspiration from enkf and proposed inferential measurement kalman filter imkf which estimates the impact of various uncertainties and avoids the impact of model nonlinearities by pre calibrating parameters from field measurements as inferential measurements chu et al 2021b calibrated nodal demands with the variational bayesian adaptive kalman filter vbakf which adaptively adjusts the covariance of input uncertainties by approximating the distribution of parameters and estimating the confidence of measurements to sum up to support better management of wds it is expected that a model calibration method can maintain high model accuracy for different operating conditions be robust to unavoidable uncertainties and be easy for implementation with acceptable computational demands great potential exists for the implementation of da methods as they can conveniently integrate real time measurements to reduce the impact of uncertainties and keep the accuracy of model parameters although several independent studies have valuably explored the application of some da methods in specific wdss there is a lack of controlled studies that comprehensively analyze the critical factors affecting their performance and develop a deeper understanding of their intrinsic benefits and weaknesses and our understanding of the behaviors of different methods is rather limited and not generally applicable it still lacks answers to the question of how da methods can be better applied to different wdss under various operating conditions in this study a real life network with synthetic data and a raw water pipeline system with field measurements were used to compare the feasibility and accuracy of two representative traditional methods gaussian newton algorithm gna and tracking state estimator tse and four da methods ekf pf imkf vbakf with different levels of measurement errors it is hoped that this research will contribute to a better understanding of da methods benefit their further applications in model calibration and provide insights for water utilities to choose more appropriate methods for model calibration and maintenance 2 methodology in this section the methods used in the study are introduced including two traditional calibration methods and four da methods the following assumptions are made in this study 1 the locations of flow and pressure meters are known in advance 2 only pipe roughness coefficients c w are considered as unknown wds model parameters to be calibrated since they are relatively fixed allowing clearer comparisons among different methods the tested methods can also be applied to other wds parameters such as nodal demands but the calibration of these parameters is not considered in this study 3 the impacts of unknown leakage valve closure pipeline blockage and other factors in a wds model are not considered basic model parameters such as pipe diameters and lengths are assumed to be known and nodal demands are assumed to be uncertain and are assigned with random gaussian errors in case 1 4 pipe roughness coefficients are grouped in advance to reduce the number of unknowns and make the calibration problem solvable kang and lansey 2011 chen et al 2022 the grouping information matrix g c is defined as eqs 1 and 2 and c w g are the grouped coefficients 1 g c i j 1 i f p i p e i i s i n g r o u p j 0 i f p i p e i i s n o t i n g r o u p j 2 c w g c c w g 2 1 traditional

2017 in this study 2 1 2 tracking state estimator tse kang and lansey 2009 employed tse for parameter estimation in a small network the iterative formula of tse is similar to gna except that tse updates the parameters only once with measurements from a new time step expressed as 6 δ c w t g j h c w t 1 g c j q c w t 1 g c t r t 1 j h c w t 1 g c j q c w t 1 g c 1 j h c w t 1 g c j q c w t 1 g

model parameters with newly obtained measurements through a prediction correction process as shown in fig 1 an optimal estimation of current model states is given by two main modules namely the prediction module and the correction module for a dynamic nonlinear system e g a wds model the prediction and observation process of its parameters e g c w can be represented by 8 c w t f c w t 1 w t 1 9 z t h c w t v t where c w t is the vector of unknown coefficients at time step t z t is the vector of field measurements f represents the prediction process and it is assumed that f c w t 1 c w t 1 as pipe roughness coefficients are relatively fixed in a short period h represents the relationship between c w and the field measurements which is determined by the nonlinear wds hydraulics w t 1 and v t denote errors in the prediction and observation process respectively and are described by the covariance matrices q t 1 and r t in the prediction module the prior probability density function pdf for c w t can be expressed as 10 p p r i o r c w t z 0 t 1 p t t 1 n c w t c w t t 1 p t t 1 where c w t t 1 is the vector of predicted values and p t t 1 is its corresponding covariance z 0 t 1 is the vector of field measurements from previous t 1 time steps n represents normal distribution in the correction module the likelihood function that describes the dependence of z t on c w t and r t takes the following form 11 p z t c w t r t n z t h c w t r t the posterior pdf which represents the optimal estimate for c w t is proportional to the product of the prior pdf and the likelihood function therefore has the form of 12 p c w t z 0 t p p r i o r c w t z 0 t 1 p t t 1 p z t c w t r t da methods find the optimal estimate of c w t by calculating the expectation of p c w t z 0 t the following four da methods make different treatments to obtain the posterior pdf 2 2 1 extended kalman filter ekf ekf assumes that the posterior pdf see eq 12 is gaussian and minimizes the covariance of parameters p t by computing kalman gain g t in the prediction module c w t t 1 and its corresponding covariance p t t 1 are obtained from previously estimated c w t 1 and its covariance p t 1 13 c w t t 1 c w t 1 14 p t t 1 p t 1 q t 1 then estimated c w t and its covariance p t are given welch and bishop 1995 in the correction module 15 c w t c w t t 1 g t z t h c w t t 1 16 p t i g t h t p t t 1 i g t h t t g t r t g t t 17 g t p t t 1 h t t h t p t t 1 h t t r t 1 where h t is the linear approximation of h generally given by sensitivity analysis liu et al 2017 of the corresponding wds model r t in ekf describes the confidence of measurements given by r t d i a g σ h 1 2 σ h 2 2 σ h n h 2 σ q 1 2 σ q 2 2 σ q n q 2 where σ h and σ q are the variance of pressure and flow measurements respectively 2 2 2 inferential measurement kalman filter imkf imkf was proposed by zhou et al 2018 by pre calibrating the unknown parameters as inferential measurements which avoids linear approximation of wds hydraulics in the correction model and provides an integrated way to consider different sources of uncertainties for example the inferential measurements of c w are 18 c w t i n l h 1 z t where c w t i n l is the vector of inferential measurements eq 18 uses field measurements to pre calibrate c w which can be solved by traditional single timestep calibration methods such as gna after the pre calibration process the latin hypercube sampling lhs method kang and lansey 2009 is used to calculate multiple instances of c w t i n l as an ensemble the average value of the ensemble is used as the final inferential measurements c w t i n l the covariance of the ensemble is calculated as r t i n l which represents the uncertainties of inferential measurements originating from measurement errors and inaccurate pre calibration process the observation equation eq 9 can then be transformed into eq 19 and h is converted to an identity matrix 19 c w t i n l c w t v t i n l where v t i n l denotes the inferential measurement errors with covariance r t i n l the prediction module in imkf is the same as that in ekf see eqs 13 and 14 the correction module in imkf is 20 c w t c w t t 1 g t c w t i n l c w t t 1 21 g t p t t 1 p t t 1 r t i n l 1 22 p t i g t p t t 1 i g t t g t r t i n l g t t 2 2 3 variational bayesian adaptive kalman filter vbakf chu et al 2021b applied vbakf to calibrate parameters in wds models the predictions are also calculated by eqs 13 and 14 the main difference is that the covariance r t is assumed to obey the inverse wishart iw distribution 23 p r t z 0 t 1 i w r t α t t 1 v t t 1 24 α t t 1 μ α t 1 m 1 m 1 25 v t t 1 b v t 1 b t where α t t 1 is the degrees of freedom dof parameter v t t 1 is the inverse scale matrix both α t t 1 and v t t 1 vary with time and can be predicted from the previous α t 1 and v t 1 m is the number of measurements μ is a constant 0 μ 1 b μ i the prior pdf for c w t and r t in vbakf has a specific form 26 p p r i o r c w t r t z 0 t 1 n c w t c w t t 1 p t t 1 i w r t α t t 1 v t t 1 the posterior pdf for c w t and r t can be expressed as 27 p c w t r t z 0 t p p r i o r c w t r t z 0 t 1 p z t c w t r t the variational bayesian approach is used to approximate the posterior pdf and can be realized by minimizing the kullback leibler kl divergence between the approximate pdf and the true posterior pdf simo and hartikainen 2013 after the variational bayesian approximation the equations in the correction module are 28 c w t c w t t 1 p t h t t r t 1 h c w t z t p t t 1 1 c w t c w t t 1 29 r t v t t 1 α t t 1 m 1 30 p t h t t r t 1 h t p t t 1 1 1 31 α t α t t 1 1 32 v t v t t 1 h t p t h t t h c w t z t h c w t z t t r t in vbakf is initially set based on measurement errors as in ekf then the approximation of posterior pdf will adapt r t to different levels of uncertainty during the calibration process 2 2 4 particle filter pf using a large number of monte carlo instances particles to simulate the unknown parameters pf provides another way to obtain the posterior pdf in the prediction module pf simulates c w t 1 with n p particles each particle denotes a specific instance of c w t 1 then the particles are updated through the prediction process under the disturbance of q t 1 r n n the sequential importance sampling sis method is used to calculate the weights of particles arulampalam et al 2002 33 w t i w t 1 i e x p h c w t z t t 2 r t 1 h c w t z t where w t i w t 1 i are weights of particle i at time step t and t 1 eq 33 denotes that a smaller weight will be assigned to particle i with larger residuals h c w t z t after several iterations only a few particles may have relatively large weights while the weights of others would become negligibly small causing the particle degeneracy problem in this study a resampling method based on roulette wheel selection zhong et al 2005 is adopted to address this problem after resampling the average value of particles is calculated as c w t and w t i is reset to 1 n p resampling gradually discards particles with low weights but may reduce the diversity of particles hence a strategy inspired by genetic algorithm ga is applied with the parent particles paired and going through crossover and mutation processes to generate particles used in the subsequent time step 3 case study 3 1 case 1 case 1 compares the performance of different calibration methods with various parameter settings and measurement errors using a real life looped wds with synthetic data as shown in fig 2 the network contains 567 pipes and 480 nodes supplying about 57 000 m3 of daily water through 4 reservoirs according to the network structure and the age and material of pipelines the network is divided into 16 pipe groups shown in different colors in the figure 19 pressure meters and 4 flow meters are installed since c w in practical engineering are difficult to be directly measured to better validate the effectiveness of these methods the true c w of 16 pipe groups are predefined as 140 137 133 90 gaussian white errors are added to nodal demands and the epanet rossman 1999 simulation results of the monitored nodes and pipes which are used as field measurements in the following analysis unless otherwise stated the pressure measurement error variance is set as σ h 0 3 m the flow measurement error variance is σ q 5 and the nodal demand error variance is σ q 30 the sampling interval is 15 min and a total of 168 h 7 days of data are collected the initial values of c w for the calibration methods are set to 115 the measurement errors are relatively large to take extreme errors that may occur in actual wds meters into consideration it is also expected that the performance of different methods can be better displayed and differentiated under unfavorable conditions the root mean squared error rmse between the calibrated results and the true values on the last day i e time step t l 96 to t l considering the 15 min sampling interval where t l is the last time step is calculated to describe the accuracy of results of group i the average of rmses denoted as armse and the max rmse denoted as mrmse of the g groups are used to evaluate method performance 34 r m s e i 1 96 1 t t l 96 t l c w t c w t r e a l 2 35 a r m s e 1 g i 1 g r m s e i 36 m r m s e max r m s e i i 1 2 g da methods use q t 1 and r t to determine the confidence of the prediction process and the correction information respectively see eqs 14 15 and 17 as an example appropriate setting of the two matrices is critical to the performance of da methods the calculation strategies of r t in different da methods are discussed in section 2 2 as the confidence of the prediction process is hard to quantitate q t 1 is often manually determined by engineering experience different values of q t 1 with the diagonal elements changing from 10 7 to 1 0 are tested on different methods and the results are presented in fig 3 in the case of ekf the errors are higher when q t 1 increases the linear approximation in ekf limits its ability to handle the nonlinearity between measurements and model parameters which makes it less robust to the unavoidable uncertainties during the correction process therefore a small q t 1 can help ekf to place more emphasis on the prior information weaken the fluctuations caused by uncertainties and absorb correction information slowly to ensure convergence the applicability of ekf is also limited as its performance is easily affected by the choice of q t 1 in contrast the armses for pf vbakf imkf all show a trend of firstly decreasing to the minimal value then ascending with the increase of q t 1 these methods show the ability to effectively absorb the information in measurements to refine parameters therefore larger q t 1 is allowed to increase confidence in the correction information too large q t 1 has an adverse effect on all the methods as this will lose sight of historical information in the following studies q t 1 is set to 10 7 10 3 10 1 and 10 1 in ekf pf imkf and vbakf respectively an overall comparison of calibration results given by the two traditional methods and four da methods is presented in figs 4 and 5 detailed results can be found in supplementary material 2 due to the existence of large uncertainty the results of gna fluctuate dramatically at different time steps with armse greater than 15 tse improves calibration accuracy to some extent by iterating over different times but the results still show obvious variations such as in group 9 10 and 13 the poor performance of the traditional methods lies in that they are susceptible to different sources of uncertainties such as measurement errors and model input errors e g uncertain nodal demands averaging the results of traditional methods over multiple time steps see green dashed lines in fig 4 which shows the mean of all gna results helps to reduce the impact of uncertainties but this strategy does not provide better accuracy than da methods especially in group 13 and 15 even if the measurement errors are assumed to be gaussian due to the nonlinearity of the calibration process different signs and degrees of errors will show different impacts on the final results therefore averaging the results provides limited ability to reduce the impact of errors furthermore this strategy will be inapplicable if the parameters to be calibrated are time varying e g nodal demands comparatively da methods integrate information from not only the current time step but also multiple previous time steps in a more efficient and accurate way which helps these methods to reduce the impact of uncertainties the fluctuation of da methods results is relatively small and the armses are all below 5 indicating their superiority in handling multi time data and reducing calibration errors ekf provides generally good except for group 9 10 12 and 13 as the linear approximation of ekf limits its ability to handle the complex network structures with large nonlinearity of these groups besides the setting of r t in ekf is based only on measurement errors and neglects the potential influence of linear approximation errors and model input errors which also limits its ability to absorb accurate correction information the setting of r t in pf is the same as in ekf resulting in some particles absorbing misleading correction information sampling a sufficiently large number of particles can reduce the influence of inaccurate particles and ensure an effective approximation of the nonlinear system but the computational loads will be too large to meet the real time calibration requirements in large networks which restricts pf in displaying its advantages of eliminating the interference of uncertainties and nonlinearities as can be seen from fig 4b i j and k pf fails to correctly estimate c w even with a large number of 5000 particles one way to address the problem is to obtain prior parameter values closer to the real values so that the actual situation can be better represented with fewer particles van leeuwen 2010 a similar strategy is applied by imkf using the inference observation process which simultaneously obtains the possible prior values c w t i n l and its covariance r t i n l the use of c w t i n l reduces the complexity of using instances to simulate the nonlinear system while r t i n l integrates different sources of uncertainties to enable more proper assimilation of the correction information vbakf also provides good results with armse less than 3 in this case in vbakf approximating the distribution of c w and r t allows r t to dynamically increase with large uncertainty it reduces the confidence of misleading correction information so the method can adjust c w more stably and accurately to further compare the performance of da methods different levels of measurement errors are also tested the pressure measurement error variance σ h ranges from 0 01 m to 0 9 m and the flow measurement error variance σ q ranges from 1 to 15 the results are presented in fig 6 for calibration algorithms an intuitive expectation is that better accuracy can be achieved using measurements with smaller errors however the calibration accuracy of ekf pf shows an opposite trend when measurement errors are at a lower level as these two methods simply use the variance of measurement errors as r t they tend to give large confidence to the correction process when measurement errors are small however uncertainties caused by inaccurate nodal demands and system nonlinearities still limit the accuracy of correction information which will further lead to large errors in the over trusting correction process manually increasing r t may help these methods reduce the influence of errors to some extent but excessive increases may lead to insufficient absorption of effective correction information so it may be difficult to choose appropriate r t manually when applying these methods more in depth discussions about changing r t in ekf pf can be found in section s1 of supplementary material 1 instead of directly setting measurement errors as r t vbakf and imkf can estimate different sources of uncertainties and their impacts on the correction information which allows assigning different degrees of confidence to the correction process to more adequately adjust c w compared with imkf vbakf s performance deteriorates more with the increase of measurement errors it assumes that r t obeys a certain distribution iw distribution which may deviate from the actual distribution and lead to improper absorption of correction information when complex uncertainties are considered especially with large measurement errors rather than limiting the distribution of r t imkf uses a sampling method to pre calibrate inferential measurements and calculate r t i n l thus different sources of uncertainties can be considered more comprehensively contributing to its better performance with large measurement errors even when σ h 0 9 m and σ q 15 see fig 6d the armse of imkf remains below 5 in this case flow measurement errors do not show obvious effects on the performance of the tested methods in addition to the smaller number of flow meters flow measurements also provide less information to the calibration of c w kang and lansey 2011 however more attention should be paid to the effect of flow measurement errors when calibrating nodal demands kang and lansey 2011 zhang et al 2018 3 2 case 2 in case 2 a real life raw water pipeline system was used to compare the feasibility of da methods in practical engineering as shown in fig 7 a the system consists of two main pipes dn1200 and dn1400 with a daily delivery of about 230 000 m3 the pipes are divided into 11 groups and the roughness coefficient of each group is calibrated separately measurements used for calibration were collected from 1 12 pressure meters located at the pump station xtb1 xtb2 qht1 qht2 jqt xjxq xjb1 xjb2 yjq hbg1 and hbg2 2 two flow meters of each pipeline outlet field measurements from october 2019 to january 2020 122 days with a sampling time interval of 15 min were collected and some data with an interval of 1 hour were pre processed by linear interpolation the initial values of c w for the calibration are set to 100 the number of particles in pf is 5000 the same as in case 1 compared with large scale wdss the case has a relatively controllable condition for verifying the effectiveness of each method as the pipeline system has few uncontrollable disturbances such as unknown leakage and uncertain valve states besides since there are no outflows along the pipelines the nodal demands can be considered as known the demands at all nodes are zero and the flow at the outlet is the sum of the two pipe flows pre tests found that the measurements in this case contain considerable errors which can test the da methods in a less favorable condition due to space limitations the calibrated model simulation results of the four tested methods as well as the comparisons with field measurements are provided in section s2 of supplementary material 1 fig 7 shows c w obtained by the four methods using 9600 measurements from the 21st day to the 122nd day each rectangle in the figure represents c w at the corresponding location and the points within the rectangle represent the calibrated results for different time steps compared with the hypothetic gaussian white measurement errors in case 1 the measurement errors in case 2 are more complex as they are smaller in stable operating conditions but may become significant when operating conditions change see section s2 of supplementary material 1 for detailed comparisons of different operating conditions the worst results are given by vbakf fig 7e with obvious variations the reason could lie in the assumption of vbakf that r t obeys the iw distribution which is quite far from reflecting the true uncertainties in this case besides the more stable looped structure in case 1 allows biased estimation of c w in one group to be compensated by adjusting the values in adjacent groups while the branch network in case 2 is less robust to measurement errors thus deviations in one group may greatly affect other groups under this circumstance the inappropriate estimation of uncertainties will lead to even worse performance better results are provided by ekf fig 7b but fluctuant results still appear in some groups with fixed r t it is difficult for ekf to distinguish correction information that could be misleading due to large measurement errors except for variations in some groups resulting from fixed r t pf gives the second best performance this may be due to the simpler structure and relatively controllable condition of the pipelines which reduces system nonlinearity and model input errors so pf can use sampling particles effectively to cope with the nonlinearity imkf fig 7d provides the best results with very small fluctuations which may indicate better representativeness of the system in different operating conditions as the actual c w are relatively fixed the results given by imkf are also consistent with the engineering experience that raw water pipelines close to water sources or with bends are prone to have larger friction due to sedimentation and creature adhesion the good results indicate the outstanding ability of imkf to handle complex uncertainties and properly balance the historical state with the new measurements it should be noted that some unreasonable calibration results such as c w 50 or c w 160 can be avoided by setting appropriate upper and lower limits as constraints although such constraints are not used in this study to better illustrate the influence of uncertainties and distinguish the performance of different methods we still recommend that a reasonable fluctuation range of c w should be set in advance based on pipeline age material diameter etc this may increase stability and allow faster convergence of calibration algorithms 4 discussions the main objective of traditional calibration methods gna and tse is to reduce the residuals between model simulations and field measurements for complex nonlinear wdss various uncertain factors may cause unstable or inaccurate results during the iteration process neither gna nor tse has the ability to distinguish errors caused by these uncertain factors or reduce them resulting in fluctuant results in case 1 this also limits the applicability of these methods in practical engineering especially when real time hydraulic modeling is required data assimilation methods can achieve better performance as they integrate more comprehensive information from multiple time steps different processing strategies of uncertainties result in different performances of the da methods in ekf the covariance r t is predetermined and remains unchanged over time which underestimated the impact of uncertainties in both case 1 and case 2 vbakf limits r t to a certain distribution which may lead to a deviated reflection of the actual uncertainties when uncertainties have hypothetic distribution and are relatively small in case 1 vbakf can provide good estimation results but in practical engineering case 2 with complex uncertainties the performance of vbakf degrades ensemble based methods imkf and pf use instances particles to represent nonlinear relationships in wdss and estimate the impact of uncertainties by statistical methods pf achieves acceptable results in case 2 but fails to address the problem in case 1 due to the complex structure imkf avoids linear approximation by obtaining inferential prior values of c w before the correction process besides the sampling method used in imkf helps to adjust r t so that misleading correction information is less likely to be absorbed therefore imkf can handle different levels of uncertainty in both case 1 and case 2 there are still improvements that can be made to the da methods for example like other calibration algorithms better parameter grouping strategies help to reduce calibration errors and improve the stability of calibration process chen et al 2022 jun et al 2022 besides the main limitation of pf and imkf is that the sampling process could be computationally demanding especially for large wdss for the medium sized network in case 1 the computing time of ekf vbakf imkf pf to calibrate c w at a single time step are 0 17 s 0 19 s 11 38 s and 22 23 s reflecting the lower computational efficiency of ensemble based da methods i e imkf pf although the computing time is much shorter than the requirements of most online wds models boulos et al 2014 further improvements in computational efficiency can help to improve the applicability of imkf and pf in larger real life networks this can be achieved by better estimating prior values of parameters to reduce the number of instances used further software and hardware improvements can also be made to increase computational efficiencies such as parallel computation hydraulic simulation acceleration and the use of high performance computing platforms and frameworks crous et al 2011 chu et al 2021a particularly for imkf although gna is used in this study to pre calibrate the inferential measurements for specific wdss and calibration requirements selecting a more appropriate pre calibration algorithm may further facilitate the application of imkf in large scale wdss based on the case studies and discussions a practical view of implementing real time wds model calibration with da methods is outlined as follows gradient based methods ekf and vbakf can provide acceptable results under controlled uncertainties with faster computational speed which is preferable for wdns with smaller nonlinearity and fewer uncertainties especially when faster computing speed is required ekf is sensitive to parameter settings e g q t 1 so the choice of parameters when implementing ekf is constrained vbakf can achieve relatively better results in larger wdss with complex structures but the application should be careful when there are multiple types of measurements with significant errors which may deviate from the assumed iw distribution ensemble based methods i e imkf pf can address the calibration problem in systems with higher nonlinearity and more complex uncertainties compared with imkf pf does not need to perform sensitivity analysis or pre calibration thus could have better efficiency when applied to smaller networks with limited uncertainties which do not require a large number of particles imkf is recommended in large complex networks with significant uncertainties as it can better estimate and reduce the impact of uncertainties in wds under the influence of system nonlinearities however the range of applications of ensemble based methods may be limited due to the computational burden of their sampling process 5 conclusions the establishment and application of wds smart technologies require real time hydraulic models that can keep long term accuracy which relies on effective model calibration the feasibility and effectiveness of six model calibration methods gna tse ekf pf imkf vbakf for calibrating pipe roughness coefficients were verified and compared through two cases the results indicate that gna tse are susceptible to latent uncertainties during calibration while da methods are more promising in maintaining the low term accuracy of models as they can utilize more comprehensive information in multi time measurements to reduce the impact of uncertainties ensemble based da methods such as imkf pf can better handle the nonlinearity in wdss and appropriately estimate the impact of large uncertainties from different sources resulting in their good performances in the real life system among the tested methods imkf was found to have wider application prospects as it can give ideal calibration results under different levels of uncertainty with acceptable computational demand improvements and future studies regarding three stages of applying da methods are recommended 1 before calibration optimal grouping strategies of parameters can be further studied to improve the consistency of parameters in a group which can help to reduce grouping errors a combination of da methods with calibration algorithms that do not need to group parameters could also be helpful in engineering applications 2 during calibration this study focuses on zero mean gaussian errors but lacks discussion for reducing errors with non zeros means by refining da methods and their details the impact of errors with non zero means is expected to be further reduced valipour and ricardez sandoval 2021 3 post calibration future research could also be conducted to evaluate the influence of pipe leakage blockage and valve closure on the calibration results of da methods which may also lead to innovative synchronized methods for abnormality detection jung and lansey 2015 it is also suggested that further experiments to apply da methods to calibrate various parameters in wds models can be conducted and more acceleration technologies can be integrated to improve da methods performance in large realistic problems the ability of da methods to capture the system behaviors can also support forecasting risk identification and other analysis in the field of water resources and environments and
