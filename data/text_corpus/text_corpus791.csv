3955,soil and water conservation is the most important among ecological functions of alpine meadow on the qinghai tibetan plateau quantitative assessment of the effects of meadow patch coverage mpc on the runoff and sediment processes in alpine meadow is urgent for predicting the water conservation function of this special alpine ecosystem here a field experiment was conducted to determine the effects of different meadow patch coverage through runoff and sediment processes in a typical alpine meadow on the eastern qinghai tibetan plateau the results showed that runoff in 30 and 60 mpc plots were 39 4 and 37 9 less than in 90 mpc plot respectively the sediment yield in 60 and 90 mpc plots were 77 9 and 82 1 less than in 30 mpc plot respectively the sediment concentration in 30 mpc in heavy rainfall scenario is 4 34 times and 6 51 times higher than that in light rainfall scenario and moderate rainfall scenario respectively our results indicated that mpc presented a greater impact on sediment yield than runoff volume although runoff was greatly affected by rainfall the higher mpc followed the greater runoff coefficient and the lower sediment concentration the influences of mpc on runoff and sediment yield in light rainfall scenario and moderate rainfall scenario were weaker than those in heavy rainfall scenario it is necessary to maintain surface runoff while controlling soil loss for realizing the sustainability of alpine meadow ecosystems therefore these findings may conducive to offer a theoretical guidance to achieve the combined goal of soil erosion regulation

of the qinghai tibetan plateau a great proportion of the alpine meadow were facing different degrees of degradation in recent decades zeng et al 2013 dai et al 2020 meadow patch coverage mpc was one

coverage and runoff generation or hydrological processes on site kokkonen and jakeman 2002 hundecha and bardossy 2004 many studies conducted in alpine regions have recognized that vegetation coverage was one of the key factors that influence the hydrological process of the basin dekker et al 2010 wu et al 2020 yang et al 2020 the presence of the meadow patch coverage changed the soil properties li et al 2015 such as soil porosity soil moisture and aggregate stability meng et al 2020 thereby reducing runoff volume and sediment yield de baets et al 2007 indicated that grasslands with a shallow but dense rooting pattern presented the highest erosion resistance potential and highly increased the resistance of the topsoil layer against water erosion in the top soil with an impermeable layer soil water content could increase greatly and provide large amounts of water formed runoff after heavy inputs of rainfall wright et al 2008 detty and mcguire 2010 prior researches confirmed that the mattic epipedon layer of meadow patch coverage directly reduced the impact of raindrops and the adhesion of root system prevented the soil particles from stripping and washing away by runoff jiang et al 2021 therefore the runoff and sediment generation processes become crucial prerequisite to maintain the hydrologic and ecological functions of the alpine ecosystem rouholahnejad and kirchner 2017 fan et al 2019 tracking and understanding the effects of the changes of mpc on soil erosion is important for the soil erosion regulation of degraded alpine meadows on the qinghai tibetan plateau liu et al 2014 as the grassland degradation leads to the increased habitat fragmentation the destruction or even disappearance of some mattic epipedons and the occurrence of uncontrolled soil erosion sun et al 2020 in this study three meadow coverages 30 60 and 90 meadow patch coverage were selected to examine the hydrological response of the soil under the local natural rainfall events the main objective was to evaluate the effects of natural rainfall intensity and meadow patch coverage on runoff and sediment yields in alpine meadow the findings could offer a theoretical guidance to achieve the combined goal of soil erosion regulation during alpine meadow degradation on the qinghai tibetan plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in dari county located south of the guoluo tibetan autonomous prefecture 33 40 1 n and 99 43 6 e qinghai province fig 1 the average elevation of this area is over 4200 m the study area has a cold and semi humid climate and is characterized by low annual temperatures and low annual precipitation precipitation ranges from 486 9 to 666 5 mm yr 1 in the study area which falls during the growing season mostly concentrated in june to september and its distribution decreases from southeast to northwest the average annual temperature is 5 6 to 3 8 and the annual evaporation is 730 to 1700 mm there is no obvious distinction between the seasons in the study area the climate belongs to a typical plateau continental climate that is characterized by the alternation of hot and cold seasons zhang et al 2014 which lasted from 7 to 8 months the regional soil is mainly comprised alpine meadow soil and its distribution presents obvious vertical zonal divisions based on the international classifications of soil texture the vegetation type is mainly alpine meadow and the dominant species are kobresia pygmaea potentilla chinensis and stipa capillata 2 2 samplings and measurements three runoff plots were built on a hillside with an approximately 30 degree slope to avoid the impact of differences between slopes and the original soil properties of the sites on soil erosion three runoff plots were built on the same slope to ensure that the experiment was performed under similar environmental conditions three runoff plots of 2 m 5 m the slope direction was 5 m were built at the same hillside in the experiment point methods for observing the slope runoff process were used zhang et al 2003 to ensure the accurate identification of the runoff source and sediment source in runoff plots both sides of each runoff plot were surrounded by impermeable iron plates with a height of 30 cm and a depth of 15 cm underground a collection tank with a base area of 0 2462 m2 was placed under each runoff plot collected and measured the runoff and sediment yield after each rainfall event the meadow patch coverage of the three runoff plots was 30 60 and 90 a runoff sediment collection device was installed at the end of each runoff plot the experiment was carried out mainly in july and august when the rainy season in the area was concentrated runoff and sediment were collected and measured after each rainfall event surface runoff and sediment were collected in clean buckets at the bottom of each runoff plot after measuring the runoff in the bucket the sediment in the bucket was shaken mixed and then collected in a 500 ml measuring bottle after each rainfall event runoff and sediment samples were collected in bottles from each bucket after letting the bottles sit for a few days the supernatant fluid was poured into a funnel with filter paper to ensure that the sediment in the bottle had been emptied finally the filter paper was placed in an oven to dry the sediment concentration was measured by drying the sediment at 105 and the total amount of surface runoff and soil loss was calculated the runoff coefficient of each rainfall event was determined by the ratio of total runoff to total rainfall 2 3 natural rainfall conditions precipitation was measured using a tipping bucket rain gauge in this experiment the weather station was used to monitor the in situ weather data all the meteorological data were recorded half hourly rainfall was divided into three levels according to the rainfall intensity of short term rainfall contains light rainfall scenario 2 mm h 1 moderate rainfall scenario 2 to 3 9 mm h 1 and heavy rainfall scenario 4 0 to 7 9 mm h 1 since no the greater rain intensity was involved during the monitoring period the rain intensity level of rainstorm large rainstorm extraordinary rainstorm was not studied during the experiment period july 14 to august 25 the detected meteorological data showed that the rainfall ranged from 3 6 to 14 4 mm with a total rainfall of 81 4 mm among them there were six times of the light rainfall scenario with rainfall ranging from 2 8 to 14 4 mm four times of the moderate rainfall scenario with rainfall ranging from 2 8 mm to 10 8 mm one time of the heavy rainfall scenario and rainfall was 8 0 mm 2 4 data analysis all data values were expressed as mean standard error s e the differences in runoff and sediment yields among the different treatments were determined by two way analysis of variance procedure anova all statistical analyses were performed using the software program spss 20 0 spss inc chicago il usa and figures were drawn using origin 9 1 software the statistical significance was evaluated at the 0 05 level 3 results 3 1 effects of rainfall intensity and meadow patch coverage on runoff and sediment yields in the 30 60 and 90 mpc treatments the runoff and sediment yield were the smallest in light rainfall scenario fig 2 fig 3 the runoff in light rainfall scenario was only 6 3 less than in moderate rainfall scenario and sediment yield was 10 2 less while the amount of soil and water losses in the heavy rainfall scenario were much greater than in moderate rainfall scenario and light rainfall scenario the runoff in moderate rainfall scenario was 61 9 less than in heavy rainfall scenario and the amount of sediment was 86 8 less the runoff in light rainfall scenario was 64 3 less than in heavy rainfall scenario and the amount of sediment was 88 1 less in the same rainfall scenario the 30 mpc treatment has the smallest runoff and the largest sediment yield the 90 mpc presented the largest runoff and the smallest sediment yield runoff in the 30 mpc plot was only 2 4 less than in the 60 mpc plot and the runoff of 90 mpc was much 30 and 60 mpc the runoff in the 30 and 60 mpc plots were 39 4 and 37 9 less than in the 90 mpc plot respectively there was only 18 9 less the sediment yield in the 90 mpc plot than in the 60 mpc plot the sediment yield of 30 mpc was much higher than 60 and 90 mpc the sediment yield of 60 and 90 mpc plots were 77 9 and 82 1 30 mpc respectively table 2 fig 2 and fig 3 rainfall intensity and mpc both have significant effects on runoff and sediment respectively p 0 05

2 effects of rainfall intensity and meadow patch coverage on runoff coefficient and sediment concentration in the same condition of mpc the runoff coefficient increased with the increasing of rainfall intensity fig 4 the runoff coefficients of 30 60 and 90 mpc treatments are the smallest in the light rainfall scenario table 2 and the runoff coefficient in the moderate rainfall scenario was the same as the trend in the light rainfall scenario fig 4 while the higher meadow patch coverage followed the lower the sediment concentration fig 5 sediment concentrations in 30 60 and 90 mpc plots were the greatest in the heavy rainfall scenario table 2 fig 5 the sediment concentration in the moderate rainfall scenario and light rainfall scenario showed the same trend with the change of mpc but the sediment concentration of 60 and 90 mpc in the light rainfall scenario was higher than that in the moderate rainfall scenario fig 5 the rainfall intensity and mpc both had significant effects on runoff coefficient and sediment concentration p 0 01 table 1 while the interaction between rainfall intensity and mpc only had significant effects on sediment concentration p 0 001 table 1 but there was no significant effects on runoff coefficient p 0 05 table 1 4 discussions alpine meadow is a critical part of soil conservation and the extensive distribution of sparse vegetation is the important factor for the occurrence of severe soil erosion on the qinghai tibetan plateau sun et al 2020 many studies have shown that runoff decreases as meadow patch coverage increases because vegetation increases the surface roughness of soil thus making it better at intercepting rainfall jeffery et al 2014 our study indicated that the runoff increased with increasing meadow patch coverage in contrast with most previous research results the reason for the different results found in this study due to the dense root system in the alpine meadow area and the soil surface layer was formed by the grass roots interwoven into a dense and compact grass cortex which made the runoff unable to infiltrate in a timely manner and formed excess runoff bonneau et al 2018 in addition the physical integration of the root system with soil particles on the soil surface leads to the formation of surface seals gyssels et al 2005 which gradually reduces infiltration rates and increases runoff rates liu et al 2019 soil erosion on the qinghai tibetan plateau was severe due to the interrelated effects of low vegetation coverage increased rainfall and overgrazing wang et al 2014 sun et al 2018 the study founded that rainfall intensity had a significant effect on runoff p 0 001 table 1 the higher rainfall intensity the more runoff volume is generated in the same condition of mpc fig 2 the logic behind this phenomenon was that the greater runoff volume during the heavy rainfall scenario was associated with a greater transported sediment carrying capacity larger amounts of rainfall produced more runoff at the surface which lead to more sediment transport moreover the splash interference of the raindrops produced by the heavy rainfall scenario was significant and more sediment was also produced as a result of this process cantalice et al 2017 alavinia et al 2019 however with an increase in meadow patch coverage the runoff coefficient increased but the sediment concentration showed the opposite trend which was consistent with many studies for example the higher meadow patch coverage was associated with a smaller sediment yield wang et al 2015 olliver and edmonds 2017 vegetation can retain rainfall reduce the impact of raindrops slow the flow rate of surface runoff and reduce the erosion intensity of surface runoff all of which reduce the sediment yield the presence of vegetation strongly obstructed the movement of sediment this might be due to dense root system of alpine meadow vegetation which contributed to the formation of grass blanket as a result the increasing meadow patch coverage only reduced the sediment yield but not reduced runoff liu et al 2019 after the grass blanket layer intercepts rainfall the kinetic energy of water drops becomes smaller and the impact and dispersion of soil particles were basically no longer available which reduces raindrop splash erosion through the root system the role of anchoring the soil was strengthened to achieve the role of maintaining soil and water this also indicated that the effect of vegetation cover on sediment reduction was far greater than that of runoff reduction therefore there is a vicious spiral cycle of soil erosion under low meadow patch coverage in light rainfall scenario 2 mm h 1 or in 60 mpc rainfall has little influence on the decrease or increase in runoff fig 2 this may be due to large scale fencing networks have prevented the movement of wildlife and increased habitat fragmentation sun et al 2020 sun et al 2021 which resulting in the presence of many depressions between vegetated and non vegetated areas in the 60 mpc plot which can store more rainfall for soil and increase the rainfall infiltration time and the infiltration amount as a result more runoff can be intercepted when the meadow patch coverage decreased from 60 to 30 the increase in sediment yield was the largest which also indicated that there was a critical value of meadow patch coverage between these two values and the sediment yield increased significantly below this coverage fig 3 the runoff and sediment yield increased more significantly when the rainfall exceeded 3 8 4 0 mm h 1 in this study the differences in erosion process among different meadow patch coverage plots were attributed to the presence of mattic epipedons increased rainfall and root systems especially the presence of mattic epipedons can maintain surface runoff store enough rainwater to meet the demands of growth and control soil loss 90 mpc plot showed comprehensive influences on runoff maintenance and sediment reduction in the future more studies should be focused on analyzing the effects of grasslands with different meadow patch coverage on regulating runoff and sediment yield in the condition of higher rainfall intensity based on long term field experiments the analysis of runoff maintenance and sediment reduction performance of different meadow patch coverage is useful and can potentially contribute to achieve the sustainability of ecological systems on the qinghai tibetan plateau 5 conclusions our study determined the effects of the three different meadow patch coverages on runoff and sediment reduction through in situ monitoring experiments the rainfall amounts and meadow patch coverage both significantly affected the runoff and sediment yields as well as runoff coefficient and sediment concentration compared with 30 and 60 coverages the values of runoff greatly increased in 90 meadow patch coverage the higher meadow patch coverage followed the lower sediment yield meanwhile the rainfall intensity presented a greater impact on runoff volume the larger rainfall intensity generally had a greater impact on runoff and sediment yield than the smaller rainfall intensity and the runoff and sediment yield increased significantly when the rainfall intensity exceeds 3 8 4 mm h 1 overall our results emphasize that the alpine meadow patch presented the best regulation benefit sediment reduction and runoff maintenance when the patch coverage reached 90 these findings have potential implications for understanding the effect of meadow patch coverage changes on functions of

and sediment reduction in the future more studies should be focused on analyzing the effects of grasslands with different meadow patch coverage on regulating runoff and sediment yield in the condition of higher rainfall intensity based on long term field experiments the analysis of runoff maintenance and sediment reduction performance of different meadow patch coverage is useful and can potentially contribute to achieve the sustainability of ecological systems on the qinghai tibetan plateau 5 conclusions our study determined the effects of the three different meadow patch coverages on runoff and sediment reduction through in situ monitoring experiments the rainfall amounts and meadow patch coverage both significantly affected the runoff and sediment yields as well as runoff coefficient and sediment concentration compared with 30 and 60 coverages the values of runoff greatly increased in 90 meadow patch coverage the higher meadow patch coverage followed the lower sediment yield meanwhile the rainfall intensity presented a greater impact on runoff volume the larger rainfall intensity generally had a greater impact on runoff and sediment yield than the smaller rainfall intensity and the runoff and sediment yield increased significantly when the rainfall intensity exceeds 3 8 4 mm h 1 overall our results emphasize that the alpine meadow patch presented the best regulation benefit sediment reduction and runoff maintenance when the patch coverage reached 90 these findings have potential implications for understanding the effect of meadow patch coverage changes on functions of soil and water conservation in alpine grassland ecosystem uncited references credit authorship contribution statement yali niu data curation formal analysis investigation writing original draft

3956,waterlogging events in urban areas are becoming increasingly more frequent which has led to tremendous economic losses urban road networks have also suffered heavy interference and destruction due to this type of disaster and the precise assessment of road network vulnerability is an effective measure by which to reduce losses therefore in this study an analytical framework for the assessment of the vulnerability of road networks to urban waterlogging was constructed by using a coupled hydrodynamic model the rainfall patterns in the study area were detected and their impacts on vulnerability are discussed the results show that rainfall events with unimodal bimodal and uniform shape patterns respectively account for 68 08 31 46 and 0 47 of the total number of events considered in this study the coupled hydrodynamic model used in this study is found to have satisfactory applicability for waterlogging simulation rainfall with a unimodal shape is found to have the greatest impact on the vulnerability of road networks while that with a uniform shape has the least among the unimodal shapes mode ii late peak and mode iii middle peak are the most dangerous keywords road network vulnerability rainfall pattern coupled model swmm lisflood fp 1 introduction urban waterlogging induced by rainstorms is one of the most frequent dangerous and destructive disasters worldwide adikari and yoshitani 2009 jongman et al 2012 koks 2018 lai et al 2020 jian et al 2021 these disasters result not only in serious direct property losses e g buildings public infrastructure etc but also in inestimable and increasing indirect losses e g the interruption of public services and economic activities etc in urban areas where property and human activities are highly concentrated mejía and moglen 2010 wang et al 2015 lai et al 2016 li et al 2020a unfortunately the intensity of waterlogging in urban areas has been aggravated in recent decades due to increasingly extreme rainstorms the continuously extending impermeable surface and shortages of drainage system capacity moniruzzaman 2012 mahmood et al 2017 singh et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 all of which introduce great challenges to human society urban road networks have suffered heavy interference and destruction due to the increasing number and severity of waterlogging events barredo 2009 kalantari et al 2019 li et al 2020b waterlogging can easily cause roads to become impassable if the submerged depth is high enough the decreased visibility on rainy days and the reduction of friction between tires and the submerged ground affect vehicle stability and safety and are also the intrinsic reasons for the decline of the performance of urban road networks martinez gomariz et al 2018 bocanegra et al 2020 the traffic congestion caused by urban waterlogging then results in extensive knock on effects like the loss of travel time and increases in travel distances traffic delays traffic costs and other losses to different degrees suarez et al 2005 sabir et al 2008 su et al 2016 pregnolato et al 2017a the assessment of the vulnerability of road networks is an effective means for decreasing the losses induced by waterlogging many measures can be adopted if it can be determined which sections are prone to submersion and which roads have high vulnerability chen et al 2021 galli et al 2021 for example road departments could upgrade and renovate roads with targeted guidelines transport agencies could provide early warning and disperse traffic before rainstorms drivers could choose a more appropriate route or cancel their trips etc the accurate assessment of the impact of urban waterlogging on road network vulnerability is an arduous task this topic reflects the intersection of hydrometeorology and transport disciplines and has attracted the attention of numerous scholars and researchers in recent years for instance there are three main approaches by which to assess the impact of extreme weather on road traffic performance namely observational modeling and experimental studies pregnolato et al 2017a a distributed hydrometeorological forecasting method that uses a simple rainfall runoff model was proposed to determine the vulnerability of roads to floods on a regional scale naulin et al 2013 the development and application of two dimensional hydrodynamic models e g mike21 floodmap lisflood fp etc can further improve the simulation accuracy anees et al 2016 as a result many studies have employed these models to simulate the flow and evolution of waterlogging and discuss its impacts on road networks for example the floodmap was used to evaluate the response time and accessibility index of emergency response agencies to urban emergency areas caused by the failure of road nodes triggered by a flood event coles et al 2017 the city catchment analysis tool citycat a two dimensional hydrodynamic model developed to simulate pluvial inundation at high resolution was applied to urban flood simulation based on which they created hazard maps pregnolato et al 2017b the infoworks flood model was used to simulate the flood depth and then the depth can be regarded as the input condition of a traffic model pyatkova et al 2019 with the further development of research the rainfall return period and rainfall scenarios have been gradually added to assessment frameworks for example the floodmap and flood depth related measurements were used to comprehensively assess the potential impacts and risks of road networks under the impact of five heavy rainfall recurrence periods yin et al 2016 a road network velocity assessment framework was developed to determine vulnerability under two different rainfall scenarios singh et al 2018 further the network vulnerability index nvi was used to assess the vulnerability of the transport system in york england which takes into account the availability and importance of each road connection in the network balijepalli and oppong 2014 the relationship between flood depth and vehicle speed was used to quantify and predict the impact of flood events on emergency services tsang and scott 2020 generally these works greatly enhanced the perception of road network vulnerability and provided application references for disaster reduction hydrodynamic models not only can effectively detect waterlogging locations and estimate flooded areas as well as the inundated depth but can also reflect the hydrological process in urban areas which can reveal exact flooding information for the analysis of road networks numerical simulations that use these hydrodynamic models are also less expensive relative to other approaches e g experimental studies thereby increasing their popularity however most previous studies only utilized a single hydrodynamic model to simulate waterlogging or flooding coles et al 2017 pregnolato et al 2017b pyatkova et al 2019 while the flow in the pipe network has usually been ignored underground rainwater pipe networks play an important role in draining waterlogging and the simulation results may be unreasonable if these networks are not considered for example the inundated area and depth of water may be overestimated if only using a hydrodynamic model for that the water should be in rainwater pipe networks while is counted to aboveground water therefore simulations may be more accurate if a hydrodynamic model is coupled with a model that considers underground rainwater pipe networks paz et al 2016 additionally although the rainfall return period and rainfall scenario of a rainstorm have been considered yin et al 2016 singh et al 2018 the impacts of the rainfall pattern on the assessment have rarely been discussed the rainfall pattern could be used to measure the temporal variation of rainfall intensity and the hydrologic process in urban areas may be different if the rainfall patterns are diverse even if the rainfall return period and rainfall scenario are the same additionally many rainfall patterns have been developed while whether these patterns are in compliance with local situation when designing the rainstorm process remains being questioned therefore taking the chebei watershed in guangzhou city china as a case study the objectives of the present research are 1 to construct a coupled hydrodynamic model that combines the storm water management model and lisflood fp to precisely simulate urban waterlogging 2 to assess the vulnerability of road networks based on the waterlogging information exported by the coupled model and 3 to propose a rainstorm process design method considering local rainfall patterns and discuss the impacts of the rainfall pattern on the vulnerability assessment this study is expected to provide a reference for traffic management flood risk management and the prevention and reduction of natural disasters in the study area and beyond 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the chebei watershed which is located in guangzhou city china and has an area of approximately 100 km2 fig 1 was selected to conduct the assessment on road network vulnerability in the present work the watershed features a subtropical maritime monsoon climate mean annual temperatures of 20 22 c and a mean annual precipitation of 1720 mm the watershed is generally low lying with highly urbanized areas and dense buildings the rainwater piping system is of a relatively low standard and can only receive rainfall floods with a return period of lower than 5 years therefore due to its high rainfall impervious surfaces that constitute 70 of the area low lying terrain and low standards of the rainwater piping system the watershed is usually vulnerable to waterlogging hallegatte et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 for example this watershed experienced a heavy rainstorm on may 22 2020 which resulted in the waterlogging of nearly the whole watershed the maximum inundation depth exceeded 1 m at several highway sections and the waterlogging even flowed backward to the subway station the road network in the chebei watershed is very developed see fig 1 however most of the main roads are distributed in low lying areas making them vulnerable to waterlogging which usually results in road network paralysis the frequent occurrence of waterlogging in this area already poses a great threat to the security of the road network so it is extremely urgent to assess its vulnerability and propose targeted improvement measures 2 2 data sources and preprocessing a digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 8 m derived from the guangzhou land resources and planning commission was used to construct the coupled hydrodynamic model the contours of buildings and structures were sketched and included the dem as the final digital ground model other data sources included land use data from the national geographic center of china pipe network data from the guangzhou water affairs bureau remote sensing imagery from google maps and precipitation data from the guangzhou meteorological bureau an original global information system gis based road network dataset used in this study was sourced from openstreetmap osm https www openstreetmap org which is a free open source editable mapping service created by steve coast and developed by the public and can provide a wealth of map element information considering that it is difficult to obtain the actual speed limits of 3000 road networks in the study area we adopted the design speed to conduct the analysis the general information of the road network as well as information like the road grade and importance tags can be completed according to the following url https wiki openstreetmap org wiki zh hans map features based on this road information the design speed of each road was ultimately determined with reference to the design of urban road engineering an industry standard report published by the ministry of housing and urban rural development of china to fully evaluate the impact of rainstorms on the speed of the road network a speed of 15 km h was designed for small roads with a vehicle capacity of less than 20 km h the design speed of the road network in the study area is also shown in fig 1 3 methodology 3 1 rainstorm design 3 1 1 calculation of the amount of rainfall rainfall is a driving factor of urban waterlogging disasters and it is critical to design a reasonable rainstorm process before waterlogging simulation is carried out the frequency duration and intensity of rainfall determine the destructivity and severity of urban floods wang et al 2017 singh et al 2018 in this study the return period was used to measure the rainfall frequency based on which the amount of rainfall was investigated guangzhou has developed its own design formula of rainstorms to describe the local precipitation characteristics as summarized based on the statistical results of historical rainfall events in guangzhou this formula is given as follows 1 q 3618 427 1 0 438 l g p t 11 259 0 750 where q is the rainfall intensity l s hm 2 p is the return period of rainfall a and t is the duration of rainfall min this formula takes into account a variety of recurrence conditions for rainstorm events of different sizes the technical guidelines for establishment of intensity duration frequency curve and design rainstorm profile jointly issued by the ministry of housing and urban rural development and china meteorological administration in 2014 recommend six durations when determining rainfall pattern i e 30 min 60 min 90 min 120 min 150 min and 180 min after referring to relative researches wu et al 2017 2018 chen et al 2018 yang et al 2021 and considering the amount of rainfall the land surface conditions and the pipe network conditions in the study area the duration of rainfall in this work was set to 120 min the amount of rainfall within 120 min with different return periods was ultimately determined as reported in table 1 3 1 2 rainfall pattern recognition the characteristics of rainfall distribution are closely related to the local conditions of hydrology climate topography and geomorphology therefore the rainfall characteristic may vary considerably in different regions making it challengeable to recognize rainfall pattern there is broad agreement that the determination of rainfall pattern should follow the two principles a the designed rainfall pattern should be representative and coincide with the local situation b it should be simple and convenient to use on this basis many widely used rainfall patterns have been developed keifer and chu 1957 huff 1967 pilgrim and cordery 1975 yen and chow 1980 according to the temporal distributions and peak locations of rainfall molokov and shtigorin 1956 analyzed more than 800 rainfall events and proposed seven rainfall patterns for the first time the seven types of rainfall patterns are shown in fig 2 among which modes i ii and iii are unimodal with early late and middle peaks respectively mode iv is uniform and modes v vi and vii are bimodal it has been widely confirmed that these seven modes can cover all rainfall patterns for short duration rainstorm molokov and shtigorin 1956 the fuzzy recognition method is the most common method used to categorize actual rainfall distributions as one of the seven rainfall patterns chen et al 2015 it provides an important way to solve the non deterministic and fuzziness problem in rainfall pattern recognition the steps for determining the rainfall pattern are as follows firstly the percentage of the rainfall in each time period is calculated by dividing the duration of each rainfall then the fuzzy matrix of the seven rainfall patterns are set up according to the proportion of rainfall in each time period shown in fig 2 finally the proximity degree of each historical rainfall is calculated and each historical rainfall pattern is determined the duration of each selected historical rainfall event is standardized and divided into 10 equal time periods and then the ratio of rainfall to total rainfall in period i is 2 x i h i h z i 1 2 10 where h i is the amount of rainfall in time period i h z is the total rainfall and m is the number of time periods each historical rainfall event has a set of x i for each time period and is expressed as a vector as follows 3 x x 1 x 2 x 10 similarly the fuzzy matrices of the seven typical patterns are represented by the following indicator 4 v k v k 1 v k 2 v k 10 k 1 2 7 the meanings of v ki and x i are similar therefore the closeness of each historical rainfall event can be calculated as 5 σ k 1 1 10 i 1 10 v ki x i 2 k 1 2 7 according to the principle of proximity if the degree of proximity σ k is the highest the vector x is closer to v k and then the rainfall belongs to mode k generally the fuzzy recognition method can recognize the optimal rainfall pattern from the seven typical rainfall patterns for each duration rainfall event 3 1 3 rainstorm process design all the historical rainfall events can be recognized into seven modes of rainfall pattern by the fuzzy recognition method the standardized curves of rainfall process of each rainfall event with 10 periods can be acquired according to eq 3 and these curves can be divided into seven classes according their rainfall pattern based on this we proposed a new method for rainstorm process design considering local rainfall patterns an example of mode i was demonstrated to show how to design the rainstorm process of 120 min with 20 y return period as shown in fig 3 a dozens of standardized curves of mode i with 10 periods were clustered in the same coordinate system then a new standardized curve can be achieved by taking the average of all these curves fig 3b obviously this curve can be regarded as a typical curve of mode i in the study area further we extended this typical curve to 120 min by the spline interpolation fig 3c the amount of rainfall with 20 y return period was distributed based on the extended curve and then the curve of rainstorm process of mode i under 20a return period was finally designed fig 3d curves of other modes under different return periods can be finished by following the same steps 3 2 hydrodynamic model 3 2 1 the swmm and lisflood fp model funded by the united states environmental protection agency epa the storm water management model swmm was initially proposed in 1971 and the current swmm 5 1 outperforms previous versions in terms of hydrology hydrodynamics and water quality simulations rossman 2010 it is capable of simulating runoff quantity and quality in primarily urban areas according to the 1d saint venant equations shahed behrouz et al 2020 the swmm model specializes in simulating the hydrodynamics in rainwater piping systems 1d and this function was used to conduct the numerical simulation of rainwater in the pipe network in the present study benefiting from its open source management secondary development can be conducted in this model therefore this function was also employed to couple the swmm with the lisflood fp model lisflood fp is a raster based hydraulic model first developed by bates and de roo 2000 the model can simultaneously simulate 1d river and 2d overland hydrodynamics using the 1d saint venant and 2d shallow water equations respectively it can reflect the flooding process and result in good prediction of the maximum extent of flooding horritt and bates 2002 sosa et al 2020 the main advantage of lisflood fp is that it can be integrated with the high resolution dems that have recently become increasingly available for floodplain areas it is recognized as a simpler model in comparison to most other 2d models bates and de roo 2000 3 2 2 model coupling and verification to overcome the inability of the 2d model to simulate the dynamic processes in rainwater piping systems i e the rainwater pipe network and urban canal the fusion of the 1d and 2d models was conducted to simulate the rainfall runoff flood process in the urban study area in particular the swmm and lisflood fp model were coupled for the urban waterlogging simulations by using the c platform the one way coupled technique i e the rainwater could spill into ground surface from the manhole but not the reverse was applied in this study the hydrological rainfall runoff process and flow routing in rainwater pipe were simulated by the swmm while surcharged flows that spill onto the ground surface from manholes were routed on the 2d domain via the lisflood fp model wu et al 2017 2018 the models were linked by exchanging information at the connecting nodes manholes a timing synchronization technique was adopted to enable the models to exchange discharge information simultaneously the interacting discharge at each manhole was determined by either using the weir or orifice equations depending on the hydraulic heads at the manhole and the aboveground water surface the coupling steps in the c platform are as follows a extract the overflow information from the swmm result out file and form a bdy file b write the overflow point coordinate files bci and dem file asc c write a two dimensional run file par containing simulation duration time step wet dry boundaries slope threshold of flowing water surface default parameters etc d run the two models and output the results the coupling flow chart is shown in fig s1 in the supplementary document more details of the model coupling can be found in previous publications chen et al 2005 2007 leandro et al 2009 seyoum et al 2012 leandro and martins 2016 wu et al 2017 2018 model validation is requisite after model construction russo et al 2015 thus indirect validation was conducted based on evidence based reports the rainstorm that occurred in the study area on may 6 2017 was selected to verify the model chen et al 2020 the maximum rainfall in 1 h reached 78 8 mm and the total rainfall was 164 1 mm most portions of the study area were flooded after this rainstorm indirect validation was conducted because of unavailability of measured data on flow and water level yin et al 2016 wu et al 2017 2018 chen et al 2018 three sections see fig 4 a two of which were located at the lower reaches of the tributary and the other of which was located at the outlet of the main tributary were selected to analyze the flow fig 4 b reveals that the flow peaks of sections 2 and 3 occurred in the fourth hour while that of section 1 occurred in the fifth hour the flow peak was delayed by 1 h relative to those of sections 2 and 3 which is in accordance with the law of flow in urban river dai et al 2020 shahed behrouz et al 2020 further the waterlogging induced by this rainstorm was simulated using the coupled model fig 4 c indicates that approximately 81 of the historical waterlogging points released by the guangzhou water affairs bureau were exactly located in the inundated area accordingly the coupled model constructed for the study area can be regarded as reliable and reasonable and was therefore applied in the subsequent step 3 3 road vulnerability assessment 3 3 1 threshold determination the uncertainty of the waterlogging depth increases the danger of driving vehicles and the stability and controllability of vehicles in waterlogged areas have been popular discussion topics a critical threshold has been proposed to describe the relationship between the submergence depth and road disruption smith et al 2017 experimentally tested the traction force of full size vehicles in still water at different depths and the results showed that the traction force of the vehicles decreased rapidly with the increase of the water depth based on experimental and analytical data shah et al 2021 developed safety guidelines for the stability of vehicles driving on submerged roadways based on these guidelines small passengers large passengers and large four wheel drive vehicles cannot travel in water with depths greater than 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 m respectively referring to the air inlet height of motor vehicles the critical threshold of the water depth of 30 cm on urban roads has been proposed in many studies yin et al 2016 pregnolato et al 2017a pyatkova et al 2019 therefore in this study the depth of 0 3 m was set as the critical threshold for road disruption 3 3 2 vulnerability ranking road traffic is at a standstill when the depth of waterlogging surpasses the critical threshold however even if the waterlogging depth is below the critical threshold and the road is passable to vehicles the driving speed is bound to be restricted by the waterlogging depth the safety speed of the road network can be updated after the waterlogging depth is determined and different depth levels have corresponding road safety speeds via the use of radar velocimetry the waterlogging depth and driving speed were investigated at six locations in beijing china with serious waterlogging based on the statistical findings du and yang 2011 proposed the hyperbolic tangent function to express the speed attenuation model 6 v v 0 2 tanh w a b v 0 2 where v is the running speed v 0 is the design speed which has different values for different types of road a is the median of the critical depth of water that causes the vehicle to stop and b is the elastic attenuation coefficient that reflects the attenuation rate of speed with the increase of the water depth the value of which is generally between 3 and 5 the smaller the value the faster the speed attenuation the graphical representation of the speed attenuation model is exhibited in fig 5 the r 2 value of the hyperbolic tangent model applied to beijing was 0 86 du and yang 2011 suggesting relatively high model accuracy therefore this speed attenuation model was directly used in the present study due to the similarity between the traffic rules and road materials used in guangzhou and beijing the waterlogging depth of the road network was extracted from the distribution map simulated by the coupled model under 42 rainstorms under six return periods and all seven rainfall types were used in simulations the attenuation model was then used to calculate the safety speed of the road network for the corresponding water depth the safety speed will be less than the design speed under normal weather conditions so a distance matrix was employed to create interaction weights for the vulnerability ranking on a scale of 0 9 according to the study of singh et al 2018 the safety speed under the condition of waterlogging was divided into 10 intervals in order and arranged horizontally then each road level was arranged vertically in increasing order according to the design speed a 10 10 distance matrix of vulnerability rankings was ultimately formed as shown in table 2 weights were assigned to each class according to the change in speed from the normal sequential range of 0 a small change in speed to 9 a reduction in the design speed to 0 i e from 80 km h to 0 the higher the level of the road network the higher the design speed the greater the decrease in the safety speed and the higher the vulnerability ranking for example a design speed of 30 km h would result in a maximum vulnerability ranking of 4 and a design speed of 80 km h would result in a vulnerability ranking of 9 4 results 4 1 rainfall pattern and design rainstorm in this study a total of 213 rainstorm events during 1954 2012 were screened out from the rainfall data provided by the rain measuring station near the study area wushan station for inclusion in the study the interval between two events needed to be more than 120 min and the amount of rainfall of each event needed to be greater than 50 mm as the rainfall durations of these events were different the durations were uniformly divided into 10 intervals for convenient calculation the fuzzy recognition method was used to recognize the rainfall pattern among the 213 events the numbers of rainfall patterns of modes i vii were respectively 81 17 47 1 7 57 and 3 the number of rainstorms with a unimodal shape modes i ii and iii was 145 accounting for 68 08 moreover there were 67 events with a bimodal shape accounting for 31 46 finally only one event had a uniform shape accounting for 0 47 these proportions of rainfall pattern modes are similar to those reported in the study of chen et al 2015 it is evident that rainstorms with a unimodal shape were dominant in the study area while the uniform shape mode iv was sparse the 120 min rainfall processes of 42 scenarios see fig 6 were designed according to the steps in section 3 1 3 and the amount of rainfall reported in table 1 a straight line was used to reflect the rainfall process of mode iv because there was only one sample and it was therefore unrepresentative for this study generally these rainstorm series consider the actual rainfall features and can then be imported for the coupled model in the subsequent step 4 2 maximum depth and inundated area waterlogging simulations were conducted under 42 scenarios and the maximum waterlogging depth as well as the inundated area were extracted by the arcgis platform taking mode iii as an example see fig 7 the uneven distributions of the topography and land use resulted in the unevenness of the spatial distribution of waterlogging especially in the highly urbanized residential and commercial areas where the impact of waterlogging is greater than in other areas although the maximum depth and inundated area increased with the increase of the return period there was a high degree of consistency among the spatial distributions which presented visual similarities under the six different return periods the results based on the other six rainfall patterns see fig s2 in the supplementary document were basically similar generally there were also significant increases in the maximum depth and inundated area when the return period was greater than 5 y meaning that the standards for waterlogging control are quite low and the study area will face a severe threat if no targeted measures are adopted the proportions of inundated areas under the 42 scenarios were determined see fig 8 and table s1 in the supplementary document and it was found that the proportions increased greatly with the increase of the return period the proportions of inundated areas with different rainfall patterns were also different although under the same return period suggesting that the rainfall pattern can impact the waterlogging conditions additionally the maximum inundated areas based on the unimodal shape were larger than those based on the bimodal and uniform shapes among the seven rainfall patterns the inundated area of mode iii was found to be the largest while that of mode iv was found to be the smallest which is consistent with the study of chen et al 2018 moreover the largest difference 2 21 between modes iii and v was found under the 20 y return period generally different rainfall patterns can induce various inundated areas despite a relatively small difference within the same return period however these differences cannot be ignored because they may cause huge losses especially in highly urbanized areas where property and population are highly centralized 4 3 statistics of reduction in speed based on the speed attenuation model the safety speed distribution of the 42 scenarios was analyzed the accumulated and average road lengths in each safety speed interval under different rainfall scenarios as well as under the normal condition no waterlogging were also explored see fig 9 it was found that the road network speed was redistributed due to the waterlogging of the road surface moreover the road length of each speed interval was quite different under the conditions of rainstorms with different return periods and rainfall patterns according to fig 9 for all seven rainfall patterns the average road length for each speed interval was longer under the condition of a lower return period the total road length affected by waterlogging was found to increase greatly with the increase of the return period to compare the effects of different rainfall patterns some speed intervals that the road length is reduced compared to normal weather conditions were chosen to compare the magnitude of road lengths after the road network speed redistribution under each rainfall patterns the speed intervals including 10 15 15 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 and 70 80 were ranked in order from first grade 1 to seventh grade 7 according to the road length the average grade of the selected speed interval in each return period was respectively counted table 3 the results demonstrate that mode ii had the highest average road length grade 5 79 followed by mode iii and mode i respectively while mode iv only had a grade of 1 31 therefore it can be concluded that mode ii has the greatest impact on reducing the safety speed of a road network among the seven rainfall patterns while mode iv has the least influence fig 10 presents the proportions of road length variation in different speed intervals after the redistribution of the road speed as compared with normal conditions the rainfall scenarios with different return periods and rainfall patterns were found to vary greatly in terms of the length of roads as compared to the normal conditions in terms of rainfall patterns similar methods were adopted to compare the proportion of road length reduction under each rainfall pattern the order of the seven rainfall patterns was also similar to the previous conclusion i e the order in which the degree of effects decrease from high to low was found to be mode ii iii i vi vii v and iv the increase of the return period caused the increase of the proportion of the road length especially when the speed interval was 0 this indicates that the increase of the return period caused the proportion of road network interruption to increase sharply from 9 1 y to 40 100 y 4 4 road network vulnerability ranking the spatial distribution of the road network vulnerability rankings and the sum of the corresponding road lengths under the 42 rainfall scenarios were calculated fig 11 presents the spatial distribution of the road network vulnerability ranking under mode iii with the maximum waterlogging depths of different return periods it is evident that the number of roads with high vulnerability increased as the return period increased in addition the spatial distribution of the vulnerability ranking was found to be highly consistent with that of the maximum inundated depth fig 7 other rainfall patterns also present similar distributions see fig s3 in the supplementary document however for the same return period taking 5 y return period as an example fig 12 the spatial distributions of the vulnerability rankings are nearly the same suggesting that the spatial differences induced by various rainfall patterns are insignificant to observe the subtle changes in the vulnerability rankings of the rainfall patterns under different return periods fig 13 and table s2 supplementary document present the total and average lengths of each vulnerability ranking under the 42 rainfall scenarios with the increase of return period the average length with vulnerability ranked 9 surged from 12 51 km to 50 6 km and that ranked 0 dropped from 621 82 km to 414 11 km some decreased and some increased for other lengths with vulnerability ranked 1 to 8 considering that the road networks at high vulnerability ranking are more dangerous than those at lower ranking we adopted a weighted average grade it is worth noting that this weighted average is different from the simple average appearing in table 3 a weighting factor λ was introduced for each road network vulnerability ranking 7 λ i i i 1 9 i i 1 2 9 where λ i is the weighting coefficient when road network vulnerability ranking is i similarly the weighted grades of the road lengths of different rainfall patterns under each vulnerability level were compared excluding the unaffected road vulnerability level of 0 and the average grades of the six return periods were calculated as reported in table 4 the results show that mode iii is the most dangerous rainfall pattern with the lowest grade 2 73 while mode v is the least dangerous rainfall pattern with the highest grade 5 35 finally the average lengths and standard deviations of the vulnerability rankings of the seven rainfall patterns under each return period were calculated as illustrated in fig 14 fig 14 a reveals that the average road lengths of the seven rainfall patterns under various vulnerability rankings generally increased with the increase of the return period for example the average length of roads with a vulnerability rank of 3 increased from 26 28 km 3 6 to 72 98 km 9 9 with the increase of the return period from 1 y to 100 y fig 14 b shows that the standard deviations of the lengths of the seven rainfall patterns slightly increased with the increase of the return period which also indicates that the increase of the return period has no significant effect on the differences among the vulnerability rankings of the seven rainfall patterns in conclusion in terms of the rainfall pattern the unimodal shape has the greatest impact on road network vulnerability followed by the bimodal shape and the uniform shape has the least impact however relative to the rainfall pattern the return period plays a more important role in impacting the vulnerability of the road network 5 discussion the assessment of the vulnerability of road networks is an effective means for reducing road traffic injuries and property damage many improved and remedial measures can be adopted if the vulnerability of road networks is clarified in advance which could greatly decrease the consequential losses due to waterlogging it is an inevitable general trend to conduct accurate and elaborate assessments as the demands for driving safety and property conservation become increasingly higher therefore the information on the submerged conditions and evolution process of waterlogging should be as detailed as possible however most previous studies only used a single hydrodynamic model to simulate surface waterlogging or flooding and usually ignored the flow in the pipe network coles et al 2017 pregnolato et al 2017b pyatkova et al 2019 while these simulations may meet the requirements from a macroscale perspective they are usually not detailed enough for the implementation of improvement measures therefore in this study a coupled model was used to improve this problem the mechanisms of runoff production and flow confluence in an urban area were embedded in the coupled model and the hydrological processes including runoff production flow confluence the rising stage evolution fluctuation and recession were simulated the water both on the surface and in the pipe network is considered in the model which matches well with the actual situation via this coupled model the submerged area the waterlogging depth and the exact location of flooding points can be displayed in detail after which targeted solutions as mentioned in the introduction section can be taken to reduce losses an analytical framework for road vulnerability assessment based on the submerged conditions from the coupled model was also constructed this framework can yield which exact roads are prone to waterlogging as well as the degree of the effect which has important reference value for transport agencies and drivers in the assessment the relationship between the running speed of the vehicle and the water depth of the study area was unclear due to a lack of measured data therefore a speed attenuation model was used to analyze the vehicle running speed this model has been proven to have an ideal effect when applied to beijing and its r 2 value reached as high as 0 86 du and yang 2011 china has released uniform national regulations on traffic guidance and road construction which guarantees uniform standards in other words the traffic rules of guangzhou and beijing are almost the same which indirectly suggests the rationality of the use of the speed attenuation model in the study area in the present work similarly the speed attenuation model can also be expanded to other cities the results also demonstrated that rainfall events with different patterns could lead to relatively large differences in road vulnerability even under the same return period generally rainfall with a unimodal shape has the greatest impact on the road network vulnerability while that with a uniform shape has the least impact among the unimodal shapes mode ii late peak and mode iii middle peak are the most dangerous for the road network as techniques of precipitation nowcasting are becoming increasingly mature it is becoming easier to learn the pattern of a rainfall event two to three hours in advance in this case waterlogging conditions can be predicted and road vulnerability can be pre estimated via the implementation of the coupled model which could provide timely references for traffic management and trip guidance corresponding measures can then be taken during the buffer time and losses could undoubtedly be reduced 6 conclusions the accurate assessment of the impact of urban waterlogging on road network vulnerability is of significance for traffic management flood risk management and the prevention and reduction of natural disasters in the study area and beyond in this study the patterns of rainfall events in the chebei watershed during 1954 2012 were first recognized by the fuzzy recognition method then a coupled hydrodynamic model that combines the storm water management model and lisflood fp was constructed to simulate urban waterlogging finally the vulnerability of the road network was assessed and the impacts of the rainfall pattern were discussed the conclusions of this research can be summarized as follows 1 a total of 213 rainstorm events during 1954 2012 were screened out from the available rainfall data the events with a unimodal shape pattern accounted for 68 08 those with a bimodal shape accounted for 31 46 and those with a uniform shape accounted only for 0 47 2 the coupled hydrodynamic model can consider overland flow 2d pipe flow 1d and their interaction which better reflects the actual conditions the precise information on the submerged area water depth and exact location of flooding points can be obtained in detail the coupled model used in this study therefore has satisfactory applicability 3 it is necessary to consider the impacts of the rainfall pattern on road vulnerability assessment rainfall with a unimodal shape was found to have the greatest impact on road network vulnerability while that with a uniform shape was found to have the least impact among the unimodal shapes modes ii and iii are the most dangerous for the road network

3956,waterlogging events in urban areas are becoming increasingly more frequent which has led to tremendous economic losses urban road networks have also suffered heavy interference and destruction due to this type of disaster and the precise assessment of road network vulnerability is an effective measure by which to reduce losses therefore in this study an analytical framework for the assessment of the vulnerability of road networks to urban waterlogging was constructed by using a coupled hydrodynamic model the rainfall patterns in the study area were detected and their impacts on vulnerability are discussed the results show that rainfall events with unimodal bimodal and uniform shape patterns respectively account for 68 08 31 46 and 0 47 of the total number of events considered in this study the coupled hydrodynamic model used in this study is found to have satisfactory applicability for waterlogging simulation rainfall with a unimodal shape is found to have the greatest impact on the vulnerability of road networks while that with a uniform shape has the least among the unimodal shapes mode ii late peak and mode iii middle peak are the most dangerous keywords road network vulnerability rainfall pattern coupled model swmm lisflood fp 1 introduction urban waterlogging induced by rainstorms is one of the most frequent dangerous and destructive disasters worldwide adikari and yoshitani 2009 jongman et al 2012 koks 2018 lai et al 2020 jian et al 2021 these disasters result not only in serious direct property losses e g buildings public infrastructure etc but also in inestimable and increasing indirect losses e g the interruption of public services and economic activities etc in urban areas where property and human activities are highly concentrated mejía and moglen 2010 wang et al 2015 lai et al 2016 li et al 2020a unfortunately the intensity of waterlogging in urban areas has been aggravated in recent decades due to increasingly extreme rainstorms the continuously extending impermeable surface and shortages of drainage system capacity moniruzzaman 2012 mahmood et al 2017 singh et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 all of which introduce great challenges to human society urban road networks have suffered heavy interference and destruction due to the increasing number and severity of waterlogging events barredo 2009 kalantari et al 2019 li et al 2020b waterlogging can easily cause roads to become impassable if the submerged depth is high enough the decreased visibility on rainy days and the reduction of friction between tires and the submerged ground affect vehicle stability and safety and are also the intrinsic reasons for the decline of the performance of urban road networks martinez gomariz et al 2018 bocanegra et al 2020 the traffic congestion caused by urban waterlogging then results in extensive knock on effects like the loss of travel time and increases in travel distances traffic delays traffic costs and other losses to different degrees suarez et al 2005 sabir et al 2008 su et al 2016 pregnolato et al 2017a the assessment of the vulnerability of road networks is an effective means for decreasing the losses induced by waterlogging many measures can be adopted if it can be determined which sections are prone to submersion and which roads have high vulnerability chen et al 2021 galli et al 2021 for example road departments could upgrade and renovate roads with targeted guidelines transport agencies could provide early warning and disperse traffic before rainstorms drivers could choose a more appropriate route or cancel their trips etc the accurate assessment of the impact of urban waterlogging on road network vulnerability is an arduous task this topic reflects the intersection of hydrometeorology and transport disciplines and has attracted the attention of numerous scholars and researchers in recent years for instance there are three main approaches by which to assess the impact of extreme weather on road traffic performance namely observational modeling and experimental studies pregnolato et al 2017a a distributed hydrometeorological forecasting method that uses a simple rainfall runoff model was proposed to determine the vulnerability of roads to floods on a regional scale naulin et al 2013 the development and application of two dimensional hydrodynamic models e g mike21 floodmap lisflood fp etc can further improve the simulation accuracy anees et al 2016 as a result many studies have employed these models to simulate the flow and evolution of waterlogging and discuss its impacts on road networks for example the floodmap was used to evaluate the response time and accessibility index of emergency response agencies to urban emergency areas caused by the failure of road nodes triggered by a flood event coles et al 2017 the city catchment analysis tool citycat a two dimensional hydrodynamic model developed to simulate pluvial inundation at high resolution was applied to urban flood simulation based on which they created hazard maps pregnolato et al 2017b the infoworks flood model was used to simulate the flood depth and then the depth can be regarded as the input condition of a traffic model pyatkova et al 2019 with the further development of research the rainfall return period and rainfall scenarios have been gradually added to assessment frameworks for example the floodmap and flood depth related measurements were used to comprehensively assess the potential impacts and risks of road networks under the impact of five heavy rainfall recurrence periods yin et al 2016 a road network velocity assessment framework was developed to determine vulnerability under two different rainfall scenarios singh et al 2018 further the network vulnerability index nvi was used to assess the vulnerability of the transport system in york england which takes into account the availability and importance of each road connection in the network balijepalli and oppong 2014 the relationship between flood depth and vehicle speed was used to quantify and predict the impact of flood events on emergency services tsang and scott 2020 generally these works greatly enhanced the perception of road network vulnerability and provided application references for disaster reduction hydrodynamic models not only can effectively detect waterlogging locations and estimate flooded areas as well as the inundated depth but can also reflect the hydrological process in urban areas which can reveal exact flooding information for the analysis of road networks numerical simulations that use these hydrodynamic models are also less expensive relative to other approaches e g experimental studies thereby increasing their popularity however most previous studies only utilized a single hydrodynamic model to simulate waterlogging or flooding coles et al 2017 pregnolato et al 2017b pyatkova et al 2019 while the flow in the pipe network has usually been ignored underground rainwater pipe networks play an important role in draining waterlogging and the simulation results may be unreasonable if these networks are not considered for example the inundated area and depth of water may be overestimated if only using a hydrodynamic model for that the water should be in rainwater pipe networks while is counted to aboveground water therefore simulations may be more accurate if a hydrodynamic model is coupled with a model that considers underground rainwater pipe networks paz et al 2016 additionally although the rainfall return period and rainfall scenario of a rainstorm have been considered yin et al 2016 singh et al 2018 the impacts of the rainfall pattern on the assessment have rarely been discussed the rainfall pattern could be used to measure the temporal variation of rainfall intensity and the hydrologic process in urban areas may be different if the rainfall patterns are diverse even if the rainfall return period and rainfall scenario are the same additionally many rainfall patterns have been developed while whether these patterns are in compliance with local situation when designing the rainstorm process remains being questioned therefore taking the chebei watershed in guangzhou city china as a case study the objectives of the present research are 1 to construct a coupled hydrodynamic model that combines the storm water management model and lisflood fp to precisely simulate urban waterlogging 2 to assess the vulnerability of road networks based on the waterlogging information exported by the coupled model and 3 to propose a rainstorm process design method considering local rainfall patterns and discuss the impacts of the rainfall pattern on the vulnerability assessment this study is expected to provide a reference for traffic management flood risk management and the prevention and reduction of natural disasters in the study area and beyond 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the chebei watershed which is located in guangzhou city china and has an area of approximately 100 km2 fig 1 was selected to conduct the assessment on road network vulnerability in the present work the watershed features a subtropical maritime monsoon climate mean annual temperatures of 20 22 c and a mean annual precipitation of 1720 mm the watershed is generally low lying with highly urbanized areas and dense buildings the rainwater piping system is of a relatively low standard and can only receive rainfall floods with a return period of lower than 5 years therefore due to its high rainfall impervious surfaces that constitute 70 of the area low lying terrain and low standards of the rainwater piping system the watershed is usually vulnerable to waterlogging hallegatte et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 for example this watershed experienced a heavy rainstorm on may 22 2020 which resulted in the waterlogging of nearly the whole watershed the maximum inundation depth exceeded 1 m at several highway sections and the waterlogging even flowed backward to the subway station the road network in the chebei watershed is very developed see fig 1 however most of the main roads are distributed in low lying areas making them vulnerable to waterlogging which usually results in road network paralysis the frequent occurrence of waterlogging in this area already poses a great threat to the security of the road network so it is extremely urgent to assess its vulnerability and propose targeted improvement measures 2 2 data sources and preprocessing a digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 8 m derived from the guangzhou land resources and planning commission was used to construct the coupled hydrodynamic model the contours of buildings and structures were sketched and included the dem as the final digital ground model other data sources included land use data from the national geographic center of china pipe network data from the guangzhou water affairs bureau remote sensing imagery from google maps and precipitation data from the guangzhou meteorological bureau an original global information system gis based road network dataset used in this study was sourced from openstreetmap osm https www openstreetmap org which is a free open source editable mapping service created by steve coast and developed by the public and can provide a wealth of map element information considering that it is difficult to obtain the actual speed limits of 3000 road networks in the study area we adopted the design speed to conduct the analysis the general information of the road network as well as information like the road grade and importance tags can be completed according to the following url https wiki openstreetmap org wiki zh hans map features based on this road information the design speed of each road was ultimately determined with reference to the design of urban road engineering an industry standard report published by the ministry of housing and urban rural development of china to fully evaluate the impact of rainstorms on the speed of the road network a speed of 15 km h was designed for small roads with a vehicle capacity of less than 20 km h the design speed of the road network in the study area is also shown in fig 1 3 methodology 3 1 rainstorm design 3 1 1 calculation of the amount of rainfall rainfall is a driving factor of urban waterlogging disasters and it is critical to design a reasonable rainstorm process before waterlogging simulation is carried out the frequency duration and intensity of rainfall determine the destructivity and severity of urban floods wang et al 2017 singh et al 2018 in this study the return period was used to measure the rainfall frequency based on which the amount of rainfall was investigated guangzhou has developed its own design formula of rainstorms to describe the local precipitation characteristics as summarized based on the statistical results of historical rainfall events in guangzhou this formula is given as follows 1 q 3618 427 1 0 438 l g p t 11 259 0 750 where q is the rainfall intensity l s hm 2 p is the return period of rainfall a and t is the duration of rainfall min this formula takes into account a variety of recurrence conditions for rainstorm events of different sizes the technical guidelines for establishment of intensity duration frequency curve and design rainstorm profile jointly issued by the ministry of housing and urban rural development and china meteorological administration in 2014 recommend six durations when determining rainfall pattern i e 30 min 60 min 90 min 120 min 150 min and 180 min after referring to relative researches wu et al 2017 2018 chen et al 2018 yang et al 2021 and considering the amount of rainfall the land surface conditions and the pipe network conditions in the study area the duration of rainfall in this work was set to 120 min the amount of rainfall within 120 min with different return periods was ultimately determined as reported in table 1 3 1 2 rainfall pattern recognition the characteristics of rainfall distribution are closely related to the local conditions of hydrology climate topography and geomorphology therefore the rainfall characteristic may vary considerably in different regions making it challengeable to recognize rainfall pattern there is broad agreement that the determination of rainfall pattern should follow the two principles a the designed rainfall pattern should be representative and coincide with the local situation b it should be simple and convenient to use on this basis many widely used rainfall patterns have been developed keifer and chu 1957 huff 1967 pilgrim and cordery 1975 yen and chow 1980 according to the temporal distributions and peak locations of rainfall molokov and shtigorin 1956 analyzed more than 800 rainfall events and proposed seven rainfall patterns for the first time the seven types of rainfall patterns are shown in fig 2 among which modes i ii and iii are unimodal with early late and middle peaks respectively mode iv is uniform and modes v vi and vii are bimodal it has been widely confirmed that these seven modes can cover all rainfall patterns for short duration rainstorm molokov and shtigorin 1956 the fuzzy recognition method is the most common method used to categorize actual rainfall distributions as one of the seven rainfall patterns chen et al 2015 it provides an important way to solve the non deterministic and fuzziness problem in rainfall pattern recognition the steps for determining the rainfall pattern are as follows firstly the percentage of the rainfall in each time period is calculated by dividing the duration of each rainfall then the fuzzy matrix of the seven rainfall patterns are set up according to the proportion of rainfall in each time period shown in fig 2 finally the proximity degree of each historical rainfall is calculated and each historical rainfall pattern is determined the duration of each selected historical rainfall event is standardized and divided into 10 equal time periods and then the ratio of rainfall to total rainfall in period i is 2 x i h i h z i 1 2 10 where h i is the amount of rainfall in time period i h z is the total rainfall and m is the number of time periods each historical rainfall event has a set of x i for each time period and is expressed as a vector as follows 3 x x 1 x 2 x 10 similarly the fuzzy matrices of the seven typical patterns are represented by the following indicator 4 v k v k 1 v k 2 v k 10 k 1 2 7 the meanings of v ki and x i are similar therefore the closeness of each historical rainfall event can be calculated as 5 σ k 1 1 10 i 1 10 v ki x i 2 k 1 2 7 according to the principle of proximity if the degree of proximity σ k is the highest the vector x is closer to v k and then the rainfall belongs to mode k generally the fuzzy recognition method can recognize the optimal rainfall pattern from the seven typical rainfall patterns for each duration rainfall event 3 1 3 rainstorm process design all the historical rainfall events can be recognized into seven modes of rainfall pattern by the fuzzy recognition method the standardized curves of rainfall process of each rainfall event with 10 periods can be acquired according to eq 3 and these curves can be divided into seven classes according their rainfall pattern based on this we proposed a new method for rainstorm process design considering local rainfall patterns an example of mode i was demonstrated to show how to design the rainstorm process of 120 min with 20 y return period as shown in fig 3 a dozens of standardized curves of mode i with 10 periods were clustered in the same coordinate system then a new standardized curve can be achieved by taking the average of all these curves fig 3b obviously this curve can be regarded as a typical curve of mode i in the study area further we extended this typical curve to 120 min by the spline interpolation fig 3c the amount of rainfall with 20 y return period was distributed based on the extended curve and then the curve of rainstorm process of mode i under 20a return period was finally designed fig 3d curves of other modes under different return periods can be finished by following the same steps 3 2 hydrodynamic model 3 2 1 the swmm and lisflood fp model funded by the united states environmental protection agency epa the storm water management model swmm was initially proposed in 1971 and the current swmm 5 1 outperforms previous versions in terms of hydrology hydrodynamics and water quality simulations rossman 2010 it is capable of simulating runoff quantity and quality in primarily urban areas according to the 1d saint venant equations shahed behrouz et al 2020 the swmm model specializes in simulating the hydrodynamics in rainwater piping systems 1d and this function was used to conduct the numerical simulation of rainwater in the pipe network in the present study benefiting from its open source management secondary development can be conducted in this model therefore this function was also employed to couple the swmm with the lisflood fp model lisflood fp is a raster based hydraulic model first developed by bates and de roo 2000 the model can simultaneously simulate 1d river and 2d overland hydrodynamics using the 1d saint venant and 2d shallow water equations respectively it can reflect the flooding process and result in good prediction of the maximum extent of flooding horritt and bates 2002 sosa et al 2020 the main advantage of lisflood fp is that it can be integrated with the high resolution dems that have recently become increasingly available for floodplain areas it is recognized as a simpler model in comparison to most other 2d models bates and de roo 2000 3 2 2 model coupling and verification to overcome the inability of the 2d model to simulate the dynamic processes in rainwater piping systems i e the rainwater pipe network and urban canal the fusion of the 1d and 2d models was conducted to simulate the rainfall runoff flood process in the urban study area in particular the swmm and lisflood fp model were coupled for the urban waterlogging simulations by using the c platform the one way coupled technique i e the rainwater could spill into ground surface from the manhole but not the reverse was applied in this study the hydrological rainfall runoff process and flow routing in rainwater pipe were simulated by the swmm while surcharged flows that spill onto the ground surface from manholes were routed on the 2d domain via the lisflood fp model wu et al 2017 2018 the models were linked by exchanging information at the connecting nodes manholes a timing synchronization technique was adopted to enable the models to exchange discharge information simultaneously the interacting discharge at each manhole was determined by either using the weir or orifice equations depending on the hydraulic heads at the manhole and the aboveground water surface the coupling steps in the c platform are as follows a extract the overflow information from the swmm result out file and form a bdy file b write the overflow point coordinate files bci and dem file asc c write a two dimensional run file par containing simulation duration time step wet dry boundaries slope threshold of flowing water surface default parameters etc d run the two models and output the results the coupling flow chart is shown in fig s1 in the supplementary document more details of the model coupling can be found in previous publications chen et al 2005 2007 leandro et al 2009 seyoum et al 2012 leandro and martins 2016 wu et al 2017 2018 model validation is requisite after model construction russo et al 2015 thus indirect validation was conducted based on evidence based reports the rainstorm that occurred in the study area on may 6 2017 was selected to verify the model chen et al 2020 the maximum rainfall in 1 h reached 78 8 mm and the total rainfall was 164 1 mm most portions of the study area were flooded after this rainstorm indirect validation was conducted because of unavailability of measured data on flow and water level yin et al 2016 wu et al 2017 2018 chen et al 2018 three sections see fig 4 a two of which were located at the lower reaches of the tributary and the other of which was located at the outlet of the main tributary were selected to analyze the flow fig 4 b reveals that the flow peaks of sections 2 and 3 occurred in the fourth hour while that of section 1 occurred in the fifth hour the flow peak was delayed by 1 h relative to those of sections 2 and 3 which is in accordance with the law of flow in urban river dai et al 2020 shahed behrouz et al 2020 further the waterlogging induced by this rainstorm was simulated using the coupled model fig 4 c indicates that approximately 81 of the historical waterlogging points released by the guangzhou water affairs bureau were exactly located in the inundated area accordingly the coupled model constructed for the study area can be regarded as reliable and reasonable and was therefore applied in the subsequent step 3 3 road vulnerability assessment 3 3 1 threshold determination the uncertainty of the waterlogging depth increases the danger of driving vehicles and the stability and controllability of vehicles in waterlogged areas have been popular discussion topics a critical threshold has been proposed to describe the relationship between the submergence depth and road disruption smith et al 2017 experimentally tested the traction force of full size vehicles in still water at different depths and the results showed that the traction force of the vehicles decreased rapidly with the increase of the water depth based on experimental and analytical data shah et al 2021 developed safety guidelines for the stability of vehicles driving on submerged roadways based on these guidelines small passengers large passengers and large four wheel drive vehicles cannot travel in water with depths greater than 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 m respectively referring to the air inlet height of motor vehicles the critical threshold of the water depth of 30 cm on urban roads has been proposed in many studies yin et al 2016 pregnolato et al 2017a pyatkova et al 2019 therefore in this study the depth of 0 3 m was set as the critical threshold for road disruption 3 3 2 vulnerability ranking road traffic is at a standstill when the depth of waterlogging surpasses the critical threshold however even if the waterlogging depth is below the critical threshold and the road is passable to vehicles the driving speed is bound to be restricted by the waterlogging depth the safety speed of the road network can be updated after the waterlogging depth is determined and different depth levels have corresponding road safety speeds via the use of radar velocimetry the waterlogging depth and driving speed were investigated at six locations in beijing china with serious waterlogging based on the statistical findings du and yang 2011 proposed the hyperbolic tangent function to express the speed attenuation model 6 v v 0 2 tanh w a b v 0 2 where v is the running speed v 0 is the design speed which has different values for different types of road a is the median of the critical depth of water that causes the vehicle to stop and b is the elastic attenuation coefficient that reflects the attenuation rate of speed with the increase of the water depth the value of which is generally between 3 and 5 the smaller the value the faster the speed attenuation the graphical representation of the speed attenuation model is exhibited in fig 5 the r 2 value of the hyperbolic tangent model applied to beijing was 0 86 du and yang 2011 suggesting relatively high model accuracy therefore this speed attenuation model was directly used in the present study due to the similarity between the traffic rules and road materials used in guangzhou and beijing the waterlogging depth of the road network was extracted from the distribution map simulated by the coupled model under 42 rainstorms under six return periods and all seven rainfall types were used in simulations the attenuation model was then used to calculate the safety speed of the road network for the corresponding water depth the safety speed will be less than the design speed under normal weather conditions so a distance matrix was employed to create interaction weights for the vulnerability ranking on a scale of 0 9 according to the study of singh et al 2018 the safety speed under the condition of waterlogging was divided into 10 intervals in order and arranged horizontally then each road level was arranged vertically in increasing order according to the design speed a 10 10 distance matrix of vulnerability rankings was ultimately formed as shown in table 2 weights were assigned to each class according to the change in speed from the normal sequential range of 0 a small change in speed to 9 a reduction in the design speed to 0 i e from 80 km h to 0 the higher the level of the road network the higher the design speed the greater the decrease in the safety speed and the higher the vulnerability ranking for example a design speed of 30 km h would result in a maximum vulnerability ranking of 4 and a design speed of 80 km h would result in a vulnerability ranking of 9 4 results 4 1 rainfall pattern and design rainstorm in this study a total of 213 rainstorm events during 1954 2012 were screened out from the rainfall data provided by the rain measuring station near the study area wushan station for inclusion in the study the interval between two events needed to be more than 120 min and the amount of rainfall of each event needed to be greater than 50 mm as the rainfall durations of these events were different the durations were uniformly divided into 10 intervals for convenient calculation the fuzzy recognition method was used to recognize the rainfall pattern among the 213 events the numbers of rainfall patterns of modes i vii were respectively 81 17 47 1 7 57 and 3 the number of rainstorms with a unimodal shape modes i ii and iii was 145 accounting for 68 08 moreover there were 67 events with a bimodal shape accounting for 31 46 finally only one event had a uniform shape accounting for 0 47 these proportions of rainfall pattern modes are similar to those reported in the study of chen et al 2015 it is evident that rainstorms with a unimodal shape were dominant in the study area while the uniform shape mode iv was sparse the 120 min rainfall processes of 42 scenarios see fig 6 were designed according to the steps in section 3 1 3 and the amount of rainfall reported in table 1 a straight line was used to reflect the rainfall process of mode iv because there was only one sample and it was therefore unrepresentative for this study generally these rainstorm series consider the actual rainfall features and can then be imported for the coupled model in the subsequent step 4 2 maximum depth and inundated area waterlogging simulations were conducted under 42 scenarios and the maximum waterlogging depth as well as the inundated area were extracted by the arcgis platform taking mode iii as an example see fig 7 the uneven distributions of the topography and land use resulted in the unevenness of the spatial distribution of waterlogging especially in the highly urbanized residential and commercial areas where the impact of waterlogging is greater than in other areas although the maximum depth and inundated area increased with the increase of the return period there was a high degree of consistency among the spatial distributions which presented visual similarities under the six different return periods the results based on the other six rainfall patterns see fig s2 in the supplementary document were basically similar generally there were also significant increases in the maximum depth and inundated area when the return period was greater than 5 y meaning that the standards for waterlogging control are quite low and the study area will face a severe threat if no targeted measures are adopted the proportions of inundated areas under the 42 scenarios were determined see fig 8 and table s1 in the supplementary document and it was found that the proportions increased greatly with the increase of the return period the proportions of inundated areas with different rainfall patterns were also different although under the same return period suggesting that the rainfall pattern can impact the waterlogging conditions additionally the maximum inundated areas based on the unimodal shape were larger than those based on the bimodal and uniform shapes among the seven rainfall patterns the inundated area of mode iii was found to be the largest while that of mode iv was found to be the smallest which is consistent with the study of chen et al 2018 moreover the largest difference 2 21 between modes iii and v was found under the 20 y return period generally different rainfall patterns can induce various inundated areas despite a relatively small difference within the same return period however these differences cannot be ignored because they may cause huge losses especially in highly urbanized areas where property and population are highly centralized 4 3 statistics of reduction in speed based on the speed attenuation model the safety speed distribution of the 42 scenarios was analyzed the accumulated and average road lengths in each safety speed interval under different rainfall scenarios as well as under the normal condition no waterlogging were also explored see fig 9 it was found that the road network speed was redistributed due to the waterlogging of the road surface moreover the road length of each speed interval was quite different under the conditions of rainstorms with different return periods and rainfall patterns according to fig 9 for all seven rainfall patterns the average road length for each speed interval was longer under the condition of a lower return period the total road length affected by waterlogging was found to increase greatly with the increase of the return period to compare the effects of different rainfall patterns some speed intervals that the road length is reduced compared to normal weather conditions were chosen to compare the magnitude of road lengths after the road network speed redistribution under each rainfall patterns the speed intervals including 10 15 15 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 and 70 80 were ranked in order from first grade 1 to seventh grade 7 according to the road length the average grade of the selected speed interval in each return period was respectively counted table 3 the results demonstrate that mode ii had the highest average road length grade 5 79 followed by mode iii and mode i respectively while mode iv only had a grade of 1 31 therefore it can be concluded that mode ii has the greatest impact on reducing the safety speed of a road network among the seven rainfall patterns while mode iv has the least influence fig 10 presents the proportions of road length variation in different speed intervals after the redistribution of the road speed as compared with normal conditions the rainfall scenarios with different return periods and rainfall patterns were found to vary greatly in terms of the length of roads as compared to the normal conditions in terms of rainfall patterns similar methods were adopted to compare the proportion of road length reduction under each rainfall pattern the order of the seven rainfall patterns was also similar to the previous conclusion i e the order in which the degree of effects decrease from high to low was found to be mode ii iii i vi vii v and iv the increase of the return period caused the increase of the proportion of the road length especially when the speed interval was 0 this indicates that the increase of the return period caused the proportion of road network interruption to increase sharply from 9 1 y to 40 100 y 4 4 road network vulnerability ranking the spatial distribution of the road network vulnerability rankings and the sum of the corresponding road lengths under the 42 rainfall scenarios were calculated fig 11 presents the spatial distribution of the road network vulnerability ranking under mode iii with the maximum waterlogging depths of different return periods it is evident that the number of roads with high vulnerability increased as the return period increased in addition the spatial distribution of the vulnerability ranking was found to be highly consistent with that of the maximum inundated depth fig 7 other rainfall patterns also present similar distributions see fig s3 in the supplementary document however for the same return period taking 5 y return period as an example fig 12 the spatial distributions of the vulnerability rankings are nearly the same suggesting that the spatial differences induced by various rainfall patterns are insignificant to observe the subtle changes in the vulnerability rankings of the rainfall patterns under different return periods fig 13 and table s2 supplementary document present the total and average lengths of each vulnerability ranking under the 42 rainfall scenarios with the increase of return period the average length with vulnerability ranked 9 surged from 12 51 km to 50 6 km and that ranked 0 dropped from 621 82 km to 414 11 km some decreased and some increased for other lengths with vulnerability ranked 1 to 8 considering that the road networks at high vulnerability ranking are more dangerous than those at lower ranking we adopted a weighted average grade it is worth noting that this weighted average is different from the simple average appearing in table 3 a weighting factor λ was introduced for each road network vulnerability ranking 7 λ i i i 1 9 i i 1 2 9 where λ i is the weighting coefficient when road network vulnerability ranking is i similarly the weighted grades of the road lengths of different rainfall patterns under each vulnerability level were compared excluding the unaffected road vulnerability level of 0 and the average grades of the six return periods were calculated as reported in table 4 the results show that mode iii is the most dangerous rainfall pattern with the lowest grade 2 73 while mode v is the least dangerous rainfall pattern with the highest grade 5 35 finally the average lengths and standard deviations of the vulnerability rankings of the seven rainfall patterns under each return period were calculated as illustrated in fig 14 fig 14 a reveals that the average road lengths of the seven rainfall patterns under various vulnerability rankings generally increased with the increase of the return period for example the average length of roads with a vulnerability rank of 3 increased from 26 28 km 3 6 to 72 98 km 9 9 with the increase of the return period from 1 y to 100 y fig 14 b shows that the standard deviations of the lengths of the seven rainfall patterns slightly increased with the increase of the return period which also indicates that the increase of the return period has no significant effect on the differences among the vulnerability rankings of the seven rainfall patterns in conclusion in terms of the rainfall pattern the unimodal shape has the greatest impact on road network vulnerability followed by the bimodal shape and the uniform shape has the least impact however relative to the rainfall pattern the return period plays a more important role in impacting the vulnerability of the road network 5 discussion the assessment of the vulnerability of road networks is an effective means for reducing road traffic injuries and property damage many improved and remedial measures can be adopted if the vulnerability of road networks is clarified in advance which could greatly decrease the consequential losses due to waterlogging it is an inevitable general trend to conduct accurate and elaborate assessments as the demands for driving safety and property conservation become increasingly higher therefore the information on the submerged conditions and evolution process of waterlogging should be as detailed as possible however most previous studies only used a single hydrodynamic model to simulate surface waterlogging or flooding and usually ignored the flow in the pipe network coles et al 2017 pregnolato et al 2017b pyatkova et al 2019 while these simulations may meet the requirements from a macroscale perspective they are usually not detailed enough for the implementation of improvement measures therefore in this study a coupled model was used to improve this problem the mechanisms of runoff production and flow confluence in an urban area were embedded in the coupled model and the hydrological processes including runoff production flow confluence the rising stage evolution fluctuation and recession were simulated the water both on the surface and in the pipe network is considered in the model which matches well with the actual situation via this coupled model the submerged area the waterlogging depth and the exact location of flooding points can be displayed in detail after which targeted solutions as mentioned in the introduction section can be taken to reduce losses an analytical framework for road vulnerability assessment based on the submerged conditions from the coupled model was also constructed this framework can yield which exact roads are prone to waterlogging as well as the degree of the effect which has important reference value for transport agencies and drivers in the assessment the relationship between the running speed of the vehicle and the water depth of the study area was unclear due to a lack of measured data therefore a speed attenuation model was used to analyze the vehicle running speed this model has been proven to have an ideal effect when applied to beijing and its r 2 value reached as high as 0 86 du and yang 2011 china has released uniform national regulations on traffic guidance and road construction which guarantees uniform standards in other words the traffic rules of guangzhou and beijing are almost the same which indirectly suggests the rationality of the use of the speed attenuation model in the study area in the present work similarly the speed attenuation model can also be expanded to other cities the results also demonstrated that rainfall events with different patterns could lead to relatively large differences in road vulnerability even under the same return period generally rainfall with a unimodal shape has the greatest impact on the road network vulnerability while that with a uniform shape has the least impact among the unimodal shapes mode ii late peak and mode iii middle peak are the most dangerous for the road network as techniques of precipitation nowcasting are becoming increasingly mature it is becoming easier to learn the pattern of a rainfall event two to three hours in advance in this case waterlogging conditions can be predicted and road vulnerability can be pre estimated via the implementation of the coupled model which could provide timely references for traffic management and trip guidance corresponding measures can then be taken during the buffer time and losses could undoubtedly be reduced 6 conclusions the accurate assessment of the impact of urban waterlogging on road network vulnerability is of significance for traffic management flood risk management and the prevention and reduction of natural disasters in the study area and beyond in this study the patterns of rainfall events in the chebei watershed during 1954 2012 were first recognized by the fuzzy recognition method then a coupled hydrodynamic model that combines the storm water management model and lisflood fp was constructed to simulate urban waterlogging finally the vulnerability of the road network was assessed and the impacts of the rainfall pattern were discussed the conclusions of this research can be summarized as follows 1 a total of 213 rainstorm events during 1954 2012 were screened out from the available rainfall data the events with a unimodal shape pattern accounted for 68 08 those with a bimodal shape accounted for 31 46 and those with a uniform shape accounted only for 0 47 2 the coupled hydrodynamic model can consider overland flow 2d pipe flow 1d and their interaction which better reflects the actual conditions the precise information on the submerged area water depth and exact location of flooding points can be obtained in detail the coupled model used in this study therefore has satisfactory applicability 3 it is necessary to consider the impacts of the rainfall pattern on road vulnerability assessment rainfall with a unimodal shape was found to have the greatest impact on road network vulnerability while that with a uniform shape was found to have the least impact among the unimodal shapes modes ii and iii are the most dangerous for the road network

3957,river discharge is one of the key elements in the global water cycle however its observation and projection are still lacking in alpine regions this study analyzed the annual and seasonal variability of the river discharge in the upper region of the yarlung zangbo river basin investigated the climate discharge relationship and projected the annual trend in the next few decades 2021 2100 based on a distributed hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat results show that river discharge did not show the same trend as precipitation at either annual or seasonal scale in the study area it indicated that precipitation might not be the primary source of river discharge and meltwater from snow glacier and frozen soil could account for a large percentage of river discharge the projected river discharge would vary significantly among years with different changing rates under different climate change scenarios overall this study contributes to investigate the unusual climate discharge relationship which is different from that in the whole river basin moreover to separately consider the parameters related to snow melt could significantly improve the simulation accuracy however it could be further improved by considering the freeze and thaw processes of soil and glacier which are not included in the swat model keywords river discharge swat snow melt hydrological model yarlung zangbo river basin 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp is located in the western part of china with a total area of 2 5 million km2 as the total water resources of this region reaches 640 km3 it is well known as asia s water tower huang et al 2018 liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b there are densely distributed rivers lakes wetlands snow mountains and glaciers within this region specifically it is the headwaters region of several large rivers e g the yangtze river the yellow river the mekong lancang river the nu river the yarlung zangbo river the ganges river and the indus river in the world liu and shi 2019 for example water from the tp accounts for 25 49 and 15 of the annual river discharge of the yangtze river the yellow river and the mekong lancang river respectively in the whole tp the upper region of yarlung zangbo river basin yzrb is regarded as the vital headwater region for the water resources of china india bhutan and bangladesh this region is seldomly influenced by human activities and thus it can be regarded as the important study area for exploring the river discharge mechanisms under the influence of climate change li 2012 liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b however due to the quite high elevation i e with an average elevation of over 4000 m and complex topography this region is usually poorly gauged and it is difficult to obtain the raw hydrometeorological data even though such data are more valuable than those in the mid and down stream regions for exploring the river discharge mechanisms river discharge as the water resources directly to be used is an important factor in the water cycle the water in the yzrb can mainly be recharged from precipitation snow meltwater and glacial meltwater ban et al 2021 the meteorological elements in the yzrb can be more significantly influenced by global climate change than other regions around the world ipcc 2013 kuang and jiao 2016 xi et al 2018 ma et al 2020 which may probably affect the hydrological processes previous studies have reported increasing trends in precipitation cao and pan 2014 shi et al 2016a but decreasing trends in evaporation chen et al 2006 zhang et al 2007 over the tp in particular for the yzrb yao et al 2012 pointed out that the precipitable water vapor across this region could largely affect the energy and hydrological processes liu et al 2019a and liu et al 2019b found different trends in soil moisture changes in the upper i e a decreasing trend and lower i e an increasing trend areas during 2006 2020 using the vic variable infiltration capacity model liang et al 1994 driven by the observed meteorological data meanwhile potential evapotranspiration showed a decreasing trend over the whole yzrb during 1957 2015 ma et al 2018 in addition highly different distributions of snow cover and snow melt have been found in different seasons in the yzrb for the areas with seasonal snow cover and snow melt climate change could influence the surface runoff and further the river discharge through the changing snow cover area barnett et al 2005 most part of the upper region of the yzrb is covered by snow and some of the snow coverage belongs to seasonal snowpack and ban et al 2021 revealed that the snow melt could crucially contribute to the river discharge in the yarlung zangbo river furthermore huang et al 2018 used 1000 high spatial resolution images to obtain the information about the water surface areas and water levels to estimate the river discharge in the yzrb with the aid of the empirical equations this method could significantly improve the river discharge estimation with the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse of 0 98 however limited by a mass of data processing required in this method the time consuming is still a problem to be further addressed which may make this method hardly to be widely followed therefore it is still necessary and important to further investigate the characteristics of the river discharge which can be influenced by both precipitation and snow meltwater this study aims to reveal new findings on the climate discharge relationship in the upper region of the yzrb which are different from those in previous studies based on limited observed data for example the unusual precipitation discharge relationship which is quite different from that in the whole river basin indicates that precipitation may not be the primary source of river discharge instead snow melt which is closely related to temperature can account for a large percentage of river discharge moreover soil and water assessment tool swat was used to simulate the historic river discharge and project the future trend in the following section 2 briefly introduces the study area i e the upper region of the yzrb the research data and the methodologies used in this study section 3 presents the results and discussion including 1 analysis of station observations 2 analysis of model simulations 3 future variation of river discharge 4 discussion and 5 limitations finally section 4 summarizes the major conclusions of this study overall the outcomes of this study can be of great value for better recognizing the characteristics of the river discharge under a changing climate especially for similar source regions with the integrated effects of precipitation and snow melt 2 data and method 2 1 study area the yarlung zangbo river is the longest highland river in china with the length of 2057 km and catchment area of 0 24 million km2 in the southern tp you et al 2007 it originates from the jemajangzong glacier on the northern foothills of the himalaya mountains in southwest tibet and flows through the southern part of tibet fig 1 the mean annual precipitation is 949 mm presenting an increasing trend from the upper region i e 300 mm to the lower region i e 4000 mm liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b moreover nearly 80 of the annual precipitation occurs during the rainy season from july to september sang et al 2016 normally the mean annual potential evapotranspiration is about 1200 mm ma et al 2018 while the mean annual air temperature is about 6 c the maximum monthly mean air temperature occurs in june or july in the lower region and the minimum occurs in january ban et al 2021 in addition the mean annual river discharge of the yarlung zangbo river in the territory of china is 140 km3 yang et al 2014 it is worth noting that snow melt is an important source of river discharge in the upper region while precipitation supplies water for the river discharge in the lower region this study focuses on the region above the lazi station which is an alpine valley zone with a catchment area of 50 432 km2 the elevation of the study area is over 3950 m and the spatial distribution of the slope values is shown in fig 2 2 2 research data there are 10 meteorological stations available in the yzrb fig 1 the daily observed data e g precipitation evaporation air pressure air temperature relative humidity and wind speed from 1951 can be downloaded from the official website of china meteorological administration cma and the monthly seasonal and annual values can be derived from the daily values cma 2016 however there is no station in the region above the lazi station and the stations in the lower region are relatively far away from the study area therefore the analysis of station observations in subsection 3 1 will be based on the observed data recorded at the lazi station considering that the lazi station is also an important control hydrological station in the upper region of the yzrb the daily data recorded at this station from 2001 to 2004 are used to investigate the relationship between river discharge and meteorological variables in the study area in addition since there is no station in the region above the lazi station a grid based dataset i e cmads china meteorological assimilation driving datasets for the swat model is introduced as the supplement for analysis because this dataset has been widely used and proven to have good performances in many regions of china cao et al 2018 meng et al 2019 jiang et al 2020b wang et al 2020 the details for this dataset can be found in the study of meng and wang 2018 for river discharge simulation both the observed meteorological data recorded at all the 10 stations and the grid based dataset i e cmads are used and the relevant results will be compared the soil dataset of china provided by cold and arid region scientific data center is used fig 2 this dataset is produced based on harmonized world soil database hwsd the land use dataset of china provided by resource and environment science and data center is used in this study liu et al 2003 as shown in fig 2 the definitions of different types of soil and land use within the study area are listed in table 1 furthermore the projected meteorological datasets derived from different climate change scenarios under cmip6 coupled model intercomparison project 6 are used to predict the future variation of river discharge during 2021 2100 in the study area the relevant data can be downloaded from https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 the various climate change scenarios are proposed based on five shared socioeconomic pathways ssps which correspond to five narratives describing alternative socio economic developments i e sustainable development ssp1 middle of the road development ssp2 regional rivalry ssp3 inequality ssp4 and fossil fueled development ssp5 riahi et al 2017 the cmip6 has generated a few new scenarios using different combinations of socioeconomic pathways and nominal rcp representative concentration pathway forcing levels i e 2 6 w m2 4 5 w m2 7 0 w m2 and 8 5 w m2 knutti and sedláček 2013 for example ssp1 2 6 indicates the scenario that the radiative forcing level reaches 3 1 w m2 by the mid century but returns to 2 6 w m2 by 2100 under sustainable development the scenario model intercomparison project scenariomip for cmip6 has two tiers i e tier 1 and tier 2 of future climate change scenarios according to the priority o neill et al 2016 in this study four scenarios which belong to tier 1 are selected including ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 moreover according to the study of jiang et al 2020a it is better to use multiple global climate models gcms for analysis however based on the focus of the future prediction part of this study i e to predict the changing trend of river discharge in the study area it is not necessary to detect all the possible ranges of river discharge from multi model simulations therefore only gcm i e bcc csm2 mr is used for future prediction previous studies e g kong and sun 2021 wang et al 2021 have indicated that bcc csm2 mr is one of the most representative gcms for this study area because this dataset has a good consistency with the observation data 2 3 hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat which was developed by the u s department of agriculture usda agricultural research service ars in the 1990s arnold et al 1993 arnold et al 1998 was adopted as a platform to simulate the river discharges at the lazi station swat is a comprehensive surface groundwater flow model which has been widely used to numerous river basins worldwide wu and chen 2012 wu and chen 2013 baker and miller 2013 abbaspour et al 2015 liang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 regarding hydrological response unit hru as the basic simulation unit flügel 1996 swat can well simulate a variety of the land surface hydrological processes as well as plant growth soil erosion sediment and contamination transport and snow melt specifically for the snow melt simulation on a given day the following equation is used to estimate the daily snow melt volume neitsch et al 2009 1 sno w melt f melt s n o w cov t snow t max 2 t melt where snowmelt is the daily snow melt volume mm h2o fmelt is the snow melt factor mm h2o c day snowcov is the percentage of the hrus with snow cover tsnow is the snow pack temperature c tmax is the maximum temperature c and tmelt is the temperature threshold of snow melt c for the study area i e the region above the lazi station totally 448 hrus were set up for river discharge simulation the input meteorological data of the model were generated by using the default module named weather stations in arcswat and the temporal scale of the simulation could be daily monthly and yearly moreover swat is still undergoing continued expansion of its capabilities and there have been several versions of this model i e swat2000 arnold and fohrer 2005 swat2005 neitsch et al 2005 swat2009 neitsch et al 2009 and swat2012 arnold et al 2012a the latest version swat2012 was used for simulation and swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup was used for automatic calibration of the swat model abbaspour et al 2007 2 4 assessment criteria to quantitatively evaluate the performance of river discharge simulation at both annual and seasonal scales the following two objective functions are used as the assessment criteria relative error re and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse for assessment of the total volume of water for the simulation results the objective function re is used the equation to compute this objective function is given as 2 re v sim v obs v obs where v obs is the total volume of water derived from the observed river discharge data at the lazi station and v sim is the total volume of water derived from the simulated river discharge for assessment of the hydrograph for the simulation results the objective function nse is used the equation for nse is given as nash and sutcliffe 1970 3 nse 1 i 1 n q i sim q i obs 2 i 1 n q i obs q obs 2 where qi obs is the observed river discharge value at the lazi station on the i th day qi sim is the simulated river discharge value on the same day n is the number of days and q obs is the mean of the observed river discharge values for all the n days 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of station observations 3 1 1 comparison of grid based data with station observations station observations are normally considered to be relatively accurate and reliable at the location of a meteorological station however in regions with sparse network density grid based data are regarded as a feasible supplement for station observations mishra et al 2011 although grid based data can provide areal estimates the accuracy may not be as high as station observations for a designated point because the estimated value in each grid is the result of the retrieval within a certain range and includes considerable uncertainties shi et al 2020 therefore grid based data need to be corrected by using station observations before further analysis as there is no station in the region above the lazi station this study only compared the meteorological data recorded in the cmads grid where the lazi station locates with the observed meteorological data recorded at the lazi station and the results were used to determine the correction factors precipitation and air temperature were selected as the representative meteorological variables and the study period was consistent with the length of the river discharge data series i e from 2001 to 2004 to clear both the intra and inter annual changing patterns the following analyses were conducted at both annual and seasonal scales in this study spring includes march april and may summer includes june july and august autumn includes september october and november and winter includes december january and february this category for each season stayed the same as that in another previous study ban et al 2021 table 2 presents comparisons of grid based data with station observations for precipitation p and air temperature t at both annual and seasonal scales the systematic biases are obvious the p values from the grid based data i e p g were all higher than those from station observations i e p s while the maximum and minimum t noted as tmax and tmin hereafter values from the grid based data i e tmax g and tmin g were all lower than those from station observations i e tmax s and tmin s to make corrections in the average sense the annual values were adopted to determine the correction factors of precipitation and air temperature for precipitation the p g values were 7 20 20 and 10 higher than the p s values in 2001 2002 2003 and 2004 respectively thus the mean percentage bias was 14 during 2001 2004 for the maximum t the tmax s value was 3 5 c 3 4 c 3 3 c and 3 2 c larger than the tmax g value in 2001 2002 2003 and 2004 respectively thus the mean bias between the tmax g and tmax s values was 3 35 c during 2001 2004 for the minimum t the tmin s value was 2 1 c 2 2 c 2 2 c and 2 3 c larger than the tmin g value in 2001 2002 2003 and 2004 respectively thus the mean bias between the tmin g and tmin s values was 2 2 c during 2001 2004 in the following the mean percentage bias 14 for precipitation the mean bias 3 35 c for the maximum t and the mean bias 2 2 c for the minimum t would be used as the correction factors to correct the basin scale precipitation and air temperature calculated from the cmads dataset 3 1 2 variability of river discharge as a basic hydrometeorological variable precipitation can significantly influence the water cycle as well as the hydrological processes liu and shi 2019 normally river discharge should be closely correlated with precipitation in a given region luo and wang 2013 the basin averaged precipitation over the study area was firstly calculated from the cmads dataset and then corrected by the mean percentage bias 14 the corrected precipitation data p and the river discharge data recorded at the lazi station r at both annual and seasonal scales were used to explore the relationship between precipitation and river discharge over the region above the lazi station table 3 the p and r values were calculated separately for each year and season in this study area the interannual variation of precipitation was less significant than that of river discharge during the study period fig 3 moreover the changing trends of precipitation and river discharge were not consistent with each other which was far away from general relationship that more precipitation could generate more discharge for a given basin for example at the annual scale the minimum p i e 317 mm in 2001 was about 81 of the maximum p i e 392 mm in 2002 while the minimum r i e 87 6 mm in 2003 was about 85 of the maximum r i e 103 0 mm in 2001 in addition the p values did not show a trend from 2001 to 2004 while the r values showed an overall decreasing trend during the same period however such correlation correlation coefficient r 0 25 was not significant significance level p 0 10 with reference to the results at the seasonal scale the r values were 0 96 0 24 0 99 and 0 22 for spring summer autumn and winter respectively the correlations in spring and autumn were significant p 0 05 but the correlations in summer and winter were not significant p 0 10 previous studies have pointed out that river discharge can be directly associated with precipitation over the whole yzrb liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b but such conclusion was obtained at a relatively larger spatial scale in contrast at a relatively smaller spatial scale especially for the upper region with mass of snow cover the relationship between river discharge and precipitation might be influenced by other factors besides precipitation meltwater from snow glacier and frozen soil can be regarded as the other important sources of river discharge in this specific study area ban et al 2021 these factors can be closely related to air temperature thus their impacts on river discharge should be further investigated through analyzing air temperature for example the correlation coefficient between summer river discharge and spring precipitation i e r 0 52 was higher than that between summer river discharge and summer precipitation i e r 0 24 indicating that spring precipitation could have significant impacts on summer river discharge the reason for this is that due to low air temperature precipitation in spring may be stored in the form of snow and frozen soil instead of directly generating river discharge and then be released into the river as meltwater in summer when air temperature becomes higher in addition table 3 also lists the statistical results of potential evaporation pe at both annual and seasonal scales which were calculated from the observed evaporation data recorded at the lazi station using small pan e20 based on the method in the studies of shi et al 2014 and shi et al 2017 the conversion coefficient from small pan e20 to pe is 0 585 which is the product of the conversion coefficient i e 0 65 from small pan e20 to large pan e 601 and the conversion coefficient i e 0 90 from e 601 to pe comparing with the p s values obtained from the observed data recorded at the lazi station table 2 the pe values were much higher than the p s values over the study area for example at the annual scale the pe values were around five times as high as the p s values although the actual evaporation should be a little bit lower than pe it would still be much higher than precipitation as a result based on the water balance of a region there should be other sources of water e g meltwater from snow glacier and frozen soil to generate the river discharge 3 1 3 impacts of air temperature on river discharge the basin averaged tmax and tmin were firstly calculated from the cmads dataset and then corrected by the mean biases of 3 35 c for tmax and 2 2 c for tmin table 3 lists the statistical results of tmax and tmin at both annual and seasonal scales the interannual variations of tmax and tmin were similar with the differences of 2 2 c i e 7 0 9 2 c for tmax and 1 9 c i e 6 7to 4 8 c for tmin the variations of tmax and tmin in the same season among different years were more remarkable than the interannual variations except for summer for tmax the differences were 4 7 c 5 0 9 7 c in spring 0 5 c 15 8 16 3 c in summer 2 9 c 7 6 10 5 c in autumn and 2 2 c 0 9 1 3 c in winter for tmin the differences were 4 1 c 9 0to 4 9 c in spring 1 3 c 3 6 4 9 c in summer 2 6 c 6 1 to 3 5 c in autumn and 2 5 c 15 5 to 13 0 c in winter the air temperature difference of tmax was a little bit larger than that of tmin in spring and autumn while the air temperature difference of tmax was smaller than that of tmin in summer and winter to investigate the impacts of air temperature on river discharge in different seasons the relationships of river discharge with air temperature at the seasonal scale were further analyzed fig 4 shows that the scatters could be well fitted by linear regression and the coefficients of determination r 2 were both high i e 0 81 for tmax and 0 83 for tmin it indicated that the maximum and minimum air temperatures both had overall positive correlations with river discharge namely higher air temperatures could generally lead to larger river discharges moreover the minimum air temperature had a closer relationship with river discharge than the maximum air temperature as a result it is concluded that air temperature is an essential factor that must be considered when discussing the characteristics of river discharge in this study area ban et al 2021 3 2 analysis of model simulations 3 2 1 simulation results at the annual scale the overall performance of the simulated river discharges at the lazi station during the study period 2001 2004 was first evaluated based on the observed meteorological data recorded at stations it is worth noting that as initial conditions were needed for swat the starting year of the simulation was set to be 1998 i e 3 years before 2001 to preheat the model before parameter calibration in this study 20 parameters were automatically calibrated using swat cup and table 4 lists the values of all the calibrated parameters fig 5 shows the comparison of observations and simulations and table 5 lists the values of the selected assessment criteria at the annual scale i e re for the total volume of water and nse for the hydrograph in the oc s overall calibration based on station observations case the best simulation result had the re value of 12 and the nse value of 0 66 which were reasonable values however the simulation results could have continued improvement when looking for a deeper insight into the performance of model simulations in each year it is observed that the re value was quite large i e 35 and the nse value was quite low i e 0 27 in 2003 while the performances in other years were generally acceptable with the re values of 12 6 and the nse values of 0 68 0 77 therefore the swat model was further calibrated separately for each year based on the above analysis of station observations temperature is regarded to be an important influencing factor on snow melt glacier and frozen soil which can further affect river discharge in this area in the swat model the freeze and thaw processes of soil and glacier are not included therefore only the process of snow melt was taken into account in model simulations although ignoring the freeze and thaw processes of soil and glacier would inevitably bring errors to simulation results however such effect would not play a more decisive role in simulating river discharge than that of precipitation and snow melt it is worth noting that precipitation types e g rain snow and sleet can have great impacts on river discharge ding et al 2014 there are five parameters related to snow melt simulation in the swat model i e sftmp snowfall temperature smtmp snow melt base temperature smfmx melt factor for snow on june 21 smfmn melt factor for snow on december 21 and timp snowpack temperature lag factor among them sftmp indicates the mean air temperature at which precipitation can be rain or snow with equal likelihood therefore the precipitation data can be directly used for simulation and will be distinguished as snow or rain by the swat model these five parameters were further calibrated while keeping the other parameters unchanged the details of these parameters can be found in arnold et al 2012b sftmp and smtmp have the same range of 5 5 c smfmx and smfmn have the same range of 1 4 6 9 mm h2o c day and timp has the range of 0 01 1 0 the calibrated parameters for the whole study period as well as each year are listed in table 6 compared to the calibrated parameters for the whole study period only the value of timp was changed in 2001 and 2002 which indicated that the influence of the previous day s snowpack temperature on the current day s snowpack temperature could not be ignored in contrast in 2003 and 2004 the values of the other four parameters were changed which indicated that the threshold values of snowfall and snow melt and the impact of snowpack density on snow melt were the more important factors based on these calibrated parameters the newly simulated river discharges at the lazi station in each year were obtained and the performances of the simulation results are also listed in table 5 in the sc s separate calibration based on station observations case the re values were all within 10 and smaller than those in the oc s case the nse values were all over 0 80 and higher than those in the oc s case in particular the most significant improvement was found in 2003 with the re value of 9 from 35 and the nse value of 0 88 from 0 27 3 2 2 simulation results at the seasonal scale considering the significant variations of river discharge precipitation and air temperature among different seasons performances of the simulation results at the seasonal scale were further evaluated table 7 lists the values of the selected assessment criteria in general significant improvements were found in summer and autumn for the whole study period e g the re values decreased from 12 and 13 in the oc s case to 3 and 10 in the sc s case and the nse values increased from 0 50 and 0 56 in the oc s case to 0 85 and 0 75 in the sc s case moreover the improvement in spring was truly little while the performance in winter in the sc s case was even worse than that in the oc s case with reference to a single year similar results were obtained in most summers and autumns except for autumn in 2004 swat performed better in the sc s case than in the oc s case according to the re values table 7 in springs swat performed better in the sc s case than in the oc s case in two years i e 2001 and 2002 but worse in the other two i e 2003 and 2004 in all winters swat performed worse in the sc s case than in the oc s case therefore it is concluded that swat cannot work well in the situation when river discharge is mainly supplied by snow melt e g winter and spring 3 2 3 comparison of simulation results from grid based data with those from station data simulation results from the cmads dataset were compared with those from the observed data recorded at the lazi station to verify the effectiveness of the cmads dataset in the upper region of the yzrb the river discharges simulated from the cmads dataset in the oc g and sc g cases are shown in fig 5 and the relevant assessment criteria are listed in table 5 it is observed that the simulation results from grid based data had better performance than those from station data especially in baseflow simulation in the oc g case the best simulation result had the re value of 3 and the nse value of 0 76 which was better than the best simulation result from the observed meteorological data recorded at stations i e re 12 and nse 0 66 the differences between the model performances in these four years were less significant especially for the nse values ranging from 0 72 to 0 80 for the year 2003 which could not be well simulated using the station observations the re value was 0 and the nse value was 0 73 indicating that the cmads dataset could have better performance in river discharge simulation in this area although the overall performances of the cmads dataset were better than those of station observations there were still exceptions for example the re values were 16 6 in 2002 and 22 larger than 12 in 2004 and the nse value in 2002 was 0 72 lower than 0 77 in subsection 3 2 1 it is found that for the observed meteorological data recorded at stations to separately calibrate the parameters related to snow melt could significantly improve the simulation accuracy separate calibration was also conducted in each year for the cmads dataset in the sc g case the re values were all within 4 and smaller than those in the oc g case the nse values were all over 0 75 and higher than those in the oc g case table 5 however the improvements were not as significant as those for the observed meteorological data recorded at stations the possible reasons might be as follows first the performances of the simulation results from grid based data in the oc g case were overall good so that there was limited space for improvement in the sc g case second as a merged dataset the cmads dataset can provide a more reliable and stable precipitation input through reducing the uncertainty from multi source data thus the performances of the simulation results among years were not significantly different even in the oc g case 3 3 future variation of river discharge considering that the cmip6 datasets are also grid based datasets such as the cmads dataset and the model performances in the oc g case were overall good the calibrated parameters in the oc g case and the gcm bcc csm2 mr under four climate change scenarios i e ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 were used to predict the river discharges at the lazi station from 2021 to 2100 for the selected dataset this study analyzed the changes in annual precipitation and air temperature over the study area and the relevant results are listed in table 8 both annual precipitation and air temperature would show increasing trends in the future and annual air temperature would change more markedly than annual precipitation the increasing trends of annual air temperature under the four climate change scenarios were all statistically significant i e at the significance level of p 0 05 under the ssp1 2 6 scenario and p 0 01 under the other three scenarios in contrast for annual precipitation only the increasing trend under the ssp5 8 5 scenario was statistically significant i e at the significance level of p 0 01 fig 6 shows that the annual river discharge values will vary significantly among years increasing trends were found under the ssp1 2 6 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios and the changing rate under the ssp5 8 5 scenario i e 0 29 mm year was more than four times as large as that under the ssp1 2 6 scenario i e 0 063 mm year in contrast the annual river discharges showed decreasing trends under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp3 7 0 scenarios and the changing rate under the ssp2 4 5 scenario i e 0 10 mm year was larger than that under the ssp3 7 0 scenario i e 0 04 mm year under the ssp1 2 6 scenario river discharge might increase due to the increase of precipitation ipcc 2013 it is interesting to find that the change of river discharge turned from an increasing trend under the ssp1 2 6 scenario to a decreasing trend under the ssp2 4 5 scenario with the decrement of 0 189 mm year this can be attributed to the increase of evapotranspiration due to the increase of air temperature to a certain extent even if the radiation increases from the ssp2 4 5 scenario to the ssp3 7 0 scenario water from snow melt might ease the decreasing trend of river discharge for the ssp5 8 5 scenario the remarkable increase of river discharge might probably be related to the increase of snow melt 3 4 discussion 3 4 1 possible impacts of precipitation intensity on river discharge in the subsection 3 1 a negative correlation between precipitation and river discharge was reported based on the analysis of the total precipitation and river discharge values however other features of precipitation e g intensity may also have great effects on surface runoff and river discharge arora et al 2001 shi et al 2016b lv et al 2018 for example during the period of 2001 2004 both the smallest annual precipitation and the largest annual river discharge were found in 2001 even in the summers of these four years both the smallest precipitation and the largest river discharge were also found in 2001 table 3 such results were not consistent with the common sense on the relationship between precipitation and river discharge however regarding the maximum daily precipitation as the representative of precipitation intensity the largest value of 28 3 mm was also found in 2001 this can partly explain the unusual relationship between precipitation and river discharge wu et al 2020 pointed out that the hourly precipitation intensity increased during the warm season from may to october but decreased during the cold season from november to the next april in the yzrb during 2008 2017 attention should be paid to such trends in future studies because they might greatly change the relationship between precipitation and river discharge 3 4 2 comprehensive analysis in the upper mountainous region of the yzrb the relationship between precipitation and river discharge was not strong at both annual scale and seasonal scale in seasons with lower air temperature the correlation was even worse therefore the processes of snow melt and freeze thaw of soil and glacier which highly depend on temperature should be considered as important influencing factors due to the limits of the swat model only the process of snow melt could be integrated in the simulations through further calibration of the parameters related to temperature the accuracy of the river discharge simulation could be highly improved in this area precipitation together with the calibrated temperature parameters were highly related to river discharge 4 limitations when investigating the climate discharge relationship the following limitations should be noted first only the observed data recorded at one station i e lazi station in four years i e 2001 2004 were employed to conduct the analysis and simulation this is because it is difficult to obtain the observed river discharge data in this area although there are several grid based global river discharge datasets from a variety of sources such as model simulations cohen et al 2014 reanalysis data harrigan et al 2020 and runoff map li et al 2018 their accuracies are still not high enough to consider them as the river discharge datasets for model calibration however the 4 year data also have the representative roles in revealing the climate discharge relationship in this area second even the parameters related to snow melt has been considered in the swat model the freeze thaw processes of soil and glacier which also have certain effects on the river discharge wang et al 2018 xin et al 2021 were still ignored particularly in the upper region of the yzrb although the effects of glacier on river discharge simulation would not be more significant than those of precipitation and snow melt in terms of total volume xin et al 2021 indicated that the increase in river discharge could be dominated by the change in glacier runoff thus to develop an equivalent algorithm module for swat to simulate the freeze thaw processes of soil and glacier can be an important and meaningful task several previous studies have attempted to develop relevant methods such as soil temperature and glacier mass balance simulation omani et al 2016 qi et al 2016 there are still gaps between the existing achievements and the target which can be conducted in the future work third for the prediction of future variation of river discharge multi model simulations can be considered to analyze the uncertainties from different gcms moreover a downscaling method can be adopted to overcome the mismatch between the spatial resolution of gcms and the scale of the hru 5 conclusions the climate discharge relationship in the upper region of the yzrb was preliminarily investigated based on the observed meteorological and hydrological data at the lazi station during 2001 2004 the major findings are as follows first an unusual relationship between precipitation and river discharge which was quite different from that in the whole river basin was revealed second the performances of river discharge simulations using swat could be highly improved through separately calibrating the parameters related to snow melt third the projected river discharge during 2021 2100 would vary significantly among years with different changing rates under different climate change scenarios the outcomes of the present study can enhance our understanding of the relationship of river discharge with both precipitation and snow melt in a mountainous region especially in the context of climate change despite those above mentioned limitations it is believed that this study will be valuable for a more sustainable water resources planning and management in addition further studies can focus on 1 considering longer study period for analysis and 2 integrating the froze and thaw processes in the simulation credit authorship contribution statement suning liu writing original draft yingying yao

3957,river discharge is one of the key elements in the global water cycle however its observation and projection are still lacking in alpine regions this study analyzed the annual and seasonal variability of the river discharge in the upper region of the yarlung zangbo river basin investigated the climate discharge relationship and projected the annual trend in the next few decades 2021 2100 based on a distributed hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat results show that river discharge did not show the same trend as precipitation at either annual or seasonal scale in the study area it indicated that precipitation might not be the primary source of river discharge and meltwater from snow glacier and frozen soil could account for a large percentage of river discharge the projected river discharge would vary significantly among years with different changing rates under different climate change scenarios overall this study contributes to investigate the unusual climate discharge relationship which is different from that in the whole river basin moreover to separately consider the parameters related to snow melt could significantly improve the simulation accuracy however it could be further improved by considering the freeze and thaw processes of soil and glacier which are not included in the swat model keywords river discharge swat snow melt hydrological model yarlung zangbo river basin 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp is located in the western part of china with a total area of 2 5 million km2 as the total water resources of this region reaches 640 km3 it is well known as asia s water tower huang et al 2018 liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b there are densely distributed rivers lakes wetlands snow mountains and glaciers within this region specifically it is the headwaters region of several large rivers e g the yangtze river the yellow river the mekong lancang river the nu river the yarlung zangbo river the ganges river and the indus river in the world liu and shi 2019 for example water from the tp accounts for 25 49 and 15 of the annual river discharge of the yangtze river the yellow river and the mekong lancang river respectively in the whole tp the upper region of yarlung zangbo river basin yzrb is regarded as the vital headwater region for the water resources of china india bhutan and bangladesh this region is seldomly influenced by human activities and thus it can be regarded as the important study area for exploring the river discharge mechanisms under the influence of climate change li 2012 liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b however due to the quite high elevation i e with an average elevation of over 4000 m and complex topography this region is usually poorly gauged and it is difficult to obtain the raw hydrometeorological data even though such data are more valuable than those in the mid and down stream regions for exploring the river discharge mechanisms river discharge as the water resources directly to be used is an important factor in the water cycle the water in the yzrb can mainly be recharged from precipitation snow meltwater and glacial meltwater ban et al 2021 the meteorological elements in the yzrb can be more significantly influenced by global climate change than other regions around the world ipcc 2013 kuang and jiao 2016 xi et al 2018 ma et al 2020 which may probably affect the hydrological processes previous studies have reported increasing trends in precipitation cao and pan 2014 shi et al 2016a but decreasing trends in evaporation chen et al 2006 zhang et al 2007 over the tp in particular for the yzrb yao et al 2012 pointed out that the precipitable water vapor across this region could largely affect the energy and hydrological processes liu et al 2019a and liu et al 2019b found different trends in soil moisture changes in the upper i e a decreasing trend and lower i e an increasing trend areas during 2006 2020 using the vic variable infiltration capacity model liang et al 1994 driven by the observed meteorological data meanwhile potential evapotranspiration showed a decreasing trend over the whole yzrb during 1957 2015 ma et al 2018 in addition highly different distributions of snow cover and snow melt have been found in different seasons in the yzrb for the areas with seasonal snow cover and snow melt climate change could influence the surface runoff and further the river discharge through the changing snow cover area barnett et al 2005 most part of the upper region of the yzrb is covered by snow and some of the snow coverage belongs to seasonal snowpack and ban et al 2021 revealed that the snow melt could crucially contribute to the river discharge in the yarlung zangbo river furthermore huang et al 2018 used 1000 high spatial resolution images to obtain the information about the water surface areas and water levels to estimate the river discharge in the yzrb with the aid of the empirical equations this method could significantly improve the river discharge estimation with the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse of 0 98 however limited by a mass of data processing required in this method the time consuming is still a problem to be further addressed which may make this method hardly to be widely followed therefore it is still necessary and important to further investigate the characteristics of the river discharge which can be influenced by both precipitation and snow meltwater this study aims to reveal new findings on the climate discharge relationship in the upper region of the yzrb which are different from those in previous studies based on limited observed data for example the unusual precipitation discharge relationship which is quite different from that in the whole river basin indicates that precipitation may not be the primary source of river discharge instead snow melt which is closely related to temperature can account for a large percentage of river discharge moreover soil and water assessment tool swat was used to simulate the historic river discharge and project the future trend in the following section 2 briefly introduces the study area i e the upper region of the yzrb the research data and the methodologies used in this study section 3 presents the results and discussion including 1 analysis of station observations 2 analysis of model simulations 3 future variation of river discharge 4 discussion and 5 limitations finally section 4 summarizes the major conclusions of this study overall the outcomes of this study can be of great value for better recognizing the characteristics of the river discharge under a changing climate especially for similar source regions with the integrated effects of precipitation and snow melt 2 data and method 2 1 study area the yarlung zangbo river is the longest highland river in china with the length of 2057 km and catchment area of 0 24 million km2 in the southern tp you et al 2007 it originates from the jemajangzong glacier on the northern foothills of the himalaya mountains in southwest tibet and flows through the southern part of tibet fig 1 the mean annual precipitation is 949 mm presenting an increasing trend from the upper region i e 300 mm to the lower region i e 4000 mm liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b moreover nearly 80 of the annual precipitation occurs during the rainy season from july to september sang et al 2016 normally the mean annual potential evapotranspiration is about 1200 mm ma et al 2018 while the mean annual air temperature is about 6 c the maximum monthly mean air temperature occurs in june or july in the lower region and the minimum occurs in january ban et al 2021 in addition the mean annual river discharge of the yarlung zangbo river in the territory of china is 140 km3 yang et al 2014 it is worth noting that snow melt is an important source of river discharge in the upper region while precipitation supplies water for the river discharge in the lower region this study focuses on the region above the lazi station which is an alpine valley zone with a catchment area of 50 432 km2 the elevation of the study area is over 3950 m and the spatial distribution of the slope values is shown in fig 2 2 2 research data there are 10 meteorological stations available in the yzrb fig 1 the daily observed data e g precipitation evaporation air pressure air temperature relative humidity and wind speed from 1951 can be downloaded from the official website of china meteorological administration cma and the monthly seasonal and annual values can be derived from the daily values cma 2016 however there is no station in the region above the lazi station and the stations in the lower region are relatively far away from the study area therefore the analysis of station observations in subsection 3 1 will be based on the observed data recorded at the lazi station considering that the lazi station is also an important control hydrological station in the upper region of the yzrb the daily data recorded at this station from 2001 to 2004 are used to investigate the relationship between river discharge and meteorological variables in the study area in addition since there is no station in the region above the lazi station a grid based dataset i e cmads china meteorological assimilation driving datasets for the swat model is introduced as the supplement for analysis because this dataset has been widely used and proven to have good performances in many regions of china cao et al 2018 meng et al 2019 jiang et al 2020b wang et al 2020 the details for this dataset can be found in the study of meng and wang 2018 for river discharge simulation both the observed meteorological data recorded at all the 10 stations and the grid based dataset i e cmads are used and the relevant results will be compared the soil dataset of china provided by cold and arid region scientific data center is used fig 2 this dataset is produced based on harmonized world soil database hwsd the land use dataset of china provided by resource and environment science and data center is used in this study liu et al 2003 as shown in fig 2 the definitions of different types of soil and land use within the study area are listed in table 1 furthermore the projected meteorological datasets derived from different climate change scenarios under cmip6 coupled model intercomparison project 6 are used to predict the future variation of river discharge during 2021 2100 in the study area the relevant data can be downloaded from https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 the various climate change scenarios are proposed based on five shared socioeconomic pathways ssps which correspond to five narratives describing alternative socio economic developments i e sustainable development ssp1 middle of the road development ssp2 regional rivalry ssp3 inequality ssp4 and fossil fueled development ssp5 riahi et al 2017 the cmip6 has generated a few new scenarios using different combinations of socioeconomic pathways and nominal rcp representative concentration pathway forcing levels i e 2 6 w m2 4 5 w m2 7 0 w m2 and 8 5 w m2 knutti and sedláček 2013 for example ssp1 2 6 indicates the scenario that the radiative forcing level reaches 3 1 w m2 by the mid century but returns to 2 6 w m2 by 2100 under sustainable development the scenario model intercomparison project scenariomip for cmip6 has two tiers i e tier 1 and tier 2 of future climate change scenarios according to the priority o neill et al 2016 in this study four scenarios which belong to tier 1 are selected including ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 moreover according to the study of jiang et al 2020a it is better to use multiple global climate models gcms for analysis however based on the focus of the future prediction part of this study i e to predict the changing trend of river discharge in the study area it is not necessary to detect all the possible ranges of river discharge from multi model simulations therefore only gcm i e bcc csm2 mr is used for future prediction previous studies e g kong and sun 2021 wang et al 2021 have indicated that bcc csm2 mr is one of the most representative gcms for this study area because this dataset has a good consistency with the observation data 2 3 hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat which was developed by the u s department of agriculture usda agricultural research service ars in the 1990s arnold et al 1993 arnold et al 1998 was adopted as a platform to simulate the river discharges at the lazi station swat is a comprehensive surface groundwater flow model which has been widely used to numerous river basins worldwide wu and chen 2012 wu and chen 2013 baker and miller 2013 abbaspour et al 2015 liang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 regarding hydrological response unit hru as the basic simulation unit flügel 1996 swat can well simulate a variety of the land surface hydrological processes as well as plant growth soil erosion sediment and contamination transport and snow melt specifically for the snow melt simulation on a given day the following equation is used to estimate the daily snow melt volume neitsch et al 2009 1 sno w melt f melt s n o w cov t snow t max 2 t melt where snowmelt is the daily snow melt volume mm h2o fmelt is the snow melt factor mm h2o c day snowcov is the percentage of the hrus with snow cover tsnow is the snow pack temperature c tmax is the maximum temperature c and tmelt is the temperature threshold of snow melt c for the study area i e the region above the lazi station totally 448 hrus were set up for river discharge simulation the input meteorological data of the model were generated by using the default module named weather stations in arcswat and the temporal scale of the simulation could be daily monthly and yearly moreover swat is still undergoing continued expansion of its capabilities and there have been several versions of this model i e swat2000 arnold and fohrer 2005 swat2005 neitsch et al 2005 swat2009 neitsch et al 2009 and swat2012 arnold et al 2012a the latest version swat2012 was used for simulation and swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup was used for automatic calibration of the swat model abbaspour et al 2007 2 4 assessment criteria to quantitatively evaluate the performance of river discharge simulation at both annual and seasonal scales the following two objective functions are used as the assessment criteria relative error re and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse for assessment of the total volume of water for the simulation results the objective function re is used the equation to compute this objective function is given as 2 re v sim v obs v obs where v obs is the total volume of water derived from the observed river discharge data at the lazi station and v sim is the total volume of water derived from the simulated river discharge for assessment of the hydrograph for the simulation results the objective function nse is used the equation for nse is given as nash and sutcliffe 1970 3 nse 1 i 1 n q i sim q i obs 2 i 1 n q i obs q obs 2 where qi obs is the observed river discharge value at the lazi station on the i th day qi sim is the simulated river discharge value on the same day n is the number of days and q obs is the mean of the observed river discharge values for all the n days 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of station observations 3 1 1 comparison of grid based data with station observations station observations are normally considered to be relatively accurate and reliable at the location of a meteorological station however in regions with sparse network density grid based data are regarded as a feasible supplement for station observations mishra et al 2011 although grid based data can provide areal estimates the accuracy may not be as high as station observations for a designated point because the estimated value in each grid is the result of the retrieval within a certain range and includes considerable uncertainties shi et al 2020 therefore grid based data need to be corrected by using station observations before further analysis as there is no station in the region above the lazi station this study only compared the meteorological data recorded in the cmads grid where the lazi station locates with the observed meteorological data recorded at the lazi station and the results were used to determine the correction factors precipitation and air temperature were selected as the representative meteorological variables and the study period was consistent with the length of the river discharge data series i e from 2001 to 2004 to clear both the intra and inter annual changing patterns the following analyses were conducted at both annual and seasonal scales in this study spring includes march april and may summer includes june july and august autumn includes september october and november and winter includes december january and february this category for each season stayed the same as that in another previous study ban et al 2021 table 2 presents comparisons of grid based data with station observations for precipitation p and air temperature t at both annual and seasonal scales the systematic biases are obvious the p values from the grid based data i e p g were all higher than those from station observations i e p s while the maximum and minimum t noted as tmax and tmin hereafter values from the grid based data i e tmax g and tmin g were all lower than those from station observations i e tmax s and tmin s to make corrections in the average sense the annual values were adopted to determine the correction factors of precipitation and air temperature for precipitation the p g values were 7 20 20 and 10 higher than the p s values in 2001 2002 2003 and 2004 respectively thus the mean percentage bias was 14 during 2001 2004 for the maximum t the tmax s value was 3 5 c 3 4 c 3 3 c and 3 2 c larger than the tmax g value in 2001 2002 2003 and 2004 respectively thus the mean bias between the tmax g and tmax s values was 3 35 c during 2001 2004 for the minimum t the tmin s value was 2 1 c 2 2 c 2 2 c and 2 3 c larger than the tmin g value in 2001 2002 2003 and 2004 respectively thus the mean bias between the tmin g and tmin s values was 2 2 c during 2001 2004 in the following the mean percentage bias 14 for precipitation the mean bias 3 35 c for the maximum t and the mean bias 2 2 c for the minimum t would be used as the correction factors to correct the basin scale precipitation and air temperature calculated from the cmads dataset 3 1 2 variability of river discharge as a basic hydrometeorological variable precipitation can significantly influence the water cycle as well as the hydrological processes liu and shi 2019 normally river discharge should be closely correlated with precipitation in a given region luo and wang 2013 the basin averaged precipitation over the study area was firstly calculated from the cmads dataset and then corrected by the mean percentage bias 14 the corrected precipitation data p and the river discharge data recorded at the lazi station r at both annual and seasonal scales were used to explore the relationship between precipitation and river discharge over the region above the lazi station table 3 the p and r values were calculated separately for each year and season in this study area the interannual variation of precipitation was less significant than that of river discharge during the study period fig 3 moreover the changing trends of precipitation and river discharge were not consistent with each other which was far away from general relationship that more precipitation could generate more discharge for a given basin for example at the annual scale the minimum p i e 317 mm in 2001 was about 81 of the maximum p i e 392 mm in 2002 while the minimum r i e 87 6 mm in 2003 was about 85 of the maximum r i e 103 0 mm in 2001 in addition the p values did not show a trend from 2001 to 2004 while the r values showed an overall decreasing trend during the same period however such correlation correlation coefficient r 0 25 was not significant significance level p 0 10 with reference to the results at the seasonal scale the r values were 0 96 0 24 0 99 and 0 22 for spring summer autumn and winter respectively the correlations in spring and autumn were significant p 0 05 but the correlations in summer and winter were not significant p 0 10 previous studies have pointed out that river discharge can be directly associated with precipitation over the whole yzrb liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b but such conclusion was obtained at a relatively larger spatial scale in contrast at a relatively smaller spatial scale especially for the upper region with mass of snow cover the relationship between river discharge and precipitation might be influenced by other factors besides precipitation meltwater from snow glacier and frozen soil can be regarded as the other important sources of river discharge in this specific study area ban et al 2021 these factors can be closely related to air temperature thus their impacts on river discharge should be further investigated through analyzing air temperature for example the correlation coefficient between summer river discharge and spring precipitation i e r 0 52 was higher than that between summer river discharge and summer precipitation i e r 0 24 indicating that spring precipitation could have significant impacts on summer river discharge the reason for this is that due to low air temperature precipitation in spring may be stored in the form of snow and frozen soil instead of directly generating river discharge and then be released into the river as meltwater in summer when air temperature becomes higher in addition table 3 also lists the statistical results of potential evaporation pe at both annual and seasonal scales which were calculated from the observed evaporation data recorded at the lazi station using small pan e20 based on the method in the studies of shi et al 2014 and shi et al 2017 the conversion coefficient from small pan e20 to pe is 0 585 which is the product of the conversion coefficient i e 0 65 from small pan e20 to large pan e 601 and the conversion coefficient i e 0 90 from e 601 to pe comparing with the p s values obtained from the observed data recorded at the lazi station table 2 the pe values were much higher than the p s values over the study area for example at the annual scale the pe values were around five times as high as the p s values although the actual evaporation should be a little bit lower than pe it would still be much higher than precipitation as a result based on the water balance of a region there should be other sources of water e g meltwater from snow glacier and frozen soil to generate the river discharge 3 1 3 impacts of air temperature on river discharge the basin averaged tmax and tmin were firstly calculated from the cmads dataset and then corrected by the mean biases of 3 35 c for tmax and 2 2 c for tmin table 3 lists the statistical results of tmax and tmin at both annual and seasonal scales the interannual variations of tmax and tmin were similar with the differences of 2 2 c i e 7 0 9 2 c for tmax and 1 9 c i e 6 7to 4 8 c for tmin the variations of tmax and tmin in the same season among different years were more remarkable than the interannual variations except for summer for tmax the differences were 4 7 c 5 0 9 7 c in spring 0 5 c 15 8 16 3 c in summer 2 9 c 7 6 10 5 c in autumn and 2 2 c 0 9 1 3 c in winter for tmin the differences were 4 1 c 9 0to 4 9 c in spring 1 3 c 3 6 4 9 c in summer 2 6 c 6 1 to 3 5 c in autumn and 2 5 c 15 5 to 13 0 c in winter the air temperature difference of tmax was a little bit larger than that of tmin in spring and autumn while the air temperature difference of tmax was smaller than that of tmin in summer and winter to investigate the impacts of air temperature on river discharge in different seasons the relationships of river discharge with air temperature at the seasonal scale were further analyzed fig 4 shows that the scatters could be well fitted by linear regression and the coefficients of determination r 2 were both high i e 0 81 for tmax and 0 83 for tmin it indicated that the maximum and minimum air temperatures both had overall positive correlations with river discharge namely higher air temperatures could generally lead to larger river discharges moreover the minimum air temperature had a closer relationship with river discharge than the maximum air temperature as a result it is concluded that air temperature is an essential factor that must be considered when discussing the characteristics of river discharge in this study area ban et al 2021 3 2 analysis of model simulations 3 2 1 simulation results at the annual scale the overall performance of the simulated river discharges at the lazi station during the study period 2001 2004 was first evaluated based on the observed meteorological data recorded at stations it is worth noting that as initial conditions were needed for swat the starting year of the simulation was set to be 1998 i e 3 years before 2001 to preheat the model before parameter calibration in this study 20 parameters were automatically calibrated using swat cup and table 4 lists the values of all the calibrated parameters fig 5 shows the comparison of observations and simulations and table 5 lists the values of the selected assessment criteria at the annual scale i e re for the total volume of water and nse for the hydrograph in the oc s overall calibration based on station observations case the best simulation result had the re value of 12 and the nse value of 0 66 which were reasonable values however the simulation results could have continued improvement when looking for a deeper insight into the performance of model simulations in each year it is observed that the re value was quite large i e 35 and the nse value was quite low i e 0 27 in 2003 while the performances in other years were generally acceptable with the re values of 12 6 and the nse values of 0 68 0 77 therefore the swat model was further calibrated separately for each year based on the above analysis of station observations temperature is regarded to be an important influencing factor on snow melt glacier and frozen soil which can further affect river discharge in this area in the swat model the freeze and thaw processes of soil and glacier are not included therefore only the process of snow melt was taken into account in model simulations although ignoring the freeze and thaw processes of soil and glacier would inevitably bring errors to simulation results however such effect would not play a more decisive role in simulating river discharge than that of precipitation and snow melt it is worth noting that precipitation types e g rain snow and sleet can have great impacts on river discharge ding et al 2014 there are five parameters related to snow melt simulation in the swat model i e sftmp snowfall temperature smtmp snow melt base temperature smfmx melt factor for snow on june 21 smfmn melt factor for snow on december 21 and timp snowpack temperature lag factor among them sftmp indicates the mean air temperature at which precipitation can be rain or snow with equal likelihood therefore the precipitation data can be directly used for simulation and will be distinguished as snow or rain by the swat model these five parameters were further calibrated while keeping the other parameters unchanged the details of these parameters can be found in arnold et al 2012b sftmp and smtmp have the same range of 5 5 c smfmx and smfmn have the same range of 1 4 6 9 mm h2o c day and timp has the range of 0 01 1 0 the calibrated parameters for the whole study period as well as each year are listed in table 6 compared to the calibrated parameters for the whole study period only the value of timp was changed in 2001 and 2002 which indicated that the influence of the previous day s snowpack temperature on the current day s snowpack temperature could not be ignored in contrast in 2003 and 2004 the values of the other four parameters were changed which indicated that the threshold values of snowfall and snow melt and the impact of snowpack density on snow melt were the more important factors based on these calibrated parameters the newly simulated river discharges at the lazi station in each year were obtained and the performances of the simulation results are also listed in table 5 in the sc s separate calibration based on station observations case the re values were all within 10 and smaller than those in the oc s case the nse values were all over 0 80 and higher than those in the oc s case in particular the most significant improvement was found in 2003 with the re value of 9 from 35 and the nse value of 0 88 from 0 27 3 2 2 simulation results at the seasonal scale considering the significant variations of river discharge precipitation and air temperature among different seasons performances of the simulation results at the seasonal scale were further evaluated table 7 lists the values of the selected assessment criteria in general significant improvements were found in summer and autumn for the whole study period e g the re values decreased from 12 and 13 in the oc s case to 3 and 10 in the sc s case and the nse values increased from 0 50 and 0 56 in the oc s case to 0 85 and 0 75 in the sc s case moreover the improvement in spring was truly little while the performance in winter in the sc s case was even worse than that in the oc s case with reference to a single year similar results were obtained in most summers and autumns except for autumn in 2004 swat performed better in the sc s case than in the oc s case according to the re values table 7 in springs swat performed better in the sc s case than in the oc s case in two years i e 2001 and 2002 but worse in the other two i e 2003 and 2004 in all winters swat performed worse in the sc s case than in the oc s case therefore it is concluded that swat cannot work well in the situation when river discharge is mainly supplied by snow melt e g winter and spring 3 2 3 comparison of simulation results from grid based data with those from station data simulation results from the cmads dataset were compared with those from the observed data recorded at the lazi station to verify the effectiveness of the cmads dataset in the upper region of the yzrb the river discharges simulated from the cmads dataset in the oc g and sc g cases are shown in fig 5 and the relevant assessment criteria are listed in table 5 it is observed that the simulation results from grid based data had better performance than those from station data especially in baseflow simulation in the oc g case the best simulation result had the re value of 3 and the nse value of 0 76 which was better than the best simulation result from the observed meteorological data recorded at stations i e re 12 and nse 0 66 the differences between the model performances in these four years were less significant especially for the nse values ranging from 0 72 to 0 80 for the year 2003 which could not be well simulated using the station observations the re value was 0 and the nse value was 0 73 indicating that the cmads dataset could have better performance in river discharge simulation in this area although the overall performances of the cmads dataset were better than those of station observations there were still exceptions for example the re values were 16 6 in 2002 and 22 larger than 12 in 2004 and the nse value in 2002 was 0 72 lower than 0 77 in subsection 3 2 1 it is found that for the observed meteorological data recorded at stations to separately calibrate the parameters related to snow melt could significantly improve the simulation accuracy separate calibration was also conducted in each year for the cmads dataset in the sc g case the re values were all within 4 and smaller than those in the oc g case the nse values were all over 0 75 and higher than those in the oc g case table 5 however the improvements were not as significant as those for the observed meteorological data recorded at stations the possible reasons might be as follows first the performances of the simulation results from grid based data in the oc g case were overall good so that there was limited space for improvement in the sc g case second as a merged dataset the cmads dataset can provide a more reliable and stable precipitation input through reducing the uncertainty from multi source data thus the performances of the simulation results among years were not significantly different even in the oc g case 3 3 future variation of river discharge considering that the cmip6 datasets are also grid based datasets such as the cmads dataset and the model performances in the oc g case were overall good the calibrated parameters in the oc g case and the gcm bcc csm2 mr under four climate change scenarios i e ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 were used to predict the river discharges at the lazi station from 2021 to 2100 for the selected dataset this study analyzed the changes in annual precipitation and air temperature over the study area and the relevant results are listed in table 8 both annual precipitation and air temperature would show increasing trends in the future and annual air temperature would change more markedly than annual precipitation the increasing trends of annual air temperature under the four climate change scenarios were all statistically significant i e at the significance level of p 0 05 under the ssp1 2 6 scenario and p 0 01 under the other three scenarios in contrast for annual precipitation only the increasing trend under the ssp5 8 5 scenario was statistically significant i e at the significance level of p 0 01 fig 6 shows that the annual river discharge values will vary significantly among years increasing trends were found under the ssp1 2 6 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios and the changing rate under the ssp5 8 5 scenario i e 0 29 mm year was more than four times as large as that under the ssp1 2 6 scenario i e 0 063 mm year in contrast the annual river discharges showed decreasing trends under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp3 7 0 scenarios and the changing rate under the ssp2 4 5 scenario i e 0 10 mm year was larger than that under the ssp3 7 0 scenario i e 0 04 mm year under the ssp1 2 6 scenario river discharge might increase due to the increase of precipitation ipcc 2013 it is interesting to find that the change of river discharge turned from an increasing trend under the ssp1 2 6 scenario to a decreasing trend under the ssp2 4 5 scenario with the decrement of 0 189 mm year this can be attributed to the increase of evapotranspiration due to the increase of air temperature to a certain extent even if the radiation increases from the ssp2 4 5 scenario to the ssp3 7 0 scenario water from snow melt might ease the decreasing trend of river discharge for the ssp5 8 5 scenario the remarkable increase of river discharge might probably be related to the increase of snow melt 3 4 discussion 3 4 1 possible impacts of precipitation intensity on river discharge in the subsection 3 1 a negative correlation between precipitation and river discharge was reported based on the analysis of the total precipitation and river discharge values however other features of precipitation e g intensity may also have great effects on surface runoff and river discharge arora et al 2001 shi et al 2016b lv et al 2018 for example during the period of 2001 2004 both the smallest annual precipitation and the largest annual river discharge were found in 2001 even in the summers of these four years both the smallest precipitation and the largest river discharge were also found in 2001 table 3 such results were not consistent with the common sense on the relationship between precipitation and river discharge however regarding the maximum daily precipitation as the representative of precipitation intensity the largest value of 28 3 mm was also found in 2001 this can partly explain the unusual relationship between precipitation and river discharge wu et al 2020 pointed out that the hourly precipitation intensity increased during the warm season from may to october but decreased during the cold season from november to the next april in the yzrb during 2008 2017 attention should be paid to such trends in future studies because they might greatly change the relationship between precipitation and river discharge 3 4 2 comprehensive analysis in the upper mountainous region of the yzrb the relationship between precipitation and river discharge was not strong at both annual scale and seasonal scale in seasons with lower air temperature the correlation was even worse therefore the processes of snow melt and freeze thaw of soil and glacier which highly depend on temperature should be considered as important influencing factors due to the limits of the swat model only the process of snow melt could be integrated in the simulations through further calibration of the parameters related to temperature the accuracy of the river discharge simulation could be highly improved in this area precipitation together with the calibrated temperature parameters were highly related to river discharge 4 limitations when investigating the climate discharge relationship the following limitations should be noted first only the observed data recorded at one station i e lazi station in four years i e 2001 2004 were employed to conduct the analysis and simulation this is because it is difficult to obtain the observed river discharge data in this area although there are several grid based global river discharge datasets from a variety of sources such as model simulations cohen et al 2014 reanalysis data harrigan et al 2020 and runoff map li et al 2018 their accuracies are still not high enough to consider them as the river discharge datasets for model calibration however the 4 year data also have the representative roles in revealing the climate discharge relationship in this area second even the parameters related to snow melt has been considered in the swat model the freeze thaw processes of soil and glacier which also have certain effects on the river discharge wang et al 2018 xin et al 2021 were still ignored particularly in the upper region of the yzrb although the effects of glacier on river discharge simulation would not be more significant than those of precipitation and snow melt in terms of total volume xin et al 2021 indicated that the increase in river discharge could be dominated by the change in glacier runoff thus to develop an equivalent algorithm module for swat to simulate the freeze thaw processes of soil and glacier can be an important and meaningful task several previous studies have attempted to develop relevant methods such as soil temperature and glacier mass balance simulation omani et al 2016 qi et al 2016 there are still gaps between the existing achievements and the target which can be conducted in the future work third for the prediction of future variation of river discharge multi model simulations can be considered to analyze the uncertainties from different gcms moreover a downscaling method can be adopted to overcome the mismatch between the spatial resolution of gcms and the scale of the hru 5 conclusions the climate discharge relationship in the upper region of the yzrb was preliminarily investigated based on the observed meteorological and hydrological data at the lazi station during 2001 2004 the major findings are as follows first an unusual relationship between precipitation and river discharge which was quite different from that in the whole river basin was revealed second the performances of river discharge simulations using swat could be highly improved through separately calibrating the parameters related to snow melt third the projected river discharge during 2021 2100 would vary significantly among years with different changing rates under different climate change scenarios the outcomes of the present study can enhance our understanding of the relationship of river discharge with both precipitation and snow melt in a mountainous region especially in the context of climate change despite those above mentioned limitations it is believed that this study will be valuable for a more sustainable water resources planning and management in addition further studies can focus on 1 considering longer study period for analysis and 2 integrating the froze and thaw processes in the simulation credit authorship contribution statement suning liu writing original draft yingying yao

3958,alpine catchments are severely impacted by climate change and have been extensively studied from glaciological and hydrological perspectives however groundwater in such catchments is rarely mentioned and the role of the groundwater system in sustaining streamflow in alpine catchments remains unknown this study used an integrated framework with multi tracer data major ions and isotopes 2h 3h 18o and sr to identify seasonal water sources and to uncover the recharge discharge mechanism of the river groundwater system in the middle reaches of the yarlungzangbo river yr the results show that surface waters collected in the dry season major ions exhibit higher solute concentrations and stable isotopes h and o are more enriched in river water than in the wet season in addition river δ18o values exhibit a distinct spatial variation that decreases and then increases along the flow direction in the dry season but this is greatly attenuated during the wet season estimation results show that groundwater maintains the winter spring baseflow contributing 45 1 including the discharge of deep circulating groundwater through macro structures such as south north oriented active tensile faults contributing 19 6 9 9 during the wet season precipitation contributing 31 0 3 6 and tributaries contributing 30 0 8 2 are the principal recharge end members of the river water the rapid recharge of phreatic groundwater occurs in alpine regions through faults and fissures like the yr basin the phreatic groundwater system is primarily maintained by modern meltwater and precipitation originating from oceanic moisture the groundwater is younger than 20 years and recharges at a seasonal scale precipitation is likely the principal mechanism governing annual river flow and water level variations therefore groundwater storage and total runoff in the yr basin will increase greatly with climate warming in tibet simultaneously hydrological accidents are also likely to occur requiring advanced monitoring and prevention measures keywords river groundwater system isotopes spatiotemporal variability water circulation alpine catchment 1 introduction changes in temperature and precipitation patterns in the context of global climate change have a profound impact on regional ecosystems the water cycle and human activities pronounced warming and increasing precipitation trends in past decades have increased high temperature and heavy rainfall events observed at meteorological stations bahir et al 2020 chen and sun 2018 kang et al 2010 li et al 2019 gao et al 2019 the tibetan plateau tp the third pole of the world can influence the development and evolution of the global climate system and is sensitive to global climate change the mean annual temperature in the northeastern tp has increased by approximately 0 9 c over the past 30 years zhao et al 2004 the tp is also known as the water tower of asia with glacier and permafrost areas of 12 000 and 122 2 104 km2 respectively meltwater from the region ensures the perennial flow of major river systems in asia however numerous glaciers are shrinking particularly in the southeastern tp yao et al 2012a xiang et al 2016 and li et al 2014 attributed the rapid expansion of namco lake and the increased groundwater reserves in the eastern tp to accelerated glacier melt in addition recent literature reports accelerating rates of permafrost thaw which is expected to have cascading effects on the high latitude environment river flow regimes and associated biogeochemical interactions lu et al 2020 therefore quantifying the hydrological changes of alpine catchments and predicting future water resource changes are necessary an in depth understanding of how contemporary and future responses to environmental change affect the spatio temporal dynamics of runoff generation processes is a key step for answering these questions the yarlungzangbo river yr in the southern tp is the highest large river in the world and contributes abundant freshwater to the bay of bengal however the understanding of hydrological fluxes in the yr system and their response to basin specific characteristics remains limited due to a lack of systematic investigations and measurements water isotopes 18o 2h 3h and sr and hydrochemistry have a great potential for tracing climatological and hydrological processes and have been used extensively in water cycle research tian et al 2007 li and garzione 2017 li et al 2020 existing isotope hydrology studies primarily focus on precipitation formation mechanisms especially moisture sources and the topographical effect and the hydrologic dynamics of runoff in the central and eastern parts of the yr for instance the isotopic composition of precipitation in the eastern yr basin exhibits a profound altitude effect primarily due to the orographic lifting and adiabatic cooling of monsoonal moisture in summer hren et al 2009 gao et al 2010 ren et al 2017 tian et al 2020 ren et al 2018 documented the changing isotope composition in summer flow along the principal stream of the yr δ18o values decreased from the headwaters to the middle reaches but increased from the middle to lower reaches this is because oceanic moisture is transported from the south which significantly depletes isotopes ren et al 2016 ren et al 2018 tian et al 2001 cuo et al 2014 systematically reviewed surface runoff characteristics including yr water in the tp and provided a preliminary prediction of future trends in the context of global warming the study also indicated that ice snow meltwater is an important water source in alpine regions on the edge of the tp due to the limitations of natural conditions and current research the impact of groundwater on rivers is rarely considered and the effect of groundwater on the glaciated catchments that feed most rivers on the tp is unknown in addition previous studies generally paid more attention to summer rivers and ignored the completely different water source partitioning in the dry and wet seasons of large rivers in alpine catchments e g the yr or simply considered the hydrological process and ignored the tectonic background of the study area these omissions significantly limit the evaluation of present and future water resources we recently analyzed yr monitoring data in the dry season and provided preliminary insights into the role of groundwater in alpine catchments tan et al 2021 however due to limited data and a shortage of wet season samples annual water source partitioning and the mechanisms governing the seasonal recharge discharge of the river groundwater system in the yr catchment remain unclear therefore analyzing the interconnection and dynamics of regional aquifers and river water in the context of global climate change provides a new perspective for understanding the water cycle in the alpine catchment and a basic reference for avoiding an imbalance between the supply and demand of water resources in coming decades in this study the so called one river two tributaries area in the middle reaches of the yr was selected as the study area and the dry and wet seasons were selected as the study periods the hydrological cycle of the alpine catchment was modeled by stable h o and sr isotopes radioactive 3h isotopes and hydrochemical methods the principal objectives of this study were 1 to provide clear hydrogeochemical and isotopic evidence for surface groundwater seasonal recharge sources in the yr basin 2 to estimate the contribution of various potential recharge end members to river flow in different seasons and 3 to explore the climate response characteristics of rivers for predicting future water resource trends in the basin the technical novelties of this study are the integration of isotope hydrochemistry with tectonic geology and the use of key tracer technologies with multi index coupling to track hydrological circulation processes scientific achievements include understanding water source partitioning on a seasonal scale in an alpine catchment and revealing the potential impact of groundwater on river discharge in the dry and wet seasons 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yr is a typical large river draining the high altitude cold area of the tp the basin is controlled by westerlies from october to may and precipitation is rare after mid june the warm moist air masses from the bay of bengal are blocked by the himalayas and move upward along the yr valley bringing precipitation to the southern part of the tp hren et al 2009 tian et al 2007 yao et al 2012b the study area is the one river two tributaries area of the yr which refers to the area along the principal river from lazi to yangcun and two major tributaries the nianchu river rising on the northern slope of the himalayas and the lhasa river rising from the nyainqntanglha mountains fig 1 this region is the most important and richest agricultural area in the tibet autonomous region the scale of human activity is large and the consumption and utilization rates of water resources are high the recharge and circulation of river groundwater largely determine the hydrological process of the entire yr this study uses isotope variations tectonics and physiography to divide the study area into the western section ws middle section ms and eastern section es fig 1c the ws ms and es extend over 86 88 e 88 91 e the area affected by the fault zone and 91 93 e respectively the tp began to be uplifted in 55 50 ma because of the india asia collision ongoing n s convergence between india and asia has resulted in a series of large scale strike slip faults and sutures distributed around the terrane boundaries harrison et al 1992 kapp et al 2005 the modern yr flows along the suture from west to east and bends to the south cutting a deep gorge through the himalayas tan et al 2020 nearly n s trending grabens and rifts developed in en echelon arrays terminate in strike slip faults at the center of the plateau and the southern flank of the himalayas fig 2 the rifts which can be up to 300 km long and 15 km wide are potential conduits for the deep circulation of meltwater into high mountains su et al 2020 in each fault zone groundwater discharge through hot springs likely occurs at the lowest topographic point which is at the intersection with the yr tan et al 2014 the dingjie xietongmen shenzha dxs and yadong dangxiong gulu ydg faults intersect at the middle reaches of the yr and are the two largest transverse rift zones in the basin many geothermal springs e g in the guoqiong chabu molong and yangbajin geothermal fields near the dxs and ydg faults discharge into the yr valley within the yr drainage basin rocks exposed to the north of the yr are primarily cretaceous to cenozoic granitoids of the gangdese batholith and the linzizong volcanic successions with local quaternary sediments of various origins to the south the tributaries drain paleozoic mesozoic tethyan himalayan strata pan et al 2004 2 2 sampling and measurements field observations and sampling were conducted in early may 2018 2019 and early september 2018 fig 1 because the yr is in an alpine region early may is characterized by the end of the dry season before the onset of large scale ice and snow melt and monsoon precipitation early september is characterized by the end of the wet season the basin was fully replenished by precipitation in july and august and re adjusted in september to avoid the impact of heavy rainfall events on rivers and groundwater samples for analysis of 2h 3h o and sr isotopes and major ions were collected as follows 1 precipitation samples for h and o isotopes were collected from a rain gauge at weather stations in rikaze and lhasa from 2017 to 2019 table s1 2 river water was collected along the yr nianchu and lhasa rivers samples were taken at least 1 m away from the riverbank using a stainless steel collector tables s2 and s3 3 groundwater was primarily sampled from civil wells some samples were from monitoring wells in the yr basin table s4 shows the basic hydrological information water from monitoring wells was collected using a stainless steel sampler 1 m below the water surface water from civil wells was collected through extraction by a bore hole turbine pump 4 geothermal water was sampled from hot springs near the dxs and ydg faults at the time of sampling the electrical conductivity ph and temperature were measured in the field using standard hand held calibrated field meters measurements of stable h and o isotopes and major ions were performed at the state key laboratory of hydrology water resources and hydraulic engineering hohai university china the 2h 1h and 18o 16o ratios were measured on a mat253 mass spectrometer the results were reported relative to vsmow with an analytical precision 1σ of 1 2 and 0 2 0 3 respectively cation concentrations were measured by icp aes with 5

scintillation counting tri carb 3170 tr sl the results were expressed as absolute concentrations using tritium units tu after sample enrichment the precision was improved to more than 0 8 tu tables s1

emma method using chemical isotopic compositions of water the changing composition of water can be considered to result from intersections during its passage through different landscapes the calculations are expressed as follows 1 1 i 1 n f i c m j i 1 n f i c i j j 1 k where fi denotes the proportion of water source i and n refers to the number of end members c m j denotes the tracer j incorporated in component i for more than three end members the isosource model is an effective tool for calculating the contribution ratios phillips and gregg 2003 in this study δ18o and δd data were used in the model because they have a wide range of values and are almost uninfluenced by water rock interactions during runoff processes frauke et al 2011 the model was executed with a fractional increment of 1 and an uncertainty level of 0 1 2 3 2 hydrograph separation uncertainty the uncertainty of tracer based hydrograph separations was calculated using the error propagation technique which considers the errors of all the separation equation variables assuming that the contribution of a specific streamflow component to streamflow is a function of several variables c1 c2 cn and that the uncertainty of each variable is independent of the uncertainty of others the relative error δf of the target variable f is related to the uncertainty in all variables as following li et al 2020 2 δ f 1 f f c 1 δ c 1 2 f c 2 δ c 2 2 f c n δ c n 2 where δci i 1 n represents the uncertainty of the corresponding ci 1 n in this study the standard deviation was defined as the uncertainty δci of the variable specified by the subscript the software package matlab was used to apply eq 1 for the hydrograph separation in this study 2 3 3 radioactive decay of tritium isotopes tritium is an effective tracer for studying groundwater age and recharge renewal in the yr basin groundwater is quickly recharged by rainfall infiltration and provides aquifer water with isotopic values almost the same as those of the atmosphere in an idealized state groundwater is recharged by precipitation in the piedmont alluvial fan and movement is driven by piston flow the decay of 3h is only a function of time

constant of 3h λ 0 055764 2 3 4 recharge elevation the δ18o and δd values of precipitation decrease as elevation increases this elevation effect is often used to determine the infiltration height of

value of groundwater δp denotes the δ18o value of meteoric water near the sampling point and k denotes the decreasing δ18o gradient with elevation 100 m 3 results 3 1 water chemistry the total dissolved solids tds and major ion concentrations of river water are generally higher in the dry season than in the wet season because of the dilution of river water by heavy summer precipitation as well as the higher evaporation rate in dry season with almost no precipitation dilution figs 3 and 4 in the dry season tds is higher in the ms 156 81 mg l than in the ws 105 40 mg l es 95 56 mg l and tributary of lhasa river 95 56 mg l but markedly lower than in the nianchu river 203 15 mg l and geothermal water 1191 52 mg l table 1 major ion concentrations show similar characteristics and a significant peak in na 78 13 mg l cl 65 70 mg l and so4 2 57 06 mg l in the ms in the wet season the tds and ion concentration of the river water decrease slightly along the flow direction tds 99 66 mg l and ion concentration in the ms are similar to those in phreatic groundwater 94 64 mg l ca2 and na are dominant ions in the dry season and ca2 and mg2 are dominant in the wet season in the yr the water chemical types vary from hco3 so4 ca and hco3 cl na in may to hco3 ca mg in september the anomalous water chemistry of the river water near the dxs and ydg fault zones hco3 cl na is similar to that of geothermal water fig 5 the principal water chemistry types of phreatic groundwater are dominated by hco3 ca mg and hco3 so4 ca with minor seasonal changes geothermal water is characterized by cl na cl hco3 na and hco3 cl na types owing to long term hydrochemical evolution 3 2 stable h and o isotopes of different water bodies the δ18o and δd values of winter spring precipitation range from 17 86 to 5 44 and 132 3 to 45 76 with weighted mean values of 13 11 and 91 78 respectively the isotopes are significantly depleted in summer precipitation with δ18o and δd values from 31 49 to 14 54 and 210 0 to 110 5 with weighted averages of 23 40 and 175 1 respectively table 1 the δ18o δd plot of precipitation shows a significant linear correlation δd 7 19δ18o 4 44 r2 0 95 n 98 which can be used to represent the information of the local meteoric water line lmwl within a hydrological year fig 6 most samples of different water bodies river and groundwater fall on or near the lmwl indicating that the water samples did not undergo significant evaporation or other fractionation effects during precipitation infiltration or inflow into streams the stable h and o isotopes of the main river in the middle reaches of the yr also exhibit significant temporal and spatial variabilities with enrichment and depletion during the dry and wet seasons respectively fig 7 the δ18o and δd values of the river water in the dry season ranged from 18 26 to 15 79 and 140 3 to 118 8 whereas those in the wet season ranged from 22 18 to 20 34 and 159 1 to 147 4 respectively table 1 the tributaries showed similar seasonal variations the average δ18o and δd values of the nianchu and lhasa rivers were from 16 11 to 120 1 and 16 73 to 123 5 may and 18 11 to 134 7 and 18 50 to 133 9 september respectively stable isotopes of the ws and two major recharge tributaries the lhasa and nianchu rivers were significantly spatially enriched the lowest values of δ18o and δd appeared in the ms and es during the dry and wet seasons respectively fig 7 the δ18o and δd in phreatic groundwater varied from 21 16 to 16 99 and 157 5 to 128 4 respectively demonstrating a close seasonal response to river water table 1 and figs 6 and 7 the surface water and groundwater in the yr basin are controlled by seasonal recharge sources which are unique among groundwater recharge systems in arid and semi arid zones the geothermal water was collected only in may the δ18o and δd were distributed from 21 51 to 17 51 and 166 8 to 142 0 respectively which is close to the variation range of groundwater in the wet season 3 3 tritium and strontium isotopes the spatial variation of 3h isotopes in the water samples also reflects the hydraulic relationship between different water bodies fig 8 the 3h value of the yr gradually decreases from lazi to the estuary of the lhasa river with a range of 7 98 10 68 tu the mean value is close to that of phreatic groundwater significant characteristics were noted first the 3h value of the river water in the rikaze wetland drops sharply second the 3h value of the river water in the ygd fault is lower than that of phreatic groundwater the sr isotopes in the main river do not have substantial spatial variations with a range of 0 71049 0 71194 average value of 0 71136 which is significantly lower than the average value in nianchu river 0 71490 table s3 the lhasa river has a relatively low sr isotope ratio avg 0 71037 and a relatively high sr concentration avg 0 715 mg l fig 9 the 87sr 86sr value in phreatic groundwater is close to that of the main river with a small range of 0 70928 0 71312 the sr isotopic ratio of most geothermal water approximately 0 708 is close to the range of marine carbonates the lowest observed value 0 704 is close to the range of mantle derived magma or late crystallized granite 4 discussion 4 1 recharge sources 4 1 1 source of precipitation moisture precipitation in the yr basin exhibits significant spatiotemporal variations the multi year temperature and precipitation records of weather stations in rikaze and lhasa show that the dry season generally spans from late september october to the end of april early may of the following year no large scale melting of snow glaciers or heavy precipitation events occur during this period which only featured sporadic light rain or snowfall fig 10 a and b the river and groundwater level declined and maintained a low flow rate the wet season occurs during late may september precipitation of 420 1 and 497 6 mm accounting for 92 1 and 87 6 of annual precipitation occur in rikaze and lhasa respectively the temperature fluctuates with monthly precipitation the highest temperature of 17 6 c was recorded in june 2019 this typical plateau monsoon climate is wet in summer due to the influence of ocean currents and dry and cold in winter due to internal continental circulation the h and o isotopes also show substantial seasonal variations in precipitation the δ18o value of precipitation in the winter spring is higher than that during the monsoon period fig 6 the d excess is widely used to track the moisture source of precipitation in general precipitation derived from marine moisture evaporated under humid conditions has relatively low d excess whereas that derived from recycled moisture evaporated under low humidity has relatively high d excess ren et al 2017 the weighted average of the d excess of precipitation in the yr is higher in winter spring and lower in summer table s1 therefore summer precipitation primarily originates from marine moisture and is significantly affected by the southwest indian ocean monsoon the relatively high δ18o and d excess in the dry season reflect moisture circulation on the plateau moisture from the westerly belt has particularly high d excess values in the δ18o δd plot fig 6 the isotopic range of precipitation covers that of river water groundwater and glacial meltwater the aggregation towards the end member of monsoon precipitation indicates that winter spring precipitation has a weak impact on the hydrological process of the basin 4 1 2 river water recharge source the seasonal differences in river water isotopes are significant especially in 2018 fig 10c all data quoted in the figure are from yr river water samples close to the collection site of river water samples in this study see table s5 for specific data and reference information from the dry season to the wet season the average δ18o varies by 20 this fluctuation is not common in other major rivers in china such as the yangtze wu et al 2018 and heihe yang et al 2011 the summer precipitation in 2018 was the highest in recent decades and the total precipitation from june to september in rikaze was 36 1 higher than the average precipitation over the past 15 years 433 5 mm fig 10d additionally the positive correlation between the seasonal variation of isotopes and precipitation reflects the dependence of the river water isotopes on summer precipitation in addition the spatial variations of isotopes in different seasons show different trends implying a difference in water sources and hydrological processes in the dry and wet seasons the dry season values of δ18o and δd near the dxs and ydg faults ms were significantly lower than those in the ws es and tributaries fig 7 the isotope characteristics after the upstream inflow ws mixed with the tributary of the nianchu river should have been significantly enriched rather than depleted indicating that other end member mixed with a depleted isotopic source to maintain the significantly negative isotope pattern in the middle section of the yr in the middle reaches of the yr the isotopes δ18o δd of river water and groundwater show similar seasonal responses figs 6 and 7 reflecting the hydraulic connection between surface water and groundwater in the dry season the concentration of radioactive 3h in the river water decreases significantly in the rikaze wetland indicating the discharge of phreatic groundwater from the rikaze wetland to the yr fig 8 the contribution of phreatic groundwater to runoff in dry season has also been mentioned in other alpine catchments such as the alps where groundwater flow contribution does play an important role in rock glacier spring discharge especially during the winter months or periods of little recharge wagner et al 2021 in addition deep circulating groundwater is another potential source of river water andermann et al 2012 and remains in aquifers for a relatively long time hco3 cl na type water forms after a long period of evolution and appears in the winter spring base water fig 5 the tds and ion concentrations of river water increase in the ms the concentrations of na and cl increase significantly near the fault zone reflecting the substantial discharge of deep circulating groundwater in the ms of the yr figs 3 and 4 overall the recharge source of the river water in the dry season is upstream inflow tributaries and the discharge of deep and phreatic groundwater emma and the calculated uncertainty revealed the contribution rates and uncertainty of each end member table 2 the results show that groundwater plays an important role in maintaining the winter spring baseflow with a contribution rate of 45 1 whereof deep circulating groundwater accounts for 19 6 9 9 the uncertainty is 0 309 most of the uncertainty in this study is attributed to variations in and differences among tracer concentrations for runoff components despite the uncertainties isotope based hydrograph separation remains to be a valuable tool for evaluating the contribution of groundwater to rivers and is particularly helpful for improving our understanding of hydrological processes in cold regions that lack observational data in the wet season river waters from the ws of the yr have the highest δ18o river waters from the es have the lowest δ18o fig 7 from the ws to the es water first progressively deviates from the lmwl and then progressively approaches or exceeds the lmwl fig 6 from a climatological perspective the hydrological process of the basin is influenced by the monsoon system in the east and the westerly system in the west fig 1a ren et al 2017 monsoon derived precipitation is characterized by low δ18o and d excess whereas westerly derived precipitation is characterized by high δ18o and d excess previous isotopic studies have revealed specific controls on precipitation in the southern tp hren et al 2009 ren et al 2016 ren et al 2018 kong et al 2019 the ms is in the transitional zone between the westerlies and monsoon derived water vapor from the ocean the increasing influence of the westerlies towards the eastern ms and the decreasing influence of the monsoon toward the western ms largely explain the westward increase in the δ18o of the surface waters fig 7 however the significantly depleted trend of isotopes in the ms relative to those in the lower reaches in the dry season do not appear in the wet season primarily because the contribution of heavy summer precipitation with relatively enriched isotopes is much larger than that of other sources the gradual depletion of isotopes along the summer runoff direction is attributed to spatial differences in moist air masses in the δ18o δd plot fig 6 the river water samples in september fall on an end member that is more depleted than meltwater phreatic groundwater and even geothermal water therefore summer precipitation is the principal source of the river in the wet season groundwater and other sources are also important components of river water 87sr 86sr 1 sr plot fig 9 which indicates the mixed recharge by other potential end members in the wet season the entire river system can be expressed as the result of the weathering of the two end members the first end member represented by geothermal water has a notably high sr content and a low sr isotopic ratio most sr isotopes are close to 0 708 suggesting the weathering of carbonate rocks the lower sr isotopic ratios of a few samples especially those approximately equal to 0 705 are related to mantle derived fluids or water rock interactions e g granites in deep high temperature environments the second end member originates from the weathering of silicate surface rocks and is represented by the nianchu river which has a low sr content and a high sr isotope ratio the sr isotope ratio in the middle reaches of the yr is higher than that produced by carbonate rock weathering but lower than that produced by silicate rock weathering possibly due to the weathering of different rocks and the input of different end members the isosource model results showed that the contribution rate of precipitation was 31 0 3 6 with an uncertainly of 0 316 the proportion of groundwater was lower at 25 3 8 7 table 2 there was abundant summer precipitation in 2018 which was the greatest in recent decades therefore the estimated ratio may represent an extreme situation however the contribution of recharge end members in the wet and dry seasons in the yr varies greatly and is the primary reason for seasonal differences in river water isotopes 4 1 3 recharge source of groundwater groundwater recharge in arid basins or catchments is generally relatively slow and isotopic changes on a seasonal scale tend to be weakened or homogenized during recharge for example the groundwater in the north china plain and the ordos basin was recharged during the geological period and the seasonal effect of isotopes cannot be identified chen et al 2011 ma et al 2018 however the stable isotopic composition of the phreatic groundwater in the yr is quite different in the dry and wet seasons with an average difference of 11 2 this reflects seasonal recharge sources and hydrogeological characteristics of rapid groundwater circulation tritium is an important indicator for determining the age and renewal rate of groundwater the 3h concentration is generally only a function of time during the precipitation recharge and transport processes of groundwater if the 3h concentration of a phreatic groundwater sample 8 27 tu is known the 3h concentration curve of the groundwater before 2018 can be obtained according to eq 3 that is y 8 27 e 0 055764 2018 x the precipitation 3h concentration curve of the tp and its adjacent study area were plotted fig 11 for lhasa kunming urumqi xindeli and ottawa iaea wmo iaea wmo 2019 this curve and inversion curve of precipitation 3h in adjacent areas intersect at approximately 1990 and the precipitation 3h content of approximately 50 tu is much higher than that in lhasa during the same period if the 3h concentration in the precipitation in lhasa is taken as the background value the inversion curve of groundwater decay intersects after 2000 therefore the 3h age of phreatic groundwater in yr is approximately 0 20 years indicating a relatively fast renewal rate in general significant changes in h and o isotopes are not visible in groundwater at least the interannual scale research shows that less than 6 of the world s modern groundwater recharge gleeson et al 2016 which means modern recharge is generally rarely happened why can groundwater of the yr achieve rapid circulation and renewal rate even seasonal recharge in some areas can be identified this may be closely related to the seasonal variation of supply sources during the dry season precipitation intensity is low and the proportion of vertical infiltration to aquifer recharge is low the δ18o δd and 3h values of phreatic groundwater are very close to those of the meltwater of karola glacier figs 6 and 9 therefore high altitude glacial meltwater may be the principal source of groundwater in the dry season glacial meltwater maintains baseflow or supplies main recharge source these hydrological scenarios have also been observed in other alpine regions such as alps pyrenees and andes where high altitude meltwater provides a rich source of groundwater brown et al 2006 wagner et al 2021 liaudat et al 2020 according to the calculation of groundwater recharge elevation the average recharge elevation of phreatic groundwater of the yr at approximately 5385 m table 3 is close to that of the karola mountains thus glacial meltwater from the source area of the nianchu river infiltrates along the thick glacial or fluvial deposits in the unsaturated zone and recharges the phreatic groundwater in the middle reaches of the yr in the wet season the h and o isotopes of phreatic groundwater are more depleted than in the dry season indicating that summer precipitation contributes a large proportion of infiltrated groundwater recharge field work showed that the groundwater level rose significantly in september and flooded the main road from lhasa to rikaze the dynamic change of the groundwater level was basically consistent with that of the river water further proving the strong influence of summer precipitation on groundwater the outlet temperature of geothermal water in hot springs is generally higher than 30 c and can exceed the local boiling point 80 c the water is heated at depth and is ejected at a high temperature and pressure on the δ18o δd plot fig 6 most geothermal water sample points fall near the lmwl indicating that geothermal water also originates from local precipitation however the recharge source of geothermal water is different from that of the rivers and should be more depleted in d and 18o isotopes because all geothermal water samples plot to the right below the river and groundwater therefore geothermal water sources may be located at a higher elevation than the recharge source of the river phreatic groundwater this is also indicated by the average recharge elevation of geothermal water 6111 m table 3 which is close to that of the surrounding mountains peaks approximately 6000 m for the himalayan mountains to the south and 5500 6000 m for the tanglha mountains to the northeast thus water from glaciers snow or rainfall in high mountains likely infiltrates vertically along the extension faults and circulates deeply to recharge geothermal groundwater the strontium isotope ratios of yr 0 7114 differ from those of deep geothermal water 0 7079 fig 9 thus yr does not infiltrate deep geothermal reservoirs but appears to provide a discharge mechanism in addition the 3h concentration of geothermal water varies from 5 54 to 6 57 tu tan et al 2014 measured 3h isotopes in 2012 and discovered that geothermal water in tibet generally shows higher values 2 72 20 tu that are unlikely to originate from radioactive decay and are likely due to atmospheric input most of the tritium produced by the atmospheric testing of thermonuclear bombs between 1951 and 1980 has been washed out from the atmosphere and tritium levels in global precipitation are now close to natural levels accordingly the tritium content in geothermal water decreased from approximately 20 tu in the 1980s to less than 5 tu today thus modern meteoric water can rapidly be discharged as geothermal water with a short residence time geothermal water at moderate to low temperatures generally exhibits positive oxygen isotopic shifts during water rock interaction for example geothermal water in xi an qin et al 2005 and tianjin china minissale et al 2008 has a low reservoir temperature but high positive oxygen isotope shift which suggests long residence time thus very large scale and high temperature geothermal abnormalities e g in the yangbajing geothermal field have developed in the tp where a logging campaign found temperatures 150 c duo 2005 surprisingly very slight water rock interactions during the deep circulation of the groundwater are indicated by the results therefore geothermal water circulates too rapidly to trigger stronger water rock interaction owing to the short residence times in the reservoir this explanation also accounts for the observation that many geothermal springs in the tp maintain a sustainable natural flow at high pressure for long periods 4 2 groundwater circulation mechanism the unique geological background of the tp determines the deep and shallow circulation modes of groundwater in the middle section of the yr fig 12 surface precipitation and meltwater from the source area of the nianchu river infiltrate along the thick glacial deposits or fluvial alluvial deposits in the unsaturated zone and recharge the phreatic groundwater and river water of the yr through subsurface currents the ew segment of the yr shows prominent deep circulation knickpoints in the river profile at locations where it crosses ns trending normal faults suggesting the strong influence of active faulting fig 2 deep faults in this region provide favorable conduits for vertical infiltration and deep circulation of high altitude recharge water tan et al 2014 the ydg and dxs faults which traverse the yr valley can reach 300 km in length and generally have widths and depths of 15 and 6 km respectively with quaternary alluvium and glacial till bases cogan et al 1998 su et al 2020 precipitation or meltwater produced at high elevations easily infiltrates vertically circulates at depth along such faults and eventually drains at the lowest altitudes of the yr driven by large topographical elevation changes 1000 m and the contrast in density between hot and cold water in short the deep and shallow circulation systems in the middle section of the yr substantially contribute to the rapid circulation and renewal of groundwater the maintenance of river flow in the dry season and the interannual stability of the river 4 3 possible climate change indications by annual stable isotopes in the yr global warming is expected to intensify the global hydrological system through a net transfer of freshwater from long term stores in ice and increased precipitation the tp is sensitive to climate change and the isotopic composition and spatiotemporal spatial dynamics of its groundwater level contain abundant climatic information since 2005 the groundwater level in rikaze has been increasing by 2014 the groundwater level in the whole region increased by an average of 1 3 m at an average rate of 0 01 m a table 4 the groundwater reserves in the qaidam basin in the northern tp also increased significantly from 2003 to 2012 jiao et al 2015 in addition residents of the gulu geothermal fields have observed that the naturally low fluxes of flowing geothermal geysers have increased these phenomena may be closely related to the intensification of precipitation over the past few decades the precipitation in rikaze increased significantly in the last 15 years at a rate of 11 36 mm a fig 10d owor et al 2009 suggested that intensified precipitation may promote groundwater recharge in addition the temperature in rikaze increased at a rate of approximately 0 05 c a in the past 15 years long term warming has caused the retreat of glacier and permafrost areas on the tp by 15 and 16 respectively over the past 50 years li et al 2020 degradation of permafrost increases the thickness of active layers provides increased storage for infiltrated precipitation and ice meltwater and may increase groundwater reserves in the alpine catchments of the andes 66 of dry season rio santa discharge originated from the glacierized tributaries and currently the dry season glacier melt contribution is increasing reflecting the fact that climate change does have a significant impact on the alpine catchment mark and mckenzie 2007 precipitation and groundwater are important components of the yr discharge cycle thus changes in precipitation and groundwater reserves affect the runoff and isotopic composition of river water as observed at rikaze station river runoff increased at a rate of 0 39 m3 s per year in the past 15 years fig 10d in fact not only the yr but also most alpine catchments showed a significant increase in annual runoff such as the glacial catchments of the andes which increased by 1 6 on average from 2004 to 2006 mark and mckenzie 2007 in addition a gradual depletion of stable isotopes was also observed in yr fig 10c during the wet season precipitation dominantly controls runoff and isotopic composition thus increasing precipitation is the principal mechanism of annual d and 18o isotope depletion precipitation during the dry season is low less than 10 of total annual precipitation from october to may and the baseflow is primarily maintained by groundwater thus the annual depletion trend of stable isotopes in the river reflects increased groundwater reserves overall annual runoff and isotopic changes of river water are primarily driven by changes in annual precipitation and are only weakly linked to changes in air temperature similarly li et al 2020 and zhang et al 2017 found that precipitation is the most significant factor for increased runoff and lake expansion on the tp therefore runoff and groundwater reserves are likely to increase in the coming decades with increased precipitation over the tp additionally enhanced drainage may increase flood risk and reduce ecosystem resiliency because of seasonal shifts in stream flow and groundwater abundance these changes will have profound effects on the local ecology and environment and on the water resource supply balance in asia 5 conclusion measurements of multiple hydrochemistry tds ph hydrochemical type and major ion concentrations and environmental isotope d o 3h and sr tracers were employed to investigate the seasonal river groundwater circulation in the middle reaches of the yr significant spatiotemporal variations in h and o isotopes and hydrochemistry along the yr were identified the ion concentration of the river water is high and isotopes are enriched in the dry season and depleted in the wet season river water in ms is particularly depleted in d and 18o isotopes due to the discharge of phreatic and deep circulation groundwater in the dry season in the wet season west east variations in the relative contribution of monsoon derived vs westerlies derived precipitation during runoff generation explains the depleted isotopic pattern of the river flow the mixing of multiple recharge end members is the dominant hydrological process along the river channel during the wet season precipitation contributing 31 0 3 6 and tributaries contributing 30 0 8 2 are the principal recharge end members for river water during the dry season groundwater maintains the baseflow with a contribution rate of 45 1 including the discharge of deep circulating groundwater contributing 19 6 9 9 in alpine mountainous regions e g the yr basin the phreatic groundwater system is primarily maintained by modern meltwater and precipitation originating from oceanic moisture and can be rapidly recharged through faults and fissures the groundwater seems to be very young less than 20 years old and recharges on a seasonal scale the deep circulating water represented by geothermal water infiltrates along the unsaturated zone or the north south orientated tensile fault belts that cut through the yr and may induce deep circulation before discharging to the yr under high head pressure moreover increased precipitation appears to be the principal contributor of depleting river water isotopes increasing runoff and groundwater levels on a multi year time scale followed by glacier mass loss therefore the hydrological cycle on the tp will intensify remarkably in the coming decades future research should focus on determining the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of precipitation runoff groundwater to assess the impacts of an

3958,alpine catchments are severely impacted by climate change and have been extensively studied from glaciological and hydrological perspectives however groundwater in such catchments is rarely mentioned and the role of the groundwater system in sustaining streamflow in alpine catchments remains unknown this study used an integrated framework with multi tracer data major ions and isotopes 2h 3h 18o and sr to identify seasonal water sources and to uncover the recharge discharge mechanism of the river groundwater system in the middle reaches of the yarlungzangbo river yr the results show that surface waters collected in the dry season major ions exhibit higher solute concentrations and stable isotopes h and o are more enriched in river water than in the wet season in addition river δ18o values exhibit a distinct spatial variation that decreases and then increases along the flow direction in the dry season but this is greatly attenuated during the wet season estimation results show that groundwater maintains the winter spring baseflow contributing 45 1 including the discharge of deep circulating groundwater through macro structures such as south north oriented active tensile faults contributing 19 6 9 9 during the wet season precipitation contributing 31 0 3 6 and tributaries contributing 30 0 8 2 are the principal recharge end members of the river water the rapid recharge of phreatic groundwater occurs in alpine regions through faults and fissures like the yr basin the phreatic groundwater system is primarily maintained by modern meltwater and precipitation originating from oceanic moisture the groundwater is younger than 20 years and recharges at a seasonal scale precipitation is likely the principal mechanism governing annual river flow and water level variations therefore groundwater storage and total runoff in the yr basin will increase greatly with climate warming in tibet simultaneously hydrological accidents are also likely to occur requiring advanced monitoring and prevention measures keywords river groundwater system isotopes spatiotemporal variability water circulation alpine catchment 1 introduction changes in temperature and precipitation patterns in the context of global climate change have a profound impact on regional ecosystems the water cycle and human activities pronounced warming and increasing precipitation trends in past decades have increased high temperature and heavy rainfall events observed at meteorological stations bahir et al 2020 chen and sun 2018 kang et al 2010 li et al 2019 gao et al 2019 the tibetan plateau tp the third pole of the world can influence the development and evolution of the global climate system and is sensitive to global climate change the mean annual temperature in the northeastern tp has increased by approximately 0 9 c over the past 30 years zhao et al 2004 the tp is also known as the water tower of asia with glacier and permafrost areas of 12 000 and 122 2 104 km2 respectively meltwater from the region ensures the perennial flow of major river systems in asia however numerous glaciers are shrinking particularly in the southeastern tp yao et al 2012a xiang et al 2016 and li et al 2014 attributed the rapid expansion of namco lake and the increased groundwater reserves in the eastern tp to accelerated glacier melt in addition recent literature reports accelerating rates of permafrost thaw which is expected to have cascading effects on the high latitude environment river flow regimes and associated biogeochemical interactions lu et al 2020 therefore quantifying the hydrological changes of alpine catchments and predicting future water resource changes are necessary an in depth understanding of how contemporary and future responses to environmental change affect the spatio temporal dynamics of runoff generation processes is a key step for answering these questions the yarlungzangbo river yr in the southern tp is the highest large river in the world and contributes abundant freshwater to the bay of bengal however the understanding of hydrological fluxes in the yr system and their response to basin specific characteristics remains limited due to a lack of systematic investigations and measurements water isotopes 18o 2h 3h and sr and hydrochemistry have a great potential for tracing climatological and hydrological processes and have been used extensively in water cycle research tian et al 2007 li and garzione 2017 li et al 2020 existing isotope hydrology studies primarily focus on precipitation formation mechanisms especially moisture sources and the topographical effect and the hydrologic dynamics of runoff in the central and eastern parts of the yr for instance the isotopic composition of precipitation in the eastern yr basin exhibits a profound altitude effect primarily due to the orographic lifting and adiabatic cooling of monsoonal moisture in summer hren et al 2009 gao et al 2010 ren et al 2017 tian et al 2020 ren et al 2018 documented the changing isotope composition in summer flow along the principal stream of the yr δ18o values decreased from the headwaters to the middle reaches but increased from the middle to lower reaches this is because oceanic moisture is transported from the south which significantly depletes isotopes ren et al 2016 ren et al 2018 tian et al 2001 cuo et al 2014 systematically reviewed surface runoff characteristics including yr water in the tp and provided a preliminary prediction of future trends in the context of global warming the study also indicated that ice snow meltwater is an important water source in alpine regions on the edge of the tp due to the limitations of natural conditions and current research the impact of groundwater on rivers is rarely considered and the effect of groundwater on the glaciated catchments that feed most rivers on the tp is unknown in addition previous studies generally paid more attention to summer rivers and ignored the completely different water source partitioning in the dry and wet seasons of large rivers in alpine catchments e g the yr or simply considered the hydrological process and ignored the tectonic background of the study area these omissions significantly limit the evaluation of present and future water resources we recently analyzed yr monitoring data in the dry season and provided preliminary insights into the role of groundwater in alpine catchments tan et al 2021 however due to limited data and a shortage of wet season samples annual water source partitioning and the mechanisms governing the seasonal recharge discharge of the river groundwater system in the yr catchment remain unclear therefore analyzing the interconnection and dynamics of regional aquifers and river water in the context of global climate change provides a new perspective for understanding the water cycle in the alpine catchment and a basic reference for avoiding an imbalance between the supply and demand of water resources in coming decades in this study the so called one river two tributaries area in the middle reaches of the yr was selected as the study area and the dry and wet seasons were selected as the study periods the hydrological cycle of the alpine catchment was modeled by stable h o and sr isotopes radioactive 3h isotopes and hydrochemical methods the principal objectives of this study were 1 to provide clear hydrogeochemical and isotopic evidence for surface groundwater seasonal recharge sources in the yr basin 2 to estimate the contribution of various potential recharge end members to river flow in different seasons and 3 to explore the climate response characteristics of rivers for predicting future water resource trends in the basin the technical novelties of this study are the integration of isotope hydrochemistry with tectonic geology and the use of key tracer technologies with multi index coupling to track hydrological circulation processes scientific achievements include understanding water source partitioning on a seasonal scale in an alpine catchment and revealing the potential impact of groundwater on river discharge in the dry and wet seasons 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yr is a typical large river draining the high altitude cold area of the tp the basin is controlled by westerlies from october to may and precipitation is rare after mid june the warm moist air masses from the bay of bengal are blocked by the himalayas and move upward along the yr valley bringing precipitation to the southern part of the tp hren et al 2009 tian et al 2007 yao et al 2012b the study area is the one river two tributaries area of the yr which refers to the area along the principal river from lazi to yangcun and two major tributaries the nianchu river rising on the northern slope of the himalayas and the lhasa river rising from the nyainqntanglha mountains fig 1 this region is the most important and richest agricultural area in the tibet autonomous region the scale of human activity is large and the consumption and utilization rates of water resources are high the recharge and circulation of river groundwater largely determine the hydrological process of the entire yr this study uses isotope variations tectonics and physiography to divide the study area into the western section ws middle section ms and eastern section es fig 1c the ws ms and es extend over 86 88 e 88 91 e the area affected by the fault zone and 91 93 e respectively the tp began to be uplifted in 55 50 ma because of the india asia collision ongoing n s convergence between india and asia has resulted in a series of large scale strike slip faults and sutures distributed around the terrane boundaries harrison et al 1992 kapp et al 2005 the modern yr flows along the suture from west to east and bends to the south cutting a deep gorge through the himalayas tan et al 2020 nearly n s trending grabens and rifts developed in en echelon arrays terminate in strike slip faults at the center of the plateau and the southern flank of the himalayas fig 2 the rifts which can be up to 300 km long and 15 km wide are potential conduits for the deep circulation of meltwater into high mountains su et al 2020 in each fault zone groundwater discharge through hot springs likely occurs at the lowest topographic point which is at the intersection with the yr tan et al 2014 the dingjie xietongmen shenzha dxs and yadong dangxiong gulu ydg faults intersect at the middle reaches of the yr and are the two largest transverse rift zones in the basin many geothermal springs e g in the guoqiong chabu molong and yangbajin geothermal fields near the dxs and ydg faults discharge into the yr valley within the yr drainage basin rocks exposed to the north of the yr are primarily cretaceous to cenozoic granitoids of the gangdese batholith and the linzizong volcanic successions with local quaternary sediments of various origins to the south the tributaries drain paleozoic mesozoic tethyan himalayan strata pan et al 2004 2 2 sampling and measurements field observations and sampling were conducted in early may 2018 2019 and early september 2018 fig 1 because the yr is in an alpine region early may is characterized by the end of the dry season before the onset of large scale ice and snow melt and monsoon precipitation early september is characterized by the end of the wet season the basin was fully replenished by precipitation in july and august and re adjusted in september to avoid the impact of heavy rainfall events on rivers and groundwater samples for analysis of 2h 3h o and sr isotopes and major ions were collected as follows 1 precipitation samples for h and o isotopes were collected from a rain gauge at weather stations in rikaze and lhasa from 2017 to 2019 table s1 2 river water was collected along the yr nianchu and lhasa rivers samples were taken at least 1 m away from the riverbank using a stainless steel collector tables s2 and s3 3 groundwater was primarily sampled from civil wells some samples were from monitoring wells in the yr basin table s4 shows the basic hydrological information water from monitoring wells was collected using a stainless steel sampler 1 m below the water surface water from civil wells was collected through extraction by a bore hole turbine pump 4 geothermal water was sampled from hot springs near the dxs and ydg faults at the time of sampling the electrical conductivity ph and temperature were measured in the field using standard hand held calibrated field meters measurements of stable h and o isotopes and major ions were performed at the state key laboratory of hydrology water resources and hydraulic engineering hohai university china the 2h 1h and 18o 16o ratios were measured on a mat253 mass spectrometer the results were reported relative to vsmow with an analytical precision 1σ of 1 2 and 0 2 0 3 respectively cation concentrations were measured by icp aes with 5 0 error and anion concentrations were measured by ion chromatography with 2 0 error alkalinity as hco3 was analyzed by titration in the field using the gran method wetzel and likens 2000 with 2 0 uncertainty compared with the standard nahco3 sr isotopic analysis was performed on a vg 354 mass spectrometer with five collectors at the center of modern analysis nanjing university isotopic results were reported with a margin of error of 0 000009 for 87sr 86sr to determine the tritium 3h content the water samples were concentrated through electrolysis and measured by low background liquid scintillation counting tri carb 3170 tr sl the results were expressed as absolute concentrations using tritium units tu after sample enrichment the precision was improved to more than 0 8 tu tables s1 s3 present field records isotope data and chemical compositions respectively 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 hydrograph separation hooper et al 1990 and hooper 2003 introduced an end member mixing analysis emma method using chemical isotopic compositions of water the changing composition of water can be considered to result from intersections during its passage through different landscapes the calculations are expressed as follows 1 1 i 1 n f i c m j i 1 n f i c i j j 1 k where fi denotes the proportion of water source i and n refers to the number of end members c m j denotes the tracer j incorporated in component i for more than three end members the isosource model is an effective tool for calculating the contribution ratios phillips and gregg 2003 in this study δ18o and δd data were used in the model because they have a wide range of values and are almost uninfluenced by water rock interactions during runoff processes frauke et al 2011 the model was executed with a fractional increment of 1 and an uncertainty level of 0 1 2 3 2 hydrograph separation uncertainty the uncertainty of tracer based hydrograph separations was calculated using the error propagation technique which considers the errors of all the separation equation variables assuming that the contribution of a specific streamflow component to streamflow is a function of several variables c1 c2 cn and that the uncertainty of each variable is independent of the uncertainty of others the relative error δf of the target variable f is related to the uncertainty in all variables as following li et al 2020 2 δ f 1 f f c 1 δ c 1 2 f c 2 δ c 2 2 f c n δ c n 2 where δci i 1 n represents the uncertainty of the corresponding ci 1 n in this study the standard deviation was defined as the uncertainty δci of the variable specified by the subscript the software package matlab was used to apply eq 1 for the hydrograph separation in this study 2 3 3 radioactive decay of tritium isotopes tritium is an effective tracer for studying groundwater age and recharge renewal in the yr basin groundwater is quickly recharged by rainfall infiltration and provides aquifer water with isotopic values almost the same as those of the atmosphere in an idealized state groundwater is recharged by precipitation in the piedmont alluvial fan and movement is driven by piston flow the decay of 3h is only a function of time

constant of 3h λ 0 055764 2 3 4 recharge elevation the δ18o and δd values of precipitation decrease as elevation increases this elevation effect is often used to determine the infiltration height of

dissolved solids tds and major ion concentrations of river water are generally higher in the dry season than in the wet season because of the dilution of river water by heavy summer precipitation as well as the higher evaporation rate in dry season with almost no precipitation dilution figs 3 and 4 in the dry season tds is higher in the ms 156 81 mg l than in the ws 105 40 mg l es 95 56 mg l and tributary of lhasa river 95 56 mg l but markedly lower than in the nianchu river 203 15 mg l and geothermal water 1191 52 mg l table 1 major ion concentrations show similar characteristics and a significant peak in na 78 13 mg l cl 65 70 mg l and so4 2 57 06 mg l in the ms in the wet season the tds and ion concentration of the river water decrease slightly along the flow direction tds 99 66 mg l and ion concentration in the ms are similar to those in phreatic groundwater 94 64 mg l ca2 and na are dominant ions in the dry season and ca2 and mg2 are dominant in the wet season in the yr the water chemical types vary from hco3 so4 ca and hco3 cl na in may to hco3 ca mg in september the anomalous water chemistry of the river water near the dxs and ydg fault zones hco3 cl na is similar to that of geothermal water fig 5 the principal water chemistry types of phreatic groundwater are dominated by hco3 ca mg and hco3 so4 ca with minor seasonal changes geothermal water is characterized by cl na cl hco3 na and hco3 cl na types owing to long term hydrochemical evolution 3 2 stable h and o isotopes of different water bodies the δ18o and δd values of winter spring precipitation range from 17 86 to 5 44 and 132 3 to 45 76 with weighted mean values of 13 11 and 91 78 respectively the isotopes are significantly depleted in summer precipitation with δ18o and δd values from 31 49 to 14 54 and 210 0 to 110 5 with weighted averages of 23 40 and 175 1 respectively table 1 the δ18o δd plot of precipitation shows a significant linear correlation δd 7 19δ18o 4 44 r2 0 95 n 98 which can be used to represent the information of the local meteoric water line lmwl within a hydrological year fig 6 most samples of different water bodies river and groundwater fall on or near the lmwl indicating that the water samples did not undergo significant evaporation or other fractionation effects during precipitation infiltration or inflow into streams the stable h and o isotopes of the main river in the middle reaches of the yr also exhibit significant temporal and spatial variabilities with enrichment and depletion during the dry and wet seasons respectively fig 7 the δ18o and δd values of the river water in the dry season ranged from 18 26 to 15 79 and 140 3 to 118 8 whereas those in the wet season ranged from 22 18 to 20 34 and 159 1 to 147 4 respectively table 1 the tributaries showed similar seasonal variations the average δ18o and δd values of the nianchu and lhasa rivers were from 16 11 to 120 1 and 16 73 to 123 5 may and 18 11 to 134 7 and 18 50 to 133 9 september respectively stable isotopes of the ws and two major recharge tributaries the lhasa and nianchu rivers were significantly spatially enriched the lowest values of δ18o and δd appeared in the ms and es during the dry and wet seasons respectively fig 7 the δ18o and δd in phreatic groundwater varied from 21 16 to 16 99 and 157 5 to 128 4 respectively demonstrating a close seasonal response to river water table 1 and figs 6 and 7 the surface water and groundwater in the yr basin are controlled by seasonal recharge sources which are unique among groundwater recharge systems in arid and semi arid zones the geothermal water was collected only in may the δ18o and δd were distributed from 21 51 to 17 51 and 166 8 to 142 0 respectively which is close to the variation range of groundwater in the wet season 3 3 tritium and strontium isotopes the spatial variation of 3h isotopes in the water samples also reflects the hydraulic relationship between different water bodies fig 8 the 3h value of the yr gradually decreases from lazi to the estuary of the lhasa river with a range of 7 98 10 68 tu the mean value is close to that of phreatic groundwater significant characteristics were noted first the 3h value of the river water in the rikaze wetland drops sharply second the 3h value of the river water in the ygd fault is lower than that of phreatic groundwater the sr isotopes in the main river do not have substantial spatial variations with a range of 0 71049 0 71194 average value of 0 71136 which is significantly lower than the average value in nianchu river 0 71490 table s3 the lhasa river has a relatively low sr isotope ratio avg 0 71037 and a relatively high sr concentration avg 0 715 mg l fig 9 the 87sr 86sr value in phreatic groundwater is close to that of the main river with a small range of 0 70928 0 71312 the sr isotopic ratio of most geothermal water approximately 0 708 is close to the range of marine carbonates the lowest observed value 0 704 is close to the range of mantle derived magma or late crystallized granite 4 discussion 4 1 recharge sources 4 1 1 source of precipitation moisture precipitation in the yr basin exhibits significant spatiotemporal variations the multi year temperature and precipitation records of weather stations in rikaze and lhasa show that the dry season generally spans from late september october to the end of april early may of the following year no large scale melting of snow glaciers or heavy precipitation events occur during this period which only featured sporadic light rain or snowfall fig 10 a and b the river and groundwater level declined and maintained a low flow rate the wet season occurs during late may september precipitation of 420 1 and 497 6 mm accounting for 92 1 and 87 6 of annual precipitation occur in rikaze and lhasa respectively the temperature fluctuates with monthly precipitation the highest temperature of 17 6 c was recorded in june 2019 this typical plateau monsoon climate is wet in summer due to the influence of ocean currents and dry and cold in winter due to internal continental circulation the h and o isotopes also show substantial seasonal variations in precipitation the δ18o value of precipitation in the winter spring is higher than that during the monsoon period fig 6 the d excess is widely used to track the moisture source of precipitation in general precipitation derived from marine moisture evaporated under humid conditions has relatively low d excess whereas that derived from recycled moisture evaporated under low humidity has relatively high d excess ren et al 2017 the weighted average of the d excess of precipitation in the yr is higher in winter spring and lower in summer table s1 therefore summer precipitation primarily originates from marine moisture and is significantly affected by the southwest indian ocean monsoon the relatively high δ18o and d excess in the dry season reflect moisture circulation on the plateau moisture from the westerly belt has particularly high d excess values in the δ18o δd plot fig 6 the isotopic range of precipitation covers that of river water groundwater and glacial meltwater the aggregation towards the end member of monsoon precipitation indicates that winter spring precipitation has a weak impact on the hydrological process of the basin 4 1 2 river water recharge source the seasonal differences in river water isotopes are significant especially in 2018 fig 10c all data quoted in the figure are from yr river water samples close to the collection site of river water samples in this study see table s5 for specific data and reference information from the dry season to the wet season the average δ18o varies by 20 this fluctuation is not common in other major rivers in china such as the yangtze wu et al 2018 and heihe yang et al 2011 the summer precipitation in 2018 was the highest in recent decades and the total precipitation from june to september in rikaze was 36 1 higher than the average precipitation over the past 15 years 433 5 mm fig 10d additionally the positive correlation between the seasonal variation of isotopes and precipitation reflects the dependence of the river water isotopes on summer precipitation in addition the spatial variations of isotopes in different seasons show different trends implying a difference in water sources and hydrological processes in the dry and wet seasons the dry season values of δ18o and δd near the dxs and ydg faults ms were significantly lower than those in the ws es and tributaries fig 7 the isotope characteristics after the upstream inflow ws mixed with the tributary of the nianchu river should have been significantly enriched rather than depleted indicating that other end member mixed with a depleted isotopic source to maintain the significantly negative isotope pattern in the middle section of the yr in the middle reaches of the yr the isotopes δ18o δd of river water and groundwater show similar seasonal responses figs 6 and 7 reflecting the hydraulic connection between surface water and groundwater in the dry season the concentration of radioactive 3h in the river water decreases significantly in the rikaze wetland indicating the discharge of phreatic groundwater from the rikaze wetland to the yr fig 8 the contribution of phreatic groundwater to runoff in dry season has also been mentioned in other alpine catchments such as the alps where groundwater flow contribution does play an important role in rock glacier spring discharge especially during the winter months or periods of little recharge wagner et al 2021 in addition deep circulating groundwater is another potential source of river water andermann et al 2012 and remains in aquifers for a relatively long time hco3 cl na type water forms after a long period of evolution and appears in the winter spring base water fig 5 the tds and ion concentrations of river water increase in the ms the concentrations of na and cl increase significantly near the fault zone reflecting the substantial discharge of deep circulating groundwater in the ms of the yr figs 3 and 4 overall the recharge source of the river water in the dry season is upstream inflow tributaries and the discharge of deep and phreatic groundwater emma and the calculated uncertainty revealed the contribution rates and uncertainty of each end member table 2 the results show that groundwater plays an important role in maintaining the winter spring baseflow with a contribution rate of 45 1 whereof deep circulating groundwater accounts for 19 6 9 9 the uncertainty is 0 309 most of the uncertainty in this study is attributed to variations in and differences among tracer concentrations for runoff components despite the uncertainties isotope based hydrograph separation remains to be a valuable tool for evaluating the contribution of groundwater to rivers and is particularly helpful for improving our understanding of hydrological processes in cold regions that lack observational data in the wet season river waters from the ws of the yr have the highest δ18o river waters from the es have the lowest δ18o fig 7 from the ws to the es water first progressively deviates from the lmwl and then progressively approaches or exceeds the lmwl fig 6 from a climatological perspective the hydrological process of the basin is influenced by the monsoon system in the east and the westerly system in the west fig 1a ren et al 2017 monsoon derived precipitation is characterized by low δ18o and d excess whereas westerly derived precipitation is characterized by high δ18o and d excess previous isotopic studies have revealed specific controls on precipitation in the southern tp hren et al 2009 ren et al 2016 ren et al 2018 kong et al 2019 the ms is in the transitional zone between the westerlies and monsoon derived water vapor from the ocean the increasing influence of the westerlies towards the eastern ms and the decreasing influence of the monsoon toward the western ms largely explain the westward increase in the δ18o of the surface waters fig 7 however the significantly depleted trend of isotopes in the ms relative to those in the lower reaches in the dry season do not appear in the wet season primarily because the contribution of heavy summer precipitation with relatively enriched isotopes is much larger than that of other sources the gradual depletion of isotopes along the summer runoff direction is attributed to spatial differences in moist air masses in the δ18o δd plot fig 6 the river water samples in september fall on an end member that is more depleted than meltwater phreatic groundwater and even geothermal water therefore summer precipitation is the principal source of the river in the wet season groundwater and other sources are also important components of river water 87sr 86sr 1 sr plot fig 9 which indicates the mixed recharge by other potential end members in the wet season the entire river system can be expressed as the result of the weathering of the two end members the first end member represented by geothermal water has a notably high sr content and a low sr isotopic ratio most sr isotopes are close to 0 708 suggesting the weathering of carbonate rocks the lower sr isotopic ratios of a few samples especially those approximately equal to 0 705 are related to mantle derived fluids or water rock interactions e g granites in deep high temperature environments the second end member originates from the weathering of silicate surface rocks and is represented by the nianchu river which has a low sr content and a high sr isotope ratio the sr isotope ratio in the middle reaches of the yr is higher than that produced by carbonate rock weathering but lower than that produced by silicate rock weathering possibly due to the weathering of different rocks and the input of different end members the isosource model results showed that the contribution rate of precipitation was 31 0 3 6 with an uncertainly of 0 316 the proportion of groundwater was lower at 25 3 8 7 table 2 there was abundant summer precipitation in 2018 which was the greatest in recent decades therefore the estimated ratio may represent an extreme situation however the contribution of recharge end members in the wet and dry seasons in the yr varies greatly and is the primary reason for seasonal differences in river water isotopes 4 1 3 recharge source of groundwater groundwater recharge in arid basins or catchments is generally relatively slow and isotopic changes on a seasonal scale tend to be weakened or homogenized during recharge for example the groundwater in the north china plain and the ordos basin was recharged during the geological period and the seasonal effect of isotopes cannot be identified chen et al 2011 ma et al 2018 however the stable isotopic composition of the phreatic groundwater in the yr is quite different in the dry and wet seasons with an average difference of 11 2 this reflects seasonal recharge sources and hydrogeological characteristics of rapid groundwater circulation tritium is an important indicator for determining the age and renewal rate of groundwater the 3h concentration is generally only a function of time during the precipitation recharge and transport processes of groundwater if the 3h concentration of a phreatic groundwater sample 8 27 tu is known the 3h concentration curve of the groundwater before 2018 can be obtained according to eq 3 that is y 8 27 e 0 055764 2018 x the precipitation 3h concentration curve of the tp and its adjacent study area were plotted fig 11 for lhasa kunming urumqi xindeli and ottawa iaea wmo iaea wmo 2019 this curve and inversion curve of precipitation 3h in adjacent areas intersect at approximately 1990 and the precipitation 3h content of approximately 50 tu is much higher than that in lhasa during the same period if the 3h concentration in the precipitation in lhasa is taken as the background value the inversion curve of groundwater decay intersects after 2000 therefore the 3h age of phreatic groundwater in yr is approximately 0 20 years indicating a relatively fast renewal rate in general significant changes in h and o isotopes are not visible in groundwater at least the interannual scale research shows that less than 6 of the world s modern groundwater recharge gleeson et al 2016 which means modern recharge is generally rarely happened why can groundwater of the yr achieve rapid circulation and renewal rate even seasonal recharge in some areas can be identified this may be closely related to the seasonal variation of supply sources during the dry season precipitation intensity is low and the proportion of vertical infiltration to aquifer recharge is low the δ18o δd and 3h values of phreatic groundwater are very close to those of the meltwater of karola glacier figs 6 and 9 therefore high altitude glacial meltwater may be the principal source of groundwater in the dry season glacial meltwater maintains baseflow or supplies main recharge source these hydrological scenarios have also been observed in other alpine regions such as alps pyrenees and andes where high altitude meltwater provides a rich source of groundwater brown et al 2006 wagner et al 2021 liaudat et al 2020 according to the calculation of groundwater recharge elevation the average recharge elevation of phreatic groundwater of the yr at approximately 5385 m table 3 is close to that of the karola mountains thus glacial meltwater from the source area of the nianchu river infiltrates along the thick glacial or fluvial deposits in the unsaturated zone and recharges the phreatic groundwater in the middle reaches of the yr in the wet season the h and o isotopes of phreatic groundwater are more depleted than in the dry season indicating that summer precipitation contributes a large proportion of infiltrated groundwater recharge field work showed that the groundwater level rose significantly in september and flooded the main road from lhasa to rikaze the dynamic change of the groundwater level was basically consistent with that of the river water further proving the strong influence of summer precipitation on groundwater the outlet temperature of geothermal water in hot springs is generally higher than 30 c and can exceed the local boiling point 80 c the water is heated at depth and is ejected at a high temperature and pressure on the δ18o δd plot fig 6 most geothermal water sample points fall near the lmwl indicating that geothermal water also originates from local precipitation however the recharge source of geothermal water is different from that of the rivers and should be more depleted in d and 18o isotopes because all geothermal water samples plot to the right below the river and groundwater therefore geothermal water sources may be located at a higher elevation than the recharge source of the river phreatic groundwater this is also indicated by the average recharge elevation of geothermal water 6111 m table 3 which is close to that of the surrounding mountains peaks approximately 6000 m for the himalayan mountains to the south and 5500 6000 m for the tanglha mountains to the northeast thus water from glaciers snow or rainfall in high mountains likely infiltrates vertically along the extension faults and circulates deeply to recharge geothermal groundwater the strontium isotope ratios of yr 0 7114 differ from those of deep geothermal water 0 7079 fig 9 thus yr does not infiltrate deep geothermal reservoirs but appears to provide a discharge mechanism in addition the 3h concentration of geothermal water varies from 5 54 to 6 57 tu tan et al 2014 measured 3h isotopes in 2012 and discovered that geothermal water in tibet generally shows higher values 2 72 20 tu that are unlikely to originate from radioactive decay and are likely due to atmospheric input most of the tritium produced by the atmospheric testing of thermonuclear bombs between 1951 and 1980 has been washed out from the atmosphere and tritium levels in global precipitation are now close to natural levels accordingly the tritium content in geothermal water decreased from approximately 20 tu in the 1980s to less than 5 tu today thus modern meteoric water can rapidly be discharged as geothermal water with a short residence time geothermal water at moderate to low temperatures generally exhibits positive oxygen isotopic shifts during water rock interaction for example geothermal water in xi an qin et al 2005 and tianjin china minissale et al 2008 has a low reservoir temperature but high positive oxygen isotope shift which suggests long residence time thus very large scale and high temperature geothermal abnormalities e g in the yangbajing geothermal field have developed in the tp where a logging campaign found temperatures 150 c duo 2005 surprisingly very slight water rock interactions during the deep circulation of the groundwater are indicated by the results therefore geothermal water circulates too rapidly to trigger stronger water rock interaction owing to the short residence times in the reservoir this explanation also accounts for the observation that many geothermal springs in the tp maintain a sustainable natural flow at high pressure for long periods 4 2 groundwater circulation mechanism the unique geological background of the tp determines the deep and shallow circulation modes of groundwater in the middle section of the yr fig 12 surface precipitation and meltwater from the source area of the nianchu river infiltrate along the thick glacial deposits or fluvial alluvial deposits in the unsaturated zone and recharge the phreatic groundwater and river water of the yr through subsurface currents the ew segment of the yr shows prominent deep circulation knickpoints in the river profile at locations where it crosses ns trending normal faults suggesting the strong influence of active faulting fig 2 deep faults in this region provide favorable conduits for vertical infiltration and deep circulation of high altitude recharge water tan et al 2014 the ydg and dxs faults which traverse the yr valley can reach 300 km in length and generally have widths and depths of 15 and 6 km respectively with quaternary alluvium and glacial till bases cogan et al 1998 su et al 2020 precipitation or meltwater produced at high elevations easily infiltrates vertically circulates at depth along such faults and eventually drains at the lowest altitudes of the yr driven by large topographical elevation changes 1000 m and the contrast in density between hot and cold water in short the deep and shallow circulation systems in the middle section of the yr substantially contribute to the rapid circulation and renewal of groundwater the maintenance of river flow in the dry season and the interannual stability of the river 4 3 possible climate change indications by annual stable isotopes in the yr global warming is expected to intensify the global hydrological system through a net transfer of freshwater from long term stores in ice and increased precipitation the tp is sensitive to climate change and the isotopic composition and spatiotemporal spatial dynamics of its groundwater level contain abundant climatic information since 2005 the groundwater level in rikaze has been increasing by 2014 the groundwater level in the whole region increased by an average of 1 3 m at an average rate of 0 01 m a table 4 the groundwater reserves in the qaidam basin in the northern tp also increased significantly from 2003 to 2012 jiao et al 2015 in addition residents of the gulu geothermal fields have observed that the naturally low fluxes of flowing geothermal geysers have increased these phenomena may be closely related to the intensification of precipitation over the past few decades the precipitation in rikaze increased significantly in the last 15 years at a rate of 11 36 mm a fig 10d owor et al 2009 suggested that intensified precipitation may promote groundwater recharge in addition the temperature in rikaze increased at a rate of approximately 0 05 c a in the past 15 years long term warming has caused the retreat of glacier and permafrost areas on the tp by 15 and 16 respectively over the past 50 years li et al 2020 degradation of permafrost increases the thickness of active layers provides increased storage for infiltrated precipitation and ice meltwater and may increase groundwater reserves in the alpine catchments of the andes 66 of dry season rio santa discharge originated from the glacierized tributaries and currently the dry season glacier melt contribution is increasing reflecting the fact that climate change does have a significant impact on the alpine catchment mark and mckenzie 2007 precipitation and groundwater are important components of the yr discharge cycle thus changes in precipitation and groundwater reserves affect the runoff and isotopic composition of river water as observed at rikaze station river runoff increased at a rate of 0 39 m3 s per year in the past 15 years fig 10d in fact not only the yr but also most alpine catchments showed a significant increase in annual runoff such as the glacial catchments of the andes which increased by 1 6 on average from 2004 to 2006 mark and mckenzie 2007 in addition a gradual depletion of stable isotopes was also observed in yr fig 10c during the wet season precipitation dominantly controls runoff and isotopic composition thus increasing precipitation is the principal mechanism of annual d and 18o isotope depletion precipitation during the dry season is low less than 10 of total annual precipitation from october to may and the baseflow is primarily maintained by groundwater thus the annual depletion trend of stable isotopes in the river reflects increased groundwater reserves overall annual runoff and isotopic changes of river water are primarily driven by changes in annual precipitation and are only weakly linked to changes in air temperature similarly li et al 2020 and zhang et al 2017 found that precipitation is the most significant factor for increased runoff and lake expansion on the tp therefore runoff and groundwater reserves are likely to increase in the coming decades with increased precipitation over the tp additionally enhanced drainage may increase flood risk and reduce ecosystem resiliency because of seasonal shifts in stream flow and groundwater abundance these changes will have profound effects on the local ecology and environment and on the water resource supply balance in asia 5 conclusion measurements of multiple hydrochemistry tds ph hydrochemical type and major ion concentrations and environmental isotope d o 3h and sr tracers were employed to investigate the seasonal river groundwater circulation in the middle reaches of the yr significant spatiotemporal variations in h and o isotopes and hydrochemistry along the yr were identified the ion concentration of the river water is high and isotopes are enriched in the dry season and depleted in the wet season river water in ms is particularly depleted in d and 18o isotopes due to the discharge of phreatic and deep circulation groundwater in the dry season in the wet season west east variations in the relative contribution of monsoon derived vs westerlies derived precipitation during runoff generation explains the depleted isotopic pattern of the river flow the mixing of multiple recharge end members is the dominant hydrological process along the river channel during the wet season precipitation contributing 31 0 3 6 and tributaries contributing 30 0 8 2 are the principal recharge end members for river water during the dry season groundwater maintains the baseflow with a contribution rate of 45 1 including the discharge of deep circulating groundwater contributing 19 6 9 9 in alpine mountainous regions e g the yr basin the phreatic groundwater system is primarily maintained by modern meltwater and precipitation originating from oceanic moisture and can be rapidly recharged through faults and fissures the groundwater seems to be very young less than 20 years old and recharges on a seasonal scale the deep circulating water represented by geothermal water infiltrates along the unsaturated zone or the north south orientated tensile fault belts that cut through the yr and may induce deep circulation before discharging to the yr under high head pressure moreover increased precipitation appears to be the principal contributor of depleting river water isotopes increasing runoff and groundwater levels on a multi year time scale followed by glacier mass loss therefore the hydrological cycle on the tp will intensify remarkably in the coming decades future research should focus on determining the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of precipitation runoff groundwater to assess the impacts of an

3959,aquitards can preserve paleo saltwater and have a long and profound influence on the aquifer groundwater yet they have received less attention here five one dimensional vertical profiles of the natural tracers cl br δ2h and δ18o of aquitard porewater were measured and combined with eight existing profiles collected from previous studies in three eastern china coastal plains bohai bay laizhou bay and jiangsu coastal plain to show the salinity origin and the timescale of the transport of porewater across aquitards since the mid holocene evidence of paleo seawater impacted by holocene transgression is noticed as peak cl concentration enriched water isotopes and lower cl br ratios are observed in the porewater at about the bottom depth of holocene of 25 m the shape of cl profiles and associated 1 d transport models confirms holocene seawater s presence in the sediment and the alternating transgression and regression control the salinity evolution of coastal aquitard porewater diffusion is the dominant transport across aquitard with an upward velocity between 0 03 and 0 6 mm yr reverse advective flow has affected the solute transport in areas of extensive pumping anthropogenic activities enhance the leaching of salty porewater into aquifers in coastal areas necessitating the need for research focused on marine aquitard salty water keywords porewater aquitard salinization coastal plain china 1 introduction groundwater constitutes a significant proportion of the water resources in the densely populated coastal regions but is frequently salty or brackish numerous studies have characterized groundwater salinization regimes abu alnaeem et al 2018 han et al 2011 han et al 2015 jiao et al 2010 li et al 2017a van engelen et al 2018 processes resulting in high salinity groundwater in coastal aquifers include recent natural or pumped induced seawater or saltwater intrusion han et al 2015 evaporation or dissolution of marine evaporite wang and jiao 2012 a complex salinization process is encountered in the coastal area that is groundwater salinization during multiple transgressions or by the diffusion of connate seawater trapped in clay rich aquitard han et al 2020 larsen et al 2017 wang et al 2013 transgression and regression cycles are prevailing during the quaternary period yi et al 2012 which may affect groundwater salinity on a geological time scale ascertaining the origin of paleo salinity and spatial distribution related to the geological history is crucial for the effective management of the available water resources in the coastal regions many studies on european african and australian coastal aquifer systems found that paleo seawater was still present in holocene aged sediments and leached salinity into aquifers post et al 2003 manzano et al 2001 sivan et al 2005 harrington et al 2013 significant correlation between the chloride concentrations in aquitard porewater and groundwater in the aquifer further indicated the strong influence of the aquitard on aquifer salinity wang et al 2013 thick layers of aquitard comprised of clayey soils are widespread along the china muddy coast 4000 km including bohai bay laizhou bay and jiangsu coastal area han et al 1996 provided connate seawater occurred widely in the coastal aquitard it may become the main salinity source instead of modern seawater however few studies in the china coastal regions have shown the ability of aquitard to preserve paleo seawater related to historical transgressions exceptions include profiles of aquitard porewater in bohai bay jiangsu coastal plain and the pearl river delta which focused on the geochemical signatures salinity origin major ions and trace elements variations and water rock interactions in the porewater wang et al 2013 li et al 2013 li et al 2015 li et al 2017a li et al 2017b ge et al 2017 various salinity vertical profiles from literature boreholes were observed which were resulted from different hydrological processes while the timescales of aquitard porewater transport process associated with paleo hydrological evolution and the hydraulic connections with aquifers are poorly understood diffusion is expected to be the dominant transport mechanism in low permeability aquitard xie et al 2011 2015 chen et al 2009 and the residence time of porewater can be up to thousands to millions of years al et al 2015 bensenouci et al 2014 natural tracer profiles such as cl br h o isotopes and helium 4 of aquitard porewater and associated transport simulation can give significant insights for long time climatic and geologic shifts and paleo infiltration of aquifer system hendry et al 2013 waber et al 2012 gardner et al 2012 hendry and harrington 2014 priestley et al 2018 in china coastal plain only two porewater transport simulation works interpreted the salinity profile han et al 2020 and ge et al 2017 conducted a one dimensional simulation of porewater transport in aquitard since 260 ka bp and 24 ka bp respectively involving several times transgression and regression events yet without consideration of the influence of coastal aquifer over extraction or the rate of sedimentation much more studies are needed to figure out the complex mechanism of salinity evolution in aquitard porewater in this paper aquitard samples were collected from five deep boreholes along the coastal regions of eastern china fig 1 natural tracer 2h 18o cl br profiles of porewater were measured to identify the salinity evolution related to holocene transgression and regression events these profiles were also compared to eight existing profiles at the adjacent areas li et al 2013 2015 2017a li et al 2017b ge et al 2017 porewater transport processes were simulated using a 1 d model to evaluate the porewater transport timescales through the aquitard this study will enhance the understanding of the salinization and freshening processes of coastal aquitard porewater in quaternary coastal plain worldwide 2 background of the study area 2 1 hydrogeology the studied area is located in the china eastern coastal plain including the coastal regions of bohai sea and yellow sea fig 1 the coastal plain of bohai sea i e bohai bay and laizhou bay has a sub humid monsoon climate with an average air temperature of 10 12 the average annual precipitation is 600 700 mm and the evapotranspiration is 1900 2400 mm han et al 2014 li et al 2017a the coastal region of yellow sea i e jiangsu coastal plain is relatively warmer and wetter it has an average air temperature of 13 15 and the average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration is 1050 and 877 mm respectively kang 2017 elevation of the coastal plain is relatively low about 30 50 m a s l in bohai sea area 3 9 m a s l in jiangsu area with an average slope of 0 3 0 5 toward the sea the main river systems distributed in the plain from north to south are luanhe river haihe river yellow river huaihe river and yangtze river and a river delta was formed in the area where it entered the sea quaternary sediments range in thickness from 200 to 350 m in the western bohai bay 50 400 m in the laizhou bay and 100 to 370 m in the jiangsu coastal plain han et al 1996 kang 2017 overall from the delta front to sea sediment grain size changes from coarse to fine in profile sediment in the early and middle pleistocene is dominated by alluvial and fluvial deposits consisting of thick clay coarse sand and fine sand layers interbedded terrestrial and marine sediments have been deposited since the late pleistocene three marine layers widely occur in the strata deposited during late pleistocene 35 40 ka bp and 110 120 ka bp and holocene transgressions yi et al 2012 generally coarse grained fluvial sediments are deposited during low sea level stands whereas during transgressions fine grained marine sediments dominated by clays silts and fine sands rich in organic materials are deposited larsen et al 2017 thus in the coastal aquitard aquifer system marine layers usually form as interlayered aquitards the thickness of aquitard formation between phreatic and confined groundwater is 2 8 m and about 20 70 m for aquitard between confined aquifers han et al 1996 while in the jiangsu coastal plain aquitard thickness can be up to 110 m kang 2017 influenced by historical transgressions modern seawater intrusion and tidal variations phreatic and the first confined aquifer are always saline and deeper confined aquifers are fresh mao et al 2020 xue et al 2000 the saline freshwater boundary depth is 50 100 m locally exceeding 200 m saline groundwater is seldom mined and is basically in a quasi static state in natural conditions three hyper saline underground brine layers have been detected in the bohai sea area with the total dissolved solids tds of 50 217 g l xue et al 2000 the distribution of brine groundwater is parallel to the coastline fig 1 most previous studies showed that the brines originated from ancient seawater during episodes of marine invasion and regression by the evaporation of ancient seawater and combination with re dissolution of salts and mixing han et al 2014 qi et al 2019 in jiangsu coastal plain there is no brine groundwater saline groundwater has a tds ranging from 3 to 30 g l shi et al 2015 the main recharge of shallow groundwater is precipitation and rivers and discharge is controlled by evaporation and artificial pumping for aquaculture and salt production mao et al 2020 for deep confined groundwater lateral flow and crossflow from phreatic groundwater are the primary recharge sources and artificial pumping is the only means of discharge kang 2017 over exploitation of subsurface fluid i e groundwater brine in the last 6 decades has resulted in a considerable decline in the coastal groundwater table forming several groundwater depression cones gao and luo 2016 2 2 studied boreholes the studied borehole was drilled originally for the monitoring of seawater intrusion the specific locations including the previous eight boreholes are shown in fig 1 li et al 2013 2015 2017a li et al 2017b ge et al 2017 four boreholes g1 g2 g3 and cfd are in the bohai bay western of bohai sea cy lz08 and lz12 boreholes are in the laizhou bay southern of the bohai sea the other six boreholes hycj hyds sy1 sy2 hyqd and hyyk are in the jiangsu coastal plain western of yellow sea table 1 gives details on boreholes depths the lithological columns of these boreholes were drawn based on the observations on the core samples with reference to the field logs fig 2 clayey aquitard including clay silty clay clayey silt and silt occupied 11 87 of the sediments with an average value of 61 for these boreholes and for a single aquitard sample the grain size less than 75 μm accounted for more than 50 sand layers are coarse sand fine sand silty fine sand and clayey sand with relatively higher permeability however formation since the late pleistocene depth 70 m are all fine grained sediments the average grain size is 45 51 μm for g1 g2 and g3 boreholes yang et al 2014 56 μm for lz12 and 40 μm for sy1 borehole ge 2018 according to the paleomagnetic dating of g2 g3 and sy1 boreholes the bottom depth of quaternary is 250 300 m holocene sediment thickness is around 15 20 m in the bohai sea coastal area and up to 20 30 m in the southern part of jiangsu coastal plain derived by peat 14c dating fig 2 xu et al 2018a xiao et al 2014 3 methods and materials 3 1 sampling undisturbed aquitard core samples and crushed samples were collected the detailed sampling information is listed in table 1 and depth of the samples is shown in fig 2 aquitard samples length of 20 cm the diameter of 8 cm were collected immediately after lifting the core to the ground surface to minimize evaporation the outer parts of 2 cm were cut off from the core to avoid contamination by drilling fluid the remaining samples were placed in aluminium skin packaging sealed with wax and stored at 4 c before testing crushed samples were collected from four boreholes cy lz12 lz08 and g2 fig 2 most crushed samples are clayey soil except a few from boreholes cy and lz12 which include fine sand about 200 g disturbed samples were tightly wrapped in preservative film and stored at 4 c before testing 3 2 porewater extractions 3 2 1 mechanical squeezing squeezing technique is widely applied to extracted porewater from the low permeability aquitard fernández et al 2014 aquitard samples were carried out by squeezing under a maximum pressure of 8 mpa the detailed extraction procedures are described by li et al 2013 the volume of the obtained porewater is 10 50 ml which depends on the soil water content this level pressures used for squeezing will not change the porewater major chemical components 3 2 2 leaching porewater of crushed samples was extracted by leaching for chloride analysis in boreholes g2 lz08 lz12 and cy leaching was done in batch experiments with 20 g of powdered samples in 100 ml of water for 24 h at room temperature after centrifugation and filtration 0 45 μm the leachates were collected mineral water reactions do not control chloride concentrations in porewater thus porewater cl concentrations were calculated from leachates concentration by the following equation rebeix et al 2014 cl pw d f cl l ω gc with cl pw being the cl concentration of the porewater cl l being the cl concentration of the leachate ω gc being the geochemical porosity d f being the dilution factor induced by the leaching in this case df is equal to 5 geochemical porosity or named anion accessible porosity is about 50 of the total porosity for cl in the clay rich zones gaucher et al 2009 the total porosity is approximated by saturated water content bromide concentrations are not analyzed for leachate owing to the geochemical reaction for br gerritse and george 1988 and also dilution leads to br concentration below the detection limit however the cl br ratios of leachate are provided for reference 3 2 3 vacuum distillation a vacuum distillation method was used to extract the porewater for stable isotope analysis for boreholes g1 g2 g3 cy hycj and sy1 table 1 about 100 g of crushed core sample was placed in a preparation line and then the system was evacuated to less than 10 pa and heated at a temperature of 100 c for 6 h ma et al 2017 the released water molecules were collected in traps frozen with liquid nitrogen 3 3 measurements cl and br concentrations of porewater and leachates were determined by liquid ionic chromatography ics 1100 the analytical error was estimated to be less than 0 01 mg l for both cl and br stable isotopes 18o and 2h were measured using gas isotope ratio mass spectrometry mat253 δ2h and δ18o are reported with respect to standard mean ocean water and the analytical reproducibility is better than 0 2 and 2 for δ18o and δ2h respectively 4 results 4 1 cl and br regional distribution of cl and br in the eastern china coastal plain is shown in table 2 the cl concentration of coastal aquitard porewater in 13 boreholes ranges from 6 8 to 64507 mg l exhibiting the highest value in laizhou bay followed by that in bohai bay and the lowest in the coastal region of jiangsu aquitard porewater at depth within 70 m mainly in holocene and late pleistocene sediments is occupied by saline water and brine water except for lz08 and cy boreholes which are 33 km apart from the coastline with the maximum cl value from 8523 to 64507 mg l fig 3 table 2 when depth exceeds 70 m porewater is much fresher in most boreholes with cl concentration less than 1000 mg l three types of cl concentration profiles are observed as shown in fig 3 the first popular cl profile i e cfd g1 g2 lz12 sy1 and sy2 in the coastal area is characterized by that cl concentration increases with depth and the peak value as high as 16826 mg l 64507 mg l in lz12 occurs at a depth of about 25 m then it decreases gradually to 1000 mg l at depth exceeding 70 m the second trend is that cl concentration decreases with depth and brine porewater occurs near the ground surface as in g3 and hyds boreholes cl decreases from 38036 mg l twice that of seawater to 1000 mg l in deeper porewater the occurrence of deep saline aquitard porewater at depths between 150 and 230 m is the third trend for cl variation which happened in the laizhou bay and yangtze delta area see lz08 hyyk and hyqd boreholes fig 3 borehole lz08 is in the salt fresh water transition zone and lithology is dominated by aquitards fig 2 porewater at depth 100 m has cl concentration ranging from 400 to 1103 mg l and br concentration below the detection limit at depths beyond 100 m cl concentration exhibits an increasing trend toward the underling aquifer up to 8 5 g l and with a narrow range of cl br ratios from 336 to 436 similar cl variations are also observed in hyyk and hyqd boreholes fig 3 porewater br concentration ranges from 0 2 to 372 mg l and is positively correlated with cl r2 0 9 fig 4 however relative to bohai bay and laizhou bay porewater br in the jiangsu coastal plain is much more enriched as shown in fig 4 samples from jiangsu province empty circle are located above the seawater dilution line the cl br ratio of porewater in laizhou bay and bohai bay is from 187 to 709 with an average of 436 while this ratio in jiangsu coastal plain is from 72 to 359 with an average of 76 significantly less than the value of seawater fig 4 4 2 2h and 18o isotopes porewater hydrogen and oxygen isotopes are much more enriched in the jiangsu coastal region than in the northern coastal region in bohai bay and laizhou bay porewater has a δ2h ranging from 84 7 to 29 9 av 62 5 δ18o ranging from 12 1 to 3 av 7 8 in jiangsu coastal plain porewater δ2h ranges from 88 3 to 14 5 with an average value of 42 2 δ18o ranges from 9 9 to 1 0 with an average value of 5 5 table 2 because δ2h and δ18o data are highly correlated and δ2h was plotted in profile fig 3 water isotopes display an enriched trend with depth and the peak value is at a depth of 25 m then depleted in deep fresher porewater however in the yangtze delta hyyk and hyqd deep porewater still has enriched water isotopes consistent with high cl concentration the relationship between δ2h and δ18o is shown in fig 5 and global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 2 δ18o 11 27 rozanski et al 1993 and local meteoric water lines lmwl in laizhou bay changyi weather station δ2h 7 8 δ18o 1 1 and jiangsu area nanjing weather station δ2h 8 49 δ18o 17 7 liu et al 2014 are shown for reference most porewater samples are close to the lmwl and gwml and the shallow water isotopes show enriched toward seawater in contrast samples in g3 and sy1 are in the right of the gmwl and the trend line is parallel to the gmwl approximately with the slope of 8 1 and 8 3 respectively table 2 correspondingly porewater in these two boreholes have d excess values d δ2h 8 2δ18o of 13 1 and 5 6 average value in holocene sediments the data of aquitard porewater samples in 13 boreholes can be found in the supplementary material 5 discussions 5 1 salinity origin of porewater cl and cl br ratios chloride and bromide are the only ions that can hardly precipitate under formation conditions and reflect their origins banner et al 1989 among the coastal 13 boreholes cy is in the front of the weihe river delta and is not within the scope of several transgressions fig 1 the porewater in cy is fresh and was recharged by precipitation as indicated by hydrogen and oxygen isotopes saline porewaters are occurrent in other 12 boreholes and their salinity origins are summarized based on the three trends of cl variations with depth the bell shaped curve of cl profiles fig 3 cfd g1 g2 lz12 sy1 and sy2 must be interpreted as the effect of diffusive transport of marine porewater out of the clayey aquitard this is in line with δ2h variations as shown in fig 3 the peak δ2h value is about 20 close to marine water conforming the marine origin of this water seawater intrusion has occurred in the last 60 years owing to the overexploitation of coastal aquifers han et al 2015 however seawater cannot transport into the aquitard several kilometers from the coastlines during such a short period the undeniable explanation is that saline aquitard porewaters in this depth interval are paleo seawater trapped in sediment during transgression and later it is not flushed by modern water this trapped paleo seawater in clayey aquitard and induced salinity distribution were also observed in red river delta and pearl river delta coastal regions larsen et al 2017 wang and jiao 2012 this is further suggested by aligned cl and br ions fig 4 the relatively lower cl br ratios relative to seawater exclude the halite dissolution as a significant process owing to the diffusive transport of marine porewater out of the clay the maximum cl value of porewater is 43 85 of standard seawater except for borehole lz12 in the laizhou bay porewater in lz12 has a maximum cl concentration of approximately four times that of bohai seawater before gypsum saturation fig 3 together with the cl br ratios of 293 indicating that brine originated from seawater evaporation fontes and matray 1993 xue et al 2000 qi et al 2019 the second trend is that cl concentration decreases with depth i e g3 hyds in comparison δ2h and δ18o values show peak value at a depth around 25 m the same as trend 1 for example the saltiest porewater in the g3 borehole has a cl concentration of 39881 mg l and δ2h of 51 at depth of 7 6 m fig 3 these surface brine porewater perhaps represent the ongoing formation of underground brine water originating from holocene seawater this is consistent with current brine groundwater in the laizhou bay which is characterized by high tds and relatively depleted water isotopes compared to seawater xue et al 2000 al et al 2015 while this phenomenon is distinct with brine water extracted from submarine sediment which has higher tds and positive δ2h values as shown in porewater from red sea schoell and faber 1978 and deep sea drilling projects friedman and hardcastle 1988 deuterium is a conservative constituent of pore fluids the negative δ2h values in brines were resulted from the diffusion transport with an upper boundary of fresh porewater near the ground surface which has an average δ2h of 61 6 li et al 2017a due to the larger diffusion coefficient of δ2h relative to cl hendry and wassenaar 1999 the transport velocity of the water molecule is expected to be faster than solute in addition the high salt concentrated porewater could be attributed to leakage of brine from coastal marine salterns which are widespread and always hundreds of years old bao 2014 g3 borehole is close to changlu saltern of tianjin city and hyds is just located in the guanxi salterns of lianyungang city however the vertical transport velocity of aquitard porewater generally ranges between 0 01 and 1 mm yr batlle aguilar et al 2016 the effective depth of saltern brine should be less than 1 m and these brine in g3 and hyds are at the depth of 3 7 m the deep saline aquitard porewater 40 seawater at a depth between 150 and 230 m is in the early pleistocene strata and cl shows an increasing trend toward adjacent aquifer i e lz08 hyyk caused by diffusion of saline aquifer groundwater into sediments containing fresh porewater developed during glacial periods xu et al 2018b han et al 2020 however this saline aquifer cannot be associated with present seawater intrusion evidenced by 14c age of 20 ka xu et al 2018b its higher salinity was subject to transgression during the glacial interglacial cycles li et al 2017b the changes in aquifer salinity can profoundly influence the evolution of aquitard cl profiles rufer et al 2018 harrington et al 2013 secondary saline aquitard porewater may convert to release salinity into aquifers especially when the saline aquifer has been desalinized harrington et al 2013 despite saline porewater is related to seawater cl br ratios show significant variability among boreholes from north to south cl br ratios change from 200 to 338 and then go down to 94 154 in the jiangsu coastal area fig 4 interestingly cl br ratio in the coastal saline aquifer groundwater is close to that of seawater 290 li et al 2017b any slight uptake or release of br may thus significantly affect the bromide concentration the varied cl br ratios in aquitard porewater could be resulted from the mixing of marine brine at different stages of evaporation that is depleted in chloride relative to bromide katz et al 2011 besides the accumulation of br may be caused by diagenetic processes of marine organic materials and organisms in the lagoons when the transgression retreated freeman 2007 cartwright et al 2004 and the pressure carried on aquitard during porewater extraction may promote this process br increase with pressure data in the supplementary material also during the infiltration process the clay membrane effects may concentrate bromide as the br ion is larger than the cl ion faye et al 2005 in general porewater bromide concentration in jiangsu coastal plain is much higher consistent with the higher organic carbon wang et al 2000 suggesting a significant role of organic materials on the bromide accumulation davis et al 1998 5 2 porewater diffusive mixing process cl and δ2h the relationship between cl and δ2h further proved the mixing process in porewater fig 6 near shore seawater samples collected from the yellow sea and bohai sea exhibit similar cl contents but distinct hydrogen isotopes in the high latitude zone near shore seawater isotopes are more depleted the δ2h is around 8 to 17 in yellow sea water collected from sheyang port fu 2015 n 3 and 22 to 35 for bohai sea water collected from laizhou bay liu et al 2017 yang et al 2016 this spatial variability on the isotopic composition of coastal seawater is mainly resulted from the recharge of local rivers and precipitation of which water isotopes are affected by the latitude effect in the coastal plain rozanski 2005 the fresh endmembers of porewater at different depths may be recharged in different climate conditions with similar lower cl content but various isotopes thus a few number of mixing lines between saline porewater and freshwater are given fig 6 saline porewater samples cl 1 2 g l along these mixing lines plot close to a marine saltwater endmember with higher salinity and more depleted water isotopes relative to modern seawater stressing the dominance of evaporated seawater brines in the mixing system this indicates that brine water used to be much more inland than it is today but the concentration was diverse along the coastal regions han et al 1996 as shown in fig 6 porewater samples in yangtze delta i e hyyk and hyqd exhibit a trend toward coastal seawater while shallow porewater in g3 has a trend toward brines fig 6 the average cl and δ2h values of brine collected from laizhou bay are 66 g l and 40 n 7 respectively han et al 2014 according to the mixing process the stable isotopic compositions of original fresh endmembers were estimated the δ2h values range from 30 to 40 in the yangtze river delta i e hyyk and hyqd from 42 to 55 in the huaihe river basin i e sy1 and sy2 and from 60 to 80 in the bohai bay area i e g1 g2 and cfd compared to the average δ2h value in local precipitation 49 45 69 in turn liu et al 2014 the wider range in δ2h values of freshwater endmembers in an area indicates that porewater was recharged during varied climate conditions i e a warmer holocene climate for shallow porewater and colder glacial period for deeper porewater hendry et al 2011 the extensive evaporation may further modify the water isotopes evidenced by significantly depleted deuterium excess d values in g3 and sy1 in addition the extensive rain events at 8 6 ka bp may make an attribution for the depletion of the isotopic values in some shallow porewaters among different coastal zones the distinct isotopic compositions of porewater represent the pronounced latitude effect of the recharged precipitation which is 2 1 for δ2h in north china liu et al 2014 during the water mixing process porewater cl and δ2h covariation is not observed in brackish porewater owing to the mixing of minor marine water 10 which has a large and measurable effect on the geochemistry but limited effect on δ2h and δ18o warner et al 2012 5 3 transport simulation of aquitard porewater cl as the tracer the saline porewater is mainly captured in the formation since late pleistocene with a depth less than 70 m fig 3 three transgression regression events fig 1 have played a dominant role in the salinization and freshening of coastal porewater yi et al 2012 xu et al 2018b han et al 2020 however the highly saline porewater at depth of 25 m could be mainly attributed to holocene transgression as a time of 5 ka period of regression is too short for the remaining holocene seawater to diffuse out han et al 2020 evidence supporting this holocene saltwater include corrected 14c ages of 4 ka in saline aquifer at depth intervals of 30 50 m and 66 73 m in the coastal plain zhou et al 1998 the original marine porewater in the pleistocene marine clay has been leached out before the deposition of the holocene clays owing to an upward and seaward transport of freshwater from the deep pleistocene sand larsen et al 2017 this is especially so because sea level was 120 m lower than the current sea level in the last glacial period waelbroeck et al 2002 an increased hydraulic gradient would enhance shallow groundwater flow furthermore the diffusive transport of porewater is affected by the thickness of aquitard and transport time al et al 2015 larsen et al 2017 han et al 2020 pointed that aquitard porewater has never reached an equilibrium state during several transgression regression cycles although pleistocene marine water may not be totally flushed by freshwater it will make a small contribution to the shallow saline porewater as the remaining porewater would have a uniform lower cl concentration of 1 2 g l after the last flushing period of approximately 35 ka before holocene transgression han et al 2020 diffusive molecular transport is dominant in the aquitard porewater in terms of the shape of 1 d vertical conservative tracer profiles fig 3 hendry et al 2011 although diffusion causes some homogenization of the water in the sediment column the low value of the effective diffusion coefficient results in only partial homogenization schoell and faber 1978 to identify the timescales of porewater transport process in association with sea level changes one dimensional advection diffusion simulation was constructed selected eight profiles which have enough data sets were simulated table 3 the differential equation governing the conservative tracer cl through the aquitard system can be described by 1

this paper d e values in aquitards in the jiangsu coastal regions are referenced from ge 2018 using the laboratory diffusion cell experiments van der kamp et al 1996 savoye et al 2006 the d e of cl in aquitard samples were measured at a depth of 33 55 m of 1 6 2 7 10 10 m2 s in the bohai coastal regions d e value of 6 10 10 m2 s was adopted based on the measurement on a g1 borehole sample and previous studies in tianjin han et al 2020 the calculation for the linear velocity of porewater is based on darcy s law using the laboratory penetration test on shallow aquitard samples at a pressure of 0 8 mpa hydraulic conductivity k for bohai and jiangsu coastal area was determined to be 9 10 10 and 1 8 10 9 m s respectively ge 2018 the k values in laizhou bay aquitard are in range of 2 5 6 7 10 9 m s han et al 1996 this research used the hydraulic conductivity values determined above as the initial for the simulation works in the respective areas during the simulation variation of parameters with time induced by the deformation of clayey aquitard was not considered which may also have an important influence on porewater transport the coastal plain is the regional discharge area in the north china plain due to the flat landscape an upward hydraulic gradient of approximately 2 was used in the simulation han et al 2020 equations 1 4 were solved using a finite element method which was implemented in comsol multiphysics li et al 2017b the domain is depth m width 1 m and free triangular is adopted for spatial discretization with the elements size of 1 m which is convergent for the simulation though much finer meshwork would improve the computational accuracy yan et al 2020 the relative change rate of the simulated values is less than 0 1 when they were compared to elements of size 0 5 and 1 m a total thickness of 40 70 m fine grained sediment average grain size of 45 56 μm yang et al 2014 ge 2018 since the late pleistocene was used for simulation to figure out the saline porewater evolution in the model the marine transgression and regression events throughout the holocene were simulated using a moving upper boundary to represent the deposition processes during the holocene sedimentation larsen et al 2017 the rate of movement was set as the sedimentation rate and undeposited cells were assigned as inactive transport cells to ensure they did not contribute to flow or cl transport after the sediment in a cell was deposited the cell was reactivated for solute transport han et al 2020 the detailed simulation method is as follows the column of holocene sediment was represented as multiple layers having a uniform thickness of 1 m just like a cfd model 20 layers were divided for the holocene sediment the bottom layer of the pleistocene sediment was set to active in the initial state and assigned an initial freshwater concentration of 100 mg l according to the deep fresh porewater the transport model was split into 20 successive time slices with the transgression time of 8 ka and the time of seawater withdrawal from the studied area referring to the changes of shoreline fig 1 xue 2009 the simulated concentration at the end of each time slice was used as the starting concentration for the subsequent time slice during the salinization period the initial cl concentration beyond average seawater was adopted eq 2 as the widespread underground brine in the coastal plain han et al 1996 in the freshening period the initial concentration of the reactive cell was assigned 100 mg l if however further salinization occurred brine cl concentration was assigned table 3 a constant concentration was set at the upper boundary equation 3 and outflow was set at the lower boundary to allow solute to diffuse out because of the non stable state of aquitard solute in this depth interval eq 4 while only constant concentration was set as the lower boundary for borehole lz08 at the depth of 150 m a deep aquifer to explain the diffusion from saline aquifer into adjacent aquitard table 3 the depth range of the holocene marine layer was estimated by field observation of marine shells in sediment and bottom depth of holocene layer in the coastal zone xu et al 2011 fig 2 input parameters based on the lithological distribution and the settings in these simulations are given in table 3 in the bohai sea coastal plain modeling results confirmed porewater in the marine layer are trapped holocene seawater with the onset time of 8 ka and once experienced evaporation table 3 indicating a dry climate in the middle holocene in china wang et al 2007 subsequently porewaters were flushed by freshwater for a period of 2 3 ka fig 7 after desalination the maximum cl concentration in cfd and g1 was reduced to below that of seawater the current underground brine in the bohai bay receded eastward fig 1 the cl depth profiles is more sensitive to the de parameter changes of de will significantly influence the peak cl value while the advection velocity variations would change the position of peak cl value the optimized de parameters are between 1 and 3 5 10 10 m2 s constrained by the transport time fig 7 diffusion is indicated as the predominant transport mechanism for porewater with a small upward velocity of 0 03 0 6 mm yr in natural conditions fig 7 a peclet number is often used to decide whether transport by advection should be considered as calculated from the flowing equation the peclet number p e v e d d e d i s t h e a v e r a g e p a r t i c l e d i a m e t e r m freeze and cherry 1979 is 0 01 1 1 10 5 1 confirming the dominant diffusion transport in aquitard however influenced by the over extraction of groundwater in the last 6 decades cl profiles in the g1 and lz12 boreholes were further modified the groundwater table monitoring showed that a large vertical hydraulic gradient of 22 40 was generated in the south of tianjin city 1968 1996 data which forced an obvious downward flow of shallow saline water wang 2004 also the extraction of brines in laizhou bay for salt production and aquaculture has begun for hundreds of years and has been more prevalent since the 1970 s han et al 1996 a downward velocity increasing from 36 mm yr at the brine funnel edge to 600 mm yr at the funnel center was observed and thus led to the decline of brine tds by 30 g l per year guan 2009 therefore in the period of t3 a downward velocity of 50 63 mm yr hydraulic gradient of 33 42 about 170 times of upward velocity was adopted the cl depth profile reasonably matched the observed values fig 7 g1 lz12 the peak position of cl dropped by about 6 m in the depressions of bohai bay i e g3 porewater showed continuous salinization even after the seawater receded evaporation is the cause of local high salinity brines of tds 100 g l in the bohai bay han et al 1996 using an upward velocity of 0 6 mm yr the simulated brine porewater occurred close to the ground surface with a maximum cl of 66 g l at end of t2 fig 7 g3 well mixing trend between brine water with cl of 66 g l and porewater li et al 2017a further proved the rationality of the upper boundary the saline deep aquitard porewater at a depth below 100 m is caused by the adjacent saline aquifer s salinity input the best fits indicated that aquifer at 130 150 m in laizhou bay lz08 borehole was intruded by seawater at 5 ka bp with an induced cl of 8600 mg l fig 7 this is consistent with the simulation conducted by li et al 2017b in hyyk borehole the intruded aquifer is possibly a paleo channel as much more coarse sediments in this depth interval the occurrence of multiple paleo channels in the laizhou bay miao 2014 would make the transport of saline water more complicated as these can act as preferred pathways for water transport between aquifers and the sea larsen et al 2017 seawater withdrawal from the studied borehole sites in jiangsu coastal plain was much later the paleo yellow river entered into the south yellow sea in ce 1128 1855 which forced the coastline to move east zhou et al 2014 a time of 1 ka was then applied for freshening fig 7 sy1 sy2 and hyqd although brine aquifer was not observed in this area at present the simulated results suggested that evaporated seawater with cl concentration of 27 g l ever existed this lower salinity relative to the north coastal plain may be resulted from warm and humid climate and the abundant surface waters which played an essential role of dilution 6 conclusions five deep borehole profiles of naturally occurring tracers cl br δ2h and δ18o were measured in aquitards in the china eastern coastal plain combined analysis of previous eight borehole profiles to define the salinity origin and transport time scales of porewater across the aquitard porewater salinity showed spatial consistency of vertical distribution that is the higher cl value was observed near the bottom of holocene sediment in most sites associated with holocene transgression and later porewater was partially flushed by freshwater during regression this is evidenced by cl and δ2h mixing model however porewater can show ongoing evaporation to be brine near ground surface in some depression zone i e g3 hyds characterized by high salinity and depleted water isotopes deep saline porewater depth 150 230 m was observed locally caused by the salinity input of adjacent aquifer where it is most likely a paleo channel in preference to seawater intrusion the chloride transport simulations using the 1 d modelling approach showed that cl distribution is controlled by alternating seawater and freshwater diffusion modelling results supported that diffusion is the dominant transport across aquitard with an upward velocity of 0 03 0 6 mm yr but indicated solute transport has also been affected by reversed advective flow in the areas where extensive pumping occurred in recent 60 years the downward porewater velocity of 50 mm yr and 63 mm yr were derived for g1 and lz12 boreholes stressing the significant influence of pumping on the porewater salinity distribution the simulations suggested that the initial marine water was trapped holocene seawater but experienced evaporation however due to the different geological and climatic conditions the underground brine showed different salinities across the region the rise of global sea level in the early holocene has been recognized all over the world the trapped seawater is still present in low permeability aquitard and leaches into adjacent sediments we emphasize that the redistribution of marine saltwater in the aquitard is a significant cause of groundwater salinization furthermore the saltwater resulting from seawater intrusion into the aquitard can also become a long term pollution source ancient paleo channels in particular would be used as a priority outlet resulting in seawater intrusion credit authorship contribution statement jing li conceptualization data curation formal analysis xulong gong

3959,aquitards can preserve paleo saltwater and have a long and profound influence on the aquifer groundwater yet they have received less attention here five one dimensional vertical profiles of the natural tracers cl br δ2h and δ18o of aquitard porewater were measured and combined with eight existing profiles collected from previous studies in three eastern china coastal plains bohai bay laizhou bay and jiangsu coastal plain to show the salinity origin and the timescale of the transport of porewater across aquitards since the mid holocene evidence of paleo seawater impacted by holocene transgression is noticed as peak cl concentration enriched water isotopes and lower cl br ratios are observed in the porewater at about the bottom depth of holocene of 25 m the shape of cl profiles and associated 1 d transport models confirms holocene seawater s presence in the sediment and the alternating transgression and regression control the salinity evolution of coastal aquitard porewater diffusion is the dominant transport across aquitard with an upward velocity between 0 03 and 0 6 mm yr reverse advective flow has affected the solute transport in areas of extensive pumping anthropogenic activities enhance the leaching of salty porewater into aquifers in coastal areas necessitating the need for research focused on marine aquitard salty water keywords porewater aquitard salinization coastal plain china 1 introduction groundwater constitutes a significant proportion of the water resources in the densely populated coastal regions but is frequently salty or brackish numerous studies have characterized groundwater salinization regimes abu alnaeem et al 2018 han et al 2011 han et al 2015 jiao et al 2010 li et al 2017a van engelen et al 2018 processes resulting in high salinity groundwater in coastal aquifers include recent natural or pumped induced seawater or saltwater intrusion han et al 2015 evaporation or dissolution of marine evaporite wang and jiao 2012 a complex salinization process is encountered in the coastal area that is groundwater salinization during multiple transgressions or by the diffusion of connate seawater trapped in clay rich aquitard han et al 2020 larsen et al 2017 wang et al 2013 transgression and regression cycles are prevailing during the quaternary period yi et al 2012 which may affect groundwater salinity on a geological time scale ascertaining the origin of paleo salinity and spatial distribution related to the geological history is crucial for the effective management of the available water resources in the coastal regions many studies on european african and australian coastal aquifer systems found that paleo seawater was still present in holocene aged sediments and leached salinity into aquifers post et al 2003 manzano et al 2001 sivan et al 2005 harrington et al 2013 significant correlation between the chloride concentrations in aquitard porewater and groundwater in the aquifer further indicated the strong influence of the aquitard on aquifer salinity wang et al 2013 thick layers of aquitard comprised of clayey soils are widespread along the china muddy coast 4000 km including bohai bay laizhou bay and jiangsu coastal area han et al 1996 provided connate seawater occurred widely in the coastal aquitard it may become the main salinity source instead of modern seawater however few studies in the china coastal regions have shown the ability of aquitard to preserve paleo seawater related to historical transgressions exceptions include profiles of aquitard porewater in bohai bay jiangsu coastal plain and the pearl river delta which focused on the geochemical signatures salinity origin major ions and trace elements variations and water rock interactions in the porewater wang et al 2013 li et al 2013 li et al 2015 li et al 2017a li et al 2017b ge et al 2017 various salinity vertical profiles from literature boreholes were observed which were resulted from different hydrological processes while the timescales of aquitard porewater transport process associated with paleo hydrological evolution and the hydraulic connections with aquifers are poorly understood diffusion is expected to be the dominant transport mechanism in low permeability aquitard xie et al 2011 2015 chen et al 2009 and the residence time of porewater can be up to thousands to millions of years al et al 2015 bensenouci et al 2014 natural tracer profiles such as cl br h o isotopes and helium 4 of aquitard porewater and associated transport simulation can give significant insights for long time climatic and geologic shifts and paleo infiltration of aquifer system hendry et al 2013 waber et al 2012 gardner et al 2012 hendry and harrington 2014 priestley et al 2018 in china coastal plain only two porewater transport simulation works interpreted the salinity profile han et al 2020 and ge et al 2017 conducted a one dimensional simulation of porewater transport in aquitard since 260 ka bp and 24 ka bp respectively involving several times transgression and regression events yet without consideration of the influence of coastal aquifer over extraction or the rate of sedimentation much more studies are needed to figure out the complex mechanism of salinity evolution in aquitard porewater in this paper aquitard samples were collected from five deep boreholes along the coastal regions of eastern china fig 1 natural tracer 2h 18o cl br profiles of porewater were measured to identify the salinity evolution related to holocene transgression and regression events these profiles were also compared to eight existing profiles at the adjacent areas li et al 2013 2015 2017a li et al 2017b ge et al 2017 porewater transport processes were simulated using a 1 d model to evaluate the porewater transport timescales through the aquitard this study will enhance the understanding of the salinization and freshening processes of coastal aquitard porewater in quaternary coastal plain worldwide 2 background of the study area 2 1 hydrogeology the studied area is located in the china eastern coastal plain including the coastal regions of bohai sea and yellow sea fig 1 the coastal plain of bohai sea i e bohai bay and laizhou bay has a sub humid monsoon climate with an average air temperature of 10 12 the average annual precipitation is 600 700 mm and the evapotranspiration is 1900 2400 mm han et al 2014 li et al 2017a the coastal region of yellow sea i e jiangsu coastal plain is relatively warmer and wetter it has an average air temperature of 13 15 and the average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration is 1050 and 877 mm respectively kang 2017 elevation of the coastal plain is relatively low about 30 50 m a s l in bohai sea area 3 9 m a s l in jiangsu area with an average slope of 0 3 0 5 toward the sea the main river systems distributed in the plain from north to south are luanhe river haihe river yellow river huaihe river and yangtze river and a river delta was formed in the area where it entered the sea quaternary sediments range in thickness from 200 to 350 m in the western bohai bay 50 400 m in the laizhou bay and 100 to 370 m in the jiangsu coastal plain han et al 1996 kang 2017 overall from the delta front to sea sediment grain size changes from coarse to fine in profile sediment in the early and middle pleistocene is dominated by alluvial and fluvial deposits consisting of thick clay coarse sand and fine sand layers interbedded terrestrial and marine sediments have been deposited since the late pleistocene three marine layers widely occur in the strata deposited during late pleistocene 35 40 ka bp and 110 120 ka bp and holocene transgressions yi et al 2012 generally coarse grained fluvial sediments are deposited during low sea level stands whereas during transgressions fine grained marine sediments dominated by clays silts and fine sands rich in organic materials are deposited larsen et al 2017 thus in the coastal aquitard aquifer system marine layers usually form as interlayered aquitards the thickness of aquitard formation between phreatic and confined groundwater is 2 8 m and about 20 70 m for aquitard between confined aquifers han et al 1996 while in the jiangsu coastal plain aquitard thickness can be up to 110 m kang 2017 influenced by historical transgressions modern seawater intrusion and tidal variations phreatic and the first confined aquifer are always saline and deeper confined aquifers are fresh mao et al 2020 xue et al 2000 the saline freshwater boundary depth is 50 100 m locally exceeding 200 m saline groundwater is seldom mined and is basically in a quasi static state in natural conditions three hyper saline underground brine layers have been detected in the bohai sea area with the total dissolved solids tds of 50 217 g l xue et al 2000 the distribution of brine groundwater is parallel to the coastline fig 1 most previous studies showed that the brines originated from ancient seawater during episodes of marine invasion and regression by the evaporation of ancient seawater and combination with re dissolution of salts and mixing han et al 2014 qi et al 2019 in jiangsu coastal plain there is no brine groundwater saline groundwater has a tds ranging from 3 to 30 g l shi et al 2015 the main recharge of shallow groundwater is precipitation and rivers and discharge is controlled by evaporation and artificial pumping for aquaculture and salt production mao et al 2020 for deep confined groundwater lateral flow and crossflow from phreatic groundwater are the primary recharge sources and artificial pumping is the only means of discharge kang 2017 over exploitation of subsurface fluid i e groundwater brine in the last 6 decades has resulted in a considerable decline in the coastal groundwater table forming several groundwater depression cones gao and luo 2016 2 2 studied boreholes the studied borehole was drilled originally for the monitoring of seawater intrusion the specific locations including the previous eight boreholes are shown in fig 1 li et al 2013 2015 2017a li et al 2017b ge et al 2017 four boreholes g1 g2 g3 and cfd are in the bohai bay western of bohai sea cy lz08 and lz12 boreholes are in the laizhou bay southern of the bohai sea the other six boreholes hycj hyds sy1 sy2 hyqd and hyyk are in the jiangsu coastal plain western of yellow sea table 1 gives details on boreholes depths the lithological columns of these boreholes were drawn based on the observations on the core samples with reference to the field logs fig 2 clayey aquitard including clay silty clay clayey silt and silt occupied 11 87 of the sediments with an average value of 61 for these boreholes and for a single aquitard sample the grain size less than 75 μm accounted for more than 50 sand layers are coarse sand fine sand silty fine sand and clayey sand with relatively higher permeability however formation since the late pleistocene depth 70 m are all fine grained sediments the average grain size is 45 51 μm for g1 g2 and g3 boreholes yang et al 2014 56 μm for lz12 and 40 μm for sy1 borehole ge 2018 according to the paleomagnetic dating of g2 g3 and sy1 boreholes the bottom depth of quaternary is 250 300 m holocene sediment thickness is around 15 20 m in the bohai sea coastal area and up to 20 30 m in the southern part of jiangsu coastal plain derived by peat 14c dating fig 2 xu et al 2018a xiao et al 2014 3 methods and materials 3 1 sampling undisturbed aquitard core samples and crushed samples were collected the detailed sampling information is listed in table 1 and depth of the samples is shown in fig 2 aquitard samples length of 20 cm the diameter of 8 cm were collected immediately after lifting the core to the ground surface to minimize evaporation the outer parts of 2 cm were cut off from the core to avoid contamination by drilling fluid the remaining samples were placed in aluminium skin packaging sealed with wax and stored at 4 c before testing crushed samples were collected from four boreholes cy lz12 lz08 and g2 fig 2 most crushed samples are clayey soil except a few from boreholes cy and lz12 which include fine sand about 200 g disturbed samples were tightly wrapped in preservative film and stored at 4 c before testing 3 2 porewater extractions 3 2 1 mechanical squeezing squeezing technique is widely applied to extracted porewater from the low permeability aquitard fernández et al 2014 aquitard samples were carried out by squeezing under a maximum pressure of 8 mpa the detailed extraction procedures are described by li et al 2013 the volume of the obtained porewater is 10 50 ml which depends on the soil water content this level pressures used for squeezing will not change the porewater major chemical components 3 2 2 leaching porewater of crushed samples was extracted by leaching for chloride analysis in boreholes g2 lz08 lz12 and cy leaching was done in batch experiments with 20 g of powdered samples in 100 ml of water for 24 h at room temperature after centrifugation and filtration 0 45 μm the leachates were collected mineral water reactions do not control chloride concentrations in porewater thus porewater cl concentrations were calculated from leachates concentration by the following equation rebeix et al 2014 cl pw d f cl l ω gc with cl pw being the cl concentration of the porewater cl l being the cl concentration of the leachate ω gc being the geochemical porosity d f being the dilution factor induced by the leaching in this case df is equal to 5 geochemical porosity or named anion accessible porosity is about 50 of the total porosity for cl in the clay rich zones gaucher et al 2009 the total porosity is approximated by saturated water content bromide concentrations are not analyzed for leachate owing to the geochemical reaction for br gerritse and george 1988 and also dilution leads to br concentration below the detection limit however the cl br ratios of leachate are provided for reference 3 2 3 vacuum distillation a vacuum distillation method was used to extract the porewater for stable isotope analysis for boreholes g1 g2 g3 cy hycj and sy1 table 1 about 100 g of crushed core sample was placed in a preparation line and then the system was evacuated to less than 10 pa and heated at a temperature of 100 c for 6 h ma et al 2017 the released water molecules were collected in traps frozen with liquid nitrogen 3 3 measurements cl and br concentrations of porewater and leachates were determined by liquid ionic chromatography ics 1100 the analytical error was estimated to be less than 0 01 mg l for both cl and br stable isotopes 18o and 2h were measured using gas isotope ratio mass spectrometry mat253 δ2h and δ18o are reported with respect to standard mean ocean water and the analytical reproducibility is better than 0 2 and 2 for δ18o and δ2h respectively 4 results 4 1 cl and br regional distribution of cl and br in the eastern china coastal plain is shown in table 2 the cl concentration of coastal aquitard porewater in 13 boreholes ranges from 6 8 to 64507 mg l exhibiting the highest value in laizhou bay followed by that in bohai bay and the lowest in the coastal region of jiangsu aquitard porewater at depth within 70 m mainly in holocene and late pleistocene sediments is occupied by saline water and brine water except for lz08 and cy boreholes which are 33 km apart from the coastline with the maximum cl value from 8523 to 64507 mg l fig 3 table 2 when depth exceeds 70 m porewater is much fresher in most boreholes with cl concentration less than 1000 mg l three types of cl concentration profiles are observed as shown in fig 3 the first popular cl profile i e cfd g1 g2 lz12 sy1 and sy2 in the coastal area is characterized by that cl concentration increases with depth and the peak value as high as 16826 mg l 64507 mg l in lz12 occurs at a depth of about 25 m then it decreases gradually to 1000 mg l at depth exceeding 70 m the second trend is that cl concentration decreases with depth and brine porewater occurs near the ground surface as in g3 and hyds boreholes cl decreases from 38036 mg l twice that of seawater to 1000 mg l in deeper porewater the occurrence of deep saline aquitard porewater at depths between 150 and 230 m is the third trend for cl variation which happened in the laizhou bay and yangtze delta area see lz08 hyyk and hyqd boreholes fig 3 borehole lz08 is in the salt fresh water transition zone and lithology is dominated by aquitards fig 2 porewater at depth 100 m has cl concentration ranging from 400 to 1103 mg l and br concentration below the detection limit at depths beyond 100 m cl concentration exhibits an increasing trend toward the underling aquifer up to 8 5 g l and with a narrow range of cl br ratios from 336 to 436 similar cl variations are also observed in hyyk and hyqd boreholes fig 3 porewater br concentration ranges from 0 2 to 372 mg l and is positively correlated with cl r2 0 9 fig 4 however relative to bohai bay and laizhou bay porewater br in the jiangsu coastal plain is much more enriched as shown in fig 4 samples from jiangsu province empty circle are located above the seawater dilution line the cl br ratio of porewater in laizhou bay and bohai bay is from 187 to 709 with an average of 436 while this ratio in jiangsu coastal plain is from 72 to 359 with an average of 76 significantly less than the value of seawater fig 4 4 2 2h and 18o isotopes porewater hydrogen and oxygen isotopes are much more enriched in the jiangsu coastal region than in the northern coastal region in bohai bay and laizhou bay porewater has a δ2h ranging from 84 7 to 29 9 av 62 5 δ18o ranging from 12 1 to 3 av 7 8 in jiangsu coastal plain porewater δ2h ranges from 88 3 to 14 5 with an average value of 42 2 δ18o ranges from 9 9 to 1 0 with an average value of 5 5 table 2 because δ2h and δ18o data are highly correlated and δ2h was plotted in profile fig 3 water isotopes display an enriched trend with depth and the peak value is at a depth of 25 m then depleted in deep fresher porewater however in the yangtze delta hyyk and hyqd deep porewater still has enriched water isotopes consistent with high cl concentration the relationship between δ2h and δ18o is shown in fig 5 and global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 2 δ18o 11 27 rozanski et al 1993 and local meteoric water lines lmwl in laizhou bay changyi weather station δ2h 7 8 δ18o 1 1 and jiangsu area nanjing weather station δ2h 8 49 δ18o 17 7 liu et al 2014 are shown for reference most porewater samples are close to the lmwl and gwml and the shallow water isotopes show enriched toward seawater in contrast samples in g3 and sy1 are in the right of the gmwl and the trend line is parallel to the gmwl approximately with the slope of 8 1 and 8 3 respectively table 2 correspondingly porewater in these two boreholes have d excess values d δ2h 8 2δ18o of 13 1 and 5 6 average value in holocene sediments the data of aquitard porewater samples in 13 boreholes can be found in the supplementary material 5 discussions 5 1 salinity origin of porewater cl and cl br ratios chloride and bromide are the only ions that can hardly precipitate under formation conditions and reflect their origins banner et al 1989 among the coastal 13 boreholes cy is in the front of the weihe river delta and is not within the scope of several transgressions fig 1 the porewater in cy is fresh and was recharged by precipitation as indicated by hydrogen and oxygen isotopes saline porewaters are occurrent in other 12 boreholes and their salinity origins are summarized based on the three trends of cl variations with depth the bell shaped curve of cl profiles fig 3 cfd g1 g2 lz12 sy1 and sy2 must be interpreted as the effect of diffusive transport of marine porewater out of the clayey aquitard this is in line with δ2h variations as shown in fig 3 the peak δ2h value is about 20 close to marine water conforming the marine origin of this water seawater intrusion has occurred in the last 60 years owing to the overexploitation of coastal aquifers han et al 2015 however seawater cannot transport into the aquitard several kilometers from the coastlines during such a short period the undeniable explanation is that saline aquitard porewaters in this depth interval are paleo seawater trapped in sediment during transgression and later it is not flushed by modern water this trapped paleo seawater in clayey aquitard and induced salinity distribution were also observed in red river delta and pearl river delta coastal regions larsen et al 2017 wang and jiao 2012 this is further suggested by aligned cl and br ions fig 4 the relatively lower cl br ratios relative to seawater exclude the halite dissolution as a significant process owing to the diffusive transport of marine porewater out of the clay the maximum cl value of porewater is 43 85 of standard seawater except for borehole lz12 in the laizhou bay porewater in lz12 has a maximum cl concentration of approximately four times that of bohai seawater before gypsum saturation fig 3 together with the cl br ratios of 293 indicating that brine originated from seawater evaporation fontes and matray 1993 xue et al 2000 qi et al 2019 the second trend is that cl concentration decreases with depth i e g3 hyds in comparison δ2h and δ18o values show peak value at a depth around 25 m the same as trend 1 for example the saltiest porewater in the g3 borehole has a cl concentration of 39881 mg l and δ2h of 51 at depth of 7 6 m fig 3 these surface brine porewater perhaps represent the ongoing formation of underground brine water originating from holocene seawater this is consistent with current brine groundwater in the laizhou bay which is characterized by high tds and relatively depleted water isotopes compared to seawater xue et al 2000 al et al 2015 while this phenomenon is distinct with brine water extracted from submarine sediment which has higher tds and positive δ2h values as shown in porewater from red sea schoell and faber 1978 and deep sea drilling projects friedman and hardcastle 1988 deuterium is a conservative constituent of pore fluids the negative δ2h values in brines were resulted from the diffusion transport with an upper boundary of fresh porewater near the ground surface which has an average δ2h of 61 6 li et al 2017a due to the larger diffusion coefficient of δ2h relative to cl hendry and wassenaar 1999 the transport velocity of the water molecule is expected to be faster than solute in addition the high salt concentrated porewater could be attributed to leakage of brine from coastal marine salterns which are widespread and always hundreds of years old bao 2014 g3 borehole is close to changlu saltern of tianjin city and hyds is just located in the guanxi salterns of lianyungang city however the vertical transport velocity of aquitard porewater generally ranges between 0 01 and 1 mm yr batlle aguilar et al 2016 the effective depth of saltern brine should be less than 1 m and these brine in g3 and hyds are at the depth of 3 7 m the deep saline aquitard porewater 40 seawater at a depth between 150 and 230 m is in the early pleistocene strata and cl shows an increasing trend toward adjacent aquifer i e lz08 hyyk caused by diffusion of saline aquifer groundwater into sediments containing fresh porewater developed during glacial periods xu et al 2018b han et al 2020 however this saline aquifer cannot be associated with present seawater intrusion evidenced by 14c age of 20 ka xu et al 2018b its higher salinity was subject to transgression during the glacial interglacial cycles li et al 2017b the changes in aquifer salinity can profoundly influence the evolution of aquitard cl profiles rufer et al 2018 harrington et al 2013 secondary saline aquitard porewater may convert to release salinity into aquifers especially when the saline aquifer has been desalinized harrington et al 2013 despite saline porewater is related to seawater cl br ratios show significant variability among boreholes from north to south cl br ratios change from 200 to 338 and then go down to 94 154 in the jiangsu coastal area fig 4 interestingly cl br ratio in the coastal saline aquifer groundwater is close to that of seawater 290 li et al 2017b any slight uptake or release of br may thus significantly affect the bromide concentration the varied cl br ratios in aquitard porewater could be resulted from the mixing of marine brine at different stages of evaporation that is depleted in chloride relative to bromide katz et al 2011 besides the accumulation of br may be caused by diagenetic processes of marine organic materials and organisms in the lagoons when the transgression retreated freeman 2007 cartwright et al 2004 and the pressure carried on aquitard during porewater extraction may promote this process br increase with pressure data in the supplementary material also during the infiltration process the clay membrane effects may concentrate bromide as the br ion is larger than the cl ion faye et al 2005 in general porewater bromide concentration in jiangsu coastal plain is much higher consistent with the higher organic carbon wang et al 2000 suggesting a significant role of organic materials on the bromide accumulation davis et al 1998 5 2 porewater diffusive mixing process cl and δ2h the relationship between cl and δ2h further proved the mixing process in porewater fig 6 near shore seawater samples collected from the yellow sea and bohai sea exhibit similar cl contents but distinct hydrogen isotopes in the high latitude zone near shore seawater isotopes are more depleted the δ2h is around 8 to 17 in yellow sea water collected from sheyang port fu 2015 n 3 and 22 to 35 for bohai sea water collected from laizhou bay liu et al 2017 yang et al 2016 this spatial variability on the isotopic composition of coastal seawater is mainly resulted from the recharge of local rivers and precipitation of which water isotopes are affected by the latitude effect in the coastal plain rozanski 2005 the fresh endmembers of porewater at different depths may be recharged in different climate conditions with similar lower cl content but various isotopes thus a few number of mixing lines between saline porewater and freshwater are given fig 6 saline porewater samples cl 1 2 g l along these mixing lines plot close to a marine saltwater endmember with higher salinity and more depleted water isotopes relative to modern seawater stressing the dominance of evaporated seawater brines in the mixing system this indicates that brine water used to be much more inland than it is today but the concentration was diverse along the coastal regions han et al 1996 as shown in fig 6 porewater samples in yangtze delta i e hyyk and hyqd exhibit a trend toward coastal seawater while shallow porewater in g3 has a trend toward brines fig 6 the average cl and δ2h values of brine collected from laizhou bay are 66 g l and 40 n 7 respectively han et al 2014 according to the mixing process the stable isotopic compositions of original fresh endmembers were estimated the δ2h values range from 30 to 40 in the yangtze river delta i e hyyk and hyqd from 42 to 55 in the huaihe river basin i e sy1 and sy2 and from 60 to 80 in the bohai bay area i e g1 g2 and cfd compared to the average δ2h value in local precipitation 49 45 69 in turn liu et al 2014 the wider range in δ2h values of freshwater endmembers in an area indicates that porewater was recharged during varied climate conditions i e a warmer holocene climate for shallow porewater and colder glacial period for deeper porewater hendry et al 2011 the extensive evaporation may further modify the water isotopes evidenced by significantly depleted deuterium excess d values in g3 and sy1 in addition the extensive rain events at 8 6 ka bp may make an attribution for the depletion of the isotopic values in some shallow porewaters among different coastal zones the distinct isotopic compositions of porewater represent the pronounced latitude effect of the recharged precipitation which is 2 1 for δ2h in north china liu et al 2014 during the water mixing process porewater cl and δ2h covariation is not observed in brackish porewater owing to the mixing of minor marine water 10 which has a large and measurable effect on the geochemistry but limited effect on δ2h and δ18o warner et al 2012 5 3 transport simulation of aquitard porewater cl as the tracer the saline porewater is mainly captured in the formation since late pleistocene with a depth less than 70 m fig 3 three transgression regression events fig 1 have played a dominant role in the salinization and freshening of coastal porewater yi et al 2012 xu et al 2018b han et al 2020 however the highly saline porewater at depth of 25 m could be mainly attributed to holocene transgression as a time of 5 ka period of regression is too short for the remaining holocene seawater to diffuse out han et al 2020 evidence supporting this holocene saltwater include corrected 14c ages of 4 ka in saline aquifer at depth intervals of 30 50 m and 66 73 m in the coastal plain zhou et al 1998 the original marine porewater in the pleistocene marine clay has been leached out before the deposition of the holocene clays owing to an upward and seaward transport of freshwater from the deep pleistocene sand larsen et al 2017 this is especially so because sea level was 120 m lower than the current sea level in the last glacial period waelbroeck et al 2002 an increased hydraulic gradient would enhance shallow groundwater flow furthermore the diffusive transport of porewater is affected by the thickness of aquitard and transport time al et al 2015 larsen et al 2017 han et al 2020 pointed that aquitard porewater has never reached an equilibrium state during several transgression regression cycles although pleistocene marine water may not be totally flushed by freshwater it will make a small contribution to the shallow saline porewater as the remaining porewater would have a uniform lower cl concentration of 1 2 g l after the last flushing period of approximately 35 ka before holocene transgression han et al 2020 diffusive molecular transport is dominant in the aquitard porewater in terms of the shape of 1 d vertical conservative tracer profiles fig 3 hendry et al 2011 although diffusion causes some homogenization of the water in the sediment column the low value of the effective diffusion coefficient results in only partial homogenization schoell and faber 1978 to identify the timescales of porewater transport process in association with sea level changes one dimensional advection diffusion simulation was constructed selected eight profiles which have enough data sets were simulated table 3 the differential equation governing the conservative tracer cl through the aquitard system can be described by 1 c t d e 2 c z 2 v c t 2 c initial c f o r c s 3 c ub c constantconc 4 c lb n d e c z 0 where d e is the effective diffusion coefficient v is the average darcy velocity c is the mass concentration of the solute z is the distance and t is the time hendry et al 2011 cf is freshwater concentration in the pleistocene sediment cs is saltwater concentration in the holocene marine sediment cub is concentration of the upper boundary clb is concentration of the lower boundary n is the normal vector to the boundary d e is a crucial parameter for determining the diffusive transport of porewater in this paper d e values in aquitards in the jiangsu coastal regions are referenced from ge 2018 using the laboratory diffusion cell experiments van der kamp et al 1996 savoye et al 2006 the d e of cl in aquitard samples were measured at a depth of 33 55 m of 1 6 2 7 10 10 m2 s in the bohai coastal regions d e value of 6 10 10 m2 s was adopted based on the measurement on a g1 borehole sample and previous studies in tianjin han et al 2020 the calculation for the linear velocity of porewater is based on darcy s law using the laboratory penetration test on shallow aquitard samples at a pressure of 0 8 mpa hydraulic conductivity k for bohai and jiangsu coastal area was determined to be 9 10 10 and 1 8 10 9 m s respectively ge 2018 the k values in laizhou bay aquitard are in range of 2 5 6 7 10 9 m s han et al 1996 this research used the hydraulic conductivity values determined above as the initial for the simulation works in the respective areas during the simulation variation of parameters with time induced by the deformation of clayey aquitard was not considered which may also have an important influence on porewater transport the coastal plain is the regional discharge area in the north china plain due to the flat landscape an upward hydraulic gradient of approximately 2 was used in the simulation han et al 2020 equations 1 4 were solved using a finite element method which was implemented in comsol multiphysics li et al 2017b the domain is depth m width 1 m and free triangular is adopted for spatial discretization with the elements size of 1 m which is convergent for the simulation though much finer meshwork would improve the computational accuracy yan et al 2020 the relative change rate of the simulated values is less than 0 1 when they were compared to elements of size 0 5 and 1 m a total thickness of 40 70 m fine grained sediment average grain size of 45 56 μm yang et al 2014 ge 2018 since the late pleistocene was used for simulation to figure out the saline porewater evolution in the model the marine transgression and regression events throughout the holocene were simulated using a moving upper boundary to represent the deposition processes during the holocene sedimentation larsen et al 2017 the rate of movement was set as the sedimentation rate and undeposited cells were assigned as inactive transport cells to ensure they did not contribute to flow or cl transport after the sediment in a cell was deposited the cell was reactivated for solute transport han et al 2020 the detailed simulation method is as follows the column of holocene sediment was represented as multiple layers having a uniform thickness of 1 m just like a cfd model 20 layers were divided for the holocene sediment the bottom layer of the pleistocene sediment was set to active in the initial state and assigned an initial freshwater concentration of 100 mg l according to the deep fresh porewater the transport model was split into 20 successive time slices with the transgression time of 8 ka and the time of seawater withdrawal from the studied area referring to the changes of shoreline fig 1 xue 2009 the simulated concentration at the end of each time slice was used as the starting concentration for the subsequent time slice during the salinization period the initial cl concentration beyond average seawater was adopted eq 2 as the widespread underground brine in the coastal plain han et al 1996 in the freshening period the initial concentration of the reactive cell was assigned 100 mg l if however further salinization occurred brine cl concentration was assigned table 3 a constant concentration was set at the upper boundary equation 3 and outflow was set at the lower boundary to allow solute to diffuse out because of the non stable state of aquitard solute in this depth interval eq 4 while only constant concentration was set as the lower boundary for borehole lz08 at the depth of 150 m a deep aquifer to explain the diffusion from saline aquifer into adjacent aquitard table 3 the depth range of the holocene marine layer was estimated by field observation of marine shells in sediment and bottom depth of holocene layer in the coastal zone xu et al 2011 fig 2 input parameters based on the lithological distribution and the settings in these simulations are given in table 3 in the bohai sea coastal plain modeling results confirmed porewater in the marine layer are trapped holocene seawater with the onset time of 8 ka and once experienced evaporation table 3 indicating a dry climate in the middle holocene in china wang et al 2007 subsequently porewaters were flushed by freshwater for a period of 2 3 ka fig 7 after desalination the maximum cl concentration in cfd and g1 was reduced to below that of seawater the current underground brine in the bohai bay receded eastward fig 1 the cl depth profiles is more sensitive to the de parameter changes of de will significantly influence the peak cl value while the advection velocity variations would change the position of peak cl value the optimized de parameters are between 1 and 3 5 10 10 m2 s constrained by the transport time fig 7 diffusion is indicated as the predominant transport mechanism for porewater with a small upward velocity of 0 03 0 6 mm yr in natural conditions fig 7 a peclet number is often used to decide whether transport by advection should be considered as calculated from the flowing equation the peclet number p e v e d d e d i s t h e a v e r a g e p a r t i c l e d i a m e t e r m freeze and cherry 1979 is 0 01 1 1 10 5 1 confirming the dominant diffusion transport in aquitard however influenced by the over extraction of groundwater in the last 6 decades cl profiles in the g1 and lz12 boreholes were further modified the groundwater table monitoring showed that a large vertical hydraulic gradient of 22 40 was generated in the south of tianjin city 1968 1996 data which forced an obvious downward flow of shallow saline water wang 2004 also the extraction of brines in laizhou bay for salt production and aquaculture has begun for hundreds of years and has been more prevalent since the 1970 s han et al 1996 a downward velocity increasing from 36 mm yr at the brine funnel edge to 600 mm yr at the funnel center was observed and thus led to the decline of brine tds by 30 g l per year guan 2009 therefore in the period of t3 a downward velocity of 50 63 mm yr hydraulic gradient of 33 42 about 170 times of upward velocity was adopted the cl depth profile reasonably matched the observed values fig 7 g1 lz12 the peak position of cl dropped by about 6 m in the depressions of bohai bay i e g3 porewater showed continuous salinization even after the seawater receded evaporation is the cause of local high salinity brines of tds 100 g l in the bohai bay han et al 1996 using an upward velocity of 0 6 mm yr the simulated brine porewater occurred close to the ground surface with a maximum cl of 66 g l at end of t2 fig 7 g3 well mixing trend between brine water with cl of 66 g l and porewater li et al 2017a further proved the rationality of the upper boundary the saline deep aquitard porewater at a depth below 100 m is caused by the adjacent saline aquifer s salinity input the best fits indicated that aquifer at 130 150 m in laizhou bay lz08 borehole was intruded by seawater at 5 ka bp with an induced cl of 8600 mg l fig 7 this is consistent with the simulation conducted by li et al 2017b in hyyk borehole the intruded aquifer is possibly a paleo channel as much more coarse sediments in this depth interval the occurrence of multiple paleo channels in the laizhou bay miao 2014 would make the transport of saline water more complicated as these can act as preferred pathways for water transport between aquifers and the sea larsen et al 2017 seawater withdrawal from the studied borehole sites in jiangsu coastal plain was much later the paleo yellow river entered into the south yellow sea in ce 1128 1855 which forced the coastline to move east zhou et al 2014 a time of 1 ka was then applied for freshening fig 7 sy1 sy2 and hyqd although brine aquifer was not observed in this area at present the simulated results suggested that evaporated seawater with cl concentration of 27 g l ever existed this lower salinity relative to the north coastal plain may be resulted from warm and humid climate and the abundant surface waters which played an essential role of dilution 6 conclusions five deep borehole profiles of naturally occurring tracers cl br δ2h and δ18o were measured in aquitards in the china eastern coastal plain combined analysis of previous eight borehole profiles to define the salinity origin and transport time scales of porewater across the aquitard porewater salinity showed spatial consistency of vertical distribution that is the higher cl value was observed near the bottom of holocene sediment in most sites associated with holocene transgression and later porewater was partially flushed by freshwater during regression this is evidenced by cl and δ2h mixing model however porewater can show ongoing evaporation to be brine near ground surface in some depression zone i e g3 hyds characterized by high salinity and depleted water isotopes deep saline porewater depth 150 230 m was observed locally caused by the salinity input of adjacent aquifer where it is most likely a paleo channel in preference to seawater intrusion the chloride transport simulations using the 1 d modelling approach showed that cl distribution is controlled by alternating seawater and freshwater diffusion modelling results supported that diffusion is the dominant transport across aquitard with an upward velocity of 0 03 0 6 mm yr but indicated solute transport has also been affected by reversed advective flow in the areas where extensive pumping occurred in recent 60 years the downward porewater velocity of 50 mm yr and 63 mm yr were derived for g1 and lz12 boreholes stressing the significant influence of pumping on the porewater salinity distribution the simulations suggested that the initial marine water was trapped holocene seawater but experienced evaporation however due to the different geological and climatic conditions the underground brine showed different salinities across the region the rise of global sea level in the early holocene has been recognized all over the world the trapped seawater is still present in low permeability aquitard and leaches into adjacent sediments we emphasize that the redistribution of marine saltwater in the aquitard is a significant cause of groundwater salinization furthermore the saltwater resulting from seawater intrusion into the aquitard can also become a long term pollution source ancient paleo channels in particular would be used as a priority outlet resulting in seawater intrusion credit authorship contribution statement jing li conceptualization data curation formal analysis xulong gong
