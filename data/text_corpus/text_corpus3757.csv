18785,in the last two years the rapidly rising demand for lithium has exceeded supply resulting in a sharp increase in the price of the metal conventional electric driven membrane processes can separate li from divalent cations but there is virtually no commercial membrane that can efficiently and selectively extract li from a solution containing chemically similar ions such as na and k here we show that the different movement behavior of li ion within the sub nanometre channel leads to li ion selectivity and high transport rate using inexpensive negatively charged 2d subnanometer hydrous phyllosilicate channels with interlayer space of 0 43 nm in a membrane like morphology we observed that for an interlayer spacing of below 1 nm li ions move along the length of the channel by jumping between its two walls however for above 1 nm spacing the ions used only one channel wall to jump and travel molecular dynamic md simulation also revealed that ions within the nanochannel exhibit acceleration deceleration behavior experimental results showed that the nanochannels could selectively transport monovalent ions of li na and k while excluding other ions such as cl and ca2 with the selectivity ratios of 1 26 1 59 and 1 36 for li na li k and na k respectively which far exceed the mobility ratios in traditional porous ion exchange membranes the findings of this work provide researchers with not only a new understanding of ions movement behavior within subnanometer confined areas but also make a platform for the future design of ion selective membranes graphical abstract image 1 keywords subnanometer channels li ion selective membrane two dimensional materials lithium extraction vermiculite 1 introduction it is predicted that the supply of the energy critical element of lithium will soon fall below its continuously increasing demand which will render it a strategically influential element choubey et al 2017 the amount of li in seawater is estimated to be nearly 230 000 million tons almost 57000 times higher than its abundance on land yoshizuka et al 2006 however the low concentration of li and its coexistence with chemically similar ions such as na and k in seawater makes the extraction of li from this source very challenging extraction of li using membrane technology from seawater lakes or geothermal brine as secondary li resources is highly sought after particularly for fast growing industries such as electric vehicles and lithium ion batteries due to the poor monovalent selectivity of conventional membrane technologies such as nanofiltration or electrodialysis using cation exchange membranes they can only be used to concentrate li by removing all the divalent ions a membrane that could transport certain ions such as monovalent cations li na and k while excluding other ions would be highly valued for the design of a li selective nanochannel membrane the two parameters of nanochannel structure and chemistry must be adjusted carefully razmjou 2019 nanochannel dimensions i e interlayer spacing length and symmetric or asymmetric channel morphology along with the inner surface charge play a vital role in the selective transportation of li ions many comprehensive reviews have discussed the ion transport mechanisms in nanopores and nanochannels daiguji 2010 horike et al 2013 oener et al 2017 tagliazucchi and szleifer 2015 membrane driving force pressure or potential difference is also another key parameter that should be taken into account for a neutral nanochannel the channel dimension must be smaller than the li hydration diameter 0 76 nm otherwise the channel will not exhibit li selectivity 1 among alkali metal ions guo et al 2016 zhang et al 2018b it is reported that for neutral sub nanometre channels the main mechanism for small monovalent ions to move is based on the partial dehydration and loss of their hydration layers razmjou 2019 when the nanochannel surfaces hold negative charges the partial dehydration is not the only ion conductivity mechanism and the ions affinity to the functional groups also comes into play the channel dimension then can be higher than 0 76 nm playing with the design above parameters recently researchers examined a range of building blocks to prepare li ion selective membranes metal organic frameworks such as uio 66 zhang et al 2018a mop 18 jung et al 2008 zif 8 zhang et al 2018a zif 7 zhang et al 2018a and sulfonated hkust 1 guo et al 2016 have recently exhibited li ion selectivity mofs particularly when they are threaded with negative ligands revealed high li na or li k selectivities and great potential however stable defect free flexible mof thin film is a significant ongoing issue researchers have tried to oxidize graphene sheets go partially and stack them to create membranes with 2d nanochannels for precise ionic and molecular sieving in aqueous solution han et al 2013 joshi et al 2014 liu et al 2015 recently cseri et al 2018 prepared a mechanically robust and highly permselective anion exchange membranes based on go and polybenzimidazolium nanocomposite their membrane exhibited high ion exchange capacity 1 7 2 1 mmol g 1 with exceptional permselectivity up to 0 99 go membranes also showed li ion selectivity abraham et al 2017 joshi et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 however difficulty in reducing the interlayer spacing of graphene oxide membranes and maintaining this space during swelling when immersed in the aqueous solution have been considered the main challenges hindering potential ion filtration applications of graphene oxide membranes goh et al 2015 huang et al 2013 hung et al 2014 su et al 2014 sun et al 2016 creating li ion selective nanochannels on polymeric membranes such as pet wang et al 2018 wen et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a using ion irradiation and uv radiation is currently a lab scale process and requires expensive infrastructure although the proposed li ion selective membranes are promising there are several challenges that keep them from meeting the industry requirements the three major challenges are 1 scalability 2 high cost of the building blocks and 3 a lack of fundamental understanding li ion behavior in nanoconfined areas as mentioned ion transportation mechanisms inside nanochannels have been well studied however the mechanisms by which li ions show higher transportation rates and thus selectivity in some designed nanochannels than over na or k ions is not yet clear this uncertainty and poor understanding particularly with regards to dehydration energy barrier has resulted in contradictory conclusions and discussions therefore more experimental and theoretical explorations are needed to understand what dictates li ion to transport within the nanochannel at a higher rate than na or k the concept of this work is to exploit 2d nanofluidic vermiculite vct channels into a morphology which can be used to control ion transportation across the membrane selectively here vct is selected because it has significant advantages compared with go and other two dimensional structures vct with its extraordinary chemical and thermal stability is much more readily available and much less costly orooji et al 2017 it can be exfoliated easily in water via thermal heat treatment and ionic exchange as opposed to the exfoliation procedure of graphene and other 2d materials our novel and strategically designed membranes were produced from vastly available inexpensive vct minerals 20 usd kg from sigma aldrich and 20 cny kg from chinese suppliers to prepare vct membranes we introduced pressure assisted vacuum deposition techniques that can be easily scaled up recently shao et al 2015 demonstrated that such 2d nanofluidic channels could show superionic proton conductivity here we show for the first time another fascinating property of 2d nanofluidic vct channels selective transportation of li we also used molecular dynamic md simulation to understand the mechanism by which li ions transport through vct nanochannels the outcomes of this work provide researchers with a new understanding of li ions movement behavior within subnanometer confined areas and also make a platform for the future design of ion selective membranes 2 experimental 2 1 materials vermiculite vct cas no 0001318009 calcium chloride cacl2 97 potassium chloride kcl 99 sodium chloride nacl 99 5 and lithium chloride licl 99 were purchased from sigma aldrich hydrochloric acid hcl 37 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 35 and ethanol 96 were sourced from a local provider 3 methods details of vct membrane preparation nanofluidic device fabrication membrane monovalent cations conductivity measurement and analysis of desalination performance of vct membranes are presented in methods in supporting information a variety of techniques i e afm sem tem bet and xrd were used to characterize the membranes see supporting information for more details 4 results and discussions 4 1 preparation and characterization of li ion selective vct membrane in this work the exfoliation of vcts followed the approaches used by walker and garrett 1967 and obut and girgin 2002 briefly the exfoliation was performed based on a rapid thermal shock and subsequent several ion exchange steps and a final hydrogen peroxide treatment see fig s1a as shown in fig 1 a vct is known as the layered magnesium aluminosilicate compound each layer has a negative charge 1 4 mcm 2 and consists of one mg based octahedral sheet that is sandwiched between two tetrahedral silicate sheets valaskova and martynkova 2013 the substitutional al 3 cations in the tetrahedral sheets give rise to the negative charges on the layers these negative charges are balanced by cations between the layers during the thermal shock the interlayer water rapidly vaporizes and expands the crystals into an accordion like structure see fig 1b and c xrd and bet results exhibited in fig 1d and e revealed that the thermal shock at elevated temperature could destroy the vct structure the disappearance of xrd peaks in the 2Î¸ range of 5 15 which correspond to k and mg vct and hydration layers marcos et al 2009 alongside with a significant reduction in the bet surface area and bjh pore volume from 44 59 m2 g and 0 104 cm3 g at 900 c to 15 03 m2 g and 0 0108 cm3 g at 1000 c confirm the possibility of structural vct unit collapse orooji et al 2017 during the ionic exchange process the interlayer distances increase by replacing the interlayer cations such as na k and mg2 with li which has a larger hydration diameter during the final hydrogen peroxide treatment the oxygen evolution from its decomposition helps to exfoliate the vct layers further as can be seen in fig 1f the thickness of the structural unit two magnesium aluminosilicate layers plus an interlayer space is approximately 0 83 0 06 nm with interlayer space of 0 43 0 05 nm the values were obtained using an image processor software provided by the tem instrument the d spacing was calculated using xrd data and the bragg equation the inset image in fig 1f shows that the thermal and chemical exfoliation processing led to a light brown colloidal suspension of vct layers as has also been observed elsewhere shao et al 2015 the nanofluidic membrane can be readily prepared by reassembly of the exfoliated vct layers using different approaches including filtration dip coating spraying and solvent evaporation ballard and rideal 1983 shao et al 2015 in this work the filtration technique was used to stack the exfoliated 2d sheets see methods fig 2 a shows the flexible free standing vct membrane 1 mm thickness obtained by the vacuum filtration process sem and afm images in fig 2b show the cross section of our membrane with lamellar structure it appears that the membrane consists of a stack of 40 nm layers flakes such that each layer consists of many 0 83 nm structural units see fig 2c xrd results in fig 2d are attributed to the raw vct particles and our membrane as can be seen the absence of two strong peaks below 2Î¸ of 10 and the appearance of one peak around 6 which is attributed to the lithium intercalated vct indicate that the original interlayer cations mg2 k have been successfully exchanged by li following sessile drop technique used in our previous works orooji et al 2018 shirani et al 2017 the water contact angles of the vct membranes were measured it was observed that the water droplet disappeared immediately within a second after touching the membranes a broad definition of superhydrophilicity which is mostly referred to in the literature is achieving zero contact angles within the first 5 s razmjou et al 2011 therefore our membrane is considered as the superhydrophilic membrane the water uptake and swelling ratio were measured following our previous works with some amendments razmjou et al 2013a 2013b 2013c briefly a piece of the membrane 1 by 2 cm without pdms sandwiching was placed on a wet tissue to gradually absorb water molecules the sample was weighed every few mins until it reached saturation and thus its weight was unchanged the water uptake q of the membrane was calculated as q wt wd wd 100 where wt is the weight g of the wet membrane at the end of the experiment and wd is the weight 0 04 g of the initial dry sample before the test the sample did uptake water 50 of its dry weight the swelling ratio of the membrane was also calculated based on the volumetric changes of the sample after water uptake and it was found 30 it should point out here the pdms sandwiched sample showed insignificant swelling ratio as expected 4 2 li ion selectivity the electric field driven ion transport in vct nanochannel was analyzed by linear sweep voltammetry l s v using licl nacl kcl cacl2 solutions and an in house cell see fig s1b the ionic conductivity of the fabricated membrane can be estimated from the slope of the i v curves in the range of potentials within which no redox reactions can occur shao et al 2015 zhang et al 2018b as can be seen in fig 3 a the slope of i v curves remained zero for dry vct membrane and also when deionized water was used as the electrolytic the slope values reduced for hcl licl nacl and kcl and approached zero when cacl2 solution was used an insignificant number of ca2 divalent or cl anions were able to pass through the vct nanochannel as the independent movement of ion species allows the passage of current through the solution it should be noted that in the applied potential range 0 1 0 3 v electrolysis of water molecules cannot occur so any change in the i v curve is due to the transportation of the corresponding cations the figure also shows that the ion conductivity increases as the ion sizes reduce such that h and k showed the highest 0 1 s cm 1 and lowest 0 04 s cm 1 conductivity at 0 0001 m related electrolyte solutions respectively electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis is the most common ac technique used to characterize electrochemical properties ion conductivity of the membrane 2 3 in this technique the ohmic resistance of the cell can be extracted by applying an alternating current or voltage driving force and measuring the magnitude and phase of the cell voltage or current to determine the complex impedance of the system as can be seen in fig 3b and fig s2a nyquist plots of proposed membrane versus li ion concentration ranging from 0 0001 to 1 m using eis revealed that the ionic conductivity increases by increasing the electrolyte solutions currently there is no commercial synthetic membrane with atomic sized pores that can efficiently separate monatomic ions for instance li na and k with the same valence and similar sizes having such a membrane is highly demanded particularly for mineral extraction and ion batteries to examine the li ion selectivity of vct membranes the ion selectivity ratio of m i m j was calculated from the equation zhang et al 2018b below 1 i o n s e l e c t i v i t y r a t i o i m i c l 0 2 v i m j c l 0 2 v where m is a cation and i and j stand for li na and k at 0 2 v using the i v curves the selectivity ratios of li na li k and na k were calculated as 1 26 1 59 and 1 36 respectively these ratios are much greater than the corresponding mobility ratios in water for example the mobility ratio of na k in water is around 0 7 which is significantly smaller than the value for our vct membranes 1 36 the selectivity ratios of the binary ions were evaluated using icp ms as can be seen in table s1 the selectivity ratios are close to those calculated by i v curves and equation 1 fig s2b and table s2 show a comparison between the selectivity performance of vct membranes and similar techniques described in the literature as can be seen the vct membranes with 2d nanochannels showed either higher ion selectivity performance or a much simpler synthesis route table s3 also compares the alkali ion selectivity performance of vct membrane with other synthetic nanochannels apart from zif8 go aao membranes introduced in ref zhang et al 2018b which has similar ion selectivity performance but a complex expensive synthetic route our vct membranes showed significantly superior performance it should be noted that the zif8 go aao showed anion conductivity calculated ion mobility of 2 5 for cl zhang et al 2018b whereas vct membranes prevent the transport of anions it is well proven that ion conductivity normally increases with temperature the effect of electrolyte temperature up to 90 c on the vct membranes performance was studied in fig s3 as can be seen the performance of the membrane increased slightly without destroying the vct unit structure indicating high thermal stability shao et al also studied the effect of high temperature 500 c treatment on vct membrane shao et al 2015 they showed that the nanochannels of vct exhibit extraordinary thermal stability such that they can maintain their proton conduction function even after annealing at 500 c in air lack of thermal stability of available commercial polymeric membranes has limited their applications the effect of membrane orientation was examined to see if there is any ion transport perpendicular to the direction of reconstructed layers horizontal vs vertical ion transport see inset in fig 3c as shown in fig 3c ion flow is mainly along the membrane but it can also flow across it through defects in its structure although horizontal transportation of ions along the membrane is dominant vertical transport may be desired for applications such as water purification when a high effective membrane surface area is needed to increase footprint as shown in the inset image in fig 2a the vct membrane was bent for 24 h then tested to examine any mechanical tension induced structural damage no significant difference in the i v curves of the vct membrane before and after bending was observed refer to fig s4a the effect of membrane thickness on the ion transportation was also investigated in fig s4b results indicated that reducing the membrane thickness by half led to a marginal reduction in ion conductivity this indicates the vct membrane has good ion transportability during the selective transportation of ions there is a chance that some li na or k remain in the interlayer space and may result in a change in the degree of hydration for the cation this in turn could lead to a change in the interlayer spacing thus decreasing the performance of the membrane in order to determine if the membrane performance remained stable a test of transportation of na nacl 1 m over a number of hours was conducted this experiment was repeated four times samples were also immersed in a solution of nacl 1 m for six months and then tested as can be seen in fig s5a the membranes exhibited long term stability energy dispersive x ray edx microanalysis bruker nano berlin germany was performed on the 6 month vct membrane to examine na ion trace as can be seen in fig s5b the associated k peak was not observing confirming the pervious result the performance of vct membrane was also compared with its two commercial counterparts of nafion and cmi 7000s as shown in fig 3d at 1 m hcl the vct membrane portion conductivity is similar to that for a nafion membrane nafion membranes have exhibited ion mobility of divalent cations inside themselves okada et al 1998 and show very poor li ion selectivity see table s2 the ion conductivity of our 2d nanofluidic vct membranes at 0 1 m hcl is about 0 165 s cm 1 compared with that of graphene oxide membrane which is 0 075 at 0 1 m hcl the proton conductivities of commercial pems of nafion and cmi 7000s are also 0 18 and 0 075 at 0 1 m hcl the vct membrane has ease of fabrication and cost advantages over nafion and shows great potential for commercial implementation li concentration in different sources varies from 0 1 to 0 2 ppm for seawater yoshizuka et al 2006 to 18 2000 ppm for lakes geothermal and oilfield brines there are some reports of lithium concentration values of 4000 ppm for the brines choubey et al 2016 2017 using reverse osmosis ro or membrane distillation md systems to concentrate the brines the concentration can go further to a higher level of 25000 35000 ppm in this study the li extraction performance of vct membrane was reported based on the reduction in electrical conductivity ec due to the removal of li from a saline solution with a different concentration of licl 1000 8000 15000 25000 and 35000 ppm in an electrolysis cell see fig s1c with a different voltage of 3 12 v the volume of the three identical reservoirs in fig s1c was 60 cc each 20 cc for each measurement the sample solutions were diluted 3 times before ec measurement the final ec value was adjusted before reporting as shown in fig 3e the ec reduces over time for all of the licl concentrations tested results showed that the ec drop is more pronounced at higher concentrations of licl fig 3f presents the effect of the change in applied power density v as can be seen in the figure the extraction rate increased significantly as the voltage increased particularly at high licl concentration indicating a good efficiency for salt lakes li extraction similar experiments were performed for na and k see fig s1 d g also ec of permeates was measured for nacl feed solution with an initial concentration of 8000 ppm with 2 4 and 6 h electrodialysis see fig s1h as can be seen the diluted permeate ecs are almost half of the feed solutions as the volume of the two reservoirs 3 and 1 is twice the feed reservoir considering the fact that the ppm value of a sodium chloride solution happens to be very close to half of its conductivity value in millisiemens cm we performed a simple mass balance to confirm the results from the table in fig s1h after 4 h of electrodialysis the concentration of nacl in feed is around 500 ppm while that of the permeate is around 244 ppm considering that the feed volume reservoir is half of the permeate volume there is a near mass balance between feed and permeate 4 3 li ion transport mechanism and md simulation the proton conductivity of the vct membrane was measured using the l s v technique and apparatus which was shown in fig s1b see methods fig 4 a represents i v curves recorded at different ph different concentrations of hcl from the figure the higher the proton concentration is the higher the ion conductivity becomes and the higher the slope of the i v curve this higher conductivity at a higher concentration of ions was also observed for kcl nacl and licl solutions see fig s6 since the three electrolytes share the same anion cl the differences of the ionic currents in i v curves must be caused by the cations fig 4b shows the ph dependent proton conductivity of vct membrane in comparison with that of the bulk hcl solution the proton conductivity of bulk is directly proportional to the concentration of hcl at low ph the conductivity values of the membrane were similar to that of nanofluidic channels whereas at high ph the values deviated from the bulk behavior it seems that in the acidic regime the nanochannel conductivity above ph 5 was somewhat constant and was independent of the concentration of bulk this ph independent conductivity is a signature of surface charge governed transport shao et al 2015 and also is an indication of good sealing of vct membrane by pdms at high ph values basic regime the debye length near the negatively charged vct nanochannel is greater than the interlayer spacing between the tetrahedral silicate sheets therefore cations between the layers are the dominant charge carrier and the surface charge density determines their concentration inside the channels rather than bulk electrolyte concentration salieb beugelaar et al 2009 this greater than bulk proton conductivity behavior was also observed for licl nacl and nacl see fig s7 md simulation was performed to understand the effect of vct nanochannel dimensions and external electric field density on the li ion transportation mechanism in this work all molecular dynamics simulations were performed using non equilibrium in the nvt ensemble at a temperature of 298 15 k maintained using the nose hoover thermostat please refer to supporting information for more details the simulation revealed that reducing the nanochannel dimensions from nanometre to subnanometer scale resulted in two interesting phenomena a reduction in water density number of h2o nm3 and a change in li ion jumping transportation behavior from two surface to one surface charge governed transport mode studies using density functional theory revealed that strong electric fields have a significant impact on the structure and energetics of small li water clusters daub et al 2015 in the absence of an electric field the li nh2o forms a symmetry of n 4 tetrahedral energy minimum structure according to daub et al 2015 the small electric field strength is sufficient to break the symmetry into an asymmetric planar cluster with n 3 resulting in the partial dehydration of li ions a similar transition was also observed for the 6 coordinated cluster li 6h2o to 5 and 4 coordinated clusters at field strengths of 0 2 v Ã¥ and 0 3 v Ã¥ respectively as can be seen in fig 4c and d the confinement effect resulted in a substantial reduction in the water density in the first hydration shell of li the second hydration shell also nearly disappeared in agreement with daub et al 2015 the increase in applied potential from 0 to 2 v nm resulted in the reduction in coordination number and rdf peaks and higher partial dehydration degree it is well proven that saline water expels its salt content upon freezing nebbia and menozzi 1968 it is also reported that in a small nanoscale confined area water exhibits layered 2d structuring and can form ordered ice like phases fumagalli et al 2018 karna et al 2018 winartoyamamoto and yasuoka 2017 this might be the reason for increasing the migration rate of li ions towards the wall surfaces of vct nanochannels as can be seen in fig 5 b d f and h the water density and number of layers inside the nanochannel increases when the channel dimension increases from 0 4 to 1 2 nm reduction in water density could facilitate the li ion movement and lead to higher ion mobility water molecular dipoles also aligned with the electric field such that oxygen negative end of the dipole faced the cathode positive while hydrogen positive ends of the dipole faced the anode negative our md simulation revealed that li ions transportation behavior within the vct nanochannels with sub nanometre dimension is different from that of nanometre dimension 1 nm channels when the nanochannel dimension is below 1 nm the li ions conduct via the two surface charge governed transport mechanism li ions jump from one of the nanochannel walls to the opposite wall while they move in the electric field direction depicted in fig 5a as migration from left to right along the nanochannel however when the channel dimension was increased to 1 2 nm the li ions moved by hopping only along one surface of the nanochannel one surface charge governed transport mechanism see fig 5g the reason may be related to the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking of charge regulated surfaces majee et al 2018 when two surfaces are equally charged similarly to our vct nanochannels their symmetry can become spontaneously broken with decreasing the inter surface distance their charge densities could then differ in magnitude and even in sign the origin of spontaneous symmetry breaking of charge on vct surface is a competition between the adsorption of li ions from the solution to the surface and the interaction between the adsorbed ions already on the surface or the functional groups existing on the nanochannel wall surface the li ions moved along the length of nanochannel due to an external electric field from left to right toward the negative electrode while the ions are attracted toward the vct surfaces due to the potential of the electrical double layer edl the potential is at a maximum at the vct surface and reduces exponentially to the zeta potential Æº between the stern layer and the diffuse layer for a vct nanochannel with dimensions smaller than 1 nm the absorbed li ions on one of the surfaces spontaneously break the charge symmetry resulting in the reduction in charge density potential of the surface s edl and even sign since the edl s potential on the opposite surface is higher the ions will be attracted to that opposite surface when they jump this spontaneous breaking of charge symmetry of the surfaces repeats so that the li ions can move along the structure by jumping from side to side until they finally exit the nanochannel when the channel size increased to above 1 nm the influence of the potential of the opposite surface diminished to the point that it is not strong enough to attract the li ion resulting in the one surface charge governed transport mechanism this phenomenon can also be explained based on the lennard jones potential 1924 table s4 shows the lennard jones potential parameters of oxygen and lithium in the table Ï is the finite distance at which the inter particle potential is zero and is 2 87 and 3 11 Ã¥ for li and surface o respectively therefore the inter particle potential of lithium and oxygen at 2 99 Ã¥ is zero fig 6a shows the rdf of available oxygen on the vct surface and li as can be seen in the figure the first unstable and sharp peak appeared at 1 86 Ã¥ 2 87 Ã¥ for a 0 4 nm vct nanochannel see inset in fig 6a which is an indication of the repulsive force between li ions and oxygens of vct surface this spontaneous repulsive force reduces as the channel dimension increased and reached a level that li ions were no longer able to jump between the surfaces so hoped only along one surface it was also discovered that the transport behavior of li ions inside vct nanochannel not only changes in sub nanometre vct channel but also has a different velocity distribution and gradient fig 6 b and 6c shows that the velocity of the li ions inside vct nanochannel was zero in the absence of an external electric field 0 v nm meaning no ions could diffuse into the membrane in the presence of an external electric field li ions exhibited an almost linear velocity gradient and acceleration at the entry to the nanochannel followed by a sudden drop acceleration deceleration behavior change in the velocity gradient is very large for sub nanometre 0 4 nm vct nanochannel fig 6b as voltage increases whereas it is much smaller for 1 2 nm vct nanochannel fig 6c due to higher water fluidity and density see fig s9 for velocity distribution of li in 0 6 and 0 8 nm vct nanochannel the sudden drop in the velocity gradient might be related to a phenomenon known as the ion enrichment and ion depletion effect of nanochannels pu et al 2004 increasing the applied potential and power density of the electrical field voltage beyond a certain value between the two sides of the nanochannel causes the depletion of ions in the entrance at y 1 5 nm in fig 6b and 6c and their enrichment on the other side at y 4 5 nm resulting in an increase in polarization the accumulation of li ions at y 4 5 nm creates a strong repulsive force that substantially reduces the velocity of incoming ions figure s10is the results of our md simulation to investigate the effect of change in power water density on the diffusion coefficient and ion flux of cations in the vct membrane with 0 4 and 0 8 nm interlayer spacing as can be seen increasing the power density enhanced not only the li transport rate but also the ca2 transport rate inside the vct nanochannel however providing such a high power density for ca2 ions to overcome the dehydration and crosslinking energy barriers are practically challenging and might not be economically viable therefore for the li extraction application at relatively low power density our vct membrane exhibited great potential the li ions velocity is compared with those of na k and ca2 in fig 6d and fig s11 the higher li ions velocity might be related to higher ion mobility of li according to wen et al 2016 the partially dehydrated li ions have more compact structures shorter width of the hydration shell than na k and ca2 ions and thus exhibit higher ion mobilities and conductivities through nanochannels 5 conclusion the industry is urgently seeking new and efficient membranes to extract li from brine and seawater to address the fast growing lithium demand here we showed that the reassembling of exfoliated two dimensional vct sheets could lead to flexible free standing membranes which can selectively conduct li while excluding other anions or divalent cations using md simulation we discovered that when the nanochannel dimension is below 1 nm li ions jump from one of the nanochannel walls to the opposite wall while they move in the electric field direction however when the channel dimension was increased to 1 2 nm the li ions move by hopping only along one surface of the nanochannel the inexpensive vct membrane introduced in this work exhibited either a significantly higher ion selectivity or more cost effective fabrication process when compared to similar works reported in the literature this provides an opportunity for many and varied commercial applications of this advanced high tech membrane although in this work the performance of the membrane was evaluated for lithium recovery it might also be considered for other applications such as lithium based batteries and supercapacitors sensors solvent

18785,in the last two years the rapidly rising demand for lithium has exceeded supply resulting in a sharp increase in the price of the metal conventional electric driven membrane processes can separate li from divalent cations but there is virtually no commercial membrane that can efficiently and selectively extract li from a solution containing chemically similar ions such as na and k here we show that the different movement behavior of li ion within the sub nanometre channel leads to li ion selectivity and high transport rate using inexpensive negatively charged 2d subnanometer hydrous phyllosilicate channels with interlayer space of 0 43 nm in a membrane like morphology we observed that for an interlayer spacing of below 1 nm li ions move along the length of the channel by jumping between its two walls however for above 1 nm spacing the ions used only one channel wall to jump and travel molecular dynamic md simulation also revealed that ions within the nanochannel exhibit acceleration deceleration behavior experimental results showed that the nanochannels could selectively transport monovalent ions of li na and k while excluding other ions such as cl and ca2 with the selectivity ratios of 1 26 1 59 and 1 36 for li na li k and na k respectively which far exceed the mobility ratios in traditional porous ion exchange membranes the findings of this work provide researchers with not only a new understanding of ions movement behavior within subnanometer confined areas but also make a platform for the future design of ion selective membranes graphical abstract image 1 keywords subnanometer channels li ion selective membrane two dimensional materials lithium extraction vermiculite 1 introduction it is predicted that the supply of the energy critical element of lithium will soon fall below its continuously increasing demand which will render it a strategically influential element choubey et al 2017 the amount of li in seawater is estimated to be nearly 230 000 million tons almost 57000 times higher than its abundance on land yoshizuka et al 2006 however the low concentration of li and its coexistence with chemically similar ions such as na and k in seawater makes the extraction of li from this source very challenging extraction of li using membrane technology from seawater lakes or geothermal brine as secondary li resources is highly sought after particularly for fast growing industries such as electric vehicles and lithium ion batteries due to the poor monovalent selectivity of conventional membrane technologies such as nanofiltration or electrodialysis using cation exchange membranes they can only be used to concentrate li by removing all the divalent ions a membrane that could transport certain ions such as monovalent cations li na and k while excluding other ions would be highly valued for the design of a li selective nanochannel membrane the two parameters of nanochannel structure and chemistry must be adjusted carefully razmjou 2019 nanochannel dimensions i e interlayer spacing length and symmetric or asymmetric channel morphology along with the inner surface charge play a vital role in the selective transportation of li ions many comprehensive reviews have discussed the ion transport mechanisms in nanopores and nanochannels daiguji 2010 horike et al 2013 oener et al 2017 tagliazucchi and szleifer 2015 membrane driving force pressure or potential difference is also another key parameter that should be taken into account for a neutral nanochannel the channel dimension must be smaller than the li hydration diameter 0 76 nm otherwise the channel will not exhibit li selectivity 1 among alkali metal ions guo et al 2016 zhang et al 2018b it is reported that for neutral sub nanometre channels the main mechanism for small monovalent ions to move is based on the partial dehydration and loss of their hydration layers razmjou 2019 when the nanochannel surfaces hold negative charges the partial dehydration is not the only ion conductivity mechanism and the ions affinity to the functional groups also comes into play the channel dimension then can be higher than 0 76 nm playing with the design above parameters recently researchers examined a range of building blocks to prepare li ion selective membranes metal organic frameworks such as uio 66 zhang et al 2018a mop 18 jung et al 2008 zif 8 zhang et al 2018a zif 7 zhang et al 2018a and sulfonated hkust 1 guo et al 2016 have recently exhibited li ion selectivity mofs particularly when they are threaded with negative ligands revealed high li na or li k selectivities and great potential however stable defect free flexible mof thin film is a significant ongoing issue researchers have tried to oxidize graphene sheets go partially and stack them to create membranes with 2d nanochannels for precise ionic and molecular sieving in aqueous solution han et al 2013 joshi et al 2014 liu et al 2015 recently cseri et al 2018 prepared a mechanically robust and highly permselective anion exchange membranes based on go and polybenzimidazolium nanocomposite their membrane exhibited high ion exchange capacity 1 7 2 1 mmol g 1 with exceptional permselectivity up to 0 99 go membranes also showed li ion selectivity abraham et al 2017 joshi et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 however difficulty in reducing the interlayer spacing of graphene oxide membranes and maintaining this space during swelling when immersed in the aqueous solution have been considered the main challenges hindering potential ion filtration applications of graphene oxide membranes goh et al 2015 huang et al 2013 hung et al 2014 su et al 2014 sun et al 2016 creating li ion selective nanochannels on polymeric membranes such as pet wang et al 2018 wen et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a using ion irradiation and uv radiation is currently a lab scale process and requires expensive infrastructure although the proposed li ion selective membranes are promising there are several challenges that keep them from meeting the industry requirements the three major challenges are 1 scalability 2 high cost of the building blocks and 3 a lack of fundamental understanding li ion behavior in nanoconfined areas as mentioned ion transportation mechanisms inside nanochannels have been well studied however the mechanisms by which li ions show higher transportation rates and thus selectivity in some designed nanochannels than over na or k ions is not yet clear this uncertainty and poor understanding particularly with regards to dehydration energy barrier has resulted in contradictory conclusions and discussions therefore more experimental and theoretical explorations are needed to understand what dictates li ion to transport within the nanochannel at a higher rate than na or k the concept of this work is to exploit 2d nanofluidic vermiculite vct channels into a morphology which can be used to control ion transportation across the membrane selectively here vct is selected because it has significant advantages compared with go and other two dimensional structures vct with its extraordinary chemical and thermal stability is much more readily available and much less costly orooji et al 2017 it can be exfoliated easily in water via thermal heat treatment and ionic exchange as opposed to the exfoliation procedure of graphene and other 2d materials our novel and strategically designed membranes were produced from vastly available inexpensive vct minerals 20 usd kg from sigma aldrich and 20 cny kg from chinese suppliers to prepare vct membranes we introduced pressure assisted vacuum deposition techniques that can be easily scaled up recently shao et al 2015 demonstrated that such 2d nanofluidic channels could show superionic proton conductivity here we show for the first time another fascinating property of 2d nanofluidic vct channels selective transportation of li we also used molecular dynamic md simulation to understand the mechanism by which li ions transport through vct nanochannels the outcomes of this work provide researchers with a new understanding of li ions movement behavior within subnanometer confined areas and also make a platform for the future design of ion selective membranes 2 experimental 2 1 materials vermiculite vct cas no 0001318009 calcium chloride cacl2 97 potassium chloride kcl 99 sodium chloride nacl 99 5 and lithium chloride licl 99 were purchased from sigma aldrich hydrochloric acid hcl 37 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 35 and ethanol 96 were sourced from a local provider 3 methods details of vct membrane preparation nanofluidic device fabrication membrane monovalent cations conductivity measurement and analysis of desalination performance of vct membranes are presented in methods in supporting information a variety of techniques i e afm sem tem bet and xrd were used to characterize the membranes see supporting information for more details 4 results and discussions 4 1 preparation and characterization of li ion selective vct membrane in this work the exfoliation of vcts followed the approaches used by walker and garrett 1967 and obut and girgin 2002 briefly the exfoliation was performed based on a rapid thermal shock and subsequent several ion exchange steps and a final hydrogen peroxide treatment see fig s1a as shown in fig 1 a vct is known as the layered magnesium aluminosilicate compound each layer has a negative charge 1 4 mcm 2 and consists of one mg based octahedral sheet that is sandwiched between two tetrahedral silicate sheets valaskova and martynkova 2013 the substitutional al 3 cations in the tetrahedral sheets give rise to the negative charges on the layers these negative charges are balanced by cations between the layers during the thermal shock the interlayer water rapidly vaporizes and expands the crystals into an accordion like structure see fig 1b and c xrd and bet results exhibited in fig 1d and e revealed that the thermal shock at elevated temperature could destroy the vct structure the disappearance of xrd peaks in the 2Î¸ range of 5 15 which correspond to k and mg vct and hydration layers marcos et al 2009 alongside with a significant reduction in the bet surface area and bjh pore volume from 44 59 m2 g and 0 104 cm3 g at 900 c to 15 03 m2 g and 0 0108 cm3 g at 1000 c confirm the possibility of structural vct unit collapse orooji et al 2017 during the ionic exchange process the interlayer distances increase by replacing the interlayer cations such as na k and mg2 with li which has a larger hydration diameter during the final hydrogen peroxide treatment the oxygen evolution from its decomposition helps to exfoliate the vct layers further as can be seen in fig 1f the thickness of the structural unit two magnesium aluminosilicate layers plus an interlayer space is approximately 0 83 0 06 nm with interlayer space of 0 43 0 05 nm the values were obtained using an image processor software provided by the tem instrument the d spacing was calculated using xrd data and the bragg equation the inset image in fig 1f shows that the thermal and chemical exfoliation processing led to a light brown colloidal suspension of vct layers as has also been observed elsewhere shao et al 2015 the nanofluidic membrane can be readily prepared by reassembly of the exfoliated vct layers using different approaches including filtration dip coating spraying and solvent evaporation ballard and rideal 1983 shao et al 2015 in this work the filtration technique was used to stack the exfoliated 2d sheets see methods fig 2 a shows the flexible free standing vct membrane 1 mm thickness obtained by the vacuum filtration process sem and afm images in fig 2b show the cross section of our membrane with lamellar structure it appears that the membrane consists of a stack of 40 nm layers flakes such that each layer consists of many 0 83 nm structural units see fig 2c xrd results in fig 2d are attributed to the raw vct particles and our membrane as can be seen the absence of two strong peaks below 2Î¸ of 10 and the appearance of one peak around 6 which is attributed to the lithium intercalated vct indicate that the original interlayer cations mg2 k have been successfully exchanged by li following sessile drop technique used in our previous works orooji et al 2018 shirani et al 2017 the water contact angles of the vct membranes were measured it was observed that the water droplet disappeared immediately within a second after touching the membranes a broad definition of superhydrophilicity which is mostly referred to in the literature is achieving zero contact angles within the first 5 s razmjou et al 2011 therefore our membrane is considered as the superhydrophilic membrane the water uptake and swelling ratio were measured following our previous works with some amendments razmjou et al 2013a 2013b 2013c briefly a piece of the membrane 1 by 2 cm without pdms sandwiching was placed on a wet tissue to gradually absorb water molecules the sample was weighed every few mins until it reached saturation and thus its weight was unchanged the water uptake q of the membrane was calculated as q wt wd wd 100 where wt is the weight g of the wet membrane at the end of the experiment and wd is the weight 0 04 g of the initial dry sample before the test the sample did uptake water 50 of its dry weight the swelling ratio of the membrane was also calculated based on the volumetric changes of the sample after water uptake and it was found 30 it should point out here the pdms sandwiched sample showed insignificant swelling ratio as expected 4 2 li ion selectivity the electric field driven ion transport in vct nanochannel was analyzed by linear sweep voltammetry l s v using licl nacl kcl cacl2 solutions and an in house cell see fig s1b the ionic conductivity of the fabricated membrane can be estimated from the slope of the i v curves in the range of potentials within which no redox reactions can occur shao et al 2015 zhang et al 2018b as can be seen in fig 3 a the slope of i v curves remained zero for dry vct membrane and also when deionized water was used as the electrolytic the slope values reduced for hcl licl nacl and kcl and approached zero when cacl2 solution was used an insignificant number of ca2 divalent or cl anions were able to pass through the vct nanochannel as the independent movement of ion species allows the passage of current through the solution it should be noted that in the applied potential range 0 1 0 3 v electrolysis of water molecules cannot occur so any change in the i v curve is due to the transportation of the corresponding cations the figure also shows that the ion conductivity increases as the ion sizes reduce such that h and k showed the highest 0 1 s cm 1 and lowest 0 04 s cm 1 conductivity at 0 0001 m related electrolyte solutions respectively electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis is the most common ac technique used to characterize electrochemical properties ion conductivity of the membrane 2 3 in this technique the ohmic resistance of the cell can be extracted by applying an alternating current or voltage driving force and measuring the magnitude and phase of the cell voltage or current to determine the complex impedance of the system as can be seen in fig 3b and fig s2a nyquist plots of proposed membrane versus li ion concentration ranging from 0 0001 to 1 m using eis revealed that the ionic conductivity increases by increasing the electrolyte solutions currently there is no commercial synthetic membrane with atomic sized pores that can efficiently separate monatomic ions for instance li na and k with the same valence and similar sizes having such a membrane is highly demanded particularly for mineral extraction and ion batteries to examine the li ion selectivity of vct membranes the ion selectivity ratio of m i m j was calculated from the equation zhang et al 2018b below 1 i o n s e l e c t i v i t y r a t i o i m i c l 0 2 v i m j c l 0 2 v where m is a cation and i and j stand for li na and k at 0 2 v using the i v curves the selectivity ratios of li na li k and na k were calculated as 1 26 1 59 and 1 36 respectively these ratios are much greater than the corresponding mobility ratios in water for example the mobility ratio of na k in water is around 0 7 which is significantly smaller than the value for our vct membranes 1 36 the selectivity ratios of the binary ions were evaluated using icp ms as can be seen in table s1 the selectivity ratios are close to those calculated by i v curves and equation 1 fig s2b and table s2 show a comparison between the selectivity performance of vct membranes and similar techniques described in the literature as can be seen the vct membranes with 2d nanochannels showed either higher ion selectivity performance or a much simpler synthesis route table s3 also compares the alkali ion selectivity performance of vct membrane with other synthetic nanochannels apart from zif8 go aao membranes introduced in ref zhang et al 2018b which has similar ion selectivity performance but a complex expensive synthetic route our vct membranes showed significantly superior performance it should be noted that the zif8 go aao showed anion conductivity calculated ion mobility of 2 5 for cl zhang et al 2018b whereas vct membranes prevent the transport of anions it is well proven that ion conductivity normally increases with temperature the effect of electrolyte temperature up to 90 c on the vct membranes performance was studied in fig s3 as can be seen the performance of the membrane increased slightly without destroying the vct unit structure indicating high thermal stability shao et al also studied the effect of high temperature 500 c treatment on vct membrane shao et al 2015 they showed that the nanochannels of vct exhibit extraordinary thermal stability such that they can maintain their proton conduction function even after annealing at 500 c in air lack of thermal stability of available commercial polymeric membranes has limited their applications the effect of membrane orientation was examined to see if there is any ion transport perpendicular to the direction of reconstructed layers horizontal vs vertical ion transport see inset in fig 3c as shown in fig 3c ion flow is mainly along the membrane but it can also flow across it through defects in its structure although horizontal transportation of ions along the membrane is dominant vertical transport may be desired for applications such as water purification when a high effective membrane surface area is needed to increase footprint as shown in the inset image in fig 2a the vct membrane was bent for 24 h then tested to examine any mechanical tension induced structural damage no significant difference in the i v curves of the vct membrane before and after bending was observed refer to fig s4a the effect of membrane thickness on the ion transportation was also investigated in fig s4b results indicated that reducing the membrane thickness by half led to a marginal reduction in ion conductivity this indicates the vct membrane has good ion transportability during the selective transportation of ions there is a chance that some li na or k remain in the interlayer space and may result in a change in the degree of hydration for the cation this in turn could lead to a change in the interlayer spacing thus decreasing the performance of the membrane in order to determine if the membrane performance remained stable a test of transportation of na nacl 1 m over a number of hours was conducted this experiment was repeated four times samples were also immersed in a solution of nacl 1 m for six months and then tested as can be seen in fig s5a the membranes exhibited long term stability energy dispersive x ray edx microanalysis bruker nano berlin germany was performed on the 6 month vct membrane to examine na ion trace as can be seen in fig s5b the associated k peak was not observing confirming the pervious result the performance of vct membrane was also compared with its two commercial counterparts of nafion and cmi 7000s as shown in fig 3d at 1 m hcl the vct membrane portion conductivity is similar to that for a nafion membrane nafion membranes have exhibited ion mobility of divalent cations inside themselves okada et al 1998 and show very poor li ion selectivity see table s2 the ion conductivity of our 2d nanofluidic vct membranes at 0 1 m hcl is about 0 165 s cm 1 compared with that of graphene oxide membrane which is 0 075 at 0 1 m hcl the proton conductivities of commercial pems of nafion and cmi 7000s are also 0 18 and 0 075 at 0 1 m hcl the vct membrane has ease of fabrication and cost advantages over nafion and shows great potential for commercial implementation li concentration in different sources varies from 0 1 to 0 2 ppm for seawater yoshizuka et al 2006 to 18 2000 ppm for lakes geothermal and oilfield brines there are some reports of lithium concentration values of 4000 ppm for the brines choubey et al 2016 2017 using reverse osmosis ro or membrane distillation md systems to concentrate the brines the concentration can go further to a higher level of 25000 35000 ppm in this study the li extraction performance of vct membrane was reported based on the reduction in electrical conductivity ec due to the removal of li from a saline solution with a different concentration of licl 1000 8000 15000 25000 and 35000 ppm in an electrolysis cell see fig s1c with a different voltage of 3 12 v the volume of the three identical reservoirs in fig s1c was 60 cc each 20 cc for each measurement the sample solutions were diluted 3 times before ec measurement the final ec value was adjusted before reporting as shown in fig 3e the ec reduces over time for all of the licl concentrations tested results showed that the ec drop is more pronounced at higher concentrations of licl fig 3f presents the effect of the change in applied power density v as can be seen in the figure the extraction rate increased significantly as the voltage increased particularly at high licl concentration indicating a good efficiency for salt lakes li extraction similar experiments were performed for na and k see fig s1 d g also ec of permeates was measured for nacl feed solution with an initial concentration of 8000 ppm with 2 4 and 6 h electrodialysis see fig s1h as can be seen the diluted permeate ecs are almost half of the feed solutions as the volume of the two reservoirs 3 and 1 is twice the feed reservoir considering the fact that the ppm value of a sodium chloride solution happens to be very close to half of its conductivity value in millisiemens cm we performed a simple mass balance to confirm the results from the table in fig s1h after 4 h of electrodialysis the concentration of nacl in feed is around 500 ppm while that of the permeate is around 244 ppm considering that the feed volume reservoir is half of the permeate volume there is a near mass balance between feed and permeate 4 3 li ion transport mechanism and md simulation the proton conductivity of the vct membrane was measured using the l s v technique and apparatus which was shown in fig s1b see methods fig 4 a represents i v curves recorded at different ph different concentrations of hcl from the figure the higher the proton concentration is the higher the ion conductivity becomes and the higher the slope of the i v curve this higher conductivity at a higher concentration of ions was also observed for kcl nacl and licl solutions see fig s6 since the three electrolytes share the same anion cl the differences of the ionic currents in i v curves must be caused by the cations fig 4b shows the ph dependent proton conductivity of vct membrane in comparison with that of the bulk hcl solution the proton conductivity of bulk is directly proportional to the concentration of hcl at low ph the conductivity values of the membrane were similar to that of nanofluidic channels whereas at high ph the values deviated from the bulk behavior it seems that in the acidic regime the nanochannel conductivity above ph 5 was somewhat constant and was independent of the concentration of bulk this ph independent conductivity is a signature of surface charge governed transport shao et al 2015 and also is an indication of good sealing of vct membrane by pdms at high ph values basic regime the debye length near the negatively charged vct nanochannel is greater than the interlayer spacing between the tetrahedral silicate sheets therefore cations between the layers are the dominant charge carrier and the surface charge density determines their concentration inside the channels rather than bulk electrolyte concentration salieb beugelaar et al 2009 this greater than bulk proton conductivity behavior was also observed for licl nacl and nacl see fig s7 md simulation was performed to understand the effect of vct nanochannel dimensions and external electric field density on the li ion transportation mechanism in this work all molecular dynamics simulations were performed using non equilibrium in the nvt ensemble at a temperature of 298 15 k maintained using the nose hoover thermostat please refer to supporting information for more details the simulation revealed that reducing the nanochannel dimensions from nanometre to subnanometer scale resulted in two interesting phenomena a reduction in water density number of h2o nm3 and a change in li ion jumping transportation behavior from two surface to one surface charge governed transport mode studies using density functional theory revealed that strong electric fields have a significant impact on the structure and energetics of small li water clusters daub et al 2015 in the absence of an electric field the li nh2o forms a symmetry of n 4 tetrahedral energy minimum structure according to daub et al 2015 the small electric field strength is sufficient to break the symmetry into an asymmetric planar cluster with n 3 resulting in the partial dehydration of li ions a similar transition was also observed for the 6 coordinated cluster li 6h2o to 5 and 4 coordinated clusters at field strengths of 0 2 v Ã¥ and 0 3 v Ã¥ respectively as can be seen in fig 4c and d the confinement effect resulted in a substantial reduction in the water density in the first hydration shell of li the second hydration shell also nearly disappeared in agreement with daub et al 2015 the increase in applied potential from 0 to 2 v nm resulted in the reduction in coordination number and rdf peaks and higher partial dehydration degree it is well proven that saline water expels its salt content upon freezing nebbia and menozzi 1968 it is also reported that in a small nanoscale confined area water exhibits layered 2d structuring and can form ordered ice like phases fumagalli et al 2018 karna et al 2018 winartoyamamoto and yasuoka 2017 this might be the reason for increasing the migration rate of li ions towards the wall surfaces of vct nanochannels as can be seen in fig 5 b d f and h the water density and number of layers inside the nanochannel increases when the channel dimension increases from 0 4 to 1 2 nm reduction in water density could facilitate the li ion movement and lead to higher ion mobility water molecular dipoles also aligned with the electric field such that oxygen negative end of the dipole faced the cathode positive while hydrogen positive ends of the dipole faced the anode negative our md simulation revealed that li ions transportation behavior within the vct nanochannels with sub nanometre dimension is different from that of nanometre dimension 1 nm channels when the nanochannel dimension is below 1 nm the li ions conduct via the two surface charge governed transport mechanism li ions jump from one of the nanochannel walls to the opposite wall while they move in the electric field direction depicted in fig 5a as migration from left to right along the nanochannel however when the channel dimension was increased to 1 2 nm the li ions moved by hopping only along one surface of the nanochannel one surface charge governed transport mechanism see fig 5g the reason may be related to the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking of charge regulated surfaces majee et al 2018 when two surfaces are equally charged similarly to our vct nanochannels their symmetry can become spontaneously broken with decreasing the inter surface distance their charge densities could then differ in magnitude and even in sign the origin of spontaneous symmetry breaking of charge on vct surface is a competition between the adsorption of li ions from the solution to the surface and the interaction between the adsorbed ions already on the surface or the functional groups existing on the nanochannel wall surface the li ions moved along the length of nanochannel due to an external electric field from left to right toward the negative electrode while the ions are attracted toward the vct surfaces due to the potential of the electrical double layer edl the potential is at a maximum at the vct surface and reduces exponentially to the zeta potential Æº between the stern layer and the diffuse layer for a vct nanochannel with dimensions smaller than 1 nm the absorbed li ions on one of the surfaces spontaneously break the charge symmetry resulting in the reduction in charge density potential of the surface s edl and even sign since the edl s potential on the opposite surface is higher the ions will be attracted to that opposite surface when they jump this spontaneous breaking of charge symmetry of the surfaces repeats so that the li ions can move along the structure by jumping from side to side until they finally exit the nanochannel when the channel size increased to above 1 nm the influence of the potential of the opposite surface diminished to the point that it is not strong enough to attract the li ion resulting in the one surface charge governed transport mechanism this phenomenon can also be explained based on the lennard jones potential 1924 table s4 shows the lennard jones potential parameters of oxygen and lithium in the table Ï is the finite distance at which the inter particle potential is zero and is 2 87 and 3 11 Ã¥ for li and surface o respectively therefore the inter particle potential of lithium and oxygen at 2 99 Ã¥ is zero fig 6a shows the rdf of available oxygen on the vct surface and li as can be seen in the figure the first unstable and sharp peak appeared at 1 86 Ã¥ 2 87 Ã¥ for a 0 4 nm vct nanochannel see inset in fig 6a which is an indication of the repulsive force between li ions and oxygens of vct surface this spontaneous repulsive force reduces as the channel dimension increased and reached a level that li ions were no longer able to jump between the surfaces so hoped only along one surface it was also discovered that the transport behavior of li ions inside vct nanochannel not only changes in sub nanometre vct channel but also has a different velocity distribution and gradient fig 6 b and 6c shows that the velocity of the li ions inside vct nanochannel was zero in the absence of an external electric field 0 v nm meaning no ions could diffuse into the membrane in the presence of an external electric field li ions exhibited an almost linear velocity gradient and acceleration at the entry to the nanochannel followed by a sudden drop acceleration deceleration behavior change in the velocity gradient is very large for sub nanometre 0 4 nm vct nanochannel fig 6b as voltage increases whereas it is much smaller for 1 2 nm vct nanochannel fig 6c due to higher water fluidity and density see fig s9 for velocity distribution of li in 0 6 and 0 8 nm vct nanochannel the sudden drop in the velocity gradient might be related to a phenomenon known as the ion enrichment and ion depletion effect of nanochannels pu et al 2004 increasing the applied potential and power density of the electrical field voltage beyond a certain value between the two sides of the nanochannel causes the depletion of ions in the entrance at y 1 5 nm in fig 6b and 6c and their enrichment on the other side at y 4 5 nm resulting in an increase in polarization the accumulation of li ions at y 4 5 nm creates a strong repulsive force that substantially reduces the velocity of incoming ions figure s10is the results of our md simulation to investigate the effect of change in power water density on the diffusion coefficient and ion flux of cations in the vct membrane with 0 4 and 0 8 nm interlayer spacing as can be seen increasing the power density enhanced not only the li transport rate but also the ca2 transport rate inside the vct nanochannel however providing such a high power density for ca2 ions to overcome the dehydration and crosslinking energy barriers are practically challenging and might not be economically viable therefore for the li extraction application at relatively low power density our vct membrane exhibited great potential the li ions velocity is compared with those of na k and ca2 in fig 6d and fig s11 the higher li ions velocity might be related to higher ion mobility of li according to wen et al 2016 the partially dehydrated li ions have more compact structures shorter width of the hydration shell than na k and ca2 ions and thus exhibit higher ion mobilities and conductivities through nanochannels 5 conclusion the industry is urgently seeking new and efficient membranes to extract li from brine and seawater to address the fast growing lithium demand here we showed that the reassembling of exfoliated two dimensional vct sheets could lead to flexible free standing membranes which can selectively conduct li while excluding other anions or divalent cations using md simulation we discovered that when the nanochannel dimension is below 1 nm li ions jump from one of the nanochannel walls to the opposite wall while they move in the electric field direction however when the channel dimension was increased to 1 2 nm the li ions move by hopping only along one surface of the nanochannel the inexpensive vct membrane introduced in this work exhibited either a significantly higher ion selectivity or more cost effective fabrication process when compared to similar works reported in the literature this provides an opportunity for many and varied commercial applications of this advanced high tech membrane although in this work the performance of the membrane was evaluated for lithium recovery it might also be considered for other applications such as lithium based batteries and supercapacitors sensors solvent

with increasing the optical path length nowell and hoignÃ© 1992a a shallow and open water reservoir was recommended for solar chlorine process jasper and sedlak 2013 therefore solar chlorine process provides an effective option for mc lr control especially for decentralized and point of use potable water treatment this study was designed to test whether or not that would be possible the photolysis of free chlorine hocl and ocl pka 7 5 were highly wavelength dependent solar wavelengths overlap with the absorption spectra of free chlorine in the range of 290 400 nm fig s7 solar driven photolysis of free chlorine generates hydroxyl radicals ho and reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl and cl2 and ground state atomic oxygen o 3p the latter of which was only generated under the irradiation wavelengths of 320 400 nm and further converted to ozone o3 through reacting with dissolved oxygen cooper et al 2007 o3 in particular is strong oxidant for pollutants removal it should be noted that uv254 chlorine process cannot produce o3 the primary reactive species generated from free chlorine photolysis is shown in reactions 1 6 buxton and subhani 1972 1 hocl ocl hv ho o cl Î» 400

tend to attack the conjugated dienes in mc lr molecules reacting selectively with electron donors but which exact species chlorine radicals cl or chlorine dimer radical anions cl2 contributes most to mc lr removal is unknown furthermore solar photolysis of free chlorine yields o3 reactions 5 and 6 which is absent in uv chlorine processing o3 oxidizes mc lr quickly with a reaction rate constant of 4 1 105 m 1s 1 at ph 8 0 onstad et al 2007 oxidizing conjugated dienes and aromatic ring structures chang et al 2015 but o3 is also very reactive toward natural organic matter in water whether o3 generated from free chorine photolysis contributes significantly to mc lr degradation in natural waters remains unknown the objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of solar chlorine processing for mc lr degradation and detoxification the specific aims were 1 to identify the role of oxidative species in mc lr elimination and to clarify the mc lr degradation pathway involved 2 to investigate the kinetics of mc lr degradation in the solar chlorine process with different chlorine doses and at different ph alkalinity natural organic matter content and bromide content 3 to evaluate the potential for mc lr removal using natural sunlight and the dbps formed and 4 to assess the toxicity of the degradation byproducts 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals mc lr 95 was

used without further purification 2 2 simulated solar and natural sunlight irradiation simulated solar irradiation was provided by a q sun xenon test chamber xe 1 solar simulator equipped with a daylight q optical filter 290 nm the total absolute irradiance spectrum of the solar simulator over the wavelength range 290 800 nm was measured using an ocean optics usb 4000 spectrometer and is shown in fig s7 the light intensity in the range of 290 400 nm which overlapped with the absorbance of hocl ocl was fixed at 35 5 w m 2 experiments were undertaken under headspace free conditions in 30 0 ml sealed quartz vials 5 cm in diameter and thermostated at 25 c in a circulating water bath fig s7b natural sunlight experiments were performed in may 2018 in guangzhou south china samples were irradiated by placing them on the roof of the laboratory building and the solutions were not temperature controlled 2 3 experimental procedures water samples 30 0 ml containing 1 0 Î¼m mc lr were buffered to ph 6 0 7 0 or 8 0 using 10 mm phosphate buffer or to ph 9 0 using 10 mm borate buffer in some experiments nitrobenzene or benzoic acid was added as a radical probe tert butyl alcohol t buoh or isopropanol ip was added as a radical quencher or hco3 nom or br were added to the mc lr solutions the experiments were initiated by adding free chlorine up to 42 0 Î¼m while exposing the vials to the simulated sunlight the samples were well stirred by a magnetic stirrer at pre determined time intervals 1 0 ml samples were collected any residual chlorine was quenched by adding 0 1 mg sodium sulfite and the levels of residual mc lr byproducts and toxicity were quantified for comparison experiments with solar irradiation alone and chlorination alone were also conducted following the same procedures the average dissolved oxygen concentration was measured to be 6 8 mg l 1 natural solar chlorine experiments were conducted using three natural samples designated as ym hs and xcq spiked with 1 0 Î¼m mc lr the samples were collected from three rivers in china s guangdong province and their properties are listed in table s1 the experiments under natural sunlight followed the same procedures as those under simulated sunlight except that the water samples were irradiated without ph adjustment dbp formation tests were performed using the ym sample after 5 min of treatment solar chlorination and the solar chlorine process samples were subjected to post chlorination by adding 10 mg l 1 of free chlorine and incubating for 72 h at 25 c all of the experiments were conducted in triplicate the relative standard deviation of the three replicates was less than 5 in all cases 2 4 rate constant determination the second order rate constants of cl and cl2 with mc lr were examined using a laser flash photolysis technique this technology has been used to measure rate constants for the reactions of cl and cl2 with mono and dichloramine li et al 2018 the experimental solution contained 10 mm na2s2o8 2 mm or 1 m nacl and 0 05 1 mm mc lr without ph adjustment ph 3 9 irradiated na2s2o8 solutions generate sulfate radicals so4 which react rapidly with cl and converted it to cl or cl2 with an equilibrium constant of 1 4 105 m 1 buxton et al 1998 cl2 exhibits strong absorption at 340 nm with a molar absorption coefficient of 8800 m 1 cm 1 alegre et al 2000 the rate constant of cl or cl2 s reaction with mc lr was estimated by monitoring absorbance at 340 nm as a surrogate for the decay rate of cl2 details are illustrated in the texts s1 and s2 in the si additionally bromine s reaction rate constant with mc lr was determined by a competition kinetics method employing phenol as the competitor the details are described in text s3 2 5 concentrations of reactive species the steady state concentrations of ho and cl were determined by employing nb and ba as probe compounds nowell and hoignÃ© 1992b more details are presented in text s4 in the si o3 concentrations were measured using cinnamic acid as the probe compound with details described in text s5 in the si forsyth et al 2013 additionally the concentrations of ho cl cl2 and clo were predicted using a kintecus model version 5 55 as illustrated in text s6 and table s2 such modelling has been used for predicting radical concentration in a few advanced oxidation processes parker et al 2016 2 6 analytical methods mc lr concentrations were measured with a u3000 high performance liquid chromatograph thermo scientific equipped with a 238 nm photodiode array detector using an agilent zorbax sb c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm 3 5 Î¼m particle size the mobile phase consisted of a acetonitrile and b 0 1 phosphoric acid in ultrapure water the method s detection limit for mc lr concentration was 0 05 Î¼m and the recovery was over 95 free chlorine was measured using the diethyl p phenylene diamine ferrous titration method apha 2005 doc concentrations were measured using a shimadzu toc vcph analyzer the analysis of chlorite chlorate nitrite nitrate and bromide was performed on a dionex ics 900 ion chromatograph equipped with an anionic column dionex ionpac as23 mc lr byproducts were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer equipped with a water acquity uplc beh c18 column 2 1 mm 100 mm 1 7 Î¼m particle size positive ion mode was applied and the mass spectrometry was at a source voltage of 2 3 kv a source temperature of 120 c a cone voltage of 40 v and a scan range of 50 1100 analysis of the mass spectra relied on masslynx 4 1 software the toxicity of the by products was evaluated using an elisa method qian et al 2015 a microcystin kit beacon analytical systems inc based on colorimetric protein phosphatase pp2a inhibition assay was used as illustrated in text s7 in the si the relative inhibition of pp2a was used to estimate detoxification it was computed using equation 7 7 inhibition l c l t l c 100 where l c and lt refer to the absorbances of a pp2a negative control and of samples containing mc lr after t minutes of treatment respectively thms haas and hans were analyzed using an agilent 7890a gas chromatograph equipped with an hp 5 fused silica capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm i d j w scientific according to usepa methods 551 1 and 552 3 the detection limits for thms haas and hans were all lower than 0 2 Î¼g l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 reaction rate constants of cl and cl2 with mc lr the rate constants for the reactions of cl and cl2 with mc lr were obtained using laser flash photolysis cl2 was generated via the reaction of sulfate radical with chloride as shown in text s1 the cl2 concentrations were determined based on absorption at 340 nm with an absorption coefficient of 8800 m 1 cm 1 the pseudo first order rate constant was calculated by monitoring the decay of transient absorbance at 340 nm alegre et al 2000 fig s1a illustrates the decay of cl2 absorption intensity and fig s1b shows the cl2 decay rate increased linearly with increasing initial mc lr concentration from 0 05 to 0 2 mm the second order rate constant between cl2 and mc lr was thus calculated to be 5 58 0 42 107 m 1s 1 the rate constant for the reaction of cl with mc lr was estimated to be 2 25 0 07 1010 m 1s 1 text s2 the reactivity of cl towards mc lr was three orders of magnitude higher than that of cl2 the rate constant of mc lr with cl was twice of that with ho 1 1 1010 m 1 s 1 again implying greater reactivity this is the first published report of these rate constants 3 2 kinetics of mc lr degradation in the solar chlorine process mc lr degradation rate in the solar chlorine process was faster than with solar irradiation or chlorination alone as shown in fig 1 mc lr degradation obeyed pseudo first order degradation kinetics in all three treatment processes fig s8 solar irradiation alone barely degraded mc lr less than 1 0 within 5 min which is consistent with previously published observations wÃ¶rmer et al 2010 with a 42 0 Î¼m dose of chlorine 3 0 mg l 1 cl2 at ph 7 0 chlorination degraded 61 4 of the mc lr in 5 min the solar chlorine treatment however demonstrated 94 6 degradation of mc lr in the same period the observed first order degradation rate k obs of mc lr was 1 1 10 2 s 1 in the solar chlorine process which was 2 8 fold higher than that in chlorination alone 2 6 10 3 s 1 solar chlorine treatment with a 21 0 Î¼m chlorine dose had a k obs for mc lr removal similar to that of chlorination with 42 0 Î¼m chlorine dose the solar chlorine process uses half as much chlorine for the same result by chlorination there is clearly synergy between the irradiation and free chlorine based on previous studies of mc lr degradation in chlorination zhang et al 2016b ho oxidation he et al 2015 and ozonation chang et al 2015 the susceptible reaction sites of mc lr in solar chlorine process were a relatively large amino acid moiety adda and methyl dehydroalanine mdha moiety on cyclic peptides fig s6 to identify the moieties primarily responsible for the observed mc lr degradation in the solar chlorine process the degradation kinetics of the two key functional groups in the mc lr molecule were examined as shown in fig 1 right sorbic acid mirrors the conjugated dienes of adda side chains 2 acetoamidoacrylic acid emulates the mdha groups onstad et al 2007 the degradation rate of sorbic acid k obs 1 2 10 1 s 1 in the solar chlorine process was about one order of magnitude higher than that of mc lr fig 1 it was found that higher concentrations of residual free chlorine existed in the sorbic acid solution than in the mc lr solution fig s9a the higher levels of free chlorine will result in higher yields of reactive species ho rcs and o3 during the solar driven photolysis as an example after solar chlorine treatment for 5 min at ph 7 0 the accumulative o3 concentration in the sorbic acid solution 6 1 10 8 m was 3 8 fold of that in the mc lr solution 1 6 10 8 m fig s9b meanwhile the rate constant of o3 toward sorbic acid 9 6 105 m 1s 1 was also higher than mc lr 4 1 105 m 1s 1 onstad et al 2007 similar to mc lr the degradation rates for sorbic acid in solar chlorine treatment were 1 6 to 2 0 fold faster than those in chlorination alone while solar irradiation alone had negligible removal a 42 0 Î¼m chlorine dose in the solar chlorine process degraded sorbic acid five times as fast 1 2 10 1 s 1 as 2 acetoamidoacrylic acid 2 4 10 2 s 1 these results suggest that the conjugated diene structure in the adda moieties is more reactive than the olefins in the mdha groups 3 3 relative roles of light free chlorine ho rcs and o3 equation 8 expresses mc lr degradation in the solar chlorine process as possibly attributed to direct solar photolysis as well as oxidation by chlorine ho rcs and o3 8 d m c l r d t k s o l a r k c h l o r i n e c h l o r i n e k h o h o k c l c l k c l 2 c l 2 k o 3 o 3 k o t h e r s m c l r where mc lr is the concentration of mc lr k solar is the pseudo first order rate constant of mc lr s degradation via solar photolysis k chlorine k ho k cl k cl2 and k o3 are the apparent second order rate constants between mc lr and free chlorine ho cl cl2 and o3 respectively table 1 the measured concentrations of reactive species are summarized in table 2 the ho concentrations were at level of 10 13 m which were 3 fold of cl level the o3 concentrations were above 10 8 m at ph ranged 7 0 to 9 0 and the highest o3 concentrations reached 2 8 10 8 m at ph 8 0 the predicted radicals concentrations showed good matches with the measured ones the predicted cl2 levels were used in equation 2 the individual contribution of each species to mc lr removal was calculated separately as illustrated in text s8 the ph dependent contribution by reactive species is shown in fig 2 the highest k obs was at ph 8 0 k obs 1 5 10 2 s 1 followed by ph 7 0 1 1 10 2 s 1 mc lr degradation was much slower at ph 6 0 7 6 10 3 s 1 and at ph 9 0 5 9 10 3 s 1 this observation is different from the results of uv chlorine treatment using 254 nm irradiation which showed decreasing mc lr degradation rates with increasing ph from 6 0 to 9 0 zhang et al 2019 this difference is attributable to the generation of o3 in the solar chlorine process whereas o3 was absent in the uv254 chlorine process at ph 8 0 free chlorine ho and rcs contributed to 5 6 7 8 and 5 2 of the mc lr degradation o3 contributed 76 1 at ph 6 0 by contrast the contributions were 35 0 from free chlorine 33 3 from ho 22 3 from rcs and only 7 3 from o3 previous study has demonstrated elevating ph enhanced free chlorine photolysis and this ph dependent is more significant at a longer wavelength yin et al 2018 therefore ph affects the levels of the reactive species and thus the degradation rate of mc lr free chlorine is the predominant agent in mc lr removal at ph 6 0 free chlorine exists as hocl and ocl pka 7 5 hocl reacts with mc lr 1 16 102 m 1s 1 more quickly than ocl 6 78 m 1s 1 acero et al 2005 additionally increasing ph accelerates the photodecay rate of free chlorine the sunlight induced decay rate of free chlorine is 1 0 h 1 at ph 6 0 which increases to 6 3 h 1 at ph 9 0 cooper et al 2007 as a result the contribution of free chlorine reduces significantly from 35 0 at ph 6 0 to 1 9 at ph 9 0 o3 contributed 52 7 of the mc lr degradation at ph 7 0 in the solar chlorine process the rate constant of o3 with mc lr has been reported to be 4 1 105 m 1s 1 onstad et al 2007 the quantum yield of o 3p from free chlorine photolysis was 0 07 0 08 and 0 28 at 254 313 and 365 nm respectively and o 3p can quickly react with o2 to generate o3 buxton and subhani 1972 the presence of o3 about 10 8 m clearly enhanced mc lr degradation o3 s contribution was greater at ph 7 0 9 0 than at ph 6 0 elevating ph from 6 0 to 8 0 resulted in a larger the proportion of ocl enhancing o3 generation the highest o3 concentration was observed at ph 8 0 around 2 8 10 8 m contributing greatly to mc lr degradation whereas mc lr degradation rate at ph 9 5 9 10 3 s 1 was 40 of that at ph 8 1 5 10 2 s 1 the lower k obs for mc lr degradation at ph 9 compared to ph 8 was attributed to the lower ozone level fig s5 indicates o3 concentration at ph 9 0 1 1 10 8 m was also 40 of that at ph 8 0 2 8 10 8 m after 5 min of solar chlorine process it can be inferred that increasing ph from 8 0 to 9 0 increased the proportion of ocl from 65 to 97 which enhanced o 3p scavenging and thus reduced o3 generation reaction 9 zhou et al 2014 9 o p 3 o c l clo 2 k 9 9 4 10 9 m 1 s 1 ho contributed 14 3 of the mc lr removal at ph 7 0 the photolysis of free chlorine generated ho through reactions 1 and 2 and it has been reported that mc lr is oxidized by ho with the rate constant of 1 1 1010 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 antoniou et al 2008 as is shown in table 2 the steady state concentrations of ho ranged around the level of 10 13 m the contribution of ho was reduced by 17 2 at phs from 6 0 to 9 0 ho is scavenged by ocl 8 8 109 m 1s 1 17 6 times faster than by hocl 5 0 108 m 1s 1 chuang et al 2017 therefore a higher ph resulted in a lower contribution from ho rcs can also contribute to mc lr degradation in the solar chlorine process as discussed at section 3 1 the second order rate constants of mc lr with cl and cl2 were estimated to be 2 3 1010 and 5 58 107 m 1s 1 respectively the measured cl concentration 10 14 m and the predicted cl2 level 10 13 m thus suggest that the contributions of cl and cl2 to mc lr degradation were 9 6 and 0 1 respectively as with ho phs from 6 0 to 9 0 reduced the contribution of cl by 11 6 additionally other unidentified reactive species also contributed up to 4 9 of the observed mc lr elimination clo about 10 10 m is reported to react with methoxybenzene and phenolic compounds at around 108 m 1s 1 and may also contribute to mc lr removal guo et al 2017 to further confirm the roles of reactive species quenching experiments were conducted in which 50 mm tert butanol t buoh or 250 mm isopropanol was added to the solutions the levels of radicals in the presence of scavengers are listed in table 2 ho and cl and o 3p can be quenched effectively by t buoh at 6 0 108 3 0 108 and 3 8 107 m 1 s 1 respectively wu et al 2017 zhou et al 2014 accordingly adding 50 mm t buoh scavenged 99 2 of ho 96 3 of cl and 62 6 of o 3p table s4 patton et al 2017 the drop of o 3p resulted in an equivalent decrease in o3 production this incomplete scavenging of reactive species could account for the 56 3 inhibition of mc lr degradation k obs 4 8 10 3 s 1 as shown in fig s9 250 mm ip reduced the mc lr degradation rate by 89 4 to 1 4 10 3s 1 primarily due to the entirely scavenging of reactive species except for free chlorine a similar effect of the two quenchers on modelling adda moiety was also observed fig s9 3 4 products the mc lr degradation products from the solar chlorine process were identified by liquid chromatography coupled with a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer operating in positive mode mc lr degradation products were detected primarily at p795 p835 p1011 p1029 p1047 and their isomers table s5 the detailed ms ms spectra and chromatograms are provided in figs s12 s18 hydroxyl mc lr is mainly generated from ho and o3 attacks on the double bond of mc lr diol mc lrs were the predominant products designated as p1029a b c d 995 5 34 1029 5 corresponding to the chemical formula c49h76n10o14 four distinct peaks were observed at m z 1029 5612 to 1029 5640 suggesting at least 4 different pathways for p1029 formation then dehydration at two adjacent hydroxyl groups of diol mc lr p1029 produced p1011 1029 5 18 1011 5 p1011 m z 1011 5521 can also be generated via ho and o3 attack on aromatic rings 995 5 16 1011 5 chloro mc lr products were also observed p1047 m z 1047 5206 may form through chlorination or the addition of rcs to the double bonds of mc lr 995 5 35 17 1047 5 alternatively diol mc lr enhances the electron density of mc lr and promote chlorine adduction and dehydration to generate p1047 1029 5 35 17 1047 5 meanwhile the addition of rcs to aromatic rings forms monochloro mc lr p1029 e 995 5 35 1 1029 5 corresponding to m z 1029 5216 with a formula of c49h73n10o12cl zhang et al 2016a chloro mc lr p1047 and p1029e can be degraded to p1011 via photo induced dechlorination and further hydroxylation li and blatchley iii 2009 finally aldehyde mc lr p795 m z 795 3923 and ketone mc lr p835 m z 835 4315 were generated through the cleavage of the c4 c5 or c6 c7 bonds of adda moiety several products such as p570 p331 p242 formed eventually via hydrolysis and peptide bond breaking fig 3 proposes a scheme for mc lr degradation in the solar chlorine process beyond non radical chlorination rcs may promote chloro mc lr formation via both electrophilic attack on unsaturated bonds and hydrogen abstraction reactions chloro mc lr can then be transformed into hydroxyl mc lr through the cleavage of c cl or n cl bonds by photochemical dechlorination and hydroxylation li and blatchley iii 2009 based on the intermediates identified adda and mdha moieties were the major reactive sites which is consistent with kinetics described in section 3 2 those two moieties contain unsaturated bonds which tend to be attacked by both reactive radicals and o3 onstad et al 2007 the cleavage of hydroxylated mc lr then results in the formation of aldehyde mc lr and carboxyl mc lr further mc lr molecule destruction occurs through the cleavage of peptide bonds fig 4 a illustrates the evolution of mc lr intermediates in the solar chlorine process using relative peak intensities diol mc lr products dominate the highest intensity of p1029b was obtained at 6 min followed by a gradual decrease with time p835 clearly increased within 4 min followed by a quick decrease p795 was generated gradually at 2 min notably p835 and p795 was not observed in uv254 chlorine process zhang et al 2019 less peak abundance of chloro mc lr p1029e and p1047 was observed than of hydroxyl mc lr probably due to photolytic dechlorination the evolution of mc lr degradation products under irradiation and in the dark were distinctly different as fig s10 shown p1029b reached a maximum within 2 min in dark chlorination and the remained stable and the intensity of p1029b was about 30 fold higher than under irradiation but little p835 was formed in the dark these results suggest that more degradation pathways were available in the solar chlorine process than in chlorination alone confirming the important roles of ho rcs and o3 in mc lr removal 3 5 toxicity detoxification was evaluated based on the inhibition of pp2a activity fig 4b indicates that the solar chlorine process can detoxify mc lr substantially better than chlorination or solar irradiation alone after 10 min the relative inhibition of pp2p activity reduced by 77 0 in solar chlorine treatment which was much larger than the sum of chlorination alone reduced by 46 7 and sunlight irradiation alone increased by 11 1 the relative toxicity by the solar chlorine treatment dropped from 67 8 after 1 min to 23 3 after 5 min although solar chlorine process enhanced the detoxification of mc lr some mc lr transformation products are still toxic the toxicity caused by treated mc lr solution could result from chlorinated or hydroxyl mclr by products zong et al 2013 since adda groups are responsible for mc lr s toxicity he et al 2016 the destruction of adda moieties was presumably involved the degradation products suggest that hydroxylation of diene structures on adda moieties occurred with the participation of reactive radicals within the first 5 min of solar chlorine treatment that process contributed to mc lr detoxification effectively then with longer treatment parent mc lr was further destroyed to limit the production of toxic products such as aldehyde mc lr and ketone mc lr so the solar chlorine process exhibited synergistic detoxification as well as degradation 3 6 mc lr elimination and dbp formation in natural waters experiments were also conducted using surface water samples spiked with 1 0 Î¼m mc lr under natural sunlight solar chlorine treatment again exhibited better mc lr degradation than with either natural sunlight or chlorination alone fig 5 a taking ym water as an example the k obs was 6 5 10 3 s 1 in the solar chlorine process much higher than the 1 5 10 5 s 1 with solar irradiation alone and the 1 3 10 3 s 1 observed with chlorination but compared to ultrapure water mc lr degradation was reduced by 26 1 52 5 in the three natural waters tested the xcq sample had a higher ph at 7 6 than the other two water samples ph both about 7 2 which is beneficial for mc lr degradation higher mc lr degradation rate was observed in natural solar chlorine process compared to the simulated solar chlorine treatment due to the uv fluence at 290 400 nm of the natural solar light 41 8 w m 2 was higher than that of the simulated solar light 35 5 w m 2 see fig s7 hco3 nom and br can all affect mc lr removal efficiency the three natural water samples contained 4 2 15 0 mg l 1 of hco3 2 4 5 0 mg c l 1 of nom and 30 Î¼g l 1 of br all of which might be expected to influence mc lr degradation in the solar chlorine process therefore separate experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of these three compounds on mc lr degradation fig s11 shows the k obs decreased by 27 3 in the presence of 50 mg l 1 hco3 mainly because of the scavenging of ho and cl by hco3 wu et al 2017 meanwhile 5 mg c l 1 of srnom reduced the mc lr degradation rate by 41 4 due to competition between the nom and mc lr for free chlorine o3 and ho table s3 bromide on the other hand greatly enhanced mc lr degradation the k obs increased to 2 1 10 2 s 1 in the presence of 2 5 Î¼m bromide and to 2 7 10 2 s 1 with 5 0 Î¼m bromide this enhancement could be ascribed to the formation of free bromine hobr obr via bromide reacting with free chlorine bousher et al 1986 the apparent second order rate constant between hobr obr and mc lr was determined to be 1 3 104 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 which is two orders of magnitude greater than the hocl ocl rate constant table 1 hobr photolysis yields reactive bromine species such as br bro and br2 clbr radicals can also be formed from bromide s reacting with rcs cheng et al 2018 but the bromide ion in the three natural waters tested was less than 0 4 Î¼m so overall the observed mc lr degradation in real waters was reduced in comparison with ultrapure water but still more than 85 8 mc lr degradation was achieved during the first 5 min of irradiation disinfection by products dbps form when chlorine is used the dbps formation were estimated using ym water spiked with 1 0 Î¼m mc lr for 5 min of treatment solar chlorination and solar chlorine process after 5 min of solar chlorine treatment mc lr concentration reduced from 1 0 to 0 1 Î¼m and free chlorine concentration was less than 0 3 mg l 1 the treated samples were then dosed with 10 mg l 1 free chlorine for post chlorination and incubated for 72 h fig 5b shows that the solar chlorine process generated 30 9 less thms 24 9 less haas and 44 4 less tcnm than dark chlorination the ho cl and o3 generated through chlorine photolysis may alter nom s properties reducing dbps formation previous research suggested solar chlorine treatment led to higher dbps yields compared to chlorination alone young et al 2018 the different results may attribute to the different water source and treatment procedure the solar chlorine treatment followed by post chlorination generated 0 8 Î¼g l 1 of hans whereas 0 4 Î¼g l 1 of hans generated in chlorination scheme the enhanced hans formation may have been due to reaction of amino groups in the mc lr with rcs zhang et al 2015 overall the solar chlorine process produced dbp levels meeting chinese drinking water standards in terms of both thms and haas concentrations less than 70 Î¼g l 1 the formation of chlorite clo2 chlorate clo3 and bromate bro3 was also assessed after 5 min of reaction chlorite and bromate formation was below the detection limit 0 02 mg l 1 in the three processes the formation of chlorate was observed in chlorination 0 04 mg l 1 and in the solar chlorine process 0 11 mg l 1 in the solar chlorine process o 3p reacted with ocl to form chlorite 9 4 109 m 1s 1 which was further oxidized to chlorate 1 59 1010 m 1s 1 buxton and subhani 1972 overall these chlorate values were below the guidelines of drinking water in china 0 70 mg l 1 for chlorite and for chlorate 4 conclusions the solar chlorine process effectively degrades mc lr a 42 Î¼m chlorine dose and 5 min of solar irradiation can degrade 94 6 of the mc lr in ultrapure water and over 85 8 in natural waters the mc lr degradation rate in the solar chlorine process is 2 8 fold faster than in chlorination alone with a 42 Î¼m chlorine dose in ultrapure water besides free chlorine ho cl and o3 also contribute to mc lr degradation in the combined process the second order rate constants for cl and cl2 reacting with mc lr are 2 25 0 07 1010 and 5 58 0 42 107 m 1s 1 respectively the best mc lr removal is observed at ph 8 0 and o3 was the predominant oxidizing component at that ph the double bonds on adda side chain and mdha moieties are the main attack sites on mc lr molecule additionally the cleavage of adda moieties contributes to the detoxification of mc lr overall solar chlorine purification is a good alternative to uv254 based advanced oxidation processes it effectively removes mc lr saves chlorine and forms fewer dbps solar chlorine is cheap and simple technology suitable for practical drinking water treatment especially for rural areas where algal blooming is feared the solar chlorine reactor design requires careful attention to potential impacts of optical path length of solar irradiation on mc lr degradation

18786,microcystin lr mc lr generated by cyanobacteria is a potent toxin threatening human health in this study the kinetics and mechanisms of mc lr elimination from drinking water under solar irradiation with free chlorine the solar chlorine process was evaluated the rate of mc lr degradation was dramatically enhanced in the solar chlorine process 1 1 10 2 s 1 compared with chlorination alone 2 6 10 3 s 1 or solar irradiation alone 1 2 10 4 s 1 with a free chlorine dose of 42 Î¼m 3 0 mg l 1 as cl2 the enhancement was due to the presence of hydroxyl radicals reactive chlorine species rcs and ozone during free chlorine photolysis the second order rate constants of cl and cl2 reacting with mc lr were determined to be 2 25 0 07 1010 and 5 58 0 42 107 m 1s 1 respectively cl was the major rcs contributing to mc lr elimination the highest mc lr degradation rate was observed at ph 8 0 free chlorine ho cl and o3 together accounted for almost 95 of the mc lr elimination hydroxyl and chloro mc lr were generated in the process followed by dechlorination dehydration and cleavage of cyclic structures in mc lr aldehyde and ketone mc lr byproducts were also observed the destruction of dienes led to a great reduction in mc lr s toxicity mc lr removal in natural water samples under natural sunlight irradiation with free chlorine was demonstrated with limited formation of disinfection byproducts the solar chlorine process is an energy efficient approach for mc lr control especially suitable for rural areas or where algal blooming threatens graphical abstract image 1 keywords microcystin lr solar water purification chlorination reactive chlorine species water treatment toxicity 1 introduction microcystin lr mc lr is a widespread cyanotoxin which threatens the environment and human health harke et al 2016 mc lr is a potent hepatoxin inhibiting protein phosphatase 1 and 2a activity resulting in liver injury or even cancer preece et al 2017 the world health organization recommends an mc lr concentration of less than 1 0 Î¼g l 1 in the finished drinking water mc lr is a cyclic heptapeptide connected by peptide bonds fig s6 in the supporting information si it is hardly removed in conventional drinking water coagulation sedimentation and filtration westrick et al 2010 making it quite challenging to meet the who s recommendation when treating algae laden water he et al 2016 chlorination can degrade mc lr but its elimination strongly depends on the chlorine dosage reaction time and ph acero et al 2005 at a free chlorine to mc lr molar ratio of 20 1 the apparent second order rate constants for mc lr removal at ph 6 is 127 8 m 1s 1 but that decreases to 91 5 at ph 7 33 1 at ph 8 and to 6 8 m 1s 1 at ph 9 acero et al 2005 thus a high chlorine dose and or a long reaction time is needed to achieve efficient mc lr removal at the alkaline ph often encountered with mc lr contamination bullerjahn et al 2016 more chlorine and longer reaction times can enhance the production of disinfection by products dbps chu et al 2017 recent studies have found that ultraviolet uv irradiation at 254 nm combined with free chlorine the uv254 chlorine process was an attractive advanced oxidation process for removing mc lr zhang et al 2019 duan et al 2018 chlorine at 3 0 mg l 1 and a uv flux of 125 mj cm 2 removed 92 5 of mc lr much higher than the 20 3 removed by uv254 irradiation or the 65 1 removed by chlorination in the dark zhang et al 2019 the photolysis of chlorinated mc lr under uv irradiation at 254 nm wavelength has also been reported zhang et al 2016a these investigations suggested a clear synergistic effect between uv254 irradiation and chlorination however uv254 chlorine process requires the installation of uv lamps and consumes a lot of energy if sunlight could be used instead lamps could be omitted and power consumption would be reduced it has been reported solar chlorine process enhanced 24 structurally diverse pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps degradation compared to chlorination alone and solar irradiation alone hua et al 2019 it should be noted the efficiency of solar chlorine process would decrease quickly with increasing the optical path length nowell and hoignÃ© 1992a a shallow and open water reservoir was recommended for solar chlorine process jasper and sedlak 2013 therefore solar chlorine process provides an effective option for mc lr control especially for decentralized and point of use potable water treatment this study was designed to test whether or not that would be possible the photolysis of free chlorine hocl and ocl pka 7 5 were highly wavelength dependent solar wavelengths overlap with the absorption spectra of free chlorine in the range of 290 400 nm fig s7 solar driven photolysis of free chlorine generates hydroxyl radicals ho and reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl and cl2 and ground state atomic oxygen o 3p the latter of which was only generated under the irradiation wavelengths of 320 400 nm and further converted to ozone o3 through reacting with dissolved oxygen cooper et al 2007 o3 in particular is strong oxidant for pollutants removal it should be noted that uv254 chlorine process cannot produce o3 the primary reactive species generated from free chlorine photolysis is shown in reactions 1 6 buxton and subhani 1972 1 hocl ocl hv ho o cl Î» 400

determined a reaction rate constant between ho and mc lr of 1 1 1010m 1s 1 he et al 2014 rcs is known to contribute 21 3 of the mc lr removal at ph 7 0 in a uv chlorine system zhang et al 2019 rcs tend to attack the conjugated dienes in mc lr molecules reacting selectively with electron donors but which exact species chlorine radicals cl or chlorine dimer radical anions cl2 contributes most to mc lr removal is unknown furthermore solar photolysis of free chlorine yields o3 reactions 5 and 6 which is absent in uv chlorine processing o3 oxidizes mc lr quickly with a reaction rate constant of 4 1 105 m 1s 1 at ph 8 0 onstad et al 2007 oxidizing conjugated dienes and aromatic ring structures chang et al 2015 but o3 is also very reactive toward natural organic matter in water whether o3 generated from free chorine photolysis contributes significantly to mc lr degradation in natural waters remains unknown the objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of solar chlorine processing for mc lr degradation and detoxification the specific aims were 1 to identify the role of oxidative species in mc lr elimination and to clarify the mc lr degradation pathway involved 2 to investigate the kinetics of mc lr degradation in the solar chlorine process with different chlorine doses and at different ph alkalinity natural organic matter content and bromide content 3 to evaluate the potential for mc lr removal using natural sunlight and the dbps formed and 4 to assess the toxicity of the degradation byproducts 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals mc lr 95 was

trihalomethane thm haloacetic acid haa trichloronitromethane tcnm and haloacetonitrile han standards were purchased from sigma aldrich usa all of those chemicals were of reagent grade or higher and used without further purification 2 2 simulated solar and natural sunlight irradiation simulated solar irradiation was provided by a q sun xenon test chamber xe 1 solar simulator equipped with a daylight q optical filter 290 nm the total absolute irradiance spectrum of the solar simulator over the wavelength range 290 800 nm was measured using an ocean optics usb 4000 spectrometer and is shown in fig s7 the light intensity in the range of 290 400 nm which overlapped with the absorbance of hocl ocl was fixed at 35 5 w m 2 experiments were undertaken under headspace free conditions in 30 0 ml sealed quartz vials 5 cm in diameter and thermostated at 25 c in a circulating water bath fig s7b natural sunlight experiments were performed in may 2018 in guangzhou south china samples were irradiated by placing them on the roof of the laboratory building and the solutions were not temperature controlled 2 3 experimental procedures water samples 30 0 ml containing 1 0 Î¼m mc lr were buffered to ph 6 0 7 0 or 8 0 using 10 mm phosphate buffer or to ph 9 0 using 10 mm borate buffer in some experiments nitrobenzene or benzoic acid was added as a radical probe tert butyl alcohol t buoh or isopropanol ip was added as a radical quencher or hco3 nom or br were added to the mc lr solutions the experiments were initiated by adding free chlorine up to 42 0 Î¼m while exposing the vials to the simulated sunlight the samples were well stirred by a magnetic stirrer at pre determined time intervals 1 0 ml samples were collected any residual chlorine was quenched by adding 0 1 mg sodium sulfite and the levels of residual mc lr byproducts and toxicity were quantified for comparison experiments with solar irradiation alone and chlorination alone were also conducted following the same procedures the average dissolved oxygen concentration was measured to be 6 8 mg l 1 natural solar chlorine experiments were conducted using three natural samples designated as ym hs and xcq spiked with 1 0 Î¼m mc lr the samples were collected from three rivers in china s guangdong province and their properties are listed in table s1 the experiments under natural sunlight followed the same procedures as those under simulated sunlight except that the water samples were irradiated without ph adjustment dbp formation tests were performed using the ym sample after 5 min of treatment solar chlorination and the solar chlorine process samples were subjected to post chlorination by adding 10 mg l 1 of free chlorine and incubating for 72 h at 25 c all of the experiments were conducted in triplicate the relative standard deviation of the three replicates was less than 5 in all cases 2 4 rate constant determination the second order rate constants of cl and cl2 with mc lr were examined using a laser flash photolysis technique this technology has been used to measure rate constants for the reactions of cl and cl2 with mono and dichloramine li et al 2018 the experimental solution contained 10 mm na2s2o8 2 mm or 1 m nacl and 0 05 1 mm mc lr without ph adjustment ph 3 9 irradiated na2s2o8 solutions generate sulfate radicals so4 which react rapidly with cl and converted it to cl or cl2 with an equilibrium constant of 1 4 105 m 1 buxton et al 1998 cl2 exhibits strong absorption at 340 nm with a molar absorption coefficient of 8800 m 1 cm 1 alegre et al 2000 the rate constant of cl or cl2 s reaction with mc lr was estimated by monitoring absorbance at 340 nm as a surrogate for the decay rate of cl2 details are illustrated in the texts s1 and s2 in the si additionally bromine s reaction rate constant with mc lr was determined by a competition kinetics method employing phenol as the competitor the details are described in text s3 2 5 concentrations of reactive species the steady state concentrations of ho and cl were determined by employing nb and ba as probe compounds nowell and hoignÃ© 1992b more details are presented in text s4 in the si o3 concentrations were measured using cinnamic acid as the probe compound with details described in text s5 in the si forsyth et al 2013 additionally the concentrations of ho cl cl2 and clo were predicted using a kintecus model version 5 55 as illustrated in text s6 and table s2 such modelling has been used for predicting radical concentration in a few advanced oxidation processes parker et al 2016 2 6 analytical methods mc lr concentrations were measured with a u3000 high performance liquid chromatograph thermo scientific equipped with a 238 nm photodiode array detector using an agilent zorbax sb c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm 3 5 Î¼m particle size the mobile phase consisted of a acetonitrile and b 0 1 phosphoric acid in ultrapure water the method s detection limit for mc lr concentration was 0 05 Î¼m and the recovery was over 95 free chlorine was measured using the diethyl p phenylene diamine ferrous titration method apha 2005 doc concentrations were measured using a shimadzu toc vcph analyzer the analysis of chlorite chlorate nitrite nitrate and bromide was performed on a dionex ics 900 ion chromatograph equipped with an anionic column dionex ionpac as23 mc lr byproducts were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer equipped with a water acquity uplc beh c18 column 2 1 mm 100 mm 1 7 Î¼m particle size positive ion mode was applied and the mass spectrometry was at a source voltage of 2 3 kv a source temperature of 120 c a cone voltage of 40 v and a scan range of 50 1100 analysis of the mass spectra relied on masslynx 4 1 software the toxicity of the by products was evaluated using an elisa method qian et al 2015 a microcystin kit beacon analytical systems inc based on colorimetric protein phosphatase pp2a inhibition assay was used as illustrated in text s7 in the si the relative inhibition of pp2a was used to estimate detoxification it was computed using equation 7 7 inhibition l c l t l c 100 where l c and lt refer to the absorbances of a pp2a negative control and of samples containing mc lr after t minutes of treatment respectively thms haas and hans were analyzed using an agilent 7890a gas chromatograph equipped with an hp 5 fused silica capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm i d j w scientific according to usepa methods 551 1 and 552 3 the detection limits for thms haas and hans were all lower than 0 2 Î¼g l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 reaction rate constants of cl and cl2 with mc lr the rate constants for the reactions of cl and cl2 with mc lr were obtained using laser flash photolysis cl2 was generated via the reaction of sulfate radical with chloride as shown in text s1 the cl2 concentrations were determined based on absorption at 340 nm with an absorption coefficient of 8800 m 1 cm 1 the pseudo first order rate constant was calculated by monitoring the decay of transient absorbance at 340 nm alegre et al 2000 fig s1a illustrates the decay of cl2 absorption intensity and fig s1b shows the cl2 decay rate increased linearly with increasing initial mc lr concentration from 0 05 to 0 2 mm the second order rate constant between cl2 and mc lr was thus calculated to be 5 58 0 42 107 m 1s 1 the rate constant for the reaction of cl with mc lr was estimated to be 2 25 0 07 1010 m 1s 1 text s2 the reactivity of cl towards mc lr was three orders of magnitude higher than that of cl2 the rate constant of mc lr with cl was twice of that with ho 1 1 1010 m 1 s 1 again implying greater reactivity this is the first published report of these rate constants 3 2 kinetics of mc lr degradation in the solar chlorine process mc lr degradation rate in the solar chlorine process was faster than with solar irradiation or chlorination alone as shown in fig 1 mc lr degradation obeyed pseudo first order degradation kinetics in all three treatment processes fig s8 solar irradiation alone barely degraded mc lr less than 1 0 within 5 min which is consistent with previously published observations wÃ¶rmer et al 2010 with a 42 0 Î¼m dose of chlorine 3 0 mg l 1 cl2 at ph 7 0 chlorination degraded 61 4 of the mc lr in 5 min the solar chlorine treatment however demonstrated 94 6 degradation of mc lr in the same period the observed first order degradation rate k obs of mc lr was 1 1 10 2 s 1 in the solar chlorine process which was 2 8 fold higher than that in chlorination alone 2 6 10 3 s 1 solar chlorine treatment with a 21 0 Î¼m chlorine dose had a k obs for mc lr removal similar to that of chlorination with 42 0 Î¼m chlorine dose the solar chlorine process uses half as much chlorine for the same result by chlorination there is clearly synergy between the irradiation and free chlorine based on previous studies of mc lr degradation in chlorination zhang et al 2016b ho oxidation he et al 2015 and ozonation chang et al 2015 the susceptible reaction sites of mc lr in solar chlorine process were a relatively large amino acid moiety adda and methyl dehydroalanine mdha moiety on cyclic peptides fig s6 to identify the moieties primarily responsible for the observed mc lr degradation in the solar chlorine process the degradation kinetics of the two key functional groups in the mc lr molecule were examined as shown in fig 1 right sorbic acid mirrors the conjugated dienes of adda side chains 2 acetoamidoacrylic acid emulates the mdha groups onstad et al 2007 the degradation rate of sorbic acid k obs 1 2 10 1 s 1 in the solar chlorine process was about one order of magnitude higher than that of mc lr fig 1 it was found that higher concentrations of residual free chlorine existed in the sorbic acid solution than in the mc lr solution fig s9a the higher levels of free chlorine will result in higher yields of reactive species ho rcs and o3 during the solar driven photolysis as an example after solar chlorine treatment for 5 min at ph 7 0 the accumulative o3 concentration in the sorbic acid solution 6 1 10 8 m was 3 8 fold of that in the mc lr solution 1 6 10 8 m fig s9b meanwhile the rate constant of o3 toward sorbic acid 9 6 105 m 1s 1 was also higher than mc lr 4 1 105 m 1s 1 onstad et al 2007 similar to mc lr the degradation rates for sorbic acid in solar chlorine treatment were 1 6 to 2 0 fold faster than those in chlorination alone while solar irradiation alone had negligible removal a 42 0 Î¼m chlorine dose in the solar chlorine process degraded sorbic acid five times as fast 1 2 10 1 s 1 as 2 acetoamidoacrylic acid 2 4 10 2 s 1 these results suggest that the conjugated diene structure in the adda moieties is more reactive than the olefins in the mdha groups 3 3 relative roles of light free chlorine ho rcs and o3 equation 8 expresses mc lr degradation in the solar chlorine process as possibly attributed to direct solar photolysis as well as oxidation by chlorine ho rcs and o3 8 d m c l r d t k s o l a r k c h l o r i n e c h l o r i n e k h o h o k c l c l k c l 2 c l 2 k o 3 o 3 k o t h e r s m c l r where mc lr is the concentration of mc lr k solar is the pseudo first order rate constant of mc lr s degradation via solar photolysis k chlorine k ho k cl k cl2 and k o3 are the apparent second order rate constants between mc lr and free chlorine ho cl cl2 and o3 respectively table 1 the measured concentrations of reactive species are summarized in table 2 the ho concentrations were at level of 10 13 m which were 3 fold of cl level the o3 concentrations were above 10 8 m at ph ranged 7 0 to 9 0 and the highest o3 concentrations reached 2 8 10 8 m at ph 8 0 the predicted radicals concentrations showed good matches with the measured ones the predicted cl2 levels were used in equation 2 the individual contribution of each species to mc lr removal was calculated separately as illustrated in text s8 the ph dependent contribution by reactive species is shown in fig 2 the highest k obs was at ph 8 0 k obs 1 5 10 2 s 1 followed by ph 7 0 1 1 10 2 s 1 mc lr degradation was much slower at ph 6 0 7 6 10 3 s 1 and at ph 9 0 5 9 10 3 s 1 this observation is different from the results of uv chlorine treatment using 254 nm irradiation which showed decreasing mc lr degradation rates with increasing ph from 6 0 to 9 0 zhang et al 2019 this difference is attributable to the generation of o3 in the solar chlorine process whereas o3 was absent in the uv254 chlorine process at ph 8 0 free chlorine ho and rcs contributed to 5 6 7 8 and 5 2 of the mc lr degradation o3 contributed 76 1 at ph 6 0 by contrast the contributions were 35 0 from free chlorine 33 3 from ho 22 3 from rcs and only 7 3 from o3 previous study has demonstrated elevating ph enhanced free chlorine photolysis and this ph dependent is more significant at a longer wavelength yin et al 2018 therefore ph affects the levels of the reactive species and thus the degradation rate of mc lr free chlorine is the predominant agent in mc lr removal at ph 6 0 free chlorine exists as hocl and ocl pka 7 5 hocl reacts with mc lr 1 16 102 m 1s 1 more quickly than ocl 6 78 m 1s 1 acero et al 2005 additionally increasing ph accelerates the photodecay rate of free chlorine the sunlight induced decay rate of free chlorine is 1 0 h 1 at ph 6 0 which increases to 6 3 h 1 at ph 9 0 cooper et al 2007 as a result the contribution of free chlorine reduces significantly from 35 0 at ph 6 0 to 1 9 at ph 9 0 o3 contributed 52 7 of the mc lr degradation at ph 7 0 in the solar chlorine process the rate constant of o3 with mc lr has been reported to be 4 1 105 m 1s 1 onstad et al 2007 the quantum yield of o 3p from free chlorine photolysis was 0 07 0 08 and 0 28 at 254 313 and 365 nm respectively and o 3p can quickly react with o2 to generate o3 buxton and subhani 1972 the presence of o3 about 10 8 m clearly enhanced mc lr degradation o3 s contribution was greater at ph 7 0 9 0 than at ph 6 0 elevating ph from 6 0 to 8 0 resulted in a larger the proportion of ocl enhancing o3 generation the highest o3 concentration was observed at ph 8 0 around 2 8 10 8 m contributing greatly to mc lr degradation whereas mc lr degradation rate at ph 9 5 9 10 3 s 1 was 40 of that at ph 8 1 5 10 2 s 1 the lower k obs for mc lr degradation at ph 9 compared to ph 8 was attributed to the lower ozone level fig s5 indicates o3 concentration at ph 9 0 1 1 10 8 m was also 40 of that at ph 8 0 2 8 10 8 m after 5 min of solar chlorine process it can be inferred that increasing ph from 8 0 to 9 0 increased the proportion of ocl from 65 to 97 which enhanced o 3p scavenging and thus reduced o3 generation reaction 9 zhou et al 2014 9 o p 3 o c l clo 2 k 9 9 4 10 9 m 1 s 1 ho contributed 14 3 of the mc lr removal at ph 7 0 the photolysis of free chlorine generated ho through reactions 1 and 2 and it has been reported that mc lr is oxidized by ho with the rate constant of 1 1 1010 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 antoniou et al 2008 as is shown in table 2 the steady state concentrations of ho ranged around the level of 10 13 m the contribution of ho was reduced by 17 2 at phs from 6 0 to 9 0 ho is scavenged by ocl 8 8 109 m 1s 1 17 6 times faster than by hocl 5 0 108 m 1s 1 chuang et al 2017 therefore a higher ph resulted in a lower contribution from ho rcs can also contribute to mc lr degradation in the solar chlorine process as discussed at section 3 1 the second order rate constants of mc lr with cl and cl2 were estimated to be 2 3 1010 and 5 58 107 m 1s 1 respectively the measured cl concentration 10 14 m and the predicted cl2 level 10 13 m thus suggest that the contributions of cl and cl2 to mc lr degradation were 9 6 and 0 1 respectively as with ho phs from 6 0 to 9 0 reduced the contribution of cl by 11 6 additionally other unidentified reactive species also contributed up to 4 9 of the observed mc lr elimination clo about 10 10 m is reported to react with methoxybenzene and phenolic compounds at around 108 m 1s 1 and may also contribute to mc lr removal guo et al 2017 to further confirm the roles of reactive species quenching experiments were conducted in which 50 mm tert butanol t buoh or 250 mm isopropanol was added to the solutions the levels of radicals in the presence of scavengers are listed in table 2 ho and cl and o 3p can be quenched effectively by t buoh at 6 0 108 3 0 108 and 3 8 107 m 1 s 1 respectively wu et al 2017 zhou et al 2014 accordingly adding 50 mm t buoh scavenged 99 2 of ho 96 3 of cl and 62 6 of o 3p table s4 patton et al 2017 the drop of o 3p resulted in an equivalent decrease in o3 production this incomplete scavenging of reactive species could account for the 56 3 inhibition of mc lr degradation k obs 4 8 10 3 s 1 as shown in fig s9 250 mm ip reduced the mc lr degradation rate by 89 4 to 1 4 10 3s 1 primarily due to the entirely scavenging of reactive species except for free chlorine a similar effect of the two quenchers on modelling adda moiety was also observed fig s9 3 4 products the mc lr degradation products from the solar chlorine process were identified by liquid chromatography coupled with a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer operating in positive mode mc lr degradation products were detected primarily at p795 p835 p1011 p1029 p1047 and their isomers table s5 the detailed ms ms spectra and chromatograms are provided in figs s12 s18 hydroxyl mc lr is mainly generated from ho and o3 attacks on the double bond of mc lr diol mc lrs were the predominant products designated as p1029a b c d 995 5 34 1029 5 corresponding to the chemical formula c49h76n10o14 four distinct peaks were observed at m z 1029 5612 to 1029 5640 suggesting at least 4 different pathways for p1029 formation then dehydration at two adjacent hydroxyl groups of diol mc lr p1029 produced p1011 1029 5 18 1011 5 p1011 m z 1011 5521 can also be generated via ho and o3 attack on aromatic rings 995 5 16 1011 5 chloro mc lr products were also observed p1047 m z 1047 5206 may form through chlorination or the addition of rcs to the double bonds of mc lr 995 5 35 17 1047 5 alternatively diol mc lr enhances the electron density of mc lr and promote chlorine adduction and dehydration to generate p1047 1029 5 35 17 1047 5 meanwhile the addition of rcs to aromatic rings forms monochloro mc lr p1029 e 995 5 35 1 1029 5 corresponding to m z 1029 5216 with a formula of c49h73n10o12cl zhang et al 2016a chloro mc lr p1047 and p1029e can be degraded to p1011 via photo induced dechlorination and further hydroxylation li and blatchley iii 2009 finally aldehyde mc lr p795 m z 795 3923 and ketone mc lr p835 m z 835 4315 were generated through the cleavage of the c4 c5 or c6 c7 bonds of adda moiety several products such as p570 p331 p242 formed eventually via hydrolysis and peptide bond breaking fig 3 proposes a scheme for mc lr degradation in the solar chlorine process beyond non radical chlorination rcs may promote chloro mc lr formation via both electrophilic attack on unsaturated bonds and hydrogen abstraction reactions chloro mc lr can then be transformed into hydroxyl mc lr through the cleavage of c cl or n cl bonds by photochemical dechlorination and hydroxylation li and blatchley iii 2009 based on the intermediates identified adda and mdha moieties were the major reactive sites which is consistent with kinetics described in section 3 2 those two moieties contain unsaturated bonds which tend to be attacked by both reactive radicals and o3 onstad et al 2007 the cleavage of hydroxylated mc lr then results in the formation of aldehyde mc lr and carboxyl mc lr further mc lr molecule destruction occurs through the cleavage of peptide bonds fig 4 a illustrates the evolution of mc lr intermediates in the solar chlorine process using relative peak intensities diol mc lr products dominate the highest intensity of p1029b was obtained at 6 min followed by a gradual decrease with time p835 clearly increased within 4 min followed by a quick decrease p795 was generated gradually at 2 min notably p835 and p795 was not observed in uv254 chlorine process zhang et al 2019 less peak abundance of chloro mc lr p1029e and p1047 was observed than of hydroxyl mc lr probably due to photolytic dechlorination the evolution of mc lr degradation products under irradiation and in the dark were distinctly different as fig s10 shown p1029b reached a maximum within 2 min in dark chlorination and the remained stable and the intensity of p1029b was about 30 fold higher than under irradiation but little p835 was formed in the dark these results suggest that more degradation pathways were available in the solar chlorine process than in chlorination alone confirming the important roles of ho rcs and o3 in mc lr removal 3 5 toxicity detoxification was evaluated based on the inhibition of pp2a activity fig 4b indicates that the solar chlorine process can detoxify mc lr substantially better than chlorination or solar irradiation alone after 10 min the relative inhibition of pp2p activity reduced by 77 0 in solar chlorine treatment which was much larger than the sum of chlorination alone reduced by 46 7 and sunlight irradiation alone increased by 11 1 the relative toxicity by the solar chlorine treatment dropped from 67 8 after 1 min to 23 3 after 5 min although solar chlorine process enhanced the detoxification of mc lr some mc lr transformation products are still toxic the toxicity caused by treated mc lr solution could result from chlorinated or hydroxyl mclr by products zong et al 2013 since adda groups are responsible for mc lr s toxicity he et al 2016 the destruction of adda moieties was presumably involved the degradation products suggest that hydroxylation of diene structures on adda moieties occurred with the participation of reactive radicals within the first 5 min of solar chlorine treatment that process contributed to mc lr detoxification effectively then with longer treatment parent mc lr was further destroyed to limit the production of toxic products such as aldehyde mc lr and ketone mc lr so the solar chlorine process exhibited synergistic detoxification as well as degradation 3 6 mc lr elimination and dbp formation in natural waters experiments were also conducted using surface water samples spiked with 1 0 Î¼m mc lr under natural sunlight solar chlorine treatment again exhibited better mc lr degradation than with either natural sunlight or chlorination alone fig 5 a taking ym water as an example the k obs was 6 5 10 3 s 1 in the solar chlorine process much higher than the 1 5 10 5 s 1 with solar irradiation alone and the 1 3 10 3 s 1 observed with chlorination but compared to ultrapure water mc lr degradation was reduced by 26 1 52 5 in the three natural waters tested the xcq sample had a higher ph at 7 6 than the other two water samples ph both about 7 2 which is beneficial for mc lr degradation higher mc lr degradation rate was observed in natural solar chlorine process compared to the simulated solar chlorine treatment due to the uv fluence at 290 400 nm of the natural solar light 41 8 w m 2 was higher than that of the simulated solar light 35 5 w m 2 see fig s7 hco3 nom and br can all affect mc lr removal efficiency the three natural water samples contained 4 2 15 0 mg l 1 of hco3 2 4 5 0 mg c l 1 of nom and 30 Î¼g l 1 of br all of which might be expected to influence mc lr degradation in the solar chlorine process therefore separate experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of these three compounds on mc lr degradation fig s11 shows the k obs decreased by 27 3 in the presence of 50 mg l 1 hco3 mainly because of the scavenging of ho and cl by hco3 wu et al 2017 meanwhile 5 mg c l 1 of srnom reduced the mc lr degradation rate by 41 4 due to competition between the nom and mc lr for free chlorine o3 and ho table s3 bromide on the other hand greatly enhanced mc lr degradation the k obs increased to 2 1 10 2 s 1 in the presence of 2 5 Î¼m bromide and to 2 7 10 2 s 1 with 5 0 Î¼m bromide this enhancement could be ascribed to the formation of free bromine hobr obr via bromide reacting with free chlorine bousher et al 1986 the apparent second order rate constant between hobr obr and mc lr was determined to be 1 3 104 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 which is two orders of magnitude greater than the hocl ocl rate constant table 1 hobr photolysis yields reactive bromine species such as br bro and br2 clbr radicals can also be formed from bromide s reacting with rcs cheng et al 2018 but the bromide ion in the three natural waters tested was less than 0 4 Î¼m so overall the observed mc lr degradation in real waters was reduced in comparison with ultrapure water but still more than 85 8 mc lr degradation was achieved during the first 5 min of irradiation disinfection by products dbps form when chlorine is used the dbps formation were estimated using ym water spiked with 1 0 Î¼m mc lr for 5 min of treatment solar chlorination and solar chlorine process after 5 min of solar chlorine treatment mc lr concentration reduced from 1 0 to 0 1 Î¼m and free chlorine concentration was less than 0 3 mg l 1 the treated samples were then dosed with 10 mg l 1 free chlorine for post chlorination and incubated for 72 h fig 5b shows that the solar chlorine process generated 30 9 less thms 24 9 less haas and 44 4 less tcnm than dark chlorination the ho cl and o3 generated through chlorine photolysis may alter nom s properties reducing dbps formation previous research suggested solar chlorine treatment led to higher dbps yields compared to chlorination alone young et al 2018 the different results may attribute to the different water source and treatment procedure the solar chlorine treatment followed by post chlorination generated 0 8 Î¼g l 1 of hans whereas 0 4 Î¼g l 1 of hans generated in chlorination scheme the enhanced hans formation may have been due to reaction of amino groups in the mc lr with rcs zhang et al 2015 overall the solar chlorine process produced dbp levels meeting chinese drinking water standards in terms of both thms and haas concentrations less than 70 Î¼g l 1 the formation of chlorite clo2 chlorate clo3 and bromate bro3 was also assessed after 5 min of reaction chlorite and bromate formation was below the detection limit 0 02 mg l 1 in the three processes the formation of chlorate was observed in chlorination 0 04 mg l 1 and in the solar chlorine process 0 11 mg l 1 in the solar chlorine process o 3p reacted with ocl to form chlorite 9 4 109 m 1s 1 which was further oxidized to chlorate 1 59 1010 m 1s 1 buxton and subhani 1972 overall these chlorate values were below the guidelines of drinking water in china 0 70 mg l 1 for chlorite and for chlorate 4 conclusions the solar chlorine process effectively degrades mc lr a 42 Î¼m chlorine dose and 5 min of solar irradiation can degrade 94 6 of the mc lr in ultrapure water and over 85 8 in natural waters the mc lr degradation rate in the solar chlorine process is 2 8 fold faster than in chlorination alone with a 42 Î¼m chlorine dose in ultrapure water besides free chlorine ho cl and o3 also contribute to mc lr degradation in the combined process the second order rate constants for cl and cl2 reacting with mc lr are 2 25 0 07 1010 and 5 58 0 42 107 m 1s 1 respectively the best mc lr removal is observed at ph 8 0 and o3 was the predominant oxidizing component at that ph the double bonds on adda side chain and mdha moieties are the main attack sites on mc lr molecule additionally the cleavage of adda moieties contributes to the detoxification of mc lr overall solar chlorine purification is a good alternative to uv254 based advanced oxidation processes it effectively removes mc lr saves chlorine and forms fewer dbps solar chlorine is cheap and simple technology suitable for practical drinking water treatment especially for rural areas where algal blooming is feared the solar chlorine reactor design requires careful attention to potential impacts of optical path length of solar irradiation on mc lr degradation

18787,this work evaluated the removal of a mixture of eight antibiotics i e ampicillin amp azithromycin azm erythromycin ery clarithromycin cla ofloxacin ofl sulfamethoxazole smx trimethoprim tmp and tetracycline tc from urban wastewater by ozonation operated in continuous mode at different hydraulic retention times hrts i e 10 20 40 and 60 min and specific ozone doses i e 0 125 0 25 0 50 and 0 75

limits was achieved with hrt of 40 min and specific ozone dose of 0 125 go3 gdoc 1 the effect of ozonation was also investigated at a microbiological and genomic level by studying the efficiency of the process with respect to the inactivation of escherichia coli and antibiotic resistant e coli as well as to the reduction of the abundance of selected antibiotic resistance genes args the inactivation of total cultivable e coli was achieved under the experimental conditions of hrt 40 min and 0 25 go3 gdoc 1 at which all antibiotic compounds were already degraded the regrowth examinations revealed that higher ozone concentrations were required for the permanent inactivation of e coli below the limit of quantification loq 0 01 cfu ml 1 also the abundance of the examined args intl1 aada1 dfra1 qaceÎ´1 and sul1 was found to decrease with increasing hrt and ozone dose despite the fact that the mildest operating parameters were able to eliminate the parent compounds of the tested antibiotics in wastewater effluents it was clearly demonstrated in this study that higher ozone doses were required in order to confer permanent damage and or death and prevent potential post treatment re growth of both total bacteria and arb and to reduce the abundance of args below the loq interestingly the mineralization of wastewater in terms of dissolved organic carbon doc removal was found to be significantly low even when the higher ozone doses were applied leading to an increased phytotoxicity towards various plant species the findings of this study clearly underline the importance of properly optimising the ozonation process e g specific ozone dose and contact time taking into consideration both the bacterial species and associated args as well as the wastewater physicochemical properties e g doc in order to mitigate the spread of arb args as well as to reduce the potential phytotoxicity graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotics antibiotic resistance phytotoxicity ozonation continuous mode 1 introduction nowadays the ecosystems and the human health are threatened by the environmental occurrence of both chemical and biological contaminants of emerging concern cecs such as antibiotics and acquired antibiotic resistance genes args mobilized by antibiotic resistant bacteria arb arb args are considered as a serious public health problem by various international organizations and the european union eu because of their widespread in the environment food chain and even drinking water among others rizzo et al 2013 berendonk et al 2015 recently the environmental dimension of antimicrobial resistance has been identified as one of the six emerging issues of environmental concern according to the united nations environment unep 2017 apha 2005 in fact arb can often do work synergistically by interacting with each other in a variety of mechanisms that enhance remarkably their collective capability to transfer args leading to antibiotic resistance described two decades ago by salyers and amabile cuevas 1997 as an easy to get hard to lose phenomenon in the face of regional and global antibiotic resistance challenges the european commission stands at the forefront for intensifying its efforts to shape a relevant legislative instrument with regard to the minimum quality criteria for the assessment of reclaimed wastewater intended for agricultural irrigation and aquifer recharge including antibiotic resistance and related risks eu 2017a in the last decade urban wastewater treatment plants uwtps have been considered as critical hotspots for the propagation of antibiotic resistance in the environment with the consequences being potentially compounded by the reuse of treated wastewater the fact that uwtps are not specifically designed for the elimination of antibiotic compounds michael et al 2013 accompanied by an increase in the prevalence of arb and their associated args has triggered an imperative need to improve the efficiency of the existing treatment processes pruden 2013 karkman et al 2017 michael kordatou et al 2018 manaia et al 2018 in this sense various advanced chemical oxidation processes aops have been extensively investigated to efficiently remove antibiotic residues michael et al 2013 inactivate arb and remove args from wastewater effluents at bench pilot and full scale applications zhuang et al 2015 alexander et al 2016 czekalski et al 2016 ferro et al 2016 lee and von gunten 2016 sousa et al 2017 karaolia et al 2018 in a recent review michael kordatou et al 2018 investigated the fate of arb args during aops the key operating conditions affecting their efficiency to inactivate arb and remove args and the main oxidative damage pathways involved in these processes indicating that besides the operating conditions the variable behavior observed by the various examined genetic constituents of the microbial community may be directed by the process distinct oxidative damage mechanisms in place during the application of each treatment technology a great deal of interest has been focused on the application of ozone based systems which have been demonstrated to be effective in achieving significant abatement of various microcontaminants while also providing sufficient disinfection of wastewater at different ozone doses and contact times von gunten 2003 2018 ikehata et al 2006 in fact the knowledge on the efficiency of ozonation to eliminate arb args is limited since most studies performed so far only focused on the effect of ozone on cultivable bacterial populations with the effect of the process on arb or args being still unclear michael kordatou et al 2018 ozone is a powerful oxidant and has been widely used during the last years for the treatment of wastewater it reacts selectively with organic compounds via a direct reaction with ozone molecules or through an indirect pathway with hydroxyl radicals ho under alkaline ph conditions which result from ozone decay in water and wastewater ozonation has been shown to have a high potential for the oxidation of a variety of pharmaceutical compounds including antibiotics and the inactivation of total pathogenic bacteria in drinking water and wastewater antoniou et al 2013 von gunten 2018 the few studies published so far suggest that ozonation is effective to inactivate arb and remove args and also to eliminate the potential bacterial regrowth under proper optimized conditions specific ozone dose and exposure time michael kordatou et al 2018 however further studies are necessary to fill in the gaps of knowledge in relation to the effectiveness of ozonation to the inactivation of arb and the reduction of the abundance of args within this context the aim of the present work was to investigate and optimize the efficiency of ozonation operated in continuous mode for the abatement of a diverse array of antibiotic related chemical and microbiological microcontaminants from secondary treated wastewater effluents the objectives of this study were to assess i the removal of a mixture of eight antibiotics belonging to different classes and exhibiting different physicochemical properties being the macrolides included in the eu watch list of substances for union wide monitoring eu 2017b eu 2018 namely azithromycin azm erythromycin ery clarithromycin cla as well as ampicillin amp ofloxacin ofl sulfamethoxazole smx trimethoprim tmp and tetracycline tc ii the inactivation of wastewater autochthonous total and antibiotic resistant escherichia coli and to further evaluate their regrowth potential after treatment iii the reduction of the abundance of selected genes originally present in wastewater specifically the bacterial biomarker 16s rrna the class 1 integron integrase inti1 and args i e qacÎ´e1 sul1 aada1 and dfra1 iv the extent of mineralization of the treated wastewater and v the evolution of phytotoxicity against selected plant species according to the authors knowledge this work is among the first studies revealing comprehensive data regarding the oxidation of a mixture of antibiotics rather than one compound at environmentally low concentrations rather than high concentrations during the application of ozonation in continuous mode rather in batch mode simulating thus a more realistic scenario from the uwtp full scale perspective combined with the assessment of the process in removing arb args rather than evaluating only the disinfection efficiency in relation to the inactivation of various bacterial groups and phytotoxicity the results obtained by existing studies performed on the ozonation of wastewater table s1 may be sometimes contradictory while in many cases the lack and or heterogeneity of the scientific data e g different target microcontaminants different experimental configurations etc as well as the different methodological approaches applied in the various studies make difficult the accurate evaluation of the efficiency of the ozonation the innovation of this study lies in the fact that it evaluates the efficiency of ozonation operated in continuous mode in relation to the simultaneous removal of both chemical i e antibiotics and biological i e arb args microcontaminants as well as phytotoxicity which is another important parameter when wastewater reuse in crop irrigation is considered also this is one of the very first attempts made to investigate if the variable region of class1 integrons might undergo excision after exposure to ozone herein indicated by a

procedure ozonation experiments were performed in a continuous mode through a flow through reactor where untreated wastewater effluents were pumped on a continuous basis and treated samples were exiting continuously a cylindrical borosilicate bubble column reactor fig 1 a 3 0 cm internal diameter i d 70 cm height useful volume of approximately 310 ml packed with ca 400 glass rings was used in order to promote the contact between the gas phase and wastewater increasing the mass transfer of ozone the use of borosilicate in the reactor column ensured that no adsorption desorption of the examined compounds on the reactor walls occurred this material has been widely used in ozonation reactors mecha et al 2017 orhon et al 2017 rozas et al 2017 also the borosilicate bubble column provides the possibility of visual contact in the reactor to avoid any malfunctions during the performance of the experiments regardless of the type of experiment performed the reactor was always filled with ultrapure water and the experiments commenced t 0 0 min when the wastewater to be treated was pumped into the reactor through the peristaltic pump fig 1b being diluted until achieving steady state conditions preliminary experiments through conductivity measurements with a tracer solution of nacl concentration of 2 000 mg l 1 were performed to determine the time required to achieve the steady state for each hrt fig s1 for the examined hrts i e 10 20 40 and 60 min the inlet liquid flow rate varied between 40 and 6 ml min 1 according to fig 1 the wastewater effluents were continuously entering the reactor by the bottom of the column fig 1c and leaving it from its top fig 1d the efficiency of the process was estimated after achieving the steady state for each selected hrt a bmt 802x ozone generator fig 1e was used to produce ozone from pure oxygen the desired ozone concentration was produced through the adjustment of the o2 gas flow rate which varied from 20 to 160 ml min 1 adjusted by a mass flow controller fig 1f and the electric intensity of the ozone generator the ozone concentration was normalised to the doc values of each sample at each treatment time

ozone escaping the reactor in the gas phase was carefully removed by gas washing bottles filled with a ki solution fig 1g two sets of experiments were performed using 1 wastewater effluents as collected and 2 wastewater effluents spiked with the mixture of the selected antibiotics moreover experiments with the addition of h2o2 at different concentrations i e 0 0 04 0 08 and 0 12 mm were also performed the selected concentrations were based on previous studies valero et al 2015 in an attempt to optimize the concentration of h2o2 able to enhance the degradation efficiency of pollutants by catalytic decomposition of o3 generating ho avoiding the use of an excessive amount which could favour the reaction with ho to form a weaker hydroperoxyl radical ho2 ribeiro et al 2019 prior to chromatographic analysis the obtained samples were transferred immediately to glass vials with a stoichiometric excess of catalase solution in order to remove any residual oxidants all samples were subsequently filtered through 1 2 Î¼m glass fiber filters 47 mm gf c whatman maidstone united kingdom the non spiked wastewater samples were pre concentrated by solid phase extraction spe using oasis

and manaia 2010 michael et al 2012 the chromogenic agar of tryptone bile x glucuronide t bx sigma aldrich steinhein germany was used for the detection and enumeration of escherichia coli for the enumeration of arb the medium was spiked with tmp or smx at concentrations of 16 or 516 mg l 1 respectively these concentrations were chosen based on the minimum inhibitory concentration mic of each of the examined antibiotics as determined in the clinical and laboratory standards institute clsi wayne 2007 serial dilutions of each sample were prepared in a saline solution nacl 0 85 and filtered through mixed cellulose ester membranes 0 22 Î¼m pore size millipore which were placed onto the culture medium and incubated for 24 h at 44 1 c for e coli bacteria counts expressed as colony forming units per ml cfu ml were enumerated on the respective culture media with the limit of quantification loq of e coli being equal to 1 cfu 100 ml 1 since 100 ml was the maximum volume filtered the prevalence of antibiotic resistant e coli was assumed as the ratio of cfu ml 1 observed on the medium containing the antibiotic and that cfu ml 1 on the medium without antibiotic as described elsewhere novo and manaia 2010 karaolia et al 2017 additionally the regrowth potential of the examined bacterial groups was investigated in ozonated samples in which the examined bacterial groups were at levels below loq regrowth was examined after 24 48 or 72 h of storage in the dark at both 24 1 c and 44 1 c this investigation took place in order to examine whether the reduction of the examined bacterial groups denoted their permanent inactivation or if it was a transient effect of injury and temporary inactivation with regrowth after some time for repair reactivation the examination of the ozonation regrowth capacity aimed at giving insights on the potential bacterial regrowth after treatment in order to have an indication of what could happen in terms of faecal contamination if the treated wastewater was discharged in a natural receiving environment or stored to be used for reuse purposes 2 6 quantification of selected args total genomic dna was used to monitor selected genes and args in the treated samples obtained from different experimental runs performed at different operating conditions the genes examined to this study were the four args of aada1 dfra1 qaceÎ´1 and sul1 the class 1 integron integrase inti1 and the housekeeping gene of 16s rrna the reasons of selecting these genes args are provided in section 3 3 three sets of experimental conditions were selected to assess the effect of the experimental parameters i e hrt and specific ozone dose on the reduction of the abundance of the selected genes i 0 25 g o3 gdoc 1 and hrt of 10 min which can be considered as a realistic scenario in a full scale uwtp with many studies in the literature reporting these conditions ii 0 75 go3 gdoc 1 and hrt of 40 min which were the optimum conditions determined in this study for the degradation of the target antibiotics and the bacterial inactivation and iii 0 25 go3 gdoc 1 and hrt of 40 min in order to examine the influence of lower ozone dose along with higher contact time the total genomic dna extraction was performed using the powerwater dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc following filtration of the samples volume 900 1000 ml through polycarbonate filter membranes 45 mm diameter 0 22 Î¼m pore size millipore dna quantification was assessed using a qubit 3 0 fluorometer thermofisher scientific quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr stepone tm real time pcr system lifetechnologies carlsbad ca usa using sybr green chemistry was employed to measure the abundance per ml of sample of aada1 dfra1 qaceÎ´1 and sul1 inti1 and 16s rrna calibration curves based on adequate ten fold dilution series of the standards for the respective gene were run along with the test samples primers information and qpcr conditions are listed in table 2 2 7 phytotoxicity assays the phytotoxicity assessment of samples collected before and after the ozonation treatment at the same experimental conditions mentioned in section 2 6 was carried out in triplicate using the phytotestkit microbiotest microbiotests inc the selection of this phytotoxicity assay among various toxicity tests aimed at providing evidence on the suitability of the ozonation process as a tertiary treatment for wastewater effluents intended for reuse in agricultural irrigation the following plants were used in this assay due to their rapid germination and growth of roots and shoots and their sensitivity to low concentrations of phytotoxic substances monocotyl sorgho sorghum saccharatum dicotyl garden cress lepidium sativum and dicotyl mustard sinapis alba a control test was performed using tap water the data interpretation is extensively described elsewhere michael et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of antibiotics the efficiency of the ozonation process operated in continuous mode in degrading the target antibiotics was assessed under various hrts i e 10 20 40 and 60 min and specific ozone concentrations i e 0 125 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 go3 gdoc 1 these conditions i e hrts and ozone doses were selected based on the findings of previous studies dealing with the application of ozonation for the removal of various organic microcontaminants reungoat et al 2012 prieto rodrÃ­guez et al 2013 margot et al 2013 marce et al 2016 sousa et al 2017 and taking into account the full scale applicability of the process in relation to the operating cost the latter was taken into consideration by applying the lowest ozone dose able to effectively eliminate the examined compounds under continuous mode operation the results revealed that the spiked antibiotics in mixture were efficiently degraded 99 by ozonation applying both hrts of 40 and 60 min at all examined ozone concentrations figs s2c and d for the lower hrts of 10 min and 20 min with an ozone dose of 0 125 go3 gdoc 1 figs s2a and b only smx ofl and tc were degraded rapidly below the lod while amp azm cla ery and tmp were degraded up to 84 73 98 70 and 96 respectively when gradually increasing the ozone dose the elimination of the parent compounds of all antibiotics was shown to slightly increase for both hrts of 10 and 20 min 10 min this behaviour was expected even at low ozone doses since this oxidant is able to either selectively attack double bonds and molecules containing electron rich moieties present in the different classes of the examined antibiotic compounds e g macrolides sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones or develop a radical oxidation pathway due to its self decomposition at the natural ph of the wastewater ph 7 3 7 8 considering that the experiments were conducted at the inherent ph of the wastewater effluents it can be assumed that the elimination of the parent compounds was predominantly driven by ho rather than the direct reaction with molecular o3 michael kordatou et al 2017 the results presented herein are consistent with those reported in other relevant scientific studies using different reactor configurations and applying different ozone concentrations reungoat et al 2012 lee et al 2013 margot et al 2013 prieto rodrÃ­guez et al 2013 for instance lee et al 2013 reported a degradation higher than 90 for tmp and smx in secondary treated effluents treated by a bench scale semi continuous ozonation another similar bench scale study using ozonation at semi operation mode demonstrated that the elimination of the parent compounds of sulfonamide and macrolide antibiotics spiked in ultrapure water and in pharmaceutical wastewater effluents was achieved in less than 20 min lin et al 2009 in a pilot scale ozonation study 0 32 1 23 go3 gdoc 1 hrts up to 20 min margot et al 2013 reported the removal of 40 microcontaminants including azm cla tmp and smx over 80 from secondary treated wastewater effluents a removal of 90 of microcontaminants including cla ery ofl smx and tmp from secondary treated effluents was reported after a treatment time of 20 min using pilot scale ozonation operating in a semi continuous mode 0 19 go3 gdoc 1 prieto rodrÃ­guez et al 2013 similar results were reported by reungoat et al 2010 in a study dealing with full scale ozonation 5 mgo3 l 1 and hrt 15 min of secondary treated wastewater among the 25 selected microcontaminants quantified in the samples 9 showed a reduction of more than 90 including ery tmp and smx and 13 others were reduced by more than 70 overall the degradation of the parent compounds of the antibiotics was improved with increasing the hrt and ozone dose as expected according to the aforementioned results obtained from the spiked experiments the hrt of 40 min could be considered as optimum since it allowed to achieve a rapid and complete elimination of the parent compounds of all the examined antibiotics at Î¼g l 1 level even when using the lowest applied ozone dose of 0 125 go3 gdoc 1 fig s2 however considering that the application of ozonation at a full scale uwtp for 40 min is not cost effective and that no significant differences were found between the different applied ozone concentrations for the hrts of 10 and 20 min a new set of experiments was carried out to determine the optimum experimental conditions with respect to the antibiotics degradation at the lowest hrts of 10 and 20 min by examining the contribution of the addition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to the overall process efficiency the degradation of the target antibiotics was investigated by comparing single ozonation absence of h2o2 and ozonation assisted by the addition of h2o2 at different concentrations i e 0 04 0 08 and 0 12 mm which were selected according to the findings reported in previous studies cho and yoon 2006 lanao et al 2008 valero et al 2015 the addition of h2o2 to the ozonation process leads to the so called peroxone process o3 h2o2 which is expected to promote higher removals of organic compounds than single ozonation due to the enhanced ozone decay and production rate of ho von gunten 2003 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 fig 2 shows the effect of the addition of h2o2 on the degradation of each antibiotic by ozonation for the hrt of 10 min as a function of the applied ozone concentration it can be observed in fig 2b d that the increase of the oxidant concentration had a marginal influence on the degradation of the examined antibiotics the results obtained in this study revealed that the removal of the antibiotics which were not completely degraded by single ozonation amp azm and ery was similar with that observed when applying the o3 h2o2 process for all the tested concentrations of h2o2 amp azm and ery were not completely removed after 10 min of treatment under all the tested ozone doses and h2o2 concentrations and their removal percentages by single o3 and combined o3 h2o2 treatments was differed only by 2 3 this may be caused by the rapid consumption of ozone by dissolved effluent organic matter defom when using low specific ozone doses go3 gdoc 1 0 5 this reaction outcompetes the relatively slow reaction of ozone with h2o2 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 lee et al 2014 miklos et al 2018 similarly acero and von gunten 2001 also reported the effect of the wastewater qualitative parameters on the efficiency of ozonation and o3 h2o2 several studies have reported similar findings indicating that the enrichment of the ozonation reaction with h2o2 slightly affected the degradation of microcontaminants for instance lee et al 2013 reported negligible variations when adding h2o2 in wastewater the h2o2 o3 molar ratio and ozone doses ranged between 0 5 1 0 and 0 25 1 5 go3 gdoc 1 respectively when using a lab scale ozone reactor operating in batch mode to examine the degradation of 16 microcontaminants including tmp and smx in secondary treated effluents similar results were obtained in the study of lee et al 2014 who reported that the removal of the tested microcontaminants during o3 h2o2 process increased only slightly 10 by the addition of h2o2 molar ratio h2o2 o3 0 0 25 and 0 5 in a pilot scale ozonation 0 64 1 08 go3 gdoc 1 hrts 12 23 min addition of h2o2 up to 2 5 mg l 1 kovalova et al 2013 reported a negligible improvement of 10 for microcontaminants elimination by o3 h2o2 in comparison to single ozonation therefore these results showed that the addition of h2o2 which would increase the operating cost of the process did not enhance remarkably the degradation of the examined compounds however it is important to mention that in the experiments performed with non spiked wastewater effluents inherent antibiotics concentrations even the mildest experimental conditions tested with single ozonation hrt of 10 min and 0 125 go3 gdoc 1 were found to be able to provide a removal of the examined microcontaminants table 1 to concentrations below their limit of detection in order to investigate whether the mildest ozonation conditions were adequate towards the inactivation of arb and removal of args a new series of optimization experiments was performed with varying ozone doses and hrts as discussed in the following sections 3 2 inactivation of total and antibiotic resistant cultivable escherichia coli the ozonation process operated in continuous mode was investigated with regard to its efficiency to inactivate the total and antibiotic resistant cultivable e coli the selection of e coli was based on its role as indicator of microbiological contamination e coli and faecal coliforms in general are used worldwide as indicators of faecal contamination in particular to assess the microbiological water wastewater quality and are included in the wastewater legislation for reuse purposes apha 2005 iso9308 1 2000 e coli are excreted in faeces and consequently they reach uwtps where they can survive and thrive throughout the cas treatment forster et al 2002 wellington et al 2013 karaolia et al 2017 therefore the ubiquity of these bacteria in human impacted environments together with their persistence in the environment as well as genome plasticity make them important tracers to assess the antibiotic resistance status of environmental samples additionally in previous studies including both gram negative and gram positive faecal indicator bacteria e coli and enterococcus spp respectively noteworthy differences were not observed regarding their inactivation comparing both groups enterococcus spp has usually lower abundance and suffers higher inactivation than e coli moreira et al 2016 2018 biancullo et al 2019 it is also noted that the selection of e coli as the target bacterium in this study was based on the fact that the latter is included in the proposal for a regulation of the european parliament and of the council on minimum requirements for water reuse eu 2019 the selection of smx and tmp to investigate the antibiotic resistance was based on their wide use and frequent detection in wastewater and aquatic environments the initial abundance of e coli in the secondary treated effluents was up to 8 103 cfu ml 1 the experiments were performed in triplicate for all the examined hrts and ozone concentrations the obtained results regarding the inactivation of total e coli fig 3 a indicated by absence of colonies in 100 ml of treated wastewater lod 0 01 cfu ml 1 were found using an hrt of 60 min for all the examined ozone concentrations similarly an hrt of 40 min was found to be adequate to inactivate e coli to values below lod for almost all tested ozone concentrations except 0 125 go3 g doc 1 for the hrt of 20 min the higher ozone concentration tested 0 75 go3 gdoc 1 was the only one able to inactivate e coli to values below the lod whereas inactivation was not attained when using an hrt of 10 min one study dealing with similar experimental conditions reported a 1 log reduction of e coli in a pilot scale ozonation reactor treating secondary treated effluents with an ozone dose up to 0 73 go3 gdoc 1 and a contact time of 20 min lÃ¼ddeke et al 2015 also ostoich et al 2013 reported the complete inactivation lod 0 01 cfu ml 1 of faecal coliforms by ozonation in a uwtp of italy using ozone doses varying from 10 to 15 mgo3 l 1 and a contact time of 30 min another study focusing on the inactivation of cultivable bacterial populations after batch mode ozonation under different contact times and ozone doses up to 50 g nm3 1 showed that the removal of total heterotrophs enterococci and coliforms including of antibiotic resistant e coli strain a2fcc14 was higher than 99 within 30 min of ozonation sousa et al 2017 the capacity of ozonation operated in continuous mode was also investigated in terms of its efficiency to inactivate antibiotic resistant e coli the obtained results fig s3 demonstrated the inactivation below lod of e coli harbouring resistance to tmp and smx by increasing hrts and applied ozone doses the inactivation of the examined arb occurred for hrts of 10 and 20 min and for ozone doses of 0 5 and 0 25 go3 gdoc 1 respectively the apparent observation that cultivable tmp and smx resistant e coli was lost earlier than the total cultivable e coli is probably due to the lower abundance of the first which had already reached the loq value indeed those results were expected due to the lower number of bacteria exhibiting resistance to tmp and smx it should be noted however that oxidizing agents i e o3 and ho might have led to the induction of a viable but not cultivable state vbnc in the bacteria explaining that non cultivable bacteria were detected in the presence of antibiotics michael kordatou et al 2017 observed that total e coli and ery resistant e coli were inactivated to values below loq within 15 min using an ozone dose of 0 3 mgo3 l 1 during batch mode ozonation oh et al 2016 investigated ozonation at batch mode with an ozone dose of 3 mgo3 l 1 for the potential inactivation of e coli containing the 64 508 bp nucleotide sequence of the inc p 1beta antibiotic resistance plasmid pb10 which has multiple resistance to a number of antibiotics it was shown that after 15 min of contact time the total and resistant e coli reduced by more than 90 alexander et al 2016 investigated the abundance of arb in wastewater effluents treated by ozonation 0 9 go3 gdoc 1 and hrt of 18 2 min with enterococcus spp exhibiting the highest susceptibility to ozone 98 reduction and p aeruginosa the highest tolerance moreira et al 2016 reported the inactivation to vales below loq of total heterotrophs and enterococcus spp as well as of bacteria harbouring resistance to ciprofloxacin gentamicin and meropenem after 26 min of treatment with ozone dose of 50 g nm3 1 in a lab scale continuous mode ozonation system the results obtained for the hrts of 10 and 20 min revealed the sensitivity of the indigenous e coli total cultivable and antibiotic resistant e coli towards the oxidizing agents o3 and ho this could be attributed to the physical vulnerability and the damage of the cell wall and membrane which may then lead to the cell lysis and consequent leakage of cell components to the external environment zuma et al 2009 dodd 2012 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 pak et al 2016 the regrowth potential of e coli was investigated for the two mildest operating conditions which led to their inactivation to levels below the loq just after treatment i e according to fig 3a hrt of 20 min and 0 75 go3 g doc 1 hrt of 40 min and 0 25 go3 g doc 1 the idea behind this approach was to understand the alterations on the faecal microbiota occurring in treated wastewater stored for reuse purposes incubation periods of 24 48 and 72 h and temperatures set at 24 1 c and 44 1 c were employed the selection of the incubation temperatures was made according to the environmental conditions environmental temperature 22 25 c and the maximal temperature tolerated by faecal coliforms namely e coli 44 45 c the environmental incubation temperature constitutes a more realistic approach concerning the regrowth potential of the treated samples whereas incubation at 44 c provided an indication on the potential of regrowth under a stressful temperature value fig 4 shows that ozonation operated under low ozone dose and high hrt was efficient to avoid the regrowth at 24 1 c whereas the experiments using higher ozone dose and lower hrt led to the regrowth of e coli at both temperatures suggesting that shorter contact time is a key factor determining the observed regrowth the results of this study indicated that low contact times at high ozone doses were not sufficient to induce non cultivability in the e coli wastewater population as consequence the microorganisms affected by ozone and ho maintained viability and therefore exhibited regrowth after a certain time period when the stress was relieved it is important to mention here that a high number of cells present in wastewater may be aggregated in flocs of different sizes hence inner bacterial cells may be protected from the deleterious effects of ozone and radicals therefore after treatment some cells can be injured and may need time to repair the damages depending on the extent of cell damage the time needed to recover may vary among surviving cells equally it is expected that they will not grow at the same rate according to the scientific literature lÃ¼ddeke et al 2015 pak et al 2016 marce et al 2017 jÃ¤ger et al 2018 ozonation time the applied ozone concentration the physical characteristics of the examined organisms and the wastewater composition are the major parameters affecting the bacterial regrowth after ozonation further experiments in the presence of ozone and h2o2 0 04 0 08 and 0 12 mm did not reveal significant differences in terms of e coli inactivation fig 3b in comparison to the experiments performed in the absence of h2o2 at the same experimental conditions hrt of 10 min ozone doses 0 125 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 go3 gdoc 1 specifically a slight reduction 5 was observed as the h2o2 concentration increased however this reduction falls within the statistical error of the measurements similar results were obtained for the inactivation of tmp and smx resistant e coli fig s4 it is important to note that the results obtained in the presence of h2o2 for the inactivation of total and resistant bacteria were in agreement with those observed in the case of the degradation of antibiotics i e the process efficiency was not affected by the addition of h2o2 hÃ¼bner et al 2012 investigated the bacteria inactivation in secondary treated effluents by ozonation with the addition of h2o2 and reported no differences after the addition of h2o2 similar results were also found by valero et al 2015 during the inactivation of enterococcus spp through ozonation in the presence and absence of h2o2 these findings can be attributed to the strong competition of h2o2 with the highly reactive moieties present in the defom occurring in the secondary treated effluents for consumption of ozone molecules pocostales et al 2010 miklos et al 2018 3 3 removal of selected genes and args continuous ozonation was evaluated with regard to its efficiency to remove selected genes and args three experimental conditions as mentioned previously section 2 7 were selected to assess the influence of the experimental parameters i e hrt and ozone dose towards the selected genes the housekeeping 16s rrna gene was used as a biomarker for bacteria aiming at assessing the reduction in the load of total bacteria class 1 integrons have been suggested as proxies for acquired antibiotic resistance in the environment gillings et al 2015 these genetic elements have conserved regions namely inti1 sul1 and qacÎ´e1 and a variable region which often includes genes such as aada1 or dfra1 ferreira da silva et al 2007 moura et al 2012 this study aimed at assessing the reduction of the abundance of inti1 and the conserved genes of the class 1 integrons and at investigating if ozonation led to gene excision herein indicated by a reduction in aada1 and dfra1 genes quantification was performed to understand how the produced oxidizing agents i e o3 and ho interact with the integrons and if the ozonation treatment is capable of efficiently disintegrating this mobile genetic element zhang et al 2009 the comparison between secondary treated effluent and ozonated samples showed that the reduction of the abundance of args bacterial load and inti1 were hrt and dose dependent an hrt of 40 min and 0 75 go3 gdoc 1 were found to be the optimum operating conditions for the reduction of the genes abundance fig 5 the log reduction varied between 2 and 3 3 4 and 4 6 for an hrt of 10 min and 0 25 go3 gdoc 1 hrt of 40 min and 0 25 go3 gdoc 1 and hrt of 40 min with 0 75 go3 gdoc 1 respectively the results revealed that when using an hrt of 40 min even when applying a low ozone dose the reduction of the abundance of the examined genes was similar to that achieved when using the higher ozone dose suggesting that an appropriate hrt would lead to the desired disintegration levels of the examined args even with low ozone doses ozone disinfection with an appropriate hrt and ozone dose is apparently enough to compromise dna integrity into a condition in which it could not act as pcr template these results are in agreement with the fact that once the bacteria cell surface is compromised by oxidizing agents and the cell interior is exposed to the external environment o3 and ho may interfere with dna von sonntag and von gunten 2012 dodd 2012 pak et al 2016 one important observation made in this study was that the resistant e coli decreased throughout ozonation whereas the reduction of the abundance of the selected genes observed after treatment was apparently transient the reactivation of the respective bacterial hosts may explain that in the samples treated with 0 25 go3 gdoc 1 and an hrt of 10 min the examined genes were detected after 72 h at almost the same levels as the initial values 1 log cycle below the initial under dark and ambient temperature 22 25 c fig 5 additionally from fig 6 which presents the relative abundance of the examined genes it can be observed that despite the detected reduction of the abundance of the examined args and integrase genes after the treatment an increase in the prevalence of these genetic determinants was detected 72 h after the treatment these observations were expected and are in accordance with the results presented in section 3 2 where no total inactivation of the examined bacteria was obtained for the same samples having in mind that the 16s rrna gene is a biomarker of the load of total bacteria its increase in the treated samples under all operating conditions tested implies that other bacterial groups thriving in wastewater e g aeromonads pseudomonads surviving ozonation have contributed to the increase of the abundance of the examined genes a recovery on the examined genes was also observed for the more severe experimental conditions of hrt and ozone dose these results could be explained through the assumption made by alexander et al 2016 who suggested that bacteria may develop different levels of robustness or resistance against oxidative stress additionally the high organic content of the wastewater table s2 may react with the majority of the produced oxidizing species resulting in a very small fraction able to cause lethal damages to the live cells existing in the medium alexander et al 2016 investigated the efficiency of ozonation treatment to inactivate selected args in a pilot scale system 18 2 min of hrt and ozone dose up to 0 9 0 1 go3 gdoc 1 and the obtained results showed variations of the examined genes removed through ozonation with args of vana bla vim ampc and ermb being reduced by 49 9 18 7 69 8 and 99 3 respectively zhuang et al 2015 reported a slight removal of the examined genes at low ozone doses using a bench scale system with ozone dose varying between 27 and 128 mg l 1 a fact that may be attributed to the rapid consumption of ozone by the organic matter present in wastewater e g cod 13 29 mgo2 l 1 also the inactivation of the selected genes observed by zhuang et al 2015 was found to be enhanced by increasing ozone doses and this is in line with the results presented in this study continuous mode ozonation experiments performed in synthetic and real wastewater samples with constant ozone dose for different contact times e g 15 30 and 60 min indicated that increasing contact time led to the inactivation of the selected genes e g 16s rrna gene inti1 bla tem qnrs and sul1 up to 99 in relation to the initial load before treatment after 30 min of exposure sousa et al 2017 in addition sousa et al 2017 showed that the regrowth after 72 h of incubation occurred for samples treated for 15 and 30 min whereas no reactivation was observed after 60 min suggesting that this period of contact time was adequate to kill the majority of the cells however in the real wastewater samples which are characterized by higher microbial diversity and chemical complexity compared to synthetic wastewater the inactivation efficiency and the regrowth potential in the examined samples were lower and more intense respectively this may be ascribed to the fact that the structural organization of the bacterial cells is different with real wastewater containing a high number of aggregated cells forming flocs of different dimensions it is already known that the suspended solids the defom and the complexity of the microbiota in the wastewater may be the major factors explaining the variations of the efficiency of ozonation treatment zhuang et al 2015 sousa et al 2017 the fluctuation of the wastewater qualitative characteristics can influence the reaction mechanism of ozone affecting thus the overall disinfection efficiency towards the living cells in uwtps although not covered in this study according to pak et al 2016 damage of the surface of the cells by ozonation may lead to the release of dna if relatively intact args containing free fragments may be transferred to other microorganisms through horizontal mechanisms and contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance all those factors seemed to have influence on the ozonation efficiency and more detailed studies are needed to identify the proper conditions required to achieve the optimum performance of the ozonation treatment in terms of genes and args inactivation 3 4 mineralization and phytotoxicity assessment fig 7 a shows the results for the mineralization observed in the treated effluents in terms of doc removal it must be pointed out that the contribution of the antibiotics to the doc of the spiked wastewater effluent was negligible since the doc of the samples varied between 18 2 and 21 2 mg l 1 table s2 whereas the theoretical doc corresponding to the 8 spiked antibiotics was 0 45 mg l 1 3 a significant improvement was observed when increasing both the ozone dose and hrt specifically when applying an ozone dose of 0 25 go3 gdoc 1 and hrt of 10 min doc removal was found to be 10 12 whereas an ozone dose of 0 75 go3 gdoc 1 and hrt of 60 min led to doc removal up to 25 several studies are in line with the results presented herein and many of them attributed the low yield of mineralization to the formation of recalcitrant organic intermediates deriving from the oxidation of defom originally present in wastewater von sonntag and von gunten 2012 margot et al 2013 prieto rodrÃ­guez et al 2013 rodrÃ­guez chueca et al 2015 marce et al 2016 michael kordatou et al 2017 in a pilot scale study dealing with ozonation of secondary treated effluents liu et al 2014 reported a doc removal up to 28 after 30 min of contact time using an ozone concentration of 4 mg l 1 carbajo et al 2015 observed 35 of doc removal even using 130 mg l 1 of ozone and a contact time of 20 min no remarkable differences were found for doc removal by adding h2o2 fig 7b and this is in accordance to the results observed for the antibiotics in section 3 1 suggesting that h2o2 did not improve the removal of the oxidation products formed during ozonation in this work it was clearly shown that the degradation of the parent antibiotic compounds down to their limit of detection required mild ozone doses while under these conditions the reduction of the organic matter in terms of cod and doc was low 15 25 defom contains a variety of organic compounds that during their reaction with ozone and hydroxyl radicals may lead to the formation of persistent oxidation products these products may be not susceptible to ozone and can be even more toxic than the initial compounds phytotoxicity tests using three plants species lepidium sativum sinapis alba and sorghum saccharatum were considered suitable to evaluate the toxicity of the treated wastewater before its use for agriculture irrigation rizzo 2011 to evaluate the phytotoxicity of the treated samples and assess the influence of the ozone dose and hrt three experimental conditions reported in section 3 3 were selected the phytotoxicity of the treated samples towards l sativum s alba and s saccharatum was expressed as percentage of inhibition in the seed germination gi shoot germination si and root growth ri the experiments were conducted using wastewater effluent samples as collected fig 8 a and b and the same samples spiked with the target antibiotics fig 8c and d in order to elucidate the role of the oxidation products formed during ozonation in the phytotoxicity against the three plants species the raw wastewater samples did not cause any gi whereas an inhibition effect was observed in the ozonated samples with s saccharatum being the only seed showing a gi in the three sets of experiments fig s5 the main finding of the phytotoxicity assessment fig 8 was that the higher ozone doses or contact times increased the phytotoxicity levels of the treated samples the inhibition expressed as si and ri percentages in the spiked experiments were higher than those observed in the non spiked experiments according to fig 8 the highest si and ri were observed in the experiment applying ozone dose of 0 75 go3 gdoc 1 with hrt of 40 min these results are in agreement with those obtained by michael kordatou et al 2017 showing that ozonation resulted in the augmentation of the phytotoxicity i e root and shoot inhibition even after 15 min of treatment indicating that defom oxidation products were potentially more toxic than the original matrix this behaviour might be due to direct oxidation of various organic constituents present in the defom of the wastewater samples or to their oxidation via a hydroxyl radical mediated mechanism the high values of doc and cod of secondary treated effluent used for the implementation of the experiments are an indication of the existence of those organic constituents it is well known that a number of oxidation products can be formed during ozonation from the oxidation of both the examined antibiotics and the defom present in the secondary treated wastewater effluents von sonntag and von gunten 2012 lee and von gunten 2016 michael kordatou et al 2017 in fact the low doc removal could be correlated with the existence of ozonation products in the treated samples which could contribute to the increased phytotoxicity of the samples also results obtained from other studies using a variety of toxicological tests indicated that ozonation may cause other biological effects e g toxicity and genotoxicity stalter et al 2010 the above findings clearly indicate that the ozonation treatment is insufficient to completely mineralize the wastewater and poses risks of producing oxidation products with potentially phytotoxic effects in particular when the most severe operating conditions are tested considering that nowadays ozonation finds an increasing application in full scale uwtps more research should be performed on this issue in order to identify the specific oxidation products that may be responsible for the observed phytotoxic effects 4 conclusions the findings of this study demonstrated that ozonation of wastewater operated at continuous mode constitutes a promising treatment technology for the elimination of the selected a arb args the results revealed that low ozone doses accompanied by prolonged treatment time was needed to eliminate the parent compounds of the examined antibiotics to concentration below their lod in the spiked experiments whereas the mildest conditions i e lower hrt of 10 min for the same ozone dose of 0 125 go3 gdoc 1 were sufficient to degrade the parent compounds in the non spiked experiments no substantial mineralization was observed at the end of the treatment time at all experimental conditions examined a fact that may explain the enhanced phytotoxicity of the ozonated samples towards the tested plant species ozonation operated at high hrt and ozone doses hrt 40 min 0 25 go3 gdoc 1 was capable of inactivating total as well as tmp or smx resistant e coli with the simultaneous reduction of the abundance of the examined genes however regrowth cannot be avoided after ozonation as it was demonstrated that living cells might still exist in the treated samples even after prolonged treatment overall it was shown that ozonation upon its proper optimisation constitutes an efficient treatment option for the removal of antibiotic related microcontaminants from wastewater effluents nevertheless it is suggested that after ozonation post treatment by biological filtration or activated carbon adsorption may overcome the main limitations of this process in relation to phytotoxicity also more studies are needed to establish conditions capable of limiting regrowth of arb after ozonation these efforts will contribute to improving the quality of the treated wastewater while minimising the potential risks of spread of antibiotic resistance in the receiving environment acknowledgments this paper is part of a project that has received funding from the european union s

the process with respect to the inactivation of escherichia coli and antibiotic resistant e coli as well as to the reduction of the abundance of selected antibiotic resistance genes args the inactivation of total cultivable e coli was achieved under the experimental conditions of hrt 40 min and 0 25 go3 gdoc 1 at which all antibiotic compounds were already degraded the regrowth

args intl1 aada1 dfra1 qaceÎ´1 and sul1 was found to decrease with increasing hrt and ozone dose despite the fact that the mildest operating parameters were able to eliminate the parent compounds of the tested antibiotics in wastewater effluents it was clearly demonstrated in this study that higher ozone doses were required in order to confer permanent damage and or death and prevent potential post treatment re growth of both total bacteria and arb and to reduce the abundance of args below the loq interestingly the mineralization of wastewater in terms of dissolved organic carbon doc removal was found to be significantly low even when the higher ozone doses were applied leading to an increased phytotoxicity towards various plant species the findings of this study clearly underline

phytotoxicity ozonation continuous mode 1 introduction nowadays the ecosystems and the human health are threatened by the environmental occurrence of both chemical and biological contaminants of emerging concern cecs such as antibiotics and acquired antibiotic resistance genes args mobilized by antibiotic resistant bacteria arb arb args are considered as a serious public health problem by various international organizations and the european union eu because of their widespread in the environment food chain and even drinking water among others rizzo et al 2013 berendonk et al 2015 recently the environmental dimension of antimicrobial resistance has been identified as one of the six emerging issues of environmental concern according to the united nations environment unep 2017 apha 2005 in fact arb can often do work synergistically by interacting with each other in a variety of mechanisms that enhance remarkably their collective capability to transfer args leading to antibiotic resistance described two decades ago by salyers and amabile cuevas 1997 as an easy to get hard to lose phenomenon in the face of regional and global antibiotic resistance challenges the european commission stands at the forefront for intensifying its efforts to shape a relevant legislative instrument with regard to the minimum quality criteria for the assessment of reclaimed wastewater intended for agricultural irrigation and aquifer recharge including antibiotic resistance and related risks eu 2017a in the last decade urban wastewater treatment plants uwtps have been considered as critical hotspots for the propagation of antibiotic resistance in the environment with the consequences being potentially compounded by the reuse of treated wastewater the fact that uwtps are not specifically designed for the elimination of antibiotic compounds michael et al 2013 accompanied by an increase in the prevalence of arb and their associated args has triggered an imperative need to improve the efficiency of the existing treatment processes pruden 2013 karkman et al 2017 michael kordatou et al 2018 manaia et al 2018 in this sense various advanced chemical oxidation processes aops have been extensively investigated to efficiently remove antibiotic residues michael et al 2013 inactivate arb and remove args from wastewater effluents at bench pilot and full scale applications zhuang et al 2015 alexander et al 2016 czekalski et al 2016 ferro et al 2016 lee and von gunten 2016 sousa et al 2017 karaolia et al 2018 in a recent review michael kordatou et al 2018 investigated the fate of arb args during aops the key operating conditions affecting their efficiency to inactivate arb and remove args and the main oxidative damage pathways involved in these processes indicating that besides the operating conditions the variable behavior observed by the various examined genetic constituents of the microbial community may be directed by the process distinct oxidative damage mechanisms in place during the application of each treatment technology a great deal of interest has been focused on the application of ozone based systems which have been demonstrated to be effective in achieving significant abatement of various microcontaminants while also providing sufficient disinfection of wastewater at different ozone doses and contact times von gunten 2003 2018 ikehata et al 2006 in fact the knowledge on the efficiency of ozonation to eliminate arb args is limited since most studies performed so far only focused on the effect of ozone on cultivable bacterial populations with the effect of the process on arb or args being still unclear michael kordatou et al 2018 ozone is a powerful oxidant and has been widely used during the last years for the treatment of wastewater it reacts selectively with organic compounds via a direct reaction with ozone molecules or through an indirect pathway with hydroxyl radicals ho under alkaline ph conditions which result from ozone decay in water and wastewater ozonation has been shown to have a high potential for the oxidation of a variety of pharmaceutical compounds including antibiotics and the inactivation of total pathogenic bacteria in drinking water and wastewater antoniou et al 2013 von gunten 2018 the few studies published so far suggest that ozonation is effective to inactivate arb and remove args and also to eliminate the potential bacterial regrowth under proper optimized conditions specific ozone dose and exposure time michael kordatou et al 2018 however further studies are necessary to fill in the gaps of knowledge in relation to the effectiveness of ozonation to the inactivation of arb and the reduction of the abundance of args within this context the aim of the present work was to investigate and optimize the efficiency of ozonation operated in continuous mode for the abatement of a diverse array of antibiotic related chemical and microbiological microcontaminants from secondary treated wastewater effluents the objectives of this study were to assess i the removal of a mixture of eight antibiotics belonging to different classes and exhibiting different physicochemical properties being the macrolides included in the eu watch list of substances for union wide monitoring eu 2017b eu 2018 namely azithromycin azm erythromycin ery clarithromycin cla as well as ampicillin amp ofloxacin ofl sulfamethoxazole smx trimethoprim tmp and tetracycline tc ii the inactivation of wastewater autochthonous total and antibiotic resistant escherichia coli and to further evaluate their regrowth potential after treatment iii the reduction of the abundance of selected genes originally present in wastewater specifically the bacterial biomarker 16s rrna the class 1 integron integrase inti1 and args i e qacÎ´e1 sul1 aada1 and dfra1 iv the extent of mineralization of the treated wastewater and v the evolution of phytotoxicity against selected plant species according to the authors knowledge this work is among the first studies revealing comprehensive data regarding the oxidation of a mixture of antibiotics rather than one compound at environmentally low concentrations rather than high concentrations during the application of ozonation in continuous mode rather in batch mode simulating thus a more realistic scenario from the uwtp full scale perspective combined with the assessment of the process in removing arb args rather than evaluating only the disinfection efficiency in relation to the inactivation of various bacterial groups and phytotoxicity the results obtained by existing studies performed on the ozonation of wastewater table s1 may be sometimes contradictory while in many cases the lack and or heterogeneity of the scientific data e g different target microcontaminants different experimental configurations etc as well as the different methodological approaches applied in the various studies make difficult the accurate evaluation of the efficiency of the ozonation the innovation of this study lies in the fact that it evaluates the efficiency of ozonation operated in continuous mode in relation to the simultaneous removal of both chemical i e antibiotics and biological i e arb args microcontaminants as well as phytotoxicity which is another important parameter when wastewater reuse in crop irrigation is considered also this is one of the very first attempts made to investigate if the variable region of class1 integrons might undergo excision after exposure to ozone herein indicated by a

procedure ozonation experiments were performed in a continuous mode through a flow through reactor where untreated wastewater effluents were pumped on a continuous basis and treated samples were exiting continuously a cylindrical borosilicate bubble column reactor fig 1 a 3 0 cm internal diameter i d 70 cm height useful volume of approximately 310 ml packed with ca 400 glass rings was used in order to promote the contact between the gas phase and wastewater increasing the mass transfer of ozone the use of borosilicate in the reactor column ensured that no adsorption desorption of the examined compounds on the reactor walls occurred this material has been widely used in ozonation reactors mecha et al 2017 orhon et al 2017 rozas et al 2017 also the borosilicate bubble column provides the possibility of visual contact in the reactor to avoid any malfunctions during the performance of the experiments regardless of the type of experiment performed the reactor was always filled with ultrapure water and the experiments commenced t 0 0 min when the wastewater to be treated was pumped into the reactor through the peristaltic pump fig 1b being diluted until achieving steady state conditions preliminary experiments through conductivity measurements with a tracer solution of nacl concentration of 2 000 mg l 1 were performed to determine the time required to achieve the steady state for each hrt fig s1 for the examined hrts i e 10 20 40 and 60 min the inlet liquid flow rate varied between 40 and 6 ml min 1 according to fig 1 the wastewater effluents were continuously entering the reactor by the bottom of the column fig 1c and leaving it from its top fig 1d the efficiency of the process was estimated after achieving the steady state for each selected hrt a bmt 802x ozone generator fig 1e was used to produce ozone from pure oxygen the desired ozone concentration was produced through the adjustment of the o2 gas flow rate which varied from 20 to 160 ml min 1 adjusted by a mass flow controller fig 1f and the electric intensity of the ozone generator the ozone concentration was normalised to the doc values of each sample at each treatment time

ozone escaping the reactor in the gas phase was carefully removed by gas washing bottles filled with a ki solution fig 1g two sets of experiments were performed using 1 wastewater effluents as collected and 2 wastewater effluents spiked with the mixture of the selected antibiotics moreover experiments with the addition of h2o2 at different concentrations i e 0 0 04 0 08 and 0 12 mm were also performed the selected concentrations were based on previous studies valero et al 2015 in an attempt to optimize the concentration of h2o2 able to enhance the degradation efficiency of pollutants

and manaia 2010 michael et al 2012 the chromogenic agar of tryptone bile x glucuronide t bx sigma aldrich steinhein germany was used for the detection and enumeration of escherichia coli for the enumeration of arb the medium was spiked with tmp or smx at concentrations of 16 or 516 mg l 1 respectively these concentrations were chosen based on the minimum inhibitory concentration mic of each of the examined antibiotics as determined in the clinical and laboratory standards institute clsi wayne 2007 serial dilutions of each sample were prepared in a saline solution nacl 0 85 and filtered through mixed cellulose ester membranes 0 22 Î¼m pore size millipore which were placed onto the culture medium and incubated for 24 h at 44 1 c for e coli bacteria counts expressed as colony forming units per ml cfu ml were enumerated on the respective culture media with the limit of quantification loq of e coli being equal to 1 cfu 100 ml 1 since 100 ml was the maximum volume filtered the prevalence of antibiotic resistant e coli was assumed as the ratio of cfu ml 1 observed on the medium containing the antibiotic and that cfu ml 1 on the medium without antibiotic as described elsewhere novo and manaia 2010 karaolia et al 2017 additionally the regrowth potential of the examined bacterial groups was investigated in ozonated samples in which the examined bacterial groups were at levels below loq regrowth was examined after 24 48 or 72 h of storage in the dark at both 24 1 c and 44 1 c this investigation took place in order to examine whether the reduction of the examined bacterial groups denoted their permanent inactivation or if it was a transient effect of injury and temporary inactivation with regrowth after some time for repair reactivation the examination of the ozonation regrowth capacity aimed at giving insights on the potential bacterial regrowth after treatment in order to have an indication of what could happen in terms of faecal contamination if the treated wastewater was discharged in a natural receiving environment or stored to be used for reuse purposes 2 6 quantification of selected args total genomic dna was used to monitor selected genes and args in the treated samples obtained from different experimental runs performed at different operating conditions the genes examined to this study were the four args of aada1 dfra1 qaceÎ´1 and sul1 the class 1 integron integrase inti1 and the housekeeping gene of 16s rrna the reasons of selecting these genes args are provided in section 3 3 three sets of experimental conditions were selected to assess the effect of the experimental parameters i e hrt and specific ozone dose on the reduction of the abundance of the selected genes i 0 25 g o3 gdoc 1 and hrt of 10 min which can be considered as a realistic scenario in a full scale uwtp with many studies in the literature reporting these conditions ii 0 75 go3 gdoc 1 and hrt of 40 min which were the optimum conditions determined in this study for the degradation of the target antibiotics and the bacterial inactivation and iii 0 25 go3 gdoc 1 and hrt of 40 min in order to examine the influence of lower ozone dose along with higher contact time the total genomic dna extraction was performed using the powerwater dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc following filtration of the samples volume 900 1000 ml through polycarbonate filter membranes 45 mm diameter 0 22 Î¼m pore size millipore dna quantification was assessed using a qubit 3 0 fluorometer thermofisher scientific quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr stepone tm real time pcr system lifetechnologies carlsbad ca usa using sybr green chemistry was employed to measure the abundance per ml of sample of aada1 dfra1 qaceÎ´1 and sul1 inti1 and 16s rrna calibration curves based on adequate ten fold dilution series of the standards for the respective gene were run along with the test samples primers information and qpcr conditions are listed in table 2 2 7 phytotoxicity assays the phytotoxicity assessment of samples collected before and after the ozonation treatment at the same experimental conditions mentioned in section 2 6 was carried out in triplicate using the phytotestkit microbiotest microbiotests inc the selection of this phytotoxicity assay among various toxicity tests aimed at providing evidence on the suitability of the ozonation process as a tertiary treatment for wastewater effluents intended for reuse in agricultural irrigation the following plants were used in this assay due to their rapid germination and growth of roots and shoots and their sensitivity to low concentrations of phytotoxic substances monocotyl sorgho sorghum saccharatum dicotyl garden cress lepidium sativum and dicotyl mustard sinapis alba a control test was performed using tap water the data interpretation is extensively described elsewhere michael et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of antibiotics the efficiency of the ozonation process operated in continuous mode in degrading the target antibiotics was assessed under various hrts i e 10 20 40 and 60 min and specific ozone concentrations i e 0 125 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 go3 gdoc 1 these conditions i e hrts and ozone doses were selected based on the findings of previous studies dealing with the application of ozonation for the removal of various organic microcontaminants reungoat et al 2012 prieto rodrÃ­guez et al 2013 margot et al 2013 marce et al 2016 sousa et al 2017 and taking into account the full scale applicability of the process in relation to the operating cost the latter was taken into consideration by applying the lowest ozone dose able to effectively eliminate the examined compounds under continuous mode operation the results revealed that the spiked antibiotics in mixture were efficiently degraded 99 by ozonation applying both hrts of 40 and 60 min at all examined ozone concentrations figs s2c and d for the lower hrts of 10 min and 20 min with an ozone dose of 0 125 go3 gdoc 1 figs s2a and b only smx ofl and tc were degraded rapidly below the lod while amp azm cla ery and tmp were degraded up to 84 73 98 70 and 96 respectively when gradually increasing the ozone dose the elimination of the parent compounds of all antibiotics was shown to slightly increase for both hrts of 10 and 20 min 10 min this behaviour was expected even at low ozone doses since this oxidant is able to either selectively attack double bonds and molecules containing electron rich moieties present in the different classes of the examined antibiotic compounds e g macrolides sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones or develop a radical oxidation pathway due to its self decomposition at the natural ph of the wastewater ph 7 3 7 8 considering that the experiments were conducted at the inherent ph of the wastewater effluents it can be assumed that the elimination of the parent compounds was predominantly driven by ho rather than the direct reaction with molecular o3 michael kordatou et al 2017 the results presented herein are consistent with those reported in other relevant scientific studies using different reactor configurations and applying different ozone concentrations reungoat et al 2012 lee et al 2013 margot et al 2013 prieto rodrÃ­guez et al 2013 for instance lee et al 2013 reported a degradation higher than 90 for tmp and smx in secondary treated effluents treated by a bench scale semi continuous ozonation another similar bench scale study using ozonation at semi operation mode demonstrated that the elimination of the parent compounds of sulfonamide and macrolide antibiotics spiked in ultrapure water and in pharmaceutical wastewater effluents was achieved in less than 20 min lin et al 2009 in a pilot scale ozonation study 0 32 1 23 go3 gdoc 1 hrts up to 20 min margot et al 2013 reported the removal of 40 microcontaminants including azm cla tmp and smx over 80 from secondary treated wastewater effluents a removal of 90 of microcontaminants including cla ery ofl smx and tmp from secondary treated effluents was reported after a treatment time of 20 min using pilot scale ozonation operating in a semi continuous mode 0 19 go3 gdoc 1 prieto rodrÃ­guez et al 2013 similar results were reported by reungoat et al 2010 in a study dealing with full scale ozonation 5 mgo3 l 1 and hrt 15 min of secondary treated wastewater among the 25 selected microcontaminants quantified in the samples 9 showed a reduction of more than 90 including ery tmp and smx and 13 others were reduced by more than 70 overall the degradation of the parent compounds of the antibiotics was improved with increasing the hrt and ozone dose as expected according to the aforementioned results obtained from the spiked experiments the hrt of 40 min could be considered as optimum since it allowed to achieve a rapid and complete elimination of the parent compounds of all the examined antibiotics at Î¼g l 1 level even when using the lowest applied ozone dose of 0 125 go3 gdoc 1 fig s2 however considering that the application of ozonation at a full scale uwtp for 40 min is not cost effective and that no significant differences were found between the different applied ozone concentrations for the hrts of 10 and 20 min a new set of experiments was carried out to determine the optimum experimental conditions with respect to the antibiotics degradation at the lowest hrts of 10 and 20 min by examining the contribution of the addition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to the overall process efficiency the degradation of the target antibiotics was investigated by comparing single ozonation absence of h2o2 and ozonation assisted by the addition of h2o2 at different concentrations i e 0 04 0 08 and 0 12 mm which were selected according to the findings reported in previous studies cho and yoon 2006 lanao et al 2008 valero et al 2015 the addition of h2o2 to the ozonation process leads to the so called peroxone process o3 h2o2 which is expected to promote higher removals of organic compounds than single ozonation due to the enhanced ozone decay and production rate of ho von gunten 2003 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 fig 2 shows the effect of the addition of h2o2 on the degradation of each antibiotic by ozonation for the hrt of 10 min as a function of the applied ozone concentration it can be observed in fig 2b d that the increase of the oxidant concentration had a marginal influence on the degradation of the examined antibiotics the results obtained in this study revealed that the removal of the antibiotics which were not completely degraded by single ozonation amp azm and ery was similar with that observed when applying the o3 h2o2 process for all the tested concentrations of h2o2 amp azm and ery were not completely removed after 10 min of treatment under all the tested ozone doses and h2o2 concentrations and their removal percentages by single o3 and combined o3 h2o2 treatments was differed only by 2 3 this may be caused by the rapid consumption of ozone by dissolved effluent organic matter defom when using low specific ozone doses go3 gdoc 1 0 5 this reaction outcompetes the relatively slow reaction of ozone with h2o2 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 lee et al 2014 miklos et al 2018 similarly acero and von gunten 2001 also reported the effect of the wastewater qualitative parameters on the efficiency of ozonation and o3 h2o2 several studies have reported similar findings indicating that the enrichment of the ozonation reaction with h2o2 slightly affected the degradation of microcontaminants for instance lee et al 2013 reported negligible variations when adding h2o2 in wastewater the h2o2 o3 molar ratio and ozone doses ranged between 0 5 1 0 and 0 25 1 5 go3 gdoc 1 respectively when using a lab scale ozone reactor operating in batch mode to examine the degradation of 16 microcontaminants including tmp and smx in secondary treated effluents similar results were obtained in the study of lee et al 2014 who reported that the removal of the tested microcontaminants during o3 h2o2 process increased only slightly 10 by the addition of h2o2 molar ratio h2o2 o3 0 0 25 and 0 5 in a pilot scale ozonation 0 64 1 08 go3 gdoc 1 hrts 12 23 min addition of h2o2 up to 2 5 mg l 1 kovalova et al 2013 reported a negligible improvement of 10 for microcontaminants elimination by o3 h2o2 in comparison to single ozonation therefore these results showed that the addition of h2o2 which would increase the operating cost of the process did not enhance remarkably the degradation of the examined compounds however it is important to mention that in the experiments performed with non spiked wastewater effluents inherent antibiotics concentrations even the mildest experimental conditions tested with single ozonation hrt of 10 min and 0 125 go3 gdoc 1 were found to be able to provide a removal of the examined microcontaminants table 1 to concentrations below their limit of detection in order to investigate whether the mildest ozonation conditions were adequate towards the inactivation of arb and removal of args a new series of optimization experiments was performed with varying ozone doses and hrts as discussed in the following sections 3 2 inactivation of total and antibiotic resistant cultivable escherichia coli the ozonation process operated in continuous mode was investigated with regard to its efficiency to inactivate the total and antibiotic resistant cultivable e coli the selection of e coli was based on its role as indicator of microbiological contamination e coli and faecal coliforms in general are used worldwide as indicators of faecal contamination in particular to assess the microbiological water wastewater quality and are included in the wastewater legislation for reuse purposes apha 2005 iso9308 1 2000 e coli are excreted in faeces and consequently they reach uwtps where they can survive and thrive throughout the cas treatment forster et al 2002 wellington et al 2013 karaolia et al 2017 therefore the ubiquity of these bacteria in human impacted environments together with their persistence in the environment as well as genome plasticity make them important tracers to assess the antibiotic resistance status of environmental samples additionally in previous studies including both gram negative and gram positive faecal indicator bacteria e coli and enterococcus spp respectively noteworthy differences were not observed regarding their inactivation comparing both groups enterococcus spp has usually lower abundance and suffers higher inactivation than e coli moreira et al 2016 2018 biancullo et al 2019 it is also noted that the selection of e coli as the target bacterium in this study was based on the fact that the latter is included in the proposal for a regulation of the european parliament and of the council on minimum requirements for water reuse eu 2019 the selection of smx and tmp to investigate the antibiotic resistance was based on their wide use and frequent detection in wastewater and aquatic environments the initial abundance of e coli in the secondary treated effluents was up to 8 103 cfu ml 1 the experiments were performed in triplicate for all the examined hrts and ozone concentrations the obtained results regarding the inactivation of total e coli fig 3 a indicated by absence of colonies in 100 ml of treated wastewater lod 0 01 cfu ml 1 were found using an hrt of 60 min for all the examined ozone concentrations similarly an hrt of 40 min was found to be adequate to inactivate e coli to values below lod for almost all tested ozone concentrations except 0 125 go3 g doc 1 for the hrt of 20 min the higher ozone concentration tested 0 75 go3 gdoc 1 was the only one able to inactivate e coli to values below the lod whereas inactivation was not attained when using an hrt of 10 min one study dealing with similar experimental conditions reported a 1 log reduction of e coli in a pilot scale ozonation reactor treating secondary treated effluents with an ozone dose up to 0 73 go3 gdoc 1 and a contact time of 20 min lÃ¼ddeke et al 2015 also ostoich et al 2013 reported the complete inactivation lod 0 01 cfu ml 1 of faecal coliforms by ozonation in a uwtp of italy using ozone doses varying from 10 to 15 mgo3 l 1 and a contact time of 30 min another study focusing on the inactivation of cultivable bacterial populations after batch mode ozonation under different contact times and ozone doses up to 50 g nm3 1 showed that the removal of total heterotrophs enterococci and coliforms including of antibiotic resistant e coli strain a2fcc14 was higher than 99 within 30 min of ozonation sousa et al 2017 the capacity of ozonation operated in continuous mode was also investigated in terms of its efficiency to inactivate antibiotic resistant e coli the obtained results fig s3 demonstrated the inactivation below lod of e coli harbouring resistance to tmp and smx by increasing hrts and applied ozone doses the inactivation of the examined arb occurred for hrts of 10 and 20 min and for ozone doses of 0 5 and 0 25 go3 gdoc 1 respectively the apparent observation that cultivable tmp and smx resistant e coli was lost earlier than the total cultivable e coli is probably due to the lower abundance of the first which had already reached the loq value indeed those results were expected due to the lower number of bacteria exhibiting resistance to tmp and smx it should be noted however that oxidizing agents i e o3 and ho might have led to the induction of a viable but not cultivable state vbnc in the bacteria explaining that non cultivable bacteria were detected in the presence of antibiotics michael kordatou et al 2017 observed that total e coli and ery resistant e coli were inactivated to values below loq within 15 min using an ozone dose of 0 3 mgo3 l 1 during batch mode ozonation oh et al 2016 investigated ozonation at batch mode with an ozone dose of 3 mgo3 l 1 for the potential inactivation of e coli containing the 64 508 bp nucleotide sequence of the inc p 1beta antibiotic resistance plasmid pb10 which has multiple resistance to a number of antibiotics it was shown that after 15 min of contact time the total and resistant e coli reduced by more than 90 alexander et al 2016 investigated the abundance of arb in wastewater effluents treated by ozonation 0 9 go3 gdoc 1 and hrt of 18 2 min with enterococcus spp exhibiting the highest susceptibility to ozone 98 reduction and p aeruginosa the highest tolerance moreira et al 2016 reported the inactivation to vales below loq of total heterotrophs and enterococcus spp as well as of bacteria harbouring resistance to ciprofloxacin gentamicin and meropenem after 26 min of treatment with ozone dose of 50 g nm3 1 in a lab scale continuous mode ozonation system the results obtained for the hrts of 10 and 20 min revealed the sensitivity of the indigenous e coli total cultivable and antibiotic resistant e coli towards the oxidizing agents o3 and ho this could be attributed to the physical vulnerability and the damage of the cell wall and membrane which may then lead to the cell lysis and consequent leakage of cell components to the external environment zuma et al 2009 dodd 2012 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 pak et al 2016 the regrowth potential of e coli was investigated for the two mildest operating conditions which led to their inactivation to levels below the loq just after treatment i e according to fig 3a hrt of 20 min and 0 75 go3 g doc 1 hrt of 40 min and 0 25 go3 g doc 1 the idea behind this approach was to understand the alterations on the faecal microbiota occurring in treated wastewater stored for reuse purposes incubation periods of 24 48 and 72 h and temperatures set at 24 1 c and 44 1 c were employed the selection of the incubation temperatures was made according to the environmental conditions environmental temperature 22 25 c and the maximal temperature tolerated by faecal coliforms namely e coli 44 45 c the environmental incubation temperature constitutes a more realistic approach concerning the regrowth potential of the treated samples whereas incubation at 44 c provided an indication on the potential of regrowth under a stressful temperature value fig 4 shows that ozonation operated under low ozone dose and high hrt was efficient to avoid the regrowth at 24 1 c whereas the experiments using higher ozone dose and lower hrt led to the regrowth of e coli at both temperatures suggesting that shorter contact time is a key factor determining the observed regrowth the results of this study indicated that low contact times at high ozone doses were not sufficient to induce non cultivability in the e coli wastewater population as consequence the microorganisms affected by ozone and ho maintained viability and therefore exhibited regrowth after a certain time period when the stress was relieved it is important to mention here that a high number of cells present in wastewater may be aggregated in flocs of different sizes hence inner bacterial cells may be protected from the deleterious effects of ozone and radicals therefore after treatment some cells can be injured and may need time to repair the damages depending on the extent of cell damage the time needed to recover may vary among surviving cells equally it is expected that they will not grow at the same rate according to the scientific literature lÃ¼ddeke et al 2015 pak et al 2016 marce et al 2017 jÃ¤ger et al 2018 ozonation time the applied ozone concentration the physical characteristics of the examined organisms and the wastewater composition are the major parameters affecting the bacterial regrowth after ozonation further experiments in the presence of ozone and h2o2 0 04 0 08 and 0 12 mm did not reveal significant differences in terms of e coli inactivation fig 3b in comparison to the experiments performed in the absence of h2o2 at the same experimental conditions hrt of 10 min ozone doses 0 125 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 go3 gdoc 1 specifically a slight reduction 5 was observed as the h2o2 concentration increased however this reduction falls within the statistical error of the measurements similar results were obtained for the inactivation of tmp and smx resistant e coli fig s4 it is important to note that the results obtained in the presence of h2o2 for the inactivation of total and resistant bacteria were in agreement with those observed in the case of the degradation of antibiotics i e the process efficiency was not affected by the addition of h2o2 hÃ¼bner et al 2012 investigated the bacteria inactivation in secondary treated effluents by ozonation with the addition of h2o2 and reported no differences after the addition of h2o2 similar results were also found by valero et al 2015 during the inactivation of enterococcus spp through ozonation in the presence and absence of h2o2 these findings can be attributed to the strong competition of h2o2 with the highly reactive moieties present in the defom occurring in the secondary treated effluents for consumption of ozone molecules pocostales et al 2010 miklos et al 2018 3 3 removal of selected genes and args continuous ozonation was evaluated with regard to its efficiency to remove selected genes and args three experimental conditions as mentioned previously section 2 7 were selected to assess the influence of the experimental parameters i e hrt and ozone dose towards the selected genes the housekeeping 16s rrna gene was used as a biomarker for bacteria aiming at assessing the reduction in the load of total bacteria class 1 integrons have been suggested as proxies for acquired antibiotic resistance in the environment gillings et al 2015 these genetic elements have conserved regions namely inti1 sul1 and qacÎ´e1 and a variable region which often includes genes such as aada1 or dfra1 ferreira da silva et al 2007 moura et al 2012 this study aimed at assessing the reduction of the abundance of inti1 and the conserved genes of the class 1 integrons and at investigating if ozonation led to gene excision herein indicated by a reduction in aada1 and dfra1 genes quantification was performed to understand how the produced oxidizing agents i e o3 and ho interact with the integrons and if the ozonation treatment is capable of efficiently disintegrating this mobile genetic element zhang et al 2009 the comparison between secondary treated effluent and ozonated samples showed that the reduction of the abundance of args bacterial load and inti1 were hrt and dose dependent an hrt of 40 min and 0 75 go3 gdoc 1 were found to be the optimum operating conditions for the reduction of the genes abundance fig 5 the log reduction varied between 2 and 3 3 4 and 4 6 for an hrt of 10 min and 0 25 go3 gdoc 1 hrt of 40 min and 0 25 go3 gdoc 1 and hrt of 40 min with 0 75 go3 gdoc 1 respectively the results revealed that when using an hrt of 40 min even when applying a low ozone dose the reduction of the abundance of the examined genes was similar to that achieved when using the higher ozone dose suggesting that an appropriate hrt would lead to the desired disintegration levels of the examined args even with low ozone doses ozone disinfection with an appropriate hrt and ozone dose is apparently enough to compromise dna integrity into a condition in which it could not act as pcr template these results are in agreement with the fact that once the bacteria cell surface is compromised by oxidizing agents and the cell interior is exposed to the external environment o3 and ho may interfere with dna von sonntag and von gunten 2012 dodd 2012 pak et al 2016 one important observation made in this study was that the resistant e coli decreased throughout ozonation whereas the reduction of the abundance of the selected genes observed after treatment was apparently transient the reactivation of the respective bacterial hosts may explain that in the samples treated with 0 25 go3 gdoc 1 and an hrt of 10 min the examined genes were detected after 72 h at almost the same levels as the initial values 1 log cycle below the initial under dark and ambient temperature 22 25 c fig 5 additionally from fig 6 which presents the relative abundance of the examined genes it can be observed that despite the detected reduction of the abundance of the examined args and integrase genes after the treatment an increase in the prevalence of these genetic determinants was detected 72 h after the treatment these observations were expected and are in accordance with the results presented in section 3 2 where no total inactivation of the examined bacteria was obtained for the same samples having in mind that the 16s rrna gene is a biomarker of the load of total bacteria its increase in the treated samples under all operating conditions tested implies that other bacterial groups thriving in wastewater e g aeromonads pseudomonads surviving ozonation have contributed to the increase of the abundance of the examined genes a recovery on the examined genes was also observed for the more severe experimental conditions of hrt and ozone dose these results could be explained through the assumption made by alexander et al 2016 who suggested that bacteria may develop different levels of robustness or resistance against oxidative stress additionally the high organic content of the wastewater table s2 may react with the majority of the produced oxidizing species resulting in a very small fraction able to cause lethal damages to the live cells existing in the medium alexander et al 2016 investigated the efficiency of ozonation treatment to inactivate selected args in a pilot scale system 18 2 min of hrt and ozone dose up to 0 9 0 1 go3 gdoc 1 and the obtained results showed variations of the examined genes removed through ozonation with args of vana bla vim ampc and ermb being reduced by 49 9 18 7 69 8 and 99 3 respectively zhuang et al 2015 reported a slight removal of the examined genes at low ozone doses using a bench scale system with ozone dose varying between 27 and 128 mg l 1 a fact that may be attributed to the rapid consumption of ozone by the organic matter present in wastewater e g cod 13 29 mgo2 l 1 also the inactivation of the selected genes observed by zhuang et al 2015 was found to be enhanced by increasing ozone doses and this is in line with the results presented in this study continuous mode ozonation experiments performed in synthetic and real wastewater samples with constant ozone dose for different contact times e g 15 30 and 60 min indicated that increasing contact time led to the inactivation of the selected genes e g 16s rrna gene inti1 bla tem qnrs and sul1 up to 99 in relation to the initial load before treatment after 30 min of exposure sousa et al 2017 in addition sousa et al 2017 showed that the regrowth after 72 h of incubation occurred for samples treated for 15 and 30 min whereas no reactivation was observed after 60 min suggesting that this period of contact time was adequate to kill the majority of the cells however in the real wastewater samples which are characterized by higher microbial diversity and chemical complexity compared to synthetic wastewater the inactivation efficiency and the regrowth potential in the examined samples were lower and more intense respectively this may be ascribed to the fact that the structural organization of the bacterial cells is different with real wastewater containing a high number of aggregated cells forming flocs of different dimensions it is already known that the suspended solids the defom and the complexity of the microbiota in the wastewater may be the major factors explaining the variations of the efficiency of ozonation treatment zhuang et al 2015 sousa et al 2017 the fluctuation of the wastewater qualitative characteristics can influence the reaction mechanism of ozone affecting thus the overall disinfection efficiency towards the living cells in uwtps although not covered in this study according to pak et al 2016 damage of the surface of the cells by ozonation may lead to the release of dna if relatively intact args containing free fragments may be transferred to other microorganisms through horizontal mechanisms and contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance all those factors seemed to have influence on the ozonation efficiency and more detailed studies are needed to identify the proper conditions required to achieve the optimum performance of the ozonation treatment in terms of genes and args inactivation 3 4 mineralization and phytotoxicity assessment fig 7 a shows the results for the mineralization observed in the treated effluents in terms of doc removal it must be pointed out that the contribution of the antibiotics to the doc of the spiked wastewater effluent was negligible since the doc of the samples varied between 18 2 and 21 2 mg l 1 table s2 whereas the theoretical doc corresponding to the 8 spiked antibiotics was 0 45 mg l 1 3 a significant improvement was observed when increasing both the ozone dose and hrt specifically when applying an ozone dose of 0 25 go3 gdoc 1 and hrt of 10 min doc removal was found to be 10 12 whereas an ozone dose of 0 75 go3 gdoc 1 and hrt of 60 min led to doc removal up to 25 several studies are in line with the results presented herein and many of them attributed the low yield of mineralization to the formation of recalcitrant organic intermediates deriving from the oxidation of defom originally present in wastewater von sonntag and von gunten 2012 margot et al 2013 prieto rodrÃ­guez et al 2013 rodrÃ­guez chueca et al 2015 marce et al 2016 michael kordatou et al 2017 in a pilot scale study dealing with ozonation of secondary treated effluents liu et al 2014 reported a doc removal up to 28 after 30 min of contact time using an ozone concentration of 4 mg l 1 carbajo et al 2015 observed 35 of doc removal even using 130 mg l 1 of ozone and a contact time of 20 min no remarkable differences were found for doc removal by adding h2o2 fig 7b and this is in accordance to the results observed for the antibiotics in section 3 1 suggesting that h2o2 did not improve the removal of the oxidation products formed during ozonation in this work it was clearly shown that the degradation of the parent antibiotic compounds down to their limit of detection required mild ozone doses while under these conditions the reduction of the organic matter in terms of cod and doc was low 15 25 defom contains a variety of organic compounds that during their reaction with ozone and hydroxyl radicals may lead to the formation of persistent oxidation products these products may be not susceptible to ozone and can be even more toxic than the initial compounds phytotoxicity tests using three plants species lepidium sativum sinapis alba and sorghum saccharatum were considered suitable to evaluate the toxicity of the treated wastewater before its use for agriculture irrigation rizzo 2011 to evaluate the phytotoxicity of the treated samples and assess the influence of the ozone dose and hrt three experimental conditions reported in section 3 3 were selected the phytotoxicity of the treated samples towards l sativum s alba and s saccharatum was expressed as percentage of inhibition in the seed germination gi shoot germination si and root growth ri the experiments were conducted using wastewater effluent samples as collected fig 8 a and b and the same samples spiked with the target antibiotics fig 8c and d in order to elucidate the role of the oxidation products formed during ozonation in the phytotoxicity against the three plants species the raw wastewater samples did not cause any gi whereas an inhibition effect was observed in the ozonated samples with s saccharatum being the only seed showing a gi in the three sets of experiments fig s5 the main finding of the phytotoxicity assessment fig 8 was that the higher ozone doses or contact times increased the phytotoxicity levels of the treated samples the inhibition expressed as si and ri percentages in the spiked experiments were higher than those observed in the non spiked experiments according to fig 8 the highest si and ri were observed in the experiment applying ozone dose of 0 75 go3 gdoc 1 with hrt of 40 min these results are in agreement with those obtained by michael kordatou et al 2017 showing that ozonation resulted in the augmentation of the phytotoxicity i e root and shoot inhibition even after 15 min of treatment indicating that defom oxidation products were potentially more toxic than the original matrix this behaviour might be due to direct oxidation of various organic constituents present in the defom of the wastewater samples or to their oxidation via a hydroxyl radical mediated mechanism the high values of doc and cod of secondary treated effluent used for the implementation of the experiments are an indication of the existence of those organic constituents it is well known that a number of oxidation products can be formed during ozonation from the oxidation of both the examined antibiotics and the defom present in the secondary treated wastewater effluents von sonntag and von gunten 2012 lee and von gunten 2016 michael kordatou et al 2017 in fact the low doc removal could be correlated with the existence of ozonation products in the treated samples which could contribute to the increased phytotoxicity of the samples also results obtained from other studies using a variety of toxicological tests indicated that ozonation may cause other biological effects e g toxicity and genotoxicity stalter et al 2010 the above findings clearly indicate that the ozonation treatment is insufficient to completely mineralize the wastewater and poses risks of producing oxidation products with potentially phytotoxic effects in particular when the most severe operating conditions are tested considering that nowadays ozonation finds an increasing application in full scale uwtps more research should be performed on this issue in order to identify the specific oxidation products that may be responsible for the observed phytotoxic effects 4 conclusions the findings of this study demonstrated that ozonation of wastewater operated at continuous mode constitutes a promising treatment technology for the elimination of the selected a arb args the results revealed that low ozone doses accompanied by prolonged treatment time was needed to eliminate the parent compounds of the examined antibiotics to concentration below their lod in the spiked experiments whereas the mildest conditions i e lower hrt of 10 min for the same ozone dose of 0 125 go3 gdoc 1 were sufficient to degrade the parent compounds in the non spiked experiments no substantial mineralization was observed at the end of the treatment time at all experimental conditions examined a fact that may explain the enhanced phytotoxicity of the ozonated samples towards the tested plant species ozonation operated at high hrt and ozone doses hrt 40 min 0 25 go3 gdoc 1 was capable of inactivating total as well as tmp or smx resistant e coli with the simultaneous reduction of the abundance of the examined genes however regrowth cannot be avoided after ozonation as it was demonstrated that living cells might still exist in the treated samples even after prolonged treatment overall it was shown that ozonation upon its proper optimisation constitutes an efficient treatment option for the removal of antibiotic related microcontaminants from wastewater effluents nevertheless it is suggested that after ozonation post treatment by biological filtration or activated carbon adsorption may overcome the main limitations of this process in relation to phytotoxicity also more studies are needed to establish conditions capable of limiting regrowth of arb after ozonation these efforts will contribute to improving the quality of the treated wastewater while minimising the potential risks of spread of antibiotic resistance in the receiving environment acknowledgments this paper is part of a project that has received funding from the european union s

18788,the use of pot ceramic filters pcf to improve the domestic water quality supply has been recognized as an alternative in regions where there is unsecure water treatment or contamination of the treated water during transport and storage and an absence of safe drinking water the aim of this study was to evaluate a model of pcf impregnated with colloidal silver under three filtration rates 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 l h and three e coli and salmonella spp concentrations 104 103 and 102 cfu ml the evaluation was made using spiked water having a turbidity of 29 9 4 4 ntu and conductivity of 176 31 7 Î¼s

spp there were not found significant statistical differences between the filtration rates and the removal efficiencies for turbidity e coli and salmonella spp it was observed that the microbiological removal efficiency was affected by biofilm formation a phenomenon that was attributed to the presence of salmonella spp the combination of chemical and mechanical cleaning methods contributed to the elimination of the biofilm keywords biofilm drinking water household treatment household filters safe water turbidity 1 introduction the millennium development goals mdgs produced important changes in the political will to reduce extreme poverty and to improve access to water sanitation and health for 2 600 million people despite this improvement it is estimated that water scarcity affects more than 40 of people around the world a situation that is likely to worsen due to climate change consequently water quality and supply remain a worldwide challenge it is believed that 1 8 billion people globally use drinking water sources that are fecal contaminated who 2015 undp 2018 unsafe water supply inadequate sanitation and insufficient hygiene are the main causes of diarrheic illness responsible for the death of 1 5 million people each year who 2015 rotaviruses leading the cause of diarrhea associated deaths followed by shigella spp y salmonella spp gbd 2017 between 11 and 21

the most recognized household methods are chlorination solar disinfection filtration combined coagulation disinfection systems boiling and safe storage filtration using candle or pot ceramic filters with small pores often coated with silver to control bacterial growth has been shown to be effective at removing many microbes some chemicals and suspended solids who 2007 bielefeldt et al 2009 mwabi et al 2011 pÃ©rez vidal et al 2016 karim et al 2016 van halem et al 2017 gupta et al 2018 the filtration rate is considered the main quality control parameter in the fabrication of pot ceramic filters pcf because it influences the microbiological quality of the treated water salvinelli et al 2016 van halem et al 2017 the aim of this study was to evaluated the efficiency of a pcf made in colombia to remove e coli and salmonella spp under three different filtration rates this type of filter is currently used in colombia by some rural communities that have problems with water quality particularly in regions such as chocÃ³ valle del cauca cauca cÃ³rdoba antioquia and caquetÃ¡ replacol 2018 the selection of salmonella spp in this study was based on the recognized relation with waterborne outbreaks in developing countries its capacity to produce biofilm wingender and flemming 2011 levantesi et al 2012 and the limited research reported in the literature mwabi et al 2011 the e coli was chosen because it is the most commonly used fecal indicator globally who 2017 rÃ­os tobÃ³n et al 2017 furthermore it has been used in previous studies as a parameter to evaluate the microbiological efficiency of ceramic pot filters lantagne 2001 bielefeldt et al 2009 mwabi et al 2011 2 material and methods the research was carried out in the universidad santiago de cali colombia the filters were new and their evaluation was made in duplicate at an average environmental temperature of 21 c over 4 months fig 1 shows the experimental set up the filter pot is made of red clay impregnated with colloidal silver in a 500 ppm concentration the pot is located inside a plastic bucket because the porosity of the ceramic pot can widely change due to the firing process the manufacturer has established the filtration rate as the main quality parameter it can vary between 1 l h and 3 l h filters with lower or higher values are not sold based on the above an unifactorial experiment differentiated by the type of bacteria e coli and salmonella spp was designed the bacteria concentration varied between 104 103 and 102 cfu ml under filtration rates of 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 l h filter 1 filter 2 and filter 3 respectively the methodology was carried out in three steps i preparation of spiked water ii operation and evaluation of the systems and iii statistical analysis 2 1 preparation of spiked water the spiked water was prepared using tap water adding sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate na2s2o3 5h2o in a 20 mg l concentration to reduce the free residual chlorine the chlorine absence was verified with a color disc test kit hach cn 70f the spiking of the tap water was made with kaolin 0 12 g l to obtain a value near to 30 nephelometric turbidity unit ntu analytical grade nacl merck 0 12 g l was added to obtain a concentration of 100 mg l of total dissolved solids tds to avoid the early lysis of bacteria cells epa 1987 pÃ©rez vidal et al 2016 sanabria et al 2011 the addition of e coli and salmonella spp was made as described below 2 1 1 e coli and salmonella spp preparation the salmonella spp atcc 14028 and e coli atcc 25922 strains were obtained from the american type culture collection rockville md t their purity was verified with crystal biochemical tests for enterobacteriacea non fermenters of bbl bd a bacterial growth calibration graph according to the mcfarland scale between 0 5 and 10 at 620 nm wavelength was made thermospectronic genesys 20 the preparation of the inoculum was started by reactivating the strains transferring 20 Î¼l to 150 ml of nutrient broth merck 105443 followed by an incubation period between 18 and 24 hours and 35 c 2 to obtain the bacteria growth stationary phase finally the cell washing procedure and the initial bacteria adjustment were carried out following the methodology of rivera et al 2010 2 2 operation and performance of the filtration systems the filtration systems were operated in batch mode during 135 days changing the microbiological quality of the spiked water every 5 weeks the operation of the systems started with e coli and salmonella spp concentration of 104 cfu ml phase 1 later it was reduced to 103 cfu ml phase 2 and finally to 102 cfu ml phase 3 the progressive periodic reduction of the bacteria concentration was made to reach an average microbiological removal efficiency the daily volume of prepared spiked water was 50 l of which 7 5 l was added to each filtration system the total filtrated water during the operation time was 1013 l per filter the sampling of the filtrated water was made 3 hours after the filter was filled the evaluation of the systems was carried out evaluating the variables described in table 1 for the spiked water as well as for the filtered water turbidity was measured using a portable meter hach 2100n ph was measured with a mettler toledo ph meter f20 fiveeasy and conductivity with a portable vwrs conductivity meter 2052 model additionally the tap water microbiological quality was periodically verified in terms of the heterotrophic bacteria pseudomonas total coliforms e coli and salmonella spp using the standard methods apha 2012 the conductivity was used as an indirect parameter of the tds concentration spellman 2013 for that purpose a correlation curve between the two variables to correlate an average value of 200 Î¼s cm with tds of 100 mg l was made the filtration rate was determined by measuring the filtered volume over time recordings were made at 1 3 and 5 hours after the filling of the filters in order to obtain an average along a filtration run mwabi et al 2011 the ceramic pot and the plastic parts of the filtration systems were cleaned daily with tap water when the filtration rate decreased usually every 20 days the ceramic pot was cleaned using a soft brush in the middle of the phase 1 the microbiological efficiency decreased this was solved by intensifying the cleaning of the plastic container and its accessories using a sponge and water with a sodium hypochlorite concentration of 4 the chlorine content after cleaning was reduced by washing the filters with sufficient tap water 2 3 statistical analysis the results were analyzed using descriptive statistical tools with median and interquartile range the removal efficiencies of the systems were evaluated using the kruskal wallis test a non parametric alternative to the anova test with the r project free software 3 results and discussions 3 1 spiked water the evaluation of the tap water quality during the experiment showed an average residual chlorine between 0 5 and 1 5 mg l and there was no presence of pseudomonas e coli and salmonella spp only one evaluation showed 4 cfu 100 ml of total coliforms and 9 cfu 100 ml of heterotrophic plate count hpc table 2 and table 3 show the physicochemical and microbiological water quality of the spiked water during the study as can be seen in table 2 the measured variables follow a normal probability distribution this is not the case for microbiological parameters therefore they are presented in interquartile ranges see table 3 the physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of the spiked water were similar to those suggested by epa 1987 with maximum critical values of turbidity 30 ntu and 104 cfu ml according to salvinelli et al 2016 a level up to 30 ntu is the turbidity of source waters typically treated by cpf higher values of 50 ntu require previous treatment cawst 2018 however some authors have evaluated cpf with a turbidity of 40 ntu bielefeldt et al 2010 62 ntu lantagne 2001 and 89 ntu mwabi et al 2011 the evaluation of the surplus spiked water was consistently made at the same time after 2 hours of filtration taking into account that bacteria replication time is 30 minutes madigan et al 2015 e coli regrowth was not observed during the study by contrast the salmonella spp showed regrowth between 1 and 2 log units this condition could affect the removal efficiencies of the filters with small filtration rates because a higher retention time in the ceramic pot can promote the bacterial regrowth in the spiked water 3 2 performance of the filtration systems 3 2 1 physicochemical variables and filtration rate because the physicochemical effluent variables evaluated in this study do not follow a normal probability distribution the comparison analysis between the filtration systems was done using the median and the kruskal wallis non parametric test table 4 shows the summary of the characteristics of the filtration systems for the physicochemical variables and the filtration rate measured during the operation of the systems the filters were washed daily with tap water weekly with chlorinated water and brushed 6 times every 20 days a small increment of the ph of the filtered water compared with the spiked water was observed this could be caused by the alkalinity present in the clay of the ceramic pot the increment was not significant compared to other similar filtration systems pÃ©rez vidal et al 2016 the conductivity in the filtered water was between 2 and 6 of the spiked water indicating indirectly that the systems are not efficient for the dissolved solids removal the average conductivity value for the three evaluated filtration rates were similar and no statistical difference was found df 2 x2 0 38 p 0 82 regarding the turbidity the filtration systems showed average efficiencies of 97 constantly reaching values under the limit of colombian regulations 2 0 ntu and average values less than 1 0 ntu as recommended by who 2017 according to who 2017 turbidity values higher than 4 0 ntu reduce the acceptability of the drinking water and also may indicate the presence of microbial contaminants and stimulate the growth of bacteria therefore it is recommended that the turbidity of water supply is less than 1 0 ntu monis et al 2017 in this case the evaluated pcfs had average turbidity values less than 1 0 ntu a value that is less than the results of similar studies with averages values of 3 2 ntu lantagne 2001 and 5 3 ntu mwabi et al 2011 fig 2 a and b are box and whisker plots showing the variation of the turbidity during the study for the three filtration rates the high turbidity removal during the study observed in fig 2a and b illustrate that for 75 of the time the turbidity value was less than 1 2 ntu the boxplot analysis see fig 2b shows that the results are similar for the evaluated systems this was confirmed with the statistical analysis performed with the kruskal wallis test that showed no significant statistical differences between the three filtration rates and their turbidity removal df 2 x2 0 058 p 0 97 fig 3 shows the distribution of the filtration rate data during the study the filter 2 operated most of the time in the filtration rate indicated by the manufacturer median 1 9 l h the filter 1 operated at higher values median 1 5 l h and the filter 3 operated at lower values median 2 1 l h the non parametric kruskal wallis anova test showed significant statistical differences between the three systems df 2 x2 17 7 p 0 00 a post anova conover test showed that the significant statistical differences were between the pair systems 1 and 2 and between 1 and 3 p value 0 0001 for both comparisons there were no significant statistical differences between the pair 2 and 3 during the first scrubbing events an increment of the systems filtration rate was observed filter 1 2 l h filter 2 3 1 l h and filter 3 3 2 l h however after day 80 the filtration rate decreased despite the cleaning of the systems filter 1 0 8 l h filter 2 1 0 l h filter 3 1 0 l h this increment of the total filter resistance can be attributed to irreversible blockage of pores rp as reported by van halem et al 2017 some studies have shown that the filtration rate is a key parameter used by the manufacturers of these systems to indirectly establish their efficiency salvinelli et al 2016 van halem et al 2017 this study found big differences between the filtration rate values reported by the manufacturers and the experimental measurements further research will be required in order to evaluate the rp values in long term studies with larger water volume and the influence of local environmental temperature on the filtration rate gupta et al 2018 3 2 2 microbiological variables table 5 shows the e coli and salmonella spp concentrations of the filtered water during the study the microbiological efficiency was between 90 and 99 9 obtaining an average removal of 2 lrv for e coli and 1 lrv for salmonella spp during the first phase of the study the performance of the filtration systems was better despite having been fed with a larger microbial load 4 logarithmic units the removal efficiency for e coli was higher compared to salmonella spp and there were no statistical differences between the filtration rates and the e coli and salmonella spp removal p value 0 05 these results are similar to other studies for e coli removal karim et al 2016 gupta et al 2018 and lower for salmonella removal mwabi et al 2011 the microbiological removal efficiencies reached values up to 4 lrv 99 99 however the systems performance was highly variable and strongly influenced by the cleaning activities this can be attributed to the presence of biofilm because the efficiency recovered once the cleaning process of the plastic bucket was improved through the use of a sponge and chlorinated water previous studies have shown the capacity of salmonella spp to promote biofilm formation levantesi

chloride oxidized these compounds producing the yellow pigmentation despite there were no significant statistical differences between the filtration rate and the microbiological efficiency of the systems the results of this study showed that the use of filter 2 allows a balance between the amount of produced water and the removal efficiency of the evaluated physicochemical and bacteriological parameters lower filtration rates can cause bacterial growth in the water stored in the pot because bacteria can replicate in short periods 20 30 minutes madigan et al 2015 higher filtration rates can reduce the microbiological removal efficiency because of the higher porosity of the ceramic pot although biofilms can be eliminated by adopting mechanical physical or chemical methods satpathy et al 2016 biofilms can be tolerant to detergent removal and disinfectant action johani et al 2018 therefore it is recommended to evaluate both the cleaning intervals and disinfection or a combination of

controlling biofilm formation or eradicate mature biofilm satpathy et al 2016 previous studies have shown that the production of safe water in pcf depends of three barriers 1 the pore structure that must be the primary mechanism of water treatment lyon marion et al 2018 2 the bactericide effect of the colloidal silver during filtration bielefeldt et al 2009 and 3 the residence time of water in the plastic bucket van halem et al 2017 however it should be noted that the efficiency of these barriers would be strongly related to factors such as cleaning frequency and the cleaning method which when not undertaken properly can produce biofilm in the filters further research of these factors is recommended 4 conclusions the characteristics of the spiked water were turbidity 29 9 4 4 ntu tds

were no significant statistical differences between the filtration rates measured in filters 2 0 2l h and 3 0 3l h from the operation day 80 it was observed a progressive decline in the filtration rate despite the cleaning with a brush it was attributed to the irreversible process of blocking pores for the three evaluated filtration rates 1 2 y 3 l h there were no significant statistical differences for turbidity e coli and salmonella spp removal however it is recommended the operation of pcf with a filtration rate of 2 l h because it produces a balance between the amount of produced water and its quality the removal efficiencies of the filtration systems were negatively affected by the biofilm formation located between the pore ceramic pot and the plastic bucket walls the combined use of chemical chlorinated water and mechanical dish sponge methods were successful for the removal of the biofilm therefore it is recommendable to evaluate the frequency and the cleaning

18788,the use of pot ceramic filters pcf to improve the domestic water quality supply has been recognized as an alternative in regions where there is unsecure water treatment or contamination of the treated water during transport and storage and an absence of safe drinking water the aim of this study was to evaluate a model of pcf impregnated with colloidal silver under three filtration rates 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 l h and three e coli and salmonella spp concentrations 104 103 and 102 cfu ml the evaluation was made using spiked water having a turbidity of 29 9 4 4 ntu and conductivity of 176 31 7 Î¼s

spp there were not found significant statistical differences between the filtration rates and the removal efficiencies for turbidity e coli and salmonella spp it was observed that the microbiological removal efficiency was affected by biofilm formation a phenomenon that was attributed to the presence of salmonella spp the combination of chemical and mechanical cleaning methods contributed to the elimination of the biofilm keywords biofilm drinking water household treatment household filters safe water turbidity 1 introduction the millennium development goals mdgs produced important changes in the political will to reduce extreme poverty and to improve access to water sanitation and health for 2 600 million people despite this improvement it is estimated that water scarcity affects more than 40 of people around the world a situation that is likely to worsen due to climate change consequently water quality and supply remain a worldwide challenge it is believed that 1 8 billion people globally use drinking water sources that are fecal contaminated who 2015 undp 2018 unsafe water supply inadequate sanitation and insufficient hygiene are the main causes of diarrheic illness responsible for the death of 1 5 million people each year who 2015 rotaviruses leading the cause of diarrhea associated deaths followed by shigella spp y salmonella spp gbd 2017 between 11 and 21 million cases and 128000 to 161000 typhoid related deaths occur annually worldwide who 2018 in colombia salmonella has been one of the main aetiology of diarrhoeal under 5 deaths gbd 2017 in developed countries salmonella has rarely been reported in water borne outbreaks however it has frequently been detected in surface waters having been reported in 2015 as the fourth etiological agent causing under 5 deaths levantesi et al 2012 gbd 2017 detected salmonella outbreaks particularly caused by s typhimurium are mostly linked to contaminated drinking waters or the use of untreated water which implies that salmonella is still a significant health risk in developing countries where it is common to find limitations in water supply sanitation and health care levantesi et al 2012 who 2017 94 of the diarrheic cases could be avoid with preventive interventions aimed at improved the access to drinking water sanitation and health and by 39 via household water treatment and safe storage who 2007 the most recognized household methods are chlorination solar disinfection filtration combined coagulation disinfection systems boiling and safe storage filtration using candle or pot ceramic filters with small pores often coated with silver to control bacterial growth has been shown to be effective at removing many microbes some chemicals and suspended solids who 2007 bielefeldt et al 2009 mwabi et al 2011 pÃ©rez vidal et al 2016 karim et al 2016 van halem et al 2017 gupta et al 2018 the filtration rate is considered the main quality control parameter in the fabrication of pot ceramic filters pcf because it influences the microbiological quality of the treated water salvinelli et al 2016 van halem et al 2017 the aim of this study was to evaluated the efficiency of a pcf made in colombia to remove e coli and salmonella spp under three different filtration rates this type of filter is currently used in colombia by some rural communities that have problems with water quality particularly in regions such as chocÃ³ valle del cauca cauca cÃ³rdoba antioquia and caquetÃ¡ replacol 2018 the selection of salmonella spp in this study was based on the recognized relation with waterborne outbreaks in developing countries its capacity to produce biofilm wingender and flemming 2011 levantesi et al 2012 and the limited research reported in the literature mwabi et al 2011 the e coli was chosen because it is the most commonly used fecal indicator globally who 2017 rÃ­os tobÃ³n et al 2017 furthermore it has been used in previous studies as a parameter to evaluate the microbiological efficiency of ceramic pot filters lantagne 2001 bielefeldt et al 2009 mwabi et al 2011 2 material and methods the research was carried out in the universidad santiago de cali colombia the filters were new and their evaluation was made in duplicate at an average environmental temperature of 21 c over 4 months fig 1 shows the experimental set up the filter pot is made of red clay impregnated with colloidal silver in a 500 ppm concentration the pot is located inside a plastic bucket because the porosity of the ceramic pot can widely change due to the firing process the manufacturer has established the filtration rate as the main quality parameter it can vary between 1 l h and 3 l h filters with lower or higher values are not sold based on the above an unifactorial experiment differentiated by the type of bacteria e coli and salmonella spp was designed the bacteria concentration varied between 104 103 and 102 cfu ml under filtration rates of 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 l h filter 1 filter 2 and filter 3 respectively the methodology was carried out in three steps i preparation of spiked water ii operation and evaluation of the systems and iii statistical analysis 2 1 preparation of spiked water the spiked water was prepared using tap water adding sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate na2s2o3 5h2o in a 20 mg l concentration to reduce the free residual chlorine the chlorine absence was verified with a color disc test kit hach cn 70f the spiking of the tap water was made with kaolin 0 12 g l to obtain a value near to 30 nephelometric turbidity unit ntu analytical grade nacl merck 0 12 g l was added to obtain a concentration of 100 mg l of total dissolved solids tds to avoid the early lysis of bacteria cells epa 1987 pÃ©rez vidal et al 2016 sanabria et al 2011 the addition of e coli and salmonella spp was made as described below 2 1 1 e coli and salmonella spp preparation the salmonella spp atcc 14028 and e coli atcc 25922 strains were obtained from the american type culture collection rockville md t their purity was verified with crystal biochemical tests for enterobacteriacea non fermenters of bbl bd a bacterial growth calibration graph according to the mcfarland scale between 0 5 and 10 at 620 nm wavelength was made thermospectronic genesys 20 the preparation of the inoculum was started by reactivating the strains transferring 20 Î¼l to 150 ml of nutrient broth merck 105443 followed by an incubation period between 18 and 24 hours and 35 c 2 to obtain the bacteria growth stationary phase finally the cell washing procedure and the initial bacteria adjustment were carried out following the methodology of rivera et al 2010 2 2 operation and performance of the filtration systems the filtration systems were operated in batch mode during 135 days changing the microbiological quality of the spiked water every 5 weeks the operation of the systems started with e coli and salmonella spp concentration of 104 cfu ml phase 1 later it was reduced to 103 cfu ml phase 2 and finally to 102 cfu ml phase 3 the progressive periodic reduction of the bacteria concentration was made to reach an average microbiological removal efficiency the daily volume of prepared spiked water was 50 l of which 7 5 l was added to each filtration system the total filtrated water during the operation time was 1013 l per filter the sampling of the filtrated water was made 3 hours after the filter was filled the evaluation of the systems was carried out evaluating the variables described in table 1 for the spiked water as well as for the filtered water turbidity was measured using a portable meter hach 2100n ph was measured with a mettler toledo ph meter f20 fiveeasy and conductivity with a portable vwrs conductivity meter 2052 model additionally the tap water microbiological quality was periodically verified in terms of the heterotrophic bacteria pseudomonas total coliforms e coli and salmonella spp using the standard methods apha 2012 the conductivity was used as an indirect parameter of the tds concentration spellman 2013 for that purpose a correlation curve between the two variables to correlate an average value of 200 Î¼s cm with tds of 100 mg l was made the filtration rate was determined by measuring the filtered volume over time recordings were made at 1 3 and 5 hours after the filling of the filters in order to obtain an average along a filtration run mwabi et al 2011 the ceramic pot and the plastic parts of the filtration systems were cleaned daily with tap water when the filtration rate decreased usually every 20 days the ceramic pot was cleaned using a soft brush in the middle of the phase 1 the microbiological efficiency decreased this was solved by intensifying the cleaning of the plastic container and its accessories using a sponge and water with a sodium hypochlorite concentration of 4 the chlorine content after cleaning was reduced by washing the filters with sufficient tap water 2 3 statistical analysis the results were analyzed using descriptive statistical tools with median and interquartile range the removal efficiencies of the systems were evaluated using the kruskal wallis test a non parametric alternative to the anova test with the r project free software 3 results and discussions 3 1 spiked water the evaluation of the tap water quality during the experiment showed an average residual chlorine between 0 5 and 1 5 mg l and there was no presence of pseudomonas e coli and salmonella spp only one evaluation showed 4 cfu 100 ml of total coliforms and 9 cfu 100 ml of heterotrophic plate count hpc table 2 and table 3 show the physicochemical and microbiological water quality of the spiked water during the study as can be seen in table 2 the measured variables follow a normal probability distribution this is not the case for microbiological parameters therefore they are presented in interquartile ranges see table 3 the physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of the spiked water were similar to those suggested by epa 1987 with maximum critical values of turbidity 30 ntu and 104 cfu ml according to salvinelli et al 2016 a level up to 30 ntu is the turbidity of source waters typically treated by cpf higher values of 50 ntu require previous treatment cawst 2018 however some authors have evaluated cpf with a turbidity of 40 ntu bielefeldt et al 2010 62 ntu lantagne 2001 and 89 ntu mwabi et al 2011 the evaluation of the surplus spiked water was consistently made at the same time after 2 hours of filtration taking into account that bacteria replication time is 30 minutes madigan et al 2015 e coli regrowth was not observed during the study by contrast the salmonella spp showed regrowth between 1 and 2 log units this condition could affect the removal efficiencies of the filters with small filtration rates because a higher retention time in the ceramic pot can promote the bacterial regrowth in the spiked water 3 2 performance of the filtration systems 3 2 1 physicochemical variables and filtration rate because the physicochemical effluent variables evaluated in this study do not follow a normal probability distribution the comparison analysis between the filtration systems was done using the median and the kruskal wallis non parametric test table 4 shows the summary of the characteristics of the filtration systems for the physicochemical variables and the filtration rate measured during the operation of the systems the filters were washed daily with tap water weekly with chlorinated water and brushed 6 times every 20 days a small increment of the ph of the filtered water compared with the spiked water was observed this could be caused by the alkalinity present in the clay of the ceramic pot the increment was not significant compared to other similar filtration systems pÃ©rez vidal et al 2016 the conductivity in the filtered water was between 2 and 6 of the spiked water indicating indirectly that the systems are not efficient for the dissolved solids removal the average conductivity value for the three evaluated filtration rates were similar and no statistical difference was found df 2 x2 0 38 p 0 82 regarding the turbidity the filtration systems showed average efficiencies of 97 constantly reaching values under the limit of colombian regulations 2 0 ntu and average values less than 1 0 ntu as recommended by who 2017 according to who 2017 turbidity values higher than 4 0 ntu reduce the acceptability of the drinking water and also may indicate the presence of microbial contaminants and stimulate the growth of bacteria therefore it is recommended that the turbidity of water supply is less than 1 0 ntu monis et al 2017 in this case the evaluated pcfs had average turbidity values less than 1 0 ntu a value that is less than the results of similar studies with averages values of 3 2 ntu lantagne 2001 and 5 3 ntu mwabi et al 2011 fig 2 a and b are box and whisker plots showing the variation of the turbidity during the study for the three filtration rates the high turbidity removal during the study observed in fig 2a and b illustrate that for 75 of the time the turbidity value was less than 1 2 ntu the boxplot analysis see fig 2b shows that the results are similar for the evaluated systems this was confirmed with the statistical analysis performed with the kruskal wallis test that showed no significant statistical differences between the three filtration rates and their turbidity removal df 2 x2 0 058 p 0 97 fig 3 shows the distribution of the filtration rate data during the study the filter 2 operated most of the time in the filtration rate indicated by the manufacturer median 1 9 l h the filter 1 operated at higher values median 1 5 l h and the filter 3 operated at lower values median 2 1 l h the non parametric kruskal wallis anova test showed significant statistical differences between the three systems df 2 x2 17 7 p 0 00 a post anova conover test showed that the significant statistical differences were between the pair systems 1 and 2 and between 1 and 3 p value 0 0001 for both comparisons there were no significant statistical differences between the pair 2 and 3 during the first scrubbing events an increment of the systems filtration rate was observed filter 1 2 l h filter 2 3 1 l h and filter 3 3 2 l h however after day 80 the filtration rate decreased despite the cleaning of the systems filter 1 0 8 l h filter 2 1 0 l h filter 3 1 0 l h this increment of the total filter resistance can be attributed to irreversible blockage of pores rp as reported by van halem et al 2017 some studies have shown that the filtration rate is a key parameter used by the manufacturers of these systems to indirectly establish their efficiency salvinelli et al 2016 van halem et al 2017 this study found big differences between the filtration rate values reported by the manufacturers and the experimental measurements further research will be required in order to evaluate the rp values in long term studies with larger water volume and the influence of local environmental temperature on the filtration rate gupta et al 2018 3 2 2 microbiological variables table 5 shows the e coli and salmonella spp concentrations of the filtered water during the study the microbiological efficiency was between 90 and 99 9 obtaining an average removal of 2 lrv for e coli and 1 lrv for salmonella spp during the first phase of the study the performance of the filtration systems was better despite having been fed with a larger microbial load 4 logarithmic units the removal efficiency for e coli was higher compared to salmonella spp and there were no statistical differences between the filtration rates and the e coli and salmonella spp removal p value 0 05 these results are similar to other studies for e coli removal karim et al 2016 gupta et al 2018 and lower for salmonella removal mwabi et al 2011 the microbiological removal efficiencies reached values up to 4 lrv 99 99 however the systems performance was highly variable and strongly influenced by the cleaning activities this can be attributed to the presence of biofilm because the efficiency recovered once the cleaning process of the plastic bucket was improved through the use of a sponge and chlorinated water previous studies have shown the capacity of salmonella spp to promote biofilm formation levantesi et al 2012 yang et al 2017 besides it is widely accepted that all relevant water related pathogenic bacterial species have a tendency to adhere to solid surfaces and or to form monospecies biofilms

identified algal toxins and they may react with chlorine to undergo decomposition and generate disinfection byproducts dbps during pre chlorination as well as chlorine disinfection in this study the decomposition of bmaa and dab during chlorination and the consequent dbps formation were investigated the bmaa and dab concentrations in source waters were determined the decomposition kinetics of bmaa and dab and the formation of dbps during chlorination were studied the formation pathways of dbps from bmaa and dab were explored and the factors which may affect the decomposition and dbps formation were examined the results revealed that bmaa and dab were commonly detected in source waters from taihu lake and the highest level of bmaa reached 230 8 ng l while the concentrations of dab were generally around 2 0 ng l the decomposition of bmaa and dab during chlorination both followed pseudo first order decay while the decomposition rate constant of dab was significantly higher than that of bmaa trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas and haloacetonitriles hans were all generated during the chlorination of bmaa and dab with relatively high yields notably the thms haas and hans yields of each carbon atom from bmaa and dab were significantly higher than that from other organic precursors and the formation of hans from dab was significantly higher than that from bmaa the formation pathways of dbps from bmaa and dab were tentatively proposed and verified through theoretical calculations of note the proposed formation pathways of thms and haas from bmaa were similar to that from dab while the proposed formation pathways of hans from bmaa and dab showed some differences chlorine dose ph and temperature all affected the decomposition of bmaa and dab and dbps formation during chlorination graphical abstract image 1 keywords algal toxins bmaa dab chlorination decomposition dbps formation 1 introduction excessive nutrient loading results in eutrophication of surface waters which may further lead to cyanobacterial blue green algae blooms merel et al 2013 cyanobacteria are able to release harmful algal toxins which comprise more than 100 compounds with varying chemical structures and toxicological properties lawton et al 1994 merel et al 2013 due to the negative effects to human health briand et al 2003 griffiths and saker 2003 kuiper goodman et al 1999 pouria et al 1998 algal toxins have become a serious public concern recently algal toxins mainly include hepatotoxins acting on the liver neurotoxins acting on the nervous system and dermatotoxins causing skin irritation merel et al 2013 among them microcystins mcs a class of hepatotoxins are a main family of algal toxins which have been most frequently studied due to their wide occurrence fristachi and sinclair 2008 a guideline limit of 1 Î¼g l for mc lr one of the most common mcs has been proposed by the world health organization in drinking water who 1998 recently a neurotoxin Î² n methylamino l alanine bmaa has been newly identified in different countries all over the world brand et al 2010 esterhuizen and downing 2008 johnson et al 2008 li et al 2010 metcalf et al 2008 it has been reported that this algal toxin may be produced by all known categories of cyanobacteria cox et al 2005 and thus it may be widely present in surface waters with cyanobacteria however as a novel algal toxin bmaa has not been extensively studied yet bmaa is a non protein amino acid with a molecular weight of 118 da as shown in fig 1 a it mainly acts on motor neurons and could also lead to intraneuronal protein misfolding banack et al 2010 bmaa is assumed to be related to different neurodegenerative diseases banack et al 2010 murch et al 2004 pablo et al 2009 nevertheless owing to the lack of toxicological data no guideline for bmaa has been proposed in drinking water besides 2 4 diaminobutyric acid dab fig 1b an isomer of bmaa was also detected in cyanobacteria samples krÃ¼ger et al 2010 rosÃ©n and hellenÃ¤s 2008 dab is neurotoxic through inhibition of the absorption of the neurotransmitter g aminobutyric acid in neurons and glia cells iversen and kelly 1975 as two novel algal toxins bmaa and dab call for further investigation due to their ubiquity in source waters and diverse adverse effects pre oxidation is widely adopted to oxidize constituents in source waters to facilitate their removal during water treatment and especially it is widely applied for the pretreatment of algae containing source waters henderson et al 2008 hoko and makado 2011 plummer and edzwald 2002 pre chlorination is one of the most commonly used pre oxidation methods the algal toxins in source waters may undergo decomposition during pre chlorination acero et al 2005 and some disinfection byproducts dbps may also be generated from the algal toxins during this process chu et al 2017 besides the conventional water treatment system is capable of removing algal cells and the majority of intracellular algal toxins effectively but it poorly removes extracellular algal toxins which are released by cyanobacteria to water thus the remaining algal toxins in water may also further react with chlorine to form dbps during chlorine disinfection previous studies have reported the formation of various dbps including trihalomethanes thms haloaldehydes and haloacetonitriles hans from mc lr during chlorination chu et al 2017 however up to now few studies have reported the decomposition of the novel algal toxins bmaa and dab during water chlorination and the consequent dbps formation which may be a critical issue that should be concerned generally the organic dbps in disinfected waters can be categorized to carbonaceous dbps c dbps and nitrogenous dbps n dbps richardson et al 2007 thms and haloacetic acids haas are the two classes of c dbps regulated by u s epa and thus they have received the most public concern richardson et al 2007 dihalo and trihalo species of haas were the most commonly detected in disinfected waters richardson et al 2007 n dbps are generally more toxic than c dbps muellner et al 2007 richardson et al 2007 and thus they have attracted more and more attention hans are an important class of n dbps which were widely detected with relatively high concentrations in disinfected waters krasner et al 1989 richardson et al 2007 williams et al 1997 dihalo and trihalo species of hans were the most commonly detected richardson et al 2007 since algal toxins contain nitrogen the formation of n dbps from bmaa and dab should not be ignored thus the formation of the three important classes of c dbps and n dbps thms haas and hans from bmaa and dab during chlorination should be concerned thus the purposes of this study were to determine the concentrations of bmaa and dab in source waters to investigate the decomposition kinetics of bmaa and dab and the formation of thms haas and hans from bmaa and dab during chlorination to explore the formation pathways of thms haas and hans from bmaa and dab during chlorination and to examine the effects of different factors on the decomposition of bmaa and dab and the formation of dbps during chlorination 2

collected in october 2015 during a cyanobacterial bloom at 10 different locations from taihu lake the distribution of the sampling points is presented in fig s1 and table s1 in the supporting information si the collected source water samples were filtered with 0 45 Î¼m membrane and then stored at 4 c to minimize changes in constituents prior to pretreatment the samples were brought back to room temperature oasis mcx cartridges 500 mg 6 cc were used for preconcentration of bmaa and dab in the collected source water samples firstly the solid phase extraction spe cartridges were conditioned prior to use with 5 ml of methanol followed by 5 ml of ultrapure water then 1 l of a sample was loaded onto the cartridges at a flow rate of 20 ml min after adsorption elution with 5 ml of methanol containing 0 1 formic acid followed by 5 ml of methanol containing 5 nh3 h2o was performed finally the eluent was mixed and evaporated to 0 3 ml diluted with acetonitrile water v v 1 1 containing 0 1 formic acid to 1 ml spiked with simetone as the internal standard and then filtered with a 0 22 Î¼m membrane before hplc ms ms analysis triplicate samples were prepared 2 3 preparation of chlorinated samples to investigate the decomposition kinetics of bmaa or dab during chlorination a set of chlorinated bmaa or dab samples with different contact times were prepared fourteen aliquots 100 ml of a bmaa or dab solution 100 Î¼g l were prepared for aliquot 1 no naocl was dosed for aliquots 2 14 naocl was dosed at 5 mg l as cl2 in high excess compared with bmaa or dab and then the ph was adjusted to 7 with naoh and h2so4 solutions chlorination was conducted in headspace free amber glass bottles at 20 c the contact times of aliquots 2 14 were 2 min 5 min 10 min 20 min 30 min 50 min 1 5 h 3 h 6 h 12 h 24 h 36 h and 48 h respectively notably to better determine the decomposition kinetics of bmaa or dab during chlorination a relatively high concentration of bmaa or dab 100 Î¼g l and a relatively long reaction time range 0 48 h were adopted in this study to study the formation of dbps during chlorination another set of chlorinated bmaa or dab samples with different contact times were prepared fourteen aliquots 100 ml of a bmaa or dab solution 100 Î¼g l were prepared for aliquot 1 no naocl was dosed for aliquots 2 14 naocl was dosed at 120 Î¼g l as cl2 cl2 n molar ratio 1 1 and then the ph was adjusted to 7 with naoh and h2so4 solutions chlorination was conducted in headspace free amber glass bottles at 20 c the contact times of aliquots 2 14 were 10 min 20 min 30 min 45 min 1 h 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h 12 h 24 h 36 h and 48 h respectively for the two sets of samples after the contact times the chlorine residual in each aliquot was measured by the dpd ferrous titrimetric method apha et al 1995 and then dechlorinated with 105 of the requisite stoichiometric amount of nh4cl triplicate samples were prepared to examine the factors affecting the decomposition of bmaa or dab during chlorination three sets of chlorinated bmaa or dab samples were prepared to examine the effect of chlorine dose six aliquots 100 ml of a bmaa or dab solution 100 Î¼g l were prepared for the six aliquots naocl was dosed at 15 30 60 120 240 and 600 Î¼g l as cl2 cl2 n molar ratio 0 125 0 25 0 5 1 2 and 5 respectively and then the ph was adjusted to 7 with naoh and h2so4 solutions chlorination was conducted in headspace free amber glass bottles at 20 c the contact times were 2 h for the chlorinated bmaa samples and 1 h for the chlorinated dab samples after the contact times the chlorine residual in each aliquot was measured by the dpd ferrous titrimetric method apha et al 1995 and then dechlorinated with 105 of the requisite stoichiometric amount of nh4cl notably the cl2 n molar ratios adopted in this study were selected based on previous studies it has been reported that the average concentration of dissolved organic nitrogen in source waters was around 0 19 mg l as n i e 13 6 Î¼m lee et al 2006 and the free chlorine dose in drinking water treatment plants was generally below 5 mg l as cl2 i e 70 4 Î¼m mostly below 3 mg l as cl2 i e 42 3 Î¼m connell et al 2000 thus the cl2 n molar ratios in drinking water treatment plants were generally below 5 1 mostly below 3 1 in this study we selected the cl2 n molar ratios of 0 125 1 5 1 for investigation which were generally in accordance with the cl2 n molar ratios in drinking water treatment plants to examine the effect of ph six aliquots 100 ml of a bmaa or dab solution 100 Î¼g l were prepared for all the aliquots naocl was dosed at 120 Î¼g l as cl2 cl2 n molar ratio 1 1 the ph of the six aliquots was adjusted to 4 6 7 8 9 and 10 respectively with naoh and h2so4 solutions chlorination was conducted in headspace free amber glass bottles at 20 c the contact times were 2 h for the chlorinated bmaa samples and 1 h for the chlorinated dab samples after the contact times the chlorine residual in each aliquot was measured by the dpd ferrous titrimetric method apha et al 1995 and then dechlorinated with 105 of the requisite stoichiometric amount of nh4cl to examine the effect of temperature three aliquots 100 ml of a bmaa or dab solution 100 Î¼g l were prepared for all the aliquots naocl was dosed at 120 Î¼g l as cl2 cl2 n molar ratio 1 1 and then the ph was adjusted to 7 with naoh and h2so4 solutions chlorination was conducted in headspace free amber glass bottles at 10 20 and 30 c for the three aliquots respectively the contact times were 2 h for the chlorinated bmaa samples and 1 h for the chlorinated dab samples after the contact times the chlorine residual in each aliquot was measured by the dpd ferrous titrimetric method apha et al 1995 and then dechlorinated with 105 of the requisite stoichiometric amount of nh4cl similarly to examine the factors affecting the formation of dbps during chlorination of bmaa or dab three sets of chlorinated bmaa or dab samples were prepared to investigate the effect of chlorine dose ph and temperature respectively the sample preparation was the same as before except that the contact time for these samples was 24 h triplicate samples were prepared 2 4 pretreatment of chlorinated samples the samples for bmaa or dab analysis were pretreated with spe oasis mcx cartridges 60 mg 3 cc were used for eliminating the matrices in the chlorinated samples firstly the spe cartridges were conditioned prior to use with 3 ml of methanol followed by 3 ml of ultrapure water then 1 ml of a sample was loaded onto the cartridges at a flow rate of 10 ml min after adsorption elution with 2 ml of methanol containing 0 1 formic acid followed by 2 ml of methanol containing 5 nh3 h2o was performed finally the eluent was mixed and evaporated to 0 3 ml diluted with acetonitrile water v v 1 1 containing 0 1 formic acid to 1 ml spiked with simetone as the internal standard and then filtered with a 0 22 Î¼m membrane before hplc ms ms analysis the samples for dbps analysis were pretreated following the u s epa method 551 1 and 552 3 u s epa 1995 2003 2 5 sample analysis bmaa and dab were determined with an ab sciex esi tqms ab sciex api4000 coupled by an agilent hplc system agilent technologies g1316a 1260 tcc a zic hilic column 3 5 Î¼m 150 2 1 mm merck was used for chromatographic separation bmaa and dab were analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode thms haas and hans were determined with a gas chromatograph agilent 7890a equipped with an electron capture detector gc ecd a db 1 capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 1 Î¼m film thickness was used for separation the instrument parameters are detailed in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of bmaa and dab in source water samples as listed in si table s3 for the analysis of bmaa and dab in this study the detection limits were 0 2 and 1 4 ng l respectively the recoveries were in the range of 90 110 and the precisions were in the range of 1 2 8 7 besides bmaa and dab were not detected in the solvent blank sample as well as the spe blank sample si figs s2 s3 indicating that the detection and pretreatment processes did not introduce any contamination the ten source water samples were collected from taihu lake at different locations during a cyanobacterial bloom both bmaa and dab were detected in all the samples and their concentrations are shown in si fig s4 the concentrations of bmaa in the ten samples were in the range of 0 89 230 8 ng l while that of dab were ranged from 1 83 to 2 09 ng l the samples from y3 w1 and w4 which contained relatively high levels of bmaa were in the zones with the most severe cyanobacterial bloom which was in accordance with a previous study reporting the spatial distribution of mcs in taihu lake shi et al 2015 notably bmaa and dab were widely present in the source water of taihu lake and they may undergo decomposition during pre chlorination of water treatment and also be organic precursors to form dbps during pre chlorination as well as chlorine disinfection 3 2 decomposition kinetics of bmaa and dab and formation of dbps during chlorination 3 2 1 decomposition kinetics of bmaa and dab during chlorination the concentrations of bmaa and dab with contact time during chlorination are shown in fig 2 a and the corresponding decomposition percentages are presented in fig 2b the initial concentration of both bmaa and dab was 100 Î¼g l for bmaa the concentration decreased continuously to 0 7 Î¼g l within 6 h and the decomposition percentage reached 99 3 at 6 h afterwards the decomposition percentage generally kept stable until 48 h indicating that the decomposition of bmaa was complete within 6 h for dab the concentration decreased continuously to 3 3 Î¼g l within 1 5 h and the decomposition percentage reached 96 7 at 1 5 h the decomposition percentage generally kept stable from 1 5 h to 48 h indicating that the decomposition of dab was complete within 1 5 h based on the concentrations of bmaa and dab at different contact times the decomposition kinetics of bmaa and dab was explored and the results are shown in fig 2c and d and table 1 according to the regression analysis the decomposition of both bmaa and dab followed pseudo first order decay higher r2 values a previous study reported that the decomposition of another algal toxin mc lr also followed pseudo first order decay acero et al 2005 furthermore the apparent rate constant of dab k 2 04 h 1 was significantly higher than that of bmaa k 0 988 h 1 indicating that the decomposition of dab was significantly faster than that of bmaa which might be due to the differences in their chemical structures previous studies have reported that the reaction between amino acids and chlorine started with the electrophilic attack of hocl to the amino groups armesto et al 1993 na and olson 2007 for bmaa one amino group is primary and the other one is secondary which are at Î± and Î² sites while for dab both of the amino groups are primary which are at Î± and Î³ sites the amino groups in dab might be more reactive towards the electrophilic attack of hocl resulting in the higher reactivity of dab compared with that of bmaa 3 2 2 formation of dbps from bmaa and dab during chlorination the formation of the five dbps including trichloromethane tcm dichloroacetic acid dcaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa dichloroacetonitrile dcan and trichloroacetonitrile tcan from bmaa and dab during chlorination was studied the linear ranges detection limits recoveries and precisions for the analysis of the dbps are shown in si table s4 the concentrations of tcm in chlorinated bmaa and dab samples with contact time are presented in fig 3a during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of tcm kept increasing from 0 to 27 0 Î¼g l within 10 h and then was relatively stable until 24 h while during the chlorination of dab it kept increasing from 0 to 28 0 Î¼g l within 10 h and then was relatively stable until 24 h the formation of tcm from dab was slightly higher than that from bmaa at different contact times the concentrations of dcaa and tcaa in chlorinated bmaa and dab samples with contact time are presented in fig 3b during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of dcaa increased continuously from 0 to 26 0 Î¼g l within 12 h which kept stable until 24 h while that of tcaa kept increasing from 0 to 11 0 Î¼g l until 24 h during the chlorination of dab the concentration of dcaa also increased continuously from 0 to 26 0 Î¼g l within 12 h which kept relatively stable until 24 h while that of tcaa kept increasing from 0 to 11 5 Î¼g l until 24 h the formation of dcaa and tcaa from dab was slightly higher than that from bmaa at different contact times and the formation of dcaa was significantly higher than that of tcaa from both bmaa and dab the concentrations of dcan and tcan in chlorinated bmaa and dab samples with contact time are presented in fig 3c during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of dcan increased from 0 to 35 0 Î¼g l within 4 h and then decreased continuously to 23 0 Î¼g l until 24 h while that of tcan increased from 0 to 15 0 Î¼g l within 2 h and then decreased continuously to 3 0 Î¼g l until 24 h during the chlorination of dab the concentration of dcan kept increasing from 0 to 40 0 Î¼g l within 6 h and then decreased continuously to 33 0 Î¼g l until 24 h while that of tcan kept increasing from 0 to 27 0 Î¼g l within 4 h and then decreased continuously to 11 0 Î¼g l until 24 h the results indicated that the formation of dcan and tcan decreased with relatively long contact times which might be owing to the decomposition of dcan and tcan via hydrolysis and chlorination reactions to form other dbps such as haloacetamides haas and thms glezer et al 1999 li et al 2009 which was in agreement with the proposed formation pathways section 3 3 fig 4c the formation of dcan was significantly higher than that of tcan from both bmaa and dab previous studies also reported that another algal toxin mc lr generated significant higher levels of dcan than tcan during chlorination chu et al 2017 different from the c dbps tcm dcaa and tcaa the formation of dcan and tcan from dab was significantly higher than that from bmaa at different contact times which might be owing to the differences in formation pathways of hans from bmaa and dab section 3 3 to compare the formation of tcm dcaa tcaa dcan and tcan from bmaa and dab with that from other organic precursors the dbp tcm dcaa tcaa dcan or tcan yield of each carbon atom from organic precursors was calculated according to the following equation dbp yield of each carbon atom m o l a r c o n c e n t r a t i o n o f a d b p i n i t i a l m o l a r c o n c e n t r a t i o n o f p r e c u r s o r n u m b e r o f c a r b o n a t o m s i n p r e c u r s o r the tcm dcaa tcaa dcan and tcan yields of each carbon atom from different organic precursors including amino acids pharmaceuticals and mcs are summarized in si tables s5 s7 notably it was found that the tcm yields of each carbon atom from bmaa 6 69 and dab 6 96 were significantly higher than that from other organic precursors 0 02 0 87 especially higher than mc lr 0 87 which is a typical algal toxin and has been previously reported to show relatively high tcm yield of each carbon atom among various organic precursors chu et al 2012 2016 2017 hureiki et al 1994 similarly the dcaa tcaa dcan and tcan yields of each carbon atom from bmaa 0 61 6 16 and dab 2 08 8 85 were also found to be much higher than that from other organic precursors below 0 67 hong et al 2009 jia et al 2016 therefore bmaa and dab might be two important organic precursors of thms haas and hans in concern owing to their high dbps yields compared with other typical dbps precursors 3 3 formation pathways of dbps from bmaa and dab during chlorination 3 3 1 proposed formation pathways of thms haas and hans from bmaa during chlorination the formation pathways of thms haas and hans from bmaa during chlorination were tentatively proposed based on the reactions in previous studies and are presented in fig 4a previous studies reported that the reaction between amino acids and chlorine started with the electrophilic attack of hocl to the amino groups armesto et al 1993 na and olson 2007 and thus bmaa might first undergo chlorine substitution on the Î± amino group to form the dichloro species based on the reactions in previous studies the formed dichloro species was unstable and might further undergo decarboxylation chlorine substitution hydrolysis reactions and rearrangement to form chloral blatchley et al 2003 boyce 1983 stanbro and smith 1979 according to the formation pathways of tcm in previous studies chloral might decompose to generate tcm blatchley et al 2003 li et al 2009 similarly bmaa might first undergo a series of chlorine substitution decarboxylation hydrolysis reactions and rearrangement to form 2 n methylamino 2 2 dichloroacetic acid which might further decompose to generate dcaa blatchley et al 2003 boyce 1983 stanbro and smith 1979 dcaa might continue to react with hocl to form tcaa besides bmaa might also undergo a series of chlorine substitution decarboxylation hydrolysis reactions and rearrangement to form 2 n methylamino 2 2 dichloroacetonitrile which might further decompose to form dcan stanbro and smith 1979 dcan might continue to react with hocl to form tcan in addition according to previous studies tcm dcaa and tcaa might also be generated from dcan during chlorination glezer et al 1999 li et al 2009 as shown in fig 4c dcan might undergo a series of chlorine substitution hydrolysis reactions and rearrangement to form chlorine substituted acetamide which might further undergo hydrolysis chlorine substitution decarboxylation reactions and rearrangement to generate dcaa tcaa and tcm chu et al 2009 glezer et al 1999 3 3 2 proposed formation pathways of thms haas and hans from dab during chlorination the proposed formation pathways of thms haas and hans from dab during chlorination are shown in fig 4b the proposed formation pathways of thms and haas from dab during chlorination were generally the same as that from bmaa but the formation pathways of hans from dab were partially different from that of bmaa due to the differences of the amino groups in bmaa and dab for bmaa only the Î± amino group might be involved in the formation of dcan and tcan while for dab both the Î± and Î³ amino groups might be involved besides the Î± amino group the Î³ amino group in dab might also contribute to the nitrogen in dcan and tcan as shown in fig 4b dab might undergo a series of chlorine substitution decarboxylation hydrolysis reactions and rearrangement to form dcan blatchley et al 2003 boyce 1983 stanbro and smith 1979 dcan might further react with hocl to form tcan the proposed formation pathways were in accordance with the results demonstrating that the formation of dcan and tcan from dab was significantly higher than that from bmaa fig 3 c while the formation of tcm dcaa and tcaa from dab was just slightly higher than that from bmaa fig 3a and b 3 3 3 verification of the proposed formation pathways notably the formation pathways in this study were generally proposed based on the reactions in previous studies to verify the proposed formation pathways of thms haas and hans from bmaa and dab during chlorination theoretical calculations were performed using gaussian 09 software at the b3lyp 3 21g level firstly the 2fed2 homo values of the atoms in bmaa and dab were calculated based on the frontier molecular orbital theory a larger 2fed2 homo value indicates higher susceptibility to obtain electrophilic attacks as shown in table 2 5n fig 1 in both bmaa 0 65 and dab 0 78 had the highest 2fed2 homo values thus the site of 5n should be most easily attacked by electrophiles which supported the proposed formation pathways secondly the entropy Î´s enthalpy Î´h and gibbs free energy Î´g of all the reactions in the proposed formation pathways were calculated notably since the reactions a9 and b9 contain more than one single reaction the Î´s Î´h and Î´g of them are not available as shown in si tables s8 s10 Î´g values of all the reactions at 20 c were below 0 kj mol 1 suggesting that all the reactions in the proposed formation pathways were favorable and thus the proposed formation pathways should be reasonable 3 4 factors affecting the decomposition of bmaa and dab and formation of dbps during chlorination 3 4 1 chlorine dose to examine the effects of different factors on the decomposition of bmaa or dab during chlorination the contact time at which the decomposition of bmaa or dab was moderate neither too low nor too high was favored it was found that with the contact time of 2 h for bmaa or 1 h for dab the decomposition percentage of bmaa or dab was neither too low nor too high thus the contact times of 2 h for bmaa and 1 h for dab were selected for investigation the effect of chlorine dose on the decomposition of bmaa and dab and the formation of dbps during chlorination is presented in fig 5 as shown in fig 5a with the increasing cl2 n molar ratio from 0 125 to 5 the decomposition percentage of bmaa increased from 60 0 to 94 0 while that of dab increased from 35 0 to 90 0 indicating that increasing the chlorine dose accelerated the decomposition of bmaa and dab the results were in agreement with a previous study demonstrating that the decomposition percentages of various amino acids increased with the increasing cl2 n molar ratio during chlorination na and olson 2007 in the previous study the decomposition percentages of various amino acids approached 100 with the cl2 n molar ratio higher than 1 5 due to the reaction of cl2 with the amino groups na and olson 2007 in this study the decomposition percentages of bmaa and dab also reached 85 0 and 90 0 respectively with the cl2 n molar ratio of 2 for the formation of dbps as shown in fig 5b during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of tcm increased from 9 0 to 26 0 Î¼g l when the cl2 n molar ratio increased from 0 125 to 1 but decreased continuously to 15 0 Î¼g l when the cl2 n molar ratio further increased until 5 the reason might be that with higher chlorine doses some other dbps were more easily generated from bmaa decreasing the precursors for the formation of tcm but during the chlorination of dab the concentration of tcm kept increasing from 6 0 to 80 0 Î¼g l when the cl2 n molar ratio increased from 0 125 to 5 dab might be more active than bmaa in forming tcm with high doses of chlorine the formation of dcaa and tcaa from bmaa and dab with different cl2 n molar ratios during chlorination is shown in fig 5c during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of dcaa increased from 10 0 to 34 0 Î¼g l with the increasing cl2 n molar ratio from 0 125 to 5 while that of tcaa increased from 5 0 to 15 0 Î¼g l suggesting that the formation of both dcaa and tcaa increased with the increasing cl2 n molar ratio similar results were obtained for dab with the concentration of dcaa increasing from 11 0 to 40 0 Î¼g l and that of tcaa increasing from 4 0 to 16 0 Î¼g l the formation of haas increased with the increasing chlorine dose during chlorination of both bmaa and dab indicating that high chlorine doses favored the formation of haas from the two organic precursors during chlorination previous studies also demonstrated that increasing the chlorine dose enhanced the formation of haas during chlorination of raw waters hua and reckhow 2008 the formation of dcan and tcan from bmaa and dab with different cl2 n molar ratios during chlorination is shown in fig 5d which was similar to that of dcaa and tcaa during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of dcan increased from 9 0 to 30 0 Î¼g l and that of tcan increased from 1 0 to 10 0 Î¼g l with the increasing cl2 n molar ratio from 0 125 to 5 while during the chlorination of dab the concentration of dcan increased from 18 0 to 40 0 Î¼g l and that of tcan increased from 4 0 to 22 0 Î¼g l the results indicated that higher chlorine doses favored the formation of hans from the two organic precursors during chlorination a previous study also reported that the formation of dcan increased with the increasing chlorine mc lr molar ratio chu et al 2017 notably the formation of hans from dab was significantly higher than that from bmaa with various chlorine doses which supported the proposed formation pathways of hans as elaborated above generally higher cl2 n molar ratios favored the formation of thms haas and hans from bmaa and dab during chlorination thus on the basis of disinfection efficiency fulfillment lower chlorine doses might be recommended in drinking water treatment plants 3 4 2 ph the effect of ph on the decomposition of bmaa and dab and the formation of dbps during chlorination is shown in si fig s5 as shown in fig s5a the decomposition percentage of bmaa decreased from 100 to 73 0 with the increasing ph from 4 to 10 while that of dab decreased from 95 0 to 70 0 indicating that acidic conditions favored the decomposition of bmaa and dab during chlorination this might be mainly attributed to the speciation of bmaa dab and hocl at different ph values na and olson 2007 a previous study also reported that the reaction rate constant of mc lr with chlorine decreased continuously with the increasing ph from 4 to 9 acero et al 2005 for the formation of dbps as shown in fig s5b during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of tcm increased from 16 0 to 31 0 Î¼g l when the ph increased from 4 to 9 and kept relatively stable when the ph further increased to 10 while during the chlorination of dab the concentration of tcm increased from 21 0 to 35 0 Î¼g l when the ph increased from 4 to 9 and kept relatively stable when the ph further increased to 10 it has been reported that alkaline conditions favored the formation of thms hua and reckhow 2008 2012 which was owing to the base catalyzed reactions in thms formation peters et al 1980 reckhow et al 1990 a previous study also demonstrated that the formation of thms increased with the increasing ph during the chlorination of mc lr chu et al 2017 the formation of dcaa and tcaa from bmaa and dab with different phs during chlorination is shown in fig s5c during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of dcaa decreased continuously from 44 0 to 18 0 Î¼g l with the increasing ph from 4 to 10 while that of tcaa decreased from 21 0 to 4 0 Î¼g l similar results were obtained for dab with the concentration of dcaa decreasing from 34 0 to 13 0 Î¼g l and that of tcaa decreasing from 20 0 to 4 0 Î¼g l the formation of haas decreased with the increasing ph during the chlorination of both bmaa and dab suggesting that lower ph favored the formation of haas which was in agreement with previous studies hua and reckhow 2008 the formation of dcan and tcan from bmaa and dab with different phs during chlorination is shown in fig s5d which was similar to that of dcaa and tcaa during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of dcan decreased from 33 0 to 16 0 Î¼g l and that of tcan decreased from 9 0 to 4 0 Î¼g l with the increasing ph while during the chlorination of dab the concentration of dcan decreased from 45 0 to 16 0 Î¼g l and that of tcan decreased from 20 0 to 4 0 Î¼g l the results indicated that lower ph favored the formation of hans which might be owing to the enhanced decomposition of hans with higher ph glezer et al 1999 3 4 3 temperature the effect of temperature on the decomposition of bmaa and dab and the formation of dbps during chlorination is shown in si fig s6 as shown in fig s6a the decomposition percentage of bmaa increased from 63 0 to 84 0 when the temperature increased from 10 to 20 c but did not show a significant change when the temperature further increased to 30 c similarly the decomposition percentage of dab increased from 61 0 to 85 0 when the temperature increased from 10 to 20 c but did not show a significant change when the temperature further increased to 30 c for the formation of dbps as shown in fig s6b during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of tcm increased from 11 0 to 51 0 Î¼g l when the temperature increased from 10 to 30 c while during the chlorination of dab the concentration of tcm increased from 12 0 to 32 0 Î¼g l when the temperature increased from 10 to 30 c suggesting that increasing the temperature enhanced the formation of tcm previous studies also reported that higher temperature favored the formation of thms hua and reckhow 2008 the formation of dcaa and tcaa from bmaa and dab with different temperatures during chlorination is shown in fig s6c during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of dcaa increased continuously from 18 0 to 39 0 Î¼g l with the increasing temperature from 10 to 30 c while that of tcaa increased from 8 0 to 16 0 Î¼g l similar results were obtained for dab with the concentration of dcaa increasing from 16 0 to 33 0 Î¼g l and that of tcaa increasing from 9 0 to 15 0 Î¼g l the formation of haas increased with the increasing temperature during the chlorination of both bmaa and dab suggesting that higher temperature favored the formation of haas which was in accordance with previous studies demonstrating that increasing the temperature enhanced the formation of haas hua and reckhow 2008 the formation of dcan and tcan from bmaa and dab with different temperatures during chlorination is shown in fig s6d during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of dcan decreased from 29 0 to 20 0 Î¼g l and that of tcan decreased from 7 0 to 4 0 Î¼g l with the increasing temperature while during the chlorination of dab the concentration of dcan decreased from 38 0 to 32 0 Î¼g l and that of tcan decreased from 19 0 to 13 0 Î¼g l the results indicated that increasing the temperature decreased the formation of hans which might be owing to the enhanced hydrolysis of hans with higher temperatures glezer et al 1999 notably the effect of temperature on the formation of hans was not so significant as that of ph 4 conclusions in this study the decomposition of bmaa and dab during chlorination and the consequent dbps formation were investigated it was found that bmaa and dab were commonly detected in source waters from taihu lake in china and the highest level of bmaa reached 230 8 ng l while the concentrations of dab were generally around 2 0 ng l the decomposition of bmaa and dab both followed pseudo first order decay while the decomposition rate constant of dab was significant higher than that of bmaa thms haas and hans were all generated during the chlorination of bmaa and dab with relatively high yields notably the thms haas and hans yields of each carbon atom from bmaa and dab were significantly higher than that from other organic precursors and the formation of hans from dab was significantly higher than that from bmaa the formation pathways of dbps from bmaa and dab were tentatively proposed and verified through theoretical calculations of note the proposed formation pathways of thms and haas from bmaa were similar to that from dab while the proposed formation pathways of hans from bmaa and dab showed some differences

during chlorination graphical abstract image 1 keywords algal toxins bmaa dab chlorination decomposition dbps formation 1 introduction excessive nutrient loading results in eutrophication of surface waters which may further lead to cyanobacterial blue green algae blooms merel et al 2013 cyanobacteria are able to release harmful algal toxins which comprise more than 100 compounds with varying chemical structures and toxicological properties lawton et al 1994 merel et al 2013 due to the negative effects to human health briand et al 2003 griffiths and saker 2003 kuiper goodman et al 1999 pouria et al 1998 algal toxins have become a serious public concern recently algal toxins mainly include hepatotoxins acting on the liver neurotoxins acting on the nervous system and dermatotoxins causing skin irritation merel et al 2013 among them microcystins mcs a class of hepatotoxins are a main family of algal toxins which have been most frequently studied due to their wide occurrence fristachi and sinclair 2008 a guideline limit of 1 Î¼g l for mc lr one of the most common mcs has been proposed by the world health organization in drinking water who 1998 recently a neurotoxin Î² n methylamino l alanine bmaa has been newly identified in different countries all over the world brand et al 2010 esterhuizen and downing 2008 johnson et al 2008 li et al 2010 metcalf et al 2008 it has been reported that this algal toxin may be produced by all known categories of cyanobacteria cox et al 2005 and thus it may be widely present in surface waters with cyanobacteria however as a novel algal toxin bmaa has not been extensively studied yet bmaa is a non protein amino acid with a molecular weight of 118 da as shown in fig 1 a it mainly acts on motor neurons and could also lead to intraneuronal protein misfolding banack et al 2010 bmaa is assumed to be related to different neurodegenerative diseases banack et al 2010 murch et al 2004 pablo et al 2009 nevertheless owing to the lack of toxicological data no guideline for bmaa has been proposed in drinking water besides 2 4 diaminobutyric acid dab fig 1b an isomer of bmaa was also detected in cyanobacteria samples krÃ¼ger et al 2010 rosÃ©n and hellenÃ¤s 2008 dab is neurotoxic through inhibition of the absorption of the neurotransmitter g aminobutyric acid in neurons and glia cells iversen and kelly 1975 as two novel algal toxins bmaa and dab call for further investigation due to their ubiquity in source waters and diverse adverse effects pre oxidation is widely adopted to oxidize constituents in source waters to facilitate their removal during water treatment and especially it is widely applied for the pretreatment of algae containing source waters henderson et al 2008 hoko and makado 2011 plummer and edzwald 2002 pre chlorination is one of the most commonly used pre oxidation methods the algal toxins in source waters may undergo decomposition during pre chlorination acero et al 2005 and some disinfection byproducts dbps may also be generated from the algal toxins during this process chu et al 2017 besides the conventional water treatment system is capable of removing algal cells and the majority of intracellular algal toxins effectively but it poorly removes extracellular algal toxins which are released by cyanobacteria to water thus the remaining algal toxins in water may also further react with chlorine to form dbps during chlorine disinfection previous studies have reported the formation of various dbps including trihalomethanes thms haloaldehydes and haloacetonitriles hans from mc lr during chlorination chu et al 2017 however up to now few studies have reported the decomposition of the novel algal toxins bmaa and dab during water chlorination and the consequent dbps formation which may be a critical issue that should be concerned generally the organic dbps in disinfected waters can be categorized to carbonaceous dbps c dbps and nitrogenous dbps n dbps richardson et al 2007 thms and haloacetic acids haas are the two classes of c dbps regulated by u s epa and thus they have received the most public concern richardson et al 2007 dihalo and trihalo species of haas were the most commonly detected in disinfected waters richardson et al 2007 n dbps are generally more toxic than c dbps muellner et al 2007 richardson et al 2007 and thus they have attracted more and more attention hans are an important class of n dbps which were widely detected with relatively high concentrations in disinfected waters krasner et al 1989 richardson et al 2007 williams et al 1997 dihalo and trihalo species of hans were the most commonly detected richardson et al 2007 since algal toxins contain nitrogen the formation of n dbps from bmaa and dab should not be ignored thus the formation of the three important classes of c dbps and n dbps thms haas and hans from bmaa and dab during chlorination should be concerned thus the purposes of this study were to determine the concentrations of bmaa and dab in source waters to investigate the decomposition kinetics of bmaa and dab and the formation of thms haas and hans from bmaa and dab during chlorination to explore the formation pathways of thms haas and hans from bmaa and dab during chlorination and to examine the effects of different factors on the decomposition of bmaa and dab and the formation of dbps during chlorination 2

ultrapure water 18 2 mÏ cm was supplied by a simplicity uv ultrapure water system merck millipore 2 2 collection and pretreatment of source water samples from taihu lake the source water samples were collected in october 2015 during a cyanobacterial bloom at 10 different locations from taihu lake the distribution of the sampling points is presented in fig s1 and table s1 in the supporting information si the collected source water samples were filtered with 0 45 Î¼m membrane and then stored at 4 c to minimize changes in constituents prior to pretreatment the samples were brought back to room temperature oasis mcx cartridges 500 mg 6 cc were used for preconcentration of bmaa and dab in the collected source water samples firstly the solid phase extraction spe cartridges were conditioned prior to use with 5 ml of methanol followed by 5 ml of ultrapure water then 1 l of a sample was loaded onto the cartridges at a flow rate of 20 ml min after adsorption elution with 5 ml of methanol containing 0 1 formic acid followed by 5 ml of methanol containing 5 nh3 h2o was performed finally the eluent was mixed and evaporated to 0 3 ml diluted with acetonitrile water v v 1 1 containing 0 1 formic acid to 1 ml spiked with simetone as the internal standard and then filtered with a 0 22 Î¼m membrane before hplc ms ms analysis triplicate samples were prepared 2 3 preparation of chlorinated samples to investigate the decomposition kinetics of bmaa or dab during chlorination a set of chlorinated bmaa or dab samples with different contact times were prepared fourteen aliquots 100 ml of a bmaa or dab solution 100 Î¼g l were prepared for aliquot 1 no naocl was dosed for aliquots 2 14 naocl was dosed at 5 mg l as cl2 in high excess compared with bmaa or dab and then the ph was adjusted to 7 with naoh and h2so4 solutions chlorination was conducted in headspace free amber glass bottles at 20 c the contact times of aliquots 2 14 were 2 min 5 min 10 min 20 min 30 min 50 min 1 5 h 3 h 6 h 12 h 24 h 36 h and 48 h respectively notably to better determine the decomposition kinetics of bmaa or dab during chlorination a relatively high concentration of bmaa or dab 100 Î¼g l and a relatively long reaction time range 0 48 h were adopted in this study to study the formation of dbps during chlorination another set of chlorinated bmaa or dab samples with different contact times were prepared fourteen aliquots 100 ml of a bmaa or dab solution 100 Î¼g l were prepared for aliquot 1 no naocl was dosed for aliquots 2 14 naocl was dosed at 120 Î¼g l as cl2 cl2 n molar ratio 1 1 and then the ph was adjusted to 7 with naoh and h2so4 solutions chlorination was conducted in headspace free amber glass bottles at 20 c the contact times of aliquots 2 14 were 10 min 20 min 30 min 45 min 1 h 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h 12 h 24 h 36 h and 48 h respectively for the two sets of samples after the contact times the chlorine residual in each aliquot was measured by the dpd ferrous titrimetric method apha et al 1995 and then dechlorinated with 105 of the requisite stoichiometric amount of nh4cl triplicate samples were prepared to examine the factors affecting the decomposition of bmaa or dab during chlorination three sets of chlorinated bmaa or dab samples were prepared to examine the effect of chlorine dose six aliquots 100 ml of a bmaa or dab solution 100 Î¼g l were prepared for the six aliquots naocl was dosed at 15 30 60 120 240 and 600 Î¼g l as cl2 cl2 n molar ratio 0 125 0 25 0 5 1 2 and 5 respectively and then the ph was adjusted to 7 with naoh and h2so4 solutions chlorination was conducted in headspace free amber glass bottles at 20 c the contact times were 2 h for the chlorinated bmaa samples and 1 h for the chlorinated dab samples after the contact times the chlorine residual in each aliquot was measured by the dpd ferrous titrimetric method apha et al 1995 and then dechlorinated with 105 of the requisite stoichiometric amount of nh4cl notably the cl2 n molar ratios adopted in this study were selected based on previous studies it has been reported that the average concentration of dissolved organic nitrogen in source waters was around 0 19 mg l as n i e 13 6 Î¼m lee et al 2006 and the free chlorine dose in drinking water treatment plants was generally below 5 mg l as cl2 i e 70 4 Î¼m mostly below 3 mg l as cl2 i e 42 3 Î¼m connell et al 2000 thus the cl2 n molar ratios in drinking water treatment plants were generally below 5 1 mostly below 3 1 in this study we selected the cl2 n molar ratios of 0 125 1 5 1 for investigation which were generally in accordance with the cl2 n molar ratios in drinking water treatment plants to examine the effect of ph six aliquots 100 ml of a bmaa or dab solution 100 Î¼g l were prepared for all the aliquots naocl was dosed at 120 Î¼g l as cl2 cl2 n molar ratio 1 1 the ph of the six aliquots was adjusted to 4 6 7 8 9 and 10 respectively with naoh and h2so4 solutions chlorination was conducted in headspace free amber glass bottles at 20 c the contact times were 2 h for the chlorinated bmaa samples and 1 h for the chlorinated dab samples after the contact times the chlorine residual in each aliquot was measured by the dpd ferrous titrimetric method apha et al 1995 and then dechlorinated with 105 of the requisite stoichiometric amount of nh4cl to examine the effect of temperature three aliquots 100 ml of a bmaa or dab solution 100 Î¼g l were prepared for all the aliquots naocl was dosed at 120 Î¼g l as cl2 cl2 n molar ratio 1 1 and then the ph was adjusted to 7 with naoh and h2so4 solutions chlorination was conducted in headspace free amber glass bottles at 10 20 and 30 c for the three aliquots respectively the contact times were 2 h for the chlorinated bmaa samples and 1 h for the chlorinated dab samples after the contact times the chlorine residual in each aliquot was measured by the dpd ferrous titrimetric method apha et al 1995 and then dechlorinated with 105 of the requisite stoichiometric amount of nh4cl similarly to examine the factors affecting the formation of dbps during chlorination of bmaa or dab three sets of chlorinated bmaa or dab samples were prepared to investigate the effect of chlorine dose ph and temperature respectively the sample preparation was the same as before except that the contact time for these samples was 24 h triplicate samples were prepared 2 4 pretreatment of chlorinated samples the samples for bmaa or dab analysis were pretreated with spe oasis mcx cartridges 60 mg 3 cc were used for eliminating the matrices in the chlorinated samples firstly the spe cartridges were conditioned prior to use with 3 ml of methanol followed by 3 ml of ultrapure water then 1 ml of a sample was loaded onto the cartridges at a flow rate of 10 ml min after adsorption elution with 2 ml of methanol containing 0 1 formic acid followed by 2 ml of methanol containing 5 nh3 h2o was performed finally the eluent was mixed and evaporated to 0 3 ml diluted with acetonitrile water v v 1 1 containing 0 1 formic acid to 1 ml spiked with simetone as the internal standard and then filtered with a 0 22 Î¼m membrane before hplc ms ms analysis the samples for dbps analysis were pretreated following the u s epa method 551 1 and 552 3 u s epa 1995 2003 2 5 sample analysis bmaa and dab were determined with an ab sciex esi tqms ab sciex api4000 coupled by an agilent hplc system agilent technologies g1316a 1260 tcc a zic hilic column 3 5 Î¼m 150 2 1 mm merck was used for chromatographic separation bmaa and dab were analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode thms haas and hans were determined with a gas chromatograph agilent 7890a equipped with an electron capture detector gc ecd a db 1 capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 1 Î¼m film thickness was used for separation the instrument parameters are detailed in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of bmaa and dab in source water samples as listed in si table s3 for the analysis of bmaa and dab in this study the detection limits were 0 2 and 1 4 ng l respectively the recoveries were in the range of 90 110 and the precisions were in the range of 1 2 8 7 besides bmaa and dab were not detected in the solvent blank sample as well as the spe blank sample si figs s2 s3 indicating that the detection and pretreatment processes did not introduce any contamination the ten source water samples were collected from taihu lake at different locations during a cyanobacterial bloom both bmaa and dab were detected in all the samples and their concentrations are shown in si fig s4 the concentrations of bmaa in the ten samples were in the range of 0 89 230 8 ng l while that of dab were ranged from 1 83 to 2 09 ng l the samples from y3 w1 and w4 which contained relatively high levels of bmaa were in the zones with the most severe cyanobacterial bloom which was in accordance with a previous study reporting the spatial distribution of mcs in taihu lake shi et al 2015 notably bmaa and dab were widely present in the source water of taihu lake and they may undergo decomposition during pre chlorination of water treatment and also be organic precursors to form dbps during pre chlorination as well as chlorine disinfection 3 2 decomposition kinetics of bmaa and dab and formation of dbps during chlorination 3 2 1 decomposition kinetics of bmaa and dab during chlorination the concentrations of bmaa and dab with contact time during chlorination are shown in fig 2 a and the corresponding decomposition percentages are presented in fig 2b the initial concentration of both bmaa and dab was 100 Î¼g l for bmaa the concentration decreased continuously to 0 7 Î¼g l within 6 h and the decomposition percentage reached 99 3 at 6 h afterwards the decomposition percentage generally kept stable until 48 h indicating that the decomposition of bmaa was complete within 6 h for dab the concentration decreased continuously to 3 3 Î¼g l within 1 5 h and the decomposition percentage reached 96 7 at 1 5 h the decomposition percentage generally kept stable from 1 5 h to 48 h indicating that the decomposition of dab was complete within 1 5 h based on the concentrations of bmaa and dab at different contact times the decomposition kinetics of bmaa and dab was explored and the results are shown in fig 2c and d and table 1 according to the regression analysis the decomposition of both bmaa and dab followed pseudo first order decay higher r2 values a previous study reported that the decomposition of another algal toxin mc lr also followed pseudo first order decay acero et al 2005 furthermore the apparent rate constant of dab k 2 04 h 1 was significantly higher than that of bmaa k 0 988 h 1 indicating that the decomposition of dab was significantly faster than that of bmaa which might be due to the differences in their chemical structures previous studies have reported that the reaction between amino acids and chlorine started with the electrophilic attack of hocl to the amino groups armesto et al 1993 na and olson 2007 for bmaa one amino group is primary and the other one is secondary which are at Î± and Î² sites while for dab both of the amino groups are primary which are at Î± and Î³ sites the amino groups in dab might be more reactive towards the electrophilic attack of hocl resulting in the higher reactivity of dab compared with that of bmaa 3 2 2 formation of dbps from bmaa and dab during chlorination the formation of the five dbps including trichloromethane tcm dichloroacetic acid dcaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa dichloroacetonitrile dcan and trichloroacetonitrile tcan from bmaa and dab during chlorination was studied the linear ranges detection limits recoveries and precisions for the analysis of the dbps are shown in si table s4 the concentrations of tcm in chlorinated bmaa and dab samples with contact time are presented in fig 3a during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of tcm kept increasing from 0 to 27 0 Î¼g l within 10 h and then was relatively stable until 24 h while during the chlorination of dab it kept increasing from 0 to 28 0 Î¼g l within 10 h and then was relatively stable until 24 h the formation of tcm from dab was slightly higher than that from bmaa at different contact times the concentrations of dcaa and tcaa in chlorinated bmaa and dab samples with contact time are presented in fig 3b during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of dcaa increased continuously from 0 to 26 0 Î¼g l within 12 h which kept stable until 24 h while that of tcaa kept increasing from 0 to 11 0 Î¼g l until 24 h during the chlorination of dab the concentration of dcaa also increased continuously from 0 to 26 0 Î¼g l within 12 h which kept relatively stable until 24 h while that of tcaa kept increasing from 0 to 11 5 Î¼g l until 24 h the formation of dcaa and tcaa from dab was slightly higher than that from bmaa at different contact times and the formation of dcaa was significantly higher than that of tcaa from both bmaa and dab the concentrations of dcan and tcan in chlorinated bmaa and dab samples with contact time are presented in fig 3c during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of dcan increased from 0 to 35 0 Î¼g l within 4 h and then decreased continuously to 23 0 Î¼g l until 24 h while that of tcan increased from 0 to 15 0 Î¼g l within 2 h and then decreased continuously to 3 0 Î¼g l until 24 h during the chlorination of dab the concentration of dcan kept increasing from 0 to 40 0 Î¼g l within 6 h and then decreased continuously to 33 0 Î¼g l until 24 h while that of tcan kept increasing from 0 to 27 0 Î¼g l within 4 h and then decreased continuously to 11 0 Î¼g l until 24 h the results indicated that the formation of dcan and tcan decreased with relatively long contact times which might be owing to the decomposition of dcan and tcan via hydrolysis and chlorination reactions to form other dbps such as haloacetamides haas and thms glezer et al 1999 li et al 2009 which was in agreement with the proposed formation pathways section 3 3 fig 4c the formation of dcan was significantly higher than that of tcan from both bmaa and dab previous studies also reported that another algal toxin mc lr generated significant higher levels of dcan than tcan during chlorination chu et al 2017 different from the c dbps tcm dcaa and tcaa the formation of dcan and tcan from dab was significantly higher than that from bmaa at different contact times which might be owing to the differences in formation pathways of hans from bmaa and dab section 3 3 to compare the formation of tcm dcaa tcaa dcan and tcan from bmaa and dab with that from other organic precursors the dbp tcm dcaa tcaa dcan or tcan yield of each carbon atom from organic precursors was calculated according to the following equation dbp yield of each carbon atom m o l a r c o n c e n t r a t i o n o f a d b p i n i t i a l m o l a r c o n c e n t r a t i o n o f p r e c u r s o r n u m b e r o f c a r b o n a t o m s i n p r e c u r s o r the tcm dcaa tcaa dcan and tcan yields of each carbon atom from different organic precursors including amino acids pharmaceuticals and mcs are summarized in si tables s5 s7 notably it was found that the tcm yields of each carbon atom from bmaa 6 69 and dab 6 96 were significantly higher than that from other organic precursors 0 02 0 87 especially higher than mc lr 0 87 which is a typical algal toxin and has been previously reported to show relatively high tcm yield of each carbon atom among various organic precursors chu et al 2012 2016 2017 hureiki et al 1994 similarly the dcaa tcaa dcan and tcan yields of each carbon atom from bmaa 0 61 6 16 and dab 2 08 8 85 were also found to be much higher than that from other organic precursors below 0 67 hong et al 2009 jia et al 2016 therefore bmaa and dab might be two important organic precursors of thms haas and hans in concern owing to their high dbps yields compared with other typical dbps precursors 3 3 formation pathways of dbps from bmaa and dab during chlorination 3 3 1 proposed formation pathways of thms haas and hans from bmaa during chlorination the formation pathways of thms haas and hans from bmaa during chlorination were tentatively proposed based on the reactions in previous studies and are presented in fig 4a previous studies reported that the reaction between amino acids and chlorine started with the electrophilic attack of hocl to the amino groups armesto et al 1993 na and olson 2007 and thus bmaa might first undergo chlorine substitution on the Î± amino group to form the dichloro species based on the reactions in previous studies the formed dichloro species was unstable and might further undergo decarboxylation chlorine substitution hydrolysis reactions and rearrangement to form chloral blatchley et al 2003 boyce 1983 stanbro and smith 1979 according to the formation pathways of tcm in previous studies chloral might decompose to generate tcm blatchley et al 2003 li et al 2009 similarly bmaa might first undergo a series of chlorine substitution decarboxylation hydrolysis reactions and rearrangement to form 2 n methylamino 2 2 dichloroacetic acid which might further decompose to generate dcaa blatchley et al 2003 boyce 1983 stanbro and smith 1979 dcaa might continue to react with hocl to form tcaa besides bmaa might also undergo a series of chlorine substitution decarboxylation hydrolysis reactions and rearrangement to form 2 n methylamino 2 2 dichloroacetonitrile which might further decompose to form dcan stanbro and smith 1979 dcan might continue to react with hocl to form tcan in addition according to previous studies tcm dcaa and tcaa might also be generated from dcan during chlorination glezer et al 1999 li et al 2009 as shown in fig 4c dcan might undergo a series of chlorine substitution hydrolysis reactions and rearrangement to form chlorine substituted acetamide which might further undergo hydrolysis chlorine substitution decarboxylation reactions and rearrangement to generate dcaa tcaa and tcm chu et al 2009 glezer et al 1999 3 3 2 proposed formation pathways of thms haas and hans from dab during chlorination the proposed formation pathways of thms haas and hans from dab during chlorination are shown in fig 4b the proposed formation pathways of thms and haas from dab during chlorination were generally the same as that from bmaa but the formation pathways of hans from dab were partially different from that of bmaa due to the differences of the amino groups in bmaa and dab for bmaa only the Î± amino group might be involved in the formation of dcan and tcan while for dab both the Î± and Î³ amino groups might be involved besides the Î± amino group the Î³ amino group in dab might also contribute to the nitrogen in dcan and tcan as shown in fig 4b dab might undergo a series of chlorine substitution decarboxylation hydrolysis reactions and rearrangement to form dcan blatchley et al 2003 boyce 1983 stanbro and smith 1979 dcan might further react with hocl to form tcan the proposed formation pathways were in accordance with the results demonstrating that the formation of dcan and tcan from dab was significantly higher than that from bmaa fig 3 c while the formation of tcm dcaa and tcaa from dab was just slightly higher than that from bmaa fig 3a and b 3 3 3 verification of the proposed formation pathways notably the formation pathways in this study were generally proposed based on the reactions in previous studies to verify the proposed formation pathways of thms haas and hans from bmaa and dab during chlorination theoretical calculations were performed using gaussian 09 software at the b3lyp 3 21g level firstly the 2fed2 homo values of the atoms in bmaa and dab were calculated based on the frontier molecular orbital theory a larger 2fed2 homo value indicates higher susceptibility to obtain electrophilic attacks as shown in table 2 5n fig 1 in both bmaa 0 65 and dab 0 78 had the highest 2fed2 homo values thus the site of 5n should be most easily attacked by electrophiles which supported the proposed formation pathways secondly the entropy Î´s enthalpy Î´h and gibbs free energy Î´g of all the reactions in the proposed formation pathways were calculated notably since the reactions a9 and b9 contain more than one single reaction the Î´s Î´h and Î´g of them are not available as shown in si tables s8 s10 Î´g values of all the reactions at 20 c were below 0 kj mol 1 suggesting that all the reactions in the proposed formation pathways were favorable and thus the proposed formation pathways should be reasonable 3 4 factors affecting the decomposition of bmaa and dab and formation of dbps during chlorination 3 4 1 chlorine dose to examine the effects of different factors on the decomposition of bmaa or dab during chlorination the contact time at which the decomposition of bmaa or dab was moderate neither too low nor too high was favored it was found that with the contact time of 2 h for bmaa or 1 h for dab the decomposition percentage of bmaa or dab was neither too low nor too high thus the contact times of 2 h for bmaa and 1 h for dab were selected for investigation the effect of chlorine dose on the decomposition of bmaa and dab and the formation of dbps during chlorination is presented in fig 5 as shown in fig 5a with the increasing cl2 n molar ratio from 0 125 to 5 the decomposition percentage of bmaa increased from 60 0 to 94 0 while that of dab increased from 35 0 to 90 0 indicating that increasing the chlorine dose accelerated the decomposition of bmaa and dab the results were in agreement with a previous study demonstrating that the decomposition percentages of various amino acids increased with the increasing cl2 n molar ratio during chlorination na and olson 2007 in the previous study the decomposition percentages of various amino acids approached 100 with the cl2 n molar ratio higher than 1 5 due to the reaction of cl2 with the amino groups na and olson 2007 in this study the decomposition percentages of bmaa and dab also reached 85 0 and 90 0 respectively with the cl2 n molar ratio of 2 for the formation of dbps as shown in fig 5b during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of tcm increased from 9 0 to 26 0 Î¼g l when the cl2 n molar ratio increased from 0 125 to 1 but decreased continuously to 15 0 Î¼g l when the cl2 n molar ratio further increased until 5 the reason might be that with higher chlorine doses some other dbps were more easily generated from bmaa decreasing the precursors for the formation of tcm but during the chlorination of dab the concentration of tcm kept increasing from 6 0 to 80 0 Î¼g l when the cl2 n molar ratio increased from 0 125 to 5 dab might be more active than bmaa in forming tcm with high doses of chlorine the formation of dcaa and tcaa from bmaa and dab with different cl2 n molar ratios during chlorination is shown in fig 5c during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of dcaa increased from 10 0 to 34 0 Î¼g l with the increasing cl2 n molar ratio from 0 125 to 5 while that of tcaa increased from 5 0 to 15 0 Î¼g l suggesting that the formation of both dcaa and tcaa increased with the increasing cl2 n molar ratio similar results were obtained for dab with the concentration of dcaa increasing from 11 0 to 40 0 Î¼g l and that of tcaa increasing from 4 0 to 16 0 Î¼g l the formation of haas increased with the increasing chlorine dose during chlorination of both bmaa and dab indicating that high chlorine doses favored the formation of haas from the two organic precursors during chlorination previous studies also demonstrated that increasing the chlorine dose enhanced the formation of haas during chlorination of raw waters hua and reckhow 2008 the formation of dcan and tcan from bmaa and dab with different cl2 n molar ratios during chlorination is shown in fig 5d which was similar to that of dcaa and tcaa during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of dcan increased from 9 0 to 30 0 Î¼g l and that of tcan increased from 1 0 to 10 0 Î¼g l with the increasing cl2 n molar ratio from 0 125 to 5 while during the chlorination of dab the concentration of dcan increased from 18 0 to 40 0 Î¼g l and that of tcan increased from 4 0 to 22 0 Î¼g l the results indicated that higher chlorine doses favored the formation of hans from the two organic precursors during chlorination a previous study also reported that the formation of dcan increased with the increasing chlorine mc lr molar ratio chu et al 2017 notably the formation of hans from dab was significantly higher than that from bmaa with various chlorine doses which supported the proposed formation pathways of hans as elaborated above generally higher cl2 n molar ratios favored the formation of thms haas and hans from bmaa and dab during chlorination thus on the basis of disinfection efficiency fulfillment lower chlorine doses might be recommended in drinking water treatment plants 3 4 2 ph the effect of ph on the decomposition of bmaa and dab and the formation of dbps during chlorination is shown in si fig s5 as shown in fig s5a the decomposition percentage of bmaa decreased from 100 to 73 0 with the increasing ph from 4 to 10 while that of dab decreased from 95 0 to 70 0 indicating that acidic conditions favored the decomposition of bmaa and dab during chlorination this might be mainly attributed to the speciation of bmaa dab and hocl at different ph values na and olson 2007 a previous study also reported that the reaction rate constant of mc lr with chlorine decreased continuously with the increasing ph from 4 to 9 acero et al 2005 for the formation of dbps as shown in fig s5b during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of tcm increased from 16 0 to 31 0 Î¼g l when the ph increased from 4 to 9 and kept relatively stable when the ph further increased to 10 while during the chlorination of dab the concentration of tcm increased from 21 0 to 35 0 Î¼g l when the ph increased from 4 to 9 and kept relatively stable when the ph further increased to 10 it has been reported that alkaline conditions favored the formation of thms hua and reckhow 2008 2012 which was owing to the base catalyzed reactions in thms formation peters et al 1980 reckhow et al 1990 a previous study also demonstrated that the formation of thms increased with the increasing ph during the chlorination of mc lr chu et al 2017 the formation of dcaa and tcaa from bmaa and dab with different phs during chlorination is shown in fig s5c during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of dcaa decreased continuously from 44 0 to 18 0 Î¼g l with the increasing ph from 4 to 10 while that of tcaa decreased from 21 0 to 4 0 Î¼g l similar results were obtained for dab with the concentration of dcaa decreasing from 34 0 to 13 0 Î¼g l and that of tcaa decreasing from 20 0 to 4 0 Î¼g l the formation of haas decreased with the increasing ph during the chlorination of both bmaa and dab suggesting that lower ph favored the formation of haas which was in agreement with previous studies hua and reckhow 2008 the formation of dcan and tcan from bmaa and dab with different phs during chlorination is shown in fig s5d which was similar to that of dcaa and tcaa during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of dcan decreased from 33 0 to 16 0 Î¼g l and that of tcan decreased from 9 0 to 4 0 Î¼g l with the increasing ph while during the chlorination of dab the concentration of dcan decreased from 45 0 to 16 0 Î¼g l and that of tcan decreased from 20 0 to 4 0 Î¼g l the results indicated that lower ph favored the formation of hans which might be owing to the enhanced decomposition of hans with higher ph glezer et al 1999 3 4 3 temperature the effect of temperature on the decomposition of bmaa and dab and the formation of dbps during chlorination is shown in si fig s6 as shown in fig s6a the decomposition percentage of bmaa increased from 63 0 to 84 0 when the temperature increased from 10 to 20 c but did not show a significant change when the temperature further increased to 30 c similarly the decomposition percentage of dab increased from 61 0 to 85 0 when the temperature increased from 10 to 20 c but did not show a significant change when the temperature further increased to 30 c for the formation of dbps as shown in fig s6b during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of tcm increased from 11 0 to 51 0 Î¼g l when the temperature increased from 10 to 30 c while during the chlorination of dab the concentration of tcm increased from 12 0 to 32 0 Î¼g l when the temperature increased from 10 to 30 c suggesting that increasing the temperature enhanced the formation of tcm previous studies also reported that higher temperature favored the formation of thms hua and reckhow 2008 the formation of dcaa and tcaa from bmaa and dab with different temperatures during chlorination is shown in fig s6c during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of dcaa increased continuously from 18 0 to 39 0 Î¼g l with the increasing temperature from 10 to 30 c while that of tcaa increased from 8 0 to 16 0 Î¼g l similar results were obtained for dab with the concentration of dcaa increasing from 16 0 to 33 0 Î¼g l and that of tcaa increasing from 9 0 to 15 0 Î¼g l the formation of haas increased with the increasing temperature during the chlorination of both bmaa and dab suggesting that higher temperature favored the formation of haas which was in accordance with previous studies demonstrating that increasing the temperature enhanced the formation of haas hua and reckhow 2008 the formation of dcan and tcan from bmaa and dab with different temperatures during chlorination is shown in fig s6d during the chlorination of bmaa the concentration of dcan decreased from 29 0 to 20 0 Î¼g l and that of tcan decreased from 7 0 to 4 0 Î¼g l with the increasing temperature while during the chlorination of dab the concentration of dcan decreased from 38 0 to 32 0 Î¼g l and that of tcan decreased from 19 0 to 13 0 Î¼g l the results indicated that increasing the temperature decreased the formation of hans which might be owing to the enhanced hydrolysis of hans with higher temperatures glezer et al 1999 notably the effect of temperature on the formation of hans was not so significant as that of ph 4 conclusions in this study the decomposition of bmaa and dab during chlorination and the consequent dbps formation were investigated it was found that bmaa and dab were commonly detected in source waters from taihu lake in china and the highest level of bmaa reached 230 8 ng l while the concentrations of dab were generally around 2 0 ng l the decomposition of bmaa and dab both followed pseudo first order decay while the decomposition rate constant of dab was significant higher than that of bmaa thms haas and hans were all generated during the chlorination of bmaa and dab with relatively high yields notably the thms haas and hans yields of each carbon atom from bmaa and dab were significantly higher than that from other organic precursors and the formation of hans from dab was significantly higher than that from bmaa the formation pathways of dbps from bmaa and dab were tentatively proposed and verified through theoretical calculations of note the proposed formation pathways of thms and haas from bmaa were similar to that from dab while the proposed formation pathways of hans from bmaa and dab showed some differences
