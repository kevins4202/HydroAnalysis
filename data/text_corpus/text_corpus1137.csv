5685,evaporative fraction ef which is known to exhibit variation in response to changes in crop species soil and meteorologic conditions plays an important role in interpreting the components of energy budget and estimating evapotranspiration et while such information is scarce for humid rice fields the present study discussed the variation of energy balance components and then examined the pattern of hourly daytime and daily ef after monitoring energy components by eddy covariance for water saving irrigated wsi rice paddies of 2015 and 2016 then the daily et was estimated by an improved ef up scaling method in the subtropical monsoon climate region of east china diurnally hourly ef is deemed as an approximately concave up shape in different growth stages of rice season the seasonal average ef varies gently with a minimum around 10 00 11 00 am seasonally the mean daytime ef for the whole growth stage is 0 86 7 lower than the daily value daily ef exhibits mostly higher than 0 8 except later yellow ripening period approaching 1 0 in the milk stage ef over wsi rice exhibits obviously greater than the reports that from upland crops in addition differences are noted in the results with respect to the daily et estimation by ef up scaling method the estimated daily et etef d from hourly ef during 10 00 11 00 h is highly correlated to the measured et ettrue by the weighed micro lysimeters though the etef d value is underestimated such a considerable gap serves in forming a relationship between etef d and ettrue d that is by simply multiplying the representativeness et value based on the ef up scaling method by a correction procedure calibrated for this region in conclusion an improved ef up scaling method is proposed for extrapolating remote sensing based et estimates to daily values keywords rice evaporative fraction evapotranspiration available energy up scaling method 1 introduction more than 65 chinese population take rice as the staple food however the impact of climate change is intensifying the contradiction between water supply and water consumption in rice field zhang et al 2005 tao et al 2013 yang et al 2014 ling et al 2019 the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river is the largest rice belt in china peng et al 1995 ding et al 2017 wang et al 2017 with about 20 million hm2 planting area of rice accounting for about 50 of the national rice cropping area national bureau of statistics of china 2016 meanwhile the impact assessment with different climate scenarios showed that the solar radiation is gradually decreasing and the availability of available water resources for rice in south china is decreasing tao et al 2013 yang et al 2014 that means climate change will seriously challenge the rice production and food security lv et al 2018 ling et al 2019 in addition although the total water consumption in china has been increasing slowly since 1949 the proportion of agricultural water consumption in total water consumption has been decreasing year by year in 1949 1980 and 2000 the proportion of agricultural water consumption in total water consumption was 97 1 84 3 and 68 8 respectively and decreased to 61 3 by 2011 wang et al 2010 the contradiction between water supply and water consumption the impact of climate change and the challenge of food security are motivating regulators to adopt water saving irrigation wsi practices for rice cultivation belder et al 2004 kato et al 2011 extensive use of wsi is the only choice of agricultural development in china and it is also an important manifestation of the idea of water control water saving priority in china the rice wsi practices applied more than 16 7 million ha in some provinces in china jiangsu zhejiang anhui jiangxi heilongjiang jilin etc more than 50 percent of the china s rice fields peng and xu 2012 meanwhile the widespread implementation of wsi has led to drying wetting cycles which results in the changes in the energy interception and partition soil moisture and crop growth as well as heat and vapor flux transfer within the rice canopy gao et al 2003 castellvi et al 2006 linquist et al 2015 water management based on crop water requirements is the fundamental requirement and central mission in regional agriculture which can be detected by the accurate calculation of crop evapotranspiration et li et al 2008 de oliveira et al 2009 bezerra et al 2015 et is a key process in the hydrological cycle and a key linkage between underlying surface and near surface turbulence dynamics which shows great temporal and spatial variability because of complex interactions between soil vegetation and climate allen et al 2007 kalma et al 2008 wang and dickinson 2012 hao 2016 jiang et al 2016 extensive use of wsi will change et thus it is very important if we knew and accurately estimate et the crop et has been estimated from several methodologies such as water balance malek and bingham 1993 choudhury et al 2013 lysimeter tyagi et al 2000 anapalli et al 2016 and micrometeorological methods like eddy covariance hossen et al 2012 yang et al 2016 and bowen ratio energy balance zhang et al 2010 escarabajal henarejos et al 2015 however these methods required heavy workloads or many expensive investments for large regions and long term observation assume homogeneous vegetation cover and structure li et al 2012 which makes accurate daily et estimation at the regional and global scales a challenge remote sensing without these problems can cope with the spatial variability of surface characteristics which is ideal for deriving spatially continuous fields of instantaneous et data using energy balance components at the regional scale verstraeten et al 2005 allen et al 2007 chowdary et al 2009 then the data are often used in the prediction of daily et irrigation scheduling water resources planning water regulation and are essential components of general hydrologic and soil moisture models in practice any attempt to improve the efficiency of agricultural water management and examine the water and energy balance transmission should be based on reliable estimates of daily et delogu et al 2012 liu et al 2017 that is to say instantaneous et are relatively unimportant unless they can be used to predict daily et thus methods for daily et extrapolation from instantaneous observations using remote sensing are needed which may be an effective approach to resolve the problems that remote sensing only provides essentially instantaneous estimates of et and the upscaling relationship should be investigated and demonstrated by studies that used primarily local in situ observations upscaling hourly et to daily et based on remote sensing data is the most popular method to estimate regional daily et several methods including evaporative fraction ef method crop coefficient method canopy resistance method katerji perrier advectio aridity method and daily sine function can be used for the estimation of daily et based on the assumption that the diurnal course of et is similar to that of solar irradiance shuttleworth et al 1989 malek et al 1992 zhang and lemeur 1995 colaizzi et al 2006 allen et al 2007 hoedjes et al 2008 han et al 2011 chen et al 2013 chen et al 2013 the evaporative fraction ef defined as the ratio between latent heat flux and available energy at the land surface is an important parameter reflecting the distribution of surface available energy and interpreting the components of energy budget it can be derived based the micrometeorological data in conjunction with remotely sensed measurements to determine et the ef method is one of the most popular schemes for temporal upscaling the effectiveness of the ef method has been investigated by numerous studies that used local available energy observations and assumed that ef was relatively constant during the daytime jackson et al 1983 shuttleworth et al 1989 brutsaert and sugita 1992 kustas et al 1993 sobrino et al 2007 ryu et al 2012 tang et al 2017 additional studies have done to incorporate a variable daytime ef in the upscaling of instantaneous et data in practice the ef over the course of a daytime is essentially time dependent and can be highly depends on soil moisture availability canopy cover fraction stages of development relative humidity as well as the biological characteristics of vegetation in an area dirmeyer et al 1999 wever et al 2002 gentine et al 2007 chávez et al 2009 hoedjes et al 2008 whereas the surface energy budget affects the microclimate of the vegetation canopy hossen et al 2012 thus there is moreover no consensus on the general trend of daytime ef fluctuations which can vary for a given location van niel et al 2011 gentine et al 2007 investigated that the self preservation of daytime ef should be revised and a concave up shape of ef was obtained with more representative hoedjes et al 2008 underlined that the daytime ef remained fairly constant under dry conditions while followed a concave up shape under wet conditions allen et al 2007 presented that the hourly ef observed for the clipped grass showed continuing decline while showed pronounced rise for sugar beets in the afternoon selecting the most representative hourly ef properly is essential in estimating daily et by upscaling the instant result by remote sensing since ef varied greatly in the daytime yet the time with the most representative varied among sites and underlying surface most studies suggested that ef around noon or the daily average performed acceptable sugita and brutsaert 1991 brutsaert and sugita 1992 kustas et al 1994 shuttleworth et al 1989 chávez et al 2009 yet some studies shown that non noon moments are more representative stewart et al 1996 li et al 2008 but a considerable gap between the estimated either based on noon time or non noon hourly ef and measured daily et always exists for ef around noon it was found underestimate daytime et by 5 10 compared with the measurements by bowen ratio sugita and brutsaert 1991 or with an underestimation 0 3 mm day 1 for corn et by eddy covariance energy balance systems chávez et al 2009 it also underestimated daily et by 8 compared to the daytime average ef kustas et al 1994 when it comes to non noon ef li et al 2008 demonstrated the daytime et estimated by ef during 14 00 15 00 h was highly correlated to the measured et but a considerable underestimation still existed previous studies on ef upscaling method involved several vegetation land surfaces yet information regarding the components of energy budget and the diurnal pattern of ef in wsi rice fields as well as its application for rice et estimation remains unclear moreover if the method developed in other land surfaces performed well or not in wsi rice field should be investigated as well as the most representative time in hourly ef selection this study therefore aims to 1 analyze diurnal pattern of hourly ef and seasonal variation of daily or daytime average ef over wsi rice based on measurement by eddy covariance energy balance systems 2 investigate the representativeness of time of day ef in estimating daily et which enable accurate prediction of regional et for wsi rice in the yangtze basin the results will facilitate the application of the proposed ef upscaling procedure in agriculture and hydrology for estimating daily et at regional scale over wsi rice field from remote sensing data 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site is a paddy field at the kunshan irrigation

cultivated from early summer june 27th 2015 and july 1st 2016 to middle autumn october 25th 2015 and november 3rd 2016 the paddy soil was non flooded during most of the growth season which was irrigated when the soil moisture approaches the low thresholds according to the local water saving irrigation wsi practice controlled irrigation either inside the lysimeters or in open rice fields surrounded the low thresholds for controlled irrigation is slightly different among various growth stages as reported by xu et al 2012 the detailed records of irrigation events are listed in table 1 and the corresponding wetting drying cycles in wsi field in 2015 and 2016 rice season was shown in fig 1 relative soil moisture content θr as the ratio of θ to θs and ponding water depth δd were used to describe the field water condition fertilizers and pesticides were applied to the wsi rice field according to the local farmer s practice 2 2 field measurement field measurements were conducted during rice seasons in 2015 and 2016 rice is the unique crop in the station short and consistent it provides a sufficient upwind fetch of uniform land cover for measuring energy fluxes using an open path eddy covariance ec systems the ec system which was aligned perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction southeast direction was composed of a csat3a sonic anemometer campbell scientific inc usa and an ec150 open path infrared gas analyzer campbell scientific inc usa operating at a frequency of 10 hz both at 2 5 m above the soil surface three weighed micro lysimeters were installed in the wsi rice field aligned with the ec system in the northwest direction and used to measure hourly et etml based on the mass change at canopy scale two of the three micro lysimeters were used to calculate etml and one was used for load cell calibration each of the micro lysimeters used for mass balance calculation was composed of an inner cylinder an outer cylinder weighing system data recording system and draining apparatus the inner cylinders were planted with rice each lysimeter received four rice plants and the cultivation practices including fertilizer and pesticides application were applied to the micro lysimeters as the same with surrounding fields the inner cylinder was replaced by an object with a fixed weight of 143 kg in the micro lysimeter used for load cell calibration the configuration location and measurement of the lysimeters were described in liu et al 2018 in more detail an automatic micro meteorological measurement system ws std1 delta t uk together with ec system

gs volumetric soil moisture content θ and soil temperature ts were measured at 0 10 m 0 20 m and 0 30 m continuously to ensure the quality and integrity of meteorological data the seasonal variation of vpd was provided in fig 2 which was a climatic indicator affected the water and heat exchange simultaneously to trigger the irrigation soil moistures in 0 20 cm soil θ were measured daily when soil was non flooding at 8 00 a m using a time domain reflectometry tdr trase system soil moisture equipment usa and waveguides buried at this depth canopy height hc and leaf area index lai were measured manually every five days and for the days between measurements were determined by linear interpolation fig 3 2 3 data processing and quality control of ec measurements for the data quality control of the ec measurement raw data 10 hz were processed by edire and necessary corrections e g coordinate rotation via 2d rotation sonic virtual temperature conversion for sensible heat flux density fluctuation correction for latent heat flux spectral loss correction and spike detection were implemented following the procedure outlined in literatures anthoni et al 2004 mauder et al 2006 ueyama et al 2012 masseroni et al 2013 flux data were averaged every 30 min blocks the source area was estimated through the same approach as taken by kljun et al 2004 and aubinet et al 2012 which originated within a distance of 100 120 m upwind of the ec stations masseroni et al 2012 the flux data were filtered when the friction velocity u was lower than the threshold of 0 1 m s 1 anthoni et al 2004 finally the missing data accounting for approximately 22 of the entire rice season from 2015 to 2016 were determined by linear interpolation for gap within 3 h or by a mean diurnal average method within a 10 day window for long data gaps falge et al 2001 2 4 surface energy balance the energy balance of a terrestrial surface is expressed as hossen et al 2012 1 rn g 0 s l e h s where rn g0 s le and hs represent the net radiation surface soil heat flux storage energy in the biomass latent heat flux and sensible heat flux respectively units w m 2 calorimetric method the most popular approach that combines the soil heat flux plate approach and calorimetry was followed to calculate g0 term in current research g 0 was calculated as the sum of soil heat flux at a depth of 8 cm gs change in energy storage q in the 8 cm soil layer above and change in energy storage in the flooding water gw heusinkveld et al 2004 which can be expressed as 2 g 0 q g s g w assuming that the soil was mostly non flooded in water saving irrigation paddy field gw is neglected the q can be determined based on the change in soil temperature meyers and hollinger 2004 heitman et al 2010 3 q δ t c s d δ t where δt is the change in soil temperature c cs is the heat capacity of the moist soil j g 1 k 1 d is the soil thickness cm and δt is the time step δt 30 min the air heat capacity is small compared with those of soil and water and the volume fraction of soil organic matter is negligible thus cs for moist mineral soils was simplified as masseroni et al 2014 kustas and daughtry 1990 4 c s ρ b c d θ v ρ

of a dry mineral soil which is 840 j kg 1 k 1 hanks and ashcroft 1980 in addition s deduced from a concentration profile method inside the canopy papale et al 2006 leuning et al 2012 was low and ignorable mostly fell in the range of 10 to 10 w m 2 and accounted for less than 2 of the available energy during the rice cultivation season to evaluate surface energy balance closure daily energy balance ratio ebr calculated by using the corrected fluxes were average as 0 93 and 0 85 in 2015 and 2016 rice seasons respectively higher than that reported by studies at fluxnet sites baldocchi et al 2001 wilson et al 2002 the energy balance deficit problem was entirely related to the underestimation of sensible and latent heat fluxes as indicated in literatures wilson et al 2002 foken 2008 foken et al 2011 and the energy gap could be closed through the evaporative fraction method gebler et al 2014 2 5 evaporation fraction and enforcing energy balance closure evaporation fraction ef is defined as the ratio of latent heat flux to available energy rn g0 shuttleworth et al 1989 nutini et al 2014 5 ef l e r n g 0 using eq 5 ef can be calculated at either an hourly scale or at a daily scale on this basis the energy gap can be closed by distributing the energy balance deficit ebd calculated as rn g0 le hs to the sensible and latent heat fluxes according to the ef closure method which consists of three steps as introduced by kessomkiat et al 2013 and gebler et al 2014 2 6 measured and estimated et rice et were measured independently by the weighed micro lysimeters etml and ec system etec for canopy and field scales in current study in our previous work slight difference was found in magnitude and phase between etml and etec because of the spatial scale effect liu et al 2018 the relationship between measured etml and etec values was proposed thus the field scale et could be calculated by the measured et at canopy scale according to the relationship termed as ettrue in current research ef in different periods of daytime 7 00 8 00 8 00 9 00 9 00 10 00 10 00 11 00 11 00 12 00 12 00 13 00 13 00 14 00 14 00 15 00 and 15 00 16 00 gmt 8 were calculated using eq 5 based on available energy measurement during the corresponding periods then the daily et etef d was estimated based on daily available energy and hourly ef by eq 6 sugita and brutsaert 1991 6 et ef d 86400 e f λ d r n g 0 d where etef d is the hourly to daily up scaling et estimation through the evaporation fraction method mm day 1 λ is the latent flux of heat mj kg 1 λ 2 501 2 361 10 3 ta ta is the average daily temperature c the subscripts d indicates the average daily 24 h value taken daily ef as standard value the ef in different time intervals 7 00 8 00 8 00 9 00 15 00 16 00 h were used instead of daily ef to calculate daily etef d using eq 6 it should be noted that etef d or ettrue d is daily rather than daytime et because rn g0 d is calculated for 24 hours if the daytime et needs to be calculated rn g0 should be the value during daylight period in eq 6 with ettrue calculated by the measured etml as standard value daily et value estimated from different hour of day ef etef were evaluated by calculating the linear regression slope coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and index of agreement ioa the r2 rmse and ioa were calculated as the following equations 7 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 8 rmse i 1 n p i q i 2 n 9 ioa 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 where pi and oi are the estimated and measured values respectively p and o are the mean estimated and measured values respectively and n is the number of samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 mean diurnal variation of energy budget components in different rice phenological stages the stage average energy balance components rn g0 le and hs varied in a unimodal shape in each of rice phenological stages fig 4 usually the value of le was largely affected by rn g0 and the curve of its diurnal variation was basically the same as rn g0 compared with hs the diurnal variation amplitude of le was much greater the le flux was the main consumer of the external drive energy hence the estimation of et water in millimeter equivalent to le is the most important process in determining the exchanges of energy and mass in a paddy field in addition the proportion of le to available energy was relatively low in the yellow ripening stage less than 80 per cents reasons might be related to the decreased transpiration rate of rice in the non vigorous growth stage as well as to the lower soil moisture condition during yellow ripening stage without irrigation notably rn g0 decreased suddenly and abruptly during the transition periods from daytime to nighttime resulting in big gap between le and rn g0 with rn g0 0 and le 0 this phenomenon can be ascribed to the difference in variation phase of rn and g0 during the same periods during daytime to nighttime transition rn decreased rapidly from positive to negative however the transmission of energy from the air to the soil heat flux plate through a thickness of soil was not an instantaneous process some time being necessary for the heat flux plate to response to the energy change poblete echeverría et al 2014 thus the decrease in g0 lagged behind rn led to the uncertainly negative energy rn g0 in this period 3 2 mean diurnal variation of ef in the different rice growth stages because rn g0 is close to zero in the nighttime and is uncertain value during the transition periods from daytime to nighttime the hourly ef is easy to fluctuate abruptly thus only estimated ef during the daytime from 7 00 to 16 00 h is included diurnal variation of ef and their error bars of the rice in the different growth stages of 2015 and 2016 re greening early tillering middle tillering later tillering jointing and booting heading to flowering milk and yellow ripening stage are shown in fig 5 ef exhibits an approximately concave up shape with a minimum at noon 10 00 11 00 11 00 12 00 or 12 00 13 00 in different growth stages of rice season but it fluctuates occasionally which are probably caused by cloud rainy events and other non fair weather conditions hence when weather conditions are variable the hypothesis of constant ef during the daytime may not be satisfied and the procedure may result in considerable error lhomme and elguero 1999 gentine et al 2007 chávez et al 2009 near sunrise and sunset hourly ef increase sharply in most growth stages available energy that appears in the denominator of ef is small near these times gentine et al 2007 the error bars of ef varied dramatically especially during the growth period with lower rn g0 energy flux see figs 4 and 5 there is no significant difference in ef among different growth stages except in yellow ripening during yellow ripening the lowest ef occurs with average ef about 0 79 due to lower available energy canopy coverage and soil moisture on that stage fig 5 also shows the mean diurnal cycle of hourly ef averaged over the whole rice growth days red line in bold the hourly ef exhibits a typical concave up shape with a gentle variation during 10 00 14 00 period and a minimum around 10 00 11 00 am therefore the hourly ef during 10 00 14 00 period may lead to less error in daily evapotranspiration estimation 3 3 seasonal variation in daily or daytime ef seasonal variation of daily or daytime ef and the events of precipitation and irrigation in the whole wsi rice growing season in 2015 and 2016 are shown in fig 6 in 2015 the daily ef in the re greening stage approximately stabilizes at 0 88 the daily ef increases gradually reaching their respective maximum 1 0 in the late tillering stage and then decreases along with time to milk maturity mostly higher than 0 9 during the milk period the daily ef reaches another peak then daily ef in the yellow ripening stage significantly reduces to about 0 8 and the mean ef for the whole growth season is 0 92 in 2016 the daily ef in the re greening stage varies less remarkably and then increases gradually it reaches 1 0 in several days of milk stage and then drops sharply along with the decrease of soil moisture also falls below 0 8 the mean daily ef for the whole growth season is 0 92 the difference in seasonal variation of daily ef between 2015 and 2016 is ascribed to the rice phenological traits influenced by meteorological condition liu et al 2018 additionally the ef values in current study are obviously greater than the reports that from upland crops e g wheat vines cotton and so on gentine et al 2007 li et al 2008 bezerra et al 2015 bagley et al 2017 which is ascribed to the moist soil water environment and the subtropical monsoon climate the soil moisture content of paddy field is wetter than dryland even if it is under the water saving irrigation practice meanwhile the larger vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation in subtropical monsoon climate make latent heat flux an absolute major energy consumption item they are also greater than the result of kar and kumar 2016 who reported that the daily ef was 79 82 in different cultivars cv lalat and gayatri and two rainfed rice seasons of 2008 and 2009 for the boro rice transplanted on 29 january and the aman rice transplanted on 20 august periods ef were 0 71 and 0 74 on seasonal average respectively reported by hossen et al 2012 the daytime defined as the time between 7 00 16 00 of a day ef values are also shown in fig 6 the daytime ef fluctuates obviously with the daily ef during the rice growth stage suddenly and abruptly increasing after every irrigation or heavy rain for example rainfall on 22 october 113 days after transplantation in 2016 increased ef from 0 72 to 0 92 and irrigation on 5 july ninth day after transplantation in 2015 increased ef from 0 77 to 0 86 the results agree with kustas et al 1993 and li et al 2008 although the climatic conditions and crop species are different in this study the wsi rice field is located in the subtropical monsoon climate region with the specific wetting drying cycle of soil condition thus the energy partition will tend to increase et water in millimeter equivalent to le in energy balance after the rapid increase of soil water content as resulted from irrigation and precipitation in addition the mean daytime ef for the whole growth stage of 2015 and 2016 are almost the same about 0 86 lower than the daily values since the assumption of ef variation is not satisfied during nighttime actually this difference term regardless of nocturnal energy distribution and the contribution of night et can be as large as 7 many papers discussed the contribution of nighttime et like tolk et al 2006 who reported the nighttime et was 3 over a cotton season for a dryland 7 2 for an irrigated alfalfa crop and as much as 12 in the semi arid high plains sugita and brutsaert 1991 and chávez et al 2009 emphasized that a 24 h period should be considered in daily et estimation by extrapolating instantaneous values since nighttime et may not be negligible notable a comparison of the variation of daily vs daytime ef values shows the latter value varies greatly and abruptly in both years possible as results of the temporal scale difference in daily and daytime ef calculation the energy transfer including le is a continuous process the energy stored in the soil canopy air and biomass in the daytime is partly released at night therefore the sum of le and hs is larger than the available energy during nighttime as the result of the energy balance of nighttime and daytime errors as well as the great difference in climate and soil moisture condition in the daytime the result in ef calculation is more suddenly and abruptly at daytime scale than daily scale 3 4 time of day representativeness of ef in estimating daily et daily estimated rice et termed as etef d was predicted by eq 6 with daily available energy data and hourly ef at different daytime hours performance of etef d calculation against the measured ettrue d in 2015 and 2016 rice seasons are shown in fig 7 for etef d estimated based on hourly ef at the specific local time from 07 00 to 16 00 the regression slope between etef d and etture d is always less than 1 0 both in 2015 and 2016 reaching the minimum at noon and then increase correspondingly etef d calculated based on ef at different hours underestimate the true value ettrue d 3 835 and 3 816 mm day 1 in 2015 and 2016 respectively the error of the estimated etef d is great when it is calculated with hourly ef at sunset or sunrise period fig 7 the correlations between etef d and ettrue d are much better during 10 00 11 00 with higher r2 of 0 983 and 0 987 higher ioa of 0 993 and 0 996 and lower rmse of 0 291 and 0 221 mm day 1 in 2015 and 2016 respectively although underestimation is non ignorable a meaningful question is if there is a time of day when ef is most representative or has the best performance in et estimation this is an important issue in et estimation by remote sensing with ef method based on instantaneous observations however it seems difficult to give a universal best hour of measurements valid for different sites because the choice of hour will depend on the crop species soil and canopy surface and meteorological conditions of the study site in general the estimation of ef around noon would be representative of the daily average and is preferred to be used for et up scaling from hourly to daily shuttleworth et al 1989 crago 1996 colaizzi et al 2006 chávez et al 2009 in our case the regression slope between etef d and etture d was never greater than 1 0 the value of the ef taken around midday is smaller than the daytime average this may lead to underestimation of daytime et in addition during the night the ef shows large variations and is highly unstable this means using the ef up scaling method results in an underestimation of daily et over wsi rice field with any one time of day ef value and a modification is worth exploring results for performance of etef based on 10 00 11 00 periods compared with the etture and the corresponding available energy rn g0 during the rice growth stage are reported in fig 8 in both rice seasons seasonal simulated etef and the measured ettrue varied in a consistent pattern but different from other regions as a result of difference in magnitude and process of rn g0 several researches indicated that rice et generally got the maximum in the heading to flowering stage with the maximum lai tyagi et al 2000 timm et al 2014 for example rice et reached maximum of 7 mm day 1 when lai was at its peak flowering stage and decreased with decrease of lai in maturation stage reported by timm et al 2014 the similar phenomenon was reported in japan tyagi et al 2000 and in california hatala et al 2012 while in current study both etture and etef reached the maximum in the late 2015 and middle 2016 tillering stage and then decreased along with the crop growth in late season the difference in seasonal variation of rice et among different years and other regions are ascribed to the rice phenological traits liu et al 2018 for early rice which transplanted in spring or early summer the vigorous growth stage coincides with the period in july or august with highest solar radiation for later rice which mostly transplanted in later summer the vigorous growth stage occurs in september when the temperature and radiation are lower than in july or august as a result et largely affected by rn is generally larger in late july or early august middle and late tillering stages for later rice furthermore the results depicted in fig 8 also confirm that etef and etture frequently has a considerable gap an underestimation of 15 6 and 13 4 on average for 2015 and 2016 seasonal ettrue respectively such a stable and considerable gap bring forward a demand in forming a rational relationship between the etef d calculated by the best time of day representativeness 10 00 11 00 of ef and effective daily etture d in current research for practical purposes correction procedure proposed should be simple considering vapor pressure deficit vpd is the key factor affecting et especially at night li et al 2008 ding et al 2010 it is used to set up the correction procedure by eureqa software v 0 83 data in 2015 and 2016 rice season were used for calibration and validation of the proposed et correction procedure and correlation was as follows 10 et sim d a et ef d b vpd d where etsim d is the simulated daily et with the correction procedure etef d is the estimated daily et by up scaling using ef during10 00 11 00 period vpdd is the daily mean vapor pressure deficit kpa and a and b are the locally calibrated constant this attempt is illustrated in fig 9 in which etsim d is modified with a 1 and b 0 5 respectively based on the calibration dataset the result for validation is satisfactory with a high correlation coefficient of 1 027 lower rmse of 0 205 mm day 1 much better than that without correction r2 and ioa are 0 987 and 0 996 for validation dataset both very close to 1 0 and the same as results without correction in summary the result confirms that the proposed procedure can be useful for practical purposes specially even if the time of satellite overpass is not consistent with the best time of day representativeness of ef in estimating daily et the relationship between them can be established according to the diurnal variation of hourly ef in advance 4 conclusions this study is aimed at analyzing and providing insights into the diurnal and seasonal behavior of ef and its time of day representativeness in estimating daily et variation of energy budget components was used to explain the exchanges of energy and the patterns observed in ef in the wsi paddy field diurnal variation of ef exhibits an approximately concave up shape in different growth stages of rice season and the mean diurnal cycle exhibits a typical concave up shape with a gentle variation during 10 00 14 00 period and a minimum around 10 00 11 00 am seasonally the range of daily ef is mostly higher than 0 8 except in later yellow ripening period with an average of 0 92 which is obviously greater than the reports that from upland crops the result in ef calculation varied more suddenly and abruptly at daytime scale than daily scale the mean daytime ef for the whole growth stage is 0 86 7 lower than the daily values a comparison of estimated etef d based on hourly ef with the measured ettrue d reveals that the regression slope is mostly lower than 1 0 the correlation between etef d estimated with the best time of day 10 00 11 00 representativeness of ef and ettrue d is quite high r2 of 0 983 and 0 987 ioa of 0 993 and 0 996 the underestimation can be as large as 15 6 and 13 4 on average for 2015 and 2016 respectively then a correction procedure is proposed by simply incorporating variable of vpd to form a liner regression equation with et value following the ef up scaling method as independent variable it resulted in satisfactory result for daily et estimation by an improved ef up scaling method it will provide a scientific basis and a useful tool for accurately estimating daily

5685,evaporative fraction ef which is known to exhibit variation in response to changes in crop species soil and meteorologic conditions plays an important role in interpreting the components of energy budget and estimating evapotranspiration et while such information is scarce for humid rice fields the present study discussed the variation of energy balance components and then examined the pattern of hourly daytime and daily ef after monitoring energy components by eddy covariance for water saving irrigated wsi rice paddies of 2015 and 2016 then the daily et was estimated by an improved ef up scaling method in the subtropical monsoon climate region of east china diurnally hourly ef is deemed as an approximately concave up shape in different growth stages of rice season the seasonal average ef varies gently with a minimum around 10 00 11 00 am seasonally the mean daytime ef for the whole growth stage is 0 86 7 lower than the daily value daily ef exhibits mostly higher than 0 8 except later yellow ripening period approaching 1 0 in the milk stage ef over wsi rice exhibits obviously greater than the reports that from upland crops in addition differences are noted in the results with respect to the daily et estimation by ef up scaling method the estimated daily et etef d from hourly ef during 10 00 11 00 h is highly correlated to the measured et ettrue by the weighed micro lysimeters though the etef d value is underestimated such a considerable gap serves in forming a relationship between etef d and ettrue d that is by simply multiplying the representativeness et value based on the ef up scaling method by a correction procedure calibrated for this region in conclusion an improved ef up scaling method is proposed for extrapolating remote sensing based et estimates to daily values keywords rice evaporative fraction evapotranspiration available energy up scaling method 1 introduction more than 65 chinese population take rice as the staple food however the impact of climate change is intensifying the contradiction between water supply and water consumption in rice field zhang et al 2005 tao et al 2013 yang et al 2014 ling et al 2019 the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river is the largest rice belt in china peng et al 1995 ding et al 2017 wang et al 2017 with about 20 million hm2 planting area of rice accounting for about 50 of the national rice cropping area national bureau of statistics of china 2016 meanwhile the impact assessment with different climate scenarios showed that the solar radiation is gradually decreasing and the availability of available water resources for rice in south china is decreasing tao et al 2013 yang et al 2014 that means climate change will seriously challenge the rice production and food security lv et al 2018 ling et al 2019 in addition although the total water consumption in china has been increasing slowly since 1949 the proportion of agricultural water consumption in total water consumption has been decreasing year by year in 1949 1980 and 2000 the proportion of agricultural water consumption in total water consumption was 97 1 84 3 and 68 8 respectively and decreased to 61 3 by 2011 wang et al 2010 the contradiction between water supply and water consumption the impact of climate change and the challenge of food security are motivating regulators to adopt water saving irrigation wsi practices for rice cultivation belder et al 2004 kato et al 2011 extensive use of wsi is the only choice of agricultural development in china and it is also an important manifestation of the idea of water control water saving priority in china the rice wsi practices applied more than 16 7 million ha in some provinces in china jiangsu zhejiang anhui jiangxi heilongjiang jilin etc more than 50 percent of the china s rice fields peng and xu 2012 meanwhile the widespread implementation of wsi has led to drying wetting cycles which results in the changes in the energy interception and partition soil moisture and crop growth as well as heat and vapor flux transfer within the rice canopy gao et al 2003 castellvi et al 2006 linquist et al 2015 water management based on crop water requirements is the fundamental requirement and central mission in regional agriculture which can be detected by the accurate calculation of crop evapotranspiration et li et al 2008 de oliveira et al 2009 bezerra et al 2015 et is a key process in the hydrological cycle and a key linkage between underlying surface and near surface turbulence dynamics which shows great temporal and spatial variability because of complex interactions between soil vegetation and climate allen et al 2007 kalma et al 2008 wang and dickinson 2012 hao 2016 jiang et al 2016 extensive use of wsi will change et thus it is very important if we knew and accurately estimate et the crop et has been estimated from several methodologies such as water balance malek and bingham 1993 choudhury et al 2013 lysimeter tyagi et al 2000 anapalli et al 2016 and micrometeorological methods like eddy covariance hossen et al 2012 yang et al 2016 and bowen ratio energy balance zhang et al 2010 escarabajal henarejos et al 2015 however these methods required heavy workloads or many expensive investments for large regions and long term observation assume homogeneous vegetation cover and structure li et al 2012 which makes accurate daily et estimation at the regional and global scales a challenge remote sensing without these problems can cope with the spatial variability of surface characteristics which is ideal for deriving spatially continuous fields of instantaneous et data using energy balance components at the regional scale verstraeten et al 2005 allen et al 2007 chowdary et al 2009 then the data are often used in the prediction of daily et irrigation scheduling water resources planning water regulation and are essential components of general hydrologic and soil moisture models in practice any attempt to improve the efficiency of agricultural water management and examine the water and energy balance transmission should be based on reliable estimates of daily et delogu et al 2012 liu et al 2017 that is to say instantaneous et are relatively unimportant unless they can be used to predict daily et thus methods for daily et extrapolation from instantaneous observations using remote sensing are needed which may be an effective approach to resolve the problems that remote sensing only provides essentially instantaneous estimates of et and the upscaling relationship should be investigated and demonstrated by studies that used primarily local in situ observations upscaling hourly et to daily et based on remote sensing data is the most popular method to estimate regional daily et several methods including evaporative fraction ef method crop coefficient method canopy resistance method katerji perrier advectio aridity method and daily sine function can be used for the estimation of daily et based on the assumption that the diurnal course of et is similar to that of solar irradiance shuttleworth et al 1989 malek et al 1992 zhang and lemeur 1995 colaizzi et al 2006 allen et al 2007 hoedjes et al 2008 han et al 2011 chen et al 2013 chen et al 2013 the evaporative fraction ef defined as the ratio between latent heat flux and available energy at the land surface is an important parameter reflecting the distribution of surface available energy and interpreting the components of energy budget it can be derived based the micrometeorological data in conjunction with remotely sensed measurements to determine et the ef method is one of the most popular schemes for temporal upscaling the effectiveness of the ef method has been investigated by numerous studies that used local available energy observations and assumed that ef was relatively constant during the daytime jackson et al 1983 shuttleworth et al 1989 brutsaert and sugita 1992 kustas et al 1993 sobrino et al 2007 ryu et al 2012 tang et al 2017 additional studies have done to incorporate a variable daytime ef in the upscaling of instantaneous et data in practice the ef over the course of a daytime is essentially time dependent and can be highly depends on soil moisture availability canopy cover fraction stages of development relative humidity as well as the biological characteristics of vegetation in an area dirmeyer et al 1999 wever et al 2002 gentine et al 2007 chávez et al 2009 hoedjes et al 2008 whereas the surface energy budget affects the microclimate of the vegetation canopy hossen et al 2012 thus there is moreover no consensus on the general trend of daytime ef fluctuations which can vary for a given location van niel et al 2011 gentine et al 2007 investigated that the self preservation of daytime ef should be revised and a concave up shape of ef was obtained with more representative hoedjes et al 2008 underlined that the daytime ef remained fairly constant under dry conditions while followed a concave up shape under wet conditions allen et al 2007 presented that the hourly ef observed for the clipped grass showed continuing decline while showed pronounced rise for sugar beets in the afternoon selecting the most representative hourly ef properly is essential in estimating daily et by upscaling the instant result by remote sensing since ef varied greatly in the daytime yet the time with the most representative varied among sites and underlying surface most studies suggested that ef around noon or the daily average performed acceptable sugita and brutsaert 1991 brutsaert and sugita 1992 kustas et al 1994 shuttleworth et al 1989 chávez et al 2009 yet some studies shown that non noon moments are more representative stewart et al 1996 li et al 2008 but a considerable gap between the estimated either based on noon time or non noon hourly ef and measured daily et always exists for ef around noon it was found underestimate daytime et by 5 10 compared with the measurements by bowen ratio sugita and brutsaert 1991 or with an underestimation 0 3 mm day 1 for corn et by eddy covariance energy balance systems chávez et al 2009 it also underestimated daily et by 8 compared to the daytime average ef kustas et al 1994 when it comes to non noon ef li et al 2008 demonstrated the daytime et estimated by ef during 14 00 15 00 h was highly correlated to the measured et but a considerable underestimation still existed previous studies on ef upscaling method involved several vegetation land surfaces yet information regarding the components of energy budget and the diurnal pattern of ef in wsi rice fields as well as its application for rice et estimation remains unclear moreover if the method developed in other land surfaces performed well or not in wsi rice field should be investigated as well as the most representative time in hourly ef selection this study therefore aims to 1 analyze diurnal pattern of hourly ef and seasonal variation of daily or daytime average ef over wsi rice based on measurement by eddy covariance energy balance systems 2 investigate the representativeness of time of day ef in estimating daily et which enable accurate prediction of regional et for wsi rice in the yangtze basin the results will facilitate the application of the proposed ef upscaling procedure in agriculture and hydrology for estimating daily et at regional scale over wsi rice field from remote sensing data 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site is a paddy field at the kunshan irrigation

cultivated from early summer june 27th 2015 and july 1st 2016 to middle autumn october 25th 2015 and november 3rd 2016 the paddy soil was non flooded during most of the growth season which was irrigated when the soil moisture approaches the low thresholds according to the local water saving irrigation wsi practice controlled irrigation either inside the lysimeters or in open rice fields surrounded the low thresholds for controlled irrigation is slightly different among various growth stages as reported by xu et al 2012 the detailed records of irrigation events are listed in table 1 and the corresponding wetting drying cycles in wsi field in 2015 and 2016 rice season was shown in fig 1 relative soil moisture content θr as the ratio of θ to θs and ponding water depth δd were used to describe the field water condition fertilizers and pesticides were applied to the wsi rice field according to the local farmer s practice 2 2 field measurement field measurements were conducted during rice seasons in 2015 and 2016 rice is the unique crop in the station short and consistent it provides a sufficient upwind fetch of uniform land cover for measuring energy fluxes using an open path eddy covariance ec systems the ec system which was aligned perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction southeast direction was composed of a csat3a sonic anemometer campbell scientific inc usa and an ec150 open path infrared gas analyzer campbell scientific inc usa operating at a frequency of 10 hz both at 2 5 m above the soil surface three weighed micro lysimeters were installed in the wsi rice field aligned with the ec system in the northwest direction and used to measure hourly et etml based on the mass change at canopy scale two of the three micro lysimeters were used to calculate etml and one was used for load cell calibration each of the micro lysimeters used for mass balance calculation was composed of an inner cylinder an outer cylinder weighing system data recording system and draining apparatus the inner cylinders were planted with rice each lysimeter received four rice plants and the cultivation practices including fertilizer and pesticides application were applied to the micro lysimeters as the same with surrounding fields the inner cylinder was replaced by an object with a fixed weight of 143 kg in the micro lysimeter used for load cell calibration the configuration location and measurement of the lysimeters were described in liu et al 2018 in more detail an automatic micro meteorological measurement system ws std1 delta t uk together with ec system

manually every five days and for the days between measurements were determined by linear interpolation fig 3 2 3 data processing and quality control of ec measurements for the data quality control of the ec measurement raw data 10 hz were processed by edire and necessary corrections e g coordinate rotation via 2d rotation sonic virtual temperature conversion for sensible heat flux density fluctuation correction for latent heat flux spectral loss correction and spike detection were implemented following the procedure outlined in literatures anthoni et al 2004 mauder et al 2006 ueyama et al 2012 masseroni et al 2013 flux data were averaged every 30 min blocks the source area was estimated through the same approach as taken by kljun et al 2004 and aubinet et al 2012 which originated within a distance of 100 120 m upwind of the ec stations masseroni et al 2012 the flux data were filtered when the friction velocity u was lower than the threshold of 0 1 m s 1 anthoni et al 2004 finally the missing data accounting for approximately 22 of the entire rice season from 2015 to 2016 were determined by linear interpolation for gap within 3 h or by a mean diurnal average method within a 10 day window for long data gaps falge et al 2001 2 4 surface energy balance the energy balance of a terrestrial surface is expressed as hossen et al 2012 1 rn g 0 s l e h s where rn g0 s le and hs represent the net radiation surface soil heat flux storage energy in the biomass latent heat flux and sensible heat flux respectively units w m 2 calorimetric method the most popular approach that combines the soil heat flux plate approach and calorimetry was followed to calculate g0 term in current research g 0 was calculated as the sum of soil heat flux at a depth of 8 cm gs change in energy storage q in the 8 cm soil layer above and change in energy storage in the flooding water gw heusinkveld et al 2004 which can be expressed as 2 g 0 q g s g w assuming that the soil was mostly non flooded in water saving irrigation paddy field gw is neglected the q can be determined based on the change in soil temperature meyers and hollinger 2004 heitman et al 2010 3 q δ t c s d δ t where δt is the change in soil temperature c cs is the heat capacity of the moist soil j g 1 k 1 d is the soil thickness cm and δt is the time step δt 30 min the air heat capacity is small compared with those of soil and water and the volume fraction of soil organic matter is negligible thus cs for moist mineral soils was simplified as masseroni et al 2014 kustas and daughtry 1990 4 c s ρ b c d θ v ρ

ignorable mostly fell in the range of 10 to 10 w m 2 and accounted for less than 2 of the available energy during the rice cultivation season to evaluate surface energy balance closure daily energy balance ratio ebr calculated by using the corrected fluxes were average as 0 93 and 0 85 in 2015 and 2016 rice seasons respectively higher than that reported by studies at fluxnet sites baldocchi et al 2001 wilson et al 2002 the energy balance deficit problem was entirely related to the underestimation of sensible and latent heat fluxes as indicated in literatures wilson et al 2002 foken 2008 foken et al 2011 and the energy gap could be closed through the evaporative fraction method gebler et al 2014 2 5 evaporation fraction and enforcing energy balance closure evaporation fraction ef is defined as the ratio of latent heat flux to available energy rn g0 shuttleworth et al 1989 nutini et al 2014 5 ef l e r n g 0 using eq 5 ef can be calculated at either an hourly scale or at a daily scale on this basis the energy gap can be closed by distributing the energy balance deficit ebd calculated as rn g0 le hs to the sensible and latent heat fluxes according to the ef closure method which consists of three steps as introduced by kessomkiat et al 2013 and gebler et al 2014 2 6 measured and estimated et rice et were measured independently by the weighed micro lysimeters etml and ec system etec for canopy and field scales in current study in our previous work slight difference was found in magnitude and phase between etml and etec because of the spatial scale effect liu et al 2018 the relationship between measured etml and etec values was proposed thus the field scale et could be calculated by the measured et at canopy scale according to the relationship termed as ettrue in current research ef in different periods of daytime 7 00 8 00 8 00 9 00 9 00 10 00 10 00 11 00 11 00 12 00 12 00 13 00 13 00 14 00 14 00 15 00 and 15 00 16 00 gmt 8 were calculated using eq 5 based on available energy measurement during the corresponding periods then the daily et etef d was estimated based on daily available energy and hourly ef by eq 6 sugita and brutsaert 1991 6 et ef d 86400 e f λ d r n g 0 d where etef d is the hourly to daily up scaling et estimation through the evaporation fraction method mm day 1 λ is the latent flux of heat mj kg 1 λ 2 501 2 361 10 3 ta ta is the average daily temperature c the subscripts d indicates the average daily 24 h value taken daily ef as standard value the ef in different time intervals 7 00 8 00 8 00 9 00 15 00 16 00 h were used instead of daily ef to calculate daily etef d using eq 6 it should be noted that etef d or ettrue d is daily rather than daytime et because rn g0 d is calculated for 24 hours if the daytime et needs to be calculated rn g0 should be the value during daylight period in eq 6 with ettrue calculated by the measured etml as standard value daily et value estimated from different hour of day ef etef were evaluated by calculating the linear regression slope coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and index of agreement ioa the r2 rmse and ioa were calculated as the following

and o are the mean estimated and measured values respectively and n is the number of samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 mean diurnal variation of energy budget components in different rice phenological stages the stage average energy balance components rn g0 le and hs varied in a unimodal shape in each of rice phenological stages fig 4 usually the value of le was largely affected by rn g0 and the curve of its diurnal variation was basically the same as rn g0 compared with hs the diurnal variation amplitude of le was much greater the le flux was the main consumer of the external drive energy hence the estimation of et water in millimeter equivalent to le is the most important process in determining the exchanges of energy and mass in a paddy field in addition the proportion of le to available energy was relatively low in the yellow ripening stage less than 80 per cents reasons might be related to the decreased transpiration rate of rice in the non vigorous growth stage as well as to the lower soil moisture condition during yellow ripening stage without irrigation notably rn g0 decreased suddenly and abruptly during the transition periods from daytime to nighttime resulting in big gap between le and rn g0 with rn g0 0 and le 0 this phenomenon can be ascribed to the difference in variation phase of rn and g0 during the same periods during daytime to nighttime transition rn decreased rapidly from positive to negative however the transmission of energy from the air to the soil heat flux plate through a thickness of soil was not an instantaneous process some time being necessary for the heat flux plate to response to the energy change poblete echeverría et al 2014 thus the decrease in g0 lagged behind rn led to the uncertainly negative energy rn g0 in this period 3 2 mean diurnal variation of ef in the different rice growth stages because rn g0 is close to zero in the nighttime and is uncertain value during the transition periods from daytime to nighttime the hourly ef is easy to fluctuate abruptly thus only estimated ef during the daytime from 7 00 to 16 00 h is included diurnal variation of ef and their error bars of the rice in the different growth stages of 2015 and 2016 re greening early tillering middle tillering later tillering jointing and booting heading to flowering milk and yellow ripening stage are shown in fig 5 ef exhibits an approximately concave up shape with a minimum at noon 10 00 11 00 11 00 12 00 or 12 00 13 00 in different growth stages of rice season but it fluctuates occasionally which are probably caused by cloud rainy events and other non fair weather conditions hence when weather conditions are variable the hypothesis of constant ef during the daytime may not be satisfied and the procedure may result in considerable error lhomme and elguero 1999 gentine et al 2007 chávez et al 2009 near sunrise and sunset hourly ef increase sharply in most growth stages available energy that appears in the denominator of ef is small near these times gentine et al 2007 the error bars of ef varied dramatically especially during the growth period with lower rn g0 energy flux see figs 4 and 5 there is no significant difference in ef among different growth stages except in yellow ripening during yellow ripening the lowest ef occurs with average ef about 0 79 due to lower available energy canopy coverage and soil moisture on that stage fig 5 also shows the mean diurnal cycle of hourly ef averaged over the whole rice growth days red line in bold the hourly ef exhibits a typical concave up shape with a gentle variation during 10 00 14 00 period and a minimum around 10 00 11 00 am therefore the hourly ef during 10 00 14 00 period may lead to less error in daily evapotranspiration estimation 3 3 seasonal variation in daily or daytime ef seasonal variation of daily or daytime ef and the events of precipitation and irrigation in the whole wsi rice growing season in 2015 and 2016 are shown in fig 6 in 2015 the daily ef in the re greening stage approximately stabilizes at 0 88 the daily ef increases gradually reaching their respective maximum 1 0 in the late tillering stage and then decreases along with time to milk maturity mostly higher than 0 9 during the milk period the daily ef reaches another peak then daily ef in the yellow ripening stage significantly reduces to about 0 8 and the mean ef for the whole growth season is 0 92 in 2016 the daily ef in the re greening stage varies less remarkably and then increases gradually it reaches 1 0 in several days of milk stage and then drops sharply along with the decrease of soil moisture also falls below 0 8 the mean daily ef for the whole growth season is 0 92 the difference in seasonal variation of daily ef between 2015 and 2016 is ascribed to the rice phenological traits influenced by meteorological condition liu et al 2018 additionally the ef values in current study are obviously greater than the reports that from upland crops e g wheat vines cotton and so on gentine et al 2007 li et al 2008 bezerra et al 2015 bagley et al 2017 which is ascribed to the moist soil water environment and the subtropical monsoon climate the soil moisture content of paddy field is wetter than dryland even if it is under the water saving irrigation practice meanwhile the larger vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation in subtropical monsoon climate make latent heat flux an absolute major energy consumption item they are also greater than the result of kar and kumar 2016 who reported that the daily ef was 79 82 in different cultivars cv lalat and gayatri and two rainfed rice seasons of 2008 and 2009 for the boro rice transplanted on 29 january and the aman rice transplanted on 20 august periods ef were 0 71 and 0 74 on seasonal average respectively reported by hossen et al 2012 the daytime defined as the time between 7 00 16 00 of a day ef values are also shown in fig 6 the daytime ef fluctuates obviously with the daily ef during the rice growth stage suddenly and abruptly increasing after every irrigation or heavy rain for example rainfall on 22 october 113 days after transplantation in 2016 increased ef from 0 72 to 0 92 and irrigation on 5 july ninth day after transplantation in 2015 increased ef from 0 77 to 0 86 the results agree with kustas et al 1993 and li et al 2008 although the climatic conditions and crop species are different in this study the wsi rice field is located in the subtropical monsoon climate region with the specific wetting drying cycle of soil condition thus the energy partition will tend to increase et water in millimeter equivalent to le in energy balance after the rapid increase of soil water content as resulted from irrigation and precipitation in addition the mean daytime ef for the whole growth stage of 2015 and 2016 are almost the same about 0 86 lower than the daily values since the assumption of ef variation is not satisfied during nighttime actually this difference term regardless of nocturnal energy distribution and the contribution of night et can be as large as 7 many papers discussed the contribution of nighttime et like tolk et al 2006 who reported the nighttime et was 3 over a cotton season for a dryland 7 2 for an irrigated alfalfa crop and as much as 12 in the semi arid high plains sugita and brutsaert 1991 and chávez et al 2009 emphasized that a 24 h period should be considered in daily et estimation by extrapolating instantaneous values since nighttime et may not be negligible notable a comparison of the variation of daily vs daytime ef values shows the latter value varies greatly and abruptly in both years possible as results of the temporal scale difference in daily and daytime ef calculation the energy transfer including le is a continuous process the energy stored in the soil canopy air and biomass in the daytime is partly released at night therefore the sum of le and hs is larger than the available energy during nighttime as the result of the energy balance of nighttime and daytime errors as well as the great difference in climate and soil moisture condition in the daytime the result in ef calculation is more suddenly and abruptly at daytime scale than daily scale 3 4 time of day representativeness of ef in estimating daily et daily estimated rice et termed as etef d was predicted by eq 6 with daily available energy data and hourly ef at different daytime hours performance of etef d calculation against the measured ettrue d in 2015 and 2016 rice seasons are shown in fig 7 for etef d estimated based on hourly ef at the specific local time from 07 00 to 16 00 the regression slope between etef d and etture d is always less than 1 0 both in 2015 and 2016 reaching the minimum at noon and then increase correspondingly etef d calculated based on ef at different hours underestimate the true value ettrue d 3 835 and 3 816 mm day 1 in 2015 and 2016 respectively the error of the estimated etef d is great when it is calculated with hourly ef at sunset or sunrise period fig 7 the correlations between etef d and ettrue d are much better during 10 00 11 00 with higher r2 of 0 983 and 0 987 higher ioa of 0 993 and 0 996 and lower rmse of 0 291 and 0 221 mm day 1 in 2015 and 2016 respectively although underestimation is non ignorable a meaningful question is if there is a time of day when ef is most representative or has the best performance in et estimation this is an important issue in et estimation by remote sensing with ef method based on instantaneous observations however it seems difficult to give a universal best hour of measurements valid for different sites because the choice of hour will depend on the crop species soil and canopy surface and meteorological conditions of the study site in general the estimation of ef around noon would be representative of the daily average and is preferred to be used for et up scaling from hourly to daily shuttleworth et al 1989 crago 1996 colaizzi et al 2006 chávez et al 2009 in our case the regression slope between etef d and etture d was never greater than 1 0 the value of the ef taken around midday is smaller than the daytime average this may lead to underestimation of daytime et in addition during the night the ef shows large variations and is highly unstable this means using the ef up scaling method results in an underestimation of daily et over wsi rice field with any one time of day ef value and a modification is worth exploring results for performance of etef based on 10 00 11 00 periods compared with the etture and the corresponding available energy rn g0 during the rice growth stage are reported in fig 8 in both rice seasons seasonal simulated etef and the measured ettrue varied in a consistent pattern but different from other regions as a result of difference in magnitude and process of rn g0 several researches indicated that rice et generally got the maximum in the heading to flowering stage with the maximum lai tyagi et al 2000 timm et al 2014 for example rice et reached maximum of 7 mm day 1 when lai was at its peak flowering stage and decreased with decrease of lai in maturation stage reported by timm et al 2014 the similar phenomenon was reported in japan tyagi et al 2000 and in california hatala et al 2012 while in current study both etture and etef reached the maximum in the late 2015 and middle 2016 tillering stage and then decreased along with the crop growth in late season the difference in seasonal variation of rice et among different years and other regions are ascribed to the rice phenological traits liu et al 2018 for early rice which transplanted in spring or early summer the vigorous growth stage coincides with the period in july or august with highest solar radiation for later rice which mostly transplanted in later summer the vigorous growth stage occurs in september when the temperature and radiation are lower than in july or august as a result et largely affected by rn is generally larger in late july or early august middle and late tillering stages for later rice furthermore the results depicted in fig 8 also confirm that etef and etture frequently has a considerable gap an underestimation of 15 6 and 13 4 on average for 2015 and 2016 seasonal ettrue respectively such a stable and considerable gap bring forward a demand in forming a rational relationship between the etef d calculated by the best time of day representativeness 10 00 11 00 of ef and effective daily etture d in current research for practical purposes correction procedure proposed should be simple considering vapor pressure deficit vpd is the key factor affecting et especially at night li et al 2008 ding et al 2010 it is used to set up the correction procedure by eureqa software v 0 83 data in 2015 and 2016 rice season were used for calibration and validation of the proposed et correction procedure and correlation was as follows 10 et sim d a et ef d b vpd d where etsim d is the simulated daily et with the correction procedure etef d is the estimated daily et by up scaling using ef during10 00 11 00 period vpdd is the daily mean vapor pressure deficit kpa and a and b are the locally calibrated constant this attempt is illustrated in fig 9 in which etsim d is modified with a 1 and b 0 5 respectively based on the calibration dataset the result for validation is satisfactory with a high correlation coefficient of 1 027 lower rmse of 0 205 mm day 1 much better than that without correction r2 and ioa are 0 987 and 0 996 for validation dataset both very close to 1 0 and the same as results without correction in summary the result confirms that the proposed procedure can be useful for practical purposes specially even if the time of satellite overpass is not consistent with the best time of day representativeness of ef in estimating daily et the relationship between them can be established according to the diurnal variation of hourly ef in advance 4 conclusions this study is aimed at analyzing and providing insights into the diurnal and seasonal behavior of ef and its time of day representativeness in estimating daily et variation of energy budget components was used to explain the exchanges of energy and the patterns observed in ef in the wsi paddy field diurnal variation of ef exhibits an approximately concave up shape in different growth stages of rice season and the mean diurnal cycle exhibits a typical concave up shape with a gentle variation during 10 00 14 00 period and a minimum around 10 00 11 00 am seasonally the range of daily ef is mostly higher than 0 8 except in later yellow ripening period with an average of 0 92 which is obviously greater than the reports that from upland crops the result in ef calculation varied more suddenly and abruptly at daytime scale than daily scale the mean daytime ef for the whole growth stage is 0 86 7 lower than the daily values a comparison of estimated etef d based on hourly ef with the measured ettrue d reveals that the regression slope is mostly lower than 1 0 the correlation between etef d estimated with the best time of day 10 00 11 00 representativeness of ef and ettrue d is quite high r2 of 0 983 and 0 987 ioa of 0 993 and 0 996 the underestimation can be as large as 15 6 and 13 4 on average for 2015 and 2016 respectively then a correction procedure is proposed by simply incorporating variable of vpd to form a liner regression equation with et value following the ef up scaling method as independent variable it resulted in satisfactory result for daily et estimation by an improved ef up scaling method it will provide a scientific basis and a useful tool for accurately estimating daily

5686,targeting field scale implementation of conservation practices cps in agricultural watersheds is critical to meeting sustainable resource management goals this not only needs accurate and extensive field scale assessment but also incorporation of willingness of the farmers to adopt the suite of practices many useful watershed models have not only lacked in accurate siting of field scale practices based on rigorous physiographic terrain criteria and hydro conditioned digital elevation models dems but also limited in mathematically incorporating farmer s uncertain diverse and conflicting viewpoints into the model which is pivotal to tmdl scenario assessment this study develops an integrated decision support framework dsf to site cp opportunities at the field scale using high resolution light detection and ranging lidar hydro conditioned dem and other secondary data using python coding dsf integrates three robust models namely prioritize target and measure application ptmapp agricultural conservation planning framework acpf and hydrological simulation program fortran scenario application manager hspf sam the novel nature of this framework is its ability to facilitate precision planning at field scale by siting the optimized conservation practices to achieve tmdl s based on i rigorous terrain derivatives and siting criteria ii simulation of accurate stream flow network extensive hydro conditioning and d infinity approach for flow accumulation and iii incorporating diverse conflicting and uncertain preferences of farmers using fuzzy logic the framework offers a simplified interface to the locals to simultaneously address agronomical siting practices to improve soil health and crop productivity hydrological improving water quality tmdl s ecological delineation of sites for riparian buffers and socio economic farmer preferences and cost analysis objectives with moderate technical expertise besides field scale practice siting one of the superior features of the model is its flexibility to filter out even technically feasible cost effective practices if they are not preferred by farmers and thus giving a realistic assessment of tmdl s

hspf sam ptmapp 1 introduction directly measuring and synthesizing water quality data throughout a watershed is practically infeasible due to time and economic constraints thus managing and mitigating the impacts of agricultural farm non point source pollution nps has been a challenge for decades turner et al 2012 michalak et al 2013 srinivas et al 2019 excess nutrient particularly nitrogen and phosphorus and sediment loads from farms deteriorate the water quality of lakes and streams bossio et al 2010 u s epa 2015 which not only make water unfit for human consumption but also pose severe threats to the ecosystem singh et al 2007 srinivas et al 2017 watershed management using models is essential to simulate hydrological and nutrient transport processes crop growths and cause and effect relationships at various watershed scales meiyappan et al 2014 von gunten et al 2015 srinivas et al 2018 however an enormous challenge in front of watershed planners is to bridge the gap between planning at watershed scale and precise implementation of practices at field scale to achieve water quality goals although models can be run at watershed scale agricultural pollution can best be addressed by precision field scale implementation within small watersheds as pollutants can be disproportionately generated from a small number of fields shortle et al 2012 nasta et al 2018 watershed models such as soil and water assessment tool swat abbaspour et al 2014 better assessment science integrating point and nonpoint sources basins annualized agricultural non point source annagnps model water erosion prediction project wepp long term hydrologic impact assessment model l thia and the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf have been extensively used to quantify farm pollution and facilitate implementation of best management practices bmps parajuli et al 2009 shen et al 2009 giri et al 2012 epelde et al 2016 srinivas and singh 2018 however to date these models are mostly limited to conservation planning scenario development kalcic et al 2015 and lack the ability to propose targeted field scale conservation practice opportunities majority of model outputs are generated at sub basin levels and the scale is too large for use in on the ground implementation for example the swat model lumps together the areas with homogeneous land use characteristics soil type and terrain into hydrologic response units hrus because hrus do not incorporate actual field boundaries it is not possible to recommend accurate field specific practices it becomes a challenge for local watershed modelers to communicate these model s outcomes to farmers for ground implementation required to achieve tmdls to effectively guide them a new decision support framework dsf is proposed in this study which can site agricultural conservation practices at targeted field locations based on hydro conditioned dem rigorous terrain derivatives and physiographic criteria economic and ecologic benefits and assessment of farmer s willingness to adopt the practice in short the dsf can guide tmdls planning scenarios by simultaneously addressing agronomic hydrologic ecologic and economic elements with minimal processing time cost and technical expertise the dsf focuses on detailed and accurate flow network routing and representation at field scale which is pivotal to simulate hydrological and nutrient transport processes this allows modeler to perform rigorous terrain analysis and choose appropriate physiographic criteria for identifying sites to place practices using advanced gis technology state federal and local organizations across the globe are investing considerable time money and expertise to develop robust decision support tools for assessing hydrologic and water quality problems in a targeted manner and adopting cost effective solutions is a major priority u s a is beginning to explore the integrated application of agricultural conservation planning framework acpf prioritize target and measure application ptmapp and hydrological simulation program fortran scenario application manager hspf sam for addressing nutrient and sediment pollution from farms exclusive features of acpf include usage of extensive terrain and physiographic criteria to site field scale practices ptmapp performs an excellent field scale routing of pollutants delivered to the practices and determined treatment costs and hspf sam takes the practices delineated by acpf and ptmapp to develop scenarios to achieve tmdls while ranking the practices based on farmer s viewpoints the integrated framework is unique as it identifies strong features of these models and integrates them using python coding to achieve major watershed objectives the framework is flexible to incorporate any criteria for practice placements which makes it universally applicable to any watershed using the desired input data it uses advanced gis precision conservation technology and has a potential to identify and prioritize polluted watersheds at field scale the decision makers can build implementation plans considering hydrology water quality soil health agricultural productivity and economic efficiency all three tools are capable of siting practices in the watershed however the integrated model plays a key role in cost savings as it incorporates the complex and ambiguous viewpoints of farmers in a quantitative manner using hybridized fuzzy logic technique srinivas et al 2018 many times farmers are unwilling to adopt the practices delineated by a particular model rather they may prefer practices which were not ranked high using any one of these models as a result the nutrient load reductions and tmdls and water quality improvements suggested by the model becomes unrealistic as the desired practices cannot be implemented on ground therefore a realistic framework is needed wherein ranking of the practices can be modified by incorporating the judgements of farmers and local users such practices would be actually implementable thereby giving a factual estimate of cost effective tmdls scenarios one of the exclusive features of integrated model is its ability to process hydro conditioned dem 3 m 3 m raster and thus enabling it to perform extensive terrain analysis precise estimation of runoff parameters and accurate and detailed representation of stream network within every 5 acres despite high quality resolution of lidar based dems hydrologic modelers encounter certain challenges the topographies such as road fill culverts and bridges and other elevated surfaces obstruct the natural flow of water and without hydro conditioning roads appear as dams and surface water flow is dammed by raised topography until flow can spill over the road or create false pooling on the upstream side which represents highly inaccurate flow paths leading to sub standard quality of hydrologic modeling poppenga et al 2013 another advantage of combined dsf is usage secondary topographic attributes stream power index and topographic wetness index in conjunction to primary attributes such as slope aspect plan and profile curvature flow path length and upslope drainage area to characterize spatial variability of specific hydrological geomorphological and ecological processes occurring at field scale moreover a robust flow routing has been performed using d infinity approach where flow direction is represented as single angle taken as the steepest downward slope on the eight triangular facets centered at each grid point to obtain upslope area flow is proportioned between two downslope pixels the approach allows flows from a single grid cell to be proportionally distributed to two downstream cells rather than a single cell as with the conventional d8 flow model these features makes the proposed dsf superior to models such as rusle2 environmentalpolicy integrated climate epic and agricultural policy environmental extender apex which have been widely used by united states department of agriculture usda natural resources conservation services nrcs field offices foster et al 2003 wang et al 2011 cochrane et al 2019 for estimation of soil erosion and quantification of nutrient load reductions from individual agricultural conservation practices even sophisticated models such as swat and hit don t yield results with desirable accuracy as hydro conditioning of dem is not dealt at all pai et al 2012 sommerlot et al 2013 the integrated framework of acpf ptmapp and hspf sam has been applied for plum creek watershed in minnesota minnesota is home to more than 12 000 lakes and 6500 natural rivers and streams it is essential to have a comprehensive and focused modeling approach a dsf to ensure the state s many watershed programs including watershed restoration and protection strategies wraps and one watershed one plans owop actually result in an effective and efficient bmp implementation on the ground in particular this study aims to 1 demonstrate the importance of hydro conditioned lidar based dem for detailed flow routing reliable pollution reduction outcomes and precise practice placement 2 identifying targeted field scale bmps to produce field scale maps for farmer engagement 3 evaluate the cost effectiveness and nutrient reduction efficacy of modeled bmps and 4 provide realistic tmdl scenarios by incorporating farmer s willingness in siting practices overall the proposed dsf guide local watershed coordinators to bridge the gap between model predictions conservation practice scenarios and actual on the ground implementation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the dsf is demonstrated using the watershed data from plum creek watershed in cottonwood county minnesota plum creek is a 35 4 mile long 57 0 km stream near the city ofwalnut grove it passes to the northwest of the town flowing northeasterly to thecottonwood river with its waters then flowing to theminnesota riverand eventually themississippi river the total hydrological unit code huc 12 watershed area is about 30 286 acres and includes 20 catchments the watershed is comprised of 649 fields ranging from 2 5 to 400 acres according to cropland data layer cdl 2018 the majority of the agricultural land 78 is used for growing corn and soybeans other agricultural uses include wheat alfalfa pasture millet and oats most of the land in the watershed is used for agriculture 80 while the remaining land is categorized as wetland 10 developed 6 forest 3 and barren 1 the watershed receives an annual average of 71 cm ofrainfall and 43 in of snow its elevation is about 371 m above sea level clay loam loam and sandy loam are the major soil types found in the watershed fig 1 represents the plum creek watershed along with crop data layer of 2018 2 2 methodology to develop field scale dsf the study attempts to understand and integrate the robust features of three advanced gis watershed modeling tools acpf ptmapp and hspf sam the interpretation of outcomes from these models serve as basis to analyze the viability of the proposed dsf the goal is to identify a framework that addresses agronomic hydrologic ecologic and socio economic criteria and produces results that will engage farmers in on the ground implementation of practices as each of these tools are developed to achieve certain watershed objectives they use specific sets of inputs represented in table a 1 of the appendix a some of the input data like hydro conditioned dem remain common for all the tools while ptmapp and hspf sam consider nutrient and sediment loadings all outputs in acpf are primarily generated based on terrain analysis and tile drainage characteristics the primary data sources include united states geological survey national hydrology dataset usgs nhd 2018 national agricultural statistics service nass 2018 usda natural resources conservation service usda nrcs 2018 minnesota pollution control agency mpca 2018 and minnesotadepartment of natural resources mndnr 2018 all the data have been procured for a time period of 9 years january 2010 december 2018 additional input data sets have been generated using terrain analysis software wilson et al 2000 and advanced gis tools these data sets include flow direction and accumulation raster upstream and downstream travel time stream reach and flow network distance to the stream field slope statistics height above channel stream power index topographic wetness index and sediment delivery ratio among the listed inputs lidar hydro conditioned dem holds special importance lidar provides high resolution 3 m 3 m raster interpolated to 1 cm elevation which facilitates field scale analysis and generate accurate maps using the outcomes of these tools tomer et al 2013 poppenga et al 2013 2 2 1 hydro conditioning process many times lidar derived dem s have small artifacts that are present as false depressions or pits which needs to be filled to smoothen the dem using advanced arcgis 10 6 1 features before performing hydro conditioning in this study cell sinks which are deeper than surrounding cells without any flow are identified and filled then the elevations of unfilled and filled dem are compared to create a difference raster if the depth of sink is deeper than the maximum filled depth it is considered as true depression for such regions deepest cell is hole punched in this way multiple iterations are run to ensure that only true depressions remain dem plum creek in the case study includes features such as bridges railroad grade overlaying culverts road fills and other elevated surfaces that impede the natural flow of surface water hydrologic dem representing the accurate surface water flow is needed to simulate the flow through the bridges and under culverts hydro conditioning is a time consumptive challenging process and is extremely important to obtain an accurate flow network for the placement of conservative practices heidemann 2012 the process adopted in this study has two steps namely hydro flattening and hydro enforcement hydro flattening smoothens the interpolated surface over the water bodies such as lakes river etc thereby generating a gradual gradient downstream on the other hand hydro enforcement first identifies the impeded flows at the obstructions such as roads and visualizes all the flow paths using flow accumulation raster to identify inaccurate flow paths ponding effect and spilling over flow residuals between the filled and unfilled dems are calculated to delineate undrained depressions and adjusting the elevation values for structures such as culverts and bridges that artificially prevent downslope flow across the dem cut lines are placed where there is an obstruction to the flow path and dam lines are placed where there are desired obstructions table 1 represents the different levels of hydro conditioning and corresponding planning scale in the present study h3dem level of hydro conditioning is performed to facilitate planning and implementation at field scale impeded flows have been identified using the depth grid raster in arcgis figs b 1 and b 2 of the appendix b represent the pre and post hydro conditioning status of the dem fig 2 gives magnified representation of the flow paths before and after conducting hydro conditioning process there are no backed up flows which indicates that the dem has been hydro conditioned and accurately represents the watershed hydrology which is very useful in identifying targeted locations for placing practices at field scale 2 2 2 uniqueness of integrated decision support framework this section highlights some of the important features of acpf ptmapp and hspf sam and their basic methodology detailed explanations have been provided in other research papers and user manuals and is beyond the scope of this paper agricultural conservation planning framework acpf developed by usda ars produces a menu of bmps at field scale level thereby enabling precise planning at the hydrologic unit code huc 12 watershed scale using precision gis technology acpf identifies tile drained dominated areas and sites in field edge of field and riparian practices it uses hydro conditioned dem to perform rigorous terrain analysis which includes detailed d infinity flow routing in every 5 acres generating stream power index spi and topographic wetness index twi to evaluate runoff risk tomer et al 2013 the tool also helps farmers and planners to work together to control water within and below fields through the siting of controlled drainage grassed waterways filter strips and impoundments this treatment train approach effectively improves water quality in a local agricultural watershed by reducing trapping and treating the nutrient flows the detailed methodology of acpf has been explained in tomer et al 2015 and porter et al 2018 acpf field scale map outputs have proven to be a successful method for engaging local stakeholders and landowners in the watershed planning and implementation decision making process ranjan et al 2019 the prioritize target and measure application ptmapp is an innovative arcgis tool developed in 2012 by the international water institute iwi and houston engineering inc hei with funding from the minnesota board of water and soil resources bwsr in addition to acpf functions ptmapp estimates pollutant loading from and cost effectiveness of proposed conservation practices ptmapp generates field scale catchments and evaluates hydrologic travel times to priority resources and catchment outlets which include estimating tp tn and sediment yields and loadings and generating volumes and peak discharge for 2 year 24 h and 10 year 24 hour events based on nrcs design criteria it assesses bmp suitability assessing potential locations to place practices such as storage filtration biofiltration infiltration protection and source reduction and measures nutrient and sediment load reductions from implementation of bmps and cps one of the unique features of ptmapp is its ability to calculate cost and treatment cost mass of load reduced of implementing practices based on nrcs environmental quality intensive program eqip payment schedules and thus developing cost effective targeted implementation plan the detailed methodology of ptmapp has been described in the user guide of ptmapp bwsr and iwi 2019 as well as in watershed case studies hei 2018 ptmapp has been constructed based on the calibrated field scale rusle 2 model sommerlot et al 2013 cochrane et al 2019 hspf sam developed by mpca and respec helps watershed stakeholders design and build cost effective and prioritized conservation practice scenarios scenarios using calibrated hspf model outputs to achieve tmdls the gis based framework uses bmp database land use and land cover data to allows planners to choose a mix of bmps based on cost efficiency and source pollutant loading with processing time measured in minutes instead of months sam has been extensively used and tested in many agricultural and forested landscapes of minnesota over the last 4 years mpca 2017 for tmdl and wraps programs it analyzes stream reach concentration and load basin and source load basin and source load rate and basin and source fate in addition to discharge the parameters analyzed by sam include sediment total nitrogen total phosphorus total ammonia nitrate and nitrate and orthophosphate unique feature of sam is its ability to quantitatively incorporate willingness of farmers in ranking the bmps the process gives realistic nutrient load reductions the stepwise methodology of sam has been explained in its user manual mpca 2017 the dsf developed in this study aims to utilize strong features of these three tools viz i rigorous terrain analysis siting criteria and riparian assessment of acpf ii source nutrient assessment and cost analysis of ptmapp and iii tmdl scenario assessment and incorporation of farmers willingness of hspf sam all three models have been coded using python language the coupling has been done by making modifications to the coding of these tools ptmapp code has been modified in such a way that it can ingest the acpf shape files of all the practices and calculate the load reduction and cost corresponding to each practice independently hspf sam doesn t site any practice therefore the practices delineated by acpf ptmapp combination have been ingested in hspf sam to run tmdl scenario analysis and ranking the practices according to the farmer s opinion 2 2 3 about rusle and runoff modeling for modeling agricultural runoff ptmapp and hspf sam use united states department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars calibrated field scale revised universal soil loss equation rusle2 model foster et al 2003 rusle 2 gives field scale estimates of annual sediment yields using the eq 1 as given below 1 a n n

performed by using calibrated results on simulated and of natural plots 2000 plot years and 10 000 plot years of data respectively nrcs 2003 once the sediment yield is estimated for each raster 3 3 sq

of hydrologic flows toward and along streams to pourpoints which are defined as outlet or inlet of a watershed each pourpoint will have its own watershed and everything upstream from it will define a watershed important and necessary watershed planning features of these tools are identified to integrate them in a way that will result in the most complete and accessible information transfer to watershed planners 3 1 field scale outcomes using acpf acpf generated a total of 729 bmps for plum creek watershed where areas dominated by tile drainage management and surface runoff have been identified and practices are sited in order to control reduce water and nutrient movement within fields below field and in riparian zones 3 1 1 field scale runoff risk assessment and controlling practices runoff risk assessment is carried out based on slope steepness and proximity to the stream the steepness of agricultural field is determined based on the 75th percentile slope value slope analysis reveals that mean slope in plum creek watershed is about 5 14 with majority of the fields having slopes in the range of 3 4 the stream proximity is eventually converted into sediment delivery ratio sdr using an equation from the minnesota phosphorus index edge of fields whose distances are less than 10 ft from the stream are assigned an sdr value of 1 0 and the those whose distances are 5000 ft or more as assigned an sdr value of 0 17 fig 3 represents the runoff risk assessment map generated by acpf where category very high represents fields with steeper slopes occurring near the stream and low represents fields that are neither steep nor close to the stream about 65 of the agricultural fields in the watershed have a gentle slope and only 10 fall into the steep slope category runoff risk assessment identifies the fields where erosion and runoff controlling practices can be installed grassed waterways and contour buffer strips are two of the best bmp options for mitigating the formation of gullies and thus reducing runoff and sediment transport to field edges pike et al 2009 zhou et al 2014 once stream reach network flow pathways and stream power index raster are properly delineated using terrain analysis of high resolution dem grassed waterways of a constant width of 10 m can be installed with careful designing grassed waterways and contour buffer strips can be used to reduce total nitrogen and nitrate loadings discharged from the fields acpf places contour buffer strips perennial vegetation in the fields with 4 15 slopes by generating contour intervals according to usda natural resources conservation service nrcs guidelines these strips are atleast 100 m in length and they buffer the concentrated flow paths having a drainage area of at least 2 acres zhou et al 2014 the presence of steeper slopes and high sdr is very meager in plum creek watershed most of the agricultural fields 70 have an sdr values of less than 0 4 and slopes in the range of 3 4 indicating low susceptibility to runoff the distributions of grassed waterways and contour buffer strips are illustrated in fig 3 3 1 2 identifying tile drainage pathways for placing drainage management practices fields that are tile drained are identified based on soil gssurgo raster and slope conditions tile drains are typically installed in row crop fields where 90 of the field has less than 5 slope and where the field s hydric soil percentage is 10 or at least 40 of the field s soils are poorly drained i e mapped in a dual hydrologic group typically a d b d c d or d soils if a field meets these conditions acpf will site appropriate drainage water management practices drainage water management practices consist of controlled gate structures which are used to lower or raise the water table during the year these practices can provide water quality benefits by treating the water that moves along subsurface tile drains in the plum creek watershed based on gssurgo mean hydric soil percentage of each field is calculated about 89 of the fields have more than 10 hydric soil percentage and 33 are poorly drained a d b d c d or d soils occupy more than 40 of the field moreover there are about 46 fields having a slope of less than 5 in 90 of their respective areas acpf utilizes above mentioned spatial and topographic criteria to identify areas likely to be tile drained out of 649 fields 270 agricultural fields 42 are tile drained in plum creek watershed fig b 3 of the appendix b acpf outcomes reveal that controlled drainage management practices can be installed in 40 of the fields which are tile drained fig 4 controlled drainage management practices can be installed in 19 of the fields total of 123 in 25 fields these practices can be applied in more than 50 of the field area according to nitrogen science team 2013 drainage water management has the potential to reduce nitrogenous nitrate loads by 33 by controlling tile drainage volumes 3 1 3 edge of field practices bioreactors nutrient removal wetlands farm ponds and water and sediment control basins wascobs are some of the most effective edge of field practices for treating tile discharge and runoff based on topography runoff risk assessment stream flow network drainage table and gssurgo raster acpf identifies the potential locations for installation of these practices the nitrate reducing bacteria inside bio reactors performs an excellent denitrification function woli et al 2010 for plum creek watershed acpf identifies 103 potential bioreactor locations bioreactors would occupy about 0 1 of the total watershed area while providing denitrification benefits to about 17 2 of the total watershed area nutrient removal wetlands nrws help remove nitrate from tile drainage on a watershed scale tomer et al 2013 and farm ponds and wascobs trap sediment and phosphorus from surface runoff wetlands and farm ponds also contribute additional ecosystem benefits with adequate hydraulic residence time nrw can remove more than 50 of nitrate loadings o geen et al 2010 the criteria used for siting nrws are as follows a pooled area drainage ratio is 0 5 2 0 b buffer area pooled area ratio less than 4 0 c bank height less than 4 0 m and d collective flow paths 150 acres acpf generates points at 100 m intervals along stream network and flow pathways where upslope contributing areas exceed 150 acres each of these points are tested for suitability to place nrws acpf also site vegetated buffers in those areas where the surface elevation is within 1 5 m of the wetland pool elevation fig b 4 of the appendix b represents the sites of both bioreactors and nrws fig 5 gives magnified view of bioreactors and nrws along with associated vegetated buffers and drainage areas for plum creek watershed a total of 52 nrw practices have been identified which occupy about 2 of the total watershed area wascobs are installed every 200 ft along the drainage network of 2 to 50 acres in size to reduce sediment and total phosphorus loadings lessen gully formation and decreasing peak runoff discharge nrcs 2014 an embankment height of 1 5 m has been chosen based on nrcs guidelines for the study area d infinity flow accumulation grid is analyzed and all those points are removed where elevation difference with the next upstream point is not enough to install a wascob at 1 5 m without flooding out the upstream location for chosen points 100 m wide transect is drawn perpendicular to the mean direction of flow of that drainageway the elevation profile of the transect line is then analyzed based on two criteria viz i each side of the drainageway must exceed the height of the embankment to ensure sufficient curvature of placement of wascob and ii each side of the drainageway must not exceed twice the height of the embankment to prevent suggesting wascobs in drainage ways that are too incised in addition wascobs falling within 50 m of the perennial stream and those intersecting a field s boundary are deleted manual processing is done to remove wascobs that either touch or are within 10 m of one other fig 6 indicates that a total of 63 wascobs can be installed in plum creek watershed with a contributing drainage area of about 3 farm ponds differ from nutrient removal wetlands in terms of the drainage area 5 100 acres treated by them they have diverse uses such as fishery production biodiversity sediment detention and movement and retaining spring time tile drainage water for reuse their construction affects local topography as it involves substantial excavation and earthmoving acpf delineates the flow paths for the drainage area ranging from 5 to 100 acres each flow path is divided into 100 foot long segments and slope of each segment is calculated to analysis decreasing or increasing trends in slope profile midpoints of segments are found to check whether side slopes fall within the 20 50 range and meet nrcs embankment slope requirements then the buffers of 20 30 40 50 and 60 m are created from each tested point criterion that 80 of the elevation range is greater than the sample point is set to find the furthest buffer distance impoundment height not exceeding 10 m for the proposed pond is determined based on this distance at the desirable sites impoundment is simulated in the dem creating a ponded area along with a vegetated free board of 1 m acpf identifies a total of 24 potential farm pond practice opportunities covering a 5 drainage area of the plum creek watershed fig 6 shows field scale potential locations for placing wascobs along with depths and farm ponds 3 1 4 riparian assessment acpf places significant emphasis siting riparian practices which provide immense ecological benefits each stream reach is divided into a number of segments 250 m each and catchments corresponding to each segment are delineated fig b 5 of the appendix b represents the riparian catchments delineated for plum creek watershed and the corresponding tile drainage areas the riparian zone within each catchment is defined as a 90 m buffer out from the stream reach related with each catchment the width of the buffers is assessed based on major ecological functions which ranks the riparian zone as high medium or low based on two criteria viz i the potential to provide denitrification of shallow groundwater based on the width of the low lying land 1 5 m within 90 m of the stream and ii total runoff contributing area in the riparian zone of each catchment based on the ranks buffer widths are designed as follows i minimum of a 6 m wide buffer emphasizing on stream bank stability for riparian zones with low runoff and a narrow low lying land zone ii wider buffer 10 90 m consisting of stiff stemmed grasses and multi species buffer to meet the nrcs recommended 0 02 buffer contributing area ratio to trap nutrient and sediment in areas where surface runoff dominates and iii wider buffer with deep rooted vegetation tolerant of saturated soils 25 50 m in sensitive zones dominated with wide low lying land and multispecies buffer to trap nutrients most of the buffers for plum creek watershed include wider zones of low lying land with deep rooted vegetation to promote enhanced denitrification these are riparian attribute polygons raps which represent the relationship between riparian catchment and buffer fig 7 about 18 370 tile acres drain toward riparian catchments for plum creek watershed fig b 6 of the appendix b however the actual amount of tile water discharged into a saturated buffer located in a riparian catchment would depend on the area of cropland drained length of the riparian corridor receiving the diverted drainage and soil site vegetation characteristics riparian attribute polygons raps are identified based on runoff passing through riparian zones and denitrification potential riparian buffers help intercept runoff improve shallow groundwater recharge facilitate growth of saturated buffer vegetation and stabilize stream banks tomer et al 2015 raps deliver a spatial framework to assemble and categorize terrain data on shallow water table and runoff contributing areas acpf sited a total of 736 raps for plum creek watershed ideal zones for riparian management include areas where shallow groundwater and surface runoff can be intercepted in the absence of such conditions benefits such as bank stabilization can be achieved through selection of different buffer species acpf identifies the locations to install saturated buffers which can treat subsurface discharge of tile drainage water jaynes and isenhart 2014 in addition acpf ensures that soils in raps possess high organic content that will act as a substrate for denitrification saturated buffers have the potential to provide up to 55 nutrient load reduction jaynes and isenhart 2014 in addition they provide habitat benefits fig 7 shows 744 riparian buffers that have been identified for plum creek watershed the buffer types sited include stiffed stemmed grass multispecies buffer deep rooted vegetation and stream bank stabilization 3 2 outcomes of ptmapp an exclusive feature of ptmapp is its ability to prioritize and target practice locations that provide measurable water quality benefits at field scale ptmapp can be used for a identifying sources and amount of sediment nitrogen and phosphorus leaving the landscape b targeting specific fields for bmp implementation and c estimating the benefits in terms of downstream load reduction reaching a lake river in a cost effective manner of single or multiple bmps within a watershed ptmapp uses the pourpoints generated by acpf to identify priority resource points the priority resource points are the locations at which tn tp and sediment source loads are routed to and where source load reductions can be summarized for potential practices it also uses the same hydro conditioned dem used for acpf although ptmapp identified 3 priority points for the plum creek watershed for illustration all outcomes of ptmapp are evaluated with respect to one priority point ptmapp assesses sources of sediment tons acre total nitrogen tn lbs acre or total phosphorus tp lbs acre year to priority resource points or watershed outlets fig 8 fig b 7 of the appendix b represents sources of phosphorus the results indicate that many locations from lower watershed contribute sediment nitrogen and phosphorus however the rate of contribution of sediment 0 6 2 2 tons acre year nitrogen 4 26 6 62 lbs acre year and phosphorus 0 23 0 44 lbs acre year to the priority resource point is higher in upper plum creek high sediment and nutrient areas would provide ideal locations for implementing targeted practices however it is essential to first evaluate the feasibility of implementing these strategies using the nrcs field office technical guide fotg potential opportunities for implementing bmps within the watershed is evaluated based on topographic and land use characteristics typical placement and design criteria size of contributing drainage area land slope and flow regime fig 9 represents the targeted locations for structural infiltration biofiltration protection and storage and non structural practices filtration and source reduction ptmapp sited protection and source reduction practices within more than 50 of the watershed practices sited include grassed waterways critical planting areas shoreline protection cover crops and perennial crops storage wascobs drainage management farm ponds and filtration practices grassed waterways filter strips were sited in 15 20 of the watershed area in total ptmapp cited 1483 bmps for plum creek watershed treatment costs in tons or lbs year dollar spent has been evaluated based on annual life cycle costs for various treatment groups given by nrcs eqip payment schedules 2019 table a 2 in the appendix a for plum creek watershed treatment cost for sediment and nitrogen have been represented in fig 10 results indicate that nitrogen treatment using filtration costs between 2 94 and 908 91 lbs year sediment reduction costs also show a wide range between 293 68 and 6659 58 ton year for most of the targeted locations of the watershed similarly treating phosphorus figure now shown due to brevity reasons runoff using grassed waterways critical planting and shoreline restoration costs range between 0 and 10 524 lbs year it is very evident that practically it is not cost effective to install all practices sited by acpf and ptmapp thus ptmapp combines analysis of practice location with pollution reduction and cost effectiveness assessments the criteria suggested by mpca viz i cost effectiveness to reduce sediment 10 000 ton and to reduce tp 10 000 lb as measured at the priority resource point and ii sediment reductions from 2 year 24 hour event 1 ton and tp reductions from 2 year 24 hour event 1 lb have been used based on these criteria out of 1483 bmps delineated by ptmapp only 133 practices were found suitable for priority resource point 1 fig 11 however most of the farmers would adopt only those practices which costs less than 500 year therefore fig 11 represents costs of only those practices a total of 79 which a farmer can adopt suitable practices included storage wascobs drainage management farm ponds or nutrient removal wetlands and protection grassed waterways critical planning or shoreline restoration practices for illustration table 2 represents practices corresponding to some of the locations sediment nutrient load treated and associated cost each of these practices have a catchment i d and co ordinates associated with it which indicate the exact targeted location of these practices within the watershed thus decision makers can generate field scale maps which can aid in landowner outreach and education 3 3 comparison of acpf and ptmapp outcomes for plum creek watershed identifying targeted locations of practices at the field scale is pivotal in developing an effective implementation plan to achieving nutrient and sediment reduction goals the bmps sited by acpf can be placed under various categories of treatment groups suggested by ptmapp fig 12 figs b 8 b 12 in the appendix b compare the sites delineated by acpf and ptmapp for bioreactors grasses waterways and contour buffer strips riparian catchments storage perennials and cover crops for illustration bioreactor locations exhibit some coherence to fair degree however acpf provides a greater number of locations this is because ptmapp considers nutrient loadings in identifying targeted locations while acpf primarily focuses on tile drainage and extensive terrain analysis for filtration practices grassed waterways filter strips both acpf and ptmapp outcomes coincide to good degree greater than80 in addition to grassed waterways acpf also gives locations for contour buffer strips acpf and ptmapp targeted areas for placing protection practices also matched up well greater than70 ptmapp mainly focuses on critical planting areas and shoreline restoration acpf performs a more thorough riparian assessment and delineates zones for deep rooted vegetation multi species buffers stiff stemmed grasses and stream bank stabilization acpf not only analyzes the hydrology but also emphasizes ecological benefits for storage practices wascobs farm ponds nutrient removal wetlands and drainage management only about 50 60 sites identified by ptmapp and acpf are common acpf outcomes are more reliable because the tool performs superior tile drainage and stream network analysis acpf uses minnesota conservation reserve enhancement project crep criteria drainage area ratio buffer area ratio bank height collective flow paths of 60 ha ptmapp outcomes are primarily based on runoff volume and denitrification potential ptmapp sites infiltration practices not accounted for in acpf which include multi stage ditches and infiltration trenches another major difference between the tools is that acpf not only gives targeted sites for practices but also gives details and characteristics of each practice for example in the case of wascobs acpf identifies shape and depth of wascob basins embankment height etc this is critical information for watershed planers and farmers table 3 highlights some of the major differences between ptmapp and acpf in siting bmps based on the results more details are given in table a 3 of the appendix a this table can be used by decision makers or the watershed planners to not only understand the strengths of these tools but also better understand differences observed in their results thus depending upon their objectives planners can use either one of tool or combination of them while acpf offers superior terrain analysis ptmapp is uniquely valuable because it incorporates pollutant loadings and performs cost analyses as discussed in the previous section considering the costs of various treatment groups ptmapp delineates 133 practices which consisted of source reduction and protection practices for the plum creek watershed fig 13 shows a comparison of bmp locations generated using ptmapp and acpf about 70 75 of the sites suggested by these tools are common indicating a strong potential for both of these tools to facilitate development of local watershed plans 3 4 model development incorporate acpf outcomes into ptmapp ptmapp and acpf do more than giving visual representation of the bmp opportunities and each tool has unique strengths ptmapp performs an excellent nutrient and sediment loading assessment and cost analysis in siting the practices and acpf performs superior riparian assessment stream network delineation tile drainage analysis and terrain analysis of dem as a decision maker the best planning and implementation will come from a blended use of these tools a suggested dsf that blends the tools is provided in fig 14 in brief the dsf recommends that planners to incorporate the acpf tool into the ptmapp tool so that acpf practices can be analyzed for nutrient and sediment load efficiencies and so that cost analysis can be performed when acpf practices are incorporated into ptmapp water quality benefits can be estimated this includes pollutants delivered to each of the practices and sediment total phosphorus and total nitrogen removal rates for local watersheds and within larger regions earlier ptmapp and acpf proposed 133 and 729 practices respectively when run separately after incorporating acpf polygons into ptmapp a total of 729 practices are proposed before imposing any restriction on costs however after restricting the cost as suggested by mpca cost effectiveness to reduce sediment 10 000 ton and to reduce tp 10 000 lb as measured at the priority resource point sediment reductions from 2 year 24 hour event 1 ton and tp reductions from 2 year 24 hour event 1 lb 537 practices are delineated much more than ptmapp practices fig 15 by coupling these tools strengths of both tools are utilized to determine the most complete set of water quality planning and implementation information which can be used by farmers and watershed planners table a 4 in the appendix a represents a few of the practices along with the loadings and associated cost obtained by incorporating acpf outcomes into ptmapp 3 5 scenario assessment integrating hspf sam to developed model incorporating acpf polygons into ptmapp provides a valuable dsf in and of itself hspf sam further enhances its value by giving flexibility to decision makers to design and simulate different cost optimized scenarios for achieving tmdls in addition sam has the capability to incorporate farmers viewpoint in the modeling framework three scenarios have been modeled i base scenario representing original condition of plum creek watershed without implementing any practices ii sam scenario 1 finding the reduction in nutrients and sediments in the reach concentration by implementing a set of targeted practices suggested by incorporate acpf ptmapp model and ii sam scenario 2 observing the change in scenario 1 outcomes under severe climatic conditions development and outcomes of sam scenario 1 have been described below using hspf sam several land use changes are designed such as developed forest cropland low till grassland pasture wetland as shown in fig 16 sam divides entire plum creek watershed into 8 sub watersheds for each of the sub watersheds 20 cropland and 20 developed land have been changed to grassland the total changed area in each sub watershed is shown in table 4 in addition to land uses sam gives planners the flexibility to choose bmps from a bmp pool having 24 practices in the plum creek watershed combined use of acpf and ptmapp identified 537 cost effective practices these practices were input into hspf sam to develop various cost optimized scenarios based on tmdl and wraps water quality goals here sam allows watershed planners to incorporate the degree of willingness of the farmers which has a tremendous impact on ranking the bmps for example if a practice has more than 50 suitability based on feasibility criteria cost and its ability to meet water quality goals sam assigns higher rank to that practice however if a farmer is unwilling to adopt that practice despite its other advantageous his opinion is given significant weightage which is incorporated mathematically the tool assesses the feasibility criteria and farmers viewpoints and assigns an optimized rank to the practice which gives a realistic perspective degree of willingness of the farmers has been calculated using a hybridized fuzzy based technique designed by the authors in their previous work srinivas et al 2018 this approach effectively incorporates the uncertain conflicting and diverse opinion of the farmers group towards each practice the results indicate that the degree of willingness ranges between 25 and 50 for most of the practices selected for this study thus the integrated model saves time as well as cost by giving realistic estimate of cost and water quality benefits that can be achieved by implementing practices at field scale table 5 represents the treated area and the total cost year for placing riparian buffers and wascobs in the watershed based on mpca costs scenario 2 has been developed by changing the climatic conditions of scenario 1 to severe to see how the changing climate affects the functioning of the practices fig 17 compare the reach concentration load of sub watershed a187 for all three scenarios similar comparisons have been performed for sediment and phosphorus as well figs b 13 b 15 the percentage reduction in total nitrogen per dollar lbs year achieved after applying scenario 1 has been represented in fig 18 scenario comparison guides the planners to achieve tmdl water quality goals tables 6 8 show how sam helps the planner to evaluate the percentage reduction achieved in total phosphorus by running sam scenario 1 table 6 sets the total phosphorus lbs day tmdls for various sub watersheds in plum creek watershed whereas table 7 represents the total phosphorus for the base scenario and scenario 1 table 8 represents the reduction needed and that achieved by scenario 1 the results guide the decision maker to select a greater number of cost efficient practices in order to achieve the phosphorus reduction goal 3 5 1 estimating optimized practices based on budget and farmer s opinion it is essential to rank the practices while striking a balance between achieving tmdls cost and farmer s viewpoint for example scenario 1 costs 362 472 for achieving an overall 15 nitrogen reduction in sub watershed a185 with the practices suggested by acpf ptmapp model in the case of plum creek watershed the budget has been fixed to 250 000 to achieve 15 overall nitrogen reduction based on cost availability and farmers preferences based on optimized budget the ranks of 26 preferred practices have been represented in table 9 the results indicate that with this budget an 8 5 nitrogen reduction can be achieved the progress to target of 15 column indicates the percentage contribution from each practice to reach the 8 5 nitrogen reduction with fixed budget for illustration filter strips 50 ft wide cropland field edge helps in achieving 0 376 reduction in nitrogen such realistic estimate of water quality improvement saves immense cost and time of the modelers and planners without optimization there were more than 75 cost effective practices suggested for this sub watershed thus a lot of time and cost that could have been invested in planning and designing these practices have been saved using the integrated framework developed in this study the results show that using only one model would not be cost effective as it will lead to either delineation of too less or too many practices at the field scale due to absence of optimization component fig 19 summarizes the costs and number of practices for a sub watershed a185 delineated by each of the models as well the integrated framework using ptmapp alone there will be only 15 practices 153 022 which offers less variety of practices moreover farmer s viewpoint is not incorporated by ptmapp while delineating these practices only using hspf sam appears cost effective but it doesn t site the field scale locations of the practices no doubt acpf and acpf ptmapp models do give focused field scale siting of practices the number of practices and costs are high 73 and 1 261 330 the broad variety of practices delineated by acpf ptmapp model would surely offer more flexibility to the farmers but the top choices of the model are not always preferred by the farmers the integration of hspf sam in the modeling framework effectively addresses this issue by modifying the ranks of practices and filtering out least preferred practices based on the available budget and farmer s opinion the integrated framework highlighted in fig 19 helps in savings cost time and resources as it provides a mix of 26 practices 250 000 while including farmer s opinion in the decision process thus all the three watershed models namely ptmapp acpf and hspf sam contribute equally fig 20 towards development of optimized and flexible scenario based framework that can be communicated to the landowners along with field scale maps 4 conclusions this study develops a novel dsf for field scale analysis of agricultural conservation practices using three advanced watershed modeling tools acpf ptmapp and hspf sam the outcomes of integrated model aimed to bridge the gap between modeling at watershed scale and implementation at field scale by coupling critical components of these watershed tools watershed planning and implementation decisions can be made in a simpler faster more accurate and cost effective manner bmp opportunities can also be more effectively discussed with local farmers and other stakeholders use of hdm3 hydro conditioned dem was critical to obtaining successful results specifically the loading and cost analysis provided by ptmapp the stream network delineation tile drainage terrain analysis and riparian assessment of acpf and the optimized scenario development aspect of hspf sam have been utilized in the dsf application of the proposed dsf in the plum creek watershed showed promising results ptmapp alone identified only 133 cost effective practices however when acpf practices were incorporated into ptmapp the combined outcome was the siting of 537 cost effective practices as well as an estimate of nutrient and sediment load reductions adding hspf sam allowed planners to analyze bmp opportunities using a defined budget set watershed pollutant load reduction goals and change climate conditions scenario analysis in plum creek with a set budget of 250 000 only showed an 8 5 nitrogen reduction the dsf delineates field scale practices while incorporating the conflicting viewpoints of the farmers which leads to a more realistic tmdl assessment this dsf can facilitate field scale planning of any huc 12 watershed provided input data requirements are fulfilled future work should express how to communicate field scale maps to landowners it is believed that this study captures the importance of procuring more accurate and precise field specific data for better field scale estimations and ultimately better practice implementation credit authorship contribution statement r srinivas

5686,targeting field scale implementation of conservation practices cps in agricultural watersheds is critical to meeting sustainable resource management goals this not only needs accurate and extensive field scale assessment but also incorporation of willingness of the farmers to adopt the suite of practices many useful watershed models have not only lacked in accurate siting of field scale practices based on rigorous physiographic terrain criteria and hydro conditioned digital elevation models dems but also limited in mathematically incorporating farmer s uncertain diverse and conflicting viewpoints into the model which is pivotal to tmdl scenario assessment this study develops an integrated decision support framework dsf to site cp opportunities at the field scale using high resolution light detection and ranging lidar hydro conditioned dem and other secondary data using python coding dsf integrates three robust models namely prioritize target and measure application ptmapp agricultural conservation planning framework acpf and hydrological simulation program fortran scenario application manager hspf sam the novel nature of this framework is its ability to facilitate precision planning at field scale by siting the optimized conservation practices to achieve tmdl s based on i rigorous terrain derivatives and siting criteria ii simulation of accurate stream flow network extensive hydro conditioning and d infinity approach for flow accumulation and iii incorporating diverse conflicting and uncertain preferences of farmers using fuzzy logic the framework offers a simplified interface to the locals to simultaneously address agronomical siting practices to improve soil health and crop productivity hydrological improving water quality tmdl s ecological delineation of sites for riparian buffers and socio economic farmer preferences and cost analysis objectives with moderate technical expertise besides field scale practice siting one of the superior features of the model is its flexibility to filter out even technically feasible cost effective practices if they are not preferred by farmers and thus giving a realistic assessment of tmdl s the model is applicable to any hydrologic unit code huc 12 sub watershed and has been demonstrated for plum creek watershed in minnesota results showed 537 cost effective practices including bioreactors grassed waterways nutrient removal wetlands water and sediment control basins and riparian buffers yielded an 8 5 reduction in total nitrogen constrained with a budget of 250 000 field

hspf sam ptmapp 1 introduction directly measuring and synthesizing water quality data throughout a watershed is practically infeasible due to time and economic constraints thus managing and mitigating the impacts of agricultural farm non point source pollution nps has been a challenge for decades turner et al 2012 michalak et al 2013 srinivas et al 2019 excess nutrient particularly nitrogen and phosphorus and sediment loads from farms deteriorate the water quality of lakes and streams bossio et al 2010 u s epa 2015 which not only make water unfit for human consumption but also pose severe threats to the ecosystem singh et al 2007 srinivas et al 2017 watershed management using models is essential to simulate hydrological and nutrient transport processes crop growths and cause and effect relationships at various watershed scales meiyappan et al 2014 von gunten et al 2015 srinivas et al 2018 however an enormous challenge in front of watershed planners is to bridge the gap between planning at watershed scale and precise implementation of practices at field scale to achieve water quality goals although models can be run at watershed scale agricultural pollution can best be addressed by precision field scale implementation within small watersheds as pollutants can be disproportionately generated from a small number of fields shortle et al 2012 nasta et al 2018 watershed models such as soil and water assessment tool swat abbaspour et al 2014 better assessment science integrating point and nonpoint sources basins annualized agricultural non point source annagnps model water erosion prediction project wepp long term hydrologic impact assessment model l thia and the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf have been extensively used to quantify farm pollution and facilitate implementation of best management practices bmps parajuli et al 2009 shen et al 2009 giri et al 2012 epelde et al 2016 srinivas and singh 2018 however to date these models are mostly limited to conservation planning scenario development kalcic et al 2015 and lack the ability to propose targeted field scale conservation practice opportunities majority of model outputs are generated at sub basin levels and the scale is too large for use in on the ground implementation for example the swat model lumps together the areas with homogeneous land use characteristics soil type and terrain into hydrologic response units hrus because hrus do not incorporate actual field boundaries it is not possible to recommend accurate field specific practices it becomes a challenge for local watershed modelers to communicate these model s outcomes to farmers for ground implementation required to achieve tmdls to effectively guide them a new decision support framework dsf is proposed in this study which can site agricultural conservation practices at targeted field locations based on hydro conditioned dem rigorous terrain derivatives and physiographic criteria economic and ecologic benefits and assessment of farmer s willingness to adopt the practice in short the dsf can guide tmdls planning scenarios by simultaneously addressing agronomic hydrologic ecologic and economic elements with minimal processing time cost and technical expertise the dsf focuses on detailed and accurate flow network routing and representation at field scale which is pivotal to simulate hydrological and nutrient transport processes this allows modeler to perform rigorous terrain analysis and choose appropriate physiographic criteria for identifying sites to place practices using advanced gis technology state federal and local organizations across the globe are investing considerable time money and expertise to develop robust decision support tools for assessing hydrologic and water quality problems in a targeted manner and adopting cost effective solutions is a major priority u s a is beginning to explore the integrated application of agricultural conservation planning framework acpf prioritize target and measure application ptmapp and hydrological simulation program fortran scenario application manager hspf sam for addressing nutrient and sediment pollution from farms exclusive features of acpf include usage of extensive terrain and physiographic criteria to site field scale practices ptmapp performs an excellent field scale routing of pollutants delivered to the practices and determined treatment costs and hspf sam takes the practices delineated by acpf and ptmapp to develop scenarios to achieve tmdls while ranking the practices based on farmer s viewpoints the integrated framework is unique as it identifies strong features of these models and integrates them using python coding to achieve major watershed objectives the framework is flexible to incorporate any criteria for practice placements which makes it universally applicable to any watershed using the desired input data it uses advanced gis precision conservation technology and has a potential to identify and prioritize polluted watersheds at field scale the decision makers can build implementation plans considering hydrology water quality soil health agricultural productivity and economic efficiency all three tools are capable of siting practices in the watershed however the integrated model plays a key role in cost savings as it incorporates the complex and ambiguous viewpoints of farmers in a quantitative manner using hybridized fuzzy logic technique srinivas et al 2018 many times farmers are unwilling to adopt the practices delineated by a particular model rather they may prefer practices which were not ranked high using any one of these models as a result the nutrient load reductions and tmdls and water quality improvements suggested by the model becomes unrealistic as the desired practices cannot be implemented on ground therefore a realistic framework is needed wherein ranking of the practices can be modified by incorporating the judgements of farmers and local users such practices would be actually implementable thereby giving a factual estimate of cost effective tmdls scenarios one of the exclusive features of integrated model is its ability to process hydro conditioned dem 3 m 3 m raster and thus enabling it to perform extensive terrain analysis precise estimation of runoff parameters and accurate and detailed representation of stream network within every 5 acres despite high quality resolution of lidar based dems hydrologic modelers encounter certain challenges the topographies such as road fill culverts and bridges and other elevated surfaces obstruct the natural flow of water and without hydro conditioning roads appear as dams and surface water flow is dammed by raised topography until flow can spill over the road or create false pooling on the upstream side which represents highly inaccurate flow paths leading to sub standard quality of hydrologic modeling poppenga et al 2013 another advantage of combined dsf is usage secondary topographic attributes stream power index and topographic wetness index in conjunction to primary attributes such as slope aspect plan and profile curvature flow path length and upslope drainage area to characterize spatial variability of specific hydrological geomorphological and ecological processes occurring at field scale moreover a robust flow routing has been performed using d infinity approach where flow direction is represented as single angle taken as the steepest downward slope on the eight triangular facets centered at each grid point to obtain upslope area flow is proportioned between two downslope pixels the approach allows flows from a single grid cell to be proportionally distributed to two downstream cells rather than a single cell as with the conventional d8 flow model these features makes the proposed dsf superior to models such as rusle2 environmentalpolicy integrated climate epic and agricultural policy environmental extender apex which have been widely used by united states department of agriculture usda natural resources conservation services nrcs field offices foster et al 2003 wang et al 2011 cochrane et al 2019 for estimation of soil erosion and quantification of nutrient load reductions from individual agricultural conservation practices even sophisticated models such as swat and hit don t yield results with desirable accuracy as hydro conditioning of dem is not dealt at all pai et al 2012 sommerlot et al 2013 the integrated framework of acpf ptmapp and hspf sam has been applied for plum creek watershed in minnesota minnesota is home to more than 12 000 lakes and 6500 natural rivers and streams it is essential to have a comprehensive and focused modeling approach a dsf to ensure the state s many watershed programs including watershed restoration and protection strategies wraps and one watershed one plans owop actually result in an effective and efficient bmp implementation on the ground in particular this study aims to 1 demonstrate the importance of hydro conditioned lidar based dem for detailed flow routing reliable pollution reduction outcomes and precise practice placement 2 identifying targeted field scale bmps to produce field scale maps for farmer engagement 3 evaluate the cost effectiveness and nutrient reduction efficacy of modeled bmps and 4 provide realistic tmdl scenarios by incorporating farmer s willingness in siting practices overall the proposed dsf guide local watershed coordinators to bridge the gap between model predictions conservation practice scenarios and actual on the ground implementation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the dsf is demonstrated using the watershed data from plum creek watershed in cottonwood county minnesota plum creek is a 35 4 mile long 57 0 km stream near the city ofwalnut grove it passes to the northwest of the town flowing northeasterly to thecottonwood river with its waters then flowing to theminnesota riverand eventually themississippi river the total hydrological unit code huc 12 watershed area is about 30 286 acres and includes 20 catchments the watershed is comprised of 649 fields ranging from 2 5 to 400 acres according to cropland data layer cdl 2018 the majority of the agricultural land 78 is used for growing corn and soybeans other agricultural uses include wheat alfalfa pasture millet and oats most of the land in the watershed is used for agriculture 80 while the remaining land is categorized as wetland 10 developed 6 forest 3 and barren 1 the watershed receives an annual average of 71 cm ofrainfall and 43 in of snow its elevation is about 371 m above sea level clay loam loam and sandy loam are the major soil types found in the watershed fig 1 represents the plum creek watershed along with crop data layer of 2018 2 2 methodology to develop field scale dsf the study attempts to understand and integrate the robust features of three advanced gis watershed modeling tools acpf ptmapp and hspf sam the interpretation of outcomes from these models serve as basis to analyze the viability of the proposed dsf the goal is to identify a framework that addresses agronomic hydrologic ecologic and socio economic criteria and produces results that will engage farmers in on the ground implementation of practices as each of these tools are developed to achieve certain watershed objectives they use specific sets of inputs represented in table a 1 of the appendix a some of the input data like hydro conditioned dem remain common for all the tools while ptmapp and hspf sam consider nutrient and sediment loadings all outputs in acpf are primarily generated based on terrain analysis and tile drainage characteristics the primary data sources include united states geological survey national hydrology dataset usgs nhd 2018 national agricultural statistics service nass 2018 usda natural resources conservation service usda nrcs 2018 minnesota pollution control agency mpca 2018 and minnesotadepartment of natural resources mndnr 2018 all the data have been procured for a time period of 9 years january 2010 december 2018 additional input data sets have been generated using terrain analysis software wilson et al 2000 and advanced gis tools these data sets include flow direction and accumulation raster upstream and downstream travel time stream reach and flow network distance to the stream field slope statistics height above channel stream power index topographic wetness index and sediment delivery ratio among the listed inputs lidar hydro conditioned dem holds special importance lidar provides high resolution 3 m 3 m raster interpolated to 1 cm elevation which facilitates field scale analysis and generate accurate maps using the outcomes of these tools tomer et al 2013 poppenga et al 2013 2 2 1 hydro conditioning process many times lidar derived dem s have small artifacts that are present as false depressions or pits which needs to be filled to smoothen the dem using advanced arcgis 10 6 1 features before performing hydro conditioning in this study cell sinks which are deeper than surrounding cells without any flow are identified and filled then the elevations of unfilled and filled dem are compared to create a difference raster if the depth of sink is deeper than the maximum filled depth it is considered as true depression for such regions deepest cell is hole punched in this way multiple iterations are run to ensure that only true depressions remain dem plum creek in the case study includes features such as bridges railroad grade overlaying culverts road fills and other elevated surfaces that impede the natural flow of surface water hydrologic dem representing the accurate surface water flow is needed to simulate the flow through the bridges and under culverts hydro conditioning is a time consumptive challenging process and is extremely important to obtain an accurate flow network for the placement of conservative practices heidemann 2012 the process adopted in this study has two steps namely hydro flattening and hydro enforcement hydro flattening smoothens the interpolated surface over the water bodies such as lakes river etc thereby generating a gradual gradient downstream on the other hand hydro enforcement first identifies the impeded flows at the obstructions such as roads and visualizes all the flow paths using flow accumulation raster to identify inaccurate flow paths ponding effect and spilling over flow residuals between the filled and unfilled dems are calculated to delineate undrained depressions and adjusting the elevation values for structures such as culverts and bridges that artificially prevent downslope flow across the dem cut lines are placed where there is an obstruction to the flow path and dam lines are placed where there are desired obstructions table 1 represents the different levels of hydro conditioning and corresponding planning scale in the present study h3dem level of hydro conditioning is performed to facilitate planning and implementation at field scale impeded flows have been identified using the depth grid raster in arcgis figs b 1 and b 2 of the appendix b represent the pre and post hydro conditioning status of the dem fig 2 gives magnified representation of the flow paths before and after conducting hydro conditioning process there are no backed up flows which indicates that the dem has been hydro conditioned and accurately represents the watershed hydrology which is very useful in identifying targeted locations for placing practices at field scale 2 2 2 uniqueness of integrated decision support framework this section highlights some of the important features of acpf ptmapp and hspf sam and their basic methodology detailed explanations have been provided in other research papers and user manuals and is beyond the scope of this paper agricultural conservation planning framework acpf developed by usda ars produces a menu of bmps at field scale level thereby enabling precise planning at the hydrologic unit code huc 12 watershed scale using precision gis technology acpf identifies tile drained dominated areas and sites in field edge of field and riparian practices it uses hydro conditioned dem to perform rigorous terrain analysis which includes detailed d infinity flow routing in every 5 acres generating stream power index spi and topographic wetness index twi to evaluate runoff risk tomer et al 2013 the tool also helps farmers and planners to work together to control water within and below fields through the siting of controlled drainage grassed waterways filter strips and impoundments this treatment train approach effectively improves water quality in a local agricultural watershed by reducing trapping and treating the nutrient flows the detailed methodology of acpf has been explained in tomer et al 2015 and porter et al 2018 acpf field scale map outputs have proven to be a successful method for engaging local stakeholders and landowners in the watershed planning and implementation decision making process ranjan et al 2019 the prioritize target and measure application ptmapp is an innovative arcgis tool developed in 2012 by the international water institute iwi and houston engineering inc hei with funding from the minnesota board of water and soil resources bwsr in addition to acpf functions ptmapp estimates pollutant loading from and cost effectiveness of proposed conservation practices ptmapp generates field scale catchments and evaluates hydrologic travel times to priority resources and catchment outlets which include estimating tp tn and sediment yields and loadings and generating volumes and peak discharge for 2 year 24 h and 10 year 24 hour events based on nrcs design criteria it assesses bmp suitability assessing potential locations to place practices such as storage filtration biofiltration infiltration protection and source reduction and measures nutrient and sediment load reductions from implementation of bmps and cps one of the unique features of ptmapp is its ability to calculate cost and treatment cost mass of load reduced of implementing practices based on nrcs environmental quality intensive program eqip payment schedules and thus developing cost effective targeted implementation plan the detailed methodology of ptmapp has been described in the user guide of ptmapp bwsr and iwi 2019 as well as in watershed case studies hei 2018 ptmapp has been constructed based on the calibrated field scale rusle 2 model sommerlot et al 2013 cochrane et al 2019 hspf sam developed by mpca and respec helps watershed stakeholders design and build cost effective and prioritized conservation practice scenarios scenarios using calibrated hspf model outputs to achieve tmdls the gis based framework uses bmp database land use and land cover data to allows planners to choose a mix of bmps based on cost efficiency and source pollutant loading with processing time measured in minutes instead of months sam has been extensively used and tested in many agricultural and forested landscapes of minnesota over the last 4 years mpca 2017 for tmdl and wraps programs it analyzes stream reach concentration and load basin and source load basin and source load rate and basin and source fate in addition to discharge the parameters analyzed by sam include sediment total nitrogen total phosphorus total ammonia nitrate and nitrate and orthophosphate unique feature of sam is its ability to quantitatively incorporate willingness of farmers in ranking the bmps the process gives realistic nutrient load reductions the stepwise methodology of sam has been explained in its user manual mpca 2017 the dsf developed in this study aims to utilize strong features of these three tools viz i rigorous terrain analysis siting criteria and riparian assessment of acpf ii source nutrient assessment and cost analysis of ptmapp and iii tmdl scenario assessment and incorporation of farmers willingness of hspf sam all three models have been coded using python language the coupling has been done by making modifications to the coding of these tools ptmapp code has been modified in such a way that it can ingest the acpf shape files of all the practices and calculate the load reduction and cost corresponding to each practice independently hspf sam doesn t site any practice therefore the practices delineated by acpf ptmapp combination have been ingested in hspf sam to run tmdl scenario analysis and ranking the practices according to the farmer s opinion 2 2 3 about rusle and runoff modeling for modeling agricultural runoff ptmapp and hspf sam use united states department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars calibrated field scale revised universal soil loss equation rusle2 model foster et al 2003 rusle 2 gives field scale estimates of annual sediment yields using the eq 1 as given below 1 a n n u a l s e d i m e n t y i e l d t o n s a c r e y e a r r k l s c p where r is the climate erodibility factor based on rainfall and temperature hundreds of ft t in ac hr yr 1 k is the soil erodibility factor l is the length slope factor s is slope steepness factor c is the land cover and management factor and p is the support practice factor the calibration and validation of rulse 2 model has been performed by using calibrated results on simulated and of natural plots 2000 plot years and 10 000 plot years of data respectively nrcs 2003 once the sediment yield is estimated for each raster 3 3 sq m cell within the watershed sediment delivery ratio sdr for each cell is determined using flow accumulation raster to calculate the sediment reaching the watershed outlet i e flowline jain and kothyari 2000 developed a methodology to estimate sdr as given below in eqs 2 and 3 2 sdr n e γ t n 3 t n i 1 n l i a i s i where sdr n represents sdr for nth grid cell t n is overland travel time

use 2 2 4 sediment routing as the sediment is transported downstream sd it follows an exponential decay function represented in the form of first order transport loss eq 4 as given below 4 sd u e β t d 50 where u is the mass of sediment at upstream location in tons year β is transport coefficient and t is the travel time in hours and d 50 is mean sediment diameter similarly total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp delivered downstream once it reaches a flowline can also be represented using a first order loss eq 5 as given below 5 m e k t where m is the nitrogen phosphorus mass delivered to the flowline in pounds k is the decay rate day and t is travel time hours from the flowline to a specific downstream location the annual runoff volume and peak discharges event magnitude can be specified duration is 24 hour are used within ptmapp to develop a continuous function for estimating practice removal percentage bounded by literature values the annual runoff volume i e excess depth multiplied by watershed area is calculated using nrcs runoff curve number cn method the curve number value is computed for the drainage area contributing to a specific cell in the raster and the annual runoff volume for the area upstream assigned to the cell the peak discharge 2 day 24 hour 10 day 24 hour rainfall is calculated based upon methods describe in nrcs tr 55 nrcs 1986 for each cell in the raster 3 results and discussion the study ran all three of the above models in the plum creek watershed the lidar based 3 m grid hydro conditioned dem fig 2 is used to ensure accurate routing of hydrologic flows toward and along streams to pourpoints which are defined as outlet or inlet of a watershed each pourpoint will have its own watershed and everything upstream from it will define a watershed important and necessary watershed planning features of these tools are identified to integrate them in a way that will result in the most complete and accessible information transfer to watershed planners 3 1 field scale outcomes using acpf acpf generated a total of 729 bmps for plum creek watershed where areas dominated by tile drainage management and surface runoff have been identified and practices are sited in order to control reduce water and nutrient movement within fields below field and in riparian zones 3 1 1 field scale runoff risk assessment and controlling practices runoff risk assessment is carried out based on slope steepness and proximity to the stream the steepness of agricultural field is determined based on the 75th percentile slope value slope analysis reveals that mean slope in plum creek watershed is about 5 14 with majority of the fields having slopes in the range of 3 4 the stream proximity is eventually converted into sediment delivery ratio sdr using an equation from the minnesota phosphorus index edge of fields whose distances are less than 10 ft from the stream are assigned an sdr value of 1 0 and the those whose distances are 5000 ft or more as assigned an sdr value of 0 17 fig 3 represents the runoff risk assessment map generated by acpf where category very high represents fields with steeper slopes occurring near the stream and low represents fields that are neither steep nor close to the stream about 65 of the agricultural fields in the watershed have a gentle slope and only 10 fall into the steep slope category runoff risk assessment identifies the fields where erosion and runoff controlling practices can be installed grassed waterways and contour buffer strips are two of the best bmp options for mitigating the formation of gullies and thus reducing runoff and sediment transport to field edges pike et al 2009 zhou et al 2014 once stream reach network flow pathways and stream power index raster are properly delineated using terrain analysis of high resolution dem grassed waterways of a constant width of 10 m can be installed with careful designing grassed waterways and contour buffer strips can be used to reduce total nitrogen and nitrate loadings discharged from the fields acpf places contour buffer strips perennial vegetation in the fields with 4 15 slopes by generating contour intervals according to usda natural resources conservation service nrcs guidelines these strips are atleast 100 m in length and they buffer the concentrated flow paths having a drainage area of at least 2 acres zhou et al 2014 the presence of steeper slopes and high sdr is very meager in plum creek watershed most of the agricultural fields 70 have an sdr values of less than 0 4 and slopes in the range of 3 4 indicating low susceptibility to runoff the distributions of grassed waterways and contour buffer strips are illustrated in fig 3 3 1 2 identifying tile drainage pathways for placing drainage management practices fields that are tile drained are identified based on soil gssurgo raster and slope conditions tile drains are typically installed in row crop fields where 90 of the field has less than 5 slope and where the field s hydric soil percentage is 10 or at least 40 of the field s soils are poorly drained i e mapped in a dual hydrologic group typically a d b d c d or d soils if a field meets these conditions acpf will site appropriate drainage water management practices drainage water management practices consist of controlled gate structures which are used to lower or raise the water table during the year these practices can provide water quality benefits by treating the water that moves along subsurface tile drains in the plum creek watershed based on gssurgo mean hydric soil percentage of each field is calculated about 89 of the fields have more than 10 hydric soil percentage and 33 are poorly drained a d b d c d or d soils occupy more than 40 of the field moreover there are about 46 fields having a slope of less than 5 in 90 of their respective areas acpf utilizes above mentioned spatial and topographic criteria to identify areas likely to be tile drained out of 649 fields 270 agricultural fields 42 are tile drained in plum creek watershed fig b 3 of the appendix b acpf outcomes reveal that controlled drainage management practices can be installed in 40 of the fields which are tile drained fig 4 controlled drainage management practices can be installed in 19 of the fields total of 123 in 25 fields these practices can be applied in more than 50 of the field area according to nitrogen science team 2013 drainage water management has the potential to reduce nitrogenous nitrate loads by 33 by controlling tile drainage volumes 3 1 3 edge of field practices bioreactors nutrient removal wetlands farm ponds and water and sediment control basins wascobs are some of the most effective edge of field practices for treating tile discharge and runoff based on topography runoff risk assessment stream flow network drainage table and gssurgo raster acpf identifies the potential locations for installation of these practices the nitrate reducing bacteria inside bio reactors performs an excellent denitrification function woli et al 2010 for plum creek watershed acpf identifies 103 potential bioreactor locations bioreactors would occupy about 0 1 of the total watershed area while providing denitrification benefits to about 17 2 of the total watershed area nutrient removal wetlands nrws help remove nitrate from tile drainage on a watershed scale tomer et al 2013 and farm ponds and wascobs trap sediment and phosphorus from surface runoff wetlands and farm ponds also contribute additional ecosystem benefits with adequate hydraulic residence time nrw can remove more than 50 of nitrate loadings o geen et al 2010 the criteria used for siting nrws are as follows a pooled area drainage ratio is 0 5 2 0 b buffer area pooled area ratio less than 4 0 c bank height less than 4 0 m and d collective flow paths 150 acres acpf generates points at 100 m intervals along stream network and flow pathways where upslope contributing areas exceed 150 acres each of these points are tested for suitability to place nrws acpf also site vegetated buffers in those areas where the surface elevation is within 1 5 m of the wetland pool elevation fig b 4 of the appendix b represents the sites of both bioreactors and nrws fig 5 gives magnified view of bioreactors and nrws along with associated vegetated buffers and drainage areas for plum creek watershed a total of 52 nrw practices have been identified which occupy about 2 of the total watershed area wascobs are installed every 200 ft along the drainage network of 2 to 50 acres in size to reduce sediment and total phosphorus loadings lessen gully formation and decreasing peak runoff discharge nrcs 2014 an embankment height of 1 5 m has been chosen based on nrcs guidelines for the study area d infinity flow accumulation grid is analyzed and all those points are removed where elevation difference with the next upstream point is not enough to install a wascob at 1 5 m without flooding out the upstream location for chosen points 100 m wide transect is drawn perpendicular to the mean direction of flow of that drainageway the elevation profile of the transect line is then analyzed based on two criteria viz i each side of the drainageway must exceed the height of the embankment to ensure sufficient curvature of placement of wascob and ii each side of the drainageway must not exceed twice the height of the embankment to prevent suggesting wascobs in drainage ways that are too incised in addition wascobs falling within 50 m of the perennial stream and those intersecting a field s boundary are deleted manual processing is done to remove wascobs that either touch or are within 10 m of one other fig 6 indicates that a total of 63 wascobs can be installed in plum creek watershed with a contributing drainage area of about 3 farm ponds differ from nutrient removal wetlands in terms of the drainage area 5 100 acres treated by them they have diverse uses such as fishery production biodiversity sediment detention and movement and retaining spring time tile drainage water for reuse their construction affects local topography as it involves substantial excavation and earthmoving acpf delineates the flow paths for the drainage area ranging from 5 to 100 acres each flow path is divided into 100 foot long segments and slope of each segment is calculated to analysis decreasing or increasing trends in slope profile midpoints of segments are found to check whether side slopes fall within the 20 50 range and meet nrcs embankment slope requirements then the buffers of 20 30 40 50 and 60 m are created from each tested point criterion that 80 of the elevation range is greater than the sample point is set to find the furthest buffer distance impoundment height not exceeding 10 m for the proposed pond is determined based on this distance at the desirable sites impoundment is simulated in the dem creating a ponded area along with a vegetated free board of 1 m acpf identifies a total of 24 potential farm pond practice opportunities covering a 5 drainage area of the plum creek watershed fig 6 shows field scale potential locations for placing wascobs along with depths and farm ponds 3 1 4 riparian assessment acpf places significant emphasis siting riparian practices which provide immense ecological benefits each stream reach is divided into a number of segments 250 m each and catchments corresponding to each segment are delineated fig b 5 of the appendix b represents the riparian catchments delineated for plum creek watershed and the corresponding tile drainage areas the riparian zone within each catchment is defined as a 90 m buffer out from the stream reach related with each catchment the width of the buffers is assessed based on major ecological functions which ranks the riparian zone as high medium or low based on two criteria viz i the potential to provide denitrification of shallow groundwater based on the width of the low lying land 1 5 m within 90 m of the stream and ii total runoff contributing area in the riparian zone of each catchment based on the ranks buffer widths are designed as follows i minimum of a 6 m wide buffer emphasizing on stream bank stability for riparian zones with low runoff and a narrow low lying land zone ii wider buffer 10 90 m consisting of stiff stemmed grasses and multi species buffer to meet the nrcs recommended 0 02 buffer contributing area ratio to trap nutrient and sediment in areas where surface runoff dominates and iii wider buffer with deep rooted vegetation tolerant of saturated soils 25 50 m in sensitive zones dominated with wide low lying land and multispecies buffer to trap nutrients most of the buffers for plum creek watershed include wider zones of low lying land with deep rooted vegetation to promote enhanced denitrification these are riparian attribute polygons raps which represent the relationship between riparian catchment and buffer fig 7 about 18 370 tile acres drain toward riparian catchments for plum creek watershed fig b 6 of the appendix b however the actual amount of tile water discharged into a saturated buffer located in a riparian catchment would depend on the area of cropland drained length of the riparian corridor receiving the diverted drainage and soil site vegetation characteristics riparian attribute polygons raps are identified based on runoff passing through riparian zones and denitrification potential riparian buffers help intercept runoff improve shallow groundwater recharge facilitate growth of saturated buffer vegetation and stabilize stream banks tomer et al 2015 raps deliver a spatial framework to assemble and categorize terrain data on shallow water table and runoff contributing areas acpf sited a total of 736 raps for plum creek watershed ideal zones for riparian management include areas where shallow groundwater and surface runoff can be intercepted in the absence of such conditions benefits such as bank stabilization can be achieved through selection of different buffer species acpf identifies the locations to install saturated buffers which can treat subsurface discharge of tile drainage water jaynes and isenhart 2014 in addition acpf ensures that soils in raps possess high organic content that will act as a substrate for denitrification saturated buffers have the potential to provide up to 55 nutrient load reduction jaynes and isenhart 2014 in addition they provide habitat benefits fig 7 shows 744 riparian buffers that have been identified for plum creek watershed the buffer types sited include stiffed stemmed grass multispecies buffer deep rooted vegetation and stream bank stabilization 3 2 outcomes of ptmapp an exclusive feature of ptmapp is its ability to prioritize and target practice locations that provide measurable water quality benefits at field scale ptmapp can be used for a identifying sources and amount of sediment nitrogen and phosphorus leaving the landscape b targeting specific fields for bmp implementation and c estimating the benefits in terms of downstream load reduction reaching a lake river in a cost effective manner of single or multiple bmps within a watershed ptmapp uses the pourpoints generated by acpf to identify priority resource points the priority resource points are the locations at which tn tp and sediment source loads are routed to and where source load reductions can be summarized for potential practices it also uses the same hydro conditioned dem used for acpf although ptmapp identified 3 priority points for the plum creek watershed for illustration all outcomes of ptmapp are evaluated with respect to one priority point ptmapp assesses sources of sediment tons acre total nitrogen tn lbs acre or total phosphorus tp lbs acre year to priority resource points or watershed outlets fig 8 fig b 7 of the appendix b represents sources of phosphorus the results indicate that many locations from lower watershed contribute sediment nitrogen and phosphorus however the rate of contribution of sediment 0 6 2 2 tons acre year nitrogen 4 26 6 62 lbs acre year and phosphorus 0 23 0 44 lbs acre year to the priority resource point is higher in upper plum creek high sediment and nutrient areas would provide ideal locations for implementing targeted practices however it is essential to first evaluate the feasibility of implementing these strategies using the nrcs field office technical guide fotg potential opportunities for implementing bmps within the watershed is evaluated based on topographic and land use characteristics typical placement and design criteria size of contributing drainage area land slope and flow regime fig 9 represents the targeted locations for structural infiltration biofiltration protection and storage and non structural practices filtration and source reduction ptmapp sited protection and source reduction practices within more than 50 of the watershed practices sited include grassed waterways critical planting areas shoreline protection cover crops and perennial crops storage wascobs drainage management farm ponds and filtration practices grassed waterways filter strips were sited in 15 20 of the watershed area in total ptmapp cited 1483 bmps for plum creek watershed treatment costs in tons or lbs year dollar spent has been evaluated based on annual life cycle costs for various treatment groups given by nrcs eqip payment schedules 2019 table a 2 in the appendix a for plum creek watershed treatment cost for sediment and nitrogen have been represented in fig 10 results indicate that nitrogen treatment using filtration costs between 2 94 and 908 91 lbs year sediment reduction costs also show a wide range between 293 68 and 6659 58 ton year for most of the targeted locations of the watershed similarly treating phosphorus figure now shown due to brevity reasons runoff using grassed waterways critical planting and shoreline restoration costs range between 0 and 10 524 lbs year it is very evident that practically it is not cost effective to install all practices sited by acpf and ptmapp thus ptmapp combines analysis of practice location with pollution reduction and cost effectiveness assessments the criteria suggested by mpca viz i cost effectiveness to reduce sediment 10 000 ton and to reduce tp 10 000 lb as measured at the priority resource point and ii sediment reductions from 2 year 24 hour event 1 ton and tp reductions from 2 year 24 hour event 1 lb have been used based on these criteria out of 1483 bmps delineated by ptmapp only 133 practices were found suitable for priority resource point 1 fig 11 however most of the farmers would adopt only those practices which costs less than 500 year therefore fig 11 represents costs of only those practices a total of 79 which a farmer can adopt suitable practices included storage wascobs drainage management farm ponds or nutrient removal wetlands and protection grassed waterways critical planning or shoreline restoration practices for illustration table 2 represents practices corresponding to some of the locations sediment nutrient load treated and associated cost each of these practices have a catchment i d and co ordinates associated with it which indicate the exact targeted location of these practices within the watershed thus decision makers can generate field scale maps which can aid in landowner outreach and education 3 3 comparison of acpf and ptmapp outcomes for plum creek watershed identifying targeted locations of practices at the field scale is pivotal in developing an effective implementation plan to achieving nutrient and sediment reduction goals the bmps sited by acpf can be placed under various categories of treatment groups suggested by ptmapp fig 12 figs b 8 b 12 in the appendix b compare the sites delineated by acpf and ptmapp for bioreactors grasses waterways and contour buffer strips riparian catchments storage perennials and cover crops for illustration bioreactor locations exhibit some coherence to fair degree however acpf provides a greater number of locations this is because ptmapp considers nutrient loadings in identifying targeted locations while acpf primarily focuses on tile drainage and extensive terrain analysis for filtration practices grassed waterways filter strips both acpf and ptmapp outcomes coincide to good degree greater than80 in addition to grassed waterways acpf also gives locations for contour buffer strips acpf and ptmapp targeted areas for placing protection practices also matched up well greater than70 ptmapp mainly focuses on critical planting areas and shoreline restoration acpf performs a more thorough riparian assessment and delineates zones for deep rooted vegetation multi species buffers stiff stemmed grasses and stream bank stabilization acpf not only analyzes the hydrology but also emphasizes ecological benefits for storage practices wascobs farm ponds nutrient removal wetlands and drainage management only about 50 60 sites identified by ptmapp and acpf are common acpf outcomes are more reliable because the tool performs superior tile drainage and stream network analysis acpf uses minnesota conservation reserve enhancement project crep criteria drainage area ratio buffer area ratio bank height collective flow paths of 60 ha ptmapp outcomes are primarily based on runoff volume and denitrification potential ptmapp sites infiltration practices not accounted for in acpf which include multi stage ditches and infiltration trenches another major difference between the tools is that acpf not only gives targeted sites for practices but also gives details and characteristics of each practice for example in the case of wascobs acpf identifies shape and depth of wascob basins embankment height etc this is critical information for watershed planers and farmers table 3 highlights some of the major differences between ptmapp and acpf in siting bmps based on the results more details are given in table a 3 of the appendix a this table can be used by decision makers or the watershed planners to not only understand the strengths of these tools but also better understand differences observed in their results thus depending upon their objectives planners can use either one of tool or combination of them while acpf offers superior terrain analysis ptmapp is uniquely valuable because it incorporates pollutant loadings and performs cost analyses as discussed in the previous section considering the costs of various treatment groups ptmapp delineates 133 practices which consisted of source reduction and protection practices for the plum creek watershed fig 13 shows a comparison of bmp locations generated using ptmapp and acpf about 70 75 of the sites suggested by these tools are common indicating a strong potential for both of these tools to facilitate development of local watershed plans 3 4 model development incorporate acpf outcomes into ptmapp ptmapp and acpf do more than giving visual representation of the bmp opportunities and each tool has unique strengths ptmapp performs an excellent nutrient and sediment loading assessment and cost analysis in siting the practices and acpf performs superior riparian assessment stream network delineation tile drainage analysis and terrain analysis of dem as a decision maker the best planning and implementation will come from a blended use of these tools a suggested dsf that blends the tools is provided in fig 14 in brief the dsf recommends that planners to incorporate the acpf tool into the ptmapp tool so that acpf practices can be analyzed for nutrient and sediment load efficiencies and so that cost analysis can be performed when acpf practices are incorporated into ptmapp water quality benefits can be estimated this includes pollutants delivered to each of the practices and sediment total phosphorus and total nitrogen removal rates for local watersheds and within larger regions earlier ptmapp and acpf proposed 133 and 729 practices respectively when run separately after incorporating acpf polygons into ptmapp a total of 729 practices are proposed before imposing any restriction on costs however after restricting the cost as suggested by mpca cost effectiveness to reduce sediment 10 000 ton and to reduce tp 10 000 lb as measured at the priority resource point sediment reductions from 2 year 24 hour event 1 ton and tp reductions from 2 year 24 hour event 1 lb 537 practices are delineated much more than ptmapp practices fig 15 by coupling these tools strengths of both tools are utilized to determine the most complete set of water quality planning and implementation information which can be used by farmers and watershed planners table a 4 in the appendix a represents a few of the practices along with the loadings and associated cost obtained by incorporating acpf outcomes into ptmapp 3 5 scenario assessment integrating hspf sam to developed model incorporating acpf polygons into ptmapp provides a valuable dsf in and of itself hspf sam further enhances its value by giving flexibility to decision makers to design and simulate different cost optimized scenarios for achieving tmdls in addition sam has the capability to incorporate farmers viewpoint in the modeling framework three scenarios have been modeled i base scenario representing original condition of plum creek watershed without implementing any practices ii sam scenario 1 finding the reduction in nutrients and sediments in the reach concentration by implementing a set of targeted practices suggested by incorporate acpf ptmapp model and ii sam scenario 2 observing the change in scenario 1 outcomes under severe climatic conditions development and outcomes of sam scenario 1 have been described below using hspf sam several land use changes are designed such as developed forest cropland low till grassland pasture wetland as shown in fig 16 sam divides entire plum creek watershed into 8 sub watersheds for each of the sub watersheds 20 cropland and 20 developed land have been changed to grassland the total changed area in each sub watershed is shown in table 4 in addition to land uses sam gives planners the flexibility to choose bmps from a bmp pool having 24 practices in the plum creek watershed combined use of acpf and ptmapp identified 537 cost effective practices these practices were input into hspf sam to develop various cost optimized scenarios based on tmdl and wraps water quality goals here sam allows watershed planners to incorporate the degree of willingness of the farmers which has a tremendous impact on ranking the bmps for example if a practice has more than 50 suitability based on feasibility criteria cost and its ability to meet water quality goals sam assigns higher rank to that practice however if a farmer is unwilling to adopt that practice despite its other advantageous his opinion is given significant weightage which is incorporated mathematically the tool assesses the feasibility criteria and farmers viewpoints and assigns an optimized rank to the practice which gives a realistic perspective degree of willingness of the farmers has been calculated using a hybridized fuzzy based technique designed by the authors in their previous work srinivas et al 2018 this approach effectively incorporates the uncertain conflicting and diverse opinion of the farmers group towards each practice the results indicate that the degree of willingness ranges between 25 and 50 for most of the practices selected for this study thus the integrated model saves time as well as cost by giving realistic estimate of cost and water quality benefits that can be achieved by implementing practices at field scale table 5 represents the treated area and the total cost year for placing riparian buffers and wascobs in the watershed based on mpca costs scenario 2 has been developed by changing the climatic conditions of scenario 1 to severe to see how the changing climate affects the functioning of the practices fig 17 compare the reach concentration load of sub watershed a187 for all three scenarios similar comparisons have been performed for sediment and phosphorus as well figs b 13 b 15 the percentage reduction in total nitrogen per dollar lbs year achieved after applying scenario 1 has been represented in fig 18 scenario comparison guides the planners to achieve tmdl water quality goals tables 6 8 show how sam helps the planner to evaluate the percentage reduction achieved in total phosphorus by running sam scenario 1 table 6 sets the total phosphorus lbs day tmdls for various sub watersheds in plum creek watershed whereas table 7 represents the total phosphorus for the base scenario and scenario 1 table 8 represents the reduction needed and that achieved by scenario 1 the results guide the decision maker to select a greater number of cost efficient practices in order to achieve the phosphorus reduction goal 3 5 1 estimating optimized practices based on budget and farmer s opinion it is essential to rank the practices while striking a balance between achieving tmdls cost and farmer s viewpoint for example scenario 1 costs 362 472 for achieving an overall 15 nitrogen reduction in sub watershed a185 with the practices suggested by acpf ptmapp model in the case of plum creek watershed the budget has been fixed to 250 000 to achieve 15 overall nitrogen reduction based on cost availability and farmers preferences based on optimized budget the ranks of 26 preferred practices have been represented in table 9 the results indicate that with this budget an 8 5 nitrogen reduction can be achieved the progress to target of 15 column indicates the percentage contribution from each practice to reach the 8 5 nitrogen reduction with fixed budget for illustration filter strips 50 ft wide cropland field edge helps in achieving 0 376 reduction in nitrogen such realistic estimate of water quality improvement saves immense cost and time of the modelers and planners without optimization there were more than 75 cost effective practices suggested for this sub watershed thus a lot of time and cost that could have been invested in planning and designing these practices have been saved using the integrated framework developed in this study the results show that using only one model would not be cost effective as it will lead to either delineation of too less or too many practices at the field scale due to absence of optimization component fig 19 summarizes the costs and number of practices for a sub watershed a185 delineated by each of the models as well the integrated framework using ptmapp alone there will be only 15 practices 153 022 which offers less variety of practices moreover farmer s viewpoint is not incorporated by ptmapp while delineating these practices only using hspf sam appears cost effective but it doesn t site the field scale locations of the practices no doubt acpf and acpf ptmapp models do give focused field scale siting of practices the number of practices and costs are high 73 and 1 261 330 the broad variety of practices delineated by acpf ptmapp model would surely offer more flexibility to the farmers but the top choices of the model are not always preferred by the farmers the integration of hspf sam in the modeling framework effectively addresses this issue by modifying the ranks of practices and filtering out least preferred practices based on the available budget and farmer s opinion the integrated framework highlighted in fig 19 helps in savings cost time and resources as it provides a mix of 26 practices 250 000 while including farmer s opinion in the decision process thus all the three watershed models namely ptmapp acpf and hspf sam contribute equally fig 20 towards development of optimized and flexible scenario based framework that can be communicated to the landowners along with field scale maps 4 conclusions this study develops a novel dsf for field scale analysis of agricultural conservation practices using three advanced watershed modeling tools acpf ptmapp and hspf sam the outcomes of integrated model aimed to bridge the gap between modeling at watershed scale and implementation at field scale by coupling critical components of these watershed tools watershed planning and implementation decisions can be made in a simpler faster more accurate and cost effective manner bmp opportunities can also be more effectively discussed with local farmers and other stakeholders use of hdm3 hydro conditioned dem was critical to obtaining successful results specifically the loading and cost analysis provided by ptmapp the stream network delineation tile drainage terrain analysis and riparian assessment of acpf and the optimized scenario development aspect of hspf sam have been utilized in the dsf application of the proposed dsf in the plum creek watershed showed promising results ptmapp alone identified only 133 cost effective practices however when acpf practices were incorporated into ptmapp the combined outcome was the siting of 537 cost effective practices as well as an estimate of nutrient and sediment load reductions adding hspf sam allowed planners to analyze bmp opportunities using a defined budget set watershed pollutant load reduction goals and change climate conditions scenario analysis in plum creek with a set budget of 250 000 only showed an 8 5 nitrogen reduction the dsf delineates field scale practices while incorporating the conflicting viewpoints of the farmers which leads to a more realistic tmdl assessment this dsf can facilitate field scale planning of any huc 12 watershed provided input data requirements are fulfilled future work should express how to communicate field scale maps to landowners it is believed that this study captures the importance of procuring more accurate and precise field specific data for better field scale estimations and ultimately better practice implementation credit authorship contribution statement r srinivas

5687,drywells are widely used as managed aquifer recharge devices to capture stormwater runoff and recharge groundwater but little research has examined the role of subsurface heterogeneity in hydraulic properties on drywell recharge efficiency numerical experiments were therefore conducted on a 2d axisymmetric domain using the hydrus 2d 3d software to systematically study the influence of various homogenous soil types and subsurface heterogeneity on recharge from drywells under constant head conditions the mean cumulative infiltration μi and recharge μr volumes increased with an increase in the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s for various homogeneous soils subsurface heterogeneity was described by generating ten stochastic realizations of soil hydraulic properties with selected standard deviation σ and horizontal x and vertical z correlation lengths after 365 days values of μi μr and the radius of the recharge area increased with σ and x but decreased with z the value of μr was always smaller for a homogeneous than a heterogeneous domain this indicates that recharge for a heterogeneous profile cannot be estimated with an equivalent homogeneous profile the value of μr was always smaller than μi and correlations were highly non linear due to vadose zone storage knowledge of only infiltration volume can therefore lead to misinterpretation of recharge efficiency especially at earlier times the arrival time of the wetting front at the bottom boundary 60 m ranged from 21 to 317 days with earlier times occurring for increasing σ and z the corresponding first arrival location can be 0 1 44 m away from the bottom releasing point of a drywell in the horizontal direction with greater distances occurring for increasing σ and x this knowledge is important to accurately assess drywell recharged performance water quantity and water quality keywords drywell infiltration recharge arrival time arrival location hydrus 2d 3d 1 introduction the world economic forum lists freshwater scarcity as the largest global risk to the sustainable development of human society due to the increasing demand of the world population and expansion of irrigated agriculture ercin and hoekstra 2014 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 vorosmarty et al 2000 spatial and temporal variations in water demand lead to water scarcity in several parts of the world during specific times of the year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 postel et al 1996 savenije 2000 water resources can be divided into renewable e g surface water and groundwater and non renewable

of groundwater resources has resulted in groundwater depletion increased pollution land subsidence soil salinization and seawater intrusion in parts of the world feng et al 2013 urban development with impermeable and paved surfaces leads to reduced infiltration of runoff water and extreme flooding events but also offers opportunities to capture and store excess runoff and recharge groundwater increased flooding from climate extremes also provides opportunities for collecting storing and injecting stormwater into an aquifer for use during droughts scanlon et al 2016 sustainable utilization of water resources can be achieved by reducing the demand for groundwater through increased water use efficiency conjunctive use of alternative water sources or increasing recharge dillon 2005 stormwater capture infiltration and recharge technologies such as infiltration basins vadose zone infiltration devices like drywells edwards et al 2016 sasidharan et al 2018a sasidharan et al 2019 infiltration trenches stormwater wells and direct injection wells dillon 2005 gale 2005 richard and peter 2017 have been developed over the last 60 years the main focuses of all these managed aquifer recharge strategies are to prevent flooding and surface and groundwater pollution enhance drought resilience with short term coping strategies and long term adaptive capacity and increase groundwater recharge dillon et al 2019 scanlon et al 2016 washington state department of ecology 2006 a few major cities in california and washington achieve nearly 70 100 percent of their groundwater recharge through stormwater drainage wells or drywell infiltration cadmus 1999 epa 1999 similarly rapidly developing urban areas in arizona florida and texas are planning to continue to build stormwater wells as a cost effective way to manage runoff and to recharge groundwater cadmus 1999 epa 1999 accurate estimation of groundwater recharge remains a challenge in the field of hydrology due to its nonlinear nature which varies with space and time wang et al 2016 traditionally both physical water balance darcy flux root zone drainage and chemical tracers approaches have been used to estimate recharge in arid and semi arid areas allison et al 1994 however these techniques are expensive not useful for short term measurement and exhibit large errors hendrickx and walker 2017 huang et al 2017 in addition spatial variability in local topography soil texture and structure produce heterogeneity in groundwater recharge that requires a large number of sampling locations allison et al 1994 limited field measurements are increasingly used in combination with vadose zone numerical modeling as a time and cost effective method to estimate groundwater recharge min et al 2015 ries et al 2015 small 2005 turkeltaub et al 2015 wang et al 2016 however most of these studies only considered root zone soil moisture deep vadose zone soil water content and matric pressure data to determine the average soil hydraulic parameters for the vadose zone to a maximum depth of 1 20 m furthermore these investigations have shown large differences in groundwater recharge and simulated data due to uncertainty in model parameters soil heterogeneity such as the presence of high and low permeable soil layers their horizontal and vertical distribution and connectivity significantly impacts water flow in the subsurface mantoglou and gelhar 1987 schilling et al 2017 xie et al 2014 yeh et al 1985a b inadequate characterization of subsurface heterogeneity can lead to uncertainty in the prediction of water flow through the vadose zone contaminant migration and estimation of recharge deterministic and stochastic models can be used to study water flow in the vadose zone and groundwater recharge from a drywell the miller and miller 1956 similitude scaling approach is a stochastic model that has been widely used to analyze flow and transport processes in heterogeneous unsaturated soil systems hammel and roth 1998 roth 1995 roth and hammel 1996 tseng and jury 1994 vereecken et al 2007 our previous study investigated the influence of stochastic vadose zone heterogeneity on drywell infiltration behavior and determined the effective unsaturated soil hydraulic properties sasidharan et al 2019 most previous infiltration and recharge studies have looked at the long term steady state conditions when infiltration below the root zone equals recharge gray and norum 1967 mantoglou and gelhar 1987 yeh et al 1985a b however the installation of a new drywell that receives episodic water input will create transient conditions in the vadose zone that will change infiltration recharge and storage in this case infiltration will be greater than recharge until a new steady state condition is achieved transient recharge behavior is important for drywells because during their typical operational lifespan e g a decade they may not ever achieve steady state conditions however no literature has investigated the effect of subsurface heterogeneity on groundwater recharge from a drywell under constant head conditions which is an upper bound best case scenario for recharge and worst case scenario for contaminant transport one of the major selling points for drywells compared to direct injection wells is the opportunity for vadose zone treatment of contaminants edwards et al 2016 current regulatory standards for drywells only require 1 5 13 m separation distance between the bottom of the drywell and the local groundwater table city of portland 2008 2015 epa 1999 washington state department of ecology 2006 however many previous studies using microbial contaminants like viruses sasidharan et al 2018b sasidharan et al 2017a schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 and bacteria camesano and logan 1998 johnson et al 1995 sasidharan et al 2017b demonstrated that microbial retention and inactivation is a function of the flow velocity and residence time soil profiles with high permeability or preferential flow paths arnaud et al 2015 bradford et al 2017 can lead to the early arrival of pathogenic microbes at the water table in addition monitoring wells to characterize recharge water quality are usually installed within a few meters of a drywell hamad et al 2016 izuka 2011 this implicitly assumes that the arrival of recharge water occurs directly below the bottom of the drywell in many cases drinking water supply wells have been contaminated or threatened by water infiltrated from drywells i e stormwater drainage wells haney et al 1989 varying degrees contamination of groundwater by stormwater drainage wells has been reported across the us cadmus 1991 1996 1999 haney et al 1989 michael 1997 orr 1993 usepa 1997 wilde 1994 therefore an understanding of the influence of subsurface heterogeneity on the arrival time and location of recharge during the short term operation of a drywell is essential when assessing water quality the objective of this study is to investigate the influence of subsurface heterogeneity on groundwater recharge from a drywell especially the short term condition when recharge does not yet equal infiltration the hydrus 2d 3d software was used to directly simulate cumulative infiltration and recharge volumes from a drywell for different homogenous and heterogeneous soils constant head conditions were considered in the drywell to facilitate the determination of subsurface soil properties on the upper limit for recharge and contaminant transport and the lower limit on arrival time subsurface heterogeneity was described in this model by generating stochastic realizations of soil hydraulic properties with selected standard deviation and vertical and horizontal correlation lengths the influence of stochastic subsurface heterogeneity parameters on cumulative infiltration i and recharge r volumes the radius of recharge rx early eat and late lat arrival times and early eap and late lap arrival points were determined to understand the drywell infiltration and recharge behavior in the deep vadose zone 60 m 2 materials and methods 2 1 mathematical model this research explores the role of subsurface heterogeneities on recharge from a drywell using numerical experiments input parameters initial conditions and boundary conditions that were employed in these numerical experiments were generally based on results from drywells located in fort irwin ca that are discussed in the supporting information si the hydrus 2d 3d software package version 3 šejna et al 2018 šimůnek et al 2018 2016 was used to simulate infiltration from the drywell redistribution in the vadose zone and recharge into the groundwater hydrus 2d 3d numerically solves the 2 dimensional axisymmetric form of richards equation using the van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 unsaturated soil hydraulic functions unless otherwise stated default values of hydraulic parameters e g the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks the shape parameter in the soil water retention function α the residual soil water content θr the saturated soil water content θs the pore size distribution parameter in the soil water retention function n and the tortuosity parameter in the hydraulic conductivity function l for various soil textural classes were taken from the hydrus 2d 3d soil catalog carsel and parrish 1988 šejna et al 2014 fig 1 shows a schematic of an example simulation flow domain drywell geometry initial condition boundary conditions and scale of the domain the drywell geometry employed in this study was adapted from a maxwell iv model torrents resources phoenix arizona usa drywell dw2 installed at the fort irwin study site see section 1 in si the complex geometry of the drywell and the dynamics of the water flow from the drywell is described in detail by sasidharan et al 2018a the drywell has a size of 36 m height h 1 8 m width w a 60 m h 50 m w simulation flow domain was chosen to best capture the infiltration radius of the drywell to account for the drywell depth and to accurately estimate the arrival time of the recharge water and rate fig 1 the simulation domain was discretized using a two dimensional triangular finite element mesh with the meshgen tool available within hydrus 2d 3d šejna et al 2014 the mesh was refined at the left part of the domain where infiltration from the drywell was simulated to reduce the mass balance error the finite element mesh was adjusted such that the size of elements was smaller 0 05 0 1 m near the drywell and the grid size was gradually increased with radial distance from the drywell with a maximum element size of 0 5 0 75 m the quality of the finite element mesh was assessed by checking the mass balance error reported by hydrus 2d 3d at the end of the simulation mass balance errors were always below 1 and these values are generally considered acceptable brunetti et al 2017 a no flux boundary condition was assigned to the upper boundary the nodes representing the right and lower left the boundary between the drywell and the bottom boundary sides of the flow domain were set to no flux boundaries the nodes at the bottom boundary z 60 m were assigned a free drainage boundary condition i e the water table was assumed to be far below this point note that the numerical experiments in this study do not account for the effect of the water table and future site specific analysis and modeling studies are therefore warranted justification for the constant head condition is given in section 1 of the si to represent a continuously full drywell the total head h h z at the left boundary at z 8 to 38 was constant and equal to 0 m i e the pressure head decreased linearly with depth from 38 m at the bottom boundary of the drywell to 8 at the top fig 1 the initial condition ic in the flow domain was specified in terms of the soil water pressure head h x z and was set to a constant pressure head of 0 5 m fig 1 this initial condition is justified because the bottom of the drywell at fort irwin is approximately 25 m from the water table in addition the water retention curve for the fort irwin soil fig s4 shows that at 50 cm pressure head the corresponding water content 0 06 is close to the residual water content 0 043 table 1 of the fort irwin soil therefore we choose this relatively low ics to make the change in storage smaller and to estimate recharge accurately within the simulation time 3 numerical experiments 3 1 homogeneous domain numerical experiments experiment i table 1 were conducted to determine the values of i r and rx under the sand s loamy sand ls sandy loam sl loam l and silt si soil materials for 365 days 1 year a homogeneous flow domain was considered in these simulations and the hydraulic parameters for various soil textures were taken from the hydrus 2d 3d soil catalog table 1 the value of i was collected over time during the simulation as the total volume of water infiltrated from the full drywell i e the constant total head boundary similarly the value of r was calculated as the volume of water drained through the bottom free drainage boundary the radius of recharge was calculated from the saturated nodes and its corresponding distance in the x direction at the bottom boundary of the flow domain note that all this information was available in output files of the hydrus 2d 3d software 3 2 heterogeneous domain the previous experiment considered idealized homogeneous soil systems however most field scale soil profiles are highly heterogeneous as shown in the fort irwin case study section 1 in si and the hydraulic parameters may change over short distances natural geologic processes tend to produce layers and lenses in soil texture that form parallel to the soil surface phillips and lorz 2008 in addition preferential water flow pathways can occur in the vertical direction as a result of unstable flow behavior dynamic capillary properties macropores from decaying plant roots burrowing earthworms and animals spatial variations in soil structure and cracks in clayey soils and fractured rocks flury et al 1994 hencher et al 2011 hendrickx and flury 2001 phillips and lorz 2008 sidle et al 2000 smith et al 2008 uchida et al 2003 usda 2016 this study did not explicitly investigate the effect of preferential flow pathways and macropores which has been extensively explored in previous research kung 1990 larsbo et al 2005 nativ et al 1995 šimůnek and bradford 2008 wood et al 1997 several approaches such as univariate multivariate and multiple point geostatistical techniques can be used to represent geometrical features and quantify soil variability elkateb et al 2003 jackson and caldwell 1993 meerschman et al 2013 in this study high permeable horizontal and vertical soil layers lenses are represented using the miller miller similitude geostatistical approach which has been widely used in previous research feyen et al 1998 roth 1995 roth and hammel 1996 sasidharan et al 2019 vereecken et al 2007 the original miller miller concept of scaling is based on using the scaling factor to adjust the degree of magnification or reduction of the ks and h relative to a standard reference value šimůnek et al 2012 the hydrus 2d 3d computer software has an option to generate stochastic distributions of hydraulic conductivity α k and pressure head α h scaling factors using the miller miller similitude approximation miller and miller 1956 which links these two scaling factors as follows α k α h 2 in this study lognormal distribution for the scaling factors were employed šimůnek et al 2007 three input parameters the standard deviation σ of log10 α k and its correlation length in the lateral the x correlation length x and vertical the z correlation length z directions were used to generate the stochastic field the value of σ determines the extent of variations in the scaling factors with higher values leading to higher variations in scaling factors the correlation length is a measure of how similar the scaling factors are in a specific direction and to what distance a high value of the x correlation length means that the scaling factor maintains similar values for a greater horizontal distance the same applies to the z correlation length in the vertical direction rassam et al 2003 procedures for generating autocorrelated or uncorrelated scaling factor fields and the original algorithm used in hydrus have been described in detail in the literature el kadi 1986 freeze 1975 mejía and rodríguez iturbe 1974 soil hydraulic parameters ks α θr θs and n for stochastic simulations were obtained from experiments conducted at the fort irwin site experiment ii table 1 in particular inverse optimization of falling head experimental data was used to obtain ks and α sasidharan et al 2018a whereas other parameters θr θs and n were obtained from the measured particle size distribution silt clay fraction and the rosetta software schaap et al 2001 segal et al 2009 constant head drywell simulations in heterogeneous domains were used to determine i and r after 365 days multiple realizations of the stochastic parameters were employed to determine mean values of i μi and r μr and associated standard deviations the computational time and cost to conduct these recharge simulations were large to minimize these factors only ten realizations were considered for each stochastic heterogeneity parameter combination the justification for using 10 realizations is given in our previous research sasidharan et al 2019 in particular these authors found that the mean and standard deviation of cumulative infiltration volume in heterogeneous soil profiles stabilized after around ten realizations for stochastic parameters considered in the present study in this study the following hypothetical combinations of the scaling factors with variable σ σ 0 25 0 5 1 when x 1 m and z 0 1 m x x 0 1 1 10 m when σ 1 and z 0 1 m and z z 0 1 1 2 m when σ 1 and x 1 were used similar parameter ranges have been measured in the field freeze 1975 sudicky and macquarrie 1989 and employed in previous modeling studies sasidharan et al 2019 in addition a simulation for a homogenous domain with the fort irwin soil hydraulic parameters was conducted to compare the μi and μr between homogeneous and heterogeneous domains the times when the first i e early arrival time eat and last i e late arrival time lat bottom boundary nodes got saturated for the first and last times were extracted from the output data file with nodal water contents from each hydrus 2d 3d simulation similarly the first i e the early arrival point eap and last i e the late arrival point lap bottom boundary nodes that were saturated were also calculated a mean radius of recharge rx was calculated as the distance in the x direction between the first and last nodes at the bottom boundary that were fully saturated at the end of the 365 days simulation mean parameter values and 95 confidence intervals ci were calculated for all parameters from ten simulations 4 result and discussions 4 1 homogeneous soil profiles numerical experiments were conducted to better understand the transient relationship between the cumulative infiltration and recharge volumes in homogeneous soil domains simulations considered higher permeability soils e g s ls sl l and si that are generally used for vadose zone infiltration devices fig 2 a and b show simulated water content θ profiles in various soils e g s ls sl l and si after 0 73 and 365 days respectively fig 3 presents corresponding information about the infiltration and recharge behavior in these same simulations the width and depth of the cone of infiltration after 0 73 days fig 2a decreases with a decrease in the soil ks in the order s ls sl l and si table 1 similarly the value of i as a function of time increases with the soil ks fig 3a the recharge at a specific time depends on changes in the soil hydraulic properties with θ van genuchten et al 1991 and the radius of the cone of infiltration at the bottom boundary rx yeh et al 1985a and yeh et al 1985b demonstrated that the variability of capillary pressure or moisture content increases when the mean capillary pressure increases and the anisotropy ratio vertical horizontal of the effective unsaturated ks increases when the mean capillary pressure increases or mean moisture content decreases coarser soils e g sand with larger pore sizes have lower θ and k θ hydraulic conductivity at varying water saturation values before the wetting front arrives fig s5a consequently the background θ fig 2 and the initial recharge rate fig 3b is lower in coarser than finer textured soils however coarser soils also have higher values of k θ when θ approaches saturated conditions fig s5b the wetting front therefore arrives at the bottom boundary faster in coarser than finer textured soils in 0 8 days for sand compared to 16 7 days for silt and this is associated with a dramatic increase in r fig 3b and rx fig 3c at the end of the simulation 365 days the cones of infiltration fig 2b are similar and rx 21 5 m fig 3c for various soil types and the final value of r increases with the soil ks fig 3b fig 3d shows plots of i versus r at 365 day for the simulations in various soils note that a large volume of water needs to infiltrate into the soil before recharge from the drywell rapidly increases furthermore this delay in recharge increases for coarser textured soils that have lower background values of θ for example recharge rapidly increased when i 9526 m3 for sand compared to i 1896 m3 for silt this occurs because infiltrating water needs to fill more of the pore space in coarser lower initial θ than in finer textured soils before the cone of infiltration can reach the bottom boundary these simulation results will be sensitive to the model s initial conditions in this work we have assumed an initial head of 0 5 m throughout the domain note that the simulated i 1896 9526 m3 can have a resemblance to an actual arid or semi arid site like fort irwin which received 515 m3 input water from irrigation runoff during 200 days monitoring period summer 4 2 heterogeneous soil profiles 4 2 1 cumulative infiltration and recharge the above simulations were highly idealized because they considered homogeneous soil profiles in contrast natural subsurface is inherently heterogeneous however previous studies hencher et al 2011 phillips and lorz 2008 sasidharan et al 2019 sidle et al 2000 smith et al 2008 uchida et al 2003 usda 2016 and the case study presented in the si demonstrates that layered soil structures are very common illustrative simulations were therefore conducted to better understand the effects of stochastic heterogeneity parameters x z and σ for ks on the cumulative infiltration and recharge volumes from a drywell figs 4 and 5 show representative h and θ distributions respectively after 365 days constant head simulation in homogeneous figs 2a and 3a and stochastic figs 2b h and 3b h domains the fort irwin soil hydraulic parameters experiment ii table 1 were employed in these simulations and stochastic parameters equaled x 10 m z 0 1 m and σ 1 in fig 4b and 5b x 1 m z 0 1 m and σ 1 in figs 4c and 5c x 0 1 m z 0 1 m and σ 1 in figs 4d and 5d x 1 m z 1 m and σ 1 in figs 4e and 5e x 1 m z 2 m and σ 1 in figs 4f and 5f x 1 m z 0 1 m and σ 0 5 in figs 4g and 5g and x 1 m z 0 1 m and σ 0 25 in figs 4h and 5h heterogeneous domains display wider distributions in the lateral direction of the saturated area and the presence of unsaturated pockets within the cone of infiltration compared to a homogeneous domain figs 4a and 5a fig 6 shows values of μi and μr and their 95 ci after 365 days as a function of σ fig 6a x fig 6b and z fig 6c specific stochastic parameters that were employed in these simulations included σ 0 25 0 5 and 1 when x 1 m and z 0 1 m in fig 6a x 0 1 1 10 m when z 0 1 m and σ 1 in fig 6b and z 0 1 1 2 m when x 1 m and σ 1 in fig 6c fig 6 also includes values of i and r after 365 days for the corresponding homogeneous domain a comparison of results for homogeneous and heterogeneous simulations reveals that both infiltration and recharge were higher for heterogeneous domains consequently simulations that employ a homogenous domain will always underestimate the actual infiltration and recharge efficiency of a drywell the heterogeneous simulations indicate that the value of μr will always be smaller than μi during the short term experiment this revealed that over the 365 days simulation period not all infiltrated water will recharge groundwater because some of the water will be trapped in isolated pockets or high permeable regions surrounded by low permeable layers figs 4 and 5 the distribution and volume of trapped water in the flow domain will be highly dependent on the subsurface heterogeneity fig 6 shows that μi and μr tended to increase with σ fig 6a and x fig 6b but decreased with z fig 6c due to differences in the water distribution figs 4 and 5 fig 7 shows a similar dependence of the mean value of rx at the bottom boundary on σ fig 7a x fig 7b and z fig 7c an increase in σ leads to the formation of more permeable regions which enhance infiltration fig 6a recharge fig 6a and spreading fig 7a similarly an increase in x produces larger lateral lenses with high permeability that enhance the rapid movement of the wetting front in the horizontal direction fig 5d c and b and facilitate the infiltration and recharge of water over a larger area figs 6b and 7b conversely an increase in z creates larger vertical lenses with high permeability which facilitates the rapid vertical movement of water over a relatively small area fig 5e f 6c and 7c the 95 cis for μi and μr were sometimes very large in fig 6 especially for the highest values of x and z in fig 6b and c respectively this uncertainty reflects differences in the continuity of the high permeability regions and the area of recharge fig 7 several other studies have reported extensive lateral horizontal moisture movement but a limited vertical movement in different systems mantoglou and gelhar 1987 routson et al 1979 sinai et al 1974 yeh et al 1985a b however these general findings only give information regarding the long term trend of infiltration and recharge and do not consider the presence of high permeable horizontally and vertically correlated soil layers therefore it is important to understand the infiltration and recharge behavior the arrival time and arrival location during short term drywell operation to establish a site specific monitoring system 4 2 2 time and location of recharge the drywell regulatory guidelines require a mandatory separation distance of only 1 5 13 m between the drywell and the local groundwater table to provide a contaminant treatment zone city of portland 2008 city of portland 2015 epa 1999 washington state department of ecology 2006 however soils with highly permeable vertical lenses or fractures could minimize the contaminant treatment time and can produce an early arrival of contaminants such as pathogenic microbes to groundwater bradford et al 2017 mohanty et al 2016 wang et al 2014a b figs 4 7 examined infiltration and recharge from a drywell in heterogeneous and homogeneous soils after 365 days under constant head conditions values of the mean final recharge rate μr and mean rx in fig 7 can be used to estimate the average yearly recharge flux to groundwater from a drywell i e μr divided by πrx 2 for a constant head condition fig s6 this information is vital for determining the average yearly darcy velocity during recharge for conservatively transported contaminants during recharge however it does not address variability in the recharge behavior with time or the location on the bottom boundary simulation results were therefore further evaluated to address these issues this information has important implications for properly determining times and locations for assessing the potential migration of contaminants through the vadose zone to the groundwater table fig 8 provides summary information about recharge with time and location for stochastic simulations when x 1 m z 0 1 m and σ 0 25 0 5 and 1 the early eat and late lat mean arrival times decreased with σ in fig 8a and b respectively however the mean location for early eap and late lap arrival point increased with σ fig 8c and d observed differences in the early and late arrival times and points can be explained by analyzing the μr data with time fig 8e and f there was a significant delay in recharge when σ 0 25 compared to higher σs fig 8e and the value of μr was very close to that for the homogeneous soil at 365 days fig 8 a small value of σ leads to a more uniform and lower permeability and a cone of infiltration that takes longer to fill before the wetting front arrives at the bottom boundary an increase in σ creates more high permeability zones that decrease the early and late arrival times it also increases the spreading of water figs 4h g d and 7a and thereby increases the distance to the early and late arrival points interestingly all 4 parameters eat lat eap lap showed a large 95 cis due to differences in the predicted water distributions fig 9 provides summary information about recharge with time and location for stochastic simulations when z 0 1 m σ 1 and x 0 1 1 10 m fig 9a d show values of eat lat eap and lap respectively and their corresponding 95 cis that increase with the x correlation length these trends reflect increasing water spreading with x due to larger lenses in the lateral direction with high permeability fig 9e and f show values of μr as a function of time during early i e 75 days and late i e 365 days stages respectively early stages of recharge show a decrease in μr with an increase in x because recharge is delayed by increasing lateral spreading this trend is consistent with the results displayed in fig 9a d conversely μr was greatest when x 10 m at later stages of recharge fig 9f this suggests that vertical migration and recharge was enhanced once larger horizontal lenses with higher permeability were filled in this case higher values of θ and k θ were achieved in high permeability lenses that enhanced recharge previous researchers have similarly reported that the vertical effective ks is small and the lateral effective ks is large in the wetting front of stratified soil mantoglou and gelhar 1987 which increased the lateral movement of contaminants in the unsaturated zone below various waste disposal facilities crosby iii et al 1968 crosby iii et al 1971 palmquist and johnson 1962 price et al 1979 prill 1977 enhanced lateral movement can be attributed to the fact that at high tension the hydraulic conductivity of fine textured materials is relatively high and water may prefer to spread laterally in a fine bed than to move vertically through coarser ones routson et al 1979 in natural environments layered soil profiles with high permeable sand layers followed by low permeable clay lenses with extensions and thicknesses of several tens to hundreds of meters can be present phillips and lorz 2008 trautwein et al 1983 investigated wastewater movement from an evaporation pond in the stratified unsaturated zone and observed that the contamination pool extended laterally to a distance of 2000 m due to the formation of a saturated perched water zone above the water table the presence of such geological formations e g clay layer at fort irwin si could delay groundwater recharge from a drywell from 1 to 100 years therefore the presence of a high permeable soil around the drywell infiltration area may not contribute to groundwater recharge for many years fig 10 provides summary information about recharge with time and location for stochastic simulations when x 1 m σ 1 and z 0 1 1 and 2 m fig 10a and b show that the values of eat and lat respectively decreased with z conversely values of eap and lap increased fig 10c and decreased fig 10d with z fig 10e shows that values of μr during the early stage 75 days increased with z among all stochastic parameter combinations the x 1 z 2 σ 1 simulation had the earliest arrival time 34 12 days the presence of highly permeable vertical lenses facilitates the faster downward movement of water and thus an early arrival time fig 10a however the value of μr during the late stage 365 days was greatest when z 0 1 m and lowest when z 2 m fig 10f in this case the presence of a thick vertical lens fig 10f when z 2 m reduced the overall width of the cone of infiltration figs 4 and 5 and the recharge area fig 7 and this decreased the long term value of μr all 4 parameters showed a large 95 cis for simulations shown in fig 10 and this reflects the variability in water distributions and flow rates groundwater monitoring wells are commonly installed a few meters away from a drywell hamad et al 2016 izuka 2011 previous stochastic theory studies mantoglou and gelhar 1987 yeh et al 1985a b predicts that a contamination plume tends to spread laterally in dry vadose zone soils while vertical movement is slow contaminants may therefore arrive at the water table much later than is predicted by many classic one dimensional models however this study demonstrated that the arrival time could range from 33 to 317 days and the arrival location could be 0 1 44 m away from the bottom releasing point of a drywell depending on the heterogeneity if the location of a monitoring well and the sampling timing are not properly selected then the recharge water quality can lead to a misinterpretation of the anticipated transport and risks from contaminants consequently the use of model projections for estimating the magnitude of groundwater recharge and transport of contaminants from drywells in heterogeneous subsurface conditions will likely have a high degree of uncertainty one should therefore be cautious when determining the risks from drywells during the short term operation at a site that is not thoroughly characterized based on the modeling realizations the value of μr was always smaller for a homogeneous than a heterogeneous domain figs 8f 9f and 10f previously sasidharan et al 2018a found that an equivalent homogeneous soil domain could be used to accurately predict μi for a heterogeneous soil domain the sensitivity of a modeled recharge volume to various physical configurations and connectivity of soil hydraulic properties implies that measurement of the soil heterogeneity below the drywell is an important consideration when evaluating the potential for groundwater recharge as shown in fig s7 the correlation between drywell infiltration and the recharge volume can be highly non linear for heterogeneous soil domains thus model estimates of short or long term recharge efficiencies may not be reliable when constrained solely by the inferred volume of infiltration based on empirical measurements within a drywell system 5 conclusions and future implications drywells are widely used to capture stormwater and convey it to the vadose zone for subsequent groundwater recharge however assessing the performance of a drywell and its recharge efficiency over the short or long term is very tedious time consuming expensive and complex to successfully install a drywell conduct groundwater monitoring and collect accurate groundwater quality information requires a careful design of field experiments and a knowledge of the subsurface heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties numerical experiments were conducted to understand the relationship between the cumulative infiltration and recharge volumes in the homogeneous s ls sl l and si soil domains the cumulative infiltration and recharge volumes increased with ks during the initial stages of infiltration the coarser textured sandy soil had a lower background θ and therefore a large volume of water had to infiltrate before the recharge rate from the drywell rapidly increased the wetting front arrived at the bottom boundary faster in coarser than finer textured soils however all soil types had a similar value of the recharge area radius at the end of the simulation note that this may not occur when the model is run with a more representative transient loading condition groundwater monitoring well installations placed at the outer radius of the recharge area may therefore not be the best choice homogeneous soil profiles are highly idealized conditions compared to natural subsurface soils that are highly heterogeneous therefore additional numerical experiments were conducted to better understand the influence of stochastic heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties on drywell infiltration and recharge behavior the cumulative infiltration and recharge volume after a 365 days constant head simulation were higher for heterogeneous domains than for the homogeneous domain however the cumulative recharge volume was smaller than the cumulative infiltration volume and their correlations were highly non linear this result indicates that a fraction of infiltrated water can be trapped in isolated pockets or highly permeable regions in the vadose zone and the knowledge of the infiltration volume under varying stormwater flow events may not be a reliable predictor of potential short term recharge both cumulative infiltration and recharge increased with increasing σ and the lateral correlation length but decreased with an increasing vertical correlation length the radius of recharge at the bottom boundary showed a similar dependency on stochastic parameters the mean early and late arrival times decreased with σ whereas the mean early and late arrival points increased with σ an increase in σ creates more high permeability and connectivity zones and increases the spreading of water the values of both early and late arrival times and locations increased with the x correlation length the presence of larger highly permeable lateral lenses increases the spreading of water at the same time values of early and late arrival times decreased with the z correlation length in contrast early and late arrival locations increased and decreased with z respectively the presence of highly permeable vertical lenses facilitates the faster downward moment of water but reduces the overall width of the cone of filtration and the recharge area this research points out that the assumption of a highly permeable homogenous soil around the drywell may result in unrealistic model estimates of recharge to groundwater some understanding of the hydraulic properties subsurface heterogeneity and its continuity between the drywell and the groundwater table is essential for making an informed decision on recharge and contaminant transport the current drywell infiltration tests performed by contractors are very simple and fail to capture accurately the hydraulic behavior of a site therefore carefully planned falling head and constant head multiple cycles experiment should be conducted in a newly installed drywell and effective hydraulic properties can be obtained by the inverse optimization of the observed data sasidharan et al 2018a 2019 in the absence of extensive knowledge about the subsurface heterogeneity an equivalent homogeneous domain with inversely optimized stochastic parameters can be used to estimate the cumulative infiltration sasidharan et al 2019 even if such an analysis may not provide an accurate estimation of recharge under transient conditions this research demonstrated the importance of subsurface heterogeneity on recharge from drywells however it is important to recognize the limitations and assumptions employed in this study the consideration of heterogeneous subsurface and subsequent data analysis can be time consuming and adds a lot more complexity for example a maximum x correlation length of 10 m was considered in this study due to the limitation in the size of the model simulation domain size and the associated simulation time and cost the stochastic input parameters used in the numerical experiments were hypothetical since site specific data is not available and initial and boundary conditions were chosen based on the limited knowledge available from fort irwin s study site it is recommended that hydrogeologists drywell practitioners and regulators implement new strategies during drywell installation to collect detailed site specific subsurface heterogeneity data for future validation studies for example drywell performance could be assessed using single or multiple slanted boreholes that are instrumented with water content probes and solution sampling ports at several depths to track water content profiles and contaminant migration respectively dahan et al 2009 such information can help to quantify the influence of subsurface heterogeneity on recharge and serve as an early warning system of contaminant migration in the vadose zone dahan et al 2009 in addition a variety of near surface geophysical techniques can provide valuable information on site structure hydrology and hydrogeology and contamination plume information annan 2005 binley and kemna 2005 cassiani et al 2014 everett and meju 2005 revil et al 2006 however these sophisticated academic methods and techniques are often not feasible given real world limits on time cost and data availability especially for risk and uncertainty analyses therefore academics and practitioners should collaborate to develop qualitative methods for drywell optimization and risk assessment bode et al 2018 if site specific data are not available for a given subsurface literature values of similar systems can in principle be used for an initial assessment schilling et al 2017 the fort irwin drywell case study demonstrated that urban and rural areas in the arid or semi arid environment may still receive regular input of water from urban runoff and can be used as an alternative source of infiltration water such a scenario will lead to a constant head boundary condition within the drywell and will act as an upper bound for groundwater recharge and as a worst case scenario for the contaminant transport therefore this study only considered constant head boundary conditions to understand the effect of stochastic parameters on cumulative infiltration and recharge volumes the area of recharge arrival time and arrival location of infiltrated water from a drywell additional research is needed to study the influence of natural weather conditions such as rain frequency and intensity at a drywell site episodic rainfall events create transient boundary conditions in the drywell that will add more complexity to recharge estimates and risk assessment

5687,drywells are widely used as managed aquifer recharge devices to capture stormwater runoff and recharge groundwater but little research has examined the role of subsurface heterogeneity in hydraulic properties on drywell recharge efficiency numerical experiments were therefore conducted on a 2d axisymmetric domain using the hydrus 2d 3d software to systematically study the influence of various homogenous soil types and subsurface heterogeneity on recharge from drywells under constant head conditions the mean cumulative infiltration μi and recharge μr volumes increased with an increase in the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s for various homogeneous soils subsurface heterogeneity was described by generating ten stochastic realizations of soil hydraulic properties with selected standard deviation σ and horizontal x and vertical z correlation lengths after 365 days values of μi μr and the radius of the recharge area increased with σ and x but decreased with z the value of μr was always smaller for a homogeneous than a heterogeneous domain this indicates that recharge for a heterogeneous profile cannot be estimated with an equivalent homogeneous profile the value of μr was always smaller than μi and correlations were highly non linear due to vadose zone storage knowledge of only infiltration volume can therefore lead to misinterpretation of recharge efficiency especially at earlier times the arrival time of the wetting front at the bottom boundary 60 m ranged from 21 to 317 days with earlier times occurring for increasing σ and z the corresponding first arrival location can be 0 1 44 m away from the bottom releasing point of a drywell in the horizontal direction with greater distances occurring for increasing σ and x this knowledge is important to accurately assess drywell recharged performance water quantity and water quality keywords drywell infiltration recharge arrival time arrival location hydrus 2d 3d 1

of groundwater resources has resulted in groundwater depletion increased pollution land subsidence soil salinization and seawater intrusion in parts of the world feng et al 2013 urban development with impermeable and paved surfaces leads to reduced infiltration of runoff water and extreme flooding events but also offers opportunities to capture and store excess runoff and recharge groundwater increased flooding from climate extremes also provides opportunities for collecting storing and injecting stormwater into an aquifer for use during droughts scanlon et al 2016 sustainable utilization of water resources can be achieved by reducing the demand for groundwater through increased water use efficiency conjunctive use of alternative water sources or increasing recharge dillon 2005 stormwater capture infiltration and recharge technologies such as infiltration basins vadose zone infiltration devices like drywells edwards et al 2016 sasidharan et al 2018a sasidharan et al 2019 infiltration trenches stormwater wells and direct injection wells dillon 2005 gale 2005 richard and peter 2017 have been developed over the last 60 years the main focuses of all these managed aquifer recharge strategies are to prevent flooding and surface and groundwater pollution enhance drought resilience with short term coping strategies and long term adaptive capacity and increase groundwater recharge dillon et al 2019 scanlon et al 2016 washington state department of ecology 2006 a few major cities in california and washington achieve nearly 70 100 percent of their groundwater recharge through stormwater drainage wells or drywell infiltration cadmus 1999 epa 1999 similarly rapidly developing urban areas in arizona florida and texas are planning to continue to build stormwater wells as a cost effective way to manage runoff and to recharge groundwater cadmus 1999 epa 1999 accurate estimation of groundwater recharge remains a challenge in the field of hydrology due to its nonlinear nature which varies with space and time wang et al 2016 traditionally both physical water balance darcy flux root zone drainage and chemical tracers approaches have been used to estimate recharge in arid and semi arid areas allison et al 1994 however these techniques are expensive not useful for short term measurement and exhibit large errors hendrickx and walker 2017 huang et al 2017 in addition spatial variability in local topography soil texture and structure produce heterogeneity in groundwater recharge that requires a large number of sampling locations allison et al 1994 limited field measurements are increasingly used in combination with vadose zone numerical modeling as a time and cost effective method to estimate groundwater recharge min et al 2015 ries et al 2015 small 2005 turkeltaub et al 2015 wang et al 2016 however most of these studies only considered root zone soil moisture deep vadose zone soil water content and matric pressure data to determine the average soil hydraulic parameters for the vadose zone to a maximum depth of 1 20 m furthermore these investigations have shown large differences in groundwater recharge and simulated data due to uncertainty in model parameters soil heterogeneity such as the presence of high and low permeable soil layers their horizontal and vertical distribution and connectivity significantly impacts water flow in the subsurface mantoglou and gelhar 1987 schilling et al 2017 xie et al 2014 yeh et al 1985a b inadequate characterization of subsurface heterogeneity can lead to uncertainty in the prediction of water flow through the vadose zone contaminant migration and estimation of recharge deterministic and stochastic models can be used to study water flow in the vadose zone and groundwater recharge from a drywell the miller and miller 1956 similitude scaling approach is a stochastic model that has been widely used to analyze flow and transport processes in heterogeneous unsaturated soil systems hammel and roth 1998 roth 1995 roth and hammel 1996 tseng and jury 1994 vereecken et al 2007 our previous study investigated the influence of stochastic vadose zone heterogeneity on drywell infiltration behavior and determined the effective unsaturated soil hydraulic properties sasidharan et al 2019 most previous infiltration and recharge studies have looked at the long term steady state conditions when infiltration below the root zone equals recharge gray and norum 1967 mantoglou and gelhar 1987 yeh et al 1985a b however the installation of a new drywell that receives episodic water input will create transient conditions in the vadose zone that will change infiltration recharge and storage in this case infiltration will be greater than recharge until a new steady state condition is achieved transient recharge behavior is important for drywells because during their typical operational lifespan e g a decade they may not ever achieve steady state conditions however no literature has investigated the effect of subsurface heterogeneity on groundwater recharge from a drywell under constant head conditions which is an upper bound best case scenario for recharge and worst case scenario for contaminant transport one of the major selling points for drywells compared to direct injection wells is the opportunity for vadose zone treatment of contaminants edwards et al 2016 current regulatory standards for drywells only require 1 5 13 m separation distance between the bottom of the drywell and the local groundwater table city of portland 2008 2015 epa 1999 washington state department of ecology 2006 however many previous studies using microbial contaminants like viruses sasidharan et al 2018b sasidharan et al 2017a schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 and bacteria camesano and logan 1998 johnson et al 1995 sasidharan et al 2017b demonstrated that microbial retention and inactivation is a function of the flow velocity and residence time soil profiles with high permeability or preferential flow paths arnaud et al 2015 bradford et al 2017 can lead to the early arrival of pathogenic microbes at the water table in addition monitoring wells to characterize recharge water quality are usually installed within a few meters of a drywell hamad et al 2016 izuka 2011 this implicitly assumes that the arrival of recharge water occurs directly below the bottom of the drywell in many cases drinking water supply wells have been contaminated or threatened by water infiltrated from drywells i e stormwater drainage wells haney et al 1989 varying degrees contamination of groundwater by stormwater drainage wells has been reported across the us cadmus 1991 1996 1999 haney et al 1989 michael 1997 orr 1993 usepa 1997 wilde 1994 therefore an understanding of the influence of subsurface heterogeneity on the arrival time and location of recharge during the short term operation of a drywell is essential when assessing water quality the objective of this study is to investigate the influence of subsurface heterogeneity on groundwater recharge from a drywell especially the short term condition when recharge does not yet equal infiltration the hydrus 2d 3d software was used to directly simulate cumulative infiltration and recharge volumes from a drywell for different homogenous and heterogeneous soils constant head conditions were considered in the drywell to facilitate the determination of subsurface soil properties on the upper limit for recharge and contaminant transport and the lower limit on arrival time subsurface heterogeneity was described in this model by generating stochastic realizations of soil hydraulic properties with selected standard deviation and vertical and horizontal correlation lengths the influence of stochastic subsurface heterogeneity parameters on cumulative infiltration i and recharge r volumes the radius of recharge rx early eat and late lat arrival times and early eap and late lap arrival points were determined to understand the drywell infiltration and recharge behavior in the deep vadose zone 60 m 2 materials and methods 2 1 mathematical model this research explores the role of subsurface heterogeneities on recharge from a drywell using numerical experiments input parameters initial conditions and boundary conditions that were employed in these numerical experiments were generally based on results from drywells located in fort irwin ca that are discussed in the supporting information si the hydrus 2d 3d software package version 3 šejna et al 2018 šimůnek et al 2018 2016 was used to simulate infiltration from the drywell redistribution in the vadose zone and recharge into the groundwater hydrus 2d 3d numerically solves the 2 dimensional axisymmetric form of richards equation using the van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 unsaturated soil hydraulic functions unless otherwise stated default values of hydraulic parameters e g the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks the shape parameter in the soil water retention function α the residual soil water content θr the saturated soil water content θs the pore size distribution parameter in the soil water retention function n and the tortuosity parameter in the hydraulic conductivity function l for various soil textural classes were taken from the hydrus 2d 3d soil catalog carsel and parrish 1988 šejna et al 2014 fig 1 shows a schematic of an example simulation flow domain drywell geometry initial condition boundary conditions and scale of the domain the drywell geometry employed in this study was adapted from a maxwell iv model torrents resources phoenix arizona usa drywell dw2 installed at the fort irwin study site see section 1 in si the complex geometry of the drywell and the dynamics of the water flow from the drywell is described in detail by sasidharan et al 2018a the drywell has a size of 36 m height h 1 8 m width w a 60 m h 50 m w simulation flow domain was chosen to best capture the infiltration radius of the drywell to account for the drywell depth and to accurately estimate the arrival time of the recharge water and rate fig 1 the simulation domain was discretized using a two dimensional triangular finite element mesh with the meshgen tool available within hydrus 2d 3d šejna et al 2014 the mesh was refined at the left part of the domain where infiltration from the drywell was simulated to reduce the mass balance error the finite element mesh was adjusted such that the size of elements was smaller 0 05 0 1 m near the drywell and the grid size was gradually increased with radial distance from the drywell with a maximum element size of 0 5 0 75 m the quality of the finite element mesh was assessed by checking the mass balance error reported by hydrus 2d 3d at the end of the simulation mass balance errors were always below 1 and these values are generally considered acceptable brunetti et al 2017 a no flux boundary condition was assigned to the upper boundary the nodes representing the right and lower left the boundary between the drywell and the bottom boundary sides of the flow domain were set to no flux boundaries the nodes at the bottom boundary z 60 m were assigned a free drainage boundary condition i e the water table was assumed to be far below this point note that the numerical experiments in this study do not account for the effect of the water table and future site specific analysis and modeling studies are therefore warranted justification for the constant head condition is given in section 1 of the si to represent a continuously full drywell the total head h h z at the left boundary at z 8 to 38 was constant and equal to 0 m i e the pressure head decreased linearly with depth from 38 m at the bottom boundary of the drywell to 8 at the top fig 1 the initial condition ic in the flow domain was specified in terms of the soil water pressure head h x z and was set to a constant pressure head of 0 5 m fig 1 this initial condition is justified because the bottom of the drywell at fort irwin is approximately 25 m from the water table in addition the water retention curve for the fort irwin soil fig s4 shows that at 50 cm pressure head the corresponding water content 0 06 is close to the residual water content 0 043 table 1 of the fort irwin soil therefore we choose this relatively low ics to make the change in storage smaller and to estimate recharge accurately within the simulation time 3 numerical experiments 3 1 homogeneous domain numerical experiments experiment i table 1 were conducted to determine the values of i r and rx under the sand s loamy sand ls sandy loam sl loam l and silt si soil materials for 365 days 1 year a homogeneous flow domain was considered in these simulations and the hydraulic parameters for various soil textures were taken from the hydrus 2d 3d soil catalog table 1 the value of i was collected over time during the simulation as the total volume of water infiltrated from the full drywell i e the constant total head boundary similarly the value of r was calculated as the volume of water drained through the bottom free drainage boundary the radius of recharge was calculated from the saturated nodes and its corresponding distance in the x direction at the bottom boundary of the flow domain note that all this information was available in output files of the hydrus 2d 3d software 3 2 heterogeneous domain the previous experiment considered idealized homogeneous soil systems however most field scale soil profiles are highly heterogeneous as shown in the fort irwin case study section 1 in si and the hydraulic parameters may change over short distances natural geologic processes tend to produce layers and lenses in soil texture that form parallel to the soil surface

plant roots burrowing earthworms and animals spatial variations in soil structure and cracks in clayey soils and fractured rocks flury et al 1994 hencher et al 2011 hendrickx and flury 2001 phillips and lorz 2008 sidle et al 2000 smith et al 2008 uchida et al 2003 usda 2016 this study did not explicitly investigate the effect of preferential flow pathways and macropores which has been extensively explored in previous research kung 1990 larsbo et al 2005 nativ et al 1995 šimůnek and bradford 2008 wood et al 1997 several approaches such as univariate multivariate and multiple point geostatistical techniques can be used to represent geometrical features and quantify soil variability elkateb et al 2003 jackson and caldwell 1993 meerschman et al 2013 in this study high permeable horizontal and vertical soil layers lenses are represented using the miller miller similitude geostatistical approach which has been widely used in previous research feyen et al 1998 roth 1995 roth and hammel 1996 sasidharan et al 2019 vereecken et al 2007 the original miller miller concept of scaling is based on using the scaling factor to adjust the degree of magnification or reduction of the ks and h relative to a standard reference value šimůnek et al 2012 the hydrus 2d 3d computer software has an option to generate stochastic distributions of hydraulic conductivity α k and pressure head α h scaling factors using the miller miller similitude approximation miller and miller 1956 which links these two scaling factors as follows α k α h 2 in this study lognormal distribution for the scaling factors were employed šimůnek et al 2007 three input parameters the standard deviation σ of log10 α k and its correlation length in the lateral the x correlation length x and vertical the z correlation length z directions were used to generate the stochastic field the value of σ determines the extent of variations in the scaling factors with higher values leading to higher variations in scaling factors the correlation length is a measure of how similar the scaling factors are in a specific direction and to what distance a high value of the x correlation length means that the scaling factor maintains similar values for a greater horizontal distance the same applies to the z correlation length in the vertical direction rassam et al 2003 procedures for generating autocorrelated or uncorrelated scaling factor fields and the original algorithm used in hydrus have been described in detail in the literature el kadi 1986 freeze 1975 mejía and rodríguez iturbe 1974 soil hydraulic parameters ks α θr θs and n for stochastic simulations were obtained from experiments conducted at the fort irwin site experiment ii table 1 in particular inverse optimization of falling head experimental data was used to obtain ks and α sasidharan et al 2018a whereas other parameters θr θs and n were obtained from the measured particle size distribution silt clay fraction and the rosetta software schaap et al 2001 segal et al 2009 constant head drywell simulations in heterogeneous domains were used to determine i and r after 365 days multiple realizations of the stochastic parameters were employed to determine mean values of i μi and r μr and associated standard deviations the computational time and cost to conduct these recharge simulations were large to minimize these factors only ten realizations were considered for each stochastic heterogeneity parameter combination the justification for using 10 realizations is given in our previous research sasidharan et al 2019 in particular these authors found that the mean and standard deviation of cumulative infiltration volume in heterogeneous soil profiles stabilized after around ten realizations for stochastic parameters

2019 in addition a simulation for a homogenous domain with the fort irwin soil hydraulic parameters was conducted to compare the μi and μr between homogeneous and heterogeneous domains the times when the first i e early arrival time eat and last i e late arrival time lat bottom boundary nodes got saturated for the first and last times were extracted from the output data file with nodal water contents from each hydrus 2d 3d simulation similarly the first i e the early arrival point eap and last i e the late arrival point lap bottom boundary nodes that were saturated were also calculated a mean radius of recharge rx was calculated as the distance in the x direction between the first and last nodes at the bottom boundary that were fully saturated at the end of the 365 days simulation mean parameter values and 95 confidence intervals ci were calculated for all parameters from ten simulations 4 result and discussions 4 1 homogeneous soil profiles numerical experiments were conducted to better understand the transient relationship between the cumulative infiltration and recharge volumes in homogeneous soil domains simulations considered higher permeability soils e g s ls sl l and si that are generally used for vadose zone infiltration devices fig 2 a and b show simulated water content θ profiles in various soils e g s ls sl l and si after 0 73 and 365 days respectively fig 3 presents corresponding information about the infiltration and recharge behavior in these same simulations the width and depth of the cone of infiltration after 0 73 days fig 2a decreases with a decrease in the soil ks in the order s ls sl l and si table 1 similarly the value of i as a function of time increases with the soil ks fig 3a the recharge at a specific time depends on changes in the soil hydraulic properties with θ van genuchten et al 1991 and the radius of the cone of infiltration at the bottom boundary rx yeh et al 1985a and yeh et al 1985b demonstrated that the variability of capillary pressure or moisture content increases when the mean capillary pressure increases and the anisotropy ratio vertical horizontal of the effective unsaturated ks increases when the mean capillary pressure increases or mean moisture content decreases coarser soils e g sand with larger pore sizes have lower θ and k θ hydraulic conductivity at varying water saturation values before the wetting front arrives fig s5a consequently the background θ fig 2 and the initial recharge rate fig 3b is lower in coarser than finer textured soils however coarser soils also have higher values of k θ when θ approaches saturated conditions fig s5b the wetting front therefore arrives at the bottom boundary faster in coarser than finer textured soils in 0 8 days for sand compared to 16 7 days for silt and this is associated with a dramatic increase in r fig 3b and rx fig 3c at the end of the simulation 365 days the cones of infiltration fig 2b are similar and rx 21 5 m fig 3c for various soil types and the final value of r increases with the soil ks fig 3b fig 3d shows plots of i versus r at 365 day for the simulations in various soils note that a large volume of water needs to infiltrate into the soil before recharge from the drywell rapidly increases furthermore this delay in recharge increases for coarser textured soils that have lower background values of θ for example recharge rapidly increased when i 9526 m3 for sand compared to i 1896 m3 for silt this occurs because infiltrating water needs to fill more of the pore space in coarser lower initial θ than in finer textured soils before the cone of infiltration can reach the bottom boundary these simulation results will be sensitive to the model s initial conditions in this work we have assumed an initial head of 0 5 m throughout the domain note that the simulated i 1896 9526 m3 can have a resemblance to an actual arid or semi arid site like fort irwin which received 515 m3 input water from irrigation runoff during 200 days monitoring period summer 4 2 heterogeneous soil profiles 4 2 1 cumulative infiltration and recharge the above simulations were highly idealized because they considered homogeneous soil profiles in contrast natural subsurface is inherently heterogeneous however previous studies hencher et al 2011 phillips and lorz 2008 sasidharan et al 2019 sidle et al 2000 smith et al 2008 uchida et al 2003 usda 2016 and the case study presented in the si demonstrates that layered soil structures are very common illustrative simulations were therefore conducted to better understand the effects of stochastic heterogeneity parameters x z and σ for ks on the cumulative infiltration and recharge volumes from a drywell figs 4 and 5 show representative h and θ distributions respectively after 365 days constant head simulation in homogeneous figs 2a and 3a and stochastic figs 2b h and 3b h domains the fort irwin soil hydraulic parameters experiment ii table 1 were employed in these simulations and stochastic parameters equaled x 10 m z 0 1 m and σ 1 in fig 4b and 5b x 1 m z 0 1 m and σ 1 in figs 4c and 5c x 0 1 m z 0 1 m and σ 1 in figs 4d and 5d x 1 m z 1 m and σ 1 in figs 4e and 5e x 1 m z 2 m and σ 1 in figs 4f and 5f x 1 m z 0 1 m and σ 0 5 in figs 4g and 5g and x 1 m z 0 1 m and σ 0 25 in figs 4h and 5h heterogeneous domains display wider distributions in the lateral direction of the saturated area and the presence of unsaturated pockets within the cone of infiltration compared to a homogeneous domain figs 4a and 5a fig 6 shows values of μi and μr and their 95 ci after 365 days as a function of σ fig 6a x fig 6b and z fig 6c specific stochastic parameters that were employed in these simulations included σ 0 25 0 5 and 1 when x 1 m and z 0 1 m in fig 6a x 0 1 1 10 m when z 0 1 m and σ 1 in fig 6b and z 0 1 1 2 m when x 1 m and σ 1 in fig 6c fig 6 also includes values of i and r after 365 days for the corresponding homogeneous domain a comparison of results for homogeneous and heterogeneous simulations reveals that both infiltration and recharge were higher for heterogeneous domains consequently simulations that employ a homogenous domain will always underestimate the actual infiltration and recharge efficiency of a drywell the heterogeneous simulations indicate that the value of μr will always be smaller than μi during the short term experiment this revealed that over the 365 days simulation period not all infiltrated water will recharge groundwater because some of the water will be trapped in isolated pockets or high permeable regions surrounded by low permeable layers figs 4 and 5 the distribution and volume of trapped water in the flow domain will be highly dependent on the subsurface heterogeneity fig 6 shows that μi and μr tended to increase with σ fig 6a and x fig 6b but decreased with z fig 6c due to differences in the water distribution figs 4 and 5 fig 7 shows a similar dependence of the mean value of rx at the bottom boundary on σ fig 7a x fig 7b and z fig 7c an increase in σ leads to the formation of more permeable regions which enhance infiltration fig 6a recharge fig 6a and spreading fig 7a similarly an increase in x produces larger lateral lenses with high permeability that enhance the rapid movement of the wetting front in the horizontal direction fig 5d c and b and facilitate the infiltration and recharge of water over a larger area figs 6b and 7b conversely an increase in z creates larger vertical lenses with high permeability which facilitates the rapid vertical movement of water over a relatively small area fig 5e f 6c and 7c the 95 cis for μi and μr were sometimes very large in fig 6 especially for the highest values of x and z in fig 6b and c respectively this uncertainty reflects differences in the continuity of the high permeability regions and the area of recharge fig 7 several other studies have reported extensive lateral horizontal moisture movement but a limited vertical movement in different systems mantoglou and gelhar 1987 routson et al 1979 sinai et al 1974 yeh et al 1985a b however these general findings only give information regarding the long term trend of infiltration and recharge and do not consider the presence of high permeable horizontally and vertically correlated soil layers therefore it is important to understand the infiltration and recharge behavior the arrival time and arrival location during short term drywell operation to establish a site specific monitoring system 4 2 2 time and location of recharge the drywell regulatory guidelines require a mandatory separation distance of only 1 5 13 m between the drywell and the local groundwater table to provide a contaminant treatment zone city of portland 2008 city of portland 2015 epa 1999 washington state department of ecology 2006 however soils with highly permeable vertical lenses or fractures could minimize the contaminant treatment time and can produce an early arrival of contaminants such as pathogenic microbes to groundwater bradford et al 2017 mohanty et al 2016 wang et al 2014a b figs 4 7 examined infiltration and recharge from a drywell in heterogeneous and homogeneous soils after 365 days under constant head conditions values of the mean final recharge rate μr and mean rx in fig 7 can be used to estimate the average yearly recharge flux to groundwater from a drywell i e μr divided by πrx 2 for a constant head condition fig s6 this information is vital for determining the average yearly darcy velocity during recharge for conservatively transported contaminants during recharge however it does not address variability in the recharge behavior with time or the location on the bottom boundary simulation results were therefore further evaluated to address these issues this information has important implications for properly determining times and locations for assessing the potential migration of contaminants through the vadose zone to the groundwater table fig 8 provides summary information about recharge with time and location for stochastic simulations when x 1 m z 0 1 m and σ 0 25 0 5 and 1 the early eat and late lat mean arrival times decreased with σ in fig 8a and b respectively however the mean location for early eap and late lap arrival point increased with σ fig 8c and d observed differences in the early and late arrival times and points can be explained by analyzing the μr data with time fig 8e and f there was a significant delay in recharge when σ 0 25 compared to higher σs fig 8e and the value of μr was very close to that for the homogeneous soil at 365 days fig 8 a small value of σ leads to a more uniform and lower permeability and a cone of infiltration that takes longer to fill before the wetting front arrives at the bottom boundary an increase in σ creates more high permeability zones that decrease the early and late arrival times it also increases the spreading of water figs 4h g d and 7a and thereby increases the distance to the early and late arrival points interestingly all 4 parameters eat lat eap lap showed a large 95 cis due to differences in the predicted water distributions fig 9 provides summary information about recharge with time and location for stochastic simulations when z 0 1 m σ 1 and x 0 1 1 10 m fig 9a d show values of eat lat eap and lap respectively and their corresponding 95 cis that increase with the x correlation length these trends reflect increasing water spreading with x due to larger lenses in the lateral direction with high permeability fig 9e and f show values of μr as a function of time during early i e 75 days and late i e 365 days stages respectively early stages of recharge show a decrease in μr with an increase in x because recharge is delayed by increasing lateral spreading this trend is consistent with the results displayed in fig 9a d conversely μr was greatest when x 10 m at later stages of recharge fig 9f this suggests that vertical migration and recharge was enhanced once larger horizontal lenses with higher permeability were filled in this case higher values of θ and k θ were achieved in high permeability lenses that enhanced recharge previous researchers have similarly reported that the vertical effective ks is small and the lateral effective ks is large in the wetting front of stratified soil mantoglou and gelhar 1987 which increased the lateral movement of contaminants in the unsaturated zone below various waste disposal facilities crosby iii et al 1968 crosby iii et al 1971 palmquist and johnson 1962 price et al 1979 prill 1977 enhanced lateral movement can be attributed to the fact that at high tension the hydraulic conductivity of fine textured materials is relatively high and water may prefer to spread laterally in a fine bed than to move vertically through coarser ones routson et al 1979 in natural environments layered soil profiles with high permeable sand layers followed by low permeable clay lenses with extensions and thicknesses of several tens to hundreds of meters can be present phillips and lorz 2008 trautwein et al 1983 investigated wastewater movement from an evaporation pond in the stratified unsaturated zone and observed that the contamination pool extended laterally to a distance of 2000 m due to the formation of a saturated perched water zone above the water table the presence of such geological formations e g clay layer at fort irwin si could delay groundwater recharge from a drywell from 1 to 100 years therefore the presence of a high permeable soil around the drywell infiltration area may not contribute to groundwater recharge for many years fig 10 provides summary information about recharge with time and location for stochastic simulations when x 1 m σ 1 and z 0 1 1 and 2 m fig 10a and b show that the values of eat and lat respectively decreased with z conversely values of eap and lap increased fig 10c and decreased fig 10d with z fig 10e shows that values of μr during the early stage 75 days increased with z among all stochastic parameter combinations the x 1 z 2 σ 1 simulation had the earliest arrival time 34 12 days the presence of highly permeable vertical lenses facilitates the faster downward movement of water and thus an early arrival time fig 10a however the value of μr during the late stage 365 days was greatest when z 0 1 m and lowest when z 2 m fig 10f in this case the presence of a thick vertical lens fig 10f when z 2 m reduced the overall width of the cone of infiltration figs 4 and 5 and the recharge area fig 7 and this decreased the long term value of μr all 4 parameters showed a large 95 cis for simulations shown in fig 10 and this reflects the variability in water distributions and flow rates groundwater monitoring wells are commonly installed a few meters away from a drywell hamad et al 2016 izuka 2011 previous stochastic theory studies mantoglou and gelhar 1987 yeh et al 1985a b predicts that a contamination plume tends to spread laterally in dry vadose zone soils while vertical movement is slow contaminants may therefore arrive at the water table much later than is predicted by many classic one dimensional models however this study demonstrated that the arrival time could range from 33 to 317 days and the arrival location could be 0 1 44 m away from the bottom releasing point of a drywell depending on the heterogeneity if the location of a monitoring well and the sampling timing are not properly selected then the recharge water quality can lead to a misinterpretation of the anticipated transport and risks from contaminants consequently the use of model projections for estimating the magnitude of groundwater recharge and transport of contaminants from drywells in heterogeneous subsurface conditions will likely have a high degree of uncertainty one should therefore be cautious when determining the risks from drywells during the short term operation at a site that is not thoroughly characterized based on the modeling realizations the value of μr was always smaller for a homogeneous than a heterogeneous domain figs 8f 9f and 10f previously sasidharan et al 2018a found that an equivalent homogeneous soil domain could be used to accurately predict μi for a heterogeneous soil domain the sensitivity of a modeled recharge volume to various physical configurations and connectivity of soil hydraulic properties implies that measurement of the soil heterogeneity below the drywell is an important consideration when evaluating the potential for groundwater recharge as shown in fig s7 the correlation between drywell infiltration and the recharge volume can be highly non linear for heterogeneous soil domains thus model estimates of short or long term recharge efficiencies may not be reliable when constrained solely by the inferred volume of infiltration based on empirical measurements within a drywell system 5 conclusions and future implications drywells are widely used to capture stormwater and convey it to the vadose zone for subsequent groundwater recharge however assessing the performance of a drywell and its recharge efficiency over the short or long term is very tedious time consuming expensive and complex to successfully install a drywell conduct groundwater monitoring and collect accurate groundwater quality information requires a careful design of field experiments and a knowledge of the subsurface heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties numerical experiments were conducted to understand the relationship between the cumulative infiltration and recharge volumes in the homogeneous s ls sl l and si soil domains the cumulative infiltration and recharge volumes increased with ks during the initial stages of infiltration the coarser textured sandy soil had a lower background θ and therefore a large volume of water had to infiltrate before the recharge rate from the drywell rapidly increased the wetting front arrived at the bottom boundary faster in coarser than finer textured soils however all soil types had a similar value of the recharge area radius at the end of the simulation note that this may not occur when the model is run with a more representative transient loading condition groundwater monitoring well installations placed at the outer radius of the recharge area may therefore not be the best choice homogeneous soil profiles are highly idealized conditions compared to natural subsurface soils that are highly heterogeneous therefore additional numerical experiments were conducted to better understand the influence of stochastic heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties on drywell infiltration and recharge behavior the cumulative infiltration and recharge volume after a 365 days constant head simulation were higher for heterogeneous domains than for the homogeneous domain however the cumulative recharge volume was smaller than the cumulative infiltration volume and their correlations were highly non linear this result indicates that a fraction of infiltrated water can be trapped in isolated pockets or highly permeable regions in the vadose zone and the knowledge of the infiltration volume under varying stormwater flow events may not be a reliable predictor of potential short term recharge both cumulative infiltration and recharge increased with increasing σ and the lateral correlation length but decreased with an increasing vertical correlation length the radius of recharge at the bottom boundary showed a similar dependency on stochastic parameters the mean early and late arrival times decreased with σ whereas the mean early and late arrival points increased with σ an increase in σ creates more high permeability and connectivity zones and increases the spreading of water the values of both early and late arrival times and locations increased with the x correlation length the presence of larger highly permeable lateral lenses increases the spreading of water at the same time values of early and late arrival times decreased with the z correlation length in contrast early and late arrival locations increased and decreased with z respectively the presence of highly permeable vertical lenses facilitates the faster downward moment of water but reduces the overall width of the cone of filtration and the recharge area this research points out that the assumption of a highly permeable homogenous soil around the drywell may result in unrealistic model estimates of recharge to groundwater some understanding of the hydraulic properties subsurface heterogeneity and its continuity between the drywell and the groundwater table is essential for making an informed decision on recharge and contaminant transport the current drywell infiltration tests performed by contractors are very simple and fail to capture accurately the hydraulic behavior of a site therefore carefully planned falling head and constant head multiple cycles experiment should be conducted in a newly installed drywell and effective hydraulic properties can be obtained by the inverse optimization of the observed data sasidharan et al 2018a 2019 in the absence of extensive knowledge about the subsurface heterogeneity an equivalent homogeneous domain with inversely optimized stochastic parameters can be used to estimate the cumulative infiltration sasidharan et al 2019 even if such an analysis may not provide an accurate estimation of recharge under transient conditions this research demonstrated the importance of subsurface heterogeneity on recharge from drywells however it is important to recognize the limitations and assumptions employed in this study the consideration of heterogeneous subsurface and subsequent data analysis can be time consuming and adds a lot more complexity for example a maximum x correlation length of 10 m was considered in this study due to the limitation in the size of the model simulation domain size and the associated simulation time and cost the stochastic input parameters used in the numerical experiments were hypothetical since site specific data is not available and initial and boundary conditions were chosen based on the limited knowledge available from fort irwin s study site it is recommended that hydrogeologists drywell practitioners and regulators implement new strategies during drywell installation to collect detailed site specific subsurface heterogeneity data for future validation studies for example drywell performance could be assessed using single or multiple slanted boreholes that are instrumented with water content probes and solution sampling ports at several depths to track water content profiles and contaminant migration respectively dahan et al 2009 such information can help to quantify the influence of subsurface heterogeneity on recharge and serve as an early warning system of contaminant migration in the vadose zone dahan et al 2009 in addition a variety of near surface geophysical techniques can provide valuable information on site structure hydrology and hydrogeology and contamination plume information annan 2005 binley and kemna 2005 cassiani et al 2014 everett and meju 2005 revil et al 2006 however these sophisticated academic methods and techniques are often not feasible given real world limits on time cost and data availability especially for risk and uncertainty analyses therefore academics and practitioners should collaborate to develop qualitative methods for drywell optimization and risk assessment bode et al 2018 if site specific data are not available for a given subsurface literature values of similar systems can in principle be used for an initial assessment schilling et al 2017 the fort irwin drywell case study demonstrated that urban and rural areas in the arid or semi arid environment may still receive regular input of water from urban runoff and can be used as an alternative source of infiltration water such a scenario will lead to a constant head boundary condition within the drywell and will act as an upper bound for groundwater recharge and as a worst case scenario for the contaminant transport therefore this study only considered constant head boundary conditions to understand the effect of stochastic parameters on cumulative infiltration and recharge volumes the area of recharge arrival time and arrival location of infiltrated water from a drywell additional research is needed to study the influence of natural weather conditions such as rain frequency and intensity at a drywell site episodic rainfall events create transient boundary conditions in the drywell that will add more complexity to recharge estimates and risk assessment

5688,climate change is expected to reduce recharge to montane aquifers in the western united states but it is unclear how this will impact groundwater resources in watersheds where intensive surface water development has disrupted the natural hydrologic regime to better understand sources of recharge and associated vulnerabilities of groundwater supply in this setting we made a detailed geochemical survey of domestic wells finished in fractured bedrock throughout the yuba and bear river watersheds sierra nevada foothills northern california during historic drought 2015 2016 stable isotopes of water and noble gas recharge temperatures closely tracked atmospheric lapse rates across a broad elevation gradient 100 2000 m indicating groundwater inputs are dominated by local precipitation that rapidly recharges fractured bedrock during the winter wet season however nearly one quarter of wells had water isotopes that were fractionated by evaporation and warm recharge

recharge subsidies from diverted surface water had elevated levels of nitrate and coliform bacteria compared to those replenished exclusively by local precipitation which are more vulnerable to supply

surface water throughout the lower reaches of the yuba and bear watersheds for both domestic supply and irrigation fig 1c the bear river in particular is intensively managed as water conveyance infrastructure and receives approximately 200 000 acre feet of imported water annually from the yuba and american rivers which have higher elevation catchments fig 1c the largest purveyor of surface waters in the study area is the nevada irrigation district nid which operates 10 reservoirs in the yuba and bear watersheds that service over 100 000 km2 in placer nevada and yuba counties through approximately 680 km of mostly open and unlined canals kleinschmidt associates 2011 monthly deliveries of both treated water for domestic use fig 2b and untreated irrigation water through the nid distribution system have a distinct seasonality that is an inversion of the natural flow regime and roughly correspond to canal flowrates which peak during the dry season hydrofocus 2012 nid personal communication 2019 3 methods 3 1 groundwater site selection and attribution a randomized stratified survey design was used to select a statistically representative subset of wells to characterize the groundwater resource used for domestic supply in the study area e g belitz et al 2010 the groundwater resource was defined as the combined area of all 1 km2 public land survey system sections within the study area boundary containing at least one domestic supply well within dwr usgs state or county databases jasper et al 2017 this extent was then subdivided into 75 equal area grid cells approximately 30 km2 each to ensure that the survey design was spatially unbiased one site within each grid cell that was suitable for sampling and for which permission could be obtained was randomly selected from all known domestic supply sources a total of 71 drilled wells and 4 developed springs used for domestic drinking water were selected for sampling and are all referred to as wells in this paper unless otherwise noted fig 1b sample site density was higher in the more populated portion of the study area at elevations below 1000 m and along major transportation corridors route 49 and i 80 at higher elevations site and well construction information e g depth to open interval depth of well as well as usgs reported groundwater levels are detailed in table 1 the usgs data release associated with this study jasper et al 2017 and all groundwater well identifiers here correspond to the last three characters of the gama id field in the data release well completion reports for all study wells confirm they were finished in fractured rock except for b25 and y29 which were finished in unconsolidated volcaniclastic deposits we used historic 1981 2010 climate normals from the bcm to calculate map and maat at each study site flint flint 2014 we also re sampled climate data at 1 km2 resolution 4430 point locations to see how climate broadly varied with elevation throughout the study area we weighted normal monthly mean temperatures by normal monthly precipitation to calculate precipitation weighted maat at each location since there is very little precipitation in the study area during the summer fig 2 precipitation weighted maat values are broadly representative of winter air temperatures under which the bulk of groundwater recharge occurs beneath the snow line supplementary material sm1 3 2 groundwater sampling and analysis groundwater wells were sampled from november 2015 through may 2016 during the latter portion of the historic 2012 2016 california drought precipitation was approximately 60 80 of the 1981 2010 normal during the water years preceding sampling 2012 2015 prism climate group http www prism oregonstate edu from may 2013 through november 2015 the palmer drought severity index pdsi in the study region noaa national climatic data center california climate region 2 https www ncdc noaa gov ranged from 2 5 to 4 0 indicating moderate to severe drought conditions palmer 1965 during sampling above average rainfall in december 2015 and january march 2016 broke the drought slightly but dry conditions resumed from april 2016 through the end of the sampling campaign and persisted until heavy rains beginning in october 2016 ended the drought groundwater sampling methods followed the usgs national field manual u s geological survey variously dated as described by jasper et al 2017 all samples were collected as close to the wellhead as possible and represent raw untreated groundwater a field replicate sample was collected at eight of the study sites directly after the initial sample was taken the presence or absence of microbiological indicators total coliform escherichia coli and enterococci was determined in the field using u s environmental protection agency usepa method 1604 for the coliform bacteria species u s environmental protection agency 2002 and usepa method 1600 for enterococci u s environmental protection agency 2006 samples were analyzed for additional water quality parameters such as total dissolved solids tds nitrate as nitrogen no3 n and age dating tracers tritium and isotopes of carbon at various laboratories following methods and quality control protocols described by jasper et al 2017 samples were analyzed for stable isotopes of water δ18o δ2h at the usgs reston stable isotope laboratory rsil reporting units for stable isotopes of water are in delta δ notation where the ratio of stable isotopes of oxygen 18o 16o or hydrogen 2h 1h in the sample r is related to the ratio of those isotopes in the reference vienna standard mean ocean water rvsmow so that δ r rvsmow 1 1000 clark fritz 1997 analyses for δ18o and δ2h were made using dual inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometry following methods described in révész and coplen 2008 with respective analytical precisions of 0 2 and 2 however in practice reproducibility of measurements was much more precise with absolute differences among replicate sample pairs ranging from 0 00 to 0 07 mean of 0 03 for δ18o and 0 2 2 0 mean of 0 8 for δ2h in this study we summarize water isotope results in terms of d excess which is defined as δ2h 8δ18o dansgaard 1964 a d excess value lower than that of precipitation providing the trend for isotopes in precipitation has a slope of 8 in δ space is indicative of the effects of kinetic isotope fractionation due to evaporation samples were collected for dissolved noble gases ne ar kr xe in 10 ml copper tubes with care to avoid inclusion of air bubbles that were subsequently clamped to seal off from the atmosphere cey et al 2008 samples were analyzed at the lawrence livermore national laboratory llnl noble gas mass spectrometry facility following methods described by cey et al 2008 analytical precision was approximately 2 for ne and ar and 3 for kr and xe relative percent differences for measured noble gas concentrations between field replicate pairs were within 13 5 8 and 9 for ne ar kr and xe respectively except for one where the replicate showed evidence of sample degassing during collection or analysis and was not considered in calculation of groundwater recharge temperatures 3 3 surface water sampling and analysis to characterize the variability of surface water δ18o and δ2h in the study area over space and time we present here a dataset of 126 river water samples collected by the usgs between january 2000 and december 2002 at eight locations fig 1c four along the yuba river y1 y4 and four along the bear river b1 b4 at elevations ranging from 45 to 664 m the regional pdsi mostly oscillated between 1 0 and 3 0 during this time period indicating abnormally dry to severe drought conditions similar to those under which groundwater samples were collected a detailed timeseries of samples was taken monthly at the four bear river sites which are variously upstream and downstream from three major reservoirs rollins combie and camp far west fig 1c between december 2001 and december 2002 all samples were depth and width integrated with respect to the river channel and collected using sampling protocols described in the usgs national field manual u s geological survey variously dated depth and width integrated river temperatures were measured in situ additionally to characterize evaporative processes affecting the isotopic composition of standing surface water bodies in the yuba and bear watersheds stable isotope data is included here for 68 samples from a detailed sampling survey of the camp far west reservoir cfwr and the adjacent dairy farm mine pit lake in the lower portion of the bear river watershed elevation 80 m the samples were collected between from october 2001 through august 2003 at depths of 0 2 46 m below the water surface at various sites within and around the reservoir as detailed by alpers et al 2008 grab samples were taken from three high elevation 2360 3080 m mine pit lakes in the yuba river watershed from december 1999 to august 2000 all surface water samples were analyzed for δ18o and δ2h at the university of california davis as described by alpers et al 2008 while regional surface water data presented in this study were collected 15 years before the groundwater survey they are useful to broadly characterize the regional surface water endmember within the modern period of surface water regulation and were sampled under similar climate conditions 3 4 noble gas recharge temperature modeling we modeled noble gas recharge temperature ngrt using concentrations of dissolved ne kr ar and xe the concentrations of these noble gases in groundwater depend primarily on conditions determining equilibrium solubility at the water table during recharge temperature pressure and salinity and excess air i e air bubbles trapped below the water table that subsequently dissolve stute schlosser 2000 we used a numerical solution to determine best fit model parameters based on a weighted non linear least squares parameter estimation routine e g ballentine hall 1999 aeschbach hertig et al 1999 with either an unfractionated excess air ua model heaton vogel 1981 which requires a parameter for excess air or a closed system equilibration ce model aeschbach hertig et al 2000 which requires an additional fractionation parameter model fits were based on optimization of the chi squared test statistic χ 2 which quantifies misfits between observed and modeled gas concentrations aeschbach hertig et al 2000 model parameter error was quantified using the variance covariance matrix for ua model fits and monte carlo simulations for the ce based on the analytical error of dissolved gas concentrations as described by levy and faulkner 2019 we computed ngrt values for the 72 wells with acceptable noble gas data using both ua and ce models and estimated recharge salinity and pressure values based on sample tds and wellhead elevation respectively levy faulkner 2019 we selected gas models for each sample based on which had the higher χ 2 probability which was calculated using the χ 2 distribution test statistic and the degrees of freedom difference between number of gases and model parameters this method favored the more parsimonious ua model and ce models were only chosen when the ua model could not well explain observed gas concentrations only models with probability values 1 p 0 01 were accepted aeschbach hertig et al 2000 for wells with a replicate sample results for the higher probability gas model between the two samples are presented we report excess air for all models using the conventional δne term which is defined as nesamp neeq 1 100 where nesamp and neeq are the measured concentration of dissolved ne in the sample and the equilibrium concentration at the modeled ngrt respectively the δne term is reported widely in the noble gas literature as a metric of excess air because ne is assumed to derive solely from atmospheric sources and has a high analytical precision singleton moran 2010 we did not report results for samples with δne 400 excess air 50 cm3 stp kg 1 which indicates the sample was likely contaminated with air bubbles during collection or analysis cey et al 2008 3 5 statistical analysis we used basic non parametric statistics to test for correlation among continuous variables and differences among categorical groups helsel and hirsch 2002 and evaluated the significance of all hypothesis tests using a confidence level of 95 p 0 05 we used the spearman s rho test in the r package hmisc harrell jr et al 2018 to assess correlations among wellhead elevation well depth depth to top of the open interval either screen or open borehole groundwater level map maat d excess no3 n and ngrt maat additionally we used the kruskal wallis test in the r base package r core team 2018 to test for differences between these continuous variables and categorical variables associated with total coliform presence absence and groundwater age classification premodern mixed modern for the latter if the kruskal wallis test showed significant difference p 0 05 we used the post hoc dunntest with bonferroni adjusted p values to make pairwise comparisons using the r package pmcmr pohlert 2014 4 results 4 1 groundwater site characteristics wellhead elevations ranged from 100 to 2016 m although most groundwater sampling sites 77 were below elevations of 1000 m in the more densely populated portion of the study area fig 1 here we refer to wells located above 1000 m elevations as high elevation sites and below 1000 m as low elevation sites site map and maat had strong positive and negative correlations with site elevation respectively table 1 the map increased linearly from 735 mm at the lowest elevation site to near constant values of 1700 mm at high elevation sites fig 4 a while maat decreased linearly with elevation throughout the study area median and maximum well depths were 62 m and 229 m respectively with the majority 74 of well depths ranging from the minimum value of 18 m to 100 m well depth was negatively correlated with site elevation table 1 largely reflecting that the deepest up to 229 m wells are located in the low elevation part of the study area 500 m where rural population has been increasing in recent years fig 3 however some deep wells 150 m also were located at high elevations 1200 m along transportation corridors where development has also been increasing since virtually all wells in this study were finished as open boreholes in fractured bedrock depth to the top of the open interval serves as a rough proxy for depth of the unconsolidated overburden which typically is cased to prevent infill below the sanitary seal median and maximum depths to the open interval were 23 m and 122 m respectively with the majority 84 of wells ranging from the minimum value of 6 m to 50 m there was not a significant correlation between depth to open interval and wellhead elevation indicating that well construction characteristics and overburden depth are heterogeneous throughout the study area and do not correlate with the other elevation dependent variables table 1 groundwater levels were measured at 60 of the well sites and ranged from 0 07 m at site b09 where springs were reported to be present on the property by the well owner to 108 m below the land surface with a median of 12 m and 75 of measured water levels shallower than 20 m water levels only correlated with well depth and depth to top of open interval and did not correlate with the other elevation dependent variables table 1 water levels confirm a shallow vadose zone throughout the study area compared with adjacent alluvial basins and are likely lower than normal at some sites due to the preceding drought we used tritium and carbon 14 to classify groundwater samples as premodern recharged hundreds to thousands of years ago modern recharged entirely after 1950 or a mixed a mixture of modern and premodern supplementary material sm2 according to this classification system 9 30 and 61 of the wells in our study area contained premodern mixed and modern groundwater respectively fig 1b premodern groundwater was mostly confined to high elevation watershed divides except for one low elevation well b03 located upgradient from camp far west reservoir there was no discernable spatial pattern between mixed and modern samples there was no significant difference in well depth among the different age classes p 0 085 although wells with modern groundwater tended to be shallower than those with mixed or premodern groundwater supplementary material figure s1 4 2 groundwater quality the 2015 2016 gama sampling included a comprehensive water quality assessment fram et al 2017 jasper et al 2017 here we focus on no3 n and microbial indicators to determine vulnerabilities of domestic wells to contamination from surface sources nitrate is a nutrient that is often associated with anthropogenic sources such as agricultural runoff septic system leachate and wastewater treatment plant discharge burow et al 2010 groundwater no3 n ranged from non detect 0 04 mg l 1 to 5 25 mg l 1 fig 4c while no3 n was not present in the study area above the maximum contaminant level set by the u s environmental protection agency for public drinking water 10 mg l 1 20 of wells had concentrations 1 mg l 1 which is the typical threshold for natural background no3 n in groundwaters of the united states burow et al 2010 concentrations above this threshold indicate contamination by anthropogenic sources nitrate concentrations were significantly higher in modern compared to mixed p 0 006 or premodern p 0 003 groundwater supplementary material figure s2 groundwater no3 n was not detected above background levels at the high elevation sites and generally increased at lower elevations fig 4 with weak but significant correlation table 1 total coliform tc e coli ec and enterococci ent are not necessarily pathogenic but are commonly used to indicate microbial contamination u s environmental protection agency 1986 coliform bacteria are naturally present in soil and surface water but are also found in the digestive tracts of warm blooded animals and can indicate fecal contamination presence of ec and ent is a more specific indicator of water impacted by fecal waste grisey et al 2010 indicator species of tc ec and ent were present in 22 5 and 10 of the groundwater wells respectively e coli is a type of coliform bacteria and all wells that tested positive for ec also tested positive for tc there were no detections of these microbiological indicators at any of the high elevation sites and no detections of ec above 600 m fig 4d wells that tested positive for tc had significantly higher no3 n concentrations table 2 however there was not a significant relationship of either tc or no3 n to depth to the top of the open interval or water level suggesting that unsaturated overburden thickness is not an important control on the presence of surface contamination in the study area tables 1 and 2 precipitation was significantly lower for wells with tc present table 2 suggesting that rain may not be a controlling transport factor of bacteria to the well as has been reported for other settings procopio et al 2017 shuler et al 2018 however these precipitation data represent annual totals and do not integrate more complex event based dynamics such as rapid water table rise during a rainstorm into microbiologically active portions of the vadose zone presence of tc was detected in 26 and 22 of wells with modern and mixed age groundwater respectively and was absent in all wells with premodern water 4 3 stable isotopes of groundwater groundwater δ18o and δ2h ranged from 13 5 to 6 8 and 97 5 to 51 4 respectively fig 5 a groundwater d excess ranged from 3 0 to 15 4 and decreased markedly from the high elevation site mean 12 6 to 10 at lower elevations fig 4b samples with δ18o values less than 9 5 located above elevations of 700 m fall along an estimated local meteoric water line lmwl with the same slope 8 as the global meteoric water line gmwl but shifted to a d excess of 12 6 fig 4 fig 5a globally meteoric d excess values above 10 plotting above the gmwl indicate low humidity source regions or continental recycling of water vapor which would be expected for the pacific frontal systems that traverse the california coast ranges and central valley to supply moisture to the study area ingraham taylor 1991 groundwater d excess values below 10 plotting below the gmwl broadly indicate alteration of the isotopic composition of water due to evaporation especially in regions where the d excess of local precipitation exceeds the global average clark fritz 1997 approximately one quarter 26 of groundwater samples in the study area had d excess values 10 consistent with isotopic enrichment by evaporation fig 5a groundwater d excess was strongly correlated with site elevation and map fig 4a b table 1 indicating that evaporation impacted groundwaters with lower d excess values are associated with low elevation sites that receive less precipitation than high elevation portions of the study area although no groundwater sampled in this study below an elevation of 400 m had d excess 10 two 61 m deep yuba county water agency wells ycwa 09 and ycwa 10 located in the sacramento valley approximately 20 km west of the study supplementary material figure s3 were sampled in march 2006 for a prior study and had d excess values of 12 6 and 12 8 respectively california department of water resources 2008 confirming that the lwml derived from the high elevation groundwater samples is also a reasonable endmember for precipitation at low elevations within the study area fig 5a variation of meteoric δ18o and δ2h along the lwml is due to the altitude effect on equilibrium isotope fractionation causing the isotopic composition of precipitation from rising and cooling air masses to become increasingly depleted at higher elevations clark fritz 1997 the approximate δ18o elevation lapse slope for our study area based on regression of regional precipitation data is 2 8 km 1 lechler niemi 2011 we assumed the intercept of the lapse trend to be 7 5 at sea level 0 m which represents the amount weighted annual mean of precipitation δ18o in the southwestern sacramento valley where storm tracks traverse before rising over the sierra nevada range criss davisson 1996 the ycwa well data support this precipitation derived lapse intercept with groundwater δ18o values of 7 7 and 7 6 at elevations of 19 and 16 m respectively fig 5b groundwater δ18o closely tracked the estimated lapse rate trend due to inputs from meteoric sources with altitude dependent isotopic signatures fig 5b groundwater δ18o residuals horizontal offset from the lapse trend in fig 5b ranged from 1 0 to 1 2 with a central tendency of zero respective mean and median of residuals was 0 04 and 0 05 below the analytical error and 86 falling within 0 5 groundwater site elevation residuals vertical offset from the lapse rate in fig 5b ranged from 372 to 416 m with a central tendency close to zero respective mean and median of residuals was 17 m and 14 m and 89 falling within 200 m these data indicate that precipitation sourcing groundwater recharge is extremely local to respective study sites there were no statistically significant differences among d excess values for the different groundwater age classes p 0 261 however all but one of the low d excess samples were of either modern or mixed age supplementary material figure s4 water quality indicators of surface contamination were significantly related to d excess with higher no3 n concentrations and tc detection frequency associated with lower d excess values tables 1 and 2 the highest no3 n groundwaters also tested positive for tc and were located in the lower elevation portions of the study region where groundwater d excess was close to or 10 fig 6 4 4 stable isotopes of surface water and river temperatures surface water δ18o and δ2h from the main stems of the yuba and bear rivers ranged from 12 9 to 7 9 and 96 6 to 61 6 respectively with river temperatures ranging from 2 c to 26 c fig 5a supplementary material table s1 and figure s5 waters from the yuba and bear rivers had a similar central tendency both groups had identical values for median δ18o of 11 3 but the bear river had slightly more depleted and enriched values than the yuba river at up and down gradient sites respectively supplementary material figure s6 this could be due to the fact that the bear river sampling was more temporally extensive than the yuba which was not sampled through much of 2003 supplementary material figure s5 river waters that followed the gmwl plotted at the lower end of the groundwater δ18o spectrum and fell considerably below the lapse trend fig 5 this large vertical offset is due to the influence of runoff from higher elevation 1500 m portions of the study area that is derived in large part from snowmelt and ranges from 15 to 12 ingraham taylor 1991 river waters had d excess values ranging from 4 5 to 12 with 88 below 10 due to the near ubiquitous effects of evaporation on bear and yuba river water surface water samples from the camp far west reservoir cfwr and the adjacent dairy farm mine pit lake had δ18o values ranging from 10 8 to 4 5 supplementary material table s2 and define a local evaporation line for the cfwr area with a slope of 4 6 fig 5a consistent with expected evaporation line slopes for surface waters in the study region 4 5 gibson et al 2008 the cfwr evaporation line intersects the gmwl at δ18o value of 11 7 similar to the median value of the aggregate river water dataset the dairy farm mine pit lake captures overflow from the cfwr and includes the most evaporated endmembers of high elevation source waters conveyed by the bear river dry season samples from sites along the bear river located both above and below the cfwr b3 and b4 fell along the cfwr evaporation line with δ18o values ranging from approximately 10 5 to 7 9 samples from b3 were also likely impacted by evaporative processes occurring in the up gradient combie reservoir high elevation mine pit lakes are also included here to constrain the variability and extent of surface water evaporation on the isotopic composition of standing surface waters throughout the study area and plotted both above and below the cfwr evaporation line with δ18o values ranging up to approximately 3 0 supplementary material table s2 figure s6 time series of samples collected each month along the bear river for one year showed that river temperature and δ18o generally increased while d excess decreased with distance downstream due to the cumulative effects of surface warming and evaporation on surface waters moving through open channels and reservoirs fig 7 river water δ18o and d excess showed a distinct seasonal pattern respectively decreasing and increasing in response to meteoric inputs during the winter wet season through spring snowmelt at the onset of the dry season δ18o and d excess respectively increased and decreased due to evaporation throughout the summer and into the fall with a peak separation of δ18o values between upstream and downstream sites of about 3 5 in november there was a temporal lag between peak δ18o peak and peak river temperature with the latter occurring 3 4 months earlier during the middle of the dry season this is likely due to complex mixing dynamics in open channels and reservoirs long term memory effects of mixing with evaporated water stored in abundant reservoirs can also explain why regional river waters fall beneath local and global meteoric trends even following snowmelt when river δ18o and d excess values are clearly impacted by substantial influxes of meteoric runoff figs 5a 7 4 5 monte carlo mixing model analysis in order to extend the above results and heuristically evaluate recharge sources and associated mixing fractions for evaporation impacted groundwater we developed a simple 2 component base mixing model assuming low d excess groundwater samples could be explained by mixing of local precipitation and an unknown regional surface water endmember we modeled the 20 samples with d excess 10 that were most clearly impacted by evaporative processes we estimated the δ18o and δ2h of local precipitation δl at each sample site using the wellhead elevation study area lapse rate and the lmwl fig 5 table 3 next we extrapolated a mixing line connecting the δl endmember with its corresponding sampled groundwater value δgw in δ space to a point of intersection with the camp far west reservoir evaporation line defining an evaporated surface water endmember δsw for a given site at that point fig 8 a we then evaluated the fraction of surface water in the groundwater sample nsw using the following modification of the two component mixing equation given by faure 1998 δgw δl δsw δl for detailed model equations see supplementary material sm3 results from the base model show that mixing proportions from surface water sources resembling cfwr and dry season bear river water ranged from 11 to 63 with a mean of 31 across the 20 modeled samples table 4 since the above modeling approach is fundamentally limited by uncertainties in the δl and δsw endmembers we used a monte carlo simulation to explore the effects of parameter uncertainty on the base model e g arendt et al 2015 we generated 10 000 potential combinations of four model parameters by randomly sampling uniform distributions bounded by physically reasonable parameter ranges table 3 the intercept of the lapse trend equation b18z and lmwl intercept blmwl parameters determine the composition of the δl endmember and were randomly varied from the base model values by 0 3 and 1 0 respectively based on the standard deviations of the unevaporated groundwater samples from the lapse trend and lmwl fig 8b the δsw endmember depends on the evaporation line slope mlel and the δ18o value of its intersection point with the gmwl δi we allowed the mlel to vary randomly between 3 and 5 representing the potential range of evaporative slopes for soil and surface waters in study region gibson et al 2008 and the δi values from 13 0 to 10 8 covering the range of observed regional surface waters plotting along the gmwl fig 5a further discussion of model parameters and sensitivity analysis is included in supplementary material sm4 models were considered to fail when the estimated δsw endmember fell outside of the range of observed isotopic values for regional surface waters in the study area δ18o from 13 to 3 and estimated mixing fractions were discarded thirteen of the 20 modeled samples exclusively produced δsw values within the acceptable range and had model failure rates of 0 table 4 only four samples had model failure rates 10 b02 b04 b06 b09 three out of these four samples b02 b06 b09 had measured δgw values that were enriched from corresponding δl endmembers in δ space with slopes between 3 and 5 in 15 26 of sample model scenarios and could therefore be explained by evaporation of local rain for those particular parameter combinations table 4 it is worthy of note that well b09 had a water level 7 cm below the land surface at the time of sampling and could have easily be impacted near surface evaporation of local rain in ponded or waterlogged soils no other samples had isotopic compositions that could be explained by evaporation of local rain given the modeled parameter ranges of the accepted models estimated δsw values covered a broad range of potential evaporation trends in δ space encompassing the observed range of evaporated samples within the yuba and bear river watersheds fig 8b evaporated samples from cfwr and bear river sites fell within a 95 probability region calculated from the highest marginal posterior density for all accepted model δsw values which was estimated using a bivariate kernel density smoothing algorithm bolker 2019 the majority of dry season bear river and cfwr samples fell within the highest density probability region in δ space which encompassed 50 of all accepted modeled δsw values this shows that given the uncertainty in the δl endmember and the assumption that samples mixed with an evaporation impacted source water of high elevation origin the most probable δsw endmember for the ensemble dataset closely resembles evaporation trends consistent with surface waters along the bear river that have undergone extensive evaporation in open channels and reservoirs with high elevation catchments of the accepted models surface water mixing percentages ranged from 4 to 84 table 4 normal statistical moments can often be used to characterize monte carlo mixing models arendt et al 2015 and in this case though distributions of sample surface water mixing fractions were non gaussian model output distributions had strong central tendencies sample means for surface water mixing percentages were only 0 2 higher than respective medians and standard deviations were generally within 10 of the mean and only 1 5 lower than the span of respective interquartile ranges q3 q1 table 4 mixing proportions for the base model were generally higher than the monte carlo median mean values but within the interquartile range fig 9 the monte carlo mean standard deviation for surface water mixing percentages for the 20 individual samples ranged from 12 4 to 58 9 table 4 the mean standard deviation of surface water mixing percentages for all accepted mixing models across the 20 different samples was 28 13 monte carlo simulation results should be interpreted with caution modeled surface water endmembers and mixing fractions are probabilistic representations based on model assumptions and endmember parameter uncertainty however this modeling approach is useful because it demonstrates that evaporation of local precipitation is an extremely unlikely source of the low d excess groundwater signal and constrains the extent to which native groundwater could have mixed with regional surface waters of high elevation origin 4 6 noble gas recharge temperatures measured dissolved noble gas results for groundwater ne ar kr and xe and additional model inputs are included in the usgs data release of levy and faulkner 2019 groundwater ngrt ranged from 2 4 c to 21 4 c with mean errors of 0 9 c and generally decreased with elevation fig 10 table 5 model probabilities ranged from 1 to 99 with a median of 58 table 5 no models were removed due to low probability values excess air expressed as δne ranged from 2 to 369 with a median value of 43 table 5 the sample from well y09 had δne 400 and was omitted from these results although high values of δne 100 have been associated with fractured rock aquifers where rapid water table fluctuations can lead to elevated excess air concentrations the majority 85 of modeled samples had δne 100 samples with δne 100 occurred at both low and high elevation sites 245 to 1650 m and were within the range measured in other montane fractured rock aquifers e g manning caine 2007 although lapse trends for precipitation weighted maat and maat had similar slopes 4 6 c km 1 and 4 7 c km 1 respectively the former had a lower intercept 12 5 c than the latter 17 4 c because most of the precipitation in the study area occurs during the winter when temperatures are cooler than the annual average fig 10 high elevation sites preferentially tracked the lapse rate for the precipitation weighted maat we detrended the ngrt by subtracting the maat to better understand how recharge temperatures vary with respect to the maat over the elevation gradient of the study area detrended ngrt values ranged from 6 4 c below the maat at high elevation and exceeded the maat by 0 6 to 4 8 c at eight low elevation sites fig 10 table 5 the detrended ngrt had a significant correlation with elevation and the other elevation correlated variables and was most strongly correlated with d excess table 1 suggesting a linkage between the groundwater evaporation signal and warmer recharge temperatures co located at low elevations since ngrt models are sensitive to changes in recharge elevation we did a model sensitivity analysis by increasing the recharge elevation of the initial model by 400 m which is approximately the maximum elevation residual of groundwater δ18o from the stable isotope lapse rate fig 5a modeled ngrt values at 400 m from the wellhead elevation were only 1 0 c to 1 7 c cooler than the base model with slopes of relation 4 2 c km 1 to 2 7 c km 1 that were only slightly higher than maat and precipitation weighted maat lapse rates supplementary material figure s7 this suggests that even if the sampled groundwater did recharge at a substantially higher elevation which is unlikely for most samples considering how closely the data follow the stable isotope lapse trend it would not greatly change the interpretation of ngrt values with respect the atmospheric lapse rate trends modeled ngrt values close to the precipitation weighted maat are likely due to rapid recharge of precipitation equilibrated to cool ambient air temperatures during the winter wet season values of ngrt between the precipitation weighted maat and maat at low elevation sites could either be due to higher proportions of warmer season recharge or longer residence times in the vadose zone where the temperature of recharge typically approaches the mean ground temperature typically 0 3 c greater than the maat at depth as it infiltrates to the water table e g stute schlosser 2000 however these sites did not show concomitant increases of detrended ngrt with depth to the open interval or water level table 1 which would both be linked longer vadose zone transit times soil temperatures at 10 and 15 cm depths from the noaa esrl meteorological station 14 km northeast of nevada city at an elevation of 1055 m closely tracked air temperatures from 2011 to 2019 showing a slight attenuation of signal amplitude with depth supplementary material figure s8 at these shallow depths mean and precipitation weighted mean annual soil temperatures were within a degree cooler than those of the air suggesting that average air temperatures are a reasonable approximation for those of the shallow ground in the study region seasonal variations of shallow ground temperature typically attenuate with depth and approach the maat plus any additional geothermal heating anderson 2005 assuming a regional geothermal gradient of 25 c km 1 segal et al 2014 geothermal heating at the depths to groundwater levels measured in this study could result in ground temperatures exceeding the maat by 0 4 c on average and up to 2 7 c at the deepest water level however at low elevations where ngrt was highest geothermal heating could only account for 0 0 1 5 c at measured water table depths and thus could not explain the higher ngrt values the most likely explanation for ngrt values exceeding the maat at low elevations is recharge during the summer dry season when seasonal temperatures exceed the annual mean since virtually no precipitation occurs during the dry season surface water is the primary source of recharge to bedrock aquifers during these times six out of the eight samples with ngrt values higher than the maat also had d excess values 10 corroborating evidence of recharge from surface water sources the mean of all measured dry season june september river water temperatures at each of the yuba and bear river sampling sites ranged from 14 c to 24 c corresponding with the elevation and temperature ranges of the warmest ngrt values fig 10 supplementary material figure s9 5 discussion 5 1 sources and seasonality of groundwater recharge determining sources of recharge to fractured rock aquifers is critical to predict vulnerabilities of montane water supplies to climate change meixner et al 2016 groundwater from domestic wells in the yuba and bear river watersheds closely tracked δ18o and precipitation weighted maat lapse trends which suggests that rapid and local meteoric recharge is prevalent throughout the study area this finding is consistent with other studies of recharge to fractured rock aquifers abbott et al 2000 gleeson et al 2009 although mixing with premodern groundwater is apparent throughout the study area fig 1c isotopic studies of eocene gravels in the yuba river suggest that paleoclimatic lapse rates were similar to those observed in modern precipitation and would not substantially shift groundwater samples away from modern lapse trends mulch et al 2006 in a contrasting geological setting peters et al 2018 showed groundwater sampled across a broad elevation gradient on mount shasta northern california had δ18o and ngrt values that fell substantially below lapse trends and likely traveled 1000 vertical meters along deep subsurface flowpaths before reaching lower elevation discharge zones in the northern sierra nevada foothills local geology does not support the formation of elevation driven intermediate and regional flow systems sensu tóth 1963 because major faults and fractures along which groundwater travels are oriented roughly perpendicular to the regional elevation gradient recharge originating at local topographic highs throughout the study area likely discharges towards adjacent deeply incised river valleys fig 1b alternately the volcanic setting of mount shasta is more conducive to long range subsurface flow through high permeability igneous structures oriented parallel to the regional topographic slope peters et al 2018 the geologic setting of our study area also influences recharge rates as evidenced from the noble gas data other studies of high elevation montane recharge in the nearby lake tahoe area reported ngrt values much closer to the local maat singleton moran 2010 segal et al 2014 however those measurements were made in alluvial basins where slower recharge rates through unconsolidated sediments allow more time for infiltrating water to equilibrate to the ground temperature maat at depth in the vadose zone stute schlosser 2000 conversely rapid infiltration through bedrock fractures can quickly isolate recharge waters from atmospheric gases thereby preserving seasonal recharge signals e g plummer et al 2001 this is most clearly shown in our study by ngrt values which fall along the precipitation weighted lapse trends fig 10 signifying rapid seasonal recharge during the winter when the bulk of annual precipitation occurs fig 2 manning and solomon 2003 observed a similar offset of ngrt values from the maat lapse trend to one of near identical slope but lower intercept in an alpine fractured rock aquifer where recharge occurs predominantly during spring snowmelt the most striking feature of these data is the presence of low d excess groundwaters at low elevation sites which we interpret as a conservative tracer of mixing with surface waters sourced from high elevation catchments although evaporation processes such as sub cloud evaporation of rain e g salamakilis et al 2016 and soil water evaporation e g sprenger et al 2016 could affect the d excess of local rain infiltrating warmer and drier low elevation sites these processes do not typically affect the isotopic composition of groundwater recharge except in some in arid regions with deep vadose zones and are not likely to be important in the study area where the vast majority of precipitation rapidly infiltrates shallow soil columns during the cool and humid wet season evaristo et al 2015 sprenger et al 2016 additionally only a few of the low d excess groundwater samples could be explained by evaporation of local precipitation in monte carlo mixing simulations table 4 therefore the most likely source of low d excess groundwater at low elevation within the study area is mixing with evaporated surface waters from higher elevation sources there are three primary sources of surface water that could contribute to groundwater recharge in the study area local tributaries regional rivers and diversions for human use local tributaries in the study area also tend to have d excess values 10 but δ18o values closer to local precipitation because they source waters from sub catchments that are hydrologically disconnected from isotopically depleted headwaters soltero 2013 2018 additionally local tributaries are typically ephemeral at low elevations with peak flows during the wet season this is inconsistent with stable isotope and ngrt results at low elevation sites that support mixing with high elevation source waters that are isotopically fractionated by surface evaporation and recharge during the dry season it is also unlikely that direct seepage from regional rivers could cause such a spatially distributed recharge signal across the low elevation study sites because they flow through deeply incised channels that span a limited extent of the study area and cannot possibly supply recharge to intervening highlands fig 1 at low elevations however large volumes of regional river water sourced from high elevation catchments are diverted for local use through widespread networks of earthen ditches and canals only a portion of which are mapped in fig 1c where flow increases during dry times in response to human demand fig 2 although several water districts deliver surface waters to low elevation portions of the study area the nid is the largest and its service area roughly corresponds to the area of low elevation sites with low d excess groundwater elevated ngrt values and surface contamination indicators figs 1c 6 and 10 the nid diverts bear river water for human use within and to the south of the study area and we interpret isotopic signatures from sites b1 to b4 to be broadly representative of the diverted river endmember which becomes isotopically enriched due to evaporation as it travels from high to low elevation through extensive water distribution infrastructure figs 7 and 8 regional river water diverted for human use could recharge bedrock aquifers either by direct application of irrigation water to the land surface or seepage from distribution infrastructure e g unlined ditches and canals the most substantial deliveries of nid irrigation water by acreage are forage pasture 69 and family garden orchard 21 brown and caldwell 2016 historic deliveries of raw irrigation water by the nid to the deer creek service area fig 1c are approximately 52 000 acre ft yr 1 to 42 000 irrigated acres tables 4 3 and 4 5 from kleinschmidt associates 2011 equaling approximately 355 mm of irrigation water per year spread out across the lower reaches of the study area normal annual precipitation minus aet at low elevation sites ranged from approximately 1000 mm at elevations near 1000 m to 285 mm at the lowest elevation site flint flint 2014 therefore irrigation water could ostensibly comprise from 27 1000 m elevations to 56 100 m elevations of the total water available for recharge across the climate gradient of the low elevation sites this could also explain why the d excess signal is so much weaker at higher elevations within the nid service area in addition to the fact that evaporative enrichment of regional river water becomes more pronounced as it travels through distribution infrastructure from high to low elevation fig 7 although direct application of irrigation water to the land surface is clearly an important pathway for diverted river recharge it is also important to consider seepage from the distribution infrastructure while the volume of irrigation water applied directly to the land surface within the study area is quantitatively important with respect to the recharge budget as shown above much of this water is dispersed over large areas and may not overcome the soil moisture deficit to recharge underlying aquifers seepage studies on canals within the study area using both isotopic tracers and numerical modeling have shown that leakage from unlined channels can saturate the underlying vadose zone and seep vertically into fractured bedrock thereby forming a direct hydrologic connection to the underlying aquifer hydrofocus 2003 2010 further seepage rates below canals have been shown to increase during periods of high stage that occur when human demand peaks during dry times the nid typically assumes conveyance seepage losses of 15 on raw water deliveries kleinschmidt associates 2011 therefore using the above estimate for raw water deliveries distribution infrastructure seepage alone could account for 6 1000 m elevations to 28 100 m elevations of the water available for recharge across the climate gradient of the low elevation study sites and is likely even greater with proximity to ditches and canals hydrofocus 2010 used stable isotopes of water to show that wells located up to 300 m downslope from an nid canal located at elevations 1000 m contained an average of 32 canal water based on the above discussion we propose the following conceptual model for the hydrogeology of our study area during wet and dry conditions during wet times groundwater is predominantly replenished by local precipitation that rapidly recharges aquifers through bedrock fractures fig 11 a during dry times regional water tables drop and flow through water distribution infrastructure increases to meet demand in a reversal of the natural flow regime fig 2 increased application of irrigation water at the land surface and seepage from unlined ditches and canals thereby can become a much more substantial portion of the recharge budget at low elevations during drought fig 11b 5 2 vulnerability of the groundwater resource both quantity and quality of groundwater resources are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change green et al 2011 expansion of the rural residential population in the study area over the past 50 years has put increasing stress on the fractured bedrock aquifer fig 3 which is most vulnerable to drought at high elevations where recharge is derived primarily from local precipitation the prevalence of modern groundwater throughout the study area also suggests that groundwater storage is transient and deep stores of premodern fossil water are not available to buffer supplies during drought fig 1b although our results suggest low elevation groundwater supplies can be buffered by surface water subsidies during dry times fig 11b water quality vulnerabilities may become more pronounced with increasing reliance on surface water sources our results show that groundwater in our study area is susceptible to microbial and no3 n contamination at low elevations fig 4 presence of tc ec and ent in groundwater can be caused by mixing with surface water septic leachate agricultural recharge runoff and supported by biofilms growing on well casings screens or pumps jamieson et al 2002 pandey et al 2014 somaratne hallas 2015 direct connection of bacteria in groundwater wells to surface water sources has been inferred by physiographic setting and microbial taxonomy conboy goss 2000 somaratne hallas 2015 as well as observed directly using isotopic tracers shuler et al 2018 geology is an important control on the susceptibility of domestic wells to microbial contamination in a survey of domestic wells across the united states embrey and runkle 2006 found higher detection frequencies for coliform bacteria in carbonate or crystalline rock aquifers than those composed of unconsolidated sediments this is consistent with a wide body of literature showing that pathogenic bacteria are better attenuated in recharge moving through high porosity media with longer residence times compared to rapid preferential flow through fractures and macropores pandey et al 2014 prior studies of domestic wells in the sierra nevada foothills have found bacterial indicators to be of concern with detection frequencies 25 similar to our findings california state water resources control board 2005 2010 in this study higher detection frequencies for tc were associated with groundwater that received inputs from diverted surface water table 2 fig 6 coliform bacteria particularly ec occur widely in surface waters of our study area brown and caldwell 2016 starr palencia 2017 three out of the four springs sampled in this study tested positive for tc including two in the headwaters of the north yuba river suggesting tc may be a fairly broad indicator of surface water sources in the study area however the co occurrence of elevated no3 n with tc at low elevation sites supports more specific anthropogenic contamination sources including septic leachate irrigation return flows or seepage of untreated surface water from ditches and canals table 2 fig 6 5 3 implications for integrated water resources management the human component of the hydrologic cycle needs to be quantified to forecast the impacts of climate change on water resources taylor et al 2012 previous studies have examined the impacts of suburban development on runoff generation and groundwater recharge burns et al 2005 irrigation and groundwater abstraction on aquifer geochemistry jurgens et al 2009 ayotte et al 2011 and return flows related to groundwater surface water interactions fernald et al 2010 visser et al 2018 however few studies have reported the effects of climate change on paired surface and groundwater resources that are intensively managed for domestic use rather climate change impacts are typically modeled on representative natural systems to reduce uncertainties associated with the human component of the water cycle e g flint flint 2014 godsey et al 2014 or heavily irrigated agricultural systems where focused effects on the recharge budget are extremely pronounced e g toews allen 2009 condon maxwell 2014 here we illuminate the impacts of distributed surface water development and drought on groundwater resources in a rural residential setting where re plumbing of the natural hydrologic system has substantially altered sources and seasonality of groundwater recharge fig 11 return flows associated with surface water development are potentially a double edged sword and could both enhance recharge during drought and introduce water quality vulnerabilities associated with rapid infiltration of untreated surface waters additionally since recharge to fractured bedrock aquifers in the sierra nevada foothills is highly localized land use planning for source protection and recharge enhancement in this and other similar settings should be focused close to the wellhead hydrologic models and climate mitigation planning for such resources should focus on predicted changes to seasonal rainfall patterns as opposed to snowmelt volume and timing since recharge from the latter will depend more on secondary effects of reservoir and streamflow regulation in intensively managed headwater catchments given that population is expected to increase by nearly 85 in the northern sierra nevada foothills between 2000 and 2050 cosumnes american bear yuba integrated regional water management group 2014 it is of extreme importance to understand the impacts of increased human demand on paired groundwater and surface water supplies and how these resources are fundamentally connected winter et al 1998 6 conclusions we made a detailed geochemical survey of domestic wells in the sierra nevada foothills to determine sources of recharge and associated vulnerability of groundwater supply from fractured rock aquifers during historic drought stable isotopes of water and ngrt values closely tracked atmospheric lapse trends suggesting that groundwater inputs in the study region are dominated by local precipitation that recharges fractured bedrock rapidly during the winter wet season however samples from wells with water isotope signatures that were fractionated by evaporation and elevated ngrt likely contained a component of dry season recharge from diverted surface waters both irrigation return flows and seepage from extensive water distribution infrastructure throughout low elevation irrigation districts are potential sources of the surface water signal and would logically increase in the dry season and drought when human demand is high monte carlo isotope mixing models show that evaporation impacted samples are likely mixtures of local rain with an average of 28 13 from diverted river water from high elevation catchments groundwater wells impacted by mixing with diverted surface waters tended to have elevated levels of nitrate and coliform bacteria compared to those replenished exclusively by local precipitation high elevation wells reliant on precipitation for recharge are more vulnerable to supply shortage during drought whereas low elevation wells that receive recharge subsidies from diverted surface waters are more susceptible to water quality degradation the impacts of human alterations to the water cycle are important to consider for both groundwater and surface water to forecast vulnerabilities of paired

5688,climate change is expected to reduce recharge to montane aquifers in the western united states but it is unclear how this will impact groundwater resources in watersheds where intensive surface water development has disrupted the natural hydrologic regime to better understand sources of recharge and associated vulnerabilities of groundwater supply in this setting we made a detailed geochemical survey of domestic wells finished in fractured bedrock throughout the yuba and bear river watersheds sierra nevada foothills northern california during historic drought 2015 2016 stable isotopes of water and noble gas recharge temperatures closely tracked atmospheric lapse rates across a broad elevation gradient 100 2000 m indicating groundwater inputs are dominated by local precipitation that rapidly recharges fractured bedrock during the winter wet season however nearly one quarter of wells had water isotopes that were fractionated by evaporation and warm recharge

recharge subsidies from diverted surface water had elevated levels of nitrate and coliform bacteria compared to those replenished exclusively by local precipitation which are more vulnerable to supply

aquifer recharge dynamics and the associated sustainability of already stressed subsurface water supplies döll 2009 green et al 2011 in addition to direct effects on precipitation and temperature climate change is also expected to have substantial impacts on the seasonality of groundwater surface water interactions as well as groundwater abstraction and return flows associated with irrigated

assess the impacts of drought on groundwater supply reliability in a region where a high density of rural households depend on fractured bedrock aquifers for drinking water johnson belitz 2015 because the elevation of the study area spans a broad range fig 1b water isotope and noble gas tracers provide powerful tools to understand sources and pathways of groundwater recharge to fractured bedrock on a regional scale here we couple analyses of these geochemical tracers with select indicators of surface contamination from the broader water quality assessment with the objectives 1 to identify sources and seasonality of groundwater recharge to fractured bedrock in highly developed montane watersheds 2 to determine associated vulnerabilities to domestic groundwater supply quantity and

at various laboratories following methods and quality control protocols described by jasper et al 2017 samples were analyzed for stable isotopes of water δ18o δ2h at the usgs reston stable isotope laboratory rsil reporting units for stable isotopes of water are in delta δ notation where the ratio of stable isotopes of oxygen 18o 16o or hydrogen 2h 1h in the sample r is related to the ratio of those isotopes in the reference vienna standard mean ocean water rvsmow so that δ r rvsmow 1 1000 clark fritz 1997 analyses for δ18o and δ2h were made using dual inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometry following methods described in révész and coplen 2008 with respective analytical precisions of 0 2 and 2 however in practice reproducibility of measurements was much more precise with absolute differences among replicate sample pairs ranging from 0 00 to 0 07 mean of 0 03 for δ18o and 0 2 2 0 mean of 0 8 for δ2h in this study we summarize water isotope results in terms of d excess which is defined as δ2h 8δ18o dansgaard 1964 a d excess value lower than that of precipitation providing the trend for isotopes in precipitation has a slope of 8 in δ space is indicative of the effects of kinetic isotope fractionation due to evaporation samples were collected for dissolved noble gases ne ar kr xe in 10 ml copper tubes with care to avoid inclusion of air bubbles that were subsequently clamped to seal off from the atmosphere cey et al 2008 samples were analyzed at the lawrence livermore national laboratory llnl noble gas mass spectrometry facility following methods described by cey et al 2008 analytical precision was approximately 2 for ne and ar and 3 for kr and xe relative percent differences for measured noble gas concentrations between field replicate pairs were within 13 5 8 and 9 for ne ar kr and xe respectively except for one where the replicate showed evidence of sample degassing during collection or analysis and was not considered in calculation of groundwater recharge temperatures 3 3 surface water sampling and analysis to characterize the variability of surface water δ18o and δ2h in the study area over space and time we present here a dataset of 126 river water samples collected by the usgs between january 2000 and december 2002 at eight locations fig 1c four along the yuba river y1 y4 and four along the bear river b1 b4 at elevations ranging from 45 to 664 m the regional pdsi mostly oscillated between 1 0 and 3 0 during this time period indicating abnormally dry to severe drought conditions similar to those under which groundwater samples were collected a detailed timeseries of samples was taken monthly at the four bear river sites which are variously upstream and downstream from three major reservoirs rollins combie and camp far west fig 1c between december 2001 and december 2002 all samples were depth and width integrated with respect to the river channel and collected using sampling protocols described in the usgs national field manual u s geological survey variously dated depth and width integrated river temperatures were measured in situ additionally to characterize evaporative processes affecting the isotopic composition of standing surface water bodies in the yuba and bear watersheds stable isotope data is included here for 68 samples from a detailed sampling survey of the camp far west reservoir cfwr and the adjacent dairy farm mine pit lake in the lower portion of the bear river watershed elevation 80 m the samples were collected between from october 2001 through august 2003 at depths of 0 2 46 m below the water surface at various sites within and around the reservoir as detailed by alpers et al 2008 grab samples were taken from three high elevation 2360 3080 m mine pit lakes in the yuba river watershed from december 1999 to august 2000 all surface water samples were analyzed for δ18o and δ2h at the university of california davis as described by alpers et al 2008 while regional surface water data presented in this study were collected 15 years before the groundwater survey they are useful to broadly characterize the regional surface water endmember within the modern period of surface water regulation and were sampled under similar climate conditions 3 4 noble gas recharge temperature modeling we modeled noble gas recharge temperature ngrt using concentrations of dissolved ne kr ar and xe the concentrations of these noble gases in groundwater depend primarily on conditions determining equilibrium solubility at the water table during recharge temperature pressure and salinity and excess air i e air bubbles trapped below the water table that subsequently dissolve stute schlosser 2000 we used a numerical solution to determine best fit model parameters based on a weighted non linear least squares parameter estimation routine e g ballentine hall 1999 aeschbach hertig et al 1999 with either an unfractionated excess air ua model heaton vogel 1981 which requires a parameter for excess air or a closed system equilibration ce model aeschbach hertig et al 2000 which requires an additional fractionation parameter model fits were based on optimization of the chi squared test statistic χ 2 which quantifies misfits between observed and modeled gas concentrations aeschbach hertig et al 2000 model parameter error was quantified using the variance covariance matrix for ua model fits and monte carlo simulations for the ce based on the analytical error of dissolved gas concentrations as described by levy and faulkner 2019 we computed ngrt values for the 72 wells with acceptable noble gas data using both ua and ce models and estimated recharge salinity and pressure values based on sample tds and wellhead elevation respectively levy faulkner 2019 we selected gas models for each sample based on which had the higher χ 2 probability which was calculated using the χ 2 distribution test statistic and the degrees of freedom difference between number of gases and model parameters this method favored the more parsimonious ua model and ce models were only chosen when the ua model could not well explain observed gas concentrations only models with probability values 1 p 0 01 were accepted aeschbach hertig et al 2000 for wells with a replicate sample results for the higher probability gas model between the two samples are presented we report excess air for all models using the conventional δne term which is defined as nesamp neeq 1 100 where nesamp and neeq are the measured concentration of dissolved ne in the sample and the equilibrium concentration at the modeled ngrt respectively the δne term is reported widely in the noble gas literature as a metric of excess air because ne is assumed to derive solely from atmospheric sources and has a high analytical precision singleton moran 2010 we did not report results for samples with δne 400 excess air 50 cm3 stp kg 1 which indicates the sample was likely contaminated with air bubbles during collection or analysis cey et al 2008 3 5 statistical analysis we used basic non parametric statistics to test for correlation among continuous variables and differences among categorical groups helsel and hirsch 2002 and evaluated the significance of all hypothesis tests using a confidence level of 95 p 0 05 we used the spearman s rho test in the r package hmisc harrell jr et al 2018 to assess correlations among wellhead elevation well depth depth to top of the open interval either screen or open borehole groundwater level map maat d excess no3 n and ngrt maat additionally we used the kruskal wallis test in the r base package r core team 2018 to test for differences between these continuous variables and categorical variables associated with total coliform presence absence and groundwater age classification premodern mixed modern for the latter if the kruskal wallis test showed significant difference p 0 05 we used the post hoc dunntest with bonferroni adjusted p values to make pairwise comparisons using the r package pmcmr pohlert 2014 4 results 4 1 groundwater site characteristics wellhead elevations ranged from 100 to 2016 m although most groundwater sampling sites 77 were below elevations of 1000 m in the more densely populated portion of the study area fig 1 here we refer to wells located above 1000 m elevations as high elevation sites and below 1000 m as low elevation sites site map and maat had strong positive and negative correlations with site elevation respectively table 1 the map increased linearly from 735 mm at the lowest elevation site to near constant values of 1700 mm at high elevation sites fig 4 a while maat decreased linearly with elevation throughout the study area median and maximum well depths were 62 m and 229 m respectively with the majority 74 of well depths ranging from the minimum value of 18 m to 100 m well depth was negatively correlated with site elevation table 1 largely reflecting that the deepest up to 229 m wells are located in the low elevation part of the study area 500 m where rural population has been increasing in recent years fig 3 however some deep wells 150 m also were located at high elevations 1200 m along transportation corridors where development has also been increasing since virtually all wells in this study were finished as open boreholes in fractured bedrock depth to the top of the open interval serves as a rough proxy for depth of the unconsolidated overburden which typically is cased to prevent infill below the sanitary seal median and maximum depths to the open interval were 23 m and 122 m respectively with the majority 84 of wells ranging from the minimum value of 6 m to 50 m there was not a significant correlation between depth to open interval and wellhead elevation indicating that well construction characteristics and overburden depth are heterogeneous throughout the study area and do not correlate with the other elevation dependent variables table 1 groundwater levels were measured at 60 of the well sites and ranged from 0 07 m at site b09 where springs were reported to be present on the property by the well owner to 108 m below the land surface with a median of 12 m and 75 of measured water levels shallower than 20 m water levels only correlated with well depth and depth to top of open interval and did not correlate with the other elevation dependent variables table 1 water levels confirm a shallow vadose zone throughout the study area compared with adjacent alluvial basins and are likely lower than normal at some sites due to the preceding drought we used tritium and carbon 14 to classify groundwater samples as premodern recharged hundreds to thousands of years ago modern recharged entirely after 1950 or a mixed a mixture of modern and premodern supplementary material sm2 according to this classification system 9 30 and 61 of the wells in our study area contained premodern mixed and modern groundwater respectively fig 1b premodern groundwater was mostly confined to high elevation watershed divides except for one low elevation well b03 located upgradient from camp far west reservoir there was no discernable spatial pattern between mixed and modern samples there was no significant difference in well depth among the different age classes p 0 085 although wells with modern groundwater tended to be shallower than those with mixed or premodern groundwater supplementary material figure s1 4 2 groundwater quality the 2015 2016 gama sampling included a comprehensive water quality assessment fram et al 2017 jasper et al 2017 here we focus on no3 n and microbial indicators to determine vulnerabilities of domestic wells to contamination from surface sources nitrate is a nutrient that is often associated with anthropogenic sources such as agricultural runoff septic system leachate and wastewater treatment plant discharge burow et al 2010 groundwater no3 n ranged from non detect 0 04 mg l 1 to 5 25 mg l 1 fig 4c while no3 n was not present in the study area above the maximum contaminant level set by the u s environmental protection agency for public drinking water 10 mg l 1 20 of wells had concentrations 1 mg l 1 which is the typical threshold for natural background no3 n in groundwaters of the united states burow et al 2010 concentrations above this threshold indicate contamination by anthropogenic sources nitrate concentrations were significantly higher in modern compared to mixed p 0 006 or premodern p 0 003 groundwater supplementary material figure s2 groundwater no3 n was not detected above background levels at the high elevation sites and generally increased at lower elevations fig 4 with weak but significant correlation table 1 total coliform tc e coli ec and enterococci ent are not necessarily pathogenic but are commonly used to indicate microbial contamination u s environmental protection agency 1986 coliform bacteria are naturally present in soil and surface water but are also found in the digestive tracts of warm blooded animals and can indicate fecal contamination presence of ec and ent is a more specific indicator of water impacted by fecal waste grisey et al 2010 indicator species of tc ec and ent were present in 22 5 and 10 of the groundwater wells respectively e coli is a type of coliform bacteria and all wells that tested positive for ec also tested positive for tc there were no detections of these microbiological indicators at any of the high elevation sites and no detections of ec above 600 m fig 4d wells that tested positive for tc had significantly higher no3 n concentrations table 2 however there was not a significant relationship of either tc or no3 n to depth to the top of the open interval or water level suggesting that unsaturated overburden thickness is not an important control on the presence of surface contamination in the study area tables 1 and 2 precipitation was significantly lower for wells with tc present table 2 suggesting that rain may not be a controlling transport factor of bacteria to the well as has been reported for other settings procopio et al 2017 shuler et al 2018 however these precipitation data represent annual totals and do not integrate more complex event based dynamics such as rapid water table rise during a rainstorm into microbiologically active portions of the vadose zone presence of tc was detected in 26 and 22 of wells with modern and mixed age groundwater respectively and was absent in all wells with premodern water 4 3 stable isotopes of groundwater groundwater δ18o and δ2h ranged from 13 5 to 6 8 and 97 5 to 51 4 respectively fig 5 a groundwater d excess ranged from 3 0 to 15 4 and decreased markedly from the high elevation site mean 12 6 to 10 at lower elevations fig 4b samples with δ18o values less than 9 5 located above elevations of 700 m fall along an estimated local meteoric water line lmwl with the same slope 8 as the global meteoric water line gmwl but shifted to a d excess of 12 6 fig 4 fig 5a globally meteoric d excess values above 10 plotting above the gmwl indicate low humidity source regions or continental recycling of water vapor which would be expected for the pacific frontal systems that traverse the california coast ranges and central valley to supply moisture to the study area ingraham taylor 1991 groundwater d excess values below 10 plotting below the gmwl broadly indicate alteration of the isotopic composition of water due to evaporation especially in regions where the d excess of local precipitation exceeds the global average clark fritz 1997 approximately one quarter 26 of groundwater samples in the study area had d excess values 10 consistent with isotopic enrichment by evaporation fig 5a groundwater d excess was strongly correlated with site elevation and map fig 4a b table 1 indicating that evaporation impacted groundwaters with lower d excess values are associated with low elevation sites that receive less precipitation than high elevation portions of the study area although no groundwater sampled in this study below an elevation of 400 m had d excess 10 two 61 m deep yuba county water agency wells ycwa 09 and ycwa 10 located in the sacramento valley approximately 20 km west of the study supplementary material figure s3 were sampled in march 2006 for a prior study and had d excess values of 12 6 and 12 8 respectively california department of water resources 2008 confirming that the lwml derived from the high elevation groundwater samples is also a reasonable endmember for precipitation at low elevations within the study area fig 5a variation of meteoric δ18o and δ2h along the lwml is due to the altitude effect on equilibrium isotope fractionation causing the isotopic composition of precipitation from rising and cooling air masses to become increasingly depleted at higher elevations clark fritz 1997 the approximate δ18o elevation lapse slope for our study area based on regression of regional precipitation data is 2 8 km 1 lechler niemi 2011 we assumed the intercept of the lapse trend to be 7 5 at sea level 0 m which represents the amount weighted annual mean of precipitation δ18o in the southwestern sacramento valley where storm tracks traverse before rising over the sierra nevada range criss davisson 1996 the ycwa well data support this precipitation derived lapse intercept with groundwater δ18o values of 7 7 and 7 6 at elevations of 19 and 16 m respectively fig 5b groundwater δ18o closely tracked the estimated lapse rate trend due to inputs from meteoric sources with altitude dependent isotopic signatures fig 5b groundwater δ18o residuals horizontal offset from the lapse trend in fig 5b ranged from 1 0 to 1 2 with a central tendency of zero respective mean and median of residuals was 0 04 and 0 05 below the analytical error and 86 falling within 0 5 groundwater site elevation residuals vertical offset from the lapse rate in fig 5b ranged from 372 to 416 m with a central tendency close to zero respective mean and median of residuals was 17 m and 14 m and 89 falling within 200 m these data indicate that precipitation sourcing groundwater recharge is extremely local to respective study sites there were no statistically significant differences among d excess values for the different groundwater age classes p 0 261 however all but one of the low d excess samples were of either modern or mixed age supplementary material figure s4 water quality indicators of surface contamination were significantly related to d excess with higher no3 n concentrations and tc detection frequency associated with lower d excess values tables 1 and 2 the highest no3 n groundwaters also tested positive for tc and were located in the lower elevation portions of the study region where groundwater d excess was close to or 10 fig 6 4 4 stable isotopes of surface water and river temperatures surface water δ18o and δ2h from the main stems of the yuba and bear rivers ranged from 12 9 to 7 9 and 96 6 to 61 6 respectively with river temperatures ranging from 2 c to 26 c fig 5a supplementary material table s1 and figure s5 waters from the yuba and bear rivers had a similar central tendency both groups had identical values for median δ18o of 11 3 but the bear river had slightly more depleted and enriched values than the yuba river at up and down gradient sites respectively supplementary material figure s6 this could be due to the fact that the bear river sampling was more temporally extensive than the yuba which was not sampled through much of 2003 supplementary material figure s5 river waters that followed the gmwl plotted at the lower end of the groundwater δ18o spectrum and fell considerably below the lapse trend fig 5 this large vertical offset is due to the influence of runoff from higher elevation 1500 m portions of the study area that is derived in large part from snowmelt and ranges from 15 to 12 ingraham taylor 1991 river waters had d excess values ranging from 4 5 to 12 with 88 below 10 due to the near ubiquitous effects of evaporation on bear and yuba river water surface water samples from the camp far west reservoir cfwr and the adjacent dairy farm mine pit lake had δ18o values ranging from 10 8 to 4 5 supplementary material table s2 and define a local evaporation line for the cfwr area with a slope of 4 6 fig 5a consistent with expected evaporation line slopes for surface waters in the study region 4 5 gibson et al 2008 the cfwr evaporation line intersects the gmwl at δ18o value of 11 7 similar to the median value of the aggregate river water dataset the dairy farm mine pit lake captures overflow from the cfwr and includes the most evaporated endmembers of high elevation source waters conveyed by the bear river dry season samples from sites along the bear river located both above and below the cfwr b3 and b4 fell along the cfwr evaporation line with δ18o values ranging from approximately 10 5 to 7 9 samples from b3 were also likely impacted by evaporative processes occurring in the up gradient combie reservoir high elevation mine pit lakes are also included here to constrain the variability and extent of surface water evaporation on the isotopic composition of standing surface waters throughout the study area and plotted both above and below the cfwr evaporation line with δ18o values ranging up to approximately 3 0 supplementary material table s2 figure s6 time series of samples collected each month along the bear river for one year showed that river temperature and δ18o generally increased while d excess decreased with distance downstream due to the cumulative effects of surface warming and evaporation on surface waters moving through open channels and reservoirs fig 7 river water δ18o and d excess showed a distinct seasonal pattern respectively decreasing and increasing in response to meteoric inputs during the winter wet season through spring snowmelt at the onset of the dry season δ18o and d excess respectively increased and decreased due to evaporation throughout the summer and into the fall with a peak separation of δ18o values between upstream and downstream sites of about 3 5 in november there was a temporal lag between peak δ18o peak and peak river temperature with the latter occurring 3 4 months earlier during the middle of the dry season this is likely due to complex mixing dynamics in open channels and reservoirs long term memory effects of mixing with evaporated water stored in abundant reservoirs can also explain why regional river waters fall beneath local and global meteoric trends even following snowmelt when river δ18o and d excess values are clearly impacted by substantial influxes of meteoric runoff figs 5a 7 4 5 monte carlo mixing model analysis in order to extend the above results and heuristically evaluate recharge sources and associated mixing fractions for evaporation impacted groundwater we developed a simple 2 component base mixing model assuming low d excess groundwater samples could be explained by mixing of local precipitation and an unknown regional surface water endmember we modeled the 20 samples with d excess 10 that were most clearly impacted by evaporative processes we estimated the δ18o and δ2h of local precipitation δl at each sample site using the wellhead elevation study area lapse rate and the lmwl fig 5 table 3 next we extrapolated a mixing line connecting the δl endmember with its corresponding sampled groundwater value δgw in δ space to a point of intersection with the camp far west reservoir evaporation line defining an evaporated surface water endmember δsw for a given site at that point fig 8 a we then evaluated the fraction of surface water in the groundwater sample nsw using the following modification of the two component mixing equation given by faure 1998 δgw δl δsw δl for detailed model equations see supplementary material sm3 results from the base model show that mixing proportions from surface water sources resembling cfwr and dry season bear river water ranged from 11 to 63 with a mean of 31 across the 20 modeled samples table 4 since the above modeling approach is fundamentally limited by uncertainties in the δl and δsw endmembers we used a monte carlo simulation to explore the effects of parameter uncertainty on the base model e g arendt et al 2015 we generated 10 000 potential combinations of four model parameters by randomly sampling uniform distributions bounded by physically reasonable parameter ranges table 3 the intercept of the lapse trend equation b18z and lmwl intercept blmwl parameters determine the composition of the δl endmember and were randomly varied from the base model values by 0 3 and 1 0 respectively based on the standard deviations of the unevaporated groundwater samples from the lapse trend and lmwl fig 8b the δsw endmember depends on the evaporation line slope mlel and the δ18o value of its intersection point with the gmwl δi we allowed the mlel to vary randomly between 3 and 5 representing the potential range of evaporative slopes for soil and surface waters in study region gibson et al 2008 and the δi values from 13 0 to 10 8 covering the range of observed regional surface waters plotting along the gmwl fig 5a further discussion of model parameters and sensitivity analysis is included in supplementary material sm4 models were considered to fail when the estimated δsw endmember fell outside of the range of observed isotopic values for regional surface waters in the study area δ18o from 13 to 3 and estimated mixing fractions were discarded thirteen of the 20 modeled samples exclusively produced δsw values within the acceptable range and had model failure rates of 0 table 4 only four samples had model failure rates 10 b02 b04 b06 b09 three out of these four samples b02 b06 b09 had measured δgw values that were enriched from corresponding δl endmembers in δ space with slopes between 3 and 5 in 15 26 of sample model scenarios and could therefore be explained by evaporation of local rain for those particular parameter combinations table 4 it is worthy of note that well b09 had a water level 7 cm below the land surface at the time of sampling and could have easily be impacted near surface evaporation of local rain in ponded or waterlogged soils no other samples had isotopic compositions that could be explained by evaporation of local rain given the modeled parameter ranges of the accepted models estimated δsw values covered a broad range of potential evaporation trends in δ space encompassing the observed range of evaporated samples within the yuba and bear river watersheds fig 8b evaporated samples from cfwr and bear river sites fell within a 95 probability region calculated from the highest marginal posterior density for all accepted model δsw values which was estimated using a bivariate kernel density smoothing algorithm bolker 2019 the majority of dry season bear river and cfwr samples fell within the highest density probability region in δ space which encompassed 50 of all accepted modeled δsw values this shows that given the uncertainty in the δl endmember and the assumption that samples mixed with an evaporation impacted source water of high elevation origin the most probable δsw endmember for the ensemble dataset closely resembles evaporation trends consistent with surface waters along the bear river that have undergone extensive evaporation in open channels and reservoirs with high elevation catchments of the accepted models surface water mixing percentages ranged from 4 to 84 table 4 normal statistical moments can often be used to characterize monte carlo mixing models arendt et al 2015 and in this case though distributions of sample surface water mixing fractions were non gaussian model output distributions had strong central tendencies sample means for surface water mixing percentages were only 0 2 higher than respective medians and standard deviations were generally within 10 of the mean and only 1 5 lower than the span of respective interquartile ranges q3 q1 table 4 mixing proportions for the base model were generally higher than the monte carlo median mean values but within the interquartile range fig 9 the monte carlo mean standard deviation for surface water mixing percentages for the 20 individual samples ranged from 12 4 to 58 9 table 4 the mean standard deviation of surface water mixing percentages for all accepted mixing models across the 20 different samples was 28 13 monte carlo simulation results should be interpreted with caution modeled surface water endmembers and mixing fractions are probabilistic representations based on model assumptions and endmember parameter uncertainty however this modeling approach is useful because it demonstrates that evaporation of local precipitation is an extremely unlikely source of the low d excess groundwater signal and constrains the extent to which native groundwater could have mixed with regional surface waters of high elevation origin 4 6 noble gas recharge temperatures measured dissolved noble gas results for groundwater ne ar kr and xe and additional model inputs are included in the usgs data release of levy and faulkner 2019 groundwater ngrt ranged from 2 4 c to 21 4 c with mean errors of 0 9 c and generally decreased with elevation fig 10 table 5 model probabilities ranged from 1 to 99 with a median of 58 table 5 no models were removed due to low probability values excess air expressed as δne ranged from 2 to 369 with a median value of 43 table 5 the sample from well y09 had δne 400 and was omitted from these results although high values of δne 100 have been associated with fractured rock aquifers where rapid water table fluctuations can lead to elevated excess air concentrations the majority 85 of modeled samples had δne 100 samples with δne 100 occurred at both low and high elevation sites 245 to 1650 m and were within the range measured in other montane fractured rock aquifers e g manning caine 2007 although lapse trends for precipitation weighted maat and maat had similar slopes 4 6 c km 1 and 4 7 c km 1 respectively the former had a lower intercept 12 5 c than the latter 17 4 c because most of the precipitation in the study area occurs during the winter when temperatures are cooler than the annual average fig 10 high elevation sites preferentially tracked the lapse rate for the precipitation weighted maat we detrended the ngrt by subtracting the maat to better understand how recharge temperatures vary with respect to the maat over the elevation gradient of the study area detrended ngrt values ranged from 6 4 c below the maat at high elevation and exceeded the maat by 0 6 to 4 8 c at eight low elevation sites fig 10 table 5 the detrended ngrt had a significant correlation with elevation and the other elevation correlated variables and was most strongly correlated with d excess table 1 suggesting a linkage between the groundwater evaporation signal and warmer recharge temperatures co located at low elevations since ngrt models are sensitive to changes in recharge elevation we did a model sensitivity analysis by increasing the recharge elevation of the initial model by 400 m which is approximately the maximum elevation residual of groundwater δ18o from the stable isotope lapse rate fig 5a modeled ngrt values at 400 m from the wellhead elevation were only 1 0 c to 1 7 c cooler than the base model with slopes of relation 4 2 c km 1 to 2 7 c km 1 that were only slightly higher than maat and precipitation weighted maat lapse rates supplementary material figure s7 this suggests that even if the sampled groundwater did recharge at a substantially higher elevation which is unlikely for most samples considering how closely the data follow the stable isotope lapse trend it would not greatly change the interpretation of ngrt values with respect the atmospheric lapse rate trends modeled ngrt values close to the precipitation weighted maat are likely due to rapid recharge of precipitation equilibrated to cool ambient air temperatures during the winter wet season values of ngrt between the precipitation weighted maat and maat at low elevation sites could either be due to higher proportions of warmer season recharge or longer residence times in the vadose zone where the temperature of recharge typically approaches the mean ground temperature typically 0 3 c greater than the maat at depth as it infiltrates to the water table e g stute schlosser 2000 however these sites did not show concomitant increases of detrended ngrt with depth to the open interval or water level table 1 which would both be linked longer vadose zone transit times soil temperatures at 10 and 15 cm depths from the noaa esrl meteorological station 14 km northeast of nevada city at an elevation of 1055 m closely tracked air temperatures from 2011 to 2019 showing a slight attenuation of signal amplitude with depth supplementary material figure s8 at these shallow depths mean and precipitation weighted mean annual soil temperatures were within a degree cooler than those of the air suggesting that average air temperatures are a reasonable approximation for those of the shallow ground in the study region seasonal variations of shallow ground temperature typically attenuate with depth and approach the maat plus any additional geothermal heating anderson 2005 assuming a regional geothermal gradient of 25 c km 1 segal et al 2014 geothermal heating at the depths to groundwater levels measured in this study could result in ground temperatures exceeding the maat by 0 4 c on average and up to 2 7 c at the deepest water level however at low elevations where ngrt was highest geothermal heating could only account for 0 0 1 5 c at measured water table depths and thus could not explain the higher ngrt values the most likely explanation for ngrt values exceeding the maat at low elevations is recharge during the summer dry season when seasonal temperatures exceed the annual mean since virtually no precipitation occurs during the dry season surface water is the primary source of recharge to bedrock aquifers during these times six out of the eight samples with ngrt values higher than the maat also had d excess values 10 corroborating evidence of recharge from surface water sources the mean of all measured dry season june september river water temperatures at each of the yuba and bear river sampling sites ranged from 14 c to 24 c corresponding with the elevation and temperature ranges of the warmest ngrt values fig 10 supplementary material figure s9 5 discussion 5 1 sources and seasonality of groundwater recharge determining sources of recharge to fractured rock aquifers is critical to predict vulnerabilities of montane water supplies to climate change meixner et al 2016 groundwater from domestic wells in the yuba and bear river watersheds closely tracked δ18o and precipitation weighted maat lapse trends which suggests that rapid and local meteoric recharge is prevalent throughout the study area this finding is consistent with other studies of recharge to fractured rock aquifers abbott et al 2000 gleeson et al 2009 although mixing with premodern groundwater is apparent throughout the study area fig 1c isotopic studies of eocene gravels in the yuba river suggest that paleoclimatic lapse rates were similar to those observed in modern precipitation and would not substantially shift groundwater samples away from modern lapse trends mulch et al 2006 in a contrasting geological setting peters et al 2018 showed groundwater sampled across a broad elevation gradient on mount shasta northern california had δ18o and ngrt values that fell substantially below lapse trends and likely traveled 1000 vertical meters along deep subsurface flowpaths before reaching lower elevation discharge zones in the northern sierra nevada foothills local geology does not support the formation of elevation driven intermediate and regional flow systems sensu tóth 1963 because major faults and fractures along which groundwater travels are oriented roughly perpendicular to the regional elevation gradient recharge originating at local topographic highs throughout the study area likely discharges towards adjacent deeply incised river valleys fig 1b alternately the volcanic setting of mount shasta is more conducive to long range subsurface flow through high permeability igneous structures oriented parallel to the regional topographic slope peters et al 2018 the geologic setting of our study area also influences recharge rates as evidenced from the noble gas data other studies of high elevation montane recharge in the nearby lake tahoe area reported ngrt values much closer to the local maat singleton moran 2010 segal et al 2014 however those measurements were made in alluvial basins where slower recharge rates through unconsolidated sediments allow more time for infiltrating water to equilibrate to the ground temperature maat at depth in the vadose zone stute schlosser 2000 conversely rapid infiltration through bedrock fractures can quickly isolate recharge waters from atmospheric gases thereby preserving seasonal recharge signals e g plummer et al 2001 this is most clearly shown in our study by ngrt values which fall along the precipitation weighted lapse trends fig 10 signifying rapid seasonal recharge during the winter when the bulk of annual precipitation occurs fig 2 manning and solomon 2003 observed a similar offset of ngrt values from the maat lapse trend to one of near identical slope but lower intercept in an alpine fractured rock aquifer where recharge occurs predominantly during spring snowmelt the most striking feature of these data is the presence of low d excess groundwaters at low elevation sites which we interpret as a conservative tracer of mixing with surface waters sourced from high elevation catchments although evaporation processes such as sub cloud evaporation of rain e g salamakilis et al 2016 and soil water evaporation e g sprenger et al 2016 could affect the d excess of local rain infiltrating warmer and drier low elevation sites these processes do not typically affect the isotopic composition of groundwater recharge except in some in arid regions with deep vadose zones and are not likely to be important in the study area where the vast majority of precipitation rapidly infiltrates shallow soil columns during the cool and humid wet season evaristo et al 2015 sprenger et al 2016 additionally only a few of the low d excess groundwater samples could be explained by evaporation of local precipitation in monte carlo mixing simulations table 4 therefore the most likely source of low d excess groundwater at low elevation within the study area is mixing with evaporated surface waters from higher elevation sources there are three primary sources of surface water that could contribute to groundwater recharge in the study area local tributaries regional rivers and diversions for human use local tributaries in the study area also tend to have d excess values 10 but δ18o values closer to local precipitation because they source waters from sub catchments that are hydrologically disconnected from isotopically depleted headwaters soltero 2013 2018 additionally local tributaries are typically ephemeral at low elevations with peak flows during the wet season this is inconsistent with stable isotope and ngrt results at low elevation sites that support mixing with high elevation source waters that are isotopically fractionated by surface evaporation and recharge during the dry season it is also unlikely that direct seepage from regional rivers could cause such a spatially distributed recharge signal across the low elevation study sites because they flow through deeply incised channels that span a limited extent of the study area and cannot possibly supply recharge to intervening highlands fig 1 at low elevations however large volumes of regional river water sourced from high elevation catchments are diverted for local use through widespread networks of earthen ditches and canals only a portion of which are mapped in fig 1c where flow increases during dry times in response to human demand fig 2 although several water districts deliver surface waters to low elevation portions of the study area the nid is the largest and its service area roughly corresponds to the area of low elevation sites with low d excess groundwater elevated ngrt values and surface contamination indicators figs 1c 6 and 10 the nid diverts bear river water for human use within and to the south of the study area and we interpret isotopic signatures from sites b1 to b4 to be broadly representative of the diverted river endmember which becomes isotopically enriched due to evaporation as it travels from high to low elevation through extensive water distribution infrastructure figs 7 and 8 regional river water diverted for human use could recharge bedrock aquifers either by direct application of irrigation water to the land surface or seepage from distribution infrastructure e g unlined ditches and canals the most substantial deliveries of nid irrigation water by acreage are forage pasture 69 and family garden orchard 21 brown and caldwell 2016 historic deliveries of raw irrigation water by the nid to the deer creek service area fig 1c are approximately 52 000 acre ft yr 1 to 42 000 irrigated acres tables 4 3 and 4 5 from kleinschmidt associates 2011 equaling approximately 355 mm of irrigation water per year spread out across the lower reaches of the study area normal annual precipitation minus aet at low elevation sites ranged from approximately 1000 mm at elevations near 1000 m to 285 mm at the lowest elevation site flint flint 2014 therefore irrigation water could ostensibly comprise from 27 1000 m elevations to 56 100 m elevations of the total water available for recharge across the climate gradient of the low elevation sites this could also explain why the d excess signal is so much weaker at higher elevations within the nid service area in addition to the fact that evaporative enrichment of regional river water becomes more pronounced as it travels through distribution infrastructure from high to low elevation fig 7 although direct application of irrigation water to the land surface is clearly an important pathway for diverted river recharge it is also important to consider seepage from the distribution infrastructure while the volume of irrigation water applied directly to the land surface within the study area is quantitatively important with respect to the recharge budget as shown above much of this water is dispersed over large areas and may not overcome the soil moisture deficit to recharge underlying aquifers seepage studies on canals within the study area using both isotopic tracers and numerical modeling have shown that leakage from unlined channels can saturate the underlying vadose zone and seep vertically into fractured bedrock thereby forming a direct hydrologic connection to the underlying aquifer hydrofocus 2003 2010 further seepage rates below canals have been shown to increase during periods of high stage that occur when human demand peaks during dry times the nid typically assumes conveyance seepage losses of 15 on raw water deliveries kleinschmidt associates 2011 therefore using the above estimate for raw water deliveries distribution infrastructure seepage alone could account for 6 1000 m elevations to 28 100 m elevations of the water available for recharge across the climate gradient of the low elevation study sites and is likely even greater with proximity to ditches and canals hydrofocus 2010 used stable isotopes of water to show that wells located up to 300 m downslope from an nid canal located at elevations 1000 m contained an average of 32 canal water based on the above discussion we propose the following conceptual model for the hydrogeology of our study area during wet and dry conditions during wet times groundwater is predominantly replenished by local precipitation that rapidly recharges aquifers through bedrock fractures fig 11 a during dry times regional water tables drop and flow through water distribution infrastructure increases to meet demand in a reversal of the natural flow regime fig 2 increased application of irrigation water at the land surface and seepage from unlined ditches and canals thereby can become a much more substantial portion of the recharge budget at low elevations during drought fig 11b 5 2 vulnerability of the groundwater resource both quantity and quality of groundwater resources are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change green et al 2011 expansion of the rural residential population in the study area over the past 50 years has put increasing stress on the fractured bedrock aquifer fig 3 which is most vulnerable to drought at high elevations where recharge is derived primarily from local precipitation the prevalence of modern groundwater throughout the study area also suggests that groundwater storage is transient and deep stores of premodern fossil water are not available to buffer supplies during drought fig 1b although our results suggest low elevation groundwater supplies can be buffered by surface water subsidies during dry times fig 11b water quality vulnerabilities may become more pronounced with increasing reliance on surface water sources our results show that groundwater in our study area is susceptible to microbial and no3 n contamination at low elevations fig 4 presence of tc ec and ent in groundwater can be caused by mixing with surface water septic leachate agricultural recharge runoff and supported by biofilms growing on well casings screens or pumps jamieson et al 2002 pandey et al 2014 somaratne hallas 2015 direct connection of bacteria in groundwater wells to surface water sources has been inferred by physiographic setting and microbial taxonomy conboy goss 2000 somaratne hallas 2015 as well as observed directly using isotopic tracers shuler et al 2018 geology is an important control on the susceptibility of domestic wells to microbial contamination in a survey of domestic wells across the united states embrey and runkle 2006 found higher detection frequencies for coliform bacteria in carbonate or crystalline rock aquifers than those composed of unconsolidated sediments this is consistent with a wide body of literature showing that pathogenic bacteria are better attenuated in recharge moving through high porosity media with longer residence times compared to rapid preferential flow through fractures and macropores pandey et al 2014 prior studies of domestic wells in the sierra nevada foothills have found bacterial indicators to be of concern with detection frequencies 25 similar to our findings california state water resources control board 2005 2010 in this study higher detection frequencies for tc were associated with groundwater that received inputs from diverted surface water table 2 fig 6 coliform bacteria particularly ec occur widely in surface waters of our study area brown and caldwell 2016 starr palencia 2017 three out of the four springs sampled in this study tested positive for tc including two in the headwaters of the north yuba river suggesting tc may be a fairly broad indicator of surface water sources in the study area however the co occurrence of elevated no3 n with tc at low elevation sites supports more specific anthropogenic contamination sources including septic leachate irrigation return flows or seepage of untreated surface water from ditches and canals table 2 fig 6 5 3 implications for integrated water resources management the human component of the hydrologic cycle needs to be quantified to forecast the impacts of climate change on water resources taylor et al 2012 previous studies have examined the impacts of suburban development on runoff generation and groundwater recharge burns et al 2005 irrigation and groundwater abstraction on aquifer geochemistry jurgens et al 2009 ayotte et al 2011 and return flows related to groundwater surface water interactions fernald et al 2010 visser et al 2018 however few studies have reported the effects of climate change on paired surface and groundwater resources that are intensively managed for domestic use rather climate change impacts are typically modeled on representative natural systems to reduce uncertainties associated with the human component of the water cycle e g flint flint 2014 godsey et al 2014 or heavily irrigated agricultural systems where focused effects on the recharge budget are extremely pronounced e g toews allen 2009 condon maxwell 2014 here we illuminate the impacts of distributed surface water development and drought on groundwater resources in a rural residential setting where re plumbing of the natural hydrologic system has substantially altered sources and seasonality of groundwater recharge fig 11 return flows associated with surface water development are potentially a double edged sword and could both enhance recharge during drought and introduce water quality vulnerabilities associated with rapid infiltration of untreated surface waters additionally since recharge to fractured bedrock aquifers in the sierra nevada foothills is highly localized land use planning for source protection and recharge enhancement in this and other similar settings should be focused close to the wellhead hydrologic models and climate mitigation planning for such resources should focus on predicted changes to seasonal rainfall patterns as opposed to snowmelt volume and timing since recharge from the latter will depend more on secondary effects of reservoir and streamflow regulation in intensively managed headwater catchments given that population is expected to increase by nearly 85 in the northern sierra nevada foothills between 2000 and 2050 cosumnes american bear yuba integrated regional water management group 2014 it is of extreme importance to understand the impacts of increased human demand on paired groundwater and surface water supplies and how these resources are fundamentally connected winter et al 1998 6 conclusions we made a detailed geochemical survey of domestic wells in the sierra nevada foothills to determine sources of recharge and associated vulnerability of groundwater supply from fractured rock aquifers during historic drought stable isotopes of water and ngrt values closely tracked atmospheric lapse trends suggesting that groundwater inputs in the study region are dominated by local precipitation that recharges fractured bedrock rapidly during the winter wet season however samples from wells with water isotope signatures that were fractionated by evaporation and elevated ngrt likely contained a component of dry season recharge from diverted surface waters both irrigation return flows and seepage from extensive water distribution infrastructure throughout low elevation irrigation districts are potential sources of the surface water signal and would logically increase in the dry season and drought when human demand is high monte carlo isotope mixing models show that evaporation impacted samples are likely mixtures of local rain with an average of 28 13 from diverted river water from high elevation catchments groundwater wells impacted by mixing with diverted surface waters tended to have elevated levels of nitrate and coliform bacteria compared to those replenished exclusively by local precipitation high elevation wells reliant on precipitation for recharge are more vulnerable to supply shortage during drought whereas low elevation wells that receive recharge subsidies from diverted surface waters are more susceptible to water quality degradation the impacts of human alterations to the water cycle are important to consider for both groundwater and surface water to forecast vulnerabilities of paired

5689,characterization of the rainfall infiltration mechanism whether piston or preferential flow through an unsaturated zone is necessary for groundwater resource assessment and for analysis of environmental geological hazards however several limitations and difficulties remain in determining the infiltration mechanism in arid and semiarid areas this study combines the evaluations of soil water infiltration characteristics recharge rate and determination of groundwater age at a water table in a semiarid loess tableland to examine the recharge processes the case study is the xifeng loess tableland in the loess plateau of china which has an unsaturated zone depth of 40 75 m and an obvious 1963 3h peak at a depth of 7 5 m according to the piston flow the soil water infiltration velocity is 0 12 0 14 m yr corresponding to a recharge rate of 37 41 mm yr based on the 1963 3h peak and chloride mass balance method all of the groundwater from the water table and wells is old tritium free with ages ranging from hundreds of years to 20 000 years which suggests that no rapid modern recharge has occurred since the 1950s the chloride content of soil water in the deep unsaturated zone with an average value of 10 8 mg l in the unsaturated zone below 30 m overlaps with that in groundwater at 4 0 10 9 mg l the comprehensive isotopic and chemical compositions for soil water and groundwater showed that piston flow was dominant during soil water infiltration at the field scale resulting in the delay of modern water and related solutes entering the groundwater combined evaluations of the unsaturated zone with those of the saturated zone and the use of multiple environmental tracers such as cl br 2h 18o 13c 3h and 14c can be regarded as a generic framework for studying the recharge processes in arid and semiarid areas with thick unsaturated zones at macroscopic and field scales keywords groundwater recharge tritium loess plateau of china unsaturated zone groundwater age piston flow 1 introduction diffuse recharge refers to the widespread movement of water by infiltration and percolation through the unsaturated zone to the water table as a result of precipitation over large areas alley 2009 two infiltration pathways occur in the unsaturated zone piston or uniform flow and preferential flow piston flow leads to stable wetting fronts parallel to the soil surface whereas preferential flow results in irregular wetting bouma 1981 hendrickx and flury 2001 preferential flow in the unsaturated zone which includes macropore crack burrow finger and lateral flows has both environmental and human health implications because it favors the transport of contaminants to the groundwater often more rapidly than that by piston flow with limited interaction with the chemically and biologically reactive upper layer of the soil allaire et al 2009 jarvis et al 2016 because the infiltration rate is relatively low in arid and semiarid arid areas and the unsaturated zone is commonly thick the infiltration mechanism can greatly affect the groundwater recharge piston flow delays the response between the release of recharging water and contaminants into the groundwater whereas preferential flow enables modern recharging water to rapidly enter the aquifer and groundwater and has vulnerability to contamination flint et al 2002 debieche et al 2012 huang et al 2017 the behavior of piston flow and preferential flow co evolving with the critical zone has become one of the 23 unsolved problems in hydrology blöschl et al 2019 laboratory and field techniques used in research include observations of structures water distribution and movement gas distribution and movement breakthrough curves of solutes and particles and dye tracing flury and wai 2003 jarvis 2007 allaire et al 2009 nobles et al 2010 oberdörster et al 2010 šimůnek et al 2016 however although preferential flow may be ubiquitous it is difficult to measure and quantify sheng et al 2014 blöschl et al 2019 most studies on preferential flow have been conducted in a laboratory or at very shallow depths of the unsaturated zone mainly in the root zone commonly less than 2 m deep such depths include the upper part of the unsaturated zone that supports vegetation rooting and typically range from 0 4 m to 2 m however the depths can extend to several meters for individual plants gazis and feng 2004 schenk and jackson 2005 fan et al 2017 song et al 2009 because the flow characteristics are affected by multiple factors such as vegetation roots and soil type preferential flow can vary on a small scale depending on the local soil characteristics the present knowledge is inadequate for i quantifying preferential flow in the field and at larger scale ii evaluating spatial variety and iii determining which process controls water flow and solute transport in the field allaire et al 2009 oberdörster et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 jarvis et al 2016 models do not at present fully reflect the present state of empirical knowledge of the preferential flow of the unsaturated zone jarvis et al 2016 this is especially true in arid and semi arid areas with thick unsaturated zones and slow infiltration velocity in the field and at larger scales related to diffuse recharge in these areas commonly used methods such as artificial tracing may not suitable for the thick arid unsaturated zone scanlon et al 2006 stone and edmunds 2016 because potential recharge requires several to tens of years for the soil water to pass through the root zone loess aquifers are located mainly in semiarid areas commonly with a relatively thick unsaturated zone liu 1985 gerginov et al 2018 particularly in chinese loess tablelands with the unsaturated zone depths of 30 80 m qu 1991 although it is clear that precipitation infiltration is the only recharge source for loess aquifers in tablelands yan and wang 1983 qu 1991 huang et al 2017 the recharge mechanism remains controversial with previous research citing totally preferential flow yan and wang 1983 xue 1995 xu and chen 2010 dual flow li et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 layered flow i e preferential flow in the upper unsaturated zone up to 7 5 m and piston flow in the lower part tan et al 2017 and piston flow zhang et al 1990 huang et al 2017 heterogeneous process could not be a reason for the controversy i e different research groups with different conclusions based on different data observations because loess distribution is relatively uniform over the loess plateau at least in tablelands characterization of the rainfall infiltration mechanism through the thick unsaturated zone is necessary for groundwater resource assessment cao et al 2016 li et al 2017 gerginov et

tracer for evaluating soil water infiltration processes phillips 1994 cook et al 1994 stone and edmunds 2016 groundwater age determined using multiple tracers for example 3h cfcs 85kr 14c can provide information of recharge time and can identify whether there is a modern recharge the approach and the different tools used are not innovative but the combination of several tools is interesting it is of interest to compare results of the recharge rate obtained from one tool to another e g 3h peak methods and chloride mass balance technique to check the recharge processes the aim of this study is to combine evaluations of soil water infiltration characteristics recharge rates and in particular groundwater age at water table in a semiarid loess tableland to examine the recharge processes using

in semiarid zones and world wheat zones between n30 55 and s30 40 loess and secondary loess covered areas are also well developed regions for global industry and agriculture liu 1985 the greatest loess development occurs in china where deposits cover 4 4 105 km2 and are distributed mainly in the middle reaches of the yellow river with an area of 2 73 105 km2 this region is known as the loess plateau of china lpc fig 1 loess a type of aeolian deposit has been deposited in succession since 2 4 ma heller and liu 1982 loess originates from areas across the globe particularly in the lpc central asia eastern europe western europe and north america generally loess contains a significant proportion of silt sized particles accounting for 70 85 and is composed of quartz feldspar mica and other minerals enriched in carbonate with a typical caco3 content of 10 20 liu 1985 the caco3 in loess is a secondary deposit that occurs during loessification processes ning et al 2006 yang et al 2015 the study area in xifeng loess tableland is located in the central part of the lpc and is the largest tableland in the region with loess depth of 150 200 m qu 1991 hou and zhang 2004 the horizontal cretaceous mudstone k1 lh is covered by quaternary loess fig 2 composed of lower pleistocene q1 middle pleistocene q2 and upper pleistocene q3 deposits the q1 loess with a thickness of 40 50 m commonly crops out at the bottom of the upper and middle reaches of gullies the hard and compacted q1 loess has low permeability and is usually considered as an aquitard qu 1991 li 2015 the q2 loess with thickness of 120 170 m is unconsolidated and has relatively large porosity and is considered to be a good aquifer the q3 loess has a thickness of 10 15 m and is distributed above the q2 loess as the top soil in the area fig 2 in the xifeng loess plain the depth of the water table ranges mainly from 40 m to 75 m with an increasing trend from the center of the plain to its surrounding areas the discharge of groundwater is mainly in the form of suspension gravity springs in gullies fig 2 the average annual precipitation is 546 mm yr approximately 68 of which falls between june and september during the asian monsoon the average annual temperature is 9 2 c according to data reported from 1956 to 2010 the main crops are winter wheat and maize which one crop each per year 2 2 sampling and analyses soil samples were collected from two deep profiles in the xifeng loess tableland in june 2018 including xz1 with a depth of 55 m reaching the water table of 54 m and penetrating the aquifer within 1 m and xz2 with a depth of 45 m fig 1 the soil samples were obtained by using an engineering geological survey drill there are no fluids added during drilling bulk samples of 2000 g were collected at intervals of 0 25 m at 0 20 m and 0 50 m below 20 m the samples were immediately sealed in polyethylene bags after collection the magnetic susceptibility ms of air dried soil 10 g

geophysics chinese academy of sciences igg cas the gravimetric soil water content θg was determined by drying a minimum of 80 g of soil at 105 c for 24 h the volumetric water content θv was calculated using the equation θv θg ds ρ w where ds is the soil dry bulk density equal to 1 5 g cm3 for loess l and 1 6 g cm3 for paleosol s in the study area qu 1991 and ρ w is the water density at 1 g cm3 to determine the cl concentrations of soil pore water 50 ml of double deionized water was added to each 50 g oven dried sediment sample the samples were agitated intermittently for 8 h and the supernatant solution was filtered through 0 45 μm filters the solutes were then analyzed by ion chromatography the cl concentrations of the soil pore water were then calculated by dividing the measured concentrations of supernatant solution by the gravimetric moisture content and multiplying the result by the mass ratio of the solution to the oven dried sediment which was 1 1 in this study

results of the analyses of the water chemistry and isotopic compositions of the soil profiles are shown in table s2 and groundwater are shown in table 1 and table 2 respectively the isotopic compositions for soil loess and carbonate concretion are given in table 3 2 3 methods water that percolates into the unsaturated zone below the root zone is referred to as potential recharge or deep drainage because it is unlikely to be removed upward to the surface this term is distinguished from actual recharge for brevity potential recharge is labeled simply as recharge in this study the approximate tritium input sequence of precipitation in the study area is based on the tritium sequence for xi an from 1953 to 2001 reconstructed by tian et al 2007 the data from 2002 to 2018 is conservatively assumed to be 12 tu the decayed tritium content in precipitation in 2018 which represents the tritium concentration in groundwater that infiltrated between 1953 and 2018 ranges from 3 1 tu to 93 4 tu except for the value of 1 1 tu in 1955 precipitation therefore groundwater with tritium content less than 3 tu can be regarded as pre modern water in this study the tritium contents in groundwater were used to distinguish pre modern water before the 1950s from modern water occurring since the 1950s assuming piston flow the vertical distribution of tracers was used to estimate the infiltration velocity and the recharge rate the other robust method used for estimating recharge rates in arid and semiarid areas is the chloride mass balance cmb between precipitation and soil water allison and hughes 1978 edmunds and walton 1980 the feasibility of the use of the cmb for estimating the recharge rate in the lpc has been demonstrated in detail by gates et al 2011 and huang et al 2013 in this study the piston flow is firstly assumed and the recharge rate based on the cmb is calculated and then the assumption will be discussed in section 4 for tritium free groundwater 14c was used to estimate the groundwater age if the δ13c and 14c content of initial or recharging water are defined which should be pre modern water without 3h but water that was most recently recharged verhagen et al 1974 mook 2000 chen et al 2003 δ13c can be used to correct further process that may add carbon to remove carbon from or exchange carbon with the dissolved inorganic carbon dic pool thereby altering the 14c concentration we call this method the v p model 3 results 3 1 grain size distribution and water content loess can be classified into loess l and paleosol s the paleosol always has a higher ms and a finer particle size than the loess fig 3 the clay 2 µm silt 2 50 µm and sand 50 2000 µm account for averages of 7 3 79 1 and 13 6 for loess with median particle sizes of 19 9 µm and 9 3 80 4 and 10 3 for paleosol with median particle sizes of 15 7 µm in soil profile xz1 respectively according to the united states department of agriculture usda soil taxonomy loess including paleosol can also be classified as silt and silt loam at the top of the paleosol the soil water content commonly reaches a relatively large value and then decreases until reaching the next paleosol fig 3 the average gravimetric water content for xz1 and xz2 was 19 7 and 19 9 and the volumetric water content was 30 2 and 30 6 respectively 3 2 measured tritium profile because the tritium measurement for soil water was conducted in a laboratory in june 2019 the tritium results were corrected to june 2018 i e sampling time the two measured tritium contents in precipitation in xifeng were 15 8 tu and 15 4 tu in 2018 with an average of 15 6 tu the tritium content was 13 2 tu between 0 75 m and 1 00 m and reached a peak of 55 2 tu at a depth of 7 5 m fig 4 below 9 75 m the tritium content was less than the detection limit of 10 tu for direct measurement the decayed tritium content in precipitation in 2018 which represents the tritium concentration in soil water and groundwater that infiltrated between 1953 and 2018 ranges from 3 1 tu to 93 4 tu the high decayed values of 30 tu occur between 1962 and 1963 the peak of 93 4 tu in 1963 compared with precipitation tritium input history and the decay value to 2018 the maximum value of 55 2 tu at 7 5 m is the 1963 tritium peak 3 3 measured chloride profile the cl content of the soil pore water at a shallow depth of 4 5 m was high at 12 6 113 8 mg l for xz1 and 26 1 176 2 mg l for xz2 fig 4 below the depth of 4 5 m the cl content generally showed limited variation at 7 4 33 1 mg l with an average of 17 2 mg l for xz1 and 4 4 36 1 mg l with an average of 14 6 mg l for xz2 the cl content for the deep part of the unsaturated zone 30 m ranging from 4 4 to 22 9 mg l with an average of 10 8 mg l was close to the groundwater cl content at 4 0 10 9 mg l with an average of 5 5 mg l table 1 3 4 recharge estimation in 2018 55 years since 1963 a tritium peak of 7 5 m remained in the loess profile this peak in the layered homogeneous loess profile suggests homogeneous flow for soil water the soil water infiltration velocity is expected to be 0 14 m yr 7 5 m 55 yr the average volumetric water content above 7 5 m is 28 2 correspondingly the recharge rate based on tritium peak methods is 39 mm yr 0 14 1000 28 2 mm yr table 4 this infiltration velocity and recharge rate represents the average value since 1963 according to the systematical observation of precipitation cl deposition in a rural monitoring station in the vicinity of xi an china eanet 2018 the volume weighted average cl concentration in rainfall cp from 2000 to 2015 was 1 1 mg l the annual cl input from the atmosphere is expected to be 601 mg m2 yr 546 mm yr 1 1 mg l this value may involve up to 30 of uncertainty i e 421 781 mg m2 yr owing to possible dry deposition and the historic variation in atmospheric cl deposition edmunds et al 1988 gates et al 2011 huang and pang 2011 in addition the weighted average cl content in guyuan about 120 km from the study area fig 1 was 0 8 mg l from june 2018 to may 2019 within the scope of uncertainty because the cl in the upper unsaturated zone may have been affected by human activities soil water cl below 8 m i e that recharged before 1960 based on an infiltration velocity of 0 14 m yr was used for recharge estimation based on the cmb method the weighted average cl below 8 m for xz1 and xz2 was 16 1 mg l and 14 6 mg l and the recharge rate was estimated to be 37 11 mm yr and 41 12 mm yr respectively table 4 the infiltration velocity based on these recharge rates can be calculated the average volumetric water content below 8 m was 30 6 and 31 6 for xz1 and xz2 and the infiltration velocity was 0 12 0 04 m yr and 0 13 0 04 m yr respectively the recharge rates of 37 41 mm yr based on the tritium peak method and the cmb method accounting for 6 8 7 5 of annual precipitation when the area of the xifeng loess tableland is 812 km2 li 2015 the total recharge is estimated to be 3 0 3 2 107 m3 yr based on the results of this study 3 5 groundwater chemistry the groundwater chemical compositions table 1 show a narrow variation the tds was 270 316 mg l except for xf17 which showed 225 mg l and the average tds value of all groundwater was 288 mg l the dominant anion was hco3 at 88 in meq l and the cations varied from ca mg to na the groundwater cl contents ranged from 4 0 mg l to 10 9 mg l with an average of 5 5 mg l and the br cl mass ratio was 0 0034 0 0061 excluding xf13 which showed 0 0026 with an average of 0 0045 mg l these values are equal to or exceed the marine ratio of 0 0034 which suggests that the cl in the groundwater likely originated from marine water or marine derived airborne water i e from atmospheric deposition mazor 2004 edmunds et al 2006 3 6 stable isotopes from precipitation to soil water and groundwater according to the event based precipitation analysis for water stable isotopes from june 2018 to june 2019 the stable isotopic compositions show wide variation with δ18o ranging from 13 3 to 0 7 and δ2h ranging from 95 8 to 6 5 fig 5 all of the precipitation samples were obtained near the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 fig 5 the isotopic composition for the weighted average monthly precipitation showed that during the prevailing monsoon in july and august which are the warmest seasons in the year the δ18o values generally decreased this is consistent with the six year monthly precipitation observation for gnip station xi an near the lpc iaea wmo 2019 and the one year event based precipitation observation in guyuan unpublished data the locations of which are shown in fig 1 in the middle and high latitude areas stable isotopes are normally depleted in winter and enriched in summer clark and fritz 1997 however in the lpc the summer rainfall is controlled by the east asian monsoon wei and lin 1994 araguás araguás et al 1998 kong et al 2019 which results in stable isotope depletion from july to august the stable isotopic compositions for soil water and groundwater showed relatively narrow variation compared with precipitation fig 6 the δ18o for the soil water ranges mainly from 11 to 9 with a water content weighted average of 10 6 the δ18o for the groundwater ranged from 10 5 to 9 7 with an average of 10 2 however the annual weighted average δ18o for precipitation is 8 5 the δ18o values between soil water and groundwater are very close however the soil water showed relatively greater depletion in δ2h fig 5 the stable isotopic composition for the free groundwater at the water table 54 55 m xz1 was 10 0 for δ18o and 72 8 for δ2h xf25 and 10 0 for δ18o and 73 2 for δ2h for the duplicate sample xf26 however the stable isotopic composition for the soil water from the same borehole was 9 9 for δ18o and 76 9 for δ2h 54 54 5 m and 10 9 for δ18o and 79 6 for δ2h 54 5 55 m fig 5 this could have been caused by the uncertainty in soil water δ2h and δ18o analysis which can result in wide isotopic variance depending on the extraction method orlowski et al 2019 3 7 groundwater age the soil water infiltration velocity is estimated to be 0 12 0 14 m yr based on tritium peak and cmb methods table 4 when considering all of the uncertainties discussed in section 3 4 the velocity would be 0 08 0 17 m yr soil water recharged after 1950 reached depths of only 10 m and no tritium was detected below that depth fig 4 the thickness of the unsaturated zone in xifeng ranges from 40 m to 75 m qu 1991 therefore a period of 230 940 years is required for the annual precipitation to reach the water table if the soil water flow is dominantly piston like the results show that all of the groundwater is tritium free table 2 suggesting that it was recharged prior to 1950 here 14c is used to further evaluate the groundwater age the groundwater at the water table in sample xf25 had a 14c value of 43 8 pmc and a δ13c value of 8 7 tritium was not detected because the initial recharging water should be pre modern without 3h it should have been recharged most recently the groundwater at the water table could meet this condition considering that the uncertainty of groundwater 14c age is typically 1000 2000 years buckau et al 2000 geyh 2000 hart et al 2010 the initial recharging water used for correcting groundwater 14c age has a 14c value of 45 pmc and δ13c of 8 7 the saturation indices of calcite si cal of xf25 calculated by using phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 1999 was larger than 0 suggesting that the calcite has been oversaturated in addition si cal for all other groundwaters are all larger than 0 table 1 indicating that the calcite levels were oversaturated in loess the δ13c of carbonate ranges from 8 3 to 3 3 with average of 5 8 table 3 consistent with the value 8 5 to 3 6 from previous study in the xifeng ning et al 2006 if additional carbon dissolution occurred or an exchange with carbonate for groundwater in the aquifer the δ13c would have increased pearson 1965 however there no decreasing trend was shown for δ13c when the 14c decreased fig 7 which suggests that 14c decay is responsible for the decrease in the groundwater 14c content in xifeng this means that 45 pmc can be directly used as the initial value for correcting the groundwater 14c age a0 45 pmc the results in table 2 show the corrected 14c age ranges from 220 years in groundwater sample xf25 at the water table to 19 220 years b p the general trend is such that the corrected 14c age increases with an increase in well depth table 1 and table 2 this study shows that the shallow groundwater in the loess aquifer of the tableland is composed of pre modern water and old water up to tens of thousands of years in age 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with other studies generally speaking in homogeneous soil such as that containing sand loam and silt the soil water moves downward mainly by piston flow zimmermann et al 1967 dafny and šimůnek 2016 stone and edmunds 2016 min et al 2017 lichner et al 2018 this is further confirmed by the labeled 2h and 3h pulses zimmermann et al 1967 foster and smith carington 1980 koeniger et al 2016 and 1963 3h smith et al 1970 anderson and sevel 1974 zhang et al 1990 baran et al 2007 in loamy including loess and sandy soils demonstrating piston displacement of the tracer peak therefore this theory has gained acceptance by hydrogeologists downing et al 1979 darling and bath 1988 phillips 1994 edmunds and tyler 2002 liu et al 2009 min et al 2018 a tritium peak of 235 tu has been reported in chinese loess at a depth of 10 5 m in 1998 lin and wei 2006 in addition a tritium peak of 64 tu in french loess at depth of 9 3 m was reported in 2002 baran et al 2007 that of 46 66 tu was reported in chinese loess depths of 6 5 11 0 m in 2015 zhang et al 2017 li et al 2018 2019 and that of 55 2 tu was found in chinese loess at a depth of 7 5 m in 2018 this study in addition 3h peak displacement the breakthrough curves obtained for cl and no3 and tritiated water from six undisturbed columns of loess demonstrate that homogeneous infiltration is an intrinsic characteristic of loess el etreiby and laudelout 1988 in soil water numerical simulation research piston flow is always assumed as the dominant water flow in layered loessial deposits dafny and šimůnek 2016 turkeltaub et al 2018 the recharge rates of 37 41 mm yr based on the tritium peak method and the cmb method accounting for 6 8 7 5 of annual precipitation are very similar to the values of 38 mm yr and 6 7 recorded in 1974 1980 based on the water mass balance method qu 1991 the recharge rates based on the tritium peak method 39 mm yr and the cmb methods 37 41 mm yr are very similar which is very common in arid and semiarid recharge estimation edmunds et al 1988 allison et al 1994 scanlon et al 2006 4 2 evidences for conceptual model 4 2 1 water ages if the soil water infiltrates mainly by the piston flow mode the low infiltration velocity of 0 12 0 14 m yr and thick unsaturated zone of 40 75 m would result in a long infiltration time table 1 no tritium was detected in groundwater from the water table xf25 or from wells with depths of 60 180 m table 2 4 2 2 cl distributions the high value of cl in the upper unsaturated zone was affected by recent human activities such as the use of fertilizers before the 1960s however the use of fertilizers was very limited in china averaging less than 2 4 kg hm2 zhang et al 1996 correspondingly the cl at the deep part of the unsaturated zone was relatively low the average cl content in the deep part 30 m of the two soil profiles was 10 8 mg l which overlaps the groundwater cl content of 4 0 10 9 mg l fig 4 this also suggests a piston like flow mode butler and verhagen 2001 one cannot expect total equality of the cl content between deep soil water and groundwater which indicates that the groundwater receives piston like diffuse recharge from only soil water infiltration the soil water cl content was 8 1 mg l from 54 m to 54 5 m and 9 1 mg l from 54 5 m to 55 m according to the dilution extraction method discussed in section 2 2 however the free groundwater cl content at the same depth range 54 55 m was 5 9 mg l xf25 and 5 5 mg l for duplicate sample xf26 table 1 which should be theoretically equal this is also true for the other loess tablelands chen et al 2012 li et al 2017 such as the zhengning loess tableland fig 1 where the groundwater cl content is 4 2 8 6 mg l and the average soil water cl content is 10 6 mg l 6 46 5 m and 13 6 mg l 6 62 m for two deep soil profiles huang et al 2017 gee et al 2005 found that the cl concentration in the free drain waters are obviously lower than cl concentration in soil water using dilution method as the commonly used methods to measure cl concentration in soil water and suggested that for low cl concentration in soil water the dilution method is not robust besides because the asian monsoon caused a fluctuation change during the last 20 000 years yang et al 2015 the atmospheric cl deposition may have also changed even in recent years the annual cl input has shown a large variation of 156 1521 mg m2 yr from 2000 to 2015 eanet 2018 when using cmb we assume that cl in soil originates from atmospheric deposition and atmospheric deposition of cl is stable in history time actually there is at least 10 of the variation for atmospheric deposition as the main uncertainty for the use of cmb method to estimate groundwater recharge rate edmunds et al 1988 the fluctuation of cl concentrations in soil profile below the root zone is generally interpreted as the valuation of climate with low cl concentration suggesting wet period and high cl concentration suggesting dry period cook et al 1992 edmunds and tyler 2002 stone and edmunds 2016 4 2 3 stable isotopes although the annual weighted average δ18o for precipitation was 8 5 the soil water and groundwater with more depleted δ18o values fig 5 were obviously recharged by seasonal large rainfall i e summer monsoon precipitation depletion of heavy isotopes in groundwater relative to the mean precipitation has frequently been observed in many arid and semiarid areas jasechko 2019 such as southern africa vogel and urk 1975 the southern great basin usa tyler et al 1996 the kherlen river basin eastern mongolia tsujimura et al 2007 and the north china plain von rohden et al 2010 and guyuan china huang et al 2013 the precipitation amount from july to september accounts for 55 of the annual precipitation in xifeng such depletion has been attributed to selective infiltration of rainfall from intense large volume isotopically light rainfall events although the average temperature during the late pleistocene was lower than that during the holocene the δ18o values were similar for groundwater recharged during these two epochs table 2 the slightly different isotopic compositions of δ2h between soil water and groundwater should be interpreted as a result from extracting method rather than evaporation process or other recharge mechanism comparing water stable isotopic composition between soil water and groundwater is not a very robust way to conclude that groundwater is not recharged by soil water by piston flow the similarity of stable isotopes throughout the profile also suggests a threshold of precipitation is needed to drive percolation past the rooting zone partly confirming that preferential flow is not obvious 4 2 4 water table dynamics the soil water content at a depth of 1 5 m at a loess monitoring site with a water table depth of 14 m in bulgaria where loess and loess like sediments cover approximately 11 of the bulgarian territory mostly in northern part of the country showed a relatively constant range during an 18 month observation gerginov et al 2018 at depths below 4 m the soil water content showed very limited variation qu 1991 qiu 1992 chen et al 2008 under the piston flow model with a thick unsaturated zone the recharge signal is smooth the groundwater water monitoring data recorded in the luochuan tableland with conditions similar to those in the study area showed that changes in the water table during the 1960s 1970s were narrow and were close to natural conditions with little pumpage qu 1991 evidently the groundwater was recharged by diffuse infiltration in the piston flow mode through the thick loess unsaturated zone however the water table in xifeng has decreased 5 14 m in general up to a maximum of 28 m during the recent 30 years owing to large extraction since the 1980s li 2015 4 2 5 conceptual model the recharge mechanism is always complicated for any aquifer flint et al 2002 and the preferential flow of soil water exists widely in the upper part of the unsaturated zone especially in the root zone gazis and feng 2004 stumpp and maloszewski 2010 this study combined evaluations of soil water infiltration velocity recharge rate and determination of groundwater age at a water table in a loess tableland the integrated isotopic and chemical observation from precipitation soil water and groundwater especially from the water table revealed comprehensive recharge processes a conceptual recharge model is given in fig 4 the results showed that soil water recharged from precipitation during the past decades remained in the upper 10 m and that the time required for annual precipitation to reach the water table is hundreds of years no 3h was detected in the groundwater samples and the corrected 14c ages ranged from 220 years for groundwater at the water table with a depth of 54 m to 19 220 years accordingly the cl content remained low at 4 0 10 9 mg l and the nitrate remained at the baseline level from nitrification of soil n therefore the soil water in this layered homogeneous loess of silt and silt loam infiltrated mainly via piston like flow mode on a macroscopic scale below the root zone therefore the 3h and soil cmb methods which are based on piston flow can be used in loess aquifers to assess diffuse recharge rate the combined evaluations of the unsaturated zone with those of the saturated zone and the use of multiple environmental tracers can be considered as a generic framework for evaluating recharge processes in arid and semiarid areas with thick unsaturated zones at macroscopic and field scales 5 conclusions combined evaluations of the unsaturated zone with those of the saturated zone and the use of multiple environmental tracers such as cl no3 br 2h 18o 13c 3h and 14c provides a generic framework for evaluating recharge processes especially piston and preferential flow in arid and semiarid areas with thick unsaturated zones at macroscopic and field scales the 1963 thermonuclear 3h peak still exists in the loess unsaturated zone as one of the most robust markers for tracing soil water infiltration processes especially in arid and semiarid areas where the infiltration velocity is slow the results from this study showed that in the xifeng loess tableland the time required for annual precipitation to reach the water table ranged from decades to hundreds of years therefore the groundwater age ranges from hundreds of years to 20 000 years tritium free no modern preferential recharge of the groundwater has occurred since the 1950s however the groundwater receives a continuous diffuse recharge of 3 0 3 2 107 m3 yr through the thick unsaturated zone because the characteristics of loess over the world are similar the homogeneous infiltration piston flow may be an intrinsic characteristic of loess

5689,characterization of the rainfall infiltration mechanism whether piston or preferential flow through an unsaturated zone is necessary for groundwater resource assessment and for analysis of environmental geological hazards however several limitations and difficulties remain in determining the infiltration mechanism in arid and semiarid areas this study combines the evaluations of soil water infiltration characteristics recharge rate and determination of groundwater age at a water table in a semiarid loess tableland to examine the recharge processes the case study is the xifeng loess tableland in the loess plateau of china which has an unsaturated zone depth of 40 75 m and an obvious 1963 3h peak at a depth of 7 5 m according to the piston flow the soil water infiltration velocity is 0 12 0 14 m yr corresponding to a recharge rate of 37 41 mm yr based on the 1963 3h peak and chloride mass balance method all of the groundwater from the water table and wells is old tritium free with ages ranging from hundreds of years to 20 000 years which suggests that no rapid modern recharge has occurred since the 1950s the chloride content of soil water in the deep unsaturated zone with an average value of 10 8 mg l in the unsaturated zone below 30 m overlaps with that in groundwater at 4 0 10 9 mg l the comprehensive isotopic and chemical compositions for soil water and groundwater showed that piston flow was dominant during soil water infiltration at the field scale resulting in the delay of modern water and related solutes entering the groundwater combined evaluations of the unsaturated zone with those of the saturated zone and the use of multiple environmental tracers such as cl br 2h 18o 13c 3h and 14c can be regarded as a generic framework for studying the recharge processes in arid and semiarid areas with thick unsaturated zones at macroscopic and field scales keywords groundwater recharge tritium loess plateau of china unsaturated zone groundwater age piston flow 1 introduction diffuse recharge refers to the widespread movement of water by infiltration and percolation through the unsaturated zone to the water table as a result of precipitation over large areas alley 2009 two infiltration pathways occur in the unsaturated zone piston or uniform flow and preferential flow piston flow leads to stable wetting fronts parallel to the soil surface whereas preferential flow results in irregular wetting bouma 1981 hendrickx and flury 2001 preferential flow in the unsaturated zone which includes macropore crack burrow finger and lateral flows has both environmental and human health implications because it favors the transport of contaminants to the groundwater often more rapidly than that by piston flow with limited interaction with the chemically and biologically reactive upper layer of the soil allaire et al 2009 jarvis et al 2016 because the infiltration rate is relatively low in arid and semiarid arid areas and the unsaturated zone is commonly thick the infiltration mechanism can greatly affect the groundwater recharge piston flow delays the response between the release of recharging water and contaminants into the groundwater whereas preferential flow enables modern recharging water to rapidly enter the aquifer and groundwater and has vulnerability to contamination flint et al 2002 debieche et al 2012 huang et al 2017 the behavior of piston flow and preferential flow co evolving with the critical zone has become one of the 23 unsolved problems in hydrology blöschl et al 2019 laboratory and field techniques used in research include observations of structures water distribution and movement gas distribution and movement breakthrough curves of solutes and particles and dye tracing flury and wai 2003 jarvis 2007 allaire et al 2009 nobles et al 2010 oberdörster et al 2010 šimůnek et al 2016 however although preferential flow may be ubiquitous it is difficult to measure and quantify sheng et al 2014 blöschl et al 2019 most studies on preferential flow have been conducted in a laboratory or at very shallow depths of the unsaturated zone mainly in the root zone commonly less than 2 m deep such depths include the upper part of the unsaturated zone that supports vegetation rooting and typically range from 0 4 m to 2 m however the depths can extend to several meters for individual plants gazis and feng 2004 schenk and jackson 2005 fan et al 2017 song et al 2009 because the flow characteristics are affected by multiple factors such as vegetation roots and soil type preferential flow can vary on a small scale depending on the local soil characteristics the present knowledge is inadequate for i quantifying preferential flow in the field and at larger scale ii evaluating spatial variety and iii determining which process controls water flow and solute transport in the field allaire et al 2009 oberdörster et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 jarvis et al 2016 models do not at present fully reflect the present state of empirical knowledge of the preferential flow of the unsaturated zone jarvis et al 2016 this is especially true in arid and semi arid areas with thick unsaturated zones and slow infiltration velocity in the field and at larger scales related to diffuse recharge in these areas commonly used methods such as artificial tracing may not suitable for the thick arid unsaturated zone scanlon et al 2006 stone and edmunds 2016 because potential recharge requires several to tens of years for the soil water to pass through the root zone loess aquifers are located mainly in semiarid areas commonly with a relatively thick unsaturated zone liu 1985 gerginov et al 2018 particularly in chinese loess tablelands with the unsaturated zone depths of 30 80 m qu 1991 although it is clear that precipitation infiltration is the only recharge source for loess aquifers in tablelands yan and wang 1983 qu 1991 huang et al 2017 the recharge mechanism remains controversial with previous research citing totally preferential flow yan and wang 1983 xue 1995 xu and chen 2010 dual flow li et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 layered flow i e preferential flow in the upper unsaturated zone up to 7 5 m and piston flow in the lower part tan et al 2017 and piston flow zhang et al 1990 huang et al 2017 heterogeneous process could not be a reason for the controversy i e different research groups with different conclusions based on different data observations because loess distribution is relatively uniform over the loess plateau at least in tablelands characterization of the rainfall infiltration mechanism through the thick unsaturated zone is necessary for groundwater resource assessment cao et al 2016 li et al 2017 gerginov et al 2018 and for analysis of loess landslide hazards debieche et al 2012 hou et al 2018 and groundwater pollution jia et al 2018 in arid and semiarid land the thermonuclear 3h peak is an excellent tracer for evaluating soil water infiltration processes phillips 1994 cook et al 1994 stone and edmunds 2016 groundwater age determined using multiple tracers for example 3h cfcs 85kr 14c can provide information of recharge time and can identify whether there is a modern recharge the approach and the different tools used are not innovative but the combination of several tools is interesting it is of interest to compare results of the recharge rate obtained from one tool to another e g 3h peak methods and chloride mass balance technique to check the recharge processes the aim of this study is to combine evaluations of soil water infiltration characteristics recharge rates and in particular groundwater age at water table in a semiarid loess tableland to examine the recharge processes using multiple tracers including geochemical e g cl and isotopic tracers 2h h2o 3h 13c dic 14c dic and 18o h2o this study also aims to provide a generic framework for evaluating recharge processes in arid and semiarid areas with thick unsaturated zones at macroscopic and field scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description loess covers about 10 of the earth s land surface and is distributed mainly in semiarid zones and world wheat zones between n30 55 and s30 40 loess and secondary loess covered areas are also well developed regions for global industry and agriculture liu 1985 the greatest loess development occurs in china where deposits cover 4 4 105 km2 and are distributed mainly in the middle reaches of the yellow river with an area of 2 73 105 km2 this region is known as the loess plateau of china lpc fig 1 loess a type of aeolian deposit has been deposited in succession since 2 4 ma heller and liu 1982 loess originates from areas across the globe particularly in the lpc central asia eastern europe western europe and north america generally loess contains a significant proportion of silt sized particles accounting for 70 85 and is composed of quartz feldspar mica and other minerals enriched in carbonate with a typical caco3 content of 10 20 liu 1985 the caco3 in loess is a secondary deposit that occurs during loessification processes ning et al 2006 yang et al 2015 the study area in xifeng loess tableland is located in the central part of the lpc and is the largest tableland in the region with loess depth of 150 200 m qu 1991 hou and zhang 2004 the horizontal cretaceous mudstone k1 lh is covered by quaternary loess fig 2 composed of lower pleistocene q1 middle pleistocene q2 and upper pleistocene q3 deposits the q1 loess with a thickness of 40 50 m commonly crops out at the bottom of the upper and middle reaches of gullies the hard and compacted q1 loess has low permeability and is usually considered as an aquitard qu 1991 li 2015 the q2 loess with thickness of 120 170 m is unconsolidated and has relatively large porosity and is considered to be a good aquifer the q3 loess has a thickness of 10 15 m and is distributed above the q2 loess as the top soil in the area fig 2 in the xifeng loess plain the depth of the water table ranges mainly from 40 m to 75 m with an increasing trend from the center of the plain to its surrounding areas the discharge of groundwater is mainly in the form of suspension gravity springs in gullies fig 2 the average annual precipitation is 546 mm yr approximately 68 of which falls between june and september during the asian monsoon the average annual temperature is 9 2 c according to data reported from 1956 to 2010 the main crops are winter wheat and maize which one crop each per year 2 2 sampling and analyses soil samples were collected from two deep profiles in the xifeng loess tableland in june 2018 including xz1 with a depth of 55 m reaching the water table of 54 m and penetrating the aquifer within 1 m and xz2 with a depth of 45 m fig 1 the soil samples were obtained by using an engineering geological survey drill there are no fluids added during drilling bulk samples of 2000 g were collected at intervals of 0 25 m at 0 20 m and 0 50 m below 20 m the samples were immediately sealed in polyethylene bags after collection the magnetic susceptibility ms of air dried soil 10 g was measured on a bartington ms2 system to distinguish the loess l from paleosol s and the particle size was measured on a shimadzu sald 3001 laser particle analyzer at the institute of geology and geophysics chinese academy of sciences igg cas the gravimetric soil water content θg was determined by drying a minimum of 80 g of soil at 105 c for 24 h the volumetric water content θv was calculated using the equation θv θg ds ρ w where ds is the soil dry bulk density equal to 1 5 g cm3 for loess l and 1 6 g cm3 for paleosol s in the study area qu 1991 and ρ w is the water density at 1 g cm3 to determine the cl concentrations of soil pore water 50 ml of double deionized water was added to each 50 g oven dried sediment sample the samples were agitated intermittently for 8 h and the supernatant solution was filtered through 0 45 μm filters the solutes were then analyzed by ion chromatography the cl concentrations of the soil pore water were then calculated by dividing the measured concentrations of supernatant solution by the gravimetric moisture content and multiplying the result by the mass ratio of the solution to the oven dried sediment which was 1 1 in this study

results of the analyses of the water chemistry and isotopic compositions of the soil profiles are shown in table s2 and groundwater are shown in table 1 and table 2 respectively the isotopic compositions for soil loess and carbonate concretion are given in table 3 2 3 methods water that percolates into the unsaturated zone below the root zone is referred to as potential recharge or deep drainage because it is unlikely to be removed upward to the surface this term is distinguished from actual recharge for brevity potential recharge is labeled simply as recharge in this study the approximate tritium input sequence of precipitation in the study area is based on the tritium sequence for xi an from 1953 to 2001 reconstructed by tian et al 2007 the data from 2002 to 2018 is conservatively assumed to be 12 tu the decayed tritium content in precipitation in 2018 which represents the tritium concentration in groundwater that infiltrated between 1953 and 2018 ranges from 3 1 tu to 93 4 tu except for the value of 1 1 tu in 1955 precipitation therefore groundwater with tritium content less than 3 tu can be regarded as pre modern water in this study the tritium contents in groundwater were used to distinguish pre modern water before the 1950s from modern water occurring since the 1950s assuming piston flow the vertical distribution of tracers was used to estimate the infiltration velocity and the recharge rate the other robust method used for estimating recharge rates in arid and semiarid areas is the chloride mass balance cmb between precipitation and soil water allison and hughes 1978 edmunds and walton 1980 the feasibility of the use of the cmb for estimating the recharge rate in the lpc has been demonstrated in detail by gates et al 2011 and huang et al 2013 in this study the piston flow is firstly assumed and the recharge rate based on the cmb is calculated and then the assumption will be discussed in section 4 for tritium free groundwater 14c was used to estimate the groundwater age if the δ13c and 14c content of initial or recharging water are defined which should be pre modern water without 3h but water that was most recently recharged verhagen et al 1974 mook 2000 chen et al 2003 δ13c can be used to correct further process that may add carbon to remove carbon from or exchange carbon with the dissolved inorganic carbon dic pool thereby altering the 14c concentration we call this method the v p model 3 results 3 1 grain size distribution and water content loess can be classified into loess l and paleosol s the paleosol always has a higher ms and a finer particle size than the loess fig 3 the clay 2 µm silt 2 50 µm and sand 50 2000 µm account for averages of 7 3 79 1 and 13 6 for loess with median particle sizes of 19 9 µm and 9 3 80 4 and 10 3 for paleosol with median particle sizes of 15 7 µm in soil profile xz1 respectively according to the united states department of agriculture usda soil taxonomy loess including paleosol can also be classified as silt and silt loam at the top of the paleosol the soil water content commonly reaches a relatively large value and then decreases until reaching the next paleosol fig 3 the average gravimetric water content for xz1 and xz2 was 19 7 and 19 9 and the volumetric water content was 30 2 and 30 6 respectively 3 2 measured tritium profile because the tritium measurement for soil water was conducted in a laboratory in june 2019 the tritium results were corrected to june 2018 i e sampling time the two measured tritium contents in precipitation in xifeng were 15 8 tu and 15 4 tu in 2018 with an average of 15 6 tu the tritium content was 13 2 tu between 0 75 m and 1 00 m and reached a peak of 55 2 tu at a depth of 7 5 m fig 4 below 9 75 m the tritium content was less than the detection limit of 10 tu for direct measurement the decayed tritium content in precipitation in 2018 which represents the tritium concentration in soil water and groundwater that infiltrated between 1953 and 2018 ranges from 3 1 tu to 93 4 tu the high decayed values of 30 tu occur between 1962 and 1963 the peak of 93 4 tu in 1963 compared with precipitation tritium input history and the decay value to 2018 the maximum value of 55 2 tu at 7 5 m is the 1963 tritium peak 3 3 measured chloride profile the cl content of the soil pore water at a shallow depth of 4 5 m was high at 12 6 113 8 mg l for xz1 and 26 1 176 2 mg l for xz2 fig 4 below the depth of 4 5 m the cl content generally showed limited variation at 7 4 33 1 mg l with an average of 17 2 mg l for xz1 and 4 4 36 1 mg l with an average of 14 6 mg l for xz2 the cl content for the deep part of the unsaturated zone 30 m ranging from 4 4 to 22 9 mg l with an average of 10 8 mg l was close to the groundwater cl content at 4 0 10 9 mg l with an average of 5 5 mg l table 1 3 4 recharge estimation in 2018 55 years since 1963 a tritium peak of 7 5 m remained in the loess profile this peak in the layered homogeneous loess profile suggests homogeneous flow for soil water the soil water infiltration velocity is expected to be 0 14 m yr 7 5 m 55 yr the average volumetric water content above 7 5 m is 28 2 correspondingly the recharge rate based on tritium peak methods is 39 mm yr 0 14 1000 28 2 mm yr table 4 this infiltration velocity and recharge rate represents the average value since 1963 according to the systematical observation of precipitation cl deposition in a rural monitoring station in the vicinity of xi an china eanet 2018 the volume weighted average cl concentration in rainfall cp from 2000 to 2015 was 1 1 mg l the annual cl input from the atmosphere is expected to be 601 mg m2 yr 546 mm yr 1 1 mg l this value may involve up to 30 of uncertainty i e 421 781 mg m2 yr owing to possible dry deposition and the historic variation in atmospheric cl deposition edmunds et al 1988 gates et al 2011 huang and pang 2011 in addition the weighted average cl content in guyuan about 120 km from the study area fig 1 was 0 8 mg l from june 2018 to may 2019 within the scope of uncertainty because the cl in the upper unsaturated zone may have been affected by human activities soil water cl below 8 m i e that recharged before 1960 based on an infiltration velocity of 0 14 m yr was used for recharge estimation based on the cmb method the weighted average cl below 8 m for xz1 and xz2 was 16 1 mg l and 14 6 mg l and the recharge rate was estimated to be 37 11 mm yr and 41 12 mm yr respectively table 4 the infiltration velocity based on these recharge rates can be calculated the average volumetric water content below 8 m was 30 6 and 31 6 for xz1 and xz2 and the infiltration velocity was 0 12 0 04 m yr and 0 13 0 04 m yr respectively the recharge rates of 37 41 mm yr based on the tritium peak method and the cmb method accounting for 6 8 7 5 of annual precipitation when the area of the xifeng loess tableland is 812 km2 li 2015 the total recharge is estimated to be 3 0 3 2 107 m3 yr based on the results of this study 3 5 groundwater chemistry the groundwater chemical compositions table 1 show a narrow variation the tds was 270 316 mg l except for xf17 which showed 225 mg l and the average tds value of all groundwater was 288 mg l the dominant anion was hco3 at 88 in meq l and the cations varied from ca mg to na the groundwater cl contents ranged from 4 0 mg l to 10 9 mg l with an average of 5 5 mg l and the br cl mass ratio was 0 0034 0 0061 excluding xf13 which showed 0 0026 with an average of 0 0045 mg l these values are equal to or exceed the marine ratio of 0 0034 which suggests that the cl in the groundwater likely originated from marine water or marine derived airborne water i e from atmospheric deposition mazor 2004 edmunds et al 2006 3 6 stable isotopes from precipitation to soil water and groundwater according to the event based precipitation analysis for water stable isotopes from june 2018 to june 2019 the stable isotopic compositions show wide variation with δ18o ranging from 13 3 to 0 7 and δ2h ranging from 95 8 to 6 5 fig 5 all of the precipitation samples were obtained near the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 fig 5 the isotopic composition for the weighted average monthly precipitation showed that during the prevailing monsoon in july and august which are the warmest seasons in the year the δ18o values generally decreased this is consistent with the six year monthly precipitation observation for gnip station xi an near the lpc iaea wmo 2019 and the one year event based precipitation observation in guyuan unpublished data the locations of which are shown in fig 1 in the middle and high latitude areas stable isotopes are normally depleted in winter and enriched in summer clark and fritz 1997 however in the lpc the summer rainfall is controlled by the east asian monsoon wei and lin 1994 araguás araguás et al 1998 kong et al 2019 which results in stable isotope depletion from july to august the stable isotopic compositions for soil water and groundwater showed relatively narrow variation compared with precipitation fig 6 the δ18o for the soil water ranges mainly from 11 to 9 with a water content weighted average of 10 6 the δ18o for the groundwater ranged from 10 5 to 9 7 with an average of 10 2 however the annual weighted average δ18o for precipitation is 8 5 the δ18o values between soil water and groundwater are very close however the soil water showed relatively greater depletion in δ2h fig 5 the stable isotopic composition for the free groundwater at the water table 54 55 m xz1 was 10 0 for δ18o and 72 8 for δ2h xf25 and 10 0 for δ18o and 73 2 for δ2h for the duplicate sample xf26 however the stable isotopic composition for the soil water from the same borehole was 9 9 for δ18o and 76 9 for δ2h 54 54 5 m and 10 9 for δ18o and 79 6 for δ2h 54 5 55 m fig 5 this could have been caused by the uncertainty in soil water δ2h and δ18o analysis which can result in wide isotopic variance depending on the extraction method orlowski et al 2019 3 7 groundwater age the soil water infiltration velocity is estimated to be 0 12 0 14 m yr based on tritium peak and cmb methods table 4 when considering all of the uncertainties discussed in section 3 4 the velocity would be 0 08 0 17 m yr soil water recharged after 1950 reached depths of only 10 m and no tritium was detected below that depth fig 4 the thickness of the unsaturated zone in xifeng ranges from 40 m to 75 m qu 1991 therefore a period of 230 940 years is required for the annual precipitation to reach the water table if the soil water flow is dominantly piston like the results show that all of the groundwater is tritium free table 2 suggesting that it was recharged prior to 1950 here 14c is used to further evaluate the groundwater age the groundwater at the water table in sample xf25 had a 14c value of 43 8 pmc and a δ13c value of 8 7 tritium was not detected because the initial recharging water should be pre modern without 3h it should have been recharged most recently the groundwater at the water table could meet this condition considering that the uncertainty of groundwater 14c age is typically 1000 2000 years buckau et al 2000 geyh 2000 hart et al 2010 the initial recharging water used for correcting groundwater 14c age has a 14c value of 45 pmc and δ13c of 8 7 the saturation indices of calcite si cal of xf25 calculated by using phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 1999 was larger than 0 suggesting that the calcite has been oversaturated in addition si cal for all other groundwaters are all larger than 0 table 1 indicating that the calcite levels were oversaturated in loess the δ13c of carbonate ranges from 8 3 to 3 3 with average of 5 8 table 3 consistent with the value 8 5 to 3 6 from previous study in the xifeng ning et al 2006 if additional carbon dissolution occurred or an exchange with carbonate for groundwater in the aquifer the δ13c would have increased pearson 1965 however there no decreasing trend was shown for δ13c when the 14c decreased fig 7 which suggests that 14c decay is responsible for the decrease in the groundwater 14c content in xifeng this means that 45 pmc can be directly used as the initial value for correcting the groundwater 14c age a0 45 pmc the results in table 2 show the corrected 14c age ranges from 220 years in groundwater sample xf25 at the water table to 19 220 years b p the general trend is such that the corrected 14c age increases with an increase in well depth table 1 and table 2 this study shows that the shallow groundwater in the loess aquifer of the tableland is composed of pre modern water and old water up to tens of thousands of years in age 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with other studies generally speaking in homogeneous soil such as that containing sand loam and silt the soil water moves downward mainly by piston flow zimmermann et al 1967 dafny and šimůnek 2016 stone and edmunds 2016 min et al 2017 lichner et al 2018 this is further confirmed by the labeled 2h and 3h pulses zimmermann et al 1967 foster and smith carington 1980 koeniger et al 2016 and 1963 3h smith et al 1970 anderson and sevel 1974 zhang et al 1990 baran et al 2007 in loamy including loess and sandy soils demonstrating piston displacement of the tracer peak therefore this theory has gained acceptance by hydrogeologists downing et al 1979 darling and bath 1988 phillips 1994 edmunds and tyler 2002 liu et al 2009 min et al 2018 a tritium peak of 235 tu has been reported in chinese loess at a depth of 10 5 m in 1998 lin and wei 2006 in addition a tritium peak of 64 tu in french loess at depth of 9 3 m was reported in 2002 baran et al 2007 that of 46 66 tu was reported in chinese loess depths of 6 5 11 0 m in 2015 zhang et al 2017 li et al 2018 2019 and that of 55 2 tu was found in chinese loess at a depth of 7 5 m in 2018 this study in addition 3h peak displacement the breakthrough curves obtained for cl and no3 and tritiated water from six undisturbed columns of loess demonstrate that homogeneous infiltration is an intrinsic characteristic of loess el etreiby and laudelout 1988 in soil water numerical simulation research piston flow is always assumed as the dominant water flow in layered loessial deposits dafny and šimůnek 2016 turkeltaub et al 2018 the recharge rates of 37 41 mm yr based on the tritium peak method and the cmb method accounting for 6 8 7 5 of annual precipitation are very similar to the values of 38 mm yr and 6 7 recorded in 1974 1980 based on the water mass balance method qu 1991 the recharge rates based on the tritium peak method 39 mm yr and the cmb methods 37 41 mm yr are very similar which is very common in arid and semiarid recharge estimation edmunds et al 1988 allison et al 1994 scanlon et al 2006 4 2 evidences for conceptual model 4 2 1 water ages if the soil water infiltrates mainly by the piston flow mode the low infiltration velocity of 0 12 0 14 m yr and thick unsaturated zone of 40 75 m would result in a long infiltration time table 1 no tritium was detected in groundwater from the water table xf25 or from wells with depths of 60 180 m table 2 4 2 2 cl distributions the high value of cl in the upper unsaturated zone was affected by recent human activities such as the use of fertilizers before the 1960s however the use of fertilizers was very limited in china averaging less than 2 4 kg hm2 zhang et al 1996 correspondingly the cl at the deep part of the unsaturated zone was relatively low the average cl content in the deep part 30 m of the two soil profiles was 10 8 mg l which overlaps the groundwater cl content of 4 0 10 9 mg l fig 4 this also suggests a piston like flow mode butler and verhagen 2001 one cannot expect total equality of the cl content between deep soil water and groundwater which indicates that the groundwater receives piston like diffuse recharge from only soil water infiltration the soil water cl content was 8 1 mg l from 54 m to 54 5 m and 9 1 mg l from 54 5 m to 55 m according to the dilution extraction method discussed in section 2 2 however the free groundwater cl content at the same depth range 54 55 m was 5 9 mg l xf25 and 5 5 mg l for duplicate sample xf26 table 1 which should be theoretically equal this is also true for the other loess tablelands chen et al 2012 li et al 2017 such as the zhengning loess tableland fig 1 where the groundwater cl content is 4 2 8 6 mg l and the average soil water cl content is 10 6 mg l 6 46 5 m and 13 6 mg l 6 62 m for two deep soil profiles huang et al 2017 gee et al 2005 found that the cl concentration in the free drain waters are obviously lower than cl concentration in soil water using dilution method as the commonly used methods to measure cl concentration in soil water and suggested that for low cl concentration in soil water the dilution method is not robust besides because the asian monsoon caused a fluctuation change during the last 20 000 years yang et al 2015 the atmospheric cl deposition may have also changed even in recent years the annual cl input has shown a large variation of 156 1521 mg m2 yr from 2000 to 2015 eanet 2018 when using cmb we assume that cl in soil originates from atmospheric deposition and atmospheric deposition of cl is stable in history time actually there is at least 10 of the variation for atmospheric deposition as the main uncertainty for the use of cmb method to estimate groundwater recharge rate edmunds et al 1988 the fluctuation of cl concentrations in soil profile below the root zone is generally interpreted as the valuation of climate with low cl concentration suggesting wet period and high cl concentration suggesting dry period cook et al 1992 edmunds and tyler 2002 stone and edmunds 2016 4 2 3 stable isotopes although the annual weighted average δ18o for precipitation was 8 5 the soil water and groundwater with more depleted δ18o values fig 5 were obviously recharged by seasonal large rainfall i e summer monsoon precipitation depletion of heavy isotopes in groundwater relative to the mean precipitation has frequently been observed in many arid and semiarid areas jasechko 2019 such as southern africa vogel and urk 1975 the southern great basin usa tyler et al 1996 the kherlen river basin eastern mongolia tsujimura et al 2007 and the north china plain von rohden et al 2010 and guyuan china huang et al 2013 the precipitation amount from july to september accounts for 55 of the annual precipitation in xifeng such depletion has been attributed to selective infiltration of rainfall from intense large volume isotopically light rainfall events although the average temperature during the late pleistocene was lower than that during the holocene the δ18o values were similar for groundwater recharged during these two epochs table 2 the slightly different isotopic compositions of δ2h between soil water and groundwater should be interpreted as a result from extracting method rather than evaporation process or other recharge mechanism comparing water stable isotopic composition between soil water and groundwater is not a very robust way to conclude that groundwater is not recharged by soil water by piston flow the similarity of stable isotopes throughout the profile also suggests a threshold of precipitation is needed to drive percolation past the rooting zone partly confirming that preferential flow is not obvious 4 2 4 water table dynamics the soil water content at a depth of 1 5 m at a loess monitoring site with a water table depth of 14 m in bulgaria where loess and loess like sediments cover approximately 11 of the bulgarian territory mostly in northern part of the country showed a relatively constant range during an 18 month observation gerginov et al 2018 at depths below 4 m the soil water content showed very limited variation qu 1991 qiu 1992 chen et al 2008 under the piston flow model with a thick unsaturated zone the recharge signal is smooth the groundwater water monitoring data recorded in the luochuan tableland with conditions similar to those in the study area showed that changes in the water table during the 1960s 1970s were narrow and were close to natural conditions with little pumpage qu 1991 evidently the groundwater was recharged by diffuse infiltration in the piston flow mode through the thick loess unsaturated zone however the water table in xifeng has decreased 5 14 m in general up to a maximum of 28 m during the recent 30 years owing to large extraction since the 1980s li 2015 4 2 5 conceptual model the recharge mechanism is always complicated for any aquifer flint et al 2002 and the preferential flow of soil water exists widely in the upper part of the unsaturated zone especially in the root zone gazis and feng 2004 stumpp and maloszewski 2010 this study combined evaluations of soil water infiltration velocity recharge rate and determination of groundwater age at a water table in a loess tableland the integrated isotopic and chemical observation from precipitation soil water and groundwater especially from the water table revealed comprehensive recharge processes a conceptual recharge model is given in fig 4 the results showed that soil water recharged from precipitation during the past decades remained in the upper 10 m and that the time required for annual precipitation to reach the water table is hundreds of years no 3h was detected in the groundwater samples and the corrected 14c ages ranged from 220 years for groundwater at the water table with a depth of 54 m to 19 220 years accordingly the cl content remained low at 4 0 10 9 mg l and the nitrate remained at the baseline level from nitrification of soil n therefore the soil water in this layered homogeneous loess of silt and silt loam infiltrated mainly via piston like flow mode on a macroscopic scale below the root zone therefore the 3h and soil cmb methods which are based on piston flow can be used in loess aquifers to assess diffuse recharge rate the combined evaluations of the unsaturated zone with those of the saturated zone and the use of multiple environmental tracers can be considered as a generic framework for evaluating recharge processes in arid and semiarid areas with thick unsaturated zones at macroscopic and field scales 5 conclusions combined evaluations of the unsaturated zone with those of the saturated zone and the use of multiple environmental tracers such as cl no3 br 2h 18o 13c 3h and 14c provides a generic framework for evaluating recharge processes especially piston and preferential flow in arid and semiarid areas with thick unsaturated zones at macroscopic and field scales the 1963 thermonuclear 3h peak still exists in the loess unsaturated zone as one of the most robust markers for tracing soil water infiltration processes especially in arid and semiarid areas where the infiltration velocity is slow the results from this study showed that in the xifeng loess tableland the time required for annual precipitation to reach the water table ranged from decades to hundreds of years therefore the groundwater age ranges from hundreds of years to 20 000 years tritium free no modern preferential recharge of the groundwater has occurred since the 1950s however the groundwater receives a continuous diffuse recharge of 3 0 3 2 107 m3 yr through the thick unsaturated zone because the characteristics of loess over the world are similar the homogeneous infiltration piston flow may be an intrinsic characteristic of loess
