24675,solar ultraviolet uv radiation and uv b 280 320 nm in particular has been shown to be partially responsible for adverse effects on zooplankton throughout the world from damaged dna to altered population dynamics to cope with these effects copepods have developed several protective systems including avoiding extended and intense periods of exposure how much uv b exposure a cohort of thousands of spawners can withstand remains unknown to evaluate the post exposure effects of uv b radiation on reproduction in egg carrying copepods we developed an individual based model ibm that integrates in vivo data we calibrated the ibm for a small cyclopoid copepod species paracyclopina nana which is a biological model used in both ecotoxicology and aquaculture our findings improve our understanding of the species response to uv b radiation significant radiative effects include decreased reproductive success at 0 7 kj m 2 and offspring production at 0 6 kj m 2 the model predicted fewer than 500 females from an original cohort of 1000 would survive for five days after exposure to 1 kj m2 and 50 offspring suppression eight days after exposure to 1 kj m 2 this integrative model highlighted the importance of female longevity in maintaining a viable population at doses below 2 kj m 2 and that of hatching success for radiation levels exceeding 2 kj m 2 p nana appeared to be a sensitive species at 25 c but improvements in the model such as incorporation of temperature variation effects and recovery mechanisms should provide better estimates of the species sensitivity to uv b graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords individual based model simulation uv b effect emergence population endpoints 1 introduction compared with chemical pollution ultraviolet uv exposure covers a wider area is more regular in time and the source is beyond an organism s control global warming has led to a decrease in the extent and duration of ice and snow cover on oceans and inland waters as a result underwater environments in polar and alpine regions are now exposed to greater levels of uv radiation clark et al 2013 frey et al 2011 häder et al 2015 uv radiation is also expected to increase in tropical zones in the 21st century due to diminishing cloud cover and stratospheric ozone bais et al 2011 a risk assessment tool that can quantify how much uv radiation aquatic populations can withstand is therefore topical and relevant uv radiation is associated with positive and negative effects on aquatic organisms häder et al 2015 williamson et al 2014 the life essential provitamin d produced by phytoplankton and zooplankton has provided protection from uv radiation for millions of years holick 2003 1989 in fish uv plays a consequential role in feeding and mate selection leech and johnsen 2003 seehausen et al 2008 short term exposure to uv radiation increases resistance to parasites in daphnia overholt et al 2012 however sub lethal doses can cause protein and dna damage kim et al 2011 puthumana et al 2017 rhee et al 2012 impair reproduction won et al 2014 weaken resistance to disease williamson and rose 2010 decrease swimming performance fukunishi et al 2012 alter respiration rates fischer et al 2006 and disrupt population dynamics wang et al 2011 finally despite some degree of tolerance which varies among taxa excessive uv radiation inevitably leads to mortality in zooplankton borgeraas and hessen 2000 hansson and hylander 2009 leech and williamson 2000 this poses two questions how much uv radiation is beneficial and over what threshold does it becomes deleterious for an organism and put entire populations at risk defining the critical tipping point is important as changes in climate and stratospheric ozone concentrations are altering surface uv exposure levels williamson et al 2014 in the aquatic realm copepoda are a dominant if not the largest group constituting a significant portion of the zooplankton community longhurst 1985 copepods link producers to higher trophic levels e g macrobenthos or nekton dhont et al 2013 kainz et al 2004 and have been considered bioindicators of environmental change due to their short life cycle and the ease with which they can be maintained under laboratory conditions kwok et al 2015 raisuddin et al 2007 planktonic copepods are appropriate ecotoxicological models as they are distributed in a wide range of environments and are sensitive to diverse environmental stressors e g salinity trace metals and uv and gamma radiation hwang et al 2010 kwok et al 2015 won et al 2015 2014 won and lee 2014 for the small cyclopoid paracyclopina nana several molecular mechanisms have been studied thoroughly dahms et al 2016 and its entire genome has been sequenced zhou et al 2019 making it a useful biological model for ecotoxicology the most damaging short wavelength radiation reaching the earth s surface uv b 280 315 nm can penetrate water to depths of approximately 55 m and numerous experiments have established that uv b radiation can have detrimental effects on copepods fukunishi et al 2012 han et al 2016 kim et al 2011 only one study has shown increased survival and reproduction after exposure to uv b but the reason was not identified cooke and williamson 2006 most studies have found uv b radiation exerts harmful effects on different traits in copepods including survival ban et al 2007 lacuna and uye 2000 ma et al 2013 2012 feeding behavior lacuna and uye 2000 ma et al 2012 respiration and excretion ma et al 2013 more recent studies focusing on reproduction won et al 2014 and growth won et al 2015 in p nana have provided high quality uv dose response data uv radiation appears to cause increased mortality and damage in eggs inhibition of hatching and increased expression of antioxidant enzymes won et al 2014 higher production rates of base excision repair associated genes and heat shock protein chaperoning genes were observed in uv irradiated p nana likely leading to deleterious effects on growth and reproduction won et al 2015 copepods have evolved several mechanisms for minimizing their exposure to and protecting themselves from uv radiation including physiological processes and behavioral strategies ban et al 2007 overholt et al 2016 tartarotti et al 2017 for example substances conferring defensive abilities such as mycosporine like amino acid and astaxanthin brüsin et al 2016 hessen 2002 hylander et al 2014 tartarotti et al 2004 2017 have been found in their diet even with such mechanisms long term exposure to uv b can induce post exposure effects but to our knowledge no study has quantified effects on copepods molecular analyses can explain many of the mechanisms enhanced during exposure to uv b at the sub organism level han et al 2016 won et al 2015 2014 nevertheless extrapolating the consequences of these processes to the population scale requires a specific approach establishing a causality link between different biological organization levels is necessary to demonstrate the ecological relevance of molecular and cellular responses and to establish links between a stressor source and responses in vivo e g hanson 2009 several approaches are available to increase our ability to understand emerging processes that act across scales among them the adverse outcome pathway aop ankley et al 2010 and individual based model ibm topping et al 2009 have been proposed the aop approach which is similar to functional modeling souissi et al 2003 is a theoretical framework that provides a structured representation of existing knowledge of action modes at the cellular level in the laboratory and the projection of consequences adverse outcomes at the biological level of organization are more pertinent ecologically ankley et al 2010 lee et al 2015b however the aop approach is conceptual and cannot provide a quantitative extrapolation of the effect of a given stressor at the population scale it is therefore essential to couple this approach with numerical extrapolation gust et al 2016 a combination of an aop approach and a matrix population model allowed coulaud et al 2015 to demonstrate the effect of feeding inhibition on the population dynamics of gammarus models provide simulation tools to quantify and extrapolate the effect of perturbations at the population scale an ibm represents an appropriate approach to integrating the effect of perturbations over several organizational levels forbes et al 2008 preuss et al 2010 by definition ibm integers explicitly serve as links between individuals and populations souissi et al 2003 ibms also have the capacity to combine stochasticity and individual variability both of which play important roles in population dynamics and stability under unfavorable conditions bi and liu 2017 consequently ibms are being used to extrapolate individual level scenarios generated in the laboratory to realistic conditions at the population level in ecological risk assessments beaudouin et al 2015 forbes et al 2011 gabsi et al 2014 kulkarni et al 2014 preuss et al 2010 most ibms for copepods have been developed to study multiple pollution stresses korsman et al 2014 kulkarni et al 2014 but have quantified the effects of uv b in this study we examined the effects of uv b radiation on reproduction in a cohort composed by females using an ibm developed on the mobidyc platform ginot et al 2002 to simulate the reproductive cycle of an egg bearing copepods dur et al 2009 the model description follows the overview design concepts and details protocol proposed by grimm et al 2006 2010 2020 model calibration used experimental results from studies of the effect of uv b radiation on p nana won et al 2015 2014 and from experience accumulated studying this species for several years unpublished data on the reproductive cycle collected by j s lee s laboratory team following the calibration the ibm was used to investigate the post exposure effect of uv b on reproductive traits and success at the scale of a cohort of 1000 females 2 material and methods 2 1 purpose and patterns the model s higher level purpose was to predict the impact of uv b negative outcomes on the recruitment of egg carrying copepods more specifically the model was designed to quantify the post exposure effect of uv b radiation on reproductive traits and success in a copepod cohort of 1000 individuals the model was calibrated for the copepod p nana based on laboratory observations won et al 2014 2015 we evaluated our model by its ability to reproduce two patterns at the individual level a decrease in mortality and fecundity of females with increasing dose of uv b radiation at the cohort level an overall decrease in egg and offspring production by a group of females in response to a higher dose of uv b radiation 2 2 entities state variables and scales spatial scale the model was not spatially explicit the agents were not located in geometrical space temporal scale the simulation ran with a time step fixed at three hours and lasted 25 days which is the maximum lifespan of a p nana female at 25 c unpublished data entities the model included two kinds of entity predefined in mobidyc located agents and non located agents ginot et al 2002 the two located agents represented 1 a p nana individual of the adult female stage and 2 an individual of the first naupliar stage as p nana is an egg carrier reproduction is relatively complex and involves a multi phase cycle dur et al 2009 adult females of p nana have been credited with several state variables called attributes in mobidyc table 1 the nauplii are represented in the model only to evaluate the effect of uv b on hatching success the nauplii of a clutch hatch synchronously and die at the second time step following the hatching after being counted the state variable of the nauplii is therefore age only the non located agents of mobidyc were used to design the model and collect required data from the simulation ginot et al 2002 the three first non located agents were used to store global variables reducing the number of attributes carried by the located agents table 2 paramdev contained the parameter values of the normal distribution used to introduce individual variability on female s life span paramsur reflected the survival probability of the females and how it varied following exposure to a given dose of uv b radiation paramrepro stored all parameters of the normal distribution used to introduce individual variability on the clutch size cs embryonic development time edt and latency time lt paramrepro also stored the value of hatching success hs which varied with the uv b dose received by the female and the post exposure time two additional non located agents were used to represent the environment and the experimenter the environment agent envi referred to the overall environment including the post exposure time matching the simulation time temperature fixed at 25 c and the uv b dose received by the females the experimenter agent scientist recorded the age of the female at time of death and the number of eggs and nauplii produced throughout the simulation 2 3 process overview and scheduling 2 3 1 summary 1 the non located agent envi executes its growolder submodel with increments for its state variable time of three hours 2 the non located agent paramrepro executes its effectuvhs submodel which computes the value of hs in relation to the uv b dose and envi time 3 the non located agent paramsurv executes its effectuvsurv submodel which calculates the survival probability of the adult females psurvadf in relation to post exposure time 4 the adult female agents each execute different tasks simulating the reproductive cycle a schematic representation of the reproductive cycle and the flowchart of the submodel scheduling are provided in figs 1 and 2 respectively in dur et al 2009 the located female agents execute their submodels in the following order a survive which defines whether they will live or die during the time step b defimptime which defines the longevity of the female when the female s age is 0 and the latencytime to produce the subsequent clutch every time the female is non ovigerous and has a latence of 0 c timecumul which increases the female age latence and devembryo by one time step i e three hours d eggproduct which sets the ovigerous status to 1 calculates a new value of clutchsize and embryodt and resets the value of latence and devembryo when the proper conditions for spawning are met cf submodel section e reproduce which creates nauplius 1 agents and resets to zero the attributes ovigerous devembryo latence and clutchsize f die which kills the individual when age exceeds longevity 5 the naupliar 1 agents only survive until counted 2 3 2 rationale the envi is scheduled first because the subsequent paramsurv action depends on the time step in the female agent the submodel defimptime occurs before timecumul to allow the computation of the required latencytime just after the hatching process i e reproduction and the latencytime of the first clutch eggproduct has to occur before reproduction to allow the proper condition and timing for hatching finally scientist actions take place at the end of the time step 2 4 design concepts basic principles our model simulates the consequence of intermittent exposure to uv b radiation on a cohort of females we hypothesized that after exposure the simulated females would avoid uv b radiation by migrating deeper into the water column lampert 1989 ohman and romagnan 2016 alternatively the simulation can also represent the case of intertidal copepod females that escaped with the flood from a tide pool where they could not avoid uv b radiation martin et al 2000 the simulation followed the cohort of females after they escaped and therefore these females did not receive more radiation during the simulation in this model the uv b dose received before escaping affected the survival rate of the females and the hatching success of the eggs to determine the effects we used empirical relationships see submodel below another set of hypotheses concerned the relationship between uv b dose and hs see submodel below the experimental results described a relationship between uv b dose and the percentage of individuals with damaged eggs won et al 2014 all damaged eggs were considered non viable and the non damaged eggs were all viable emergence the key outcomes of the model were the distribution of reproductive traits at the individual scale female longevity clutch number brood size daily egg production dep fecundity total offspring production and cumulated production of eggs and offspring by a female cohort among those results all emerged from the effect of uv b dose on survival rates and the hatching success with the exception of female longevity this outcome was more a direct product of the effect of uv b dose on female survival rate adaptation adaptation was not implemented in the model objectives objectives measurements were not implemented in the model learning learning was not implemented in the model prediction the model included no prediction process fitness individual fitness was determined by female survival rate longevity cs lt edt and hs although the consequences of variations in fitness at higher levels can be quantified the present study did not address this question sensing the state variable ovigerous defined the proper time to perform appropriate reproductive tasks e g spawning and hatching post exposure time pet was also measured as cs and hs values were related to pet interactions interactions between individuals were not introduced in the present model we assumed that the mating was implicitly included in latency time neither the limitations due to mating nor the failure of egg fertilization was considered here stochasticity survival was interpreted as a random variable a survival rate of 95 means an individual will die only if the generated random number belonging to a uniform probability density between 0 1 is larger than 0 95 stochasticity was used to assign each female a life span see the submodel section lt edt and cs are also stochastic as their values were drawn randomly from predefined distributions see the submodel section after the hatching process for lt and the spawning process for edt and cs of each clutch produced collectives the model included no collectives observation an additional non located agent scientist a saved the value of cs and age of death of the female and b counts the number of nauplii produced and extracts them from the simulation this procedure allowed total egg and offspring production to be recorded but also investigated the distribution of different reproductive traits see emergence 2 5 initialization at initialization the female cohort consisted of 1000 newly molted adult females i e age 0 this number of individuals was selected after visualization of the stabilization of the mean and variability of the output variables supplementary materials figure s1 at the beginning of the simulation we assumed that the females had received a dose of uv b radiation before migrating away from the stress the beginning of the simulation marked the beginning of the post exposure time twenty one uv b conditions were tested with doses ranging between 0 and 10 kj m 2 for each condition the simulated experiments were repeated 15 times 15 replicates to consider the output variability produced by the same set of parameters and initial conditions supplementary materials figure s2 2 6 input the temperature was fixed at 25 c similar to the experimental conditions of won et al 2014 the model did not use input data to represent time varying processes 2 7 submodels 2 7 1 reproductive cycle of a female to simulate the reproductive cycle of the females we adapted a model developed by dur et al 2009 with slight modification to the case of p nana unlike the dur et al 2009 model individual variability was not represented by a gamma distribution but a gaussian distribution we therefore modified the tasks defimptime and eggproduct table 3 presents the different tasks used to simulate the reproductive cycle of p nana and their respective pseudocodes for the rationales behind these tasks see dur et al 2009 2 7 2 effect of uv b on the copepod to study the effect of uv b on p nana we used the results from the experiment conducted by won et al 2014 on the effect of uv b radiation on in vivo end points for reproductive success details on the experimental procedures and data used for calibration are presented in supplementary materials text s1 and table s1 and s2 2 7 3 effect on female survival won et al 2014 found that the survival of females exposed to different doses of uv b radiation decreased with dose and post exposure time to parameterize this double effect we first investigated the relationship between the survival and the post exposure time for each uv b dose a gaussian formula satisfactorily represented the relationship between those two parameters for each dose 1 s a e t c 2 where s represents the survival rate and t the elapsed time following irradiation in hours supplementary material table s3 provides the results of those fits we then examined for the relationship between uv b dose and the parameters a c of eq 1 the relation between uv b dose and a was well fitted with a third order polynomial regression fig 1 a a power law expressed c in relation to uv b dose fig 1 b 2 7 4 effect on hatching success to measure dysfunction in hatching won et al 2014 counted the number of dropped egg clutches effects of uv radiation were only observed for uv b doses greater than 2 kj m 2 the number of dropped eggs increased with radiation dose and post exposure time using these results we examined the effect of uv b exposure and post radiation time on hs by applying the following hypothesis 1 all damaged eggs were non viable and 2 non damaged eggs were viable we then defined hs as 100 percentage of damaged eggs as observed by won et al 2014 for survival we graphically examined the relationship between hatching success and post radiation time the measured skewness of the relationship fig 2 a led us to apply the inverse of a gamma function to model hs as a function of pet 2 h s d c g a m c d f t α β where t is the post exposure time in hours and α and β represent the respective shape and scale parameters of the gamma function we then investigated the relationship between the parameters of eq 2 and uv b dose the α and β parameters of the gamma function exhibited neither clear variation in function of uv b dose nor strong variability among the different conditions of radiation coefficient of variation 0 43 we therefore chose to keep the values of the α and β parameters constant at 2 759 and 6 291 respectively once the gamma distribution parameters were fixed the other parameters of eq 2 c and d exhibited clearer relationships with increasing uv b doses we used an exponential function to represent the relationship between eq 2 c and radiation dose fig 2 b and modeled eq 2 d as a function of uv b radiation with a linear function fig 2 c integrating these two models in eq 2 we simulated the hs value as a function of the uv b dose and pet fig 2 d 3 results 3 1 effect of uv b on individual end points the numerical outputs provided a dynamical explanation for the effect of uv radiation on the total production of p nana fig 3 as implemented in the model female longevity was strongly affected by radiation dose from 12 days to 1 day of average longevity for no radiation and following a 10 kj m 2 radiation respectively individual variability in longevity decreased with increasing uv radiation consequently the number of clutches a female could produce in its life followed a similar trend for both average values and individual variability nevertheless variability in the number of clutches stabilized at 0 45 clutch per females at radiation doses greater than 4 kj m 2 contrary to the results for female longevity and the number of clutches brood size displayed a different relationship with increasing uv radiation while the average brood size remained constant i e 13 6 eggs clutch despite increasing radiation doses the variability of brood size increased rapidly with increasing radiation dose until reaching a plateau with approximately 3 7 eggs clutch at 0 kj m 2 the standard deviation doubled at 4 kj m 2 as a result daily egg production dep exhibited a similar pattern the average number of eggs produced per day per female was constant at 6 9 but variability increased with radiation the standard deviation in dep for no radiation was approximately 1 9 eggs day female and reached 7 8 eggs day female at 10 kj m 2 of radiation the resulting response in average total number of eggs produced by a female over its life fecundity followed a trend similar to that of female longevity average fecundity decreased rapidly with radiation and after a 7 kj m 2 dose of radiation fecundity fell by 87 and continued decreasing as radiation exposure rose supplementary material figure s3 the fecundity variability diminished with increasing radiation dose up to 5 kj m 2 beyond this dose fecundity remained relatively constant as a result of decreasing variability in female lifespan and increasing variability in cs the effect of radiation on hs has consequences for the next generation production the response in total number of offspring to increasing radiation followed a trend similar to that of fecundity but the decrease was faster and stronger after exposure to 6 kj m 2 no offspring hatched compared with an average of nine eggs produced for the same condition supplementary material figure s3 analysis of the distribution of parameter values confirmed the previously observed effect of radiation on variability fig 4 and the strong importance of female longevity for the control condition no radiation all parameters exhibited a normal distribution for all parameters besides brood size and dep the distributions shifted toward zero with increasing uv b dose and became increasingly narrower the span of total offspring distribution shrank much faster than that of fecundity with increasing radiation dose meanwhile brood size distributions flattened out the dep distribution center slid slightly toward the lower class with a tail toward higher classes 3 2 uv b effect on cohort end points at the cohort level the model revealed the importance of female longevity on production at doses below 2 kj m 2 and that of hatching success at doses greater than 2 kj m 2 fig 5 the number of reproductive cycles the peaks in fig 5 top graphs rapidly decreased with increasing radiation females exposed to 8 kj m 2 could still produce one clutch the effect of female longevity was important at low radiation doses and decreased slightly with increasing radiation dose the difference in cumulative egg production between two radiations doses decreased with increasing dose a 0 5 kj m 2 dose of radiation led to a 40 loss in cumulated egg production between 0 5 and 1 kj m 2 the cumulative egg production exhibited a 20 decrease between 1 and 2 kj m 2 a 14 decrease and between 2 and 4 kj m 2 a 9 5 loss similar decreases were observed for the cumulative offspring production below 1 kj m 2 at 2 kj m 2 the effect of hatching success became dominant leading to dramatic effects between 1 and 2 kj m 2 total offspring production suffered a loss of 21 after irradiation of 8 kj m 2 no nauplii were produced 4 discussion the effects of uv radiation on aquatic invertebrates have been of great concern for the last two decades dahms and lee 2010 häder et al 2007 hylander et al 2015 hylander and hansson 2013 rautio and tartarotti 2010 the present study represents a preliminary step toward a risk assessment of the effects of uv b radiation on copepods here we focused on the effects on reproduction by first defining dose response relationships based on the results of laboratory experiments won et al 2015 2014 on female survival and hatching success we then applied those relationships to an ibm representing the reproductive cycle of egg carrying copepods dur et al 2009 the present study also demonstrated the benefits of a close collaboration between modelers and experimentalists as previously advocated koch et al 2017 zaccaria et al 2017 the results of this collaboration led to a model that enhances our ability to quantify the consequences of uv b radiation at the population level 4 1 from subcellular to population levels adverse outcome pathways facilitate the effective integration of diverse information acquired at different levels our current work expands on that of won et al 2015 2014 and allows us to enrich the aop on the responses to uv b radiation with additional information at a level beyond that of the organism fig 6 won et al 2014 reported the effects of uv b radiation at three levels at the molecular level uv b radiation modulated fatty acid composition and peroxidation of lipids this in turn activated an antioxidant mechanism that thwarts cellular necrosis or apoptosis while the response at the organ level remains unknown won et al 2014 also provided information on responses at the organism level including a reduction in egg production and hatching success and an increase in mortality combined these effects should affect the entire population the present study revealed 1 a strong decline in fecundity and offspring production 2 increased variability in brood size and daily egg production 3 declining population while most consequences were expected the present model allowed the quantification of those population level effects similar studies see topping et al 2009 have endorsed ibms as useful tools to predict and quantify responses at the population scale using data collected at the individual scale and consequently realized ecological risks assessment forbes et al 2019 2017 the effects of a toxicant on an organism are multidimensional and involve different life traits ibms such as the one presented here allow us to integrate this multidimensionality and can be used to systematically explore system resilience egli et al 2019 the current version of the presented model is not elaborated well enough to allow such a risk evaluation to be operational the model would need to consider the effect of temperature and the different responses at all life stages see toward environmental risk assessment below however our model does provide important information particularly about the sensitivity of the selected species 4 2 sensitivity of p nana the developed model combined the effects of uv b radiation on different aspects of the reproduction in an egg carrying copepod the cumulative effect can dramatically influence population maintenance and manifest itself at low exposure doses in the present study we found that even a subtly low dose of uv b radiation affects female survival and hs and could yield strong changes in population fecundity and fertility of a group of 1000 females was halved at 25 days after exposure to 0 7 and 0 6 kj m 2 of radiation respectively yet the median lethal dose ld50 of uv b radiation for p nana and other copepod species is more than 10 fold higher the ld50 of p nana is 21 2 kj m 2 won et al 2014 and the ld50 of acartia omorii is 22 0 kj m 2 lacuna and uye 2000 24 9 kj m 2 for boeckella poppei rocco et al 2002 and 25 kj m 2 for tigriopus japonicus kim et al 2015 our results emphasize the potential negative effects of stressors on a population even at sub lethal doses the results of our simulations also draw attention to the overall high sensitivity of p nana populations to uv b radiation p nana is sensitive to a variety of environmental and xenobiotic stressors dayras et al 2020 han et al 2015 hwang et al 2010 lee et al 2006 rhee et al 2012 won and lee 2014 zhou et al 2019 making it a useful indicator of environmental stress dahms et al 2016 in the peculiar case of uv radiation the species vulnerability is associated with a potential lack or low levels of photoprotective pigments such as astaxanthin and melanin unpigmented copepods are reportedly more sensitive to uv radiation compared with pigmented species byron 1982 ringelberg et al 1984 while observations of p nana have revealed a non colorful copepod a detailed analysis of the species photoprotective pigment concentration is needed to confirm this hypothesis and life stage differences in carotenoid content should also be taken into account lotocka et al 2004 the effect of uv b on reproductive success in p nana is unambiguous we identified a dramatic decrease in the production of eggs and the number of offspring this supports reports by karanas et al 1981 naganuma et al 1997 puthumana et al 2017 williamson et al 1994 and yu et al 2009 rodriguez et al 2000 reported a two fold decrease in egg production and naupliar deformities in calanus finmarchicus exposed to 145 175 kj m 2 of radiation however c finmarchicus hatching success was affected mainly by uv a rather than uv b rodriguez et al 2000 our results also revealed that exposure to uv b aggravates a decline in egg production throughout the life span of adult females this contradicts the finding of heine et al 2019 who reported no effect of uv radiation on the number of clutches produced per females in tigriopus californicus this discrepancy can be explained by the difference in dose level which was moderate in the heine et al 2019 experiments but also by the characteristics of t californicus which reportedly exhibits exceptional resistance to environmental stressors raisuddin et al 2007 rhee et al 2009 and antioxidant enzyme gpx and gr activities that protect against uv induced oxidative damage are likely high as observed in its congener kim et al 2015 t californicus lives in shallow pounds where uv radiation penetration is high making the ability to withstand such conditions and to cope with reactive oxygen a matter of survival however p nana is a planktonic cyclopoid copepod found in brackish waters and the population used by won et al 2015 2014 is from a brackish waterbody lake songji the degree of uv penetration in such a turbid environment is expected to be far lower than in a tidal pool considering the effect of suspended organic matter on uv b penetration boelen et al 1999 tedetti and sempere 2006 as a result strong protective mechanisms against uv were not selected in this population of p nana finally our results provide compelling evidence that individual variability in brood size increases with radiation dose they support previous work showing a greater degree of individual variability in the population under unfavorable conditions pfister and stevens 2002 warwick and clarke 1993 increased variability is considered indicative of approaching a tipping point or regime shift carpenter and brock 2006 hewitt and thrush 2010 scheffer et al 2009 however one set of studies showed that increases in individual variability in physiological traits are important for population resilience to environmental stress bi and liu 2017 richmond et al 2013 and for a population s ability to invade a new ecosystem goldwasser et al 1994 in our case the increase in brood size variability was associated with a decrease in cumulative nauplii production and an increase in variability in such production until it was null supplementary material figure s 4 however the observed increase in brood size variability may have been a consequence of the limited number of observations too few females which could have affected the distribution supplementary material figure s 5 it is therefore important to identify the source of such variation in individual variability in our case it is clear that the decreasing number of females due to the effect of uv radiation on mortality led to increased variability in brood size this was the result of stochasticity that only a model based on multi agent systems can integrate an ibm can integrate any other source of variability e g genetic and or plasticity if the relationship is proven or demonstrated experimentally further studies with the present model should test how increased variability at the individual scale can influence population recruitment 4 3 toward environmental risk assessments while the present model offers detailed process analysis and the ability to extrapolate results from the lab several points remain to be addressed before the model can be applied to environmental risk assessments temperature is the first influencing factor that needs to be considered in future versions of the model in the present study all runs were conducted at a constant temperature 25 c however because temperature affects the ability of the photo enzymatic repair per light repair mechanism for uv b induced dna damage in copepods gonçalves et al 2002 williamson et al 2002 it should be possible to integrate the effects of variable temperatures in an ibm i e dur et al 2013 the next step would be parameterization of the interaction between temperature and uv radiation which can first be designed theoretically based on literature the most frequently observed response in zooplankton is more efficient repair at higher temperatures macfadyen et al 2004 williamson et al 2002 controversial results from a study of enhanced per connelly et al 2009 and reduced phototoxic effects of uv radiation kumar et al 2015 at lower temperatures highlight the need to consider species specific responses for parameterization it is therefore appropriate to determine the relationships for a given species experimentally the current model can be used as a tool to provide feedback on future experiments with p nana consideration of temperature is also essential because copepods have developed behavioral strategies to avoid uv radiation that include migration toward deeper layers where temperatures are lower and this involves a correlated increase or decrease in phototoxic effects as well as a decrease in production leech et al 2009 an important point raised by gabsi et al 2014 is the fact that the effect on the f1 generation can control a population even more than survival can this must be taken into account to explain the effect of any xenobiotic factors at the population scale copepods accumulate photoprotective compounds such as astaxanthin by ingesting food tartarotti et al 2017 which provides protection against uv radiation hairston 1976 sommaruga 2010 concentrations of astaxanthin in copepods vary by population i e 0 4 1 8 µg mg dry weight for a cyclopoid copepod in the austrian alpine lakes tartarotti et al 2017 life stage lotocka et al 2004 and habitat properties tartarotti et al 2017 astaxanthin concentration appears to be a heritable trait in copepods gorokhova et al 2013 lotocka et al 2004 in the present ibm this could be implemented as the quantity of astaxanthin contained in each individual required to impart greater resistance to uv and that could be transmitted to progeny to allow them to stay in warmer surface waters where they experience higher reproductive output some toxicants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs exhibit increased toxicity after exposure to uv radiation this phototoxicity can have lethal consequences for aquatic organisms ankley et al 1995 bowling et al 1983 hatlen et al 2010 oris and giesy 1985 pelletier et al 1997 modeling approaches have been used to assess the risk of pah phototoxicity to fish ankley et al 1997 sellin jeffries et al 2013 similarly our model can integrate information on pah transfer from the water column to copepods cailleaud et al 2007 and estimate the risk posed by pah toxicity to egg carrying copepods several recent studies have investigated the in vivo effect of metals and emerging contaminants on p nana these include the effect of microplastics on molecular responses jeong et al 2017 the bioaccumulation and toxicity of metal cocktails dayras et al 2020 and the biotransformation and detoxification process of arsenic byeon et al 2020 the knowledge acquired through these studies at different levels from subcellular to population level is a useful asset as some ibms in the present study integrated the effect of those contaminants but a model that combines the effect of contaminants and uv radiation requires additional data about the cumulative or synergistic impact in other words a modeling approach can help define the specific experimental design that provides adequate data for calibration ibms applied to amenable species can produce population relevant data that are of the highest value to environmental risk assessments as regulations are almost always written to protect populations despite their evident efficiency the use of ibms for such assessments is rare forbes et al 2019 the main downside is the lack of data for model calibration and verification our results while encouraging should be validated through experiments conducted at the population scale or in a mesocosm our study also provides a framework for the future development of a model to assess the effects on an entire life cycle this will allow us to take into consideration entire post embryonic development as well as ontogenic sensitivity to uv radiation yu et al 2009 following conclusive tests and an thorough validation our model could be used to predict the effects of uv radiation at the population scale bringing us a step closer to an effective environmental risk assessment tool 5 conclusion the present study brought quantitative insights to our understanding of p nana reproduction dynamics following exposure to uv b radiation the model can be generalized to other egg carrying species our results shed light on the population level effects of uv radiation on sexually reproducing crustaceans in general the model can also be extended to the entire life cycle an ibm approach should help overcome difficulties acquiring appropriate data for calibration measurement of the effects on other life cycle traits is tedious but useful when developing a model that simulates the entire life cycle of an egg carrying copepod dur et al 2013 fortunately multiple egg carriers can be maintained in the lab and followed individually through a well developed protocol with such data we may be able to develop a model that permits stage structure prediction of species in the field which would then allow us to extrapolate the effect to the community level focusing on the small copepod p nana offers several advantages because its entire genome has been sequenced han et al 2015 ki et al 2009 lee et al 2015a and significant information from the molecular to the population level has been published recently byeon et al 2020 dayras et al 2020

24675,solar ultraviolet uv radiation and uv b 280 320 nm in particular has been shown to be partially responsible for adverse effects on zooplankton throughout the world from damaged dna to altered population dynamics to cope with these effects copepods have developed several protective systems including avoiding extended and intense periods of exposure how much uv b exposure a cohort of thousands of spawners can withstand remains unknown to evaluate the post exposure effects of uv b radiation on reproduction in egg carrying copepods we developed an individual based model ibm that integrates in vivo data we calibrated the ibm for a small cyclopoid copepod species paracyclopina nana which is a biological model used in both ecotoxicology and aquaculture our findings improve our understanding of the species response to uv b radiation significant radiative effects include decreased reproductive success at 0 7 kj m 2 and offspring production at 0 6 kj m 2 the model predicted fewer than 500 females from an original cohort of 1000 would survive for five days after exposure to 1 kj m2 and 50 offspring suppression eight days after exposure to 1 kj m 2 this integrative model highlighted the importance of female longevity in maintaining a viable population at doses below 2 kj m 2 and that of hatching success for radiation levels exceeding 2 kj m 2 p nana appeared to be a sensitive species at 25 c but improvements in the model such as incorporation of temperature variation effects and recovery mechanisms should provide better estimates of the species sensitivity to uv b graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords individual based model simulation uv b effect emergence population endpoints 1 introduction compared with chemical pollution ultraviolet uv exposure covers a wider area is more regular in time and the source is beyond an organism s control global warming has led to a decrease in the extent and duration of ice and snow cover on oceans and inland waters as a result underwater environments in polar and alpine regions are now exposed to greater levels of uv radiation clark et al 2013 frey et al 2011 häder et al 2015 uv radiation is also expected to increase in tropical zones in the 21st century due to diminishing cloud cover and stratospheric ozone bais et al 2011 a risk assessment tool that can quantify how much uv radiation aquatic populations can withstand is therefore topical and relevant uv radiation is associated with positive and negative effects on aquatic organisms häder et al 2015 williamson et al 2014 the life essential provitamin d produced by phytoplankton and zooplankton has provided protection from uv radiation for millions of years holick 2003 1989 in fish uv plays a consequential role in feeding and mate selection leech and johnsen 2003 seehausen et al 2008 short term exposure to uv radiation increases resistance to parasites in daphnia overholt et al 2012 however sub lethal doses can cause protein and dna damage kim et al 2011 puthumana et al 2017 rhee et al 2012 impair reproduction won et al 2014 weaken resistance to disease williamson and rose 2010 decrease swimming performance fukunishi et al 2012 alter respiration rates fischer et al 2006 and disrupt population dynamics wang et al 2011 finally despite some degree of tolerance which varies among taxa excessive uv radiation inevitably leads to mortality in zooplankton borgeraas and hessen 2000 hansson and hylander 2009 leech and williamson 2000 this poses two questions how much uv radiation is beneficial and over what threshold does it becomes deleterious for an organism and put entire populations at risk defining the critical tipping point is important as changes in climate and stratospheric ozone concentrations are altering surface uv exposure levels williamson et al 2014 in the aquatic realm copepoda are a dominant if not the largest group constituting a significant portion of the zooplankton community

making it a useful biological model for ecotoxicology the most damaging short wavelength radiation reaching the earth s surface uv b 280 315 nm can penetrate water to depths of approximately 55 m and numerous experiments have established that uv b radiation can have detrimental effects on copepods fukunishi et al 2012 han et al 2016 kim et al 2011 only one study has shown increased survival and reproduction after exposure to uv b but the reason was not identified cooke and williamson 2006 most studies have found uv b radiation exerts harmful effects on different traits in copepods including survival ban et al 2007 lacuna and uye 2000 ma et al 2013 2012 feeding behavior lacuna and uye 2000 ma et al 2012 respiration and excretion ma et al 2013 more recent studies focusing on reproduction won et al 2014 and growth won et al 2015 in p nana have provided high quality uv dose response data uv radiation appears to cause increased mortality and damage in eggs inhibition of hatching and increased expression of antioxidant enzymes won et al 2014 higher production rates of base excision repair associated genes and heat shock protein chaperoning genes were observed in uv irradiated p nana likely leading to deleterious effects on growth and reproduction won et al 2015 copepods have evolved several mechanisms for minimizing their exposure to and protecting themselves from uv radiation including physiological processes and behavioral strategies ban et al 2007 overholt et al 2016 tartarotti et al 2017 for example substances conferring defensive abilities such as mycosporine like amino acid and astaxanthin brüsin et al 2016 hessen 2002 hylander et al 2014 tartarotti et al 2004 2017 have been found in their diet even with such mechanisms long term exposure to uv b can induce post exposure effects but to our knowledge no study has quantified effects on copepods molecular analyses can explain many of the mechanisms enhanced during exposure to uv b at the sub organism level han et al 2016 won et al 2015 2014 nevertheless extrapolating the consequences of these processes to the population scale requires a specific approach establishing a causality link between different biological organization levels is necessary to demonstrate the ecological relevance of molecular and cellular responses and to establish links between a stressor source and responses in vivo e g hanson 2009 several approaches are available to increase our ability to understand emerging processes that act across scales among them the adverse outcome pathway aop ankley et al 2010 and individual based model ibm topping et al 2009 have been proposed the aop approach which is similar to functional modeling souissi et al 2003 is a theoretical framework that provides a structured representation of existing knowledge of action modes at the cellular level in the laboratory and the projection of consequences adverse outcomes at the biological level of organization are more pertinent ecologically ankley et al 2010 lee et al 2015b however the aop approach is conceptual and cannot provide a quantitative extrapolation of the effect of a given stressor at the population scale it is therefore essential to couple this approach with numerical extrapolation gust et al 2016 a combination of an aop approach and a matrix population model allowed coulaud et al 2015 to demonstrate the effect of feeding inhibition on the population dynamics of gammarus models provide simulation tools to quantify and extrapolate the effect of perturbations at the population scale an ibm represents an appropriate approach to integrating the effect of perturbations over several organizational levels forbes et al 2008 preuss et al 2010 by definition ibm integers explicitly serve as links between individuals and populations souissi et al 2003 ibms also have the capacity to combine stochasticity and individual variability both of which play important roles in population dynamics and stability under unfavorable conditions bi and liu 2017 consequently ibms are being used to extrapolate individual level scenarios generated in the laboratory to realistic conditions at the population level in ecological risk assessments beaudouin et al 2015 forbes et al 2011 gabsi et al 2014 kulkarni et al 2014 preuss et al 2010 most ibms for copepods have been developed to study multiple pollution stresses korsman et al 2014 kulkarni et al 2014 but have quantified the effects of uv b in this study we examined the effects of uv b radiation on reproduction in a cohort composed by females using an ibm developed on the mobidyc platform ginot et al 2002 to simulate the reproductive cycle of an egg bearing copepods dur et al 2009 the model description follows the overview design concepts and details protocol proposed by grimm et al 2006 2010 2020 model calibration used experimental results from studies of the effect of uv b radiation on p nana won et al 2015 2014 and from experience accumulated studying this species for several years unpublished data on the reproductive cycle collected by j s lee s laboratory team following the calibration the ibm was used to investigate the post exposure effect of uv b on reproductive traits and success at the scale of a cohort of 1000 females 2 material and methods 2 1 purpose and patterns the model s higher level purpose was to predict the impact of uv b negative outcomes on the recruitment of egg carrying copepods more specifically the model was designed to quantify the post exposure effect of uv b radiation on reproductive traits and success in a copepod cohort of 1000 individuals the model was calibrated for the copepod p nana based on laboratory observations won et al 2014 2015 we evaluated our model by its ability to reproduce two patterns at the individual level a decrease in mortality and fecundity of females with increasing dose of uv b radiation at the cohort level an overall decrease in egg and offspring production by a group of females in response to a higher dose of uv b radiation 2 2 entities state variables and scales spatial scale the model was not spatially explicit the agents were not located in geometrical space temporal scale the simulation ran with a time step fixed at three hours and lasted 25 days which is the maximum lifespan of a p nana female at 25 c unpublished data entities the model included two kinds of entity predefined in mobidyc located agents and non located agents ginot et al 2002 the two located agents represented 1 a p nana individual of the adult female stage and 2 an individual of the first naupliar stage as p nana is an egg carrier reproduction is relatively complex and involves a multi phase cycle dur et al 2009 adult females of p nana have been credited with several state variables called attributes in mobidyc table 1 the nauplii are represented in the model only to evaluate the effect of uv b on hatching success the nauplii of a clutch hatch synchronously and die at the second time step following the hatching after being counted the state variable of the nauplii is therefore age only the non located agents of mobidyc were used to design the model and collect required data from the simulation ginot et al 2002 the three first non located agents were used to store global variables reducing the number of attributes carried by the located agents table 2 paramdev contained the parameter values of the normal distribution used to introduce individual variability on female s life span paramsur reflected the survival probability of the females and how it varied following exposure to a given dose of uv b radiation paramrepro stored all parameters of the normal distribution used to introduce individual variability on the clutch size cs embryonic development time edt and latency time lt paramrepro also stored the value of hatching success hs which varied with the uv b dose received by the female and the post exposure time two additional non located agents were used to represent the environment and the experimenter the environment agent envi referred to the overall environment including the post exposure time matching the simulation time temperature fixed at 25 c and the uv b dose received by the females the experimenter agent scientist recorded the age of the female at time of death and the number of eggs and nauplii produced throughout the simulation 2 3 process overview and scheduling 2 3 1 summary 1 the non located agent envi executes its growolder submodel with increments for its state variable time of three hours 2 the non located agent paramrepro executes its effectuvhs submodel which computes the value of hs in relation to the uv b dose and envi time 3 the non located agent paramsurv executes its effectuvsurv submodel which calculates the survival probability of the adult females psurvadf in relation to post exposure time 4 the adult female agents each execute different tasks simulating the reproductive cycle a schematic representation of the reproductive cycle and the flowchart of the submodel scheduling are provided in figs 1 and 2 respectively in dur et al 2009 the located female agents execute their submodels in the following order a survive which defines whether they will live or die during the time step b defimptime which defines the longevity of the female when the female s age is 0 and the latencytime to produce the subsequent clutch every time the female is non ovigerous and has a latence of 0 c timecumul which increases the female age latence and devembryo by one time step i e three hours d eggproduct which sets the ovigerous status to 1 calculates a new value of clutchsize and embryodt and resets the value of latence and devembryo when the proper conditions for spawning are met cf submodel section e reproduce which creates nauplius 1 agents and resets to zero the attributes ovigerous devembryo latence and clutchsize f die which kills the individual when age exceeds longevity 5 the naupliar 1 agents only survive until counted 2 3 2 rationale the envi is scheduled first because the subsequent paramsurv action depends on the time step in the female agent the submodel defimptime occurs before timecumul to allow the computation of the required latencytime just after the hatching process i e reproduction and the latencytime of the first clutch eggproduct has to occur before reproduction to allow the proper condition and timing for hatching finally scientist actions take place at the end of the time step 2 4 design concepts basic principles our model simulates the consequence of intermittent exposure to uv b radiation on a cohort of females we hypothesized that after exposure the simulated females would avoid uv b radiation by migrating deeper into the water column lampert 1989 ohman and romagnan 2016 alternatively the simulation can also represent the case of intertidal copepod females that escaped with the flood from a tide pool where they could not avoid uv b radiation martin et al 2000 the simulation followed the cohort of females after they escaped and therefore these females did not receive more radiation during the simulation in this model the uv b dose received before escaping affected the survival rate of the females and the hatching success of the eggs to determine the effects we used empirical relationships see submodel below another set of hypotheses concerned the relationship between uv b dose and hs see submodel below the experimental results described a relationship between uv b dose and the percentage of individuals with damaged eggs won et al 2014 all damaged eggs were considered non viable and the non damaged eggs were all viable emergence the key outcomes of the model were the distribution of reproductive traits at the individual scale female longevity clutch number brood size daily egg production dep fecundity total offspring production and cumulated production of eggs and offspring by a female cohort among those results all emerged from the effect of uv b dose on survival rates and the hatching success with the exception of female longevity this outcome was more a direct product of the effect of uv b dose on female survival rate adaptation adaptation was not implemented in the model objectives objectives measurements were not implemented in the model learning learning was not implemented in the model prediction the model included no prediction process fitness individual fitness was determined by female survival rate longevity cs lt edt and hs although the consequences of variations in fitness at higher levels can be quantified the present study did not address this question sensing the state variable ovigerous defined the proper time to perform appropriate reproductive tasks e g spawning and hatching post exposure time pet was also measured as cs and hs values were related to pet interactions interactions between individuals were not introduced in the present model we assumed that the mating was implicitly included in latency time neither the limitations due to mating nor the failure of egg fertilization was considered here stochasticity survival was interpreted as a random variable a survival rate of 95 means an individual will die only if the generated random number belonging to a uniform probability density between 0 1 is larger than 0 95 stochasticity was used to assign each female a life span see the submodel section lt edt and cs are also stochastic as their values were drawn randomly from predefined distributions see the submodel section after the hatching process for lt and the spawning process for edt and cs of each clutch produced collectives the model included no collectives observation an additional non located agent scientist a saved the value of cs and age of death of the female and b counts the number of nauplii produced and extracts them from the simulation this procedure allowed total egg and offspring production to be recorded but also investigated the distribution of different reproductive traits see emergence 2 5 initialization at initialization the female cohort consisted of 1000 newly molted adult females i e age 0 this number of individuals was selected after visualization of the stabilization of the mean and variability of the output variables supplementary materials figure s1 at the beginning of the simulation we assumed that the females had received a dose of uv b radiation before migrating away from the stress the beginning of the simulation marked the beginning of the post exposure time twenty one uv b conditions were tested with doses ranging between 0 and 10 kj m 2 for each condition the simulated experiments were repeated 15 times 15 replicates to consider the output variability produced by the same set of parameters and initial conditions supplementary materials figure s2 2 6 input the temperature was fixed at 25 c similar to the experimental conditions of won et al 2014 the model did not use input data to represent time varying processes 2 7 submodels 2 7 1 reproductive cycle of a female to simulate the reproductive cycle of the females we adapted a model developed by dur et al 2009 with slight modification to the case of p nana unlike the dur et al 2009 model individual variability was not represented by a gamma distribution but a gaussian distribution we therefore modified the tasks defimptime and eggproduct table 3 presents the different tasks used to simulate the reproductive cycle of p nana and their respective pseudocodes for the rationales behind these tasks see dur et al 2009 2 7 2 effect of uv b on the copepod to study the effect of uv b on p nana we used the results from the experiment conducted by won et al 2014 on the effect of uv b radiation on in vivo end points for reproductive success details on the experimental procedures and data used for calibration are presented in supplementary materials text s1 and table s1 and s2 2 7 3 effect on female survival won et al 2014 found that the survival of females exposed to different doses of uv b radiation decreased with dose and post exposure time to parameterize this double effect we first investigated the relationship between the survival and the post exposure time for each uv b dose a gaussian formula satisfactorily represented the relationship between those two parameters for each dose 1 s a e t c 2 where s represents the survival rate and t the elapsed time following irradiation in hours supplementary material table s3 provides the results of those fits we then examined for the relationship between uv b dose and the parameters a c of eq 1 the relation between uv b dose and a was well fitted with a third order polynomial regression fig 1 a a power law expressed c in relation to uv b dose fig 1 b 2 7 4 effect on hatching success to measure dysfunction in hatching won et al 2014 counted the number of dropped egg clutches effects of uv radiation were only observed for uv b doses greater than 2 kj m 2 the number of dropped eggs increased with radiation dose and post exposure time using these results we examined the effect of uv b exposure and post radiation time on hs by applying the following hypothesis 1 all damaged eggs were non viable and 2 non damaged eggs were viable we then defined hs as 100 percentage of damaged eggs as observed by won et al 2014 for survival we graphically examined the relationship between hatching success and post radiation time the measured skewness of the relationship fig 2 a led us to apply the inverse of a gamma function to model hs as a function of pet 2 h s d c g a m c d f t α β where t is the post exposure time in hours and α and β represent the respective shape and scale parameters of the gamma function we then investigated the relationship between the parameters of eq 2 and uv b dose the α and β parameters of the gamma function exhibited neither clear variation in function of uv b dose nor strong variability among the different conditions of radiation coefficient of variation 0 43 we therefore chose to keep the values of the α and β parameters constant at 2 759 and 6 291 respectively once the gamma distribution parameters were fixed the other parameters of eq 2 c and d exhibited clearer relationships with increasing uv b doses we used an exponential function to represent the relationship between eq 2 c and radiation dose fig 2 b and modeled eq 2 d as a function of uv b radiation with a linear function fig 2 c integrating these two models in eq 2 we simulated the hs value as a function of the uv b dose and pet fig 2 d 3 results 3 1 effect of uv b on individual end points the numerical outputs provided a dynamical explanation for the effect of uv radiation on the total production of p nana fig 3 as implemented in the model female longevity was strongly affected by radiation dose from 12 days to 1 day of average longevity for no radiation and following a 10 kj m 2 radiation respectively individual variability in longevity decreased with increasing uv radiation consequently the number of clutches a female could produce in its life followed a similar trend for both average values and individual variability nevertheless variability in the number of clutches stabilized at 0 45 clutch per females at radiation doses greater than 4 kj m 2 contrary to the results for female longevity and the number of clutches brood size displayed a different relationship with increasing uv radiation while the average brood size remained constant i e 13 6 eggs clutch despite increasing radiation doses the variability of brood size increased rapidly with increasing radiation dose until reaching a plateau with approximately 3 7 eggs clutch at 0 kj m 2 the standard deviation doubled at 4 kj m 2 as a result daily egg production dep exhibited a similar pattern the average number of eggs produced per day per female was constant at 6 9 but variability increased with radiation the standard deviation in dep for no radiation was approximately 1 9 eggs day female and reached 7 8 eggs day female at 10 kj m 2 of radiation the resulting response in average total number of eggs produced by a female over its life fecundity followed a trend similar to that of female longevity average fecundity decreased rapidly with radiation and after a 7 kj m 2 dose of radiation fecundity fell by 87 and continued decreasing as radiation exposure rose supplementary material figure s3 the fecundity variability diminished with increasing radiation dose up to 5 kj m 2 beyond this dose fecundity remained relatively constant as a result of decreasing variability in female lifespan and increasing variability in cs the effect of radiation on hs has consequences for the next generation production the response in total number of offspring to increasing radiation followed a trend similar to that of fecundity but the decrease was faster and stronger after exposure to 6 kj m 2 no offspring hatched compared with an average of nine eggs produced for the same condition supplementary material figure s3 analysis of the distribution of parameter values confirmed the previously observed effect of radiation on variability fig 4 and the strong importance of female longevity for the control condition no radiation all parameters exhibited a normal distribution for all parameters besides brood size and dep the distributions shifted toward zero with increasing uv b dose and became increasingly narrower the span of total offspring distribution shrank much faster than that of fecundity with increasing radiation dose meanwhile brood size distributions flattened out the dep distribution center slid slightly toward the lower class with a tail toward higher classes 3 2 uv b effect on cohort end points at the cohort level the model revealed the importance of female longevity on production at doses below 2 kj m 2 and that of hatching success at doses greater than 2 kj m 2 fig 5 the number of reproductive cycles the peaks in fig 5 top graphs rapidly decreased with increasing radiation females exposed to 8 kj m 2 could still produce one clutch the effect of female longevity was important at low radiation doses and decreased slightly with increasing radiation dose the difference in cumulative egg production between two radiations doses decreased with increasing dose a 0 5 kj m 2 dose of radiation led to a 40 loss in cumulated egg production between 0 5 and 1 kj m 2 the cumulative egg production exhibited a 20 decrease between 1 and 2 kj m 2 a 14 decrease and between 2 and 4 kj m 2 a 9 5 loss similar decreases were observed for the cumulative offspring production below 1 kj m 2 at 2 kj m 2 the effect of hatching success became dominant leading to dramatic effects between 1 and 2 kj m 2 total offspring production suffered a loss of 21 after irradiation of 8 kj m 2 no nauplii were produced 4 discussion the effects of uv radiation on aquatic invertebrates have been of great concern for the last two decades dahms and lee 2010 häder et al 2007 hylander et al 2015 hylander and hansson 2013 rautio and tartarotti 2010 the present study represents a preliminary step toward a risk assessment of the effects of uv b radiation on copepods here we focused on the effects on reproduction by first defining dose response relationships based on the results of laboratory experiments won et al 2015 2014 on female survival and hatching success we then applied those relationships to an ibm representing the reproductive cycle of egg carrying copepods dur et al 2009 the present study also demonstrated the benefits of a close collaboration between modelers and experimentalists as previously advocated koch et al 2017 zaccaria et al 2017 the results of this collaboration led to a model that enhances our ability to quantify the consequences of uv b radiation at the population level 4 1 from subcellular to population levels adverse outcome pathways facilitate the effective integration of diverse information acquired at different levels our current work expands on that of won et al 2015 2014 and allows us to enrich the aop on the responses to uv b radiation with additional information at a level beyond that of the organism fig 6 won et al 2014 reported the effects of uv b radiation at three levels at the molecular level uv b radiation modulated fatty acid composition and peroxidation of lipids this in turn activated an antioxidant mechanism that thwarts cellular necrosis or apoptosis while the response at the organ level remains unknown won et al 2014 also provided information on responses at the organism level including a reduction in egg production and hatching success and an increase in mortality combined these effects should affect the entire population the present study revealed 1 a strong decline in fecundity and offspring production 2 increased variability in brood size and daily egg production 3 declining population while most consequences were expected the present model allowed the quantification of those population level effects similar studies see topping et al 2009 have endorsed ibms as useful tools to predict and quantify responses at the population scale using data collected at the individual scale and consequently realized ecological risks assessment forbes et al 2019 2017 the effects of a toxicant on an organism are multidimensional and involve different life traits ibms such as the one presented here allow us to integrate this multidimensionality and can be used to systematically explore system resilience egli et al 2019 the current version of the presented model is not elaborated well enough to allow such a risk evaluation to be operational the model would need to consider the effect of temperature and the different responses at all life stages see toward environmental risk assessment below however our model does provide important information particularly about the sensitivity of the selected species 4 2 sensitivity of p nana the developed model combined the effects of uv b radiation on different aspects of the reproduction in an egg carrying copepod the cumulative effect can dramatically influence population maintenance and manifest itself at low exposure doses in the present study we found that even a subtly low dose of uv b radiation affects female survival and hs and could yield strong changes in population fecundity and fertility of a group of 1000 females was halved at 25 days after exposure to 0 7 and 0 6 kj m 2 of radiation respectively yet the median lethal dose ld50 of uv b radiation for p nana and other copepod species is more than 10 fold higher the ld50 of p nana is 21 2

results emphasize the potential negative effects of stressors on a population even at sub lethal doses the results of our simulations also draw attention to the overall high sensitivity of p nana populations to uv b radiation p nana is sensitive to a variety of environmental and xenobiotic stressors dayras et al 2020 han et al 2015 hwang et al 2010 lee et al 2006 rhee et al 2012 won and lee 2014 zhou et al 2019 making it a useful indicator of environmental stress dahms et al 2016 in the peculiar case of uv radiation the species vulnerability is associated with a potential lack or low levels of photoprotective pigments such as astaxanthin and melanin unpigmented copepods are reportedly more sensitive to uv radiation compared with pigmented species byron 1982 ringelberg et al 1984 while observations of p nana have revealed a non colorful copepod a detailed analysis of the species photoprotective pigment concentration is needed to confirm this hypothesis and life stage differences in carotenoid content should also be taken into account lotocka et al 2004 the effect of uv b on reproductive success in p nana is unambiguous we identified a dramatic decrease in the production of eggs and the number of offspring this supports reports by karanas et al 1981 naganuma et al 1997 puthumana et al 2017 williamson et al 1994 and yu et al 2009 rodriguez et al 2000 reported a two fold decrease in egg production and naupliar deformities in calanus finmarchicus exposed to 145 175 kj m 2 of radiation however c finmarchicus hatching success was affected mainly by uv a rather than uv b rodriguez et al 2000 our results also revealed that exposure to uv b aggravates a decline in egg production throughout the life span of adult females this contradicts the finding of heine et al 2019 who reported no effect of uv radiation on the number of clutches produced per females in tigriopus californicus this discrepancy can be explained by the difference in dose level which was moderate in the heine et al 2019 experiments but also by the characteristics of t californicus which reportedly exhibits exceptional resistance to environmental stressors raisuddin et al 2007 rhee et al 2009 and antioxidant enzyme gpx and gr activities that protect against uv induced oxidative damage are likely high as observed in its congener kim et al 2015 t californicus lives in shallow pounds where uv radiation penetration is high making the ability to withstand such conditions and to cope with reactive oxygen a matter of survival however p nana is a planktonic cyclopoid copepod found in brackish waters and the population used by won et al 2015 2014 is from a brackish waterbody lake songji the degree of uv penetration in such a turbid environment is expected to be far lower than in a tidal pool considering the effect of suspended organic matter on uv b penetration boelen et al 1999 tedetti and sempere 2006 as a result strong protective mechanisms against uv were not selected in this population of p nana finally our results provide compelling evidence that individual variability in brood size increases with radiation dose they support previous work showing a greater degree of individual variability in the population under unfavorable conditions pfister and stevens 2002 warwick and clarke 1993 increased variability is considered indicative of approaching a tipping point or regime shift carpenter and brock 2006 hewitt and thrush 2010 scheffer et al 2009 however one set of studies showed that increases in individual variability in physiological traits are important for population resilience to environmental stress bi and liu 2017 richmond et al 2013 and for a population s ability to invade a new ecosystem goldwasser et al 1994 in our case the increase in brood size variability was associated with a decrease in cumulative nauplii production and an increase in variability in such production until it was null supplementary material figure s 4 however the observed increase in brood size variability may have been a consequence of the limited number of observations too few females which could have affected the distribution supplementary material figure s 5 it is therefore important to identify the source of such variation in individual variability in our case it is clear that the decreasing number of females due to the effect of uv radiation on mortality led to increased variability in brood size this was the result of stochasticity that only a model based on multi agent systems can integrate an ibm can integrate any other source of variability e g genetic and or plasticity if the relationship is proven or demonstrated experimentally further studies with the present model should test how increased variability at the individual scale can influence population recruitment 4 3 toward environmental risk assessments while the present model offers detailed process analysis and the ability to extrapolate results from the lab several points remain to be addressed before the model can be applied to environmental risk assessments temperature is the first influencing factor that needs to be considered in future versions of the model in the present study all runs were conducted at a constant temperature 25 c however because temperature affects the ability of the photo enzymatic repair per light repair mechanism for uv b induced dna damage in copepods gonçalves et al 2002 williamson et al 2002 it should be possible to integrate the effects of variable temperatures in an ibm i e dur et al 2013 the next step would be parameterization of the interaction between temperature and uv radiation which can first be designed theoretically based on literature the most frequently observed response in zooplankton is more efficient repair at higher temperatures macfadyen et al 2004 williamson et al 2002 controversial results from a study of enhanced per connelly et al 2009 and reduced phototoxic effects of uv radiation kumar et al 2015 at lower temperatures highlight the need to consider species specific responses for parameterization it is therefore appropriate to determine the relationships for a given species experimentally the current model can be used as a tool to provide feedback on future experiments with p nana consideration of temperature is also essential because copepods have developed behavioral strategies to avoid uv radiation that include migration toward deeper layers where temperatures are lower and this involves a correlated increase or decrease in phototoxic effects as well as a decrease in production leech et al 2009 an important point raised by gabsi et al 2014 is the fact that the effect on the f1 generation can control a population even more than survival can this must be taken into account to explain the effect of any xenobiotic factors at the population scale copepods accumulate photoprotective compounds such as astaxanthin by ingesting food tartarotti et al 2017 which provides protection against uv radiation hairston 1976 sommaruga 2010 concentrations of astaxanthin in copepods vary by population i e 0 4 1 8 µg mg dry weight for a cyclopoid copepod in the austrian alpine lakes tartarotti et al 2017 life stage lotocka et al 2004 and habitat properties tartarotti et al 2017 astaxanthin concentration appears to be a heritable trait in copepods gorokhova et al 2013 lotocka et al 2004 in the present ibm this could be implemented as the quantity of astaxanthin contained in each individual required to impart greater resistance to uv and that could be transmitted to progeny to allow them to stay in warmer surface waters where they experience higher reproductive output some toxicants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs exhibit increased toxicity after exposure to uv radiation this phototoxicity can have lethal consequences for aquatic organisms ankley et al 1995 bowling et al 1983 hatlen et al 2010 oris and giesy 1985 pelletier et al 1997 modeling approaches have been used to assess the risk of pah phototoxicity to fish ankley et al 1997 sellin jeffries et al 2013 similarly our model can integrate information on pah transfer from the water column to copepods cailleaud et al 2007 and estimate the risk posed by pah toxicity to egg carrying copepods several recent studies have investigated the in vivo effect of metals and emerging contaminants on p nana these include the effect of microplastics on molecular responses jeong et al 2017 the bioaccumulation and toxicity of metal cocktails dayras et al 2020 and the biotransformation and detoxification process of arsenic byeon et al 2020 the knowledge acquired through these studies at different levels from subcellular to population level is a useful asset as some ibms in the present study integrated the effect of those contaminants but a model that combines the effect of contaminants and uv radiation requires additional data about the cumulative or synergistic impact in other words a modeling approach can help define the specific experimental design that provides adequate data for calibration ibms applied to amenable species can produce population relevant data that are of the highest value to environmental risk assessments as regulations are almost always written to protect populations despite their evident efficiency the use of ibms for such assessments is rare forbes et al 2019 the main downside is the lack of data for model calibration and verification our results while encouraging should be validated through experiments conducted at the population scale or in a mesocosm our study also provides a framework for the future development of a model to assess the effects on an entire life cycle this will allow us to take into consideration entire post embryonic development as well as ontogenic sensitivity to uv radiation yu et al 2009 following conclusive tests and an thorough validation our model could be used to predict the effects of uv radiation at the population scale bringing us a step closer to an effective environmental risk assessment tool 5 conclusion the present study brought quantitative insights to our understanding of p nana reproduction dynamics following exposure to uv b radiation the model can be generalized to other egg carrying species our results shed light on the population level effects of uv radiation on sexually reproducing crustaceans in general the model can also be extended to the entire life cycle an ibm approach should help overcome difficulties acquiring appropriate data for calibration measurement of the effects on other life cycle traits is tedious but useful when developing a model that simulates the entire life cycle of an egg carrying copepod dur et al 2013 fortunately multiple egg carriers can be maintained in the lab and followed individually through a well developed protocol with such data we may be able to develop a model that permits stage structure prediction of species in the field which would then allow us to extrapolate the effect to the community level focusing on the small copepod p nana offers several advantages because its entire genome has been sequenced han et al 2015 ki et al 2009 lee et al 2015a and significant information from the molecular to the population level has been published recently byeon et al 2020 dayras et al 2020

24676,energy is fundamentally important to life and when energy supplies cannot support energy demands animals may reduce energy deficits through behavioral compensation a phenomenon that can vary with physiological state state dependent or environmental conditions context dependent we built an energetics model to estimate seasonal and annual energy expenditures by female sierra nevada bighorn sheep ovis canadensis sierrae hereafter sierra bighorn and evaluated whether energy expenditures by sierra bighorn were consistent with behavioral compensation we parameterized the model with values from the literature for energy expenditures for metabolism feeding locomotion tissue synthesis and reproduction in bighorn sheep and populated the model with empirical data body mass ingesta free body

reproductive females 5 066 mj yr 1 regardless of reproductive state female sierra bighorn expended less energy on activity in winter compared with summer which was consistent with context dependent environmental behavioral compensation results for state dependent behavioral compensation were ambiguous but daily movements and associated energy expenditures decreased over winter coincident with declines in body fat our energy model can be adapted to any free ranging ungulate if annual body mass and fat dynamics metabolic rates reproductive state and daily movements are known coupling our

may migrate albon and langvatn 1992 avgar et al 2014 sawyer et al 2018 whereas others incorporate some combination of fat accumulation seasonal torpor and migration ruminant animals store fat and migrate but they cannot hibernate because regular feeding is required to maintain a diverse community of microbes in the rumen that largely are responsible for digestion meiske et al 1958 potter and

and when surplus food supplies can be converted to body fat chappel and hudson 1980 lawler and white 2003 mautz 1978 silver et al 1969 behavioral adaptations in addition to physiological adaptations

understand how energy influences behavior of sierra nevada bighorn sheep o c sierrae hereafter sierra bighorn we developed a bioenergetic model that estimated annual and seasonal energy expenditures by sierra bighorn from estimates of energy requirements for metabolic rates feeding locomotion tissue synthesis i e replenishment of muscle and body fat and reproduction with data on body mass body fat and movements of sierra bighorn we hypothesized that energy expenditures by sierra bighorn would be context dependent occurring in some seasons but not others and state dependent varying relative to reproductive and nutritional state if energy expenditures by sierra bighorn were context dependent we predicted that energy expenditures for activity would be lowest in winter when energy supplies are most scarce in the environment and highest in summer when energy supplies are most abundant in the environment if energy expenditures by sierra bighorn were state dependent relative to reproductive state we predicted that reproductive females would expend less energy on activity than non reproductive females if energy expenditures by sierra bighorn were state dependent relative to nutritional state we predicted that 1 daily activity and associated energy expenditures during winter would be a function of autumn levels of body fat and 2 activity and associated energy expenditures would decrease as winter progressed and body fat stores were depleted 2 material and methods 2 1 study system and life history of sierra bighorn sierra bighorn occupy much of the sierra nevada between olancha peak and mount warren areas characterized by open xeric vegetation communities great basin sagebrush bitterbrush scrub communities occur at low elevations 1 500 2 500 m pinyon juniper woodlands subalpine meadows and subalpine forests occur at moderate elevations 2 500 3 300 m and a mix of sparsely vegetated areas and alpine meadows occur at high elevations 3 300 m spitz et al 2020 climate in the sierra nevada is highly seasonal and characterized by dry summers may september most precipitation falls as snow during winter but high winds keep some alpine ridges free of snow throughout winter november april spitz et al 2020 seasonal precipitation and temperatures vary across elevational gradients and influence forage productivity greene et al 2012 wehausen 1980 which also can be limited by nitrogen phosphorous or sulfur evans and neal 1982 composition of diets of sierra bighorn varies with seasonal changes in forage quality and availability but consists of graminoids forbs and shrubs throughout the year greene et al 2012 wehausen 1980 some sierra bighorn migrate to lower elevations 1 500 2 700 m during winter where green up occurs earliest spitz et al 2020 wehausen 1980 other sierra bighorn may remain at higher elevations 3 000 m year round spitz et al 2020 like other north temperate ungulates sierra bighorn accumulate stores of body fat during summer that can be mobilized during winter monteith et al 2018 stephenson et al 2020 to support energy demands for survival and reproduction when food resources are relatively limited female sierra bighorn typically produce one lamb per year after two years of age n 168 211 but some yearlings n 6 16 also reproduce reproductive pauses may occur up to 20 of the time in females 2 years old n 43 211 unpublished data costs of reproduction are expected to be relatively high to mothers attempting to rear a lamb during a relatively short growing season festa bianchet and jorgenson 1998 females that lactated had an average of 6 1 percentage points less body fat in autumn than those that did not lactate stephenson et al 2020 2 2 animal capture and handling we used empirical data from sierra bighorn that were captured in october of 2009 and 2012 johnson et al 2013 and fitted with global positioning system gps collars manufactured by lotek wireless inc lotek 8000 series newmarket ontario canada and followit ab formerly televilt international tellus iridium model lindesberg sweden programmed to collect 20 or 24 gps locations per day to estimate percent ingesta free body fat hereafter body fat during handling we measured thickness of subcutaneous rump fat and assigned a palpation score using standardized protocols stephenson et al 2020 we weighed animals using a hanging scale mounted on a tripod reproductive status was determined by the presence of a lamb at heel during surveys the summer following the autumn in which sierra bighorn were captured 2 3 calculating daily body mass and body fat change body mass and body fat levels at autumn captures were assumed to represent maximum levels for each individual for that year using data on reproductive and non reproductive female sierra bighorn captured in back to back autumn and spring captures n 12 unpublished data these recaptured individuals were not the same individuals used in this energetics study we estimated state dependent changes in kg of body fat over winter cook et al 2013 monteith et al 2013 for sierra bighorn using linear regression eq 1 1 δ b f win 0 7583 b f aut 2 1812 where δbfwin is the total overwinter change in body fat in kg bfaut is autumn body fat measured as a percentage of body mass at capture and converted to kg we assumed body fat change represented 90 of overwinter mass change and that the remaining 10 of change was due to changes in lean body mass boertje 1985 we divided total body mass and body fat changes through winter by the number of days over which we assumed these changes occurred 176 days nov 20 may 14 julian days 324 134 and then decremented body mass and body fat by these values each day through may 14 fig 1 from parturition may 15 julian day 135 mean and median lambing date forshee 2018 through the first six weeks of lactation 42 days ending jun 25 julian day 176 we assumed reproductive females catabolized remaining fat reserves down to 1 kg 2 of body mass according to eq 2 2 δ b f daylact b f spr 1 42 where δbfdaylact is daily body fat change during lactation kg bfspr is body fat kg on 15 may and 42 is the number of days over which fat loss occurred during early lactation fat losses were decremented daily during the first six weeks of lactation and daily fat losses were subtracted from body mass each day during this period we assumed females that had 1 kg of body fat on 15 may did not rear a lamb we assumed no additional losses of body fat or body mass occurred in non reproductive females after 15 may all animals were assumed to experience a linear gain in body mass and body fat during summer and autumn eq 3 3 δ b f daysum b m aut b m min summer gain days where δbfdaysum is daily change in body mass kg during summer bmmin is an individual s minimum body mass kg 14 may julian day 134 for non reproductive females 25 june julian day 176 for reproductive females for non reproductive females we assumed body mass and fat gain occurred for 163 days beginning on 15 may and ending on 25 october julian day 298 approximate capture date that represented the day of maximum body fat and mass our model reproductive females were assumed to be unable to gain body mass or fat until the 43rd day post partum 26 june julian day 177 when energy expenditures for lactation dropped below peak levels and continued gaining until 25 october 121 days of gain fig 1 fat changes were calculated by substituting bfaut and bfmin individual s minimum body fat in kg either on 14 may julian day 134 for non reproductive females or 25 june julian day 176 for reproductive females for bmaut and bmmin in eq 3 2 4 calculating annual energy budgets we compiled estimates of energy expenditures on life processes by bighorn sheep available in primary literature to build a bioenergetic model for bighorn sheep table 1 resting metabolic rate rmr mj day 1 was the foundation of our model for bighorn sheep because rmr reflects the rate of energy use required to maintain basic physiological functions when animals are at rest robbins 1993 we calculated daily rmr rmrday according to eq 4 an adaptation of an equation presented by chappel and hudson 1980 4 rm r day mrmr f e m a l e f state b m day seas where mrmr is the mean rmr of bighorn sheep 11 012 mj day 1 to which adjustments for sex female 0 49 mj day 1 for females fasted state

defined seasons metabolically based on seasonal changes in metabolic rates reported by chappel and hudson 1980 table 1 and hence we defined autumn as sep oct coefficient 0 390 mj day 1 winter as nov feb coefficient 1 048 mj day 1 spring as mar apr coefficient 1 004 mj day 1 and summer as may aug coefficient 3 618 mj day 1 chappel and hudson 1980 did not report metabolic rates for jul aug but we assumed nutritional requirements remained elevated for reproduction and tissue synthesis in jul aug and hence we used the may jun adjustment to mean rmr for these months season also included adjustments for level of nutrient intake coefficients sep oct 0 224 mj day 1 nov feb 0 535 mj day 1 mar apr 0 846 mj day 1 and may aug 0 936 mj day 1 table 1 we also adjusted for seasonal exposure temperature using mean of monthly average high and low temperatures for mammoth lakes ca by season which we retrieved from https www usclimatedata com climate mammoth lakes california united states usca1448 2018 1 mean temperatures were 9 3 c in autumn sep oct coefficient 0 377 mj day 1 2 6 c in winter nov feb coefficient 0 121 mj day 1 1 8 c in spring mar apr coefficient 0 121 mj day 1 and 13 3 c in summer may aug coefficient 0 377 mj day 1 the adjustment for fasting state did not account for the heat increment of feeding fh which we adjusted using eq 5 chappel and hudson 1979 5 f h 0 0018 bm f t where 0 0018 kj kg 1 h 1 is a constant bm is body mass kg and ft is feeding time h during jan may female sierra bighorn spent 43 of their time feeding schroeder et al 2010 or 10 3 h day 1 which we used as winter and spring foraging times in our model for summer and autumn where activity observations were not available for sierra bighorn we used average values for feeding time for other populations of bighorn and thinhorn ovis dalli spp sheep in north america during summer female ovis spp fed for an average of 13 h day 1 ruckstuhl 1998 seip and bunnell 1985 walker et al 2006 feeding time of female rocky mountain bighorn sheep averaged 10 6 h day 1 during autumn ruckstuhl 1998 we assumed that during summer and autumn when sheep have elevated energy requirements for lactation and rearing of young nonreproductive female ungulates foraged 2 h less per day than reproductive females denryter et al 2020 hence given average foraging time of 13 h day 1 and 2 h day 1 difference in foraging time between reproductive and non reproductive females we assumed foraging times of 12 h day 1 and 14 h day 1 during summer and 9 6 h day 1 and 11 6 h day 1 during autumn for non reproductive and reproductive females respectively although it would be a better strategy for non reproductive females to increase feeding times to levels of reproductive females digestion by non reproductive females is more physiologically constrained than reproductive females for example the rumen of lactating females increases in capacity and absorptive surface area compared with non lactating females luna and weckerly 2013 zimmerman et al 2006 and lactating females increase forage intake and ruminate faster than non lactating females blanchard 2005 campling 1970 gross et al 1995 k b monteith et al 2014 owen smith 2002 tulloh 1966 consequently among ruminants non reproductive females physiologically cannot eat as much as reproductive females denryter et al 2020 feeding times reflect changes to the heat increment of feeding rather than energy expenditures on feeding activities because we did not have complete activity budgets for sierra bighorn we used expenditures on locomotion as a surrogate for energy expenditures on activity we calculated daily movements in m of gps collared sierra bighorn as the sum of three dimensional euclidean distance between consecutive gps locations jenness 2004 in r r core team 2018 from a digital elevation model 30 m resolution we assigned values for costs of locomotion for moving up and down slopes according to values reported in the literature however these costs were reported only for a subset of slopes dailey and hobbs 1989 halsey and white 2017 lachica and aguilera 2005 table 2 for slopes of 1 to 1 we estimated net cost of locomotion j using eq 6 value for 0 slope in dailey and hobbs 1989 6 net cost of locomotion 4 95 bm dist where 4 95 j kg 1 m 1 is a constant bm is body mass kg and dist is distance m eqs 7 10 follow this form for slopes 1 10 we used the value for 3 5 slope halsey and white 2017 eq 7 7 net cost of locomotion 7 44 bm dist for slopes of 10 1 we used eq 8 value approximated for slopes of 3 5 slope in lachica et al 1997 8 net cost of locomotion 2 0 bm dist for slopes 10 we used eq 9 value for 21 5 slope in dailey and hobbs 1989 and halsey and white 2017 9 net cost of locomotion 21 08 bm dist for slopes of 10 we used eq 10 value for 21 5 slope in dailey and hobbs 1989 10 net cost of locomotion 5 34 bm dist daily movements across each slope class were summed and multiplied by corresponding energy costs for locomotion eqs 6 10 when a gps collar was unable to obtain any locations on a given day we used that individual s daily movement distance from the closest preceding day for which data were available we did not use data from animals missing 30 days of gps locations over a given year we included equations for locomotion through snow table 2 in the model but those did not apply in our study years 2009 2010 and 2012 2013 which were drought years and sierra bighorn wintered in snow free areas to determine energy expenditures on tissue synthesis we determined the quantities in kg of lean mass and fat that were catabolized by bighorn sheep overwinter and converted these values into their energy equivalents 19 2 mj kg 1 for lean mass protein and 39 5 mj kg 1 for fat robbins 1993 we assumed energy was used at 65 efficiency agricultural research council 1980 boertje 1985 hence equations for tissue synthesis were eqs 11 12 11 e m δ bm δ bf 19 2 0 65 12 e f δ bf 39 5 0 65 where em is the energy cost of muscle synthesis ef is the energy cost of fat synthesis and δbm and δbf are the differences in autumn and spring summer levels of body mass and body fat respectively in kg we determined relationships using equations for state dependent loss estimates for additional losses during lactation and assumptions that overwinter changes in ingesta free body fat accounted for 90 of overwinter mass change energy costs of gestation and lactation have not been measured empirically for bighorn sheep so we extrapolated these costs using data from other north temperate ungulates that

and late gestation 3rd trimester added 45 to daily energy requirements over maintenance costs based on calculations of energy requirements for cervids in national research council 2007 table 2 hence daily energetic costs of gestation were calculated according to eq 13 energy costs of gestation 1st and 2nd trimesters eg1 2 and eq 14 energy costs of gestation 3rd trimester eg3 13 e g 1 2 rmr 0 08

back calculated the beginning of gestation as 21 nov julian day 325 beginning 175 days before the median lambing date of 15 may for sierra bighorn forshee 2018 we assumed that all reproductive females

statistical analyses using stata14 statacorp college station tx usa for seasonal and annual totals including for each category of the energy budget i e metabolism activity reproduction tissue synthesis we collapsed data into one observation per individual on collapsed data we used the kruskal wallis test to evaluate whether total energy expenditures differed between reproductive and non reproductive females annually and intra seasonally for analyses that tracked daily expenditures of individuals rather than expenditures collapsed over a year or within a season we used multilevel mixed effects models hereafter multilevel models to account for the hierarchical nature of our data multiple observations per individual we fit multilevel models to energy expenditures with individual modeled as a random intercept the only fixed effect in these models was an intercept we fit separate multilevel models for reproductive and non reproductive females and compared 95 confidence intervals of the intercepts of these models to evaluate whether daily energy expenditures differed by reproductive status or season we also used multilevel models to evaluate whether energy expenditures on activity decreased as winter progressed with individuals modeled using a random intercept fit separately for reproductive and non reproductive females for comparisons of reproductive and non reproductive females wherein we had only one observation per individual body fat at onset of winter we used linear regression we also subsampled gps locations at intervals of 2 h 12 fixes day

discussion behavioral compensation can be an important strategy for individuals to regulate energy balances in environments where energy supplies cannot support energy demands year round and ultimately has implications to survival productivity and fitness we hypothesized that behavioral compensation in sierra bighorn was context dependent and state dependent our work suggests that as in larger bodied ungulates behavioral compensation was context dependent in female sierra bighorn occurring during the greatest nutritional bottleneck of the year winter and into spring results regarding state dependent behavioral compensation were more ambiguous as we did not detect a direct relationship between body fat at the onset of winter and movement or energy expenditures on locomotion during winter nevertheless energy expenditures for locomotion declined over winter concurrent with over winter declines in body fat and body mass providing indirect support for the hypothesis that behavioral compensation was state dependent we also expected state dependence to manifest relative to reproductive state because high costs of lactation may require additional foraging time and associated movement by lactating females denryter et al 2020 nevertheless daily movements and energy expenditures on locomotion were similar between reproductive and non reproductive females during summer collectively our results contrast those for some larger bodied ungulates including elk long et al 2014 and caribou denryter et al 2020 and may hint at allometric differences that constrain decisions about behavioral compensation or the potential for behavioral mediation of allee effects for example body size constrains forage processing van soest 1996 and allee effects that dilute risk of predation stephens and sutherland 1999 increase fitness of individuals gil et al 2018 or rescue populations from ecological traps schmidt et al 2015 may constrain foraging and movement behaviors in bighorn sheep strong selective pressures for group living in bighorn sheep may explain in part why our results were somewhat inconsistent with state dependent behavioral compensation group living dilutes predation risk on any one individual and group vigilance allows individuals in the group to forage more efficiently rieucau and martin 2008 benefits of group living may be rewarding enough to keep animals with lesser nutritional requirements moving with the group or alternatively animals with greater nutritional requirements may forgo some foraging opportunities for safety and foraging efficiency that comes with group living we cannot determine if similarities in movements of reproductive and non reproductive females reflect non reproductive females moving more than they needed to satisfy nutritional requirements reproductive females sacrificing some foraging opportunities or altering foraging behaviors to remain with the group or some combination of these regardless similarities in movements between reproductive and non reproductive females probably reflect strong evolutionary selection for group living chaplin 1982 markham and gesquiere 2017 roverud and chappell 1991 white and warner 2007 more work however is needed to understand implications of group living to energetics in bighorn sheep and how such relationships may scale allometrically among ungulates we also suspect that behavioral compensation may manifest through behaviors that we were unable to measure an energy model that incorporates high temporal resolution activity budgets either from accelerometers or direct observations of activity in addition to movement and accounts for potential influences of group living would provide more refined estimates of energy expenditures karasov 1992 the comparatively lower energy expenditures on activity by sierra bighorn during winter than summer supported the hypothesis that behavioral compensation was context dependent by reducing daily movement distances in winter sierra bighorn saved an average of 0 5 mj per day compared to summer or 6 days of total energy expenditures across the winter season seasonal changes in activity and other behaviors that conserve energy are assumed to be an adaptation to seasonal limitations in supplies of energy and perhaps other nutrients adamczewski et al 1993 lawler and white 2003 moen 1976 parker et al 1999 roby 1979 russell and martell 1986 and hence are a form of behavioral compensation increasing levels of behavioral compensation by sierra bighorn as winter progressed may reflect decreases in foraging profitability resulting from a diminishing gain function as forage quality continues declining through winter until green up begins in spring parker et al 1999 additionally bighorn sheep evolved a strategy of using escape terrain that spatially segregates them from their predators spatial segregation from predators may result in lower frequencies of predator encounters which may allow bighorn sheep to conserve energy by reducing locomotion associated with predator avoidance although north temperate ungulates including sierra bighorn use behavioral and physiological buffers against limited food supplies in winter they generally still lose body fat and mass over winter adamczewski et al 1987 cook et al 2013 mautz 1978 k l monteith et al 2014 stephenson et al 2020 thus behavioral and physiological adaptations cannot completely offset energy deficits that result from limited food supplies or limits to nutrient acquisition differences in seasonal energy expenditures identified in the model may suggest differences in the relative importance of energy supplies on summer versus winter ranges or differences in energetic constraints on each range given that fat gain occurs primarily on summer ranges for north temperate ungulates summer ranges have a key role in determining whether a female can accrete enough fat to successfully breed in autumn or survive through winter adamczewski et al 1993 cook et al 2004 2013 k l monteith et al 2014 parker et al 2009 winter ranges however increase in importance when summer ranges are nutritionally impoverished and cannot support accumulation of large fat reserves by animals monteith et al 2013 schmelzer and otto 2003 we think estimates of energy expenditures by sierra bighorn produced using our model were realistic as expected reproductive females had higher annual energy expenditures than non reproductive females and differences were largely attributable to costs of reproduction calculated using our energetics model our estimates of energy expenditures by sierra bighorn during winter 10 5 mj day 1 for non reproductive females and 10 2 mj day 1 for reproductive females were 29 48 lower than estimates of winter maintenance requirements 14 7 19 7 mj day 1 converted to metabolizable energy for comparison using a factor of 1 22 national research council 2007 derived by goodson et al 1991 for bighorn sheep in colorado we attribute this difference to the estimates of maintenance requirements and energy expenditures on movement locomotion used by goodson et al 1991 maintenance requirements used by goodson et al 1991 were derived from estimates for captive bighorn sheep during summer hebert 1973 and do not reflect seasonal changes in metabolic rates experienced by bighorn sheep chappel and hudson 1980 which varied almost three fold for sierra bighorn further sierra bighorn moved only 1 7 2 0 km day 1 in winter compared to estimates of 10 km day 1 used by goodson et al 1991 appendix b compared with estimates of energy expenditures by reproductive female caribou on the tundra 308 mj kg 0 75 yr 1 assuming mean body mass of 105 kg and mean absolute expenditures of 10 100 mj boertje 1985 which have a similar life history single offspring annual fat cycle our estimates for sierra bighorn 374 mj kg 0 75 yr 1 were 21 greater the higher energy expenditures by bighorn sheep likely reflect more detailed seasonal estimates for rmr that are available for bighorn sheep chappel and hudson 1980 than caribou boertje 1985 mcewan and whitehead 1970 and that we assumed lactation continued over a longer period of time boertje 1985 all bioenergetic models are limited by data available to parameterize variables in the model rechsteiner et al 2013 when data were not available specifically for bighorn sheep we approximated costs from best available data for related species we allowed sierra bighorn to lactate to 168 days post partum consistent with reports for caribou gjøstein et al 2004 and lactation status i e milk expressed from udders of sierra bighorn at capture in late october unpublished data duration of lactation milk production and composition and timing of weaning however may vary among years relative to differences in nutrient availability berger 1979 gerhart et al 1997 gjøstein et al 2004 loudon and kay 1984 rachlow and bowyer 1998 white and luick 1984 if a lamb dies before weaning females also will be released of the substantial costs of lactation hence energy expenditures for lactation may be considerably more variable than we estimated additionally lactation costs can be much higher for other species than values we used robbins 1993 but we think the values we used were realistic for bighorn sheep given that they were derived from empirical estimates of lactation costs in other northern ungulates data specific to gestation and lactation costs in bighorn sheep would have improved our model regardless the values we used reflect costs for related species with similar reproductive strategies national research council 2007 robbins 1993 we assumed differences in nutrition and fasting could be generalized seasonally with highest nutrient intakes occurring during summer moderate nutrient intakes during spring and autumn and lowest nutrient intakes in winter periodically severe winter weather may preclude sierra bighorn from foraging and the model would benefit by accounting for stochastic but realistic fasting events our model accounted for seasonal changes in body fat based on empirical measurements which had not been accomplished previously finally because our model was sensitive to fix rates appendix a we recommend using it with high frequency location data 20 fixes per day but when high frequency location data are not available we recommend acknowledging that energy expenditures are underestimated appendix a additionally comparisons should not be made among individuals whose location data has dissimilar fix frequencies subsampling data to the same interval between fixes is recommended for such comparisons regardless of limitations our model provided estimates of energy expenditures by sierra bighorn that were based on the best available data there is a growing appreciation for understanding the implications of energetic constraints to conservation and management of large ungulates long et al 2014 mosser et al 2014 historically information on energetics of large ungulates has largely been inaccessible to decision makers hobbs 1989 but our energetics model is a tool that now is accessible to anyone desiring to quantify energy requirements of bighorn sheep and only requires basic skills in r e g changing file paths with slight modification our model can be adapted to other temperate ungulates our model identified intrasexual and seasonal differences in energy expenditures that may have important implications to seasonal habitat use population dynamics and conservation and management of bighorn sheep including estimating nutritional carrying capacity when coupled with estimates of food supplies more work is needed to understand how intrasexual and seasonal differences influence behavior and ecology of bighorn sheep but our results suggest that behavioral compensation may be an important strategy in the life history of sierra bighorn authors contributions kd

by sierra bighorn from estimates of energy requirements for metabolic rates feeding locomotion tissue synthesis i e replenishment of muscle and body fat and reproduction with data on body mass body fat and movements of sierra bighorn we hypothesized that energy expenditures by sierra bighorn would be context dependent occurring in some seasons but not others and state dependent varying relative

are most scarce in the environment and highest in summer when energy supplies are most abundant in the environment if energy expenditures by sierra bighorn were state dependent relative to reproductive state we predicted that reproductive females would expend less energy on activity than non reproductive females if energy expenditures by sierra bighorn were state dependent relative to nutritional state we predicted that 1 daily activity and associated energy expenditures during winter would be a function of autumn levels of body fat and 2 activity and associated energy expenditures would decrease as winter progressed and body fat stores were depleted 2 material and methods 2 1 study system and life history of sierra bighorn sierra bighorn occupy much of the sierra nevada between

julian day 176 for reproductive females for bmaut and bmmin in eq 3 2 4 calculating annual energy budgets we compiled estimates of energy expenditures on life processes by bighorn sheep available in primary literature to build a bioenergetic model for bighorn sheep table 1 resting metabolic rate rmr mj day 1 was the foundation of our model for bighorn sheep because rmr reflects the rate of energy use required to maintain basic physiological functions when animals are at rest robbins 1993 we calculated daily rmr rmrday according to eq 4 an adaptation of an equation presented by chappel and

defined seasons metabolically based on seasonal changes in metabolic rates reported by chappel and hudson 1980 table 1 and hence we defined autumn as sep oct coefficient 0 390 mj day 1 winter as nov feb coefficient 1 048 mj day 1 spring as mar apr coefficient 1 004 mj day 1 and summer as may aug coefficient 3 618 mj day 1 chappel and hudson 1980 did not report metabolic rates for jul aug but we assumed nutritional requirements remained elevated for reproduction and tissue synthesis in jul aug and hence we used the may jun adjustment to mean rmr for these months season also included adjustments for level of nutrient intake coefficients sep oct 0 224 mj day 1 nov feb 0 535 mj day 1 mar apr 0 846 mj day 1 and may aug 0 936 mj day 1 table 1 we also adjusted for seasonal exposure

bm f t where 0 0018 kj kg 1 h 1 is a constant bm is body mass kg and ft is feeding time h during jan may female sierra bighorn spent 43 of their time feeding schroeder et al 2010 or 10 3 h day 1 which we used as winter and spring foraging times in our model for summer and autumn where activity observations were not available for sierra bighorn we used average values for feeding time for other populations of bighorn and thinhorn ovis dalli spp sheep in north america during summer female ovis spp fed for an average of 13 h day 1 ruckstuhl 1998 seip and bunnell 1985 walker et al 2006 feeding time of female rocky mountain bighorn sheep averaged 10 6 h day 1 during autumn ruckstuhl 1998 we assumed that during summer and autumn when sheep have elevated energy requirements for lactation and rearing of young nonreproductive female ungulates foraged 2 h less per day than reproductive females denryter et al 2020 hence given average foraging time of 13 h day 1 and 2 h day 1 difference in foraging time between reproductive and non reproductive females we assumed foraging times of 12 h day 1 and 14 h day 1 during summer and 9 6 h day 1 and 11 6 h day 1 during autumn for non reproductive and reproductive females respectively although it would be a better strategy for non reproductive females to increase feeding times to levels of reproductive females digestion by non reproductive females is more physiologically constrained than reproductive females for example the rumen of lactating females increases in capacity and absorptive surface area compared with non lactating females luna and weckerly 2013 zimmerman et al 2006 and lactating females increase forage intake and ruminate faster than non lactating females blanchard 2005 campling 1970 gross et al 1995 k b monteith et al 2014 owen smith 2002 tulloh 1966 consequently among ruminants non reproductive females physiologically cannot eat as much as reproductive females denryter et al 2020 feeding times reflect changes to the heat increment of feeding rather than energy expenditures on feeding activities because we did not have complete activity budgets for sierra bighorn we used expenditures on locomotion as a surrogate for energy expenditures on activity we calculated daily movements in m of gps collared sierra bighorn as the sum of three dimensional euclidean distance between consecutive gps locations jenness 2004 in r r core team 2018 from a digital elevation model 30 m resolution we assigned values for costs of locomotion for moving up and down slopes according to values reported in the literature however these costs were reported only for a subset of slopes dailey and hobbs 1989 halsey and white 2017 lachica and aguilera 2005 table 2 for slopes of 1 to 1 we estimated net cost of locomotion j using eq 6 value for 0 slope in dailey and hobbs 1989 6 net cost of locomotion 4 95 bm dist where 4 95 j kg 1 m 1 is a constant bm is body mass kg and dist is distance m eqs 7 10 follow this form for slopes 1 10 we used the value for 3 5 slope halsey and white 2017 eq 7 7 net cost of locomotion 7 44 bm dist for slopes of 10 1 we used eq 8 value approximated for slopes of 3 5 slope in lachica et al 1997 8 net cost of locomotion 2 0 bm dist for slopes 10 we used eq 9 value for 21 5 slope in dailey and hobbs 1989 and halsey and white 2017 9 net cost of locomotion 21 08 bm dist for slopes of 10 we used eq 10 value for 21 5 slope in dailey and hobbs 1989 10 net cost of locomotion 5 34 bm dist daily movements across each slope class were summed and multiplied by corresponding energy costs for locomotion eqs 6 10 when a gps collar was unable to obtain any locations on a given day we used that individual s daily movement distance from the closest preceding day for which data were available we did not use data from animals missing 30 days of gps locations over a given year we included equations for locomotion through snow table 2 in the model but those did not apply in our study years 2009 2010 and 2012 2013 which were drought years and sierra bighorn wintered in snow free areas to determine energy expenditures on tissue synthesis we determined the quantities in kg of lean mass and fat that were catabolized by bighorn sheep overwinter and converted these values into their energy equivalents 19 2 mj kg 1 for lean mass protein and 39 5 mj kg 1 for fat robbins 1993 we assumed energy was used at 65 efficiency agricultural research council 1980 boertje 1985 hence equations for tissue synthesis were eqs 11 12 11 e m δ bm δ bf 19 2 0 65 12 e f δ bf 39 5 0 65 where em is the energy cost of muscle synthesis ef is the energy cost of fat synthesis and δbm and δbf are the differences in autumn and spring summer levels of body mass and body fat respectively in kg we determined relationships using equations for state dependent loss estimates for additional losses during lactation and assumptions that overwinter changes in ingesta free body fat accounted for 90 of overwinter mass change energy costs of gestation and lactation have not been measured empirically for bighorn sheep so we extrapolated these costs using data from other north temperate ungulates that have been studied in captivity national research council 2007 our extrapolations suggested that early gestation 1st and 2nd trimesters added 8 to daily energy requirements over maintenance costs rmr and late gestation 3rd trimester added 45 to daily energy requirements over maintenance costs based on calculations of energy requirements for cervids in national research council 2007 table 2 hence daily energetic costs of gestation were calculated according to eq 13 energy costs of gestation 1st and 2nd trimesters eg1 2 and eq 14 energy costs of gestation 3rd trimester eg3 13 e g 1 2 rmr 0 08 14 e g 3 rmr 0 45 given that gestation occurs over 175 days for bighorn sheep blunt et al 1977 we assumed that the first and second trimesters were 58 days each and the third trimester was 59 days we back calculated the beginning of gestation as 21 nov julian day 325 beginning 175 days before the median lambing date of 15 may for sierra bighorn forshee 2018 we assumed that all reproductive females successfully recruited a lamb to autumn so we could estimate that cost for lactation we used conservative generalizations of lactation costs and assumed energy costs of lactation on day 1 postpartum eli were as low as 65 of rmr eq 15 robbins 1993 15 e li 0 65 rm r t where rmr t is resting metabolic rate on day t of lactation in eq 15 t 1 we assumed an exponential increase from 65 of rmr on day 1

statistical analyses using stata14 statacorp college station tx usa for seasonal and annual totals including for each category of the energy budget i e metabolism activity reproduction tissue synthesis we collapsed data into one observation per individual on collapsed data we used the kruskal wallis test to evaluate whether total energy expenditures differed between reproductive and non reproductive females annually and intra seasonally for analyses that tracked daily expenditures of individuals rather than expenditures collapsed over a year or within a season we used multilevel mixed effects models hereafter multilevel models to account for the hierarchical nature of our data multiple observations per individual we fit multilevel models to energy expenditures with individual modeled as a random intercept the only fixed effect in these models was an intercept we fit separate multilevel models for reproductive and non reproductive females and compared 95 confidence intervals of the intercepts of these models to evaluate whether daily energy expenditures differed by reproductive status or season we also used multilevel models to evaluate whether energy expenditures on activity decreased as winter progressed with individuals modeled using a random intercept fit separately for reproductive and non reproductive females for comparisons of reproductive and non reproductive females wherein we had only one observation per individual body fat at onset of winter we used linear regression we also subsampled gps locations at intervals of 2 h 12 fixes day

discussion behavioral compensation can be an important strategy for individuals to regulate energy balances in environments where energy supplies cannot support energy demands year round and ultimately has implications to survival productivity and fitness we hypothesized that behavioral compensation in sierra bighorn was context dependent and state dependent our work suggests that as in larger bodied ungulates behavioral compensation was context dependent in female sierra bighorn occurring during the greatest nutritional bottleneck of the year winter and into spring results regarding state dependent behavioral compensation were more ambiguous as we did not detect a direct relationship between body fat at the onset of winter and movement or energy expenditures on locomotion during winter nevertheless energy expenditures for locomotion declined over winter concurrent with over winter declines in body fat and body mass providing indirect support for the hypothesis that behavioral compensation was state dependent we also expected state dependence to manifest relative to reproductive state because high costs of lactation may require additional foraging time and associated movement by lactating females denryter et al 2020 nevertheless daily movements and energy expenditures on locomotion were similar between reproductive and non reproductive females during summer collectively our results contrast those for some larger bodied ungulates including elk long et al 2014 and caribou denryter et al 2020 and may hint at allometric differences that constrain decisions about behavioral compensation or the potential for behavioral mediation of allee effects for example body size constrains forage processing van soest 1996 and allee effects that dilute risk of predation stephens and sutherland 1999 increase fitness of individuals gil et al 2018 or rescue populations from ecological traps schmidt et al 2015 may constrain foraging and movement behaviors in bighorn sheep strong selective pressures for group living in bighorn sheep may explain in part why our results were somewhat inconsistent with state dependent behavioral compensation group living dilutes predation risk on any one individual and group vigilance allows individuals in the group to forage more efficiently rieucau and martin 2008 benefits of group living may be rewarding enough to keep animals with lesser nutritional requirements moving with the group or alternatively animals with greater nutritional requirements may forgo some foraging opportunities for safety and foraging efficiency that comes with group living we cannot determine if similarities in movements of reproductive and non reproductive females reflect non reproductive females moving more than they needed to satisfy nutritional requirements reproductive females sacrificing some foraging opportunities or altering foraging behaviors to remain with the group or some combination of these regardless similarities in movements between reproductive and non reproductive females probably reflect strong evolutionary selection for group living chaplin 1982 markham and gesquiere 2017 roverud and chappell 1991 white and warner 2007 more work however is needed to understand implications of group living to energetics in bighorn sheep and how such relationships may scale allometrically among ungulates we also suspect that behavioral compensation may manifest through behaviors that we were unable to measure an energy model that incorporates high temporal resolution activity budgets either from accelerometers or direct observations of activity in addition to movement and accounts for potential influences of group living would provide more refined estimates of energy expenditures karasov 1992 the comparatively lower energy expenditures on activity by sierra bighorn during winter than summer supported the hypothesis that behavioral compensation was context dependent by reducing daily movement distances in winter sierra bighorn saved an average of 0 5 mj per day compared to summer or 6 days of total energy expenditures across the winter season seasonal changes in activity and other behaviors that conserve energy are assumed to be an adaptation to seasonal limitations in supplies of energy and perhaps other nutrients adamczewski et al 1993 lawler and white 2003 moen 1976 parker et al 1999 roby 1979 russell and martell 1986 and hence are a form of behavioral compensation increasing levels of behavioral compensation by sierra bighorn as winter progressed may reflect decreases in foraging profitability resulting from a diminishing gain function as forage quality continues declining through winter until green up begins in spring parker et al 1999 additionally bighorn sheep evolved a strategy of using escape terrain that spatially segregates them from their predators spatial segregation from predators may result in lower frequencies of predator encounters which may allow bighorn sheep to conserve energy by reducing locomotion associated with predator avoidance although north temperate ungulates including sierra bighorn use behavioral and physiological buffers against limited food supplies in winter they generally still lose body fat and mass over winter adamczewski et al 1987 cook et al 2013 mautz 1978 k l monteith et al 2014 stephenson et al 2020 thus behavioral and physiological adaptations cannot completely offset energy deficits that result from limited food supplies or limits to nutrient acquisition differences in seasonal energy expenditures identified in the model may suggest differences in the relative importance of energy supplies on summer versus winter ranges or differences in energetic constraints on each range given that fat gain occurs primarily on summer ranges for north temperate ungulates summer ranges have a key role in determining whether a female can accrete enough fat to successfully breed in autumn or survive through winter adamczewski et al 1993 cook et al 2004 2013 k l monteith et al 2014 parker et al 2009 winter ranges however increase in importance when summer ranges are nutritionally impoverished and cannot support accumulation of large fat reserves by animals monteith et al 2013 schmelzer and otto 2003 we think estimates of energy expenditures by sierra bighorn produced using our model were realistic as expected reproductive females had higher annual energy expenditures than non reproductive females and differences were largely attributable to costs of reproduction calculated using our energetics model our estimates of energy expenditures by sierra bighorn during winter 10 5 mj day 1 for non reproductive females and 10 2 mj day 1 for reproductive females were 29 48 lower than estimates of winter maintenance requirements 14 7 19 7 mj day 1 converted to metabolizable energy for comparison using a factor of 1 22 national research council 2007 derived by goodson et al 1991 for bighorn sheep in colorado we attribute this difference to the estimates of maintenance requirements and energy expenditures on movement locomotion used by goodson et al 1991 maintenance requirements used by goodson et al 1991 were derived from estimates for captive bighorn sheep during summer hebert 1973 and do not reflect seasonal changes in metabolic rates experienced by bighorn sheep chappel and hudson 1980 which varied almost three fold for sierra bighorn further sierra bighorn moved only 1 7 2 0 km day 1 in winter compared to estimates of 10 km day 1 used by goodson et al 1991 appendix b compared with estimates of energy expenditures by reproductive female caribou on the tundra 308 mj kg 0 75 yr 1 assuming mean body mass of 105 kg and mean absolute expenditures of 10 100 mj boertje 1985 which have a similar life history single offspring annual fat cycle our estimates for sierra bighorn 374 mj kg 0 75 yr 1 were 21 greater the higher energy expenditures by bighorn sheep likely reflect more detailed seasonal estimates for rmr that are available for bighorn sheep chappel and hudson 1980 than caribou boertje 1985 mcewan and whitehead 1970 and that we assumed lactation continued over a longer period of time boertje 1985 all bioenergetic models are limited by data available to parameterize variables in the model rechsteiner et al 2013 when data were not available specifically for bighorn sheep we approximated costs from best available data for related species we allowed sierra bighorn to lactate to 168 days post partum consistent with reports for caribou gjøstein et al 2004 and lactation status i e milk expressed from udders of sierra bighorn at capture in late october unpublished data duration of lactation milk production and composition and timing of weaning however may vary among years relative to differences in nutrient availability berger 1979 gerhart et al 1997 gjøstein et al 2004 loudon and kay 1984 rachlow and bowyer 1998 white and luick 1984 if a lamb dies before weaning females also will be released of the substantial costs of lactation hence energy expenditures for lactation may be considerably more variable than we estimated additionally lactation costs can be much higher for other species than values we used robbins 1993 but we think the values we used were realistic for bighorn sheep given that they were derived from empirical estimates of lactation costs in other northern ungulates data specific to gestation and lactation costs in bighorn sheep would have improved our model regardless the values we used reflect costs for related species with similar reproductive strategies national research council 2007 robbins 1993 we assumed differences in nutrition and fasting could be generalized seasonally with highest nutrient intakes occurring during summer moderate nutrient intakes during spring and autumn and lowest nutrient intakes in winter periodically severe winter weather may preclude sierra bighorn from foraging and the model would benefit by accounting for stochastic but realistic fasting events our model accounted for seasonal changes in body fat based on empirical measurements which had not been accomplished previously finally because our model was sensitive to fix rates appendix a we recommend using it with high frequency location data 20 fixes per day but when high frequency location data are not available we recommend acknowledging that energy expenditures are underestimated appendix a additionally comparisons should not be made among individuals whose location data has dissimilar fix frequencies subsampling data to the same interval between fixes is recommended for such comparisons regardless of limitations our model provided estimates of energy expenditures by sierra bighorn that were based on the best available data there is a growing appreciation for understanding the implications of energetic constraints to conservation and management of large ungulates long et al 2014 mosser et al 2014 historically information on energetics of large ungulates has largely been inaccessible to decision makers hobbs 1989 but our energetics model is a tool that now is accessible to anyone desiring to quantify energy requirements of bighorn sheep and only requires basic skills in r e g changing file paths with slight modification our model can be adapted to other temperate ungulates our model identified intrasexual and seasonal differences in energy expenditures that may have important implications to seasonal habitat use population dynamics and conservation and management of bighorn sheep including estimating nutritional carrying capacity when coupled with estimates of food supplies more work is needed to understand how intrasexual and seasonal differences influence behavior and ecology of bighorn sheep but our results suggest that behavioral compensation may be an important strategy in the life history of sierra bighorn authors contributions kd

24677,honeybees play an important role in the production of many agricultural crops and in sustaining plant diversity in undisturbed ecosystems the rapid decline of honeybee populations have sparked great concern worldwide field and theoretical studies have shown that the parasitic varroa mite varroa destructor anderson and trueman could be the main reason for colony losses in order to understand how mites affect population dynamics of honeybees and the health of a colony we propose a brood adult bee mite interaction model in which the time lag from brood to adult bee is taken into account noting that the temporal dynamics of a honeybee colony varies with respect to season we validate the model and perform parameter estimations under both constant and fluctuating seasonality scenarios our analytical and numerical studies reveal the following a in the presence of parasite mites the large time lag from brood to adult bee could destabilize population dynamics and drive the colony to collapse however the small natural mortality of the adult bee population can promote a mite free colony when time lag is small or at an intermediate level b small brood infestation rates could stabilize all populations at the unique interior equilibrium under constant seasonality while may drive the mite population to die out when seasonality is taken into account c high brood infestation rates can destabilize the colony dynamics leading to population collapse depending on initial population size under constant and seasonal conditions d results from our sensitivity analysis indicate that the queen s egg laying may have the greatest effect on colony population size the death rate of the brood and the colony size at which brood survivability is the half maximal were also shown to be highly sensitive with an inverse correlation to the colony population size our results provide insights on the effects of seasonality on the dynamics for example mites may die out leaving a healthy colony with brood and adult bees in the presence of seasonality while the colony collapses without seasonality keywords honeybee varroa mite colony loss seasonality delay differential equations 1 introduction honeybees apis mellifera are exemplars of social evolution known for their complex social organization linksvayer et al 2009 and are the most economically valuable pollinators of crops in the world doublet et al 2015 klein et al 2007 however honeybees colonies are being lost at alarming rates particularly over winter carreck and neumann 2010 doublet et al 2015 vanengelsdorp et al 2012 honeybee colony health is challenged by different factors including diseases such as american and european foulbrood chalkbrood stonebrood and nosema parasitism e g mites and nutritional stress oldroyd 2007 most notably the varroa mite has posed a huge threat on the honeybees well being degrandi hoffman et al 2017 2016 van dooremalen et al 2012 genersch et al 2010 guzmán novoa et al 2010 kang et al 2016 koleoglu et al 2017 sumpter and martin 2004 the dynamics within a honeybee colony are complicated and characterized by different behaviors performed by worker bees at different ages referred to as division of labor the behaviors include caring for the queen brood rearing foraging food storing and nest defense specifically brood rearing and colony growth depend on queen s egg laying activity that relies upon successful foraging by the workers thus creating the dynamics of a feedback system of interdependent elements degrandi hoffman et al 1989 honeybees must go through an optimal collective decision making process in order to sustain the colony the varroa mite is the most adverse parasite of the honeybee associated with a high percentage of colony losses over the

by direct physical damage or activation of viruses koleoglu et al 2017 for instance parasitized bee brood develop into adults with shorter abdomens deformed wings and shorter lifespans allen and ball

are more likely to get lost and wander between colonies koleoglu et al 2017 kralj et al 2007 the spread of mites through the bee population can be both vertically which occurs when phoretic mites travel upon the swarming bees and horizontally which occurs when infested brood is moved between colonies by beekeepers or when foragers are robbing honey from other colonies peck et al 2016 availability of brood in the colony is paramount for varroa mites reproduction given that it occurs in capped worker and drone brood cells when a mature female mite foundress enters the cell preceding capping degrandi hoffman et al 2017 rosenkranz et al 2010 the foundress starts feeding on the brood and continues to feed regularly thereafter donze et al 1996 the foundress lays its first egg which develops into a male and the second one into a female mite that mates with the male degrandi hoffman et al 2017 the mother mite keeps feeding on the developing larva and in the process transmits several viruses degrandi hoffman et al 2017 after the bee is fully developed and emerges from the capped cell the mother mite and offspring emerge with it and attach to other adult bees as phoretic mites degrandi hoffman et al 2017 in general phoretic mites target nurse bees cervo et al 2014 del piccolo et al 2010 because they remain in the brood area and serve as a medium to transport mites to brood cells where they can reproduce degrandi hoffman et al 2017 in recent years the population growth rates of varroa have exceeded those expected degrandi hoffman et al 2014 2017 2016 causing this pest to be difficult to control and a major factors in colony losses mathematical models have been powerful tools to help us understand the effects of mites e g kang et al 2016 disease e g kang et al 2016 ratti et al 2012 and pesticides e g magal et al 2019 2020 on honeybee population dynamics there are some models that are introduced to explore the role of mite infestation in honeybee colonies see the work of kribs zaleta and mitchell 2014 messan et al 2017 ratti et al 2012 2015 kang et al kang et al 2016 proposed a honeybee mite virus model that incorporates parasitic interactions between honeybees and varroa mites in addition to a virus transmission dynamics in this study it was found that low adult bees to brood ratios have destabilizing effects on the system can generate fluctuating dynamics and potentially lead to a catastrophic event where both honeybees and mites suddenly become extinct within a colony however kang et al 2016 did not explicitly model the brood population thus omitting the role of brood population size on mite s proliferation becher et al becher et al 2014 constructed an agent based model to explore how various stressors including varroa mites virus infections impaired foraging behavior changes in landscape structure pesticides etc affect the performance of single managed honeybee colonies while the latter work provides valuable results on different mechanisms that may induce the decline of honeybee population in a colony brood population was not taken into account explicitly an another approach studying the effects of varroa mites infestation on honeybees through dispersal mechanisms was done in messan et al 2017 this study contains a complete analysis of local and global dynamics of a two patch model that incorporates mite migration through bees foraging activities the results of this study provide insight on different scenarios where different migration rates can affect the bee population negatively or drive the mite population extinct within the colony however this study lacks focus on the different population dynamics that can arise within a colony from mechanisms such as reproduction and parasitism of mites on brood and adult bees motivated by work of degrandi hoffman et al 1989 messan et al 2017 we propose a single patch stage structure delay differential equation model that considers the time lag from brood to adult bees with parasite mites in seasonal environment the modeling framework used here is inspired by the work of aiello and freedman 1990 in the proposed model we focus on specific mechanisms related to mite reproduction and parasitism effects on the bees life cycle unlike other studies such as some of the ones mentioned earlier our proposed model incorporates individual mechanisms of brood and adult bees and their interactions with mites that give rise to different population dynamics at the colony level we assess the effects of different parameters affecting the population dynamics inside the colony more specifically we aim to use this model to explore how the synergistic effects of age structure and parasitism affect the colony dynamics in seasonal environment the seasonality in our model is reflected through the seasoning varying egg laying rate by the queen bee 2 model derivation let b t h t and m t denote the total population of brood adult honeybees and mites at time t respectively following the schematic diagram in fig 1 our model has the following assumptions let τ 0 be the time interval in which the population entering an homogeneous environment equals to the length of time from egg to fully developed adult bee we assume that all populations are known during the interval τ t 0 more specifically let b 0 t be the observed or assumed egg laying rate of the queen during the time interval τ t 0 the population of adult honeybee h t and mite m t are being constant during the time interval τ t 0 and we denote that h t h 0 and m t m 0 for all time t in τ t 0 our model is derived as follows and takes one form on the interval 0 t τ and a second form on the interval t τ 1 we assume that at any time t 0 the brood population b increases through the successful survivability of an egg into pupae stage represented by the term h 2 k h 2 which incorporates the collaborative efforts of adult workers via division of labor this term assumes that successful colonies produce more brood and efficient workers an assumption supported by eischen et al 1984 kang et al 2016 schmickl and crailsheim 2007 2 the brood adult bee and mite populations are assumed to have a natural average death rate proportional to the existing population denoted with constant parameters d b d h and d m respectively 3 both the brood and adult bee populations decrease through the parasitism effect of mites the probability of mites attaching to brood and adult bees is modeled with the terms b a b and h a h respectively where a is the size of the brood or adult bee population accordingly at which the rate of attachment is half maximal see a similar approach in betti et al 2014 sumpter and martin 2004 the parameters α b and α h measure the parasitism rate of mites on the brood and adult bees respectively 4 the mite population increases through the parasitism effects of brood that aids mite reproduction the work of boot et al 1997 garrido and rosenkranz 2003 steiner et al 1994 suggests that initiation of oocyte development in varroa depends on whether the female enters the brood cells of apis mellifera before operculation thus the term c α b b a b accounts for the production of new mites where c is the conversion factor from brood to mite population the mite equation could hence be described by 1 d m d t c α b b a b d m m 5 the life cycle of the female varroa is normally subdivided into a phoretic phase in which it lives on adult bees and a reproductive phase occurring within worker or drone brood cells thus the two life stages should be modeled explicitly however from the work of kang et al 2016 messan et al 2017 we assume an implicit age structure for the mite population where the ratio of different stages are constant for example consider ξ 0 1 to be the percentage of mites at the non phoretic stage then 1 ξ m is the phoretic mite population let d m d m 1 ξ then the phoretic mite equation becomes d m d t c α b b m a b d m 1 ξ m c α b b m a b d m m similar approach can be followed to find the reproductive mite population and by grouping the reproductive and phoretic mites together we obtain the mite model defined as in 1 6 we assume that eggs laid by the queen at time t τ which survive to time t i e r h t τ 2 k h t τ 2 exit or mature from the brood population b and enter the adult bee population h the survival of the brood depends on their own natural death and if they survive the mite infestation therefore the probability of survival is e t τ t d b α b m s a b s d s when 0 t τ and t τ we follow a similar approach and derivation as in aiello and freedman 1990 and obtain the number of brood that survive into adult bees b 0 t τ e t τ t d b α b m s a b s d s when 0 t τ and r h t τ 2 k h t τ 2 e t τ t d b α b m s a b s d s when t τ 7 for continuity of initial conditions and following a similar approach as in aiello and freedman 1990 the total surviving brood population from the observed eggs laid on τ t 0 is b 0 τ 0 b 0 t d t 0 the model formulated by the assumptions provided above is therefore composed by two time intervals 0 t τ and t τ in the following form for t 0 τ 2 d b d t r h 2 k h 2 egg production α b b a b probability of m attaching to b m parasitism on brood d b b natural death e t τ t d b α b m s a b s d s b 0 t τ maturation from egg to adult d h d t e t τ t d b α b m s a b s d s

from brood parasitism d m m natural death with initial conditions 4 b t b 0 t 0 t τ 0 h 0 0 m 0 0 where b 0 t c c τ 0 0 is the brood population at t τ 0 with these initial conditions our model describes a scenario where mite reproduction and parasitism initiate at time t 0 we note that the age structure of mite population was not taken into account in the next section we compare the dynamics of our proposed model with and without parasite m t to gain insights on the effects of mites 3 mathematical analysis for a starter we provide basic dynamical properties of model 2 3 as follows theorem 3 1 solution b t h t m t of system 2 3 satisfying 4 is positive for all t 0 in addition lim sup t b t h t m t c r min d b d h d m biological implications the existence and uniqueness of our model 2 3 follows directly from theorem 3 1 in smith smith 2011 thus it is omitted in our analysis theorem 3 1 implies that model 2 3 is well defined biologically in terms of its solution being positive invariant and bounded 1 solution being positive invariant refers to that the population will never become negative when its initial population is positive or zero and 2 solution being bounded refers to that population has its capacity and will not grow infinity due to unlimited resources 3 1 dynamics of honeybees in this subsection we present a summary of the dynamics of the honeybee only system studied in chen et al 2020 when m 0 0 the honeybee mite system 2 3 reduces to the following honeybee only subsystem 5 6 for t 0 τ 5 d b d t r h 2 t k h 2 t d b b t e d b τ b 0 t τ d h d t e d b τ b 0 t τ d h h t for t τ 6 d b d t r h 2 t k h 2 t d b b t e d b τ r h 2 t τ k h 2 t τ d h d t e d b τ r h 2 t τ k h 2 t τ d h h t let 7 h 1 2 r e d b τ 2 d h 1 1 2 d h e d b τ r 2 k with h 1 h 2 hence the subsystem 5 6 has two interior equilibria e i b i h i with 8 b i 1 d b 1 e d b τ r h i 2 k h i 2 d h e d b τ 1 d b h i i 1 2 based on the work of chen et al chen et al 2020 the dynamical results of the subsystem 5 6 are summarized as follows also see table 1 1 the extinction equilibrium e e 0 0 of the subsystem 5 6 always exists and is always locally asymptotically stable 2 if r d h 2 e d b τ k the subsystem 5 6 has global stability at the extinction equilibrium e e 3 if r d h 2 e d b τ k the subsystem 5 6 has a unique interior equilibrium e b h r 1 e d b τ 2 d b k which is always locally asymptotically stable for any delay τ 0 4 if r d h 2 e d b τ k the subsystem 5 6 has two attractors the extinction equilibrium e e and the interior equilibrium e 2 b 2 h 2 which are locally asymptotically stable results from section 3 1 indicate that in the absence of parasitic mite colonies are left with adult honeybee and brood the survival of colony is determined by the values of r e d b τ d h and 2 k note that r e d b τ d h r e d b τ the survived brood that becomes honeybee adult 1 d h the average life span of honeybee adult and let 2 k be the critical honeybee adult population that the brood survival could be maximum then the colony can survive if the average total honeybee adult population during its life time r e d b τ d h is larger than the critical honeybee adult population 2 k alternatively we could also expect that the larger the natural death rate of adult bee more likely survival of the colony 3 2 dynamics of the full system first we look at the equilibria of model 2 3 by setting d b d t d h d t d m d t 0 we obtain the subsequent equations 9a r h 2 k h 2 α b b m a b d b b r h 2 k h 2 e d b α b m a b τ 0 9b 2 c m r h 2 k h 2 e d b α b m a b τ α h h m a h d h h 0 9c 2 c m c α b b m a b d m m 0 from eqs 9a 9c we know that if τ 0 then system 2 3 has only the trivial boundary equilibrium e 000 0 0 0 moreover if d h r e d b τ 2 k then model 2 3 has the following two boundary equilibria e b 1 h 1 0 b 1 h 1 0 and e b 2 h 2 0 b 2 h 2 0 where b i and h i i 1 2 are shown in 8 and 7 with h 1 h 2 for the convenience of the reader we show their expressions as follows b i d h e d b τ 1 d b h i and h i e d b τ d b r d b r 2 4 d b 2 d h 2 k e 2 d b τ 2 d b d h the following theorem concerns the stability of these boundary equilibria theorem 3 2 boundary equilibria dynamics model 2 3 always has the extinction equilibrium e 000 which is always locally asymptotically stable if d h r e d b τ 2 k model 2 3 has additionally two boundary equilibria e b 1 h 1 0 and e b 2 h 2 0 where e b 1 h 1 0 is always unstable the equilibrium e b 2 h 2 0 is however locally asymptotically stable when d m c α b b 2 a b 2 and unstable when d m c α b b 2 a b 2 biological implications theorem 3 2 first elucidates the possibility of all populations i e brood adult bee and mite dying out due to the initial population size and thus the existence and local stability of the extinction equilibrium e 000 we point out that c α b b 2 a b 2 c α b successful parasitism rate on brood for mite reproduction b 2 a b 2 the probability of mites attaching to brood is the parasitism on brood that transfers into the mite population thus if the term c α b b 2 a b 2 is less than the mite death rate d m then mite can not survive and the colony is left with brood and adult honeybee by comparing the local stability condition of the equilibrium e b 2 h 2 0 of model 2 3 to the local stability condition of the equilibrium e b 2 h 2 of model 5 6 see table 1 it implies that parasitism with smaller mortality rates e g d m c α b b 2 a b 2 can destabilize the full system such that e b 2 h 2 0 becomes unstable the destabilization due to the introduction of parasites m into the honeybee colony has been observed in our model s simulations as well see fig 2 in the next section the next theorem focuses on the global stability of the extinction equilibrium e 000 of model 2 3 theorem 3 3 global stability of full system 2 3 if d h r e d b τ 2 k and d m c α b the extinction equilibrium e 000 0 0 0 is globally asymptotically stable biological implications theorem 3 3 indicates that when the average total honeybee adult population during its life time r e d b τ d h is less than the critical honeybee adult population 2 k and the natural death rate of the mite population d m is larger than the efficiency of parasitism on brood for mite reproduction α b i e d m c α b then all population i e brood adult honeybee and mite will die out independently of their initial population size thus the large mortality rate of honeybees d h and mites d m can lead to the colony collapsing next we focus on the existence of interior equilibria of model 2 3 that could lead to colony survival model 2 3 has no interior equilibria when τ 0 therefore the existence of interior equilibria requires the delay τ 0 our aim is to find sufficient conditions such that model 2 3 has interior equilibria that can lead to the survival of the honeybee colony to begin our analysis note that from eq 9c b a c α b d m 1 0 that is the inequality c α b d m 1 is required then using eqs 9a and 9b we obtain follows 10 r h 2 k h 2 α b b m a b d b b α h h m a h d h h let f 1 h r h 2 k h 2 and f 2 h b α b m a b d b 1 e α b m a b d b τ where b b m r h 2 k h 2 d b b d h h α h h a h α b b a b and 11 q h d h h

existence of an interior equilibrium of model 2 3 is provided in the following theorem theorem 3 4 existence of interior equilibria let a α b α h c k r d b d h d m and τ be positive parameters assume c α b d m 1 d h r b d b 3 k and q h 2 c 0 then q h has two positive roots h 1 r and h 2 r h 1 r h 2 r and model 3 has at least one interior equilibria e b h m b h m with b a c α b d m 1 when τ β 1 β 2 where β 1 1 d b ln f 1 h 2 r f 1 h 2 r b d b β 2 1 d b ln f 1 h 1 r f 1 h 1 r b d b in addition if d h is sufficiently small such that d h r b d b 2 r b d b 3 k r b d b 3 d b k b then q h 2 c 0 biological implications theorem 3 4 implies that when the ratio of the mites reproduction efficiency to their death rate is sufficiently large i e c α b d m a d b r r 1 and the queen s egg production is adequately large satisfying r d b b model 2 3 may have no interior equilibrium i e either all species die out or the colony is left with brood and adult honeybees unless the conditions q h 2 c 0 f 2 h 1 f 1 h 1 and f 2 h 2 f 1 h 2 are satisfied in which case a unique interior equilibrium emerges i e brood adult honeybees and mites are present in the colony the expressions of the interior equilibria are very complex to obtain analytical solutions thus we seek help from numerical simulations to explore the stability of the interior equilibria 4 numerical results 4 1 effects of parasitism in this section we focus on the dynamical effects of parasitism and seasonality on colony survival to explore the effects of parasites m we compare the typical long term dynamics of system 2 3 when m 0 0 and m 0 0 through simulations fig 2 shows that 1 when m 0 0 the honeybee colony has equilibrium dynamics and the colony can survive while 2 when m 0 1 we can see that both honeybees and mites coexist through oscillating dynamics thus we could deduce that the introduction of mites i e m 0 can have a destabilizing effect on the system and produce fluctuating dynamics of the honeybee population brood and adult bees and mites when the time delay τ is large enough for these simulations we are using τ 21 which corresponds to the time it takes for an egg to become an adult bee we would like to point out that varying α b i e parasitism rate on brood has a potential to destabilize the dynamics thus drive the population through oscillating dynamics see figs 12 and 13 in appendix b long term dynamics of model 2 3 with m 0 and m 0 effects of delay with parasitism from theorem 3 4 we can confirm that there is a unique interior equilibrium when we choose parameter values r 1500 k 95000000 d b 0 051 d h 0 0121 d m 0 027 α b 0 024 α h 0 8 c 1 9 a 8050 we take initial conditions b 0 t b 0 0 h 0 9000 and m 0 3 and vary the maturation time τ 0 26 in fig 3 then we have the following dynamics with τ 15 e b h m 11 685 5 16 727 2 579 905 stable equilibrium see fig 3 a c with τ 21 e b h m 11 685 5 12 102 5 338 558 periodic solutions see fig 3 d f with τ 26 e b h m 11 685 5 10 607 8 189 793 unstable equilibrium see fig 3 g i these simulations suggest that as τ increases 0 τ 16 the interior equilibrium is asymptotically stable with our choice of parameter values above then for 16 τ 26 the system has periodic solutions which could be due to a possible hopf bifurcation lastly for τ 26 the interior equilibrium becomes unstable with a large oscillating cycle that hits the stable manifold of the extinction equilibrium e 000 such that both honeybee and mite populations die out delay effects on model 2 3 long term dynamics 4 2 seasonality and parameter estimation the number of eggs laid by the queen bee can be predicted as a function of the ambient temperature photoperiod and adult population in the colony degrandi hoffman et al 1989 in addition it has also been shown that the total number of eggs laid daily by the queen is a decreasing function of the number of days the queen has been laying eggs degrandi hoffman et al 1989 given that the number of eggs laid by the queen is temperature and photoperiod dependent i e changed seasonally the egg laying rate must hence be described by a periodic function it is well known that any periodic function can be represented as an infinite sum of sines and cosines feng et al 2011 in order to keep our model simple and tractable we combined these factors i e temperature photoperiod etc and adapted the first order harmonic function presented in feng et al 2011 to the constant egg laying rate r we define r 1 t to be the time dependent egg laying rate at time t of a full mated queen 12 r 1 t r 1 c o s 2 π t φ 365 where φ denote the day of the year with the maximum egg laying rate r is the baseline egg laying rate from eberl et al 2010 sumpter and martin 2004 and t is the time measured in days therefore the expression in our model 2 3 representing the egg production is modified to r 1 t h t 2 k h t 2 and the eggs laid by the queen at time t τ which survive to time t is now represented by r 1 t τ h t τ 2 k h t τ 2 model 2 3 with a constant egg laying rate r is a model without seasonality and by modifying the egg laying rate to the harmonic function in eq 12 we introduced seasonality the parameters φ and r were estimated by fitting the eq 12 to a one year simulated data of the number of eggs laid per day from the beepop model degrandi hoffman et al 1989 see fig 4 all parameter estimations were conducted using the findfit function from mathematica 11 2 to compute the best least squares fit in order to estimate parameters α b α h and a in the model with and without seasonality we first estimated the brood adult honeybee and mite population size per colony from field data provided by degrandi hoffman degrandi hoffman et al 2016 the data were collected at the university of arizona west agricultural facility 20 colonies the colonies were established in desert climate of arizona where temperatures are favorable for bees foraging activity especially from april through november when the data were collected all colonies initially were broodless and had 9000 bees with a laying queen a miticide treatment was applied to control the varroa population at the beginning of the experiment april of 2014 in order to approximate the adult honeybee and brood population sizes in the colonies frames of bees were measured monthly from may to november using a method from degrandi hoffman et al 2008 this method consist of estimating brood and adult bees on an area of the frames using a 5 cm 5 cm grid which covers the entire side of the comb note that one frame of bees contains approximately 2506 bees and 5200 brood cells degrandi hoffman et al 2008 and at most only 80 of frames are cover with brood thus each colony of adult bees is estimated by computing the number of frames of adult bees 2506 and a colony of brood is estimated as the number of frames of brood 0 8 5200 the varroa mite population density in the colonies were also collected from may until november during the experiment season i e may to november 300 bees were brushed into a jar then the number of mites on the 300 bees were counted monthly and these constitute the phoretic mites the population of the reproductive mites was also estimated by counting the total number of mites per sampled cells the total mite population in a colony is hence the sum of the phoretic and reproductive mite we proceeded as follow to find the estimated mite population in colonies recall that the number of phoretic mites obtained is the mites per 300 bees then the phoretic mite population size per colony was estimated by mites per 300 bees 300 population of bees per colony we calculated the reproductive mites per colony by multiplying total number of mites 5200 number of cells sampled in degrandi hoffman et al 2016 the authors followed a similar approach to estimate the population size of brood adult bees and mites per colony using varroa mites and honeybee life history parameters in the ranges provided in table 2 we estimated the parameters α b α h a without considering seasonality α b 0 045 α h 0 49 and a 8500 and in the presence of seasonality α b 0 0447 α h 0 8 and a 8050 by fitting the model to the data when the egg laying rate r is constant and when r is the harmonic function described in eq 12 respectively to illustrate the importance of seasonality when modeling the dynamics of honeybee and mite populations we present the best fit without seasonality in figs 5 and the best fit with seasonality in figs 6 using the egg laying rate function in 12 best fit without seasonality best fit with seasonality comparisons between the best fit of the model with and without seasonality figs 5 and 6 1 a better fit of the model simulation to the data is obtained when seasonality is taken into account in fig 6 as oppose to fig 5 this reflects a more realistic life history parameters of honeybees and mites as presented in fig 6 2 the parameter values used for both with and without seasonality model 2 3 produce the following equilibrium points e 000 0 0 0 e b 1 h 1 0 24171 20930 2 0 e b 2 h 2 0 1931 15 1672 22 0 we highlight that under these parameter values the sufficient conditions in theorem 3 4 for the existence of interior equilibrium are not satisfied thus there is no interior point according to theorem 3 2 e 000 and e b 1 h 1 0 are asymptotically stable while e b 2 h 2 0 is unstable given initial conditions in the simulations shown in fig 5 a and b honeybee and mite populations go extinct as t however for other initial conditions we could have the survival of only the honeybee 3 the population of brood and adult bees are driven extinct without seasonality in approximately 350 days while mite population in approximately 500 days this is an unrealistic situation as the mite population cannot outlive the colony population but rather should die with the colonie with seasonality all populations went extinct in approximately 600 days this result first indicates that including seasonality provides a more realistic scenario on the modeling of brood bee mite interaction in addition the environmental changes due to seasonality could promote a longer survival of honeybee colony infested by the varroa mites this highlights the effects of seasonal fluctuation on survivability of species 4 in the presence of seasonality the population of brood adult bee and mites tend to have a second rise after approximately one year and this is due to the resumption of egg laying rate by the queen in the late winter as illustrated in fig 4 see the second peak starting in february 24 effects of infestation rate on brood population α b and seasonality in appendix b we provide comparison on the role of α b on the population dynamics of brood adult bee and mite in figs 7 12 fig0013 14 those simulations show time series simulations and comparison of the dynamics with and without seasonality under different α b values for these simulations parameters were chosen such that a unique interior equilibrium exists and is locally stable for the smallest value of α b i e when the unique interior equilibrium is stable without seasonality and α b 0 022 taking seasonality into account causes the mite population to die out while the adult bee population stabilizes and the brood population fluctuates fig 7 an intermediate value of α b 0 024 has the potential to generate fluctuating dynamics without seasonality while only the mite population dies out when seasonality is considered fig 12 in the presence of seasonality a larger α b i e 0 027 has the potential to drive the brood adult bee and mite through non periodic dynamics while all populations die out without seasonality fig 13 a large value of α b 0 028 has the ability to drive colonies to collapse irrespective of seasonality fig 14 while colonies can collapse under large α b and in the absence of control measure the results presented in fig 14 show that all populations die out before the third year 1000 th day when seasonality is not taken into account populations persist over four years when seasonality is included such result highlights the importance of considering seasonality when modeling the population dynamics of honeybees colonies infested with varroa mite 4 3 sensitivity analysis data fitting and parameter estimation with and without seasonality of α b α h and a are provided in section 4 2 using colonies data from degrandi hoffman et al 2008 see fig 5 for fitting without seasonality and fig 6 for fitting with seasonality and all other parameters sources are listed in table 2 it is often noted in mathematical biology that natural variation error in measurements may cause a variation in the parameter of the system marino et al 2008 thus identifying critical input parameters of a model and quantifying how the uncertainty of such parameters impact model outcome is paramount this section measures and quantifies the effect of parameter sensitivity on the population size of brood adult bee and mite respectively through global sensitivity analysis sa as noted by marino et al 2008 different sa techniques will perform better for specific types of mathematical and computational models there have been numerous global sensitivity methods discussed in the literature for a detailed review on monte carlo analysis and variance decomposition methods see cacuci and ionescu bujor 2004 iman and helton 1988 ionescu bujor and cacuci 2004 saltelli and bolado 1998 however in order to obtain a holistic view regarding the sensitivity of the input parameters on the model outcome two different sa methods were employed 1 the partial rank correlation coefficient prcc sa with latin hypercube sampling or lhs first introduced by mckay et al 1979 as the sampling technique 2 and the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast we followed the methodology discussed in marino et al 2008 for both sa methods i e lhs prcc and efast for our analysis sa was conducted on the time corresponding to the largest population size in fig 6 as output and the eleven parameters of model 2 3 when seasonality is taken into account using the egg laying rate formula 12 the time corresponding to the largest population size was selected to determine how the input parameters might affect the brood adult bee and mite population at their peak thus maintaining or causing the collapse of the colony the results of the sa are presented in figs 8 10 for the brood adult honeybee and mite populations both prcc and efast values in fig 8 indicate that r d b and k are the most sensitive parameters affecting the brood population size with r the maximum queen s egg laying rate being the most sensitive of the three the prcc values of φ and d h in fig 8 b appear to be at the intermediate level 0 5 as shown in table 3 in appendix b the parameters d m α b α h a and c are shown not to have a high sensitivity value in both fig 8 a and b suggesting that the largest brood population size is not sensitive to mite infestation rate but rather the queen s ability to lay eggs which is a function of seasonality age of the queen colony size nutrition etc degrandi hoffman et al 1989 it is observable in figs 9 and 10 that the most sensitive parameters affecting the adult bee and mite populations size from both the prcc and efast indexes are r α b and c moreover the input parameters d b and d m have a high sensitivity to the mite population from both the prcc and efast indexes fig 10 indicating that reduction of the mite mortality through proper control measure may release parasitic pressure on the colony it is significant to point out that the maximum queen s egg laying rate r appears to be the most sensitive parameter affecting the population size of the brood adult honeybees i e the entire colony of honeybees and mites under both prcc and efast sa methods figs 8 9 and 10 these results have been confirmed by degrandi hoffman et al 1989 where the authors stated that the queen s egg laying potential has the greatest effect on colony population size it is also noticeable that the natural mortality of adult bees i e α h is not very sensitive to the brood adult bee and mite populations the sa also reveals that the infestation rate on the brood i e α b may be another important parameter affecting the population size of the colony see high prcc and efast indexes values in table 4 and 5 in appendix b 5 conclusion colonies of honeybees have been declining for over a decade le conte et al 2010 colony losses are due to a combination of stressors hayes jr et al 2008 le conte et al 2010 but the presence of varroa mites has been considered as one of the most important factors degrandi hoffman and curry 2004 van dooremalen et al 2012 genersch et al 2010 guzmán novoa et al 2010 kang et al 2016 messan et al 2017 in this study we proposed a nonlinear stage structure delay differential equations model that describes the interactions between brood adult honeybees and mites in a single patch framework where the maturation from brood to adult honeybees was taken into account moreover noting that the temporal dynamics of honeybee colonies vary with respect to time of year e g temperature photoperiod etc winston 1991 and the effects on the egg laying rate of the queen seasonality was incorporated into our model comparisons are made between simulation predictions with and without seasonality the theoretical results provide insights on how the presence of mites affect population dynamics of the adult honeybee and brood population it follows from our results that initial population size plays an important role in sustaining a healthy bee colony colony size affects egg lay rates and larger colony sizes can rear more brood enabling the population to grow a low natural death rate also contributes to a relatively rapid increase of the bee population the introduction of mites into a healthy colony was shown to have dire effects on the colony growth mites can generate fluctuating dynamics of the colony population i e brood adult bees and mites though the process behind the population oscillation is not completely clear this phenomenon can result in the extinction of the colony kang et al 2016 the delay parameter i e the development time from brood to adult bee can stabilize destabilize or even promote fluctuating dynamics leading to the coexistence or death of all species in this study larger development time combined with mites can destabilize population dynamics that could drive the colony collapsing it was pointed out in puškadija et al 2017 that unfavourable weather conditions after the queen bee starts with intensive oviposition during the early spring may cause an imbalance in the division of tasks among worker bees leading to slow spring development moreover the development time is known to be influenced by climatic conditions and food availability nunes silva et al 2006 possible explanation of the destabilization effect shown in this work due to large development time could hence be a detrimental weather condition seasonality impacts population dynamics most notably due to the effects on the egg laying rate of the queen in our simulations where seasonality is not considered i e when brood rearing does not depend on seasonality there could be stable equilibrium dynamics so that both the colony and mite population coexist at the unique interior equilibrium however under conditions where seasonality is considered no such equilibrium exists and colony collapses in general our simulations that omit seasonal effects on colony dynamics provide unrealistic scenarios where mite population outlives the colony population this unrealistic outcome was expected as mite population size varies from fall to spring as shown in the work of degrandi hoffman et al 2017 degrandi hoffman and curry 2004 and thus illustrating the importance of year round seasonality on predicting the mite population size and its effect on a colony the work of wilkinson and smith 2002 also pointed to the importance of seasonality in the brood adult bee mite dynamics the authors found that seasonal variation in brood rearing of the host honeybees is more important to the mite population growth rate than the reproductive rate of the mite other authors have also emphasized the importance of seasonality for mite population growth see the work of camphor et al 2005 nürnberger et al 2019 ratti et al 2015 sakofski et al 1990 in our work when we incorporated a time periodic dependent parameter in the egg laying ability to simulate the seasonal brood rearing cycle the population predictions aligned well with the actual data and indicated that sensitivity to environmental parameters associated with season is essential for generating realistic brood adult bee mite population scenarios in fact the severe overwintering honeybee population losses discussed by other authors guzmán novoa et al 2010 sakofski et al 1990 has also been observed in our simulations where the growth of the mite population led to the decline of both the brood and adult bee population when seasonality was taken into account the results of our sensitivity analysis from our prcc and efast showed that the queen s egg laying rate has the greatest impact on the colony s population size which supports the work of degrandi hoffman et al 1989 colony size also was sensitive to the mite infestation rate of the brood population this was expected as the infestation by the varroa destructor has been noted to be one of the major stressors of colony decline genersch et al 2010 guzmán novoa et al 2010 rosenkranz et al 2010 our results also illustrated the dynamics generated by the mite to brood infestation rate on the population size with and without seasonality when seasonality is not taken into account small infestation of the brood population could promote coexistence of all species at the interior equilibrium intermediate infestation rate could yield the coexistence of all species through fluctuating dynamics and large infestation rate could drive the colony to collapse however by incorporating seasonality our results showed that mite population could die out under small and large infestation rate but all the populations may go through non periodic dynamics under an intermediate infestation rate on the brood population moreover by comparing the seasonal and non seasonal dynamics our results indicated that in the environment where high seasonal fluctuation is present infested colonies may survive longer than in an environment when small or no fluctuation occurs these findings highlight the importance of seasonality in the honeybee interaction with varroa mite and some of the parameters that may promote a mite free colony or drive the colony to collapse as honeybee population continues to decline understanding the related causes is critical to alleviate this ecological disturbance this study is the first to explicitly model brood adult bee mite interaction and incorporate the development time from brood to adult bee by using a distributed delay our findings revealed the catastrophic effects that mites can have on a healthy colony by illustrating that the large development time from brood to adult bee can have the destabilizing effects on an infested colony i e brood adult bee and mite population this study demonstrates that while colony survival can be threaten by the availability of mites favorable environmental conditions e g weather food resources may promote species coexistence and thus represent complex intertwined ecological processes moreover we elucidated how higher climatic fluctuations could promote longer survivability of brood and adult bees in an infested colony comparing the model with and without seasonality illustrated that incorporating seasonality is viable to simulate realistic honeybee population dynamics seasonality was shown to play a crucial role in the honeybee population cycles and it represents an important component in mathematical models describing the interaction of honeybee and its parasitic varroa mite it will be interesting to study similar dynamics when honeybee population is prone to use a defensive mechanism such as grooming behavior this

m h is determined by q h i if r b d b 0 then for all h 0 q h 0 in this case model 3 has no interior equilibria ii let r b d b 0 by q h 3 d h h 2 2 r b d b h d h k we have two cases 1 if δ 4 r b d b 2 12 k d h 2 0 then for all h r q h 0 notice q 0 0 we know that for all h 0 q h 0 this implies that model 3 has no interior equilibria for this case 2 if δ 4 r b d b 2 12 k d h 2 0 i e d h r b d b 3 k then q h has two positive roots h 1 c h 2 c h 1 2 c r d b b r d b b 2 3 k d h 2 3 d h in which h 1 c is the minimum point and h 2 c is the maximum point of q h if q h 2 c 0 then for all h 0 q h 0 and model 3 has no interior equilibria if q h 2 c 0 then q h has exact two positive roots denoted as h 1 r h 2 r satisfying q h 0 for h h 1 r h 2 r and q h 0 for h 0 h 1 r h 2 r thus in order to show the existence of at least one interior equilibria we only need to find a root of f 1 h f 2 h in h 1 r h 2 r note that f 1 h and f 2 h have the following properties a f 1 0 0 lim h f 1 h r and f 1 h is strictly increasing on 0 which implies f 1 h 1 r f 2 h 2 r b lim h 0 f 2 h b τ 0 lim h f 2 h 0 since lim h m h c f 2 h 1 r f 2 h 2 r b d b 1 e τ d b since m h 1 r m h 2 r 0 d by 20 and the fact m h 1

interior equilibrium noticing property d and solving 21 we get β 1 τ β 2 where β 1 1 d b ln f 1 h 2 r f 1 h 2 r b d b β 2 1 d b ln f 1 h 1 r f 1 h 1 r b d b therefore if τ β 1 β 2 then model 3 has at least one interior equilibria at last we give a sufficient condition which is easy to be verified such that q h 2 c 0 from the property of cubic function q h we know that it has unique point of

q h 0 0 and hence q h 2 c 0 proof of theorem 3 3 proof by the positivity of solutions of model 2 3 the third equation of 3 implies that d m d t c α b d m m t 0 since c α b d m 1 thus lim t m t 0 then the model reduces to the model of chen et al chen et al 2020 the global stability of e 00 we know that lim t b t lim t h t 0 if d h r e d b τ 2 k the proof is complete appendix b 
24677,honeybees play an important role in the production of many agricultural crops and in sustaining plant diversity in undisturbed ecosystems the rapid decline of honeybee populations have sparked great concern worldwide field and theoretical studies have shown that the parasitic varroa mite varroa destructor anderson and trueman could be the main reason for colony losses in order to understand how mites affect population dynamics of honeybees and the health of a colony we propose a brood adult bee mite interaction model in which the time lag from brood to adult bee is taken into account noting that the temporal dynamics of a honeybee colony varies with respect to season we validate the model and perform parameter estimations under both constant and fluctuating seasonality scenarios our analytical and numerical studies reveal the following a in the presence of parasite mites the large time lag from brood to adult bee could destabilize population dynamics and drive the colony to collapse however the small natural mortality of the adult bee population can promote a mite free colony when time lag is small or at an intermediate level b small brood infestation rates could stabilize all populations at the unique interior equilibrium under constant seasonality while may drive the mite population to die out when seasonality is taken into account c high brood infestation rates can destabilize the colony dynamics leading to population collapse depending on initial population size under constant and seasonal conditions d results from our sensitivity analysis indicate that the queen s egg laying may have the greatest effect on colony population size the death rate of the brood and the colony size at which brood survivability is the half maximal were also shown to be highly sensitive with an inverse correlation to the colony population size our results provide insights on the effects of seasonality on the dynamics for example mites may die out leaving a healthy colony with brood and adult bees in the presence of seasonality while the colony collapses without seasonality keywords honeybee varroa mite colony loss seasonality delay differential equations 1 introduction honeybees apis mellifera are exemplars of social evolution known for their complex social organization linksvayer et al 2009 and are the most economically valuable pollinators of crops in the world doublet et al 2015 klein et al 2007 however honeybees colonies are being lost at alarming rates particularly over winter carreck and neumann 2010 doublet et al 2015 vanengelsdorp et al 2012 honeybee colony health is challenged by different factors including diseases such as american and european foulbrood chalkbrood stonebrood and nosema parasitism e g mites and nutritional stress oldroyd 2007 most notably the varroa mite has posed a huge threat on the honeybees well being degrandi hoffman et al 2017 2016 van dooremalen et al 2012 genersch et al 2010 guzmán novoa et al 2010 kang et al 2016 koleoglu et al 2017 sumpter and martin 2004 the dynamics within a honeybee colony are complicated and characterized by different behaviors performed by worker bees at different ages referred to as division of labor the behaviors include caring for the queen brood rearing foraging food storing and nest defense specifically brood rearing and colony growth depend on queen s egg laying activity that relies upon successful foraging by the workers thus creating the dynamics of a feedback system of interdependent elements degrandi hoffman et al 1989 honeybees must go through an optimal collective decision making process in order to sustain the colony the varroa mite is the most adverse parasite of the honeybee associated with a high percentage of colony losses over the winter koleoglu et al 2017 mites are known to parasitize both brood and adult bees mites are rarely found attached to queens degrandi hoffman et al 2017 mites affect honeybees in different ways either by direct physical damage or activation of viruses koleoglu et al 2017 for instance parasitized bee brood develop into adults with shorter abdomens deformed wings and shorter lifespans allen and ball 1996 de jong et al 1982 koleoglu et al 2017 due to suppressed expression of genes related to longevity and development e g protein storage vitellogenin etc navajas et al 2008 also parasitized foragers are more likely to get lost and wander between colonies koleoglu et al 2017 kralj et al 2007 the spread of mites through the bee population can be both vertically which occurs when phoretic mites travel upon the swarming bees and horizontally which occurs when infested brood is moved between colonies by beekeepers or when foragers are robbing honey from other colonies peck et al 2016 availability of brood in the colony is paramount for varroa mites reproduction given that it occurs in capped worker and drone brood cells when a mature female mite foundress enters the cell preceding capping degrandi hoffman et al 2017 rosenkranz et al 2010 the foundress starts feeding on the brood and continues to feed regularly thereafter donze et al 1996 the foundress lays its first egg which develops into a male and the second one into a female mite that mates with the male degrandi hoffman et al 2017 the mother mite keeps feeding on the developing larva and in the process transmits several viruses degrandi hoffman et al 2017 after the bee is fully developed and emerges from the capped cell the mother mite and offspring emerge with it and attach to other adult bees as phoretic mites degrandi hoffman et al 2017 in general phoretic mites target nurse bees cervo et al 2014 del piccolo et al 2010 because they remain in the brood area and serve as a medium to transport mites to brood cells where they can reproduce degrandi hoffman et al 2017 in recent years the population growth rates of varroa have exceeded those expected degrandi hoffman et al 2014 2017 2016 causing this pest to be difficult to control and a major factors in colony losses mathematical models have been powerful tools to help us understand the effects of mites e g kang et al 2016 disease e g kang et al 2016 ratti et al 2012 and pesticides e g magal et al 2019 2020 on honeybee population dynamics there are some models that are introduced to explore the role of mite infestation in honeybee colonies see the work of kribs zaleta and mitchell 2014 messan et al 2017 ratti et al 2012 2015 kang et al kang et al 2016 proposed a honeybee mite virus model that incorporates parasitic interactions between honeybees and varroa mites in addition to a virus transmission dynamics in this study it was found that low adult bees to brood ratios have destabilizing effects on the system can generate fluctuating dynamics and potentially lead to a catastrophic event where both honeybees and mites suddenly become extinct within a colony however kang et al 2016 did not explicitly model the brood population thus omitting the role of brood population size on mite s proliferation becher et al becher et al 2014 constructed an agent based model to explore how various stressors including varroa mites virus infections impaired foraging behavior changes in landscape structure pesticides etc affect the performance of single managed honeybee colonies while the latter work provides valuable results on different mechanisms that may induce the decline of honeybee population in a colony brood population was not taken into account explicitly an another approach studying the effects of varroa mites infestation on honeybees through dispersal mechanisms was done in messan et al 2017 this study contains a complete analysis of local and global dynamics of a two patch model that incorporates mite migration through bees foraging activities the results of this study provide insight on different scenarios where different migration rates can affect the bee population negatively or drive the mite population extinct within the colony however this study lacks focus on the different population dynamics that can arise within a colony from mechanisms such as reproduction and parasitism of mites on brood and adult bees motivated by work of degrandi hoffman et al 1989 messan et al 2017 we propose a single patch stage structure delay differential equation model that considers the time lag from brood to adult bees with parasite mites in seasonal environment the modeling framework used here is inspired by the work of aiello and freedman 1990 in the proposed model we focus on specific mechanisms related to mite reproduction and parasitism effects on the bees life cycle unlike other studies such as some of the ones mentioned earlier our proposed model incorporates individual mechanisms of brood and adult bees and their interactions with mites that give rise to different population dynamics at the colony level we assess the effects of different parameters affecting the population dynamics inside the colony more specifically we aim to use this model to explore how the synergistic effects of age structure and parasitism affect the colony dynamics in seasonal environment the seasonality in our model is reflected through the seasoning varying egg laying rate by the queen bee 2 model derivation let b t h t and m t denote the total population of brood adult honeybees and mites at time t respectively following the schematic diagram in fig 1 our model has the following assumptions let τ 0 be the time interval in which the population entering an homogeneous environment equals to the length of time from egg to fully developed adult bee we assume that all populations are known during the interval τ t 0 more specifically let b 0 t be the observed or assumed egg laying rate of the queen during the time interval τ t 0 the population of adult honeybee h t and mite m t are being constant during the time interval τ t 0 and we denote that h t h 0 and m t m 0 for all time t in τ t 0 our model is derived as follows and takes one form on the interval 0 t τ and a second form on the interval t τ 1 we assume that at any time t 0 the brood population b increases through the successful survivability of an egg into pupae stage represented by the term h 2 k h 2 which incorporates the collaborative efforts of adult workers via division of labor this term assumes that successful colonies produce more brood and efficient workers an assumption supported by eischen et al 1984 kang et al 2016 schmickl and crailsheim 2007 2 the brood adult bee and mite populations are assumed to have a natural average death rate proportional to the existing population denoted with constant parameters d b d h and d m respectively 3 both the brood and adult bee populations decrease through the parasitism effect of mites the probability of mites attaching to brood and adult bees is modeled with the terms b a b and h a h respectively where a is the size of the brood or adult bee population accordingly at which the rate of attachment is half maximal see a similar approach in betti et al 2014 sumpter and martin 2004 the parameters α b and α h measure the parasitism rate of mites on the brood and adult bees respectively 4 the mite population increases through the parasitism effects of brood that aids mite reproduction the work of boot et al 1997 garrido and rosenkranz 2003 steiner et al 1994 suggests that initiation of oocyte development in varroa depends on whether the female enters the brood cells of apis mellifera before operculation thus the term c α b b a b accounts for the production of new mites where c is the conversion factor from brood to mite population the mite equation could hence be described by 1 d m d t c α b b a b d m m 5 the life cycle of the female varroa is normally subdivided into a phoretic phase in which it lives on adult bees and a reproductive phase occurring within worker or drone brood cells thus the two life stages should be modeled explicitly however from the work of kang et al 2016 messan et al 2017 we assume an implicit age structure for the mite population where the ratio of different stages are constant for example consider ξ 0 1 to be the percentage of mites at the non phoretic stage then 1 ξ m is the phoretic mite population let d m d m 1 ξ then the phoretic mite equation becomes d m d t c α b b m a b d m 1 ξ m c α b b m a b d m m similar approach can be followed to find the reproductive mite population and by grouping the reproductive and phoretic mites together we obtain the mite model defined as in 1 6 we assume that eggs laid by the queen at time t τ which survive to time t i e r h t τ 2 k h t τ 2 exit or mature from the brood population b and enter the adult bee population h the survival of the brood depends on their own natural death and if they survive the mite infestation therefore the probability of survival is e t τ t d b α b m s a b s d s when 0 t τ and t τ we follow a similar approach and derivation as in aiello and freedman 1990 and obtain the number of brood that survive into adult bees b 0 t τ e t τ t d b α b m s a b s d s when 0 t τ and r h t τ 2 k h t τ 2 e t τ t d b α b m s a b s d s when t τ 7 for continuity of initial conditions and following a similar approach as in aiello and freedman 1990 the total surviving brood population from the observed eggs laid on τ t 0 is b 0 τ 0 b 0 t d t 0 the model formulated by the assumptions provided above is therefore composed by two time intervals 0 t τ and t τ in the following form for t 0 τ 2 d b d t r h 2 k h 2 egg

from brood parasitism d m m natural death with initial conditions 4 b t b 0 t 0 t τ 0 h 0 0 m 0 0 where b 0 t c c τ 0 0 is the brood population at t τ 0 with these initial conditions our model describes a scenario where mite reproduction and parasitism initiate at time t 0 we note that the age structure of mite population was not taken into account in the next section we compare the dynamics of our proposed model with and without parasite m t to gain insights on the effects of mites 3 mathematical analysis for a starter we provide basic dynamical properties of model 2 3 as follows theorem 3 1 solution b t h t m t of system 2 3 satisfying 4 is positive for all t 0 in addition lim sup t b t h t m t c r min d b d h d m biological implications the existence and uniqueness of our model 2 3 follows directly from theorem 3 1 in smith smith 2011 thus it is omitted in our analysis theorem 3 1 implies that model 2 3 is well defined biologically in terms of its solution being positive invariant and bounded 1 solution being positive invariant refers to that the population will never become negative when its initial population is positive or zero and 2 solution being bounded refers to that population has its capacity and will not grow infinity due to unlimited resources 3 1 dynamics of honeybees in this subsection we present a summary of the dynamics of the honeybee only system studied in chen et al 2020 when m 0 0 the honeybee mite system 2 3 reduces to the following honeybee only subsystem 5 6 for t 0 τ 5 d b d t r h 2 t k h 2 t d b b t e d b τ b 0 t τ d h d t e d b τ b 0 t τ d h h t for t τ 6 d b d t r h 2 t k h 2 t d b b t e d b τ r h 2 t τ k h 2 t τ d h d t e d b τ r h 2 t τ k h 2 t τ d h h t let 7 h 1 2 r e d b τ 2 d h 1 1 2 d h e d b τ r 2 k with h 1 h 2 hence the subsystem 5 6 has two interior equilibria e i b i h i with 8 b i 1 d b 1 e d b τ r h i 2 k h i 2 d h e d b τ 1 d b h i i 1 2 based on the work of chen et al chen et al 2020 the dynamical results of the subsystem 5 6 are summarized as follows also see table 1 1 the extinction equilibrium e e 0 0 of the subsystem 5 6 always exists and is always locally asymptotically stable 2 if r d h 2 e d b τ k the subsystem 5 6 has global stability at the extinction equilibrium e e 3 if r d h 2 e d b τ k the subsystem 5 6 has a unique interior equilibrium e b h r 1 e d b τ 2 d b k which is always locally asymptotically stable for any delay τ 0 4 if r d h 2 e d b τ k the subsystem 5 6 has two attractors the extinction equilibrium e e and the interior equilibrium e 2 b 2 h 2 which are locally asymptotically stable results from section 3 1 indicate that in the absence of parasitic mite colonies are left with adult honeybee and brood the survival of colony is determined by the values of r e d b τ d h and 2 k note that r e d b τ d h r e d b τ the survived brood that becomes honeybee adult 1 d h the average life span of honeybee adult and let 2 k be the critical honeybee adult population that the brood survival could be maximum then the colony can survive if the average total honeybee adult population during its life time r e d b τ d h is larger than the critical honeybee adult population 2 k alternatively we could also expect that the larger the natural death rate of adult bee more likely survival of the colony 3 2 dynamics of the full system first we look at the equilibria of model 2 3 by setting d b d t d h d t d m d t 0 we obtain the subsequent equations 9a r h 2 k h 2 α b b m a b d b b r h 2 k h 2 e d b α b m a b τ 0 9b 2 c m r h 2 k h 2 e d b α b m a b τ α h h m a h d h h 0 9c 2 c m c α b b m a b d m m 0 from eqs 9a 9c we know that if τ 0 then system 2 3 has only the trivial boundary equilibrium e 000 0 0 0 moreover if d h r e d b τ 2 k then model 2 3 has the following two boundary equilibria e b 1 h 1 0 b 1 h 1 0 and e b 2 h 2 0 b 2 h 2 0 where b i and h i i 1 2 are shown in 8 and 7 with h 1 h 2 for the convenience of the reader we show their expressions as follows b i d h e d b τ 1 d b h i and h i e d b τ d b r d b r 2 4 d b 2 d h 2 k e 2 d b τ 2 d b d h the following theorem concerns the stability of these boundary equilibria theorem 3 2 boundary equilibria dynamics model 2 3 always has the extinction equilibrium e 000 which is always locally asymptotically stable if d h r e d b τ 2 k model 2 3 has additionally two boundary equilibria e b 1 h 1 0 and e b 2 h 2 0 where e b 1 h 1 0 is always unstable the equilibrium e b 2 h 2 0 is however locally asymptotically stable when d m c α b b 2 a b 2 and unstable when d m c α b b 2 a b 2 biological implications theorem 3 2 first elucidates the possibility of all populations i e brood adult bee and mite dying out due to the initial population size and thus the existence and local stability of the extinction equilibrium e 000 we point out that c α b b 2 a b 2 c α b successful parasitism rate on brood for mite reproduction b 2 a b 2 the probability of mites attaching to brood is the parasitism on brood that transfers into the mite population thus if the term c α b b 2 a b 2 is less than the mite death rate d m then mite can not survive and the colony is left with brood and adult honeybee by comparing the local stability condition of the equilibrium e b 2 h 2 0 of model 2 3 to the local stability condition of the equilibrium e b 2 h 2 of model 5 6 see table 1 it implies that parasitism with smaller mortality rates e g d m c α b b 2 a b 2 can destabilize the full system such that e b 2 h 2 0 becomes unstable the destabilization due to the introduction of parasites m into the honeybee colony has been observed in our model s simulations as well see fig 2 in the next section the next theorem focuses on the global stability of the extinction equilibrium e 000 of model 2 3 theorem 3 3 global stability of full system 2 3 if d h r e d b τ 2 k and d m c α b the extinction equilibrium e 000 0 0 0 is globally asymptotically stable biological implications theorem 3 3 indicates that when the average total honeybee adult population during its life time r e d b τ d h is less than the critical honeybee adult population 2 k and the natural death rate of the mite population d m is larger than the efficiency of parasitism on brood for mite reproduction α b i e d m c α b then all population i e brood adult honeybee and mite will die out independently of their initial population size thus the large mortality rate of honeybees d h and mites d m can lead to the colony collapsing next we focus on the existence of interior equilibria of model 2 3 that could lead to colony survival model 2 3 has no interior equilibria when τ 0 therefore the existence of interior equilibria requires the delay τ 0 our aim is to find sufficient conditions such that model 2 3 has interior equilibria that can lead to the survival of the honeybee colony to begin our analysis note that from eq 9c b a c α b d m 1 0 that is the inequality c α b d m 1 is required then using eqs 9a and 9b we obtain follows 10 r h 2 k h 2 α b b m a b d b b α h h m a h d h h let f 1 h r h 2 k h 2 and f 2 h b α b m a b d b 1 e α b m a b d b τ where b b m r h 2 k h 2 d b b d h h α h h a h α b b a b and 11 q h d h h

existence of an interior equilibrium of model 2 3 is provided in the following theorem theorem 3 4 existence of interior equilibria let a α b α h c k r d b d h d m and τ be positive parameters assume c α b d m 1 d h r b d b 3 k and q h 2 c 0 then q h has two positive roots h 1 r and h 2 r h 1 r h 2 r and model 3 has at least one interior equilibria e b h m b h m with b a c α b d m 1 when τ β 1 β 2 where β 1 1 d b ln f 1 h 2 r f 1 h 2 r b d b β 2 1 d b ln f 1 h 1 r f 1 h 1 r b d b in addition if d h is sufficiently small such that d h r b d b 2 r b d b 3 k r b d b 3 d b k b then q h 2 c 0 biological implications theorem 3 4 implies that when the ratio of the mites reproduction efficiency to their death rate is sufficiently large i e c α b d m a d b r r 1 and the queen s egg production is adequately large satisfying r d b b model 2 3 may have no interior equilibrium i e either all species die out or the colony is left with brood and adult honeybees unless the conditions q h 2 c 0 f 2 h 1 f 1 h 1 and f 2 h 2 f 1 h 2 are satisfied in which case a unique interior equilibrium emerges i e brood adult honeybees and mites are present in the colony the expressions of the interior equilibria are very complex to obtain analytical solutions thus we seek help from numerical simulations to explore the stability of the interior equilibria 4 numerical results 4 1 effects of parasitism in this section we focus on the dynamical effects of parasitism and seasonality on colony survival to explore the effects of parasites m we compare the typical long term dynamics of system 2 3 when m 0 0 and m 0 0 through simulations fig 2 shows that 1 when m 0 0 the honeybee colony has equilibrium dynamics and the colony can survive while 2 when m 0 1 we can see that both honeybees and mites coexist through oscillating dynamics thus we could deduce that the introduction of mites i e m 0 can have a destabilizing effect on the system and produce fluctuating dynamics of the honeybee population brood and adult bees and mites when the time delay τ is large enough for these simulations we are using τ 21 which corresponds to the time it takes for an egg to become an adult bee we would like to point out that varying α b i e parasitism rate on brood has a potential to destabilize the dynamics thus drive the population through oscillating dynamics see figs 12 and 13 in appendix b long term dynamics of model 2 3 with m 0 and m 0 effects of delay with parasitism from theorem 3 4 we can confirm that there is a unique interior equilibrium when we choose parameter values r 1500 k 95000000 d b 0 051 d h 0 0121 d m 0 027 α b 0 024 α h 0 8 c 1 9 a 8050 we take initial conditions b 0 t b 0 0 h 0 9000 and m 0 3 and vary the maturation time τ 0 26 in fig 3 then we have the following dynamics with τ 15 e b h m 11 685 5 16 727 2 579 905 stable equilibrium see fig 3 a c with τ 21 e b h m 11 685 5 12 102 5 338 558 periodic solutions see fig 3 d f with τ 26 e b h m 11 685 5 10 607 8 189 793 unstable equilibrium see fig 3 g i these simulations suggest that as τ increases 0 τ 16 the interior equilibrium is asymptotically stable with our choice of parameter values above then for 16 τ 26 the system has periodic solutions which could be due to a possible hopf bifurcation lastly for τ 26 the interior equilibrium becomes unstable with a large oscillating cycle that hits the stable manifold of the extinction equilibrium e 000 such that both honeybee and mite populations die out delay effects on model 2 3 long term dynamics 4 2 seasonality and parameter estimation the number of eggs laid by the queen bee can be predicted as a function of the ambient temperature photoperiod and adult population in the colony degrandi hoffman et al 1989 in addition it has also been shown that the total number of eggs laid daily by the queen is a decreasing function of the number of days the queen has been laying eggs degrandi hoffman et al 1989 given that the number of eggs laid by the queen is temperature and photoperiod dependent i e changed seasonally the egg laying rate must hence be described by a periodic function it is well known that any periodic function can be represented as an infinite sum of sines and cosines feng et al 2011 in order to keep our model simple and tractable we combined these factors i e temperature photoperiod etc and adapted the first order harmonic function presented in feng et al 2011 to the constant egg laying rate r we define r 1 t to be the time dependent egg laying rate at time t of a full mated queen 12 r 1 t r 1 c o s 2 π t φ 365 where φ denote the day of the year with the maximum egg laying rate r is the baseline egg laying rate from eberl et al 2010 sumpter and martin 2004 and t is the time measured in days therefore the expression in our model 2 3 representing the egg production is modified to r 1 t h t 2 k h t 2 and the eggs laid by the queen at time t τ which survive to time t is now represented by r 1 t τ h t τ 2 k h t τ 2 model 2 3 with a constant egg laying rate r is a model without seasonality and by modifying the egg laying rate to the harmonic function in eq 12 we introduced seasonality the parameters φ and r were estimated by fitting the eq 12 to a one year simulated data of the number of eggs laid per day from the beepop model degrandi hoffman et al 1989 see fig 4 all parameter estimations were conducted using the findfit function from mathematica 11 2 to compute the best least squares fit in order to estimate parameters α b α h and a in the model with and without seasonality we first estimated the brood adult honeybee and mite population size per colony from field data provided by degrandi hoffman degrandi hoffman et al 2016 the data were collected at the university of arizona west agricultural facility 20 colonies the colonies were established in desert climate of arizona where temperatures are favorable for bees foraging activity especially from april through november when the data were collected all colonies initially were broodless and had 9000 bees with a laying queen a miticide treatment was applied to control the varroa population at the beginning of the experiment april of 2014 in order to approximate the adult honeybee and brood population sizes in the colonies frames of bees were measured monthly from may to november using a method from degrandi hoffman et al 2008 this method consist of estimating brood and adult bees on an area of the frames using a 5 cm 5 cm grid which covers the entire side of the comb note that one frame of bees contains approximately 2506 bees and 5200 brood cells degrandi hoffman et al 2008 and at most only 80 of frames are cover with brood thus each colony of adult bees is estimated by computing the number of frames of adult bees 2506 and a colony of brood is estimated as the number of frames of brood 0 8 5200 the varroa mite population density in the colonies were also collected from may until november during the experiment season i e may to november 300 bees were brushed into a jar then the number of mites on the 300 bees were counted monthly and these constitute the phoretic mites the population of the reproductive mites was also estimated by counting the total number of mites per sampled cells the total mite population in a colony is hence the sum of the phoretic and reproductive mite we proceeded as follow to find the estimated mite population in colonies recall that the number of phoretic mites obtained is the mites per 300 bees then the phoretic mite population size per colony was estimated by mites per 300 bees 300 population of bees per colony we calculated the reproductive mites per colony by multiplying total number of mites 5200 number of cells sampled in degrandi hoffman et al 2016 the authors followed a similar approach to estimate the population size of brood adult bees and mites per colony using varroa mites and honeybee life history parameters in the ranges provided in table 2 we estimated the parameters α b α h a without considering seasonality α b 0 045 α h 0 49 and a 8500 and in the presence of seasonality α b 0 0447 α h 0 8 and a 8050 by fitting the model to the data when the egg laying rate r is constant and when r is the harmonic function described in eq 12 respectively to illustrate the importance of seasonality when modeling the dynamics of honeybee and mite populations we present the best fit without seasonality in figs 5 and the best fit with seasonality in figs 6 using the egg laying rate function in 12 best fit without seasonality best fit with seasonality comparisons between the best fit of the model with and without seasonality figs 5 and 6 1 a better fit of the model simulation to the data is obtained when seasonality is taken into account in fig 6 as oppose to fig 5 this reflects a more realistic life history parameters of honeybees and mites as presented in fig 6 2 the parameter values used for both with and without seasonality model 2 3 produce the following equilibrium points e 000 0 0 0 e b 1 h 1 0 24171 20930 2 0 e b 2 h 2 0 1931 15 1672 22 0 we highlight that under these parameter values the sufficient conditions in theorem 3 4 for the existence of interior equilibrium are not satisfied thus there is no interior point according to theorem 3 2 e 000 and e b 1 h 1 0 are asymptotically stable while e b 2 h 2 0 is unstable given initial conditions in the simulations shown in fig 5 a and b honeybee and mite populations go extinct as t however for other initial conditions we could have the survival of only the honeybee 3 the population of brood and adult bees are driven extinct without seasonality in approximately 350 days while mite population in approximately 500 days this is an unrealistic situation as the mite population cannot outlive the colony population but rather should die with the colonie with seasonality all populations went extinct in approximately 600 days this result first indicates that including seasonality provides a more realistic scenario on the modeling of brood bee mite interaction in addition the environmental changes due to seasonality could promote a longer survival of honeybee colony infested by the varroa mites this highlights the effects of seasonal fluctuation on survivability of species 4 in the presence of seasonality the population of brood adult bee and mites tend to have a second rise after approximately one year and this is due to the resumption of egg laying rate by the queen in the late winter as illustrated in fig 4 see the second peak starting in february 24 effects of infestation rate on brood population α b and seasonality in appendix b we provide comparison on the role of α b on the population dynamics of brood adult bee and mite in figs 7 12 fig0013 14 those simulations show time series simulations and comparison of the dynamics with and without seasonality under different α b values for these simulations parameters were chosen such that a unique interior equilibrium exists and is locally stable for the smallest value of α b i e when the unique interior equilibrium is stable without seasonality and α b 0 022 taking seasonality into account causes the mite population to die out while the adult bee population stabilizes and the brood population fluctuates fig 7 an intermediate value of α b 0 024 has the potential to generate fluctuating dynamics without seasonality while only the mite population dies out when seasonality is considered fig 12 in the presence of seasonality a larger α b i e 0 027 has the potential to drive the brood adult bee and mite through non periodic dynamics while all populations die out without seasonality fig 13 a large value of α b 0 028 has the ability to drive colonies to collapse irrespective of seasonality fig 14 while colonies can collapse under large α b and in the absence of control measure the results presented in fig 14 show that all populations die out before the third year 1000 th day when seasonality is not taken into account populations persist over four years when seasonality is included such result highlights the importance of considering seasonality when modeling the population dynamics of honeybees colonies infested with varroa mite 4 3 sensitivity analysis data fitting and parameter estimation with and without seasonality of α b α h and a are provided in section 4 2 using colonies data from degrandi hoffman et al 2008 see fig 5 for fitting without seasonality and fig 6 for fitting with seasonality and all other parameters sources are listed in table 2 it is often noted in mathematical biology that natural variation error in measurements may cause a variation in the parameter of the system marino et al 2008 thus identifying critical input parameters of a model and quantifying how the uncertainty of such parameters impact model outcome is paramount this section measures and quantifies the effect of parameter sensitivity on the population size of brood adult bee and mite respectively through global sensitivity analysis sa as noted by marino et al 2008 different sa techniques will perform better for specific types of mathematical and computational models there have been numerous global sensitivity methods discussed in the literature for a detailed review on monte carlo analysis and variance decomposition methods see cacuci and ionescu bujor 2004 iman and helton 1988 ionescu bujor and cacuci 2004 saltelli and bolado 1998 however in order to obtain a holistic view regarding the sensitivity of the input parameters on the model outcome two different sa methods were employed 1 the partial rank correlation coefficient prcc sa with latin hypercube sampling or lhs first introduced by mckay et al 1979 as the sampling technique 2 and the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast we followed the methodology discussed in marino et al 2008 for both sa methods i e lhs prcc and efast for our analysis sa was conducted on the time corresponding to the largest population size in fig 6 as output and the eleven parameters of model 2 3 when seasonality is taken into account using the egg laying rate formula 12 the time corresponding to the largest population size was selected to determine how the input parameters might affect the brood adult bee and mite population at their peak thus maintaining or causing the collapse of the colony the results of the sa are presented in figs 8 10 for the brood adult honeybee and mite populations both prcc and efast values in fig 8 indicate that r d b and k are the most sensitive parameters affecting the brood population size with r the maximum queen s egg laying rate being the most sensitive of the three the prcc values of φ and d h in fig 8 b appear to be at the intermediate level 0 5 as shown in table 3 in appendix b the parameters d m α b α h a and c are shown not to have a high sensitivity value in both fig 8 a and b suggesting that the largest brood population size is not sensitive to mite infestation rate but rather the queen s ability to lay eggs which is a function of seasonality age of the queen colony size nutrition etc degrandi hoffman et al 1989 it is observable in figs 9 and 10 that the most sensitive parameters affecting the adult bee and mite populations size from both the prcc and efast indexes are r α b and c moreover the input parameters d b and d m have a high sensitivity to the mite population from both the prcc and efast indexes fig 10 indicating that reduction of the mite mortality through proper control measure may release parasitic pressure on the colony it is significant to point out that the maximum queen s egg laying rate r appears to be the most sensitive parameter affecting the population size of the brood adult honeybees i e the entire colony of honeybees and mites under both prcc and efast sa methods figs 8 9 and 10 these results have been confirmed by degrandi hoffman et al 1989 where the authors stated that the queen s egg laying potential has the greatest effect on colony population size it is also noticeable that the natural mortality of adult bees i e α h is not very sensitive to the brood adult bee and mite populations the sa also reveals that the infestation rate on the brood i e α b may be another important parameter affecting the population size of the colony see high prcc and efast indexes values in table 4 and 5 in appendix b 5 conclusion colonies of honeybees have been declining for over a decade le conte et al 2010 colony losses are due to a combination of stressors hayes jr et al 2008 le conte et al 2010 but the presence of varroa mites has been considered as one of the most important factors degrandi hoffman and curry 2004 van dooremalen et al 2012 genersch et al 2010 guzmán novoa et al 2010 kang et al 2016 messan et al 2017 in this study we proposed a nonlinear stage structure delay differential equations model that describes the interactions between brood adult honeybees and mites in a single patch framework where the maturation from brood to adult honeybees was taken into account moreover noting that the temporal dynamics of honeybee colonies vary with respect to time of year e g temperature photoperiod etc winston 1991 and the effects on the egg laying rate of the queen seasonality was incorporated into our model comparisons are made between simulation predictions with and without seasonality the theoretical results provide insights on how the presence of mites affect population dynamics of the adult honeybee and brood population it follows from our results that initial population size plays an important role in sustaining a healthy bee colony colony size affects egg lay rates and larger colony sizes can rear more brood enabling the population to grow a low natural death rate also contributes to a relatively rapid increase of the bee population the introduction of mites into a healthy colony was shown to have dire effects on the colony growth mites can generate fluctuating dynamics of the colony population i e brood adult bees and mites though the process behind the population oscillation is not completely clear this phenomenon can result in the extinction of the colony kang et al 2016 the delay parameter i e the development time from brood to adult bee can stabilize destabilize or even promote fluctuating dynamics leading to the coexistence or death of all species in this study larger development time combined with mites can destabilize population dynamics that could drive the colony collapsing it was pointed out in puškadija et al 2017 that unfavourable weather conditions after the queen bee starts with intensive oviposition during the early spring may cause an imbalance in the division of tasks among worker bees leading to slow spring development moreover the development time is known to be influenced by climatic conditions and food availability nunes silva et al 2006 possible explanation of the destabilization effect shown in this work due to large development time could hence be a detrimental weather condition seasonality impacts population dynamics most notably due to the effects on the egg laying rate of the queen in our simulations where seasonality is not considered i e when brood rearing does not depend on seasonality there could be stable equilibrium dynamics so that both the colony and mite population coexist at the unique interior equilibrium however under conditions where seasonality is considered no such equilibrium exists and colony collapses in general our simulations that omit seasonal effects on colony dynamics provide unrealistic scenarios where mite population outlives the colony population this unrealistic outcome was expected as mite population size varies from fall to spring as shown in the work of degrandi hoffman et al 2017 degrandi hoffman and curry 2004 and thus illustrating the importance of year round seasonality on predicting the mite population size and its effect on a colony the work of wilkinson and smith 2002 also pointed to the importance of seasonality in the brood adult bee mite dynamics the authors found that seasonal variation in brood rearing of the host honeybees is more important to the mite population growth rate than the reproductive rate of the mite other authors have also emphasized the importance of seasonality for mite population growth see the work of camphor et al 2005 nürnberger et al 2019 ratti et al 2015 sakofski et al 1990 in our work when we incorporated a time periodic dependent parameter in the egg laying ability to simulate the seasonal brood rearing cycle the population predictions aligned well with the actual data and indicated that sensitivity to environmental parameters associated with season is essential for generating realistic brood adult bee mite population scenarios in fact the severe overwintering honeybee population losses discussed by other authors guzmán novoa et al 2010 sakofski et al 1990 has also been observed in our simulations where the growth of the mite population led to the decline of both the brood and adult bee population when seasonality was taken into account the results of our sensitivity analysis from our prcc and efast showed that the queen s egg laying rate has the greatest impact on the colony s population size which supports the work of degrandi hoffman et al 1989 colony size also was sensitive to the mite infestation rate of the brood population this was expected as the infestation by the varroa destructor has been noted to be one of the major stressors of colony decline genersch et al 2010 guzmán novoa et al 2010 rosenkranz et al 2010 our results also illustrated the dynamics generated by the mite to brood infestation rate on the population size with and without seasonality when seasonality is not taken into account small infestation of the brood population could promote coexistence of all species at the interior equilibrium intermediate infestation rate could yield the coexistence of all species through fluctuating dynamics and large infestation rate could drive the colony to collapse however by incorporating seasonality our results showed that mite population could die out under small and large infestation rate but all the populations may go through non periodic dynamics under an intermediate infestation rate on the brood population moreover by comparing the seasonal and non seasonal dynamics our results indicated that in the environment where high seasonal fluctuation is present infested colonies may survive longer than in an environment when small or no fluctuation occurs these findings highlight the importance of seasonality in the honeybee interaction with varroa mite and some of the parameters that may promote a mite free colony or drive the colony to collapse as honeybee population continues to decline understanding the related causes is critical to alleviate this ecological disturbance this study is the first to explicitly model brood adult bee mite interaction and incorporate the development time from brood to adult bee by using a distributed delay our findings revealed the catastrophic effects that mites can have on a healthy colony by illustrating that the large development time from brood to adult bee can have the destabilizing effects on an infested colony i e brood adult bee and mite population this study demonstrates that while colony survival can be threaten by the availability of mites favorable environmental conditions e g weather food resources may promote species coexistence and thus represent complex intertwined ecological processes moreover we elucidated how higher climatic fluctuations could promote longer survivability of brood and adult bees in an infested colony comparing the model with and without seasonality illustrated that incorporating seasonality is viable to simulate realistic honeybee population dynamics seasonality was shown to play a crucial role in the honeybee population cycles and it represents an important component in mathematical models describing the interaction of honeybee and its parasitic varroa mite it will be interesting to study similar dynamics when honeybee population is prone to use a defensive mechanism such as grooming behavior this

showing the positivity of our system first we prove that b t 0 h t 0 m t 0 for all t 0 τ on the contrary we assume that there exists t 0 0 τ such that b t 0 0 and b t 0 for t 0 t 0 then we have from

which is a contradiction since t 0 τ 0 and b 0 t 0 t τ 0 therefore b t 0 for all t 0 τ if there exists t 0 0 τ such that h t 0 0 and h t 0 for t 0 t 0 then h t 0 0 by the second equation of 2 we get a contradiction that 0 h t 0 e t 0 τ t 0 d b α b m s a b s d s b 0 t 0 τ 0 since b 0 t 0 t τ 0 therefore h t 0 for all t 0 τ furthermore the third equation of 2 implies that m t m 0 e 0 t d m c α b b s

we can get by induction that b t 0 h t 0 m t 0 for all t 0 2 we now proceed with the boundedness of our system in below define w c b c h m then we have d w d t c d b d t c d h d t d m d t c r h 2 k h

2020 we proceed with the stability of the boundary equilibria e 000 e b 1 h 1 0 and e b 2 h 2 0 by linearizing our system first we note that e b 1 h 1 0 is unstable since e b 1 h 1 is unstable in the model of chen et al by theorem 3 3 chen et al 2020 so we only consider the stability of e 000 and e b 2 h 2 0 to facilitate our analysis we introduce the variable p t e t τ t d b α b m s a b s d s and

satisfy the following algebraic equation 18 l λ λ d h 2 r k h k h 2 2 e λ d b τ 0 therefore the stability of e 000 and e b 2 h 2 0 is determined by the signs of λ 2 and of the roots of l λ 0 at extinction equilibrium e 000 0 0 0 λ 2 d m and l λ λ d h therefore e 0 0 0 is locally asymptotically stable for all τ 0 at e b 2 h 2 0 form the proof of theorem 3 3 in the paper of chen et al chen et al 2020 by theorem 4 7 of smith smith 2011 we know that all roots of l λ have negative real parts thus we can conclude that if d m c α b b a b then e b 2 h 2 0 is locally asymptotically stable while unstable if d m c α b b a b proof of theorem 3 4 proof note that from eq 9c b a c α b d m 1 and from eqs 9a and 9b we obtain r h 2 k h 2 e d b α b m a b τ r h 2 k h 2 α b b m a b d b b r h 2 k h 2 e d

c α b d m 1 0 i e c α b d m 1 h 0 is a positive root of f 1 h f 2 h and m defined in 20 is positive in what follows we assume c α b d m 1 regard m defined in 20 as a function on h denoted as m h we

m h is determined by q h i if r b d b 0 then for all h 0 q h 0 in this case model 3 has no interior equilibria ii let r b d b 0 by q h 3 d h h 2 2 r b d b h d h k we have two cases 1 if δ 4 r b d b 2 12 k d h 2 0 then for all h r q h 0 notice q 0 0 we know that for all h 0 q h 0 this implies that model 3 has no interior equilibria for this case 2 if δ 4 r b d b 2 12 k d h 2 0 i e d h r b d b 3 k then q h has two positive roots h 1 c h 2 c h 1 2 c r d b b r d b b 2 3 k d h 2 3 d h in which h 1 c is the minimum point and h 2 c is the maximum point of q h if q h 2 c 0 then for all h 0 q h 0 and model 3 has no interior equilibria if q h 2 c 0 then q h has exact two positive roots denoted as h 1 r h 2 r satisfying q h 0 for h h 1 r h 2 r and q h 0 for h 0 h 1 r h 2 r thus in order to show the existence of at least one interior equilibria we only need to find a root of f 1 h f 2 h in h 1 r h 2 r note that f 1 h and f 2 h have the following properties a f 1 0 0 lim h f 1 h r and f 1 h is strictly increasing on 0 which implies f 1 h 1 r f 2 h 2 r b lim h 0 f 2 h b τ 0 lim h f 2 h 0 since lim h m h c f 2 h 1 r f 2 h 2 r b d b 1 e τ d b since m h 1 r m h 2 r 0 d by 20 and the fact m h 1 r m h 2 r 0 f 2 h 1 r b d b d h h 1 r f 2 h 2 r b d b d h h 2 r which implies f 2 h 1 r b d b f 2 h 2 r b d b from the properties a and b we can claim that if f 1 h 1 r f 2 h 1 r and f 2 h 2 r f 1 h 2 r illustrated in fig 11 then model 3 has at least one interior equilibrium thus by property c if τ 0 satisfies the inequalities 21 f 1 h 1 r b d b 1 e τ d b f 1 h 2 r then model 3 has at least one interior equilibrium noticing property d and solving 21 we get β 1 τ β 2 where β 1 1 d b ln f 1 h 2 r f 1 h 2 r b d b β 2 1 d b ln f 1 h 1 r f 1 h 1 r b d b therefore if τ β 1 β 2 then model 3 has at least one interior equilibria at last we give a sufficient condition which is easy to be verified such that q h 2 c 0 from the property of cubic function q h we know that it has unique point of inflection h 0 r b d b 3 d h and that if q h 0 0 then q h 2 c 0 by a direct computation we have q h 0 2 r b d b 3 27 d h 2 k r b d b 3 d b k b thus if d h r b d b 2 r b d b 3 k r b d b 3 d b k b then q h 0 0 and hence q h 2 c 0 proof of theorem 3 3 proof by the positivity of solutions of model 2 3 the third equation of 3 implies that d m d t c α b d m m t 0 since c α b d m 1 thus lim t m t 0 then the model reduces to the model of chen et al chen et al 2020 the global stability of e 00 we know that lim t b t lim t h t 0 if d h r e d b τ 2 k the proof is complete appendix b 
24678,both climate change and land use regimes affect the viability of populations but they are often studied separately moreover population viability analyses pvas often ignore the effects of large environmental gradients and use temporal resolutions that are too coarse to take into account that different stages of a population s life cycle may be affected differently by climate change here we present the high resolution large environmental gradient hileg model and apply it in a pva with daily resolution based on daily climate projections for northwest germany we used the large marsh grasshopper lmg as the target species and investigated 1 the effects of climate change on the viability and spatial distribution of the species 2 the influence of the timing of grassland mowing on the species and 3 the interaction between the effects of climate change and grassland mowing the stage and cohort based model was run for the spatially differentiated environmental conditions temperature and soil moisture across the whole study region we implemented three climate change scenarios and analyzed the population dynamics for four consecutive 20 year periods climate change alone would lead to an expansion of the regions suitable for the lmg as warming accelerates development and due to reduced drought stress however in combination with land use the timing of mowing was crucial as this disturbance causes a high mortality rate in the aboveground life stages assuming the same date of mowing throughout the region the impact on viability varied greatly between regions due to the different climate conditions the regional negative effects of the mowing date can be divided into five phases 1 in early spring the populations were largely unaffected in all the regions 2 between late spring and early summer they were severely affected only in warm regions 3 in summer all the populations were severely affected so that they could hardly survive 4 between late summer and early autumn they were severely affected in cold regions and 5 in autumn the populations were equally affected across all regions the duration and start of each phase differed slightly depending on the climate change scenario and simulation period but overall they showed the same pattern our model can be used to identify regions of concern and devise management recommendations the model can be adapted to the life cycle of different target species climate projections and disturbance regimes we show with our adaption of the hileg model that high resolution pvas and applications on large environmental gradients can be reconciled to develop conservation strategies capable of dealing with multiple stressors keywords climate change land use population viability analysis stage based model high resolution environmental gradients 1 introduction in terrestrial ecosystems land use and climate change are two dominant factors driving biodiversity loss millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 the risk of species loss can be estimated using simulation models that support population viability analysis pva in changing environments pvas are used to assess the viability of species and populations as a function of species parameters such as the population growth rate environmental conditions such as food availability and anthropogenic impacts such as the fragmentation and deterioration of habitats beissinger and mccullough 2002 coulson et al 2001 these analyses are of great value in conservation biology to decide where when and how which species should be protected while pvas are widely performed chaudhary and oli 2020 pe er et al 2013 stephens 2016 most of them address small areas build on aggregated demographic rates and use low temporal resolutions e g years in recent years however it has become increasingly clear that three interrelated factors need to be considered in pvas to broaden their scope first a large spatial extent can be important to capture relevant environmental gradients second considering all life stages i e the full life cycle of a species is relevant radchuk et al 2013 because stages respond in different levy et al 2015 or even contrary ways cordes et al 2020 to changes in the environment caused for example by climate change third the high temporal resolution of climate data has proven relevant for improving modeling results radchuk et al 2014 for instance to capture the impact of extreme conditions ma et al 2015 the second and third factors are interrelated as capturing the response of different life stages to external conditions requires high resolution data yet to our knowledge only few studies so far use such highly resolved external drivers especially in combination with spatial gradients and distinguishing different life stages bonnot 2016 green et al 2014 schmidt and zinkernagel 2017 thompson et al 2012 here we present the high resolution large environmental gradient hileg model a spatially differentiated stage and cohort based simulation model that allows us to use daily time steps to mechanistically examine the interrelations between population dynamics and external drivers such as climate and land use the hileg model is designed to be used for different terrestrial animal species by specifying a corresponding set of parameters and external drivers along large environmental gradients we use climate data with a daily temporal resolution and a spatial resolution of 12 12 km² grid cells and that widely cover northwest germany in each climate cell a representative patch of grassland is considered similar to a sensitivity analysis the comparison of the model results for different climate cells allows the exploration of the dependence of population viability on climate change and land use as well as the interaction between the two factors experimental data on the impact of climate parameters such as temperature precipitation and soil moisture on population dynamics are usually scarce and uncertain which is also the case in the present study the output of the model simulations is thus too uncertain to make quantitative predictions on the future development or viability of a target species however relative predictions and comparative analyses are usually robust to data uncertainty drechsler et al 2003 mccarthy and possingham 2014 for example if they address the influence of an environmental factor on the ranking of habitats or land use measures with regard to their suitability for a species the present pva is such a relative analysis as a first application we parametrized the hileg model for the well studied large marsh grasshopper lmg stethophyma grossum in cultivated grasslands of northwest germany and simulated its population dynamics for the years 2000 2079 given different climate change scenarios and schedules for grassland mowing the lmg prefers wet meadows and marshes as habitats while its life stages are affected differently by climate conditions and the timing of grassland mowing warm temperatures accelerate hatching and larva development while spring and autumn droughts degrade eggs located below ground mowing is highly lethal for larvae and imagines because they can hardly escape the harvesters the lmg is partly considered threatened in the federal states of northwest germany winkler 2000 and therefore of high relevance for local conservation agencies while recent studies project this species will benefit from elevated temperatures caused by climate change poniatowski et al 2018 trautner and hermann 2008 they state that extended droughts and anthropogenic disturbances such as mowing and grazing depending on their timing can still pose a threat to its survival löffler et al 2019 poniatowski et al 2018 our model allows simulating the combined effects of different scenarios of climate change and mowing schedules on lmg population dynamics therefore it helps to evaluate possible conservation measures by assessing how the timing of grassland mowing can be altered to adapt to climate induced shifts in the lmg life cycle to this end the model considers temporal changes and spatial heterogeneity in essential climate variables in principle our model is also able to consider spatial heterogeneity in other factors such as habitat size food competitors predators and land use however the aim of the model is not to investigate real land use patterns with spatially heterogeneous mowing dates or other heterogeneous features in the study region rather our model aims to solve the problem of coupling high resolution climate data into a demographic model and investigating how the dynamics of local lmg populations are affected by the locally changing climate and selected mowing schedules specifically the following questions are addressed 1 how do population density and viability shift regionally given different climate change scenarios 2 which mowing schedule has the least negative impact on the overall population density and viability in the study region 3 does the mowing impact severity depend on the spatial location with its specific climate 2 material and methods our case study involves four main components the study region northwest germany and the surrounding areas the target species lmg climate data projections until 2080 and land use grassland mowing these components are described in the following subsections furthermore the hileg model which simulates the interplay between these components is introduced in section 2 6 2 1 study region the study region is northwest germany and the surrounding areas fig 1 for which climate projections were available section 2 3 more precisely those regions are the federal states of schleswig holstein lower saxony hamburg and bremen as well as surrounding areas of germany denmark and the netherlands the spatial resolution of the grid cells areas of 12 12 km2 yields 968 terrestrial grid cells within the study region 2 2 target species the lmg s grossum linné 1758 is a well studied locust species that is widely distributed in central european grass and wetlands heydenreich 1999 though the grasshopper itself tolerates a wide range of temperatures and humidity the high water demand of its eggs restricts the lmg to wet habitats such as meadows and marshes ingrisch and köhler 1998 koschuh 2004 during a year it develops through three consecutive life stages fig 2 which often overlap to some degree within a population 1 egg embryo typical timing between july and june of the following year below ground 2 larval may october above ground 3 imago july october above ground heydenreich 1999 ingrisch and köhler 1998 kleukers et al 1997 köhler and weipert 1991 malkus 1997 marshall and haes 1988 oschmann 1969 stage 1 goes through additional development phases that are included in our model the embryo development inside the egg is interrupted by a diapause to prevent too early development under rather good conditions and an extended cold period is needed to break this diapause furthermore for ideal development the eggs need to be exposed to contact water before and after winter ingrisch 1983 i e they must be covered with water or lie in moist soil similar to other locusts the lmg is regarded as an indicator for the quality of grassland habitats báldi and kisbenedek 1997 heydenreich 1999 keller et al 2012 keßler et al 2012 it is considered threatened in parts of the study region e g according to the red lists for schleswig holstein winkler 2000 and germany blab et al 1984 maas et al 2002 to our knowledge more recent lists are not available the climate conditions within the lmg s habitat have different implications for population development warm temperatures accelerate embryo hatching in spring wingerden et al 1991 and larval development during summer ingrisch and köhler 1998 uvarov 1977 a sustained dry upper soil layer depth of 2 10 cm before and after winter causes drought stress during egg embryo development ingrisch 1983 considering both factors in terms of climate change there are two implications for the lmg on the one hand increasing temperatures might be beneficial because the accelerated species development could lead to larger population densities and therefore promote dispersal to new habitats poniatowski et al 2018 trautner and hermann 2008 on the other hand extended droughts could threaten hygrophilous species like the lmg löffler et al 2019 especially if they occur during spring or autumn by inhibiting egg and embryo development mowing is particularly harmful during the aboveground phase as larvae and imagines can hardly escape the harvesters and are mostly killed malkus 1997 marzelli 1997 eggs and embryos however are only mildly affected by the mechanical soil disturbances of harvesters therefore extensive grassland mowing with 1 2 cuts during the belowground phase i e early or late in the year is not considered problematic it can even benefit the lmg by maintaining the grasshopper s favored microclimate in an open and heterogeneous vegetation structure malkus 1997 miller and gardiner 2018 sonneck et al 2008 to limit complexity other factors of grassland suitability such as vegetation structure or food availability are not included in this study and are instead considered ideal for lmg development 2 3 climate data the climate data are taken from high resolution scenario simulations generated by the regional climate model cosmo clm 1 1 consortium for small scale modeling in climate mode cclm4 8 17 introduced by keuler et al 2016 for our study this regional model was driven at its lateral boundaries by simulation results of the global model ichec 2 2 irish centre for high end computing ec earth and three representative concentration pathways rcps rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 these pathways represent potential climate developments with different global warming rates for the 21st century the number indicates the equivalent of additional radiative forcing in w m 2 van vuuren et al 2011 of the increasing greenhouse gas concentrations by the year 2100 hereafter the climate change scenarios will be distinguished by action taken towards reducing co2 emissions full force ff rcp2 6 moderate mod rcp4 5 and business as usual bau rcp8 5 the regional model provides time series of daily climate data values mean or sum that are spatially resolved to grid cells of size 12 12 km2 common in such regional models these cells are located in a rotated pole grid coordinate system cosmo clm only provides a single climate projection per global model rcp and grid cell that would have limited hileg to deterministic time series within a climate change scenario to mitigate this limitation for the stochastic model processes section 2 5 we resampled the climate time series per replicate run by randomly rearranging the years without losing the long term trend see supplements s2 and s4 section 5 from the available data we used time series for the years 1995 2080 with the regional model providing simulated data from 2006 onwards only the data before 2006 are readings of actual meteorological values we considered three climate parameters relevant for the lmg population dynamics as implemented in our model surface temperature ts c contact water cw kg m 2 and relative humidity upper ground rhug parameter ts is explicitly calculated by the climate model described below and simply referred to as temperature hereafter the parameters cw and rhug are deduced from other provided time series see supplement s1 they were established because a sufficient amount of contact water and humidity in the upper soil layer is relevant for the lmg egg development as described by ingrisch 1983 throughout the model cw and rhug are used in combination and are therefore referred to by the joint term humidity hereafter additionally we introduced the parameter relative soil moisture content rsmc hereafter referred to as soil moisture it is a representation of the parameter total soil moisture content mrso kg m 2 calculated by the climate model divided by its yearly maximum values soil moisture and humidity are correlated parameters as both depend on mrso see supplement s1 equations s1 2 s1 7 and s1 10 in our analysis we mainly focus on soil moisture for reasons of simplicity it is closer to parameters considered by stake holders e g total soil moisture precipitation than the more abstract parameter humidity in terms of our model and is thus easier to comprehend together with the parameter temperature projections of soil moisture for the years 2000 2080 are given in fig 3 their spatial distributions in the study region are shown in fig 5 2 4 land use anthropogenic influence on the model species is represented by mechanical mowing as a scheduled grassland use measure it is executed uniformly over the whole study region once per year at the beginning of the same calendar week mowing day within our model mowing has a solely negative effect on the model species but with different severities for the below and aboveground populations other indirect effects of mowing are not included in the model see section 2 2 2 5 simulation output for each simulation scenario we generated fifty replicate runs using different random seeds to account for stochasticity section 2 6 table 3 to assess and compare the suitability of different regions for population viability under different scenarios we focused on two output values per grid cell the mean population density referred to as mean density hereafter over the full simulation duration and all replicates and the mean population lifetime referred to as mean lifetime hereafter over all replicates note that the maximum duration of simulation runs limits the lifetime to 20 years in our analysis values close to 20 years hint at population survival over the whole simulation duration in most or all replicates and thus hint at good conditions for longer persistence as well 2 6 model description a full model description following the odd overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2020 2006 is provided in supplement s4 here we provide a summary odd grimm et al 2020 which includes the models overall rationale an overview of the entities and processes and verbal descriptions of the key processes in the following odd keywords are in italics and capitals the hileg model is applied to the life cycle of the lmg whose life stages are affected by climate and land use climate conditions affect development and mortality while land use mowing events induces additional mortality especially during the aboveground phase by its present parameterization the model is nonspatial in the sense that the local lmg populations do not interact with each other spatial heterogeneity in land use and biotic variables such as habitat size are ignored however the essential climate variables are spatially differentiated to apply the model to spatial gradients in climate change scenarios covering northwest germany and the surrounding regions fig 1 the purpose of the model is to answer the following questions 1 how do the population density and lifetime shift regionally given different climate change scenarios 2 which mowing schedule has the least negative impact on the overall population density and viability in the study region 3 does the mowing impact severity depend on the spatial location with its specific climate the empirical patterns used to ensure that the model is sufficiently realistic for its purpose are the observed features of the life cycle and their sensitivity to environmental conditions which were taken from the literature these patterns were used for the model s design the model output in terms of the population structures densities and persistence were not compared to other data as such data are sparse therefore all model predictions are relative not absolute the model was implemented in c the source code of the model implementation the executable program and the input files used for the simulations runs are available via a gitlab repository 3 3 hileg gitlab repository https git ufz de leins hileg the model has the following entities grid cells defining environmental conditions and population per grid cell comprised of life stages which are comprised of age distinguished cohorts flows are auxiliary entities that manage the density transfer between life stages or their loss through mortality table 1 provides an overview of the model s entities and their state variables the lmg develops through three main life stages during a year section 2 2 following ingrisch 1983 and wingerden et al 1991 we divided the egg embryo stage into prediapause diapause and postdiapause development called embryo hereafter to account for the clutch s different susceptibility to climate conditions in autumn winter and spring this subdivision yields five life stages 1 prediapause 2 diapause 3 embryo 4 larva and 5 imago stages 1 to 3 occur below ground and stages 4 and 5 occur above ground furthermore stages 2 and 4 can have multiple cohorts to account for survival over several years in case of conditions during winter that are unsuitable for development and to account for different temperature driven development speeds depending on the hatching date the transition between different life stages is complex because the development and or mortality of cohorts and life stages depends on their previous state and is influenced by climate conditions temperature humidity flows are therefore used to collect all the contributions of all the cohorts of a certain life stage that completed development and therefore flow to the next life stage in the case of mortality a flow determines the amount of density lost by a life stage and its cohorts the model uses daily time steps here scale also reflects the sampling of the climate data however the single mowing event per year is considered on a weekly basis the first day of a calendar week to account for this weekly frequency a year has 364 days by definition resulting in exactly 52 full calendar weeks simulations were run for 20 years 7280 time steps or stopped earlier for a local population in the case of extinction the study region comprises 1296 36 36 grid cells each having an area of 144 km² 12 km x 12 km which corresponds to the resolution of the climate input data fig 1 in total 968 grid cells are terrestrial and therefore belong to the model domain within a grid cell a single habitat is considered which represents a virtual grassland plot with a size of 6 25 ha 250 m x 250 m grid cells and hence habitats are not connected i e there is no exchange of individuals if populations become extinct there is no recolonization the model is initialized with a starting date simulated duration mowing day and climate change scenario table 2 additionally each population receives an initial density per life stage i e 1000 eggs in the diapause stage zero density for the other life stages the carrying capacity individuals m 2 for the aboveground population i e the larva and imago life stages only is assumed to be identical for all the grid cells to reduce the number of confounding factors in the model analysis we used the four 20 year time intervals 2000 2019 abbreviated to 2000 19 hereafter 2020 39 2040 59 and 2060 79 to track changes for past and future climate conditions time series of climate data per grid cell are used as input data which drives the model s dynamics table 3 provides an overview of the model s processes each life stage has its own set of processes the basic rationale of the model is to assume a daily base rate for all processes which represents benign or observed average environmental conditions this base rate is then modified influenced by environmental drivers our model includes predefined functions or equations called influences that may be applied under certain environmental conditions the equations used to represent the influences and their parameterization as applied to the target species are listed in supplement s4 tables s4 4 and s4 5 generally each influence provides a factor that can mediate the effect of environmental conditions on the variables dynamic flow rate and development progress of a flow or cohort respectively in each time step and for every grid cell four main blocks of processes are scheduled update environmental drivers flow update life stage update and cohort update the first three blocks are scheduled one after the other while cohort update is executed as a submodel of life stage update during flow update the flow s state variables table 1 total flow amount current flow amount and dynamic flow rate are calculated from the contributions of cohorts state variables including the effects of environmental influences the submodel life stage update then calculates a life stage s gain from the incoming transfer flow of its preceding life stage and its density from the density of its subordinate cohorts gain is used to determine whether to create a new cohort from it or add it to an existing cohort densities of the subordinate cohorts are determined by the submodel cohort update before they are added to the life stage s density furthermore cohorts that exceed the maximum age before progressing to the next life stage or whose density falls below a certain minimum are removed during cohort update a cohort s density is changed by adding the potential gain determined by the life stage update submodel and subtracting loss through mortality or the outgoing transfer flow additionally some cohorts develop only if environmental conditions are suitable so their development progress is updated accordingly figure 4 provides an overview of the model s entities the processes and their interactions via flows and influences 3 results the results presented here are subdivided into three sections 1 patterns and trends found in the climate data that are relevant to the lmg section 3 1 2 analysis of the hileg model output stemming from simulations with climate as only external driver section 3 2 and 3 analysis of the simulation runs with mowing as an additional anthropogenic impact on the lmg section 3 3 since the results are complex as they cover large environmental gradients and detailed effects of environmental drivers on the study species in the following the main results are also directly discussed in terms of the underlying mechanism note that the model output occasionally reaches densities close to the population s carrying capacity which in reality is rarely the case on a large scale within the idealized conditions section 2 2 of our model realization however this behavior is expected and can be considered unproblematic for the analysis because we were focusing on the relative impacts of climate change and land use on population development rather than those of density dependence 3 1 patterns and trends in climate data the different climate projections showed spatial patterns and temporal trends for the years 2000 to 2079 in terms of temperature and soil moisture note that for reasons of consistency even the past time period 2000 19 consists mostly of simulated data see section 2 3 the coarse spatial patterns for all the climate change scenarios averaged over 20 year periods show that temperature increased slightly from north to south except for two colder mountain regions in the south fig 5 marks 1 2 over time the temperature generally increased similarly in the study region overall the increase was stronger for more severe scenarios with three exceptions first during the simulation period 2000 19 temperatures were more or less identical between the scenarios second for the period 2020 39 the temperature increase was slightly higher for scenario mod than for bau third during the late periods 2040 59 and 2060 79 temperature remained almost constant for scenario ff for soil moisture the patterns were more complex than those of temperature there were four regions of distinctively low soil moisture fig 5 marks 3 6 because these regions have a soil type that seems to favor drought k keuler pers comm cf keuler et al 2016 during the first period 2000 19 the mod and bau scenarios clearly showed lower soil moisture than the ff scenario in almost all the cells and an additional dry region in the southeast fig 5 mark 6 over time however many of those cells improved for the severe bau scenario while degrading for the ff scenario nonetheless the soil moisture for the bau scenario was barely higher than that for the intermediate mod scenario fig 3 overall the spatial patterns in the soil moisture showed the following temporal trends the northwestern dry region expanded over time fig 5 mark 4 some small dry regions appeared in the center of the study region the moisture of the mountain regions increased less than that of their surroundings the edges around the central eastern dry region became wetter and there was a spatial gradient of soil moisture increase in the southeast and decrease in the northwest on a monthly basis the climate parameters generally followed the trends in the yearly averages cf fig 3 data not shown for all the climate change scenarios and time periods the temperature usually reached its minimum around january and its maximum around july with gradual changes between these months the soil moisture was lowest in september and gradually increased to its maximum in march before constantly decreasing again an important exception from this general pattern appeared in the bau scenario during the period 2060 79 fig 6 the monthly soil moisture values deviated from the yearly trend such that june to october were especially dry while november to may were wetter than usual this finding indicates a severe and possibly extended dry season that could not be detected by examining only the yearly mean values 3 2 climate change impact on lmg the results of the hileg model confirm that without direct anthropogenic influence the lmg mostly benefits from climate change in northwest germany within each climate change scenario there was a clear upward trend from 2000 to 2059 for both the mean density and lifetime fig 7 for the last simulation period 2060 79 there was a saturation yielding results similar to that of 2040 59 comparing the climate change scenarios within the same simulation periods the mean results were quite similar except for differences between the ff scenario and the other two scenarios in the period 2060 79 fig 7 the scenarios led to similar spatial patterns in the mean density and lifetime within the same time period but also created certain subtle differences fig 8 first the population conditions improved over time in initially unsuitable areas such as cold mountain regions and dry regions cf fig 5 marks 1 5 an exception was 2060 79 when compared to the previous simulation period 2040 59 here the ff climate change scenario had negative effects on the mean densities and lifetimes in most of the cells the mod scenario showed almost no changes compared to the previous time period the bau scenario yielded improvements outside the dry regions but had negative effects within these dry regions comparing these spatially resolved model results to the climate data showed that they reflect the temperature patterns high temperatures support population development while colder regions notably reduce the mean density and lifetime fig 5 marks 1 2 recurrent significantly colder years fig 3a 2060 79 ff minima can inhibit the positive long term effect of warm temperatures fig 8 2060 79 ff the soil moisture patterns however are less perceptible though population development was clearly hindered in the main dry regions fig 5 marks 3 5 during the simulation period 2000 19 the mean lifetime increased significantly starting in 2020 the mean density in these regions however remained limited compared to those in the surrounding areas another pattern connected to soil moisture is the strong negative effect of an extended dry season fig 6 on populations in most dry regions during the period 2060 79 for the bau scenario fig 8 green areas in the bottom right subplots the peaks in the mountain regions remained mostly uninhabitable for the lmg throughout all the simulations as these areas stayed relatively cold fig 5 marks 1 2 in these regions the population declined almost constantly and went extinct after a few years this phenomenon is due to the impact of the overall lower temperatures on the lmg s development and mortality first it slowed down the development of the embryos and larval cohorts second the temperature threshold of increased larva and imago mortality occurred earlier in the year third the decelerated development additionally shifted larva and imago occurrence to a later hence even colder season of the year departing from the mountain peaks the conditions for the lmg gradually improved allowing a longer lifetime at first and increasing the population density thereafter the time lag in population development between the warm and cold cells shown in fig 11b mark a illustrates such a temperature induced shift in the life cycle low soil moisture had a negative impact on the lmg if the dry season had already started in late spring or lasted until autumn in these cases either the embryos spring or the prediapause eggs autumn experienced drought stress within the study region extinction by drought was mainly caused by the latter i e if a cell still had dry soil after oviposition fig 11b mark b increased embryo mortality through drought stress in spring usually did not lead to extinction but minimized the mean density the reoccurrence of conditions unfavorable to the lmg in the period 2060 79 for the bau climate change scenario was due to climate projections for this scenario though the notably higher temperatures led to favorable conditions in large parts of the study region a strongly extended dry season in the central areas had considerable negative effects on the mean densities and lifetimes fig 8 green areas in the bottom right subplots as a result the overall mean density and lifetime increased while their larger variations fig 7 reflected the low values in the dry areas 3 3 impact of grassland mowing in addition to climate change the extent of the negative influence of grassland mowing on the lmg life cycle was highly dependent on the calendar week in which it occurred fig 9 while mowing during spring and late autumn barely affected the mean lifetime it severely reduced the mean density if it occurred in summer and early autumn this result was independent of the climate change scenario and simulation period however due to the positive effect of higher temperatures in future scenarios the time windows of negative impact both shifted and shortened late mowing after week 33 became less detrimental while early mowing before week 26 had only a slightly more negative effect fig 9 mod and bau scenarios the spatial distribution of the mowing dependent mean lifetime revealed regional differences between the effects of mowing timing fig 10 in particular the periods of negative mowing impact did not apply to all regions in the same way fig 10 illustrates these differences using simulation period 2060 79 of the bau climate change scenario as an example apart from an overall negative effect of mowing on the lmg populations compare fig 10b c to fig 10a conditions for the lmg gradually degraded from north to south when mowing occurred early fig 10b moreover within the southern mountain regions the conditions remained relatively stable despite early mowing and stood out compared to their surroundings fig 10b however both patterns were inverted when mowing occurred late fig 10c in this case conditions gradually improved from north to south and were rather unsuitable within the mountain regions finally as a side effect the negative influence of mowing was generally stronger in the dry regions than in the wet regions especially for late mowing fig 10c note that mowing in week 23 fell into the short period of slightly more negative impact under future climate conditions than under current climate conditions fig 9 bau scenario hence the respective spatial pattern contained many cells of short mean lifetimes dark green fig 10b nevertheless the lmg remained rather unaffected by this scenario in the upper north and southern mountain regions qualitatively similar patterns were found for mowing weeks 22 26 in all three climate change scenarios and all simulation periods see supplement s3 the development of the mean density inside single grid cells showed that the described patterns are mainly determined by three relevant climate categories within the study region wet and warm mostly southern cells outside the dry and mountain regions cold mostly northern grid cells and especially mountain regions fig 5 marks 1 2 and dry fig 5 marks 3 5 we selected a representative grid cell for each of the climate categories highlighted in fig 10 to illustrate the characteristic population development fig 11 the resulting population development patterns confirm that without mowing the population eventually reached high densities in all three cell categories fig 11a b the highest values occurred under wet and warm conditions the maximum density is already achieved in 2070 followed by cold and dry conditions early mowing in week 23 favored populations in cold regions but worsened the situation in dry regions this worsening was even more prominent in wet and warm regions fig 11c late mowing in week 34 hindered population development only slightly under wet and warm conditions but hindered it more severely in dry regions fig 11d under cold conditions late mowing had a grave impact and often caused premature extinction fig 11a the main driver for the different impacts of mowing was temperature it shifted the hatching date and altered the duration of the larval life stage for instance a development delay of three weeks occurred in cold cells compared to wet and warm cells fig 11b mark a this was advantageous in the case of early mowing in week 23 because due to the delay the population was still in the belowground phase and was thus less affected by mowing low mortality fig 11c mark c fast developing populations in warm cells however were strongly affected fig 11c mark e because many eggs had already hatched thus most of the aboveground larval population was killed by mowing in dry cells the slightly slower population development led to a moderate loss of larvae which prevented substantial growth fig 11c mark d these different effects of early mowing in the different cell types explain the spatial pattern in the long mean lifetimes in cold mountain regions and shorter lifetimes in wet and warm cells and in dry cells fig 10b in contrast when mowing occurred later in the year fast population development proved beneficial in wet and warm cells oviposition had mostly already taken place and mowing had only a minor effect on the belowground clutch fig 11d mark f however slowly developing populations in cold regions were hit in the middle of the aboveground phase and a large number of larvae and imagines were lost fig 11c mark h as a consequence the small number of eggs placed in the ground resulted in a constant population reduction from year to year fig 11a in dry regions populations were affected by late mowing in week 34 fig 11d mark g which concurred during the drought period thus late mowing in dry cells allowed population survival but prevented further growth fig 11a notably the gradients of the mean lifetime from north to south and the differences between the mountain regions and other regions fig 10b c did not occur without mowing fig 10a this finding indicates that the regionally different temperature induced shifts in life stage development do not necessarily have considerable long term effects on populations without mowing however in combination with specific mowing schedules minor temporal shifts can have major effects on the populations susceptibility to mowing and thus on long term population development 4 discussion the simulation results of the presented hileg model provide the following answers to our research questions 1 outside of dry regions climate change increases lmg population viability and promotes the species spatial expansion 2 grassland mowing is mostly unproblematic during autumn and winter but highly detrimental in late spring and summer and 3 regionally different climate conditions affect the mowing impact and should therefore be addressed by adaptive mowing schedules these findings are discussed in more detail below there is basically no regional shift in the lmg distribution but an expansion in the suitable regions in northwest germany the overall increasing temperatures create new potential habitats in regions that are otherwise too cold mountainous or too dry this is caused either by the direct positive influence of warmth or indirectly by accelerating the lmg s development such that it suffers from drought stress less often in fact we found that more drastic climate change facilitates the survival and growth of the lmg even more strongly in future scenarios the positive effects of increasing temperatures on the grasshopper s abundance and distribution visible in our results are in line with the results of poniatowski et al 2018 and trautner and hermann 2008 however extended dry seasons as projected for the period 2060 79 in the bau climate change scenario fig 6 could inhibit this beneficial effect by causing drought stress for the lmg clutch regions affected by low soil moisture in this way fig 5 marks 3 5 could become less habitable for the lmg while nearby wetter regions still benefit from the temperature increase figs 7 and 8 bau 2060 79 it is the duration of the dry season that makes soil moisture a crucial factor for the survival of the lmg although our results show that dry regions do not necessarily cause drought stress within the study region it is likely that such a problematic extension of dry seasons will become more common in the future especially in regions that are generally drier than northwest germany hence at a larger scale droughts are likely to affect the species survival and lead to a distribution shift from dryer to wetter regions if migration is not hindered anthropogenic disturbance through land use was more critical to the viability of the species than expected climate change the effects of grassland mowing were particularly severe when they occurred during the aboveground phase of the lmg life cycle currently it is common in extensively used grasslands that the mowing season starts before the aboveground phase is reached for instance gerling et al unpubl results show for the federal state of schleswig holstein a subarea of our study region that early mowing yields the highest benefit for a farmer later mowing however has a strong impact on the lmg s development if it occurs during the aboveground phase of the population even when considering that imagines can partly escape harvesters malkus 1997 and thus apply lower mowing induced mortality rates kiel 1999 marzelli 1997 the negative effect does not change qualitatively i e when we reduced the imago mortality to 0 5 instead of 0 95 per day data not shown although negative impacts decrease when mowing late two counterarguments need to be considered late mowing after summer is rather unprofitable for the farmer and hence may not be a feasible land use measure and the future shift of problematic mowing to a shorter period of time in summer fig 9 might go along with a similar shift of vegetation growth thus further reducing the economic profitability of late mowing our simulations with the combined impact of climate change and grassland mowing revealed regional differences that need consideration when choosing a mowing schedule the date of mowing mainly determines in which parts of the study region the impact on the species is high and where it is low mowing dates that are unproblematic in one region can have a highly lethal effect in another region in most of those cases if a population is affected by early mowing in a highly negative manner its development is hardly influenced in simulations with late mowing in contrast in other regions the population is highly disturbed by late mowing but remains mostly unaffected if mowing occurs early in the year altogether the regional impact of the mowing schedule can be subdivided into five phases 1 in early spring the populations are largely unaffected in all regions 2 between late spring and early summer they are severely affected only in warm regions 3 during summer all populations are highly affected barely allowing survival fig 9 4 between late summer and early autumn they are severely affected in cold regions and 5 in autumn populations in all regions are affected equally the duration and beginning of each phase slightly differ between the climate change scenarios and simulation periods but overall they show the same pattern see supplement s3 obviously temperature is the key factor affecting population dynamics the lmg prefers a warm climate and hardly survives in cold mountain areas that is why the simulated lifetimes are longer and population densities are higher in the more severe climate change scenarios as long as there are no extended drought events however lower not too low temperatures can be advantageous for the lmg if early mowing is applied as shown in fig 11b population development is slower in such regions meaning that the aboveground phase which is highly susceptible to mowing occurs later and lasts longer compared to warmer regions this finding explains the low impact during late spring and early summer phase 2 of the phases described above and the high negative impact during late summer and early spring phase 4 see the examples in fig 10b c and fig 11c d based on our results we can develop some possible management strategies for a species such as the lmg to increase population viability depending on the expected climate conditions in certain regions our results suggest that adaptive grassland management that takes into account the local climate conditions with respect to the lmg s life cycle would be the method of choice in practice however it may prove unrealistic to implement such micromanagement therefore we discuss some more generic management strategies in the following according to our findings looking exclusively at climate change the lmg mostly benefits from the projected temperature increase thus the crucial parameter to consider for management strategies in such a scenario is soil moisture in regions projected to experience longer dry periods particularly if they extend into autumn one could focus on installing maintaining or expanding measures that keep grasslands from drying up miller and gardiner 2018 especially if those grasslands are close to streams or other fresh water bodies alternatively one could consider implementing migration corridors and stepping stone biotopes to facilitate dispersal to wetter regions kimura and weiss 1964 schumacher and mathey 1998 apart from that it is important to keep in mind that one or two carefully timed grassland cuts per year can also be considerably beneficial for the development of the lmg malkus 1997 these cuts help maintain a favorable vegetation structure sonneck et al 2008 and can facilitate hatching by allowing more sunlight and therefore warmth to the upper ground miller and gardiner 2018 there are further adaptive management strategies that may allow lmg survival in cultivated grasslands our simulations demonstrated that intensive land use with mowing during summer i e the lmg s aboveground phase can be lethal for a population fig 9 if the grassland cuts though are scheduled either right at the beginning or the end of the aboveground phase wingerden et al 1992 or only every other year populations can survive the cuts though likely with low abundance fig 11a supports the latter suggestion by showing that populations do not immediately become extinct when exposed to a disadvantageous mowing schedule another possibility could be to apply different mowing schedules in neighboring grassland plots in that way given that individuals may migrate from one plot to another they might find refuge until vegetation regrows malkus 1997 although those small sized plot relations cannot be represented on the current scale of the hileg model the spatial gradient covered by our model fig 10b c gives an idea of the options and necessary regional adjustments it can make a large difference to have an offset of one or two weeks between mowing in grid cells not too far apart from each other in addition to adaptive scheduling changing either the technique e g inside out mowing malkus 1997 or the mown area e g by leaving uncut grass strips humbert et al 2009 kiel 1999 could help reduce the fatalities in case the cut cannot be delayed uncut grass strips might even facilitate the subsequent development of the lmg because larval instars can make use of vegetation with diverse height profiles krause 1996 from a methodical point of view our results highlight that a model s resolution can play a key role in supporting management strategies for a target species the daily time step allowed us to capture short but distinct weather events and small seasonal shifts in the climate that would have gone unnoticed in monthly or yearly mean values however in our simulations these daily dynamics had a significant impact on both short and long term population development similarly the different impacts of environmental conditions climate and land use on the populations different life stages could not have been discovered without explicitly considering the lmg life cycle and each life stage s specific characteristics the spatial resolution of our model 12 12 km2 cell 1 is quite high compared to that of global climate models 4 4 cf grid resolution of global climate models portal enes org data enes model data cmip5 resolution this high resolution allowed us to take into account spatial differences and gradients in neighboring regions especially with regard to the suitability of mowing schedules szewczyk et al 2019 state that process based regional scale models such as the hileg model could be further downscaled to predict species distribution at a more local or habitat level an even higher spatial resolution could allow the consideration of additional heterogeneity in the microclimate and grassland composition of potential relevance to species such as the lmg lmg imagines tend to choose moist locations with patchy vegetation for oviposition krause 1996 malkus 1997 such locations prevent drought stress ingrisch 1983 and promote egg development speed as they are sunlit wingerden et al 1992 larvae initially prefer a patchy low to medium height vegetation structure malkus 1997 older instars and imagines retreat to high dense vegetation for protection wingerden et al 1992 in this work we intentionally consider spatial heterogeneity with regard to only the climate parameters but assume that most of the other characteristics mowing schedule carrying capacity habitat size base demographic rates are spatially homogeneous we make this assumption because the purpose of our analysis is to determine the impact of spatially heterogeneous climate change and its interaction with land use the analysis would have been confounded by other sources of spatial heterogeneity to deduce specific species conservation plans it would be desirable and possible to include the spatial heterogeneity of the other mentioned factors as well another extension of the model could be to include dispersal between different grassland patches which would allow for the migration of individuals from less suitable grassland patches to more suitable ones additionally dispersal between metapopulations hanski 1999 levins 1969 could partially provide refuge from the negative effects of grassland use through recolonization from other grassland patches brown and kodric brown 1977 however bönsel and sonneck 2011 emphasize that metapopulation dynamics cannot be assumed for low dispersal species such as the lmg in highly fragmented landscapes hence such rescue effects will just be relevant on small spatial scales and in regions with appropriate habitat connectivity large scale shifts in the spatial distribution of the species will occur only on long time scales 5 conclusion we introduced the hileg model for the pva of terrestrial animal species that develop through several life stages and whose development is affected by changing climate conditions and anthropogenic disturbances the model helps identify potentially suitable regions for the species in a prospectively changing and disturbed environment our model can be adapted to the life cycles of different target species by setting the appropriate demographic population parameters spatially explicit climate data and information about the timing of disturbances in that way it can be used as a tool for stakeholders and decision makers in conservation biology for finding strategies to conserve endangered species we applied our model to the lmg in northwest germany the analysis showed that the lmg can broadly benefit from climate change although with some regional variability more importantly however the benefits were often not maintained in combination with land use in particular the timing of grassland mowing turned out to be a crucial factor for population survival furthermore its effect on the species strongly depended on the spatially heterogeneous climate conditions our consideration of the different population life stages and the daily resolution of the climate variables was critical for detecting unexpected strong long term effects on the lmg s population viability this observation became even more prominent as the effects differed spatially to protect the lmg in cultivated grasslands we suggest applying adaptive management strategies such strategies should consider the regional differences that mainly result from the temperature driven development speed of lmg populations they should be updated on a regular basis depending on the climate change severity to keep track of possibly changing conditions regions projected to experience longer and more severe dry seasons should either supply sufficiently large refugia to maintain local populations or build stepping stone habitats that allow lmg dispersal to more suitable regions overall we showed that conservation of the lmg or other species with similar traits is possible even in cultivated grasslands as long as smart adaptive and far sighted management strategies are applied credit authorship contribution statement johannes a leins conceptualization methodology software formal analysis investigation

24678,both climate change and land use regimes affect the viability of populations but they are often studied separately moreover population viability analyses pvas often ignore the effects of large environmental gradients and use temporal resolutions that are too coarse to take into account that different stages of a population s life cycle may be affected differently by climate change here we present the high resolution large environmental gradient hileg model and apply it in a pva with daily resolution based on daily climate projections for northwest germany we used the large marsh grasshopper lmg as the target species and investigated 1 the effects of climate change on the viability and spatial distribution of the species 2 the influence of the timing of grassland mowing on the species and 3 the interaction between the effects of climate change and grassland mowing the stage and cohort based model was run for the spatially differentiated environmental conditions temperature and soil moisture across the whole study region we implemented three climate change scenarios and analyzed the population dynamics for four consecutive 20 year periods climate change alone would lead to an expansion of the regions suitable for the lmg as warming accelerates development and due to reduced drought stress however in combination with land use the timing of mowing was crucial as this disturbance causes a high mortality rate in the aboveground life stages assuming the same date of mowing throughout the region the impact on viability varied greatly between regions due to the different climate conditions the regional negative effects of the mowing date can be divided into five phases 1 in early spring the populations were largely unaffected in all the regions 2 between late spring and early summer they were severely affected only in warm regions 3 in summer all the populations were severely affected so that they could hardly survive 4 between late summer and early autumn they were severely affected in cold regions and 5 in autumn the populations were equally affected across all regions the duration and start of each phase differed slightly depending on the climate change scenario and simulation period but overall they showed the same pattern our model can be used to identify regions of concern and devise management recommendations the model can be adapted to the life cycle of different target species climate projections and disturbance regimes we show with our adaption of the hileg model that high resolution pvas and applications on large environmental gradients can be reconciled to develop conservation strategies capable of dealing with multiple stressors keywords climate change land use population viability analysis stage based model high resolution environmental gradients 1 introduction in terrestrial ecosystems land use and climate change are two dominant factors driving biodiversity loss millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 the risk of species loss can be estimated using simulation models that support population viability analysis pva in changing environments pvas are used to assess the viability of species and populations as a function of species parameters such as the population growth rate environmental conditions such as food availability and anthropogenic impacts such as the fragmentation and deterioration of habitats beissinger and mccullough 2002 coulson et al 2001 these analyses are of great value in conservation biology to decide where when and how which species should be protected while pvas are widely performed chaudhary and oli 2020 pe er et al 2013 stephens 2016 most of them address small areas build on aggregated demographic rates and use low temporal resolutions e g years in recent years however it has become increasingly clear that three interrelated factors need to be considered in pvas to broaden their scope first a large spatial extent can be important to capture relevant environmental gradients second considering all life stages i e the full life cycle of a species is relevant radchuk et al 2013 because stages respond in different levy et al 2015 or even contrary ways cordes et al 2020 to changes in the environment caused for example by climate change third the high temporal resolution of climate data has proven relevant for improving modeling results radchuk et al 2014 for instance to capture the impact of extreme conditions ma et al 2015 the second and third factors are interrelated as capturing the response of different life stages to external conditions requires high resolution data yet to our knowledge only few studies so far use such highly resolved external drivers especially in combination with spatial gradients and distinguishing different life stages bonnot 2016 green et al 2014 schmidt and zinkernagel 2017 thompson et al 2012 here we present the high resolution large environmental gradient hileg model a spatially differentiated stage and cohort based simulation model that allows us to use daily time steps to mechanistically examine the interrelations between population dynamics and external drivers such as climate and land use the hileg model is designed to be used for different terrestrial animal species by specifying a corresponding set of parameters and external drivers along large environmental gradients we use climate data with a daily temporal resolution and a spatial resolution of 12 12 km² grid cells and that widely cover northwest germany in each climate cell a representative patch of grassland is considered similar to a sensitivity analysis the comparison of the model results for different climate cells allows the exploration of the dependence of population viability on climate change and land use as well as the interaction between the two factors experimental data on the impact of climate parameters such as temperature precipitation and soil moisture on population dynamics are usually scarce and uncertain which is also the case in the present study the output of the model simulations is thus too uncertain to make quantitative predictions on the future development or viability of a target species however relative predictions and comparative analyses are usually robust to data uncertainty drechsler et al 2003 mccarthy and possingham 2014 for example if they address the influence of an environmental factor on the ranking of habitats or land use measures with regard to their suitability for a species the present pva is such a relative analysis as a first application we parametrized the hileg model for the well studied large marsh grasshopper lmg stethophyma grossum in cultivated grasslands of northwest germany and simulated its population dynamics for the years 2000 2079 given different climate change scenarios and schedules for grassland mowing the lmg prefers wet meadows and marshes as habitats while its life stages are affected differently by climate conditions and the timing of grassland mowing warm temperatures accelerate hatching and larva development while spring and autumn droughts degrade eggs located below ground mowing is highly lethal for larvae and imagines because they can hardly escape the harvesters the lmg is partly considered threatened in the federal states of northwest germany winkler 2000 and therefore of high relevance for local conservation agencies while recent studies project this species will benefit from elevated temperatures caused by climate change poniatowski et al 2018 trautner and hermann 2008 they state that extended droughts and anthropogenic disturbances such as mowing and grazing depending on their timing can still pose a threat to its survival löffler et al 2019 poniatowski et al 2018 our model allows simulating the combined effects of different scenarios of climate change and mowing schedules on lmg population dynamics therefore it helps to evaluate possible conservation measures by assessing how the timing of grassland mowing can be altered to adapt to climate induced shifts in the lmg life cycle to this end the model considers temporal changes and spatial heterogeneity in essential climate variables in principle our model is also able to consider spatial heterogeneity in other factors such as habitat size food competitors predators and land use however the aim of the model is not to investigate real land use patterns with spatially heterogeneous mowing dates or other heterogeneous features in the study region rather our model aims to solve the problem of coupling high resolution climate data into a demographic model and investigating how the dynamics of local lmg populations are affected by the locally changing climate and selected mowing schedules specifically the following questions are addressed 1 how do population density and viability shift regionally given different climate change scenarios 2 which mowing schedule has the least negative impact on the overall population density and viability in the study region 3 does the mowing impact severity depend on the spatial location with its specific climate 2 material and methods our case study involves four main components the study region northwest germany and the surrounding areas the target species lmg climate data projections until 2080 and land use grassland mowing these components are described in the following subsections furthermore the hileg model which simulates the interplay between these components is introduced in section 2 6 2 1 study region the study region is northwest germany and the surrounding areas fig 1 for which climate projections were available section 2 3 more precisely those regions are the federal states of schleswig holstein lower saxony hamburg and bremen as well as surrounding areas of germany denmark and the netherlands the spatial resolution of the grid cells areas of 12 12 km2 yields 968 terrestrial grid cells within the study region 2 2 target species the lmg s grossum linné 1758 is a well studied locust species that is widely distributed in central european grass and wetlands heydenreich 1999 though the grasshopper itself tolerates a wide range of temperatures and humidity the high water demand of its eggs restricts the lmg to wet habitats such as meadows and marshes ingrisch and köhler 1998 koschuh 2004 during a year it develops through three consecutive life stages fig 2 which often overlap to some degree within a population 1 egg embryo typical timing between july and june of the following year below ground 2 larval may october above ground 3 imago july october above ground heydenreich 1999 ingrisch and köhler 1998 kleukers et al 1997 köhler and weipert 1991 malkus 1997 marshall and haes 1988 oschmann 1969 stage 1 goes through additional development phases that are included in our model the embryo development inside the egg is interrupted by a diapause to prevent too early development under rather good conditions and an extended cold period is needed to break this diapause furthermore for ideal development the eggs need to be exposed to contact water before and after winter ingrisch 1983 i e they must be covered with water or lie in moist soil similar to other locusts the lmg is regarded as an indicator for the quality of grassland habitats báldi and kisbenedek 1997 heydenreich 1999 keller et al 2012 keßler et al 2012 it is considered threatened in parts of the study region e g according to the red lists for schleswig holstein winkler 2000 and germany blab et al 1984 maas et al 2002 to our knowledge more recent lists are not available the climate conditions within the lmg s habitat have different implications for population development warm temperatures accelerate embryo hatching in spring wingerden et al 1991 and larval development during summer ingrisch and köhler 1998 uvarov 1977 a sustained dry upper soil layer depth of 2 10 cm before and after winter causes drought stress during egg embryo development ingrisch 1983 considering both factors in terms of climate change there are two implications for the lmg on the one hand increasing temperatures might be beneficial because the accelerated species development could lead to larger population densities and therefore promote dispersal to new habitats poniatowski et al 2018 trautner and hermann 2008 on the other hand extended droughts could threaten hygrophilous species like the lmg löffler et al 2019 especially if they occur during spring or autumn by inhibiting egg and embryo development mowing is particularly harmful during the aboveground phase as larvae and imagines can hardly escape the harvesters and are mostly killed malkus 1997 marzelli 1997 eggs and embryos however are only mildly affected by the mechanical soil disturbances of harvesters therefore extensive grassland mowing with 1 2 cuts during the belowground phase i e early or late in the year is not considered problematic it can even benefit the lmg by maintaining the grasshopper s favored microclimate in an open and heterogeneous vegetation structure malkus 1997 miller and gardiner 2018 sonneck et al 2008 to limit complexity other factors of grassland suitability such as vegetation structure or food availability are not included in this study and are instead considered ideal for lmg development 2 3 climate data the climate data are taken from high resolution scenario simulations generated by the regional climate model cosmo clm 1 1 consortium for small scale modeling in climate mode cclm4 8 17 introduced by keuler et al 2016 for our study this regional model was driven at its lateral boundaries by simulation results of the global model ichec 2 2 irish centre for high end computing ec earth and three representative concentration pathways rcps rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 these pathways represent potential climate developments with different global warming rates for the 21st century the number indicates the equivalent of additional radiative forcing in w m 2 van vuuren et al 2011 of the increasing greenhouse gas concentrations by the year 2100 hereafter the climate change scenarios will be distinguished by action taken towards reducing co2 emissions full force ff rcp2 6 moderate mod rcp4 5 and business as usual bau rcp8 5 the regional model provides time series of daily climate data values mean or sum that are spatially resolved to grid cells of size 12 12 km2 common in such regional models these cells are located in a rotated pole grid coordinate system cosmo clm only provides a single climate projection per global model rcp and grid cell that would have limited hileg to deterministic time series within a climate change scenario to mitigate this limitation for the stochastic model processes section 2 5 we resampled the climate time series per replicate run by randomly rearranging the years without losing the long term trend see supplements s2 and s4 section 5 from the available data we used time series for the years 1995 2080 with the regional model providing simulated data from 2006 onwards only the data before 2006 are readings of actual meteorological values we considered three climate parameters relevant for the lmg population dynamics as implemented in our model surface temperature ts c contact water cw kg m 2 and relative humidity upper ground rhug parameter ts is explicitly calculated by the climate model described below and simply referred to as temperature hereafter the parameters cw and rhug are deduced from other provided time series see supplement s1 they were established because a sufficient amount of contact water and humidity in the upper soil layer is relevant for the lmg egg development as described by ingrisch 1983 throughout the model cw and rhug are used in combination and are therefore referred to by the joint term humidity hereafter additionally we introduced the parameter relative soil moisture content rsmc hereafter referred to as soil moisture it is a representation of the parameter total soil moisture content mrso kg m 2 calculated by the climate model divided by its yearly maximum values soil moisture and humidity are correlated parameters as both depend on mrso see supplement s1 equations s1 2 s1 7 and s1 10 in our analysis we mainly focus on soil moisture for reasons of simplicity it is closer to parameters considered by stake holders e g total soil moisture precipitation than the more abstract parameter humidity in terms of our model and is thus easier to comprehend together with the parameter temperature projections of soil moisture for the years 2000 2080 are given in fig 3 their spatial distributions in the study region are shown in fig 5 2 4 land use anthropogenic influence on the model species is represented by mechanical mowing as a scheduled grassland use measure it is executed uniformly over the whole study region once per year at the beginning of the same calendar week mowing day within our model mowing has a solely negative effect on the model species but with different severities for the below and aboveground populations other indirect effects of mowing are not included in the model see section 2 2 2 5 simulation output for each simulation scenario we generated fifty replicate runs using different random seeds to account for stochasticity section 2 6 table 3 to assess and compare the suitability of different regions for population viability under different scenarios we focused on two output values per grid cell the mean population density referred to as mean density hereafter over the full simulation duration and all replicates and the mean population lifetime referred to as mean lifetime hereafter over all replicates note that the maximum duration of simulation runs limits the lifetime to 20 years in our analysis values close to 20 years hint at population survival over the whole simulation duration in most or all replicates and thus hint at good conditions for longer persistence as well 2 6 model description a full model description following the odd overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2020 2006 is provided in supplement s4 here we provide a summary odd grimm et al 2020 which includes the models overall rationale an overview of the entities and processes and verbal descriptions of the key processes in the following odd keywords are in italics and capitals the hileg model is applied to the life cycle of the lmg whose life stages are affected by climate and land use climate conditions affect development and mortality while land use mowing events induces additional mortality especially during the aboveground phase by its present parameterization the model is nonspatial in the sense that the local lmg populations do not interact with each other spatial heterogeneity in land use and biotic variables such as habitat size are ignored however the essential climate variables are spatially differentiated to apply the model to spatial gradients in climate change scenarios covering northwest germany and the surrounding regions fig 1 the purpose of the model is to answer the following questions 1 how do the population density and lifetime shift regionally given different climate change scenarios 2 which mowing schedule has the least negative impact on the overall population density and viability in the study region 3 does the mowing impact severity depend on the spatial location with its specific climate the empirical patterns used to ensure that the model is sufficiently realistic for its purpose are the observed features of the life cycle and their sensitivity to environmental conditions which were taken from the literature these patterns were used for the model s design the model output in terms of the population structures densities and persistence were not compared to other data as such data are sparse therefore all model predictions are relative not absolute the model was implemented in c the source code of the model implementation the executable program and the input files used for the simulations runs are available via a gitlab repository 3 3 hileg gitlab repository https git ufz de leins hileg the model has the following entities grid cells defining environmental conditions and population per grid cell comprised of life stages which are comprised of age distinguished cohorts flows are auxiliary entities that manage the density transfer between life stages or their loss through mortality table 1 provides an overview of the model s entities and their state variables the lmg develops through three main life stages during a year section 2 2 following ingrisch 1983 and wingerden et al 1991 we divided the egg embryo stage into prediapause diapause and postdiapause development called embryo hereafter to account for the clutch s different susceptibility to climate conditions in autumn winter and spring this subdivision yields five life stages 1 prediapause 2 diapause 3 embryo 4 larva and 5 imago stages 1 to 3 occur below ground and stages 4 and 5 occur above ground furthermore stages 2 and 4 can have multiple cohorts to account for survival over several years in case of conditions during winter that are unsuitable for development and to account for different temperature driven development speeds depending on the hatching date the transition between different life stages is complex because the development and or mortality of cohorts and life stages depends on their previous state and is influenced by climate conditions temperature humidity flows are therefore used to collect all the contributions of all the cohorts of a certain life stage that completed development and therefore flow to the next life stage in the case of mortality a flow determines the amount of density lost by a life stage and its cohorts the model uses daily time steps here scale also reflects the sampling of the climate data however the single mowing event per year is considered on a weekly basis the first day of a calendar week to account for this weekly frequency a year has 364 days by definition resulting in exactly 52 full calendar weeks simulations were run for 20 years 7280 time steps or stopped earlier for a local population in the case of extinction the study region comprises 1296 36 36 grid cells each having an area of 144 km² 12 km x 12 km which corresponds to the resolution of the climate input data fig 1 in total 968 grid cells are terrestrial and therefore belong to the model domain within a grid cell a single habitat is considered which represents a virtual grassland plot with a size of 6 25 ha 250 m x 250 m grid cells and hence habitats are not connected i e there is no exchange of individuals if populations become extinct there is no recolonization the model is initialized with a starting date simulated duration mowing day and climate change scenario table 2 additionally each population receives an initial density per life stage i e 1000 eggs in the diapause stage zero density for the other life stages the carrying capacity individuals m 2 for the aboveground population i e the larva and imago life stages only is assumed to be identical for all the grid cells to reduce the number of confounding factors in the model analysis we used the four 20 year time intervals 2000 2019 abbreviated to 2000 19 hereafter 2020 39 2040 59 and 2060 79 to track changes for past and future climate conditions time series of climate data per grid cell are used as input data which drives the model s dynamics table 3 provides an overview of the model s processes each life stage has its own set of processes the basic rationale of the model is to assume a daily base rate for all processes which represents benign or observed average environmental conditions this base rate is then modified influenced by environmental drivers our model includes predefined functions or equations called influences that may be applied under certain environmental conditions the equations used to represent the influences and their parameterization as applied to the target species are listed in supplement s4 tables s4 4 and s4 5 generally each influence provides a factor that can mediate the effect of environmental conditions on the variables dynamic flow rate and development progress of a flow or cohort respectively in each time step and for every grid cell four main blocks of processes are scheduled update environmental drivers flow update life stage update and cohort update the first three blocks are scheduled one after the other while cohort update is executed as a submodel of life stage update during flow update the flow s state variables table 1 total flow amount current flow amount and dynamic flow rate are calculated from the contributions of cohorts state variables including the effects of environmental influences the submodel life stage update then calculates a life stage s gain from the incoming transfer flow of its preceding life stage and its density from the density of its subordinate cohorts gain is used to determine whether to create a new cohort from it or add it to an existing cohort densities of the subordinate cohorts are determined by the submodel cohort update before they are added to the life stage s density furthermore cohorts that exceed the maximum age before progressing to the next life stage or whose density falls below a certain minimum are removed during cohort update a cohort s density is changed by adding the potential gain determined by the life stage update submodel and subtracting loss through mortality or the outgoing transfer flow additionally some cohorts develop only if environmental conditions are suitable so their development progress is updated accordingly figure 4 provides an overview of the model s entities the processes and their interactions via flows and influences 3 results the results presented here are subdivided into three sections 1 patterns and trends found in the climate data that are relevant to the lmg section 3 1 2 analysis of the hileg model output stemming from simulations with climate as only external driver section 3 2 and 3 analysis of the simulation runs with mowing as an additional anthropogenic impact on the lmg section 3 3 since the results are complex as they cover large environmental gradients and detailed effects of environmental drivers on the study species in the following the main results are also directly discussed in terms of the underlying mechanism note that the model output occasionally reaches densities close to the population s carrying capacity which in reality is rarely the case on a large scale within the idealized conditions section 2 2 of our model realization however this behavior is expected and can be considered unproblematic for the analysis because we were focusing on the relative impacts of climate change and land use on population development rather than those of density dependence 3 1 patterns and trends in climate data the different climate projections showed spatial patterns and temporal trends for the years 2000 to 2079 in terms of temperature and soil moisture note that for reasons of consistency even the past time period 2000 19 consists mostly of simulated data see section 2 3 the coarse spatial patterns for all the climate change scenarios averaged over 20 year periods show that temperature increased slightly from north to south except for two colder mountain regions in the south fig 5 marks 1 2 over time the temperature generally increased similarly in the study region overall the increase was stronger for more severe scenarios with three exceptions first during the simulation period 2000 19 temperatures were more or less identical between the scenarios second for the period 2020 39 the temperature increase was slightly higher for scenario mod than for bau third during the late periods 2040 59 and 2060 79 temperature remained almost constant for scenario ff for soil moisture the patterns were more complex than those of temperature there were four regions of distinctively low soil moisture fig 5 marks 3 6 because these regions have a soil type that seems to favor drought k keuler pers comm cf keuler et al 2016 during the first period 2000 19 the mod and bau scenarios clearly showed lower soil moisture than the ff scenario in almost all the cells and an additional dry region in the southeast fig 5 mark 6 over time however many of those cells improved for the severe bau scenario while degrading for the ff scenario nonetheless the soil moisture for the bau scenario was barely higher than that for the intermediate mod scenario fig 3 overall the spatial patterns in the soil moisture showed the following temporal trends the northwestern dry region expanded over time fig 5 mark 4 some small dry regions appeared in the center of the study region the moisture of the mountain regions increased less than that of their surroundings the edges around the central eastern dry region became wetter and there was a spatial gradient of soil moisture increase in the southeast and decrease in the northwest on a monthly basis the climate parameters generally followed the trends in the yearly averages cf fig 3 data not shown for all the climate change scenarios and time periods the temperature usually reached its minimum around january and its maximum around july with gradual changes between these months the soil moisture was lowest in september and gradually increased to its maximum in march before constantly decreasing again an important exception from this general pattern appeared in the bau scenario during the period 2060 79 fig 6 the monthly soil moisture values deviated from the yearly trend such that june to october were especially dry while november to may were wetter than usual this finding indicates a severe and possibly extended dry season that could not be detected by examining only the yearly mean values 3 2 climate change impact on lmg the results of the hileg model confirm that without direct anthropogenic influence the lmg mostly benefits from climate change in northwest germany within each climate change scenario there was a clear upward trend from 2000 to 2059 for both the mean density and lifetime fig 7 for the last simulation period 2060 79 there was a saturation yielding results similar to that of 2040 59 comparing the climate change scenarios within the same simulation periods the mean results were quite similar except for differences between the ff scenario and the other two scenarios in the period 2060 79 fig 7 the scenarios led to similar spatial patterns in the mean density and lifetime within the same time period but also created certain subtle differences fig 8 first the population conditions improved over time in initially unsuitable areas such as cold mountain regions and dry regions cf fig 5 marks 1 5 an exception was 2060 79 when compared to the previous simulation period 2040 59 here the ff climate change scenario had negative effects on the mean densities and lifetimes in most of the cells the mod scenario showed almost no changes compared to the previous time period the bau scenario yielded improvements outside the dry regions but had negative effects within these dry regions comparing these spatially resolved model results to the climate data showed that they reflect the temperature patterns high temperatures support population development while colder regions notably reduce the mean density and lifetime fig 5 marks 1 2 recurrent significantly colder years fig 3a 2060 79 ff minima can inhibit the positive long term effect of warm temperatures fig 8 2060 79 ff the soil moisture patterns however are less perceptible though population development was clearly hindered in the main dry regions fig 5 marks 3 5 during the simulation period 2000 19 the mean lifetime increased significantly starting in 2020 the mean density in these regions however remained limited compared to those in the surrounding areas another pattern connected to soil moisture is the strong negative effect of an extended dry season fig 6 on populations in most dry regions during the period 2060 79 for the bau scenario fig 8 green areas in the bottom right subplots the peaks in the mountain regions remained mostly uninhabitable for the lmg throughout all the simulations as these areas stayed relatively cold fig 5 marks 1 2 in these regions the population declined almost constantly and went extinct after a few years this phenomenon is due to the impact of the overall lower temperatures on the lmg s development and mortality first it slowed down the development of the embryos and larval cohorts second the temperature threshold of increased larva and imago mortality occurred earlier in the year third the decelerated development additionally shifted larva and imago occurrence to a later hence even colder season of the year departing from the mountain peaks the conditions for the lmg gradually improved allowing a longer lifetime at first and increasing the population density thereafter the time lag in population development between the warm and cold cells shown in fig 11b mark a illustrates such a temperature induced shift in the life cycle low soil moisture had a negative impact on the lmg if the dry season had already started in late spring or lasted until autumn in these cases either the embryos spring or the prediapause eggs autumn experienced drought stress within the study region extinction by drought was mainly caused by the latter i e if a cell still had dry soil after oviposition fig 11b mark b increased embryo mortality through drought stress in spring usually did not lead to extinction but minimized the mean density the reoccurrence of conditions unfavorable to the lmg in the period 2060 79 for the bau climate change scenario was due to climate projections for this scenario though the notably higher temperatures led to favorable conditions in large parts of the study region a strongly extended dry season in the central areas had considerable negative effects on the mean densities and lifetimes fig 8 green areas in the bottom right subplots as a result the overall mean density and lifetime increased while their larger variations fig 7 reflected the low values in the dry areas 3 3 impact of grassland mowing in addition to climate change the extent of the negative influence of grassland mowing on the lmg life cycle was highly dependent on the calendar week in which it occurred fig 9 while mowing during spring and late autumn barely affected the mean lifetime it severely reduced the mean density if it occurred in summer and early autumn this result was independent of the climate change scenario and simulation period however due to the positive effect of higher temperatures in future scenarios the time windows of negative impact both shifted and shortened late mowing after week 33 became less detrimental while early mowing before week 26 had only a slightly more negative effect fig 9 mod and bau scenarios the spatial distribution of the mowing dependent mean lifetime revealed regional differences between the effects of mowing timing fig 10 in particular the periods of negative mowing impact did not apply to all regions in the same way fig 10 illustrates these differences using simulation period 2060 79 of the bau climate change scenario as an example apart from an overall negative effect of mowing on the lmg populations compare fig 10b c to fig 10a conditions for the lmg gradually degraded from north to south when mowing occurred early fig 10b moreover within the southern mountain regions the conditions remained relatively stable despite early mowing and stood out compared to their surroundings fig 10b however both patterns were inverted when mowing occurred late fig 10c in this case conditions gradually improved from north to south and were rather unsuitable within the mountain regions finally as a side effect the negative influence of mowing was generally stronger in the dry regions than in the wet regions especially for late mowing fig 10c note that mowing in week 23 fell into the short period of slightly more negative impact under future climate conditions than under current climate conditions fig 9 bau scenario hence the respective spatial pattern contained many cells of short mean lifetimes dark green fig 10b nevertheless the lmg remained rather unaffected by this scenario in the upper north and southern mountain regions qualitatively similar patterns were found for mowing weeks 22 26 in all three climate change scenarios and all simulation periods see supplement s3 the development of the mean density inside single grid cells showed that the described patterns are mainly determined by three relevant climate categories within the study region wet and warm mostly southern cells outside the dry and mountain regions cold mostly northern grid cells and especially mountain regions fig 5 marks 1 2 and dry fig 5 marks 3 5 we selected a representative grid cell for each of the climate categories highlighted in fig 10 to illustrate the characteristic population development fig 11 the resulting population development patterns confirm that without mowing the population eventually reached high densities in all three cell categories fig 11a b the highest values occurred under wet and warm conditions the maximum density is already achieved in 2070 followed by cold and dry conditions early mowing in week 23 favored populations in cold regions but worsened the situation in dry regions this worsening was even more prominent in wet and warm regions fig 11c late mowing in week 34 hindered population development only slightly under wet and warm conditions but hindered it more severely in dry regions fig 11d under cold conditions late mowing had a grave impact and often caused premature extinction fig 11a the main driver for the different impacts of mowing was temperature it shifted the hatching date and altered the duration of the larval life stage for instance a development delay of three weeks occurred in cold cells compared to wet and warm cells fig 11b mark a this was advantageous in the case of early mowing in week 23 because due to the delay the population was still in the belowground phase and was thus less affected by mowing low mortality fig 11c mark c fast developing populations in warm cells however were strongly affected fig 11c mark e because many eggs had already hatched thus most of the aboveground larval population was killed by mowing in dry cells the slightly slower population development led to a moderate loss of larvae which prevented substantial growth fig 11c mark d these different effects of early mowing in the different cell types explain the spatial pattern in the long mean lifetimes in cold mountain regions and shorter lifetimes in wet and warm cells and in dry cells fig 10b in contrast when mowing occurred later in the year fast population development proved beneficial in wet and warm cells oviposition had mostly already taken place and mowing had only a minor effect on the belowground clutch fig 11d mark f however slowly developing populations in cold regions were hit in the middle of the aboveground phase and a large number of larvae and imagines were lost fig 11c mark h as a consequence the small number of eggs placed in the ground resulted in a constant population reduction from year to year fig 11a in dry regions populations were affected by late mowing in week 34 fig 11d mark g which concurred during the drought period thus late mowing in dry cells allowed population survival but prevented further growth fig 11a notably the gradients of the mean lifetime from north to south and the differences between the mountain regions and other regions fig 10b c did not occur without mowing fig 10a this finding indicates that the regionally different temperature induced shifts in life stage development do not necessarily have considerable long term effects on populations without mowing however in combination with specific mowing schedules minor temporal shifts can have major effects on the populations susceptibility to mowing and thus on long term population development 4 discussion the simulation results of the presented hileg model provide the following answers to our research questions 1 outside of dry regions climate change increases lmg population viability and promotes the species spatial expansion 2 grassland mowing is mostly unproblematic during autumn and winter but highly detrimental in late spring and summer and 3 regionally different climate conditions affect the mowing impact and should therefore be addressed by adaptive mowing schedules these findings are discussed in more detail below there is basically no regional shift in the lmg distribution but an expansion in the suitable regions in northwest germany the overall increasing temperatures create new potential habitats in regions that are otherwise too cold mountainous or too dry this is caused either by the direct positive influence of warmth or indirectly by accelerating the lmg s development such that it suffers from drought stress less often in fact we found that more drastic climate change facilitates the survival and growth of the lmg even more strongly in future scenarios the positive effects of increasing temperatures on the grasshopper s abundance and distribution visible in our results are in line with the results of poniatowski et al 2018 and trautner and hermann 2008 however extended dry seasons as projected for the period 2060 79 in the bau climate change scenario fig 6 could inhibit this beneficial effect by causing drought stress for the lmg clutch regions affected by low soil moisture in this way fig 5 marks 3 5 could become less habitable for the lmg while nearby wetter regions still benefit from the temperature increase figs 7 and 8 bau 2060 79 it is the duration of the dry season that makes soil moisture a crucial factor for the survival of the lmg although our results show that dry regions do not necessarily cause drought stress within the study region it is likely that such a problematic extension of dry seasons will become more common in the future especially in regions that are generally drier than northwest germany hence at a larger scale droughts are likely to affect the species survival and lead to a distribution shift from dryer to wetter regions if migration is not hindered anthropogenic disturbance through land use was more critical to the viability of the species than expected climate change the effects of grassland mowing were particularly severe when they occurred during the aboveground phase of the lmg life cycle currently it is common in extensively used grasslands that the mowing season starts before the aboveground phase is reached for instance gerling et al unpubl results show for the federal state of schleswig holstein a subarea of our study region that early mowing yields the highest benefit for a farmer later mowing however has a strong impact on the lmg s development if it occurs during the aboveground phase of the population even when considering that imagines can partly escape harvesters malkus 1997 and thus apply lower mowing induced mortality rates kiel 1999 marzelli 1997 the negative effect does not change qualitatively i e when we reduced the imago mortality to 0 5 instead of 0 95 per day data not shown although negative impacts decrease when mowing late two counterarguments need to be considered late mowing after summer is rather unprofitable for the farmer and hence may not be a feasible land use measure and the future shift of problematic mowing to a shorter period of time in summer fig 9 might go along with a similar shift of vegetation growth thus further reducing the economic profitability of late mowing our simulations with the combined impact of climate change and grassland mowing revealed regional differences that need consideration when choosing a mowing schedule the date of mowing mainly determines in which parts of the study region the impact on the species is high and where it is low mowing dates that are unproblematic in one region can have a highly lethal effect in another region in most of those cases if a population is affected by early mowing in a highly negative manner its development is hardly influenced in simulations with late mowing in contrast in other regions the population is highly disturbed by late mowing but remains mostly unaffected if mowing occurs early in the year altogether the regional impact of the mowing schedule can be subdivided into five phases 1 in early spring the populations are largely unaffected in all regions 2 between late spring and early summer they are severely affected only in warm regions 3 during summer all populations are highly affected barely allowing survival fig 9 4 between late summer and early autumn they are severely affected in cold regions and 5 in autumn populations in all regions are affected equally the duration and beginning of each phase slightly differ between the climate change scenarios and simulation periods but overall they show the same pattern see supplement s3 obviously temperature is the key factor affecting population dynamics the lmg prefers a warm climate and hardly survives in cold mountain areas that is why the simulated lifetimes are longer and population densities are higher in the more severe climate change scenarios as long as there are no extended drought events however lower not too low temperatures can be advantageous for the lmg if early mowing is applied as shown in fig 11b population development is slower in such regions meaning that the aboveground phase which is highly susceptible to mowing occurs later and lasts longer compared to warmer regions this finding explains the low impact during late spring and early summer phase 2 of the phases described above and the high negative impact during late summer and early spring phase 4 see the examples in fig 10b c and fig 11c d based on our results we can develop some possible management strategies for a species such as the lmg to increase population viability depending on the expected climate conditions in certain regions our results suggest that adaptive grassland management that takes into account the local climate conditions with respect to the lmg s life cycle would be the method of choice in practice however it may prove unrealistic to implement such micromanagement therefore we discuss some more generic management strategies in the following according to our findings looking exclusively at climate change the lmg mostly benefits from the projected temperature increase thus the crucial parameter to consider for management strategies in such a scenario is soil moisture in regions projected to experience longer dry periods particularly if they extend into autumn one could focus on installing maintaining or expanding measures that keep grasslands from drying up miller and gardiner 2018 especially if those grasslands are close to streams or other fresh water bodies alternatively one could consider implementing migration corridors and stepping stone biotopes to facilitate dispersal to wetter regions kimura and weiss 1964 schumacher and mathey 1998 apart from that it is important to keep in mind that one or two carefully timed grassland cuts per year can also be considerably beneficial for the development of the lmg malkus 1997 these cuts help maintain a favorable vegetation structure sonneck et al 2008 and can facilitate hatching by allowing more sunlight and therefore warmth to the upper ground miller and gardiner 2018 there are further adaptive management strategies that may allow lmg survival in cultivated grasslands our simulations demonstrated that intensive land use with mowing during summer i e the lmg s aboveground phase can be lethal for a population fig 9 if the grassland cuts though are scheduled either right at the beginning or the end of the aboveground phase wingerden et al 1992 or only every other year populations can survive the cuts though likely with low abundance fig 11a supports the latter suggestion by showing that populations do not immediately become extinct when exposed to a disadvantageous mowing schedule another possibility could be to apply different mowing schedules in neighboring grassland plots in that way given that individuals may migrate from one plot to another they might find refuge until vegetation regrows malkus 1997 although those small sized plot relations cannot be represented on the current scale of the hileg model the spatial gradient covered by our model fig 10b c gives an idea of the options and necessary regional adjustments it can make a large difference to have an offset of one or two weeks between mowing in grid cells not too far apart from each other in addition to adaptive scheduling changing either the technique e g inside out mowing malkus 1997 or the mown area e g by leaving uncut grass strips humbert et al 2009 kiel 1999 could help reduce the fatalities in case the cut cannot be delayed uncut grass strips might even facilitate the subsequent development of the lmg because larval instars can make use of vegetation with diverse height profiles krause 1996 from a methodical point of view our results highlight that a model s resolution can play a key role in supporting management strategies for a target species the daily time step allowed us to capture short but distinct weather events and small seasonal shifts in the climate that would have gone unnoticed in monthly or yearly mean values however in our simulations these daily dynamics had a significant impact on both short and long term population development similarly the different impacts of environmental conditions climate and land use on the populations different life stages could not have been discovered without explicitly considering the lmg life cycle and each life stage s specific characteristics the spatial resolution of our model 12 12 km2 cell 1 is quite high compared to that of global climate models 4 4 cf grid resolution of global climate models portal enes org data enes model data cmip5 resolution this high resolution allowed us to take into account spatial differences and gradients in neighboring regions especially with regard to the suitability of mowing schedules szewczyk et al 2019 state that process based regional scale models such as the hileg model could be further downscaled to predict species distribution at a more local or habitat level an even higher spatial resolution could allow the consideration of additional heterogeneity in the microclimate and grassland composition of potential relevance to species such as the lmg lmg imagines tend to choose moist locations with patchy vegetation for oviposition krause 1996 malkus 1997 such locations prevent drought stress ingrisch 1983 and promote egg development speed as they are sunlit wingerden et al 1992 larvae initially prefer a patchy low to medium height vegetation structure malkus 1997 older instars and imagines retreat to high dense vegetation for protection wingerden et al 1992 in this work we intentionally consider spatial heterogeneity with regard to only the climate parameters but assume that most of the other characteristics mowing schedule carrying capacity habitat size base demographic rates are spatially homogeneous we make this assumption because the purpose of our analysis is to determine the impact of spatially heterogeneous climate change and its interaction with land use the analysis would have been confounded by other sources of spatial heterogeneity to deduce specific species conservation plans it would be desirable and possible to include the spatial heterogeneity of the other mentioned factors as well another extension of the model could be to include dispersal between different grassland patches which would allow for the migration of individuals from less suitable grassland patches to more suitable ones additionally dispersal between metapopulations hanski 1999 levins 1969 could partially provide refuge from the negative effects of grassland use through recolonization from other grassland patches brown and kodric brown 1977 however bönsel and sonneck 2011 emphasize that metapopulation dynamics cannot be assumed for low dispersal species such as the lmg in highly fragmented landscapes hence such rescue effects will just be relevant on small spatial scales and in regions with appropriate habitat connectivity large scale shifts in the spatial distribution of the species will occur only on long time scales 5 conclusion we introduced the hileg model for the pva of terrestrial animal species that develop through several life stages and whose development is affected by changing climate conditions and anthropogenic disturbances the model helps identify potentially suitable regions for the species in a prospectively changing and disturbed environment our model can be adapted to the life cycles of different target species by setting the appropriate demographic population parameters spatially explicit climate data and information about the timing of disturbances in that way it can be used as a tool for stakeholders and decision makers in conservation biology for finding strategies to conserve endangered species we applied our model to the lmg in northwest germany the analysis showed that the lmg can broadly benefit from climate change although with some regional variability more importantly however the benefits were often not maintained in combination with land use in particular the timing of grassland mowing turned out to be a crucial factor for population survival furthermore its effect on the species strongly depended on the spatially heterogeneous climate conditions our consideration of the different population life stages and the daily resolution of the climate variables was critical for detecting unexpected strong long term effects on the lmg s population viability this observation became even more prominent as the effects differed spatially to protect the lmg in cultivated grasslands we suggest applying adaptive management strategies such strategies should consider the regional differences that mainly result from the temperature driven development speed of lmg populations they should be updated on a regular basis depending on the climate change severity to keep track of possibly changing conditions regions projected to experience longer and more severe dry seasons should either supply sufficiently large refugia to maintain local populations or build stepping stone habitats that allow lmg dispersal to more suitable regions overall we showed that conservation of the lmg or other species with similar traits is possible even in cultivated grasslands as long as smart adaptive and far sighted management strategies are applied credit authorship contribution statement johannes a leins conceptualization methodology software formal analysis investigation

24679,reducing pesticide use in agriculture is essential but involves shifting towards more complex agroecosystems plant canopies are expected to be more heterogeneous because a more abundant weed flora is likely to remain in low herbicide fields and because intercropping i e mixing various crops species or varieties is a promising option to reduce chemical inputs simulation models are useful to understand and design complex agroecological cropping systems but they rarely represent the root systems of plants however belowground processes such as competition for soil resources or infection by root parasitic plants are key determinants of the structure of plant communities the aim of our study was to develop a model that simulates heterogeneous 3d individual based crop weed canopies from cropping system and pedoclimate and that will ultimately be used to design agroecological cropping systems therefore we 1 connected a root system model rscone to a weed dynamics model florsys in order to include both above and belowground parts of plants 2 evaluated the prediction quality of our model and 3 analysed the influence of species parameters on potential soil resource uptake and root infection by parasitic plants we used the well known allometric relationship between root and total plant biomass to connect rscone and florsys and we created new formalisms to model the effect of soil compaction on root growth our model was shown to correctly predict long term weed dynamics in various cropping systems from step 3 we characterized crops and weed communities that are potentially competitive for soil resources and most likely to be infected by parasitic plants and we deduced agronomic recommendations for example species emerging and occupying the soil quickly were the most likely to relay broomrape infestation and control of such species should take precedence although we focussed on crop weed competition our approach can be applied to other heterogeneous canopies for designing crop mixtures for example keywords soil resources competition parasitic plants heterogeneous stands weed management 1 introduction weeds can greatly reduce yields and harvest quality both directly by competing with the crop for light nutrients and water oerke 2006 and indirectly by serving as alternative hosts for pests norris 2005 or increasing workload for the farmer for example mézière et al 2015 weeds are mostly controlled by herbicides but this practice must be drastically reduced because of its detrimental side effects on environment and human health novotny 1999 non chemical cropping techniques such as diversifying crop rotation or soil tillage are efficient to control weeds provided that several are combined because their effects are partial liebman and gallandt 1997 among them growing mixtures of crop species is a promising weed management strategy because they are often more competitive than sole crops towards weeds liebman et al 2001 as a result reducing herbicide use is likely to make agricultural fields more heterogeneous with more diverse crop stands and possibly a more abundant residual weed flora managing weeds in such heterogeneous stands requires understanding competition among plants in order to minimize the damage caused by weeds and to maximise the yield and competitiveness of crop mixtures light is the major source of competition between plants in agroecosystems if fertilization provides non limiting soil resources wilson 1988a however as mineral fertilization must be reduced because of its environmental impact raun and johnson 1999 and as droughts become more frequent due to climate change turral et al 2011 competition for soil resources is likely to increase in agricultural fields soil ressource use can also be impacted by soil borne root pests such as root infecting fungi macdonald and gutteridge 2012 or root parasitic plants e g branched broomrape phelipanche ramosa l pomel parker 2013 which moreover can be hosted by weeds gibot leclerc et al 2003 therefore considering belowground competition between plants becomes crucial for designing efficient weed management strategies as each plant is likely to be surrounded by various neighbours with different abilities to compete different species and morphologies at different developmental stages different locations understanding competition relationships in heterogeneous stands involves going down to the individual plant scale given the multiple techniques to implement and the number and diversity of plants to consider managing weeds in a context of herbicide reduction is very complex and requires adapted tools moreover these tools must take into account the variability in effects depending on pedoclimatic conditions and in the long term because weed seeds persist for several years in the soil simulation models are useful tools to design cropping systems that manage such complexity bergez et al 2010 renton and chauhan 2017 models with a 3d individual based representation of plants are particularly adapted for heterogeneous stands because they allow to simulate the competition exerted on each plant in a field from all its neighbours gaudio et al 2019 renton 2013 renton and chauhan 2017 mechanistic models which are process based may easily be adapted to a great diversity of plant species because of their generic structure colbach 2010 however very few of such models include both above and belowground parts of plants so they represent competition between plants only partially gaudio et al 2019 renton and chauhan 2017 this is also the case of the florsys model colbach et al 2014 gardarin et al 2012 munier jolain et al 2014 2013 for example to our knowledge it is to date the only mechanistic model quantifying the effects of cropping systems on the dynamics of multispecies weed floras for decades in interaction with pedoclimatic conditions holst et al 2007 therefore this model is useful to design and evalueate sustainable weed management strategies colbach et al 2017b 2018 or crop ideotypes colbach et al 2019 it simulates the competition between crops and weeds for light by representing each individual crop and weed plant in 3d in a virtual field and their shading effect on each other s growth and morphological plasticity colbach et al 2014 munier jolain et al 2014 2013 however florsys ignores plant roots and belowground processes such as uptake of soil resources or root infection by soil borne pests to do so it must be connected to a root growth model with the following characteristics 1 having a 3d individual based representation of root systems 2 being sufficiently simple for multiannual simulations of thousands of plants in a field 3 being parameterized for most common crop and weed species encountered in agroecosystems and relatively easy to parameterize for new species and 4 predicting the key state variables that drive water and nutrient uptake and infection by parasitic plants i e root biomass and length density in the soil grenz et al 2005 malagoli and le deunff 2014 the recently developed rscone model is the only one in the literature meeting all required criteria pagès et al 2020 rscone is a metamodel i e a simplified model derived from a pre existing more complex model whose structure and parameter values were derived from a root system architecture model archisimple pagès et al 2014 it represents the root system of individual plants from four state variables as an envelop where root density is distributed across soil layers rscone is already parameterized for 35 crop and weed species using a relatively low number of parameters 22 with a biological meaning that can be estimated from archisimple simulations thus benefitting from experience on root system architecture models and specific parameterization work of the archisimple community bui et al 2015 drouet et al 2005 drouet and pagès 2003 dunbabin et al 2013 faverjon et al 2019 moreau et al 2017 pagès et al 2014 pagès and kervella 2018 pagès and picon cochard 2014 the objectives of this study were to study the determinants of soil resource uptake and root infection by parasitic plants by 1 connecting florsys and rscone to obtain a plant dynamics model that represents both above and belowground parts of plants in agroecosystems 2 by evaluating the predictive power of the new florsys rscone model by comparing simulation results to indepedent field observations 3 by identifying the key plant parameters involved in soil resource uptake and root infection by parasitic plants from simulation results and 4 by deducing from the latter step which parameters must be measured precisely when parameterizing new species and which processes the most influence soil resources competition and parasitism step 3 also allowed us to deduce agronomic recommendations the present paper does not yet model soil resource uptake and use or impact of root parasitic plants on host growth which will be presented in future papers moreau et al 2000 submitted pointurier et al n d 2 material and methods 2 1 model structures 2 1 1 the weed dynamics model florsys florsys is a mechanistic model i e a model that considers processes of the life cycle of annual crops and weeds that determine their multiannual dynamics it has been described in detail in other studies colbach et al 2014 gardarin et al 2012 munier jolain et al 2014 2013 we present here a quick summary of the model the user inputs data describing the virtual field to be simulated e g soil texture latitude weather temperature rainfall and radiation cropping techniques including crop sequence and initial weed flora at the beginning of the simulation from this information florsys predicts the weed seed bank and the density and biomass of weed and crop plants daily in the virtual field florsys represents each individual whether crop or weed plant seed the same way and affected by the same processes processes relevant for seeds in the soil are mortality dormancy and germination which are driven respectively by seed age season and soil climate seedlings emerge provided that the seeds are sufficiently close to the soil surface and that the soil is sufficiently moist and warm without compact soil clods blocking shoot growth these belowground processes are represented vertically over horizontally homogeneous 1 cm thick soil layers down to a depth of 30 cm soil climate and structure are predicted by the soil submodels of stics brisson et al 2003 and déciblé chatelin et al 2005 respectively included in florsys from emergence onwards plant phenology is driven by temperature with thermal time from emergence to flowering depending on the month during which plants reach the onset of vegetative stage soon after emergence depending on the species and emergence season flowering is indefinitely postponed to account for missing vernaliziation plant growth results from the accumulation of biomass by photosynthesis after removing losses due to respiration biomass accumulated daily is shared among aboveground organs i e leaves stems and seeds photosynthesis depends on the amount of photosynthetically active radiation par intercepted by plants depending on plant morphology and shading due to neighbouring plants to model this plant plant interaction each plant whether crop or weed is represented in three dimensions aboveground and located inside the field each plant is modelled as a cylinder the dimensions of which are defined by the height and width of the plant with leaf area distributed along plant height tillage and mechanical weeding operations move seeds in the soil and kill part of germinated seeds and plants plants may also die from frost herbicide applications or ageing in total 41 crop species or varieties including both cash and cover crops as well as 26 weed species are parameterized in florsys 2 1 2 the root system model rscone the rscone model has been described by pagès et al 2020 from daily inputs detailing allocation of biomass to roots soil constraint on root growth and soil temperature in each soil layer rscone predicts the root system dimensions of a plant daily together with the distribution of root biomass and root lengths shaded lines in table s1 in section a online the root system is depicted in three dimensions as a cylinder on top of a spilled cone inside which root density is distributed the dimensions of the root system envelop grow over time and are limited by soil compaction and low temperatures root biomass is calculated by confronting the biomass demand from roots which is determined by the root system dimensions to the biomass supply given as input root biomass is then distributed into each soil layer within the root system envelop assuming a homogeneous distribution within each layer and a linear decrease with depth from a maximal value at soil surface down to 0 at the root system tip root length density is determined by multiplying root biomass density by the specific root length srl twenty one weed species and 23 crop species or varieties are parameterized in rscone 2 1 3 new functions and parameters to connect rscone and florsys integrating rscone as a submodel of florsys required connecting both models at the connecting functions described below and in figure 1 florsys runs at the field scale representing a canopy as a collection of individual crop and weed plants limited to their above ground part rscone runs at the plant scale only representing the below ground part of a single plant this was grafted here below the above ground florsys plant making the two models connect at the scale of the individual plant exchanging information with a daily time step for now most of the connection is one way i e florsys variables are used as inputs of rscone root functions such as nutrient uptake will be implemented in another paper here only biomass remobilization from below to aboveground after disturbances such as mowing or frost are considered 2 1 4 phenology rscone and florsys both run with a daily time step but they use different time units for plant age in rscone plant age is given in days since germination under optimal temperature optimal days florsys uses two scales thermal time in c days with base temperature depending on species since plant emergence and plant stage cotyledon plantlet vegetative flowering onset maturity onset death with the duration of the vegetative stage depending on the plant s emergence season conversions had to be done to make optimal days of rscone compatible with thermal time in florsys see 1 in figure 1 2 1 5 soil constraint on root growth in rscone soil conditions can limit root system extension in width and depth if the soil is too cold or too compacted pagès et al 2020 rscone uses soil temperature as an input which will now be provided by florsys for connecting both models conversely rscone does not directly use soil structure variables as input but an abstract coefficient of root growth limitation by the soil ranging from 0 no root growth to 1 no soil constraint in each soil layer here we added a function to quantify this soil constraint from soil structure variables see 2 in figure 1 predicted by florsys from soil texture tillage soil moisture and frost 2 1 6 allocation of biomass to roots allocation of biomass to roots is an input of the rscone model and must be provided by florsys root biomass is known to be correlated to total plant biomass weiner 2004 wilson 1988a therefore we aimed at finding a relationship to calculate biomass allocated to roots from the aboveground biomass of plants predicted by florsys see 3 in figure 1 we collected data from different experiments described in table 1 to investigate this relationship we used data collected on a large range of crop and weed species including experiments testing the effect of nitrogen and light on root growth the relationship between root and total plant biomass of plants was analysed as a function of the effects of species nitrogen and light treatments with the following model using the function lm of r r core team 2019 and type iii sum of squares to ensure orthogonal constrasts 1 log 10 root biomass constant log 10 total plant biomass species nitrogen stress index light two way interactions residuals the nitrogen stress index was calculated as explained in perthame et al 2020 when plant nitrogen nutrition is optimal the nitrogen stress index is close to zero and nitrogen stress increases with the index value equation 1 was applied to the data from experiment e1 in table 1 in other experiments listed in table 1 the nitrogen stress index was not calculated and the effect of light was not tested only the nitrogen treatments listed in table 1 that we knew from previous experiments that gave near optimal plant nitrogen nutrition were kept for the analysis the following model was fitted to the data 2 log 10 root biomass constant log 10 total plant biomass species two way interaction residuals as data came from various experiments the effect of the experimental set up was also tested 3 log 10 root biomass constant log 10 total plant biomass species experiment two way interaction except species experiment residuals the interaction between species and experimental set up could not be tested because the experiments did not have enough species in common models were fitted by backward selection note that in legume species root biomass did not include nodule biomass since nodules only constituted a small part of belowground plant biomass under optimal nitrogen nutrition 4 and are not modelled in florsys 2 1 7 remobilization from roots to aboveground biomass when part of the aboveground plant biomass is destroyed by events such as frost or mowing plants change their source sink relationships and remobilize resources from the root compartment toward the aboveground compartments see 4 in figure 1 here this was approximated by changing the biomass allocation and respiration rates see section 3 1 3 according to preliminary simulation results not shown damages due to frost were overestimated we improved the model predictions by including a snow submodel to simulate the insulating effect of snow cover that protects plants from frost damages jégo et al 2014 trnka et al 2010 section b1 online 2 2 testing the new florsys rscone model with simulations 2 2 1 principle simulations of cropping systems were performed with florsys rscone to 1 evaluate the model by comparing simulation results to independent field observations section 2 3 2 and 2 identify key species parameters for potential soil resource uptake and infection by root parasitic plants section 2 3 3 data of ten cropping systems from the inrae experimental station of dijon époisses from 1999 to 2012 were simulated as described in colbach et al 2016 section c online they vary from herbicide intensive to herbicide free with various rotations tillage strategies and use of mechanical weeding initial weed seedbank for 25 weed species and soil characteristics given as inputs in the model were measured on soil samples taken in the fields weather data were obtained from the inrae weather station via the inrae platform climatik in french managed by the agroclim laboratory of avignon france https intranet inrae fr climatik each cropping system was repeated 10 times with the same inputs to take into account the stochastic effects of florsys in total 10 cropping systems 10 repetitions 100 simulation runs were carried out each over 13 years the simulated field sample was 6 4m² as the evaluation of the first florsys version showed the phenology submodel to badly predict flowering dates of weeds in the south of france and of some crop varieties colbach et al 2016 a corrective patch was added to keep weeds from flowering too early and to force crops to mature at harvest date not all florsys species have yet been parameterized in rscone in that case default parameter values were calculated by averaging parameters of species from the same clade i e monocotyledon or dicotyledon as clade was shown to discriminate rscone parameters pagès et al 2020 and from the same seasonal type i e winter annuals summer annuals or perennials 2 2 2 model evaluation aboveground plant biomass weed plant density weed seed bank and crop yield were measured in all ten fields during the 13 years of the trial and compared to variables predicted by florsys rscone as explained in colbach et al 2016 density and aboveground biomass were measured in several quadrats per field several times a year and weed seed bank was measured on ten soil samples every two years as root biomass was not measured we could not directly evaluate the prediction quality of roots in our model instead we checked whether including roots improved the prediction quality of aboveground variables by florsys variables were either analysed 1 at the species scale or 2 at the community scale i e they were summed over all species the prediction quality of the model was estimated with various complementary criteria described in colbach et al 2016 the prediction bias is the mean of residuals simulated y i observed values y i with i in 1 n from different fields years and species and determines whether the model systematically under or overestimated variables it was calculated relatively to the range of variation of observations i e divided by half the difference between the maximum and minimum observed values maxobs and minobs b i a s i y i y i n m a x o b s m i n o b s 2 the relative root square of the mean square error rrmsep evaluates the relative prediction error of the model it was calculated relatively to the standard deviation of observed values stdevobs coucheney et al 2015 colbach et al 2016 and corrected for variability in observations i e variability due to measurement errors varobs and in simulations i e variability due to model stochasticity varsim wallach 2006 r r m s e p msep v a r o b s v a r s i m s t d e v o b s m s e p 1 n i y i y i 2 v a r o b s 1 n q i q y i y i q where yiq is the observed variable in quadrat q for individual i from one field one day one species and q 4 the number of quadrats per field day v a r s i m 1 n r i r y i y i q where y i q is the simulated variable in repetition r for individual i and r 10 the number of repetitions per field day stdevobs 1 n y i y 2 where y is the mean of observations if msep is small or smaller than varobs and varsim the difference between observed and simulated values is mostly due to respectively observation error and or model stochasticity the ability of the model to rank cropping systems and weed species correctly was calculated as the maximum between the modelling efficiency the pearson and the spearman correlation coefficients between observations and predictions coefficients close to 1 indicate that the variables are well predicted by the model in terms of absolute values relative values i e differences between values and ranks respectively the three criteria relative bias rrmsep and proportion of correctly predicted observation were calculated from data averaged over the rotation i e over all simulated values or measurements per cropping system to check the model s ability to compare cropping systems to assess how well the model predicts outputs on a given day the criteria were calculated from data averaged per day i e averaged over quadrats samples and repetition except for daily weed density and biomass for these two outputs the proportion of correctly predicted observations was the proportion of observations inside the simulated 90 confidence interval obtained over the 10 repetitions this criterion was preferred over the three first evaluation criteria because the latter are considerably deteriorated by a delay of a few days in the simulations vs the observations or vice versa whereas such delays do not affect the prediction quality of the weed dynamics over the years colbach et al 2016 all the evaluation criteria were also calculated from simulations with florsys before the rscone model was connected in order to study whether the connection improved florsys predictions 2 2 3 potential soil resource uptake and risk of parasitism in order to study which species parameters determine potential soil resource uptake and risk of infection by p ramosa we analysed proxy variables see details below because these processes were not yet modelled in florsys at the time of this study we did not considered characteristics relative to root functioning when calculating our proxies e g host status or uptake efficiency because they are not yet included focussing on the influence of the morphology and the photosynthetic functioning of plants on root exploration root biomass summed over respectively all crop and weed plants was used as a proxy for potential soil resource uptake by crops and weeds malagoli and le deunff 2014 it was taken at the beginning of crop flowering when crop root biomass is near maximal gregory et al 1995 in order to get a global overview of root growth over the crop cycle the percentage of crop root volume overlapped by root systems of weeds was also calculated at crop flowering and averaged over the field in order to estimate crop weed competition for soil resources p ramosa is a holoparasitic non photosynthesizing root infecting plant whose seeds follow a seasonal dormancy pattern when buried in the soil and germinate when triggered by root exudates of host plants the parasite then attaches to roots of a host plant grows to the detriment of that host which usually dies without reproducing and produces a huge number of seeds that replenish the seed bank parker 2013 here the risk of infection by root parasitic plants such as p ramosa was approximated by the cumulated root length of crops and weeds grenz et al 2005 because parasitic seeds only germinate close to host roots 4 mm in order to infect them quickly otherwise they die in a few days joel 2013 only crops and weeds roots in the first 30 cm of soil were considered because parasitic seeds are unlikely to be buried deeper by tillage this proxy was calculated in autumn end of november and summer end of june when parasitic seeds are most likely to germinate before and after dormancy respectively pointurier et al 2019 as well as at crop flowering when host root exudation stops auger et al 2012 in order to analyse the relationships between species parameters and proxy variables for soil resource uptake and parasitism an rlq analysis combined with a fourth corner analysis was performed for weeds and pearson correlations were calculated for crops as in colbach et al 2019 the rlq analysis was performed with the library ade4 of r dray and dufour 2007 it consisted in relating three tables r l and q in order to study the relationships between our proxy variables described in table r e g total weed root biomass for soil resource uptake by weeds and the species parameters in table q while taking into account the relative contribution of each species within the weed community given by maximum annual weed species densities in table l table l consisted of the maximum densities of weed species over the growing cycle i e from sowing to harvest for each simulated year each cropping system and each repetition table q consisted of the root parameters described in table s2 in section a online and the aboveground parameters described in colbach et al 2019 were added to investigate the relative influence of the two types of parameters the significance of the correlations obtained in the rlq analysis was tested with a fourth corner analysis with 999 permutations of rows and columns in table l the latter procedure allowed to check that the correlations observed did show a relationship between proxy variables and parameters and that they were not affected by preferential distributions of weed species depending on cropping systems or on their parameters results of the rlq analysis were displayed with the package adegraphics of r siberchicot et al 2017 pearson correlations between crop proxy variables and parameters were calculated with the function rcorr from the package hmisc of r a principal component analysis pca was performed on proxy variables with the function pca from the library factominer lê et al 2008 and displayed using the function fviz pca var from the library factoextra of r parameters were projected as supplementary variables on the correlation circle i e they were not used for calculations in the pca to illustrate their relationship with the proxy variables proxy variables for both crops and weeds were log transformed prior to analysis because they were skewed 3 results 3 1 integration of rscone as a root distribution submodel in florsys 3 1 1 phenology radicle growth and water uptake prior to seedling emergence was already included in florsys in a previous work gardarin et al 2012 before emergence nitrogen uptake is negligible fayaud et al 2014 and no germination stimulants for parasitic plants are exudated gibot leclerc et al 2012 therefore we focused on post emergent root system development we considered that the post emergent root system starts to grow from the moment the plant emerges in florsys and we readjusted the relevant rscone timing parameters accordingly eq 2 in table s1 in section a online we recalibrated rscone durations expressed in optimal days to account for the season of emergence of the plant eq 3 in table s1 in section a online we considered that the season of emergence giving the shortest life cycle duration in florsys reflects plant development under optimal temperature and thus correspond to the rscone durations a plant emerging at a different season has a longer life cycle in florsys and the ratio of this longer duration to the minimum duration was used to lengthen the rscone root stage durations the effect of soil temperature on root system expansion was included in the rsoildls variables reflecting structural and thermal constraints in the soil see section 3 1 2 the timing of root system stages influences both the root system expansion eq 10 and 11 taken from pagès et al 2020 and its root density eq 31 and 32 taken from pagès et al 2020 3 1 2 effect of soil limiting factors on root growth root growth limitation by soil compaction was calculated from soil structure in florsys soil structure is predicted for the top three 10 cm soil layers as the proportion of soil clods distinguished by their degree of compaction and the process they were formed roger estrade et al 2004 types bδ and cδ are the most compact and block root growth contrary to cδ clods bδ clods are partially fragmented so they do not completely block root growth stones whose proportion in the soil is given as an input in florsys are assumed to have the same effect as cδ clods on root growth in the top soil layers up to 30 cm depth equation 4 in table s1 in section a online was based on these assumptions root growth is reduced proportionally to the proportion of stones bδ and cδ soil clods in the soil only half the proportion of bδ soil clods was considered in this equation to roughly take into account that they do not completely block root growth this sum was divided by 1 stone proportion to fit into 0 1 as the clod proportions are given by florsys relatively to total soil volume disregarding stones the results is then multiplied by a 50 factor rsmax borrowed from the stics crop model contrdamax brisson et al 2003 2002 brisson et al 1998 which correspond to the maximal reduction the soil can exert on root growth the result or rather 1 this result to get a corrective factor for root growth was multiplied by a species parameter pens reflecting the species ability to penetrate the soil as soil structure and temperature are not predicted below 30 cm in florsys soil constraint in deeper soil layers was predicted from soil variables at 30 cm depth eq 5 and 7 in table s1 in section a online the effects of soil compaction and temperature were then combined to get the total soil constraint growth in each layer eq 8 taken from pagès et al 2020 and applied to reduce root system dimensions proportionally eq 9 to 15 taken from pagès et al 2020 as soil constraint was applied to the entire root system every day in rscone and not only to new roots it could happen that a sudden high soil constraint for example compaction due to tractor wheels on a wet soil or a drop in temperature could dramatically shrink the root system from one day to another we added a condition to prevent such root system shrinkage eq 13 14 and 15 in table s1 in section a online because it was unrealistic apart in case of frost 3 1 3 biomass allocation to roots 3 1 3 1 data analysis in experiment e1 table 1 root biomass was strongly correlated to total plant biomass irrespective of species light condition or nitrogen stress index partial r2 63 of total r2 p 0 02 section d 1 online figure 2 the latter three factors i e species light and nitrogen stress index as well as two way interactions had a significant effect p 0 001 except for the interaction between total plant biomass and nitrogen stress index however the effect of light was negligible partial r² 14 of total r2 section d 1 online given the huge difference between shading levels i e 0 vs 90 and was removed from the model then data on fescue which had been removed from the analysis because it did not allow testing the effect of light see table 1 was included in the analysis the effect of the interaction between nitrogen stress index and species was also removed because it was negligible partial r² 0 23 of total r2 particularly compared to the primary effects of these variables and mainly due to one species i e fescue section d 2 online finally the following linear model was obtained section d 3 online 4 log 10 root biomass a 1 s a 2 s log 10 total plant biomass a 3 nitrogen stress index residuals where a1s a2s and a3 are parameters described in table s2 in section a online with a1s and a2s depending on the species in other experiments where the nitrogen stress index was not calculated parameters a1s and a2s were determined by fitting equation 2 from section 2 2 3 a strong linear relationship was also found with this model and data r² 0 98 figure 3 even though experiments with very different protocols were included in the analysis the effect of the experiment was found significant but negligible compared to the species effect partial r² 1 and 7 of total r2 respectively p 0 001 section d 4 online as parameter a3 did not depend on the species the value determined with equation 4 from the e1 experiment was used for all species even if parameters a1s and a2s were estimated on different experiments although we only used data obtained during vegetative stages data from other experiments showed that the relationship we found between root and total plant biomass remained valid at earlier and later stages section d 5 online 3 1 3 2 formalism used to connect florsys and rscone model 4 was used to calculate the root biomass ratio i e the ratio of the plant root biomass to its total biomass rbrdsi depending on species and nitrogen stress index this ratio was used to connect florsys and rscone eq 20 and 23 in table s1 in section a online in florsys plant growth is modelled differently depending on whether the plant is surrounded by shading neighbouring plants or not before plants start to compete for light i e at early stages generally less than 15 days after emergence munier jolain et al 2014 aboveground biomass accumulation is driven solely by thermal time since emergence colbach et al 2014 we added an equation to calculate the amount of biomass allocated to roots in rscone from the aboveground biomass predicted by florsys and the root biomass ratio rbrdsi eq 21 in table s1 in section a online we assumed that nitrogen stress was negligible i e a3 set to 0 in eq 20 in table s1 in section a online because it was not observed in such young plants perthame et al 2020 when plants start to compete for light in florsys they grow by accumulating biomass from photosynthesis daily losing some through respiration eq 22 in table s1 in section a online we used the resulting total plant biomass of the day to calculate the root biomass ratio rbrdsi eq 23 in table s1 in section a online and deduced the daily amount of photosynthesized biomass to be allocated to roots eq 24 in table s1 in section a online the remaining amount of photosynthesized biomass was allocated to aboveground organs then we calculated the part of biomass that was lost through respiration by roots and by aboveground organs respectively from the beginning of flowering onward when plants stop to allocate new biomass to roots gregory et al 1995 root biomass was assumed to be remobilized for aboveground organs the same occurred after plants lost aboveground biomass due to mowing eq 17 in table s1 in section a online or frost damage eq 18 in table s1 in section a online as long as the biomass level from before that event was not reached again eq 19 in table s1 in section a online this remobilization was modelled by charging respiration losses from both roots and aboveground organs to roots and by allocating all biomass gained by photosynthesis to aboveground organs only eq 25 in table s1 in section a online for very small plants because of the log log relationship root biomass could mathematically exceed total plant biomass i e rbrdsi 1 to avoid this biological non sense we added a condition to limit rbrdsi to the maximum root to total biomass ratio observed in our data eq 20 and 23 in table s1 in section a online 3 2 simulation results 3 2 1 crop production and multiannual species weed dynamics are well predicted by florsys rscone we compared simulations by florsys rscone to independent observations from the cropping system trial to determine the prediction quality and domain of validity of the model this showed that weed variables were generally well predicted at the species scale table 2 a and b with a small bias 7 17 more than 50 up to 67 of well ranked observations and very good predictions of daily dynamics more than 80 of observations within the simulated confidence interval however predictions were less good at the community scale particularly for seed bank and aboveground biomass spearman coefficients of 0 08 and 0 13 respectively because they were generally largely overestimated relative bias ranging from 15 to 206 and more than 50 of daily observations lower than the simulated confidence interval only multiannual weed density was as well ranked at the community scale as at the species scale pearson coefficient of 0 65 and 0 67 respectively crop variables were satisfactorily predicted table 2 b with crop biomass in particular well ranked with no bias crop yield was less well predicted with a slight underestimation and a high prediction error although the model was bad at predicting yield absolute values it correctly ranked cropping systems and years i e it could predict correctly that yield in cropping system x on year a was better than in cropping system y on year b for example 3 2 2 modelling roots improves the predictions of florsys comparing florsys simulations carried out with or without rscone to the independent field observations showed that integrating rscone partly allowed correct ing florsys deficiencies the additioinal submodel greatly improved the predictions of weed aboveground biomass prediction error largely decreased per species by 347 which is now better ranked bias decreased by 70 and spearman coefficients increased by 0 11 table 2 the predictions of weed densities and crop production did not improve nor deteriorate overall weed seed bank and crop yield were slightly less well predicted relative bias decreased by 6 and 4 respectively and modelling efficiency by 0 09 but this was negligible compared to variations due to model stochasticity observed between two simulations 3 1 and 0 04 respectively all other things being equal 3 2 3 crop parameters determining potential for soil resource competition and uptake and parasitism risk we investigated correlations among proxy variables for potential soil resource uptake i e total crop root biomass and parasitism risk i e total crop root length simulated by florsys rscone to see whether the same situations in terms of crop species cropping systems and weather conditions favoured the two root dependent functions both proxies were strongly correlated at crop flowering pearson correlation coefficient 0 85 in table 3 a and close points on the principal component analysis in section e 1 online which is also the stage when root growth stops in florsys rscone section 3 1 3 2 so though earlier resource uptake and parasitism risk might depend on different factors the same conditions determined the final cumulative outcome then we looked at correlations between the simulated root function proxies and the crop parameters entered into florsys rscone to identify which species features drove root dependent functions these correlations were found to be very strong absolute values of pearson correlation coefficients of 0 3 on average up to 0 7 major correlations in table 3 b h and complete results in section e 1 online and the proxies were associated to similar species parameters section e 1 online but despite investigating root dependent functions root parameters had less impact than parameters driving above ground morphology and shading response table 3 b vs table 4 c h in terms of plant structure crops potentially able of large uptakes of soil resources and most likely to be infected by p ramosa were mainly winter monocotyledons associated to winter annual and opposite to dicot species in table 3 f which present the longest growth duration resulting in more biomass production including root biomass and emerge when p ramosa seeds are non dormant these crops also present two other properties which are typical of winter crops i e their plants are little sensitive to frost low tfrostearly3 tfrostmid3 tfrostlate3 and their photosynthesis does not support high temperatures low tphoto3 the good nitrogen uptakers and the high parasite exposure crops also potentially explore a large soil volume i e their root systems presented a large cylinder shaped top high rcd their roots reached their maximal srl late high tsrlmax thus continuously increasing their exposure to p ramosa seeds per unit root length their plant height depended little on plant biomass low b hmmid and b hmlate resulting on homogeneously tall canopies which intercept more light and can thus can allocate more biomass to roots crops likely to suffer competition for soil resources from weeds i e the percentage of crop root volume overlapped by root systems of weeds tended to have the same species characteristics section e 1 online as good nitrogen uptakers indeed any feature that increases the root biomass and volume the proxy for nitrogen uptake also increases the probability of its overlapping with weed roots but correlations between the crop weed competition proxy and crop parameters were very weak absolute values of pearson correlation coefficients 0 3 section e 1 online as the crop weed root overlap also depended on weed characteristics different parameters drove risk of parasitism at different dates with opposite effects possible arrows perpendicular or in opposite directions on the pca in section e 1 online the strongest correlations with species parameters were found at dormancy induction of p ramosa seeds in autumn significant coefficients of 0 4 on average compared to 0 3 at the other dates section e 1 online the crops most likely to be infected then were characterized by early robust establishment adapted to autumn conditions good light interception and fast root system growth in detail they were dicotyledons table 3 which emerge better than monocotyledons particularly in compacted soil they had an epigeal germination requiring relatively wet conditions high basewp which are typical of autumn and their photosynthesis was sensitive to high temperatures low tphoto4 which is typical of winter crops they also grew quickly after emergence high rgr moreover the crops the most likely to be infected had large quickly growing root systems high emax rd and a2 thus increasing the probability of encountering p ramosa seeds although they allocated a low proportion of biomass to their roots low aa1 their plants were wide per unit biomass high wmmid and wmlate which increases soil coverage and thus light interception and root biomass production from flowering onwards the high risk crops allocated a larger proportion of their biomass to leaves high lbrlate again improving light interception which were located lower on the plant low rlhlate the high risk crops were also those that etiolated most when shaded by neighbour plants succeeding in maintaining light interception and biomass production they increased their plant height per unit biomass high mu hmearly allocated more biomass to stems low mu lbrearly mu lbrmid and mu lbrlate compensating with thinner larger leaves high mu slaearly and mu slamid which were shifted toward the plant top high mu rlhearly and mu rlhlate at dormancy release of p ramosa seeds in summer no strong correlations between proxy for parasitism and parameters could be identified table 3 at that time plant morphology is the cumulated result not only of species parameters but also of pedoclimatic conditions and cropping techniques which vary over the years the weather repetitions and the cropping systems 3 2 4 weed parameters determining potential for soil resource competition and uptake and parasitism risk in contrast to crops simulated root function proxies in weeds were positively correlated from early stages onwards table 4 a indicating that the same factors already drove root dependent functions much earlier in the season than for crops the correlations were again the largest in weeds at crop flowering pearson correlation coefficients 0 85 confirming that the same factors determined the final outcome in both root dependent functions correlations between simulated proxies and model parameters were weaker for multispecies weeds than for pure stand crops absolute values of correlation coefficients 0 2 table 4 b e compared to up to 0 7 in table 3 moreover in contrast to crops although the root function proxies were highly correlated in weeds they were not associated to the same species parameters indicating that other factors cropping system and or weather were more determinant only a predominantly low shade response after emergence within the weed community low mu slaearly increased both proxies risk of weed infection by p ramosa at crop flowering was moreover associated with weed species with more leaf area at their top high rlhearly and a low relative growth rate after emergence low rgr the multispecies nature of the weed community made it much more difficult to understand the reasons for these correlations such as the low rgr or the low mu slaearly which are detrimental to biomass production but in a multispecies community reducing one species type leaves niches for other species types that are driven by a combination of parameters which are not captured by the present analysis method rather than a single easy to identify parameter in contrast to crops no opposite effects were observed between weed parameters driving proxies for parasitism at different dates arrows in the same direction on the rlq axes in section e 2 online most key parameters were the same at crop flowering and at dormancy release of p ramosa seeds low rgr and high mu slaearly at both dates the proxy at the latter date was moreover associated with weed species with a low base temperature for germination and growth low baset which allow an earlier and faster root system growth the proxy for early weed infection in autumn at dormancy induction was correlated to several other weed species parameters table 4 b e there were six above ground parameters compared to only four root parameters indicating that root dependent functions depend at least as much on light interception than on root architecture weed infection was linked to weed species that allocated more biomass aboveground than to roots low root biomass ratio a2 that placed their large initial leaf area high la0 and slaearly above other plants thanks to a large allocation of biomass to stems low leaf biomass ratio lbrearly and a top distribution of the leaf area on the plant rlhearly high risk weed plants responded less to shade in terms of plant width and leaf area after emergence low mu wmearly and mu slaearly for these species having fine roots high srlmax increased the risk to encounter parasitic seeds more than exploring a large volume of soil as illustrated by low emax and re all these parameters were found to have a similar but much lower influence on the proxies for soil resource uptake and parasitism in summer correlation coefficients twice lower or not significant section e 2 online the proxy for competition exerted by weeds over crops for soil resources was the best correlated to two parameters of aboveground morphology last column of table 4 b e as for the proxy for soil resource uptake weed floras including many species with a low relative growth rate high rgr after emergence exerted potentially more competition towards crops competition was also increased by weeds that increased biomass allocation to leaves when shaded after emergence high mu lbrearly 4 discussion 4 1 what is new in our modelling approach by connecting two existing models rscone and florsys we developed the first plant dynamics model for heterogeneous multispecies canopies that 1 takes into account both aboveground and root compartments so that it could ultimately integrate competition between plants for all resources light water and nutrients 2 for as many as 56 species of crops and weeds interacting in a field 3 for several years 4 under the influence of cropping techniques and pedoclimate gaudio et al 2019 the major originality of our model is the individual based representation of plants in the competition submodel which makes it adapted for simulating heterogeneous stands for example gemini is another model which predicts the multiannual dynamics of multispecies plant stands under the influence of management techniques and pedoclimate soussana et al 2012 but it simulates competition between populations of plants made of clones of the same species and distributed homogeneously therefore contrary to our model gemini is not able to simulate competition between plants in agroecosystems where weed distribution is often patchy rew and cousens 2001 connecting rscone and florsys required developping additional formalisms the allometric relationship we used to calculate the proportion of plant biomass allocated to roots is well known weiner 2004 wilson 1988b but was never parameterized for so many species with a unique formalism we also improved it in order to take into account that plants allocate more biomass to roots under nitrogen deficiency other additional formalisms were more original because they had to link different approaches chosen by the respective teams that developed florsys and rscone for example we combined agronomical knowledge on soil structure synthetized in florsys to knowledge on the developmental biology of roots from rscone in order to predict the effect of soil compaction on root growth generally this effect is estimated empirically from measures of penetrometer resistance bengough et al 2011 colombi et al 2018 or bulk density brisson et al 2003 we used a more mechanistic approach that allowed for example to simulate that roots grow more easily in a compact soil that has been fragmented by tillage than in a continuously compact soil tardieu 1994 however this approach did not allow us to model shrinkage cracks whereas they allow roots to attain resources below compact soil layers hasegawa and sato 1987 modelling shrinkage cracks would require a very fine scale representation of the soil sánchez et al 2014 which is not compatible with our modelling purposes at the field scale our work shows that simulation models are useful to synthetize current knowledge from different approaches and disciplines however linking such different approaches required to make some assumptions for which no quantitative measurements were available e g we assumed that only half the proportion of bδ contributed to block root growth fortunately our simulations showed that in the context we tested i e a few cropping systems and a local pedoclimate and weed flora of burgundy parameters from our additional formalisms had only a limited influence on the model outputs except for parameters from the allometric relationship so our assumptions seem acceptable moreover the model was shown to correctly predict the daily and multiannual weed dynamics as well as crop production the evaluation step comparing simulations to independent observations constitutes another original aspect of our work because it is rarely done for models particularly for weed dynamics models holst et al 2007 including the root submodel improved the overall prediction quality of florsys and this even without detailed root system architecture or functions simulating soil resource uptake and use because there was less overestimation in terms of biomass as suspected by colbach et al 2016 therefore when parameterizing new species only parameters of the allometric relationship need to be measured precisely in priority given the genericity of the allometric relationship and the low influence of other formalisms we developed our approach could easily be adapted for connecting other models benefitting from parameters already acquired in our study for 30 species of crops and weeds for the allometric relationship however further simulations with a large diversity of cropping systems and pedoclimatic and floristic contexts must be run first to define in which conditions our formalisms and conclusions apply 4 2 what are the parameters involved in potential uptake of soil resources and root parasitism risk species parameters were more correlated to proxies for uptake of soil resources and root parasitism for crops than for weeds for the latter proxy variables were the result of a community of interacting species and parameters rather than of individual species or parameters therefore links between proxy variables and parameters were less obvious for weeds and could even seem counter intuitive for example weed communities most likely to be infected by p ramosa in autumn i e communities with the largest cumulated root length consisted mostly of species that did not invest much in roots and that explored the soil only at short distance instead they invested in strategically placed leaf area after emergence above neighbours to occupy space as fast as possible and shade their neighbours rather than be shaded as illustrated by their low shading response indeed occupying the field area as quickly as possible is crucial for a plant to survive and grow within a community colbach et al 2019 liebman and gallandt 1997 particularly if soil resources are assumed to be mostly non limiting as in the present case in terms of belowground exploration the fine scale seemed most important for parasitism of weeds because root length density was the key parameter as demonstrated by the specific root length parameter rather than root system volume depending on root system lateral extension this is consistent with literature reporting that large specific root length is a crucial trait for belowground exploration because it allows to explore greater soil volumes per unit of biomass invested in roots ma et al 2018 in contrast to weeds in terms of morphology and photosynthetic functioning the crops most likely to be infected in autumn were large both above and belowground and very plastic in response to shade all along their life cycle therefore it is likely that for crops which are deliberately sown and promoted by farming practices to the detriment of weeds exerting a strong competition once established is as at least as important as being able to establish quickly in summer key parameters for parasitism risk and potential soil resource uptake were different and more difficult to interpret for example for crops they were characteristics of winter cereals it is difficult to tell whether these characteristics did promote parasitism risk and potential uptake or whether this reflected the way we estimated missing parameters i e by averaging parameters by clade and seasonal type generally root parameters were less influent than aboveground parameters in our simulations this is not surprising considering that the florsys rscone function was one way here with rscone root variables driven by florsys state variables but the feedback from rscone to florsys i e root dependent functions are not modelled yet except for remobilization uptake of soil resources and p ramosa infection have a retroactive effect on plant growth respectively beneficial and detrimental barker et al 1996 lins et al 2007 weiner 2004 which could amplify the influence of root parameters to complete the two way connection between rscone and florsys we recently included these key root dependent functions i e plant plant competition for nitrogen moreau et al 2000 submitted and p ramosa infection pointurier et al n d submitted and their effects on plant growth and morphology into florsys however even after implementing such root functions in the model aboveground parameters could still be more influential than root parameters because soil resource uptake berger et al 2013 and the number of broomrapes supported by their hosts grenz et al 2008 are driven by the aboveground parts of plants it is noteworthy that our proxies quantify potential parasitism and soil resource uptake but disregard major aspects involved such as nitrogen uptake efficiency of plants aziz et al 2017 or host status qasem and foy 2007 which we are currently implementing in the model 4 3 agronomic implications as potential soil resource uptake was strongly correlated to the risk of parasitism in the simulations it will often be difficult to both improve crop nutrition and reduce p ramosa infection in situations where the latter is an issue however it is possible because the crops with the highest potential uptake were cereals which generally do not host p ramosa parker 2013 some species of cereals could even contribute to control p ramosa by depleting the parasite seed bank because they are false hosts e g oat avena sativa fernández aparicio et al 2009 i e they stimulate p ramosa germination but do not support its development goldwasser and rodenburg 2013 in the case of cover crops the correlation between increased soil resource uptake and increased p ramosa infection is actually an opportunity to reduce both nitrate leaching and p ramosa seed banks indeed the principle of p ramosa catch crops is to promote p ramosa infection on host crops to reduce the parasite seed bank and destroy the infected crops before p ramosa reproduction goldwasser and rodenburg 2013 our approach allows identifying ideotypes of crops i e theoretical ideal crop plants that combine all the characteristics required to reach one or several goals in a production situation martre et al 2015 here greater soil exploration abilities for example breeding less vigorous varieties which would be less likely to encounter p ramosa seeds would be a solution for host crops such as oilseed rape for which no parasite resistance has yet been found fernández aparicio et al 2016 however such varieties would be less competitive for soil resources against non parasitic weeds and their benefits would depend on whether parasitic or non parasitic weeds were the main limiting factor identifying ideotypes is also interesting for designing crop mixtures for example we showed that mixing winter cereals with dicotyledons which take up potentially fewer soil resources according to our simulations is relevant under limited water and nutrient supply another option is to mix species that explore complementary niches for example one taking up superficially and the other one more in depth postma and lynch 2012 our approach could be adapted to identify such mixtures the trade off between soil resource uptake and p ramosa control is interesting for weed management it means that strategies targeting resources hungry weed species e g deep banding fertilization that limits nutrient uptake by weeds to the advantage of crops blackshaw et al 2004 also control weeds that favour p ramosa infection the latter could though be achieved by different management strategies as we showed that interactions between different species with different parameters are very important within the weed community for example limiting broomrape infestation via weeds could be achieved either by directly controlling massively infected weed species as generally advised www terresinovia fr en savoir plus sur l orobanche rameuse or by tolerating non host weeds that compete with the latter colbach et al 2017a simulating a large number of cropping systems with our model could help to better understand the link between cropping techniques and proxies and to identify different efficient strategies including complex ones relying on interactions between weed species 5 conclusion by connecting a root model to a weed dynamics model we developed one of the rare plant dynamics model adapted to take into account competition for all resources light water and nutrients in multispecies heterogeneous stands we focused on weed dynamics in agroecosystems but our approach is sufficiently generic to be adapted to crop models aiming at designing crop mixtures for example we also propose a method to identify major plant characteristics involved in competition between crops and weeds for soil resources which could be adapted for designing crops mixtures we used proxies for competition for soil resources and for parasitism of crops and weeds and the results will help to implement the actual processes in florsys this will ultimately make florsys a powerful tool for designing agroecological cropping systems it will allow testing complex strategies that modulate competitive relationships between crops weeds and broomrape via e g sowing dates and patterns or fertilization credit authorship contribution statement olivia

24679,reducing pesticide use in agriculture is essential but involves shifting towards more complex agroecosystems plant canopies are expected to be more heterogeneous because a more abundant weed flora is likely to remain in low herbicide fields and because intercropping i e mixing various crops species or varieties is a promising option to reduce chemical inputs simulation models are useful to understand and design complex agroecological cropping systems but they rarely represent the root systems of plants however belowground processes such as competition for soil resources or infection by root parasitic plants are key determinants of the structure of plant communities the aim of our study was to develop a model that simulates heterogeneous 3d individual based crop weed canopies from cropping system and pedoclimate and that will ultimately be used to design agroecological cropping systems therefore we 1 connected a root system model rscone to a weed dynamics model florsys in order to include both above and belowground parts of plants 2 evaluated the prediction quality of our model and 3 analysed the influence of species parameters on potential soil resource uptake and root infection by parasitic plants we used the well known allometric relationship between root and total plant biomass to connect rscone and florsys and we created new formalisms to model the effect of soil compaction on root growth our model was shown to correctly predict long term weed dynamics in various cropping systems from step 3 we characterized crops and weed communities that are potentially competitive for soil resources and most likely to be infected by parasitic plants and we deduced agronomic recommendations for example species emerging and occupying the soil quickly were the most likely to relay broomrape infestation and control of such species should take precedence although we focussed on crop weed competition our approach can be applied to other heterogeneous canopies for designing crop mixtures for example keywords soil resources competition parasitic plants heterogeneous stands weed management 1 introduction weeds can greatly reduce yields and harvest quality both directly by competing with the crop for light nutrients and water oerke 2006 and indirectly by serving as alternative hosts for pests norris 2005 or increasing workload for the farmer for example mézière et al 2015 weeds are mostly controlled by herbicides but this practice must be drastically reduced because of its detrimental side effects on environment and human health novotny 1999 non chemical cropping techniques such as diversifying crop rotation or soil tillage are efficient to control weeds provided that several are combined because their effects are partial liebman and gallandt 1997 among them growing mixtures of crop species is a promising weed management strategy because they are often more competitive than sole crops towards weeds liebman et al 2001 as a result reducing herbicide use is likely to make agricultural fields more heterogeneous with more diverse crop stands and possibly a more abundant residual weed flora managing weeds in such heterogeneous stands requires understanding competition among plants in order to minimize the damage caused by weeds and to maximise the yield and competitiveness of crop mixtures light is the major source of competition between plants in agroecosystems if fertilization provides non limiting soil resources wilson 1988a however as mineral fertilization must be reduced because of its environmental impact raun and johnson 1999 and as droughts become more frequent due to climate change turral et al 2011 competition for soil resources is likely to increase in agricultural fields soil ressource use can also be impacted by soil borne root pests such as root infecting fungi macdonald and gutteridge 2012 or root parasitic plants e g branched broomrape phelipanche ramosa l pomel parker 2013 which moreover can be hosted by weeds gibot leclerc et al 2003 therefore considering belowground competition between plants becomes crucial for designing efficient weed management strategies as each plant is likely to be surrounded by various neighbours with different abilities to compete different species and morphologies at different developmental stages different locations understanding competition relationships in heterogeneous stands involves going down to the individual plant scale given the multiple techniques to implement and the number and diversity of plants to consider managing weeds in a context of herbicide reduction is very complex and requires adapted tools moreover these tools must take into account the variability in effects depending on pedoclimatic conditions and in the long term because weed seeds persist for several years in the soil simulation models are useful tools to design cropping systems that manage such complexity bergez et al 2010 renton and chauhan 2017 models with a 3d individual based representation of plants are particularly adapted for heterogeneous stands because they allow to simulate the competition exerted on each plant in a field from all its neighbours gaudio et al 2019 renton 2013 renton and chauhan 2017 mechanistic models which are process based may easily be adapted to a great diversity of plant species because of their generic structure colbach 2010 however very few of such models include both above and belowground parts of plants so they represent competition between plants only partially gaudio et al 2019 renton and chauhan 2017 this is also the case of the florsys model colbach et al 2014 gardarin et al 2012 munier jolain et al 2014 2013 for example to our knowledge it is to date the only mechanistic model quantifying the effects of cropping systems on the dynamics of multispecies weed floras for decades in interaction with pedoclimatic conditions holst et al 2007 therefore this model is useful to design and evalueate sustainable weed management strategies colbach et al 2017b 2018 or crop ideotypes colbach et al 2019 it simulates the competition between crops and weeds for light by representing each individual crop and weed plant in 3d in a virtual field and their shading effect on each other s growth and morphological plasticity colbach et al 2014 munier jolain et al 2014 2013 however florsys ignores plant roots and belowground processes such as uptake of soil resources or root infection by soil borne pests to do so it must be connected to a root growth model with the following characteristics 1 having a 3d individual based representation of root systems 2 being sufficiently simple for multiannual simulations of thousands of plants in a field 3 being parameterized for most common crop and weed species encountered in agroecosystems and relatively easy to parameterize for new species and 4 predicting the key state variables that drive water and nutrient uptake and infection by parasitic plants i e root biomass and length density in the soil grenz et al 2005 malagoli and le deunff 2014 the recently developed rscone model is the only one in the literature meeting all required criteria pagès et al 2020 rscone is a metamodel i e a simplified model derived from a pre existing more complex model whose structure and parameter values were derived from a root system architecture model archisimple pagès et al 2014 it represents the root system of individual plants from four state variables as an envelop where root density is distributed across soil layers rscone is already parameterized for 35 crop and weed species using a relatively low number of parameters 22 with a biological meaning that can be estimated from archisimple simulations thus benefitting from experience on root system architecture models and specific parameterization work of the archisimple community bui et al 2015 drouet et al 2005 drouet and pagès 2003 dunbabin et al 2013 faverjon et al 2019 moreau et al 2017 pagès et al 2014 pagès and kervella 2018 pagès and picon cochard 2014 the objectives of this study were to study the determinants of soil resource uptake and root infection by parasitic plants by 1 connecting florsys and rscone to obtain a plant dynamics model that represents both above and belowground parts of plants in agroecosystems 2 by evaluating the predictive power of the new florsys rscone model by comparing simulation results to indepedent field observations 3 by identifying the key plant parameters involved in soil resource uptake and root infection by parasitic plants from simulation results and 4 by deducing from the latter step which parameters must be measured precisely when parameterizing new species and which processes the most influence soil resources competition and parasitism step 3 also allowed us to deduce agronomic recommendations the present paper does not yet model soil resource uptake and use or impact of root parasitic plants on host growth which will be presented in future papers moreau et al 2000 submitted pointurier et al n d 2 material and methods 2 1 model structures 2 1 1 the weed dynamics model florsys florsys is a mechanistic model i e a model that considers processes of the life cycle of annual crops and weeds that determine their multiannual dynamics it has been described in detail in other studies colbach et al 2014 gardarin et al 2012 munier jolain et al 2014 2013 we present here a quick summary of the model the user inputs data describing the virtual field to be simulated e g soil texture latitude weather temperature rainfall and radiation cropping techniques including crop sequence and initial weed flora at the beginning of the simulation from this information florsys predicts the weed seed bank and the density and biomass of weed and crop plants daily in the virtual field florsys represents each individual whether crop or weed plant seed the same way and affected by the same processes processes relevant for seeds in the soil are mortality dormancy and germination which are driven respectively by seed age season and soil climate seedlings emerge provided that the seeds are sufficiently close to the soil surface and that the soil is sufficiently moist and warm without compact soil clods blocking shoot growth these belowground processes are represented vertically over horizontally homogeneous 1 cm thick soil layers down to a depth of 30 cm soil climate and structure are predicted by the soil submodels of stics brisson et al 2003 and déciblé chatelin et al 2005 respectively included in florsys from emergence onwards plant phenology is driven by temperature with thermal time from emergence to flowering depending on the month during which plants reach the onset of vegetative stage soon after emergence depending on the species and emergence season flowering is indefinitely postponed to account for missing vernaliziation plant growth results from the accumulation of biomass by photosynthesis after removing losses due to respiration biomass accumulated daily is shared among aboveground organs i e leaves stems and seeds photosynthesis depends on the amount of photosynthetically active radiation par intercepted by plants depending on plant morphology and shading due to neighbouring plants to model this plant plant interaction each plant whether crop or weed is represented in three dimensions aboveground and located inside the field each plant is modelled as a cylinder the dimensions of which are defined by the height and width of the plant with leaf area distributed along plant height tillage and mechanical weeding operations move seeds in the soil and kill part of germinated seeds and plants plants may also die from frost herbicide applications or ageing in total 41 crop species or varieties including both cash and cover crops as well as 26 weed species are parameterized in florsys 2 1 2 the root system model rscone the rscone model has been described by pagès et al 2020 from daily inputs detailing allocation of biomass to roots soil constraint on root growth and soil temperature in each soil layer rscone predicts the root system dimensions of a plant daily together with the distribution of root biomass and root lengths shaded lines in table s1 in section a online the root system is depicted in three dimensions as a cylinder on top of a spilled cone inside which root density is distributed the dimensions of the root system envelop grow over time and are limited by soil compaction and low temperatures root biomass is calculated by confronting the biomass demand from roots which is determined by the root system dimensions to the biomass supply given as input root biomass is then distributed into each soil layer within the root system envelop assuming a homogeneous distribution within each layer and a linear decrease with depth from a maximal value at soil surface down to 0 at the root system tip root length density is determined by multiplying root biomass density by the specific root length srl twenty one weed species and 23 crop species or varieties are parameterized in rscone 2 1 3 new functions and parameters to connect rscone and florsys integrating rscone as a submodel of florsys required connecting both models at the connecting functions described below and in figure 1 florsys runs at the field scale representing a canopy as a collection of individual crop and weed plants limited to their above ground part rscone runs at the plant scale only representing the below ground part of a single plant this was grafted here below the above ground florsys plant making the two models connect at the scale of the individual plant exchanging information with a daily time step for now most of the connection is one way i e florsys variables are used as inputs of rscone root functions such as nutrient uptake will be implemented in another paper here only biomass remobilization from below to aboveground after disturbances such as mowing or frost are considered 2 1 4 phenology rscone and florsys both run with a daily time step but they use different time units for plant age in rscone plant age is given in days since germination under optimal temperature optimal days florsys uses two scales thermal time in c days with base temperature depending on species since plant emergence and plant stage cotyledon plantlet vegetative flowering onset maturity onset death with the duration of the vegetative stage depending on the plant s emergence season conversions had to be done to make optimal days of rscone compatible with thermal time in florsys see 1 in figure 1 2 1 5 soil constraint on root growth in rscone soil conditions can limit root system extension in width and depth if the soil is too cold or too compacted pagès et al 2020 rscone uses soil temperature as an input which will now be provided by florsys for connecting both models conversely rscone does not directly use soil structure variables as input but an abstract coefficient of root growth limitation by the soil ranging from 0 no root growth to 1 no soil constraint in each soil layer here we added a function to quantify this soil constraint from soil structure variables see 2 in figure 1 predicted by florsys from soil texture tillage soil moisture and frost 2 1 6 allocation of biomass to roots allocation of biomass to roots is an input of the rscone model and must be provided by florsys root biomass is known to be correlated to total plant biomass weiner 2004 wilson 1988a therefore we aimed at finding a relationship to calculate biomass allocated to roots from the aboveground biomass of plants predicted by florsys see 3 in figure 1 we collected data from different experiments described in table 1 to investigate this relationship we used data collected on a large range of crop and weed species including experiments testing the effect of nitrogen and light on root growth the relationship between root and total plant biomass of plants was analysed as a function of the effects of species nitrogen and light treatments with the following model using the function lm of r r core team 2019 and type iii sum of squares to ensure orthogonal constrasts 1 log 10 root biomass constant log 10 total plant biomass species nitrogen stress index light two way interactions residuals the nitrogen stress index was calculated as explained in perthame et al 2020 when plant nitrogen nutrition is optimal the nitrogen stress index is close to zero and nitrogen stress increases with the index value equation 1 was applied to the data from experiment e1 in table 1 in other experiments listed in table 1 the nitrogen stress index was not calculated and the effect of light was not tested only the nitrogen treatments listed in table 1 that we knew from previous experiments that gave near optimal plant nitrogen nutrition were kept for the analysis the following model was fitted to the data 2 log 10 root biomass constant log 10 total plant biomass species two way interaction residuals as data came from various experiments the effect of the experimental set up was also tested 3 log 10 root biomass constant log 10 total plant biomass species experiment two way interaction except species experiment residuals the interaction between species and experimental set up could not be tested because the experiments did not have enough species in common models were fitted by backward selection note that in legume species root biomass did not include nodule biomass since nodules only constituted a small part of belowground plant biomass under optimal nitrogen nutrition 4 and are not modelled in florsys 2 1 7 remobilization from roots to aboveground biomass when part of the aboveground plant biomass is destroyed by events such as frost or mowing plants change their source sink relationships and remobilize resources from the root compartment toward the aboveground compartments see 4 in figure 1 here this was approximated by changing the biomass allocation and respiration rates see section 3 1 3 according to preliminary simulation results not shown damages due to frost were overestimated we improved the model predictions by including a snow submodel to simulate the insulating effect of snow cover that protects plants from frost damages jégo et al 2014 trnka et al 2010 section b1 online 2 2 testing the new florsys rscone model with simulations 2 2 1 principle simulations of cropping systems were performed with florsys rscone to 1 evaluate the model by comparing simulation results to independent field observations section 2 3 2 and 2 identify key species parameters for potential soil resource uptake and infection by root parasitic plants section 2 3 3 data of ten cropping systems from the inrae experimental station of dijon époisses from 1999 to 2012 were simulated as described in colbach et al 2016 section c online they vary from herbicide intensive to herbicide free with various rotations tillage strategies and use of mechanical weeding initial weed seedbank for 25 weed species and soil characteristics given as inputs in the model were measured on soil samples taken in the fields weather data were obtained from the inrae weather station via the inrae platform climatik in french managed by the agroclim laboratory of avignon france https intranet inrae fr climatik each cropping system was repeated 10 times with the same inputs to take into account the stochastic effects of florsys in total 10 cropping systems 10 repetitions 100 simulation runs were carried out each over 13 years the simulated field sample was 6 4m² as the evaluation of the first florsys version showed the phenology submodel to badly predict flowering dates of weeds in the south of france and of some crop varieties colbach et al 2016 a corrective patch was added to keep weeds from flowering too early and to force crops to mature at harvest date not all florsys species have yet been parameterized in rscone in that case default parameter values were calculated by averaging parameters of species from the same clade i e monocotyledon or dicotyledon as clade was shown to discriminate rscone parameters pagès et al 2020 and from the same seasonal type i e winter annuals summer annuals or perennials 2 2 2 model evaluation aboveground plant biomass weed plant density weed seed bank and crop yield were measured in all ten fields during the 13 years of the trial and compared to variables predicted by florsys rscone as explained in colbach et al 2016 density and aboveground biomass were measured in several quadrats per field several times a year and weed seed bank was measured on ten soil samples every two years as root biomass was not measured we could not directly evaluate the prediction quality of roots in our model instead we checked whether including roots improved the prediction quality of aboveground variables by florsys variables were either analysed 1 at the species scale or 2 at the community scale i e they were summed over all species the prediction quality of the model was estimated with various complementary criteria described in colbach et al 2016 the prediction bias is the mean of residuals simulated y i observed values y i with i in 1 n from different fields years and species and determines whether the model systematically under or overestimated variables it was calculated relatively to the range of variation of observations i e divided by half the difference between the maximum and minimum observed values maxobs and minobs b i a s i y i y i n m a x o b s m i n o b s 2 the relative root square of the mean square error rrmsep evaluates the relative prediction error of the model it was calculated relatively to the standard deviation of observed values stdevobs coucheney et al 2015 colbach et al 2016 and corrected for variability in observations i e variability due to measurement errors varobs and in simulations i e variability due to model stochasticity varsim wallach 2006 r r m s e p msep v a r o b s v a r s i m s t d e v o b s m s e p 1 n i y i y i 2 v a r o b s 1 n q i q y i y i q where yiq is the observed variable in quadrat q for individual i from one field one day one species and q 4 the number of quadrats per field day v a r s i m 1 n r i r y i y i q where y i q is the simulated variable in repetition r for individual i and r 10 the number of repetitions per field day stdevobs 1 n y i y 2 where y is the mean of observations if msep is small or smaller than varobs and varsim the difference between observed and simulated values is mostly due to respectively observation error and or model stochasticity the ability of the model to rank cropping systems and weed species correctly was calculated as the maximum between the modelling efficiency the pearson and the spearman correlation coefficients between observations and predictions coefficients close to 1 indicate that the variables are well predicted by the model in terms of absolute values relative values i e differences between values and ranks respectively the three criteria relative bias rrmsep and proportion of correctly predicted observation were calculated from data averaged over the rotation i e over all simulated values or measurements per cropping system to check the model s ability to compare cropping systems to assess how well the model predicts outputs on a given day the criteria were calculated from data averaged per day i e averaged over quadrats samples and repetition except for daily weed density and biomass for these two outputs the proportion of correctly predicted observations was the proportion of observations inside the simulated 90 confidence interval obtained over the 10 repetitions this criterion was preferred over the three first evaluation criteria because the latter are considerably deteriorated by a delay of a few days in the simulations vs the observations or vice versa whereas such delays do not affect the prediction quality of the weed dynamics over the years colbach et al 2016 all the evaluation criteria were also calculated from simulations with florsys before the rscone model was connected in order to study whether the connection improved florsys predictions 2 2 3 potential soil resource uptake and risk of parasitism in order to study which species parameters determine potential soil resource uptake and risk of infection by p ramosa we analysed proxy variables see details below because these processes were not yet modelled in florsys at the time of this study we did not considered characteristics relative to root functioning when calculating our proxies e g host status or uptake efficiency because they are not yet included focussing on the influence of the morphology and the photosynthetic functioning of plants on root exploration root biomass summed over respectively all crop and weed plants was used as a proxy for potential soil resource uptake by crops and weeds malagoli and le deunff 2014 it was taken at the beginning of crop flowering when crop root biomass is near maximal gregory et al 1995 in order to get a global overview of root growth over the crop cycle the percentage of crop root volume overlapped by root systems of weeds was also calculated at crop flowering and averaged over the field in order to estimate crop weed competition for soil resources p ramosa is a holoparasitic non photosynthesizing root infecting plant whose seeds follow a seasonal dormancy pattern when buried in the soil and germinate when triggered by root exudates of host plants the parasite then attaches to roots of a host plant grows to the detriment of that host which usually dies without reproducing and produces a huge number of seeds that replenish the seed bank parker 2013 here the risk of infection by root parasitic plants such as p ramosa was approximated by the cumulated root length of crops and weeds grenz et al 2005 because parasitic seeds only germinate close to host roots 4 mm in order to infect them quickly otherwise they die in a few days joel 2013 only crops and weeds roots in the first 30 cm of soil were considered because parasitic seeds are unlikely to be buried deeper by tillage this proxy was calculated in autumn end of november and summer end of june when parasitic seeds are most likely to germinate before and after dormancy respectively pointurier et al 2019 as well as at crop flowering when host root exudation stops auger et al 2012 in order to analyse the relationships between species parameters and proxy variables for soil resource uptake and parasitism an rlq analysis combined with a fourth corner analysis was performed for weeds and pearson correlations were calculated for crops as in colbach et al 2019 the rlq analysis was performed with the library ade4 of r dray and dufour 2007 it consisted in relating three tables r l and q in order to study the relationships between our proxy variables described in table r e g total weed root biomass for soil resource uptake by weeds and the species parameters in table q while taking into account the relative contribution of each species within the weed community given by maximum annual weed species densities in table l table l consisted of the maximum densities of weed species over the growing cycle i e from sowing to harvest for each simulated year each cropping system and each repetition table q consisted of the root parameters described in table s2 in section a online and the aboveground parameters described in colbach et al 2019 were added to investigate the relative influence of the two types of parameters the significance of the correlations obtained in the rlq analysis was tested with a fourth corner analysis with 999 permutations of rows and columns in table l the latter procedure allowed to check that the correlations observed did show a relationship between proxy variables and parameters and that they were not affected by preferential distributions of weed species depending on cropping systems or on their parameters results of the rlq analysis were displayed with the package adegraphics of r siberchicot et al 2017 pearson correlations between crop proxy variables and parameters were calculated with the function rcorr from the package hmisc of r a principal component analysis pca was performed on proxy variables with the function pca from the library factominer lê et al 2008 and displayed using the function fviz pca var from the library factoextra of r parameters were projected as supplementary variables on the correlation circle i e they were not used for calculations in the pca to illustrate their relationship with the proxy variables proxy variables for both crops and weeds were log transformed prior to analysis because they were skewed 3 results 3 1 integration of rscone as a root distribution submodel in florsys 3 1 1 phenology radicle growth and water uptake prior to seedling emergence was already included in florsys in a previous work gardarin et al 2012 before emergence nitrogen uptake is negligible fayaud et al 2014 and no germination stimulants for parasitic plants are exudated gibot leclerc et al 2012 therefore we focused on post emergent root system development we considered that the post emergent root system starts to grow from the moment the plant emerges in florsys and we readjusted the relevant rscone timing parameters accordingly eq 2 in table s1 in section a online we recalibrated rscone durations expressed in optimal days to account for the season of emergence of the plant eq 3 in table s1 in section a online we considered that the season of emergence giving the shortest life cycle duration in florsys reflects plant development under optimal temperature and thus correspond to the rscone durations a plant emerging at a different season has a longer life cycle in florsys and the ratio of this longer duration to the minimum duration was used to lengthen the rscone root stage durations the effect of soil temperature on root system expansion was included in the rsoildls variables reflecting structural and thermal constraints in the soil see section 3 1 2 the timing of root system stages influences both the root system expansion eq 10 and 11 taken from pagès et al 2020 and its root density eq 31 and 32 taken from pagès et al 2020 3 1 2 effect of soil limiting factors on root growth root growth limitation by soil compaction was calculated from soil structure in florsys soil structure is predicted for the top three 10 cm soil layers as the proportion of soil clods distinguished by their degree of compaction and the process they were formed roger estrade et al 2004 types bδ and cδ are the most compact and block root growth contrary to cδ clods bδ clods are partially fragmented so they do not completely block root growth stones whose proportion in the soil is given as an input in florsys are assumed to have the same effect as cδ clods on root growth in the top soil layers up to 30 cm depth equation 4 in table s1 in section a online was based on these assumptions root growth is reduced proportionally to the proportion of stones bδ and cδ soil clods in the soil only half the proportion of bδ soil clods was considered in this equation to roughly take into account that they do not completely block root growth this sum was divided by 1 stone proportion to fit into 0 1 as the clod proportions are given by florsys relatively to total soil volume disregarding stones the results is then multiplied by a 50 factor rsmax borrowed from the stics crop model contrdamax brisson et al 2003 2002 brisson et al 1998 which correspond to the maximal reduction the soil can exert on root growth the result or rather 1 this result to get a corrective factor for root growth was multiplied by a species parameter pens reflecting the species ability to penetrate the soil as soil structure and temperature are not predicted below 30 cm in florsys soil constraint in deeper soil layers was predicted from soil variables at 30 cm depth eq 5 and 7 in table s1 in section a online the effects of soil compaction and temperature were then combined to get the total soil constraint growth in each layer eq 8 taken from pagès et al 2020 and applied to reduce root system dimensions proportionally eq 9 to 15 taken from pagès et al 2020 as soil constraint was applied to the entire root system every day in rscone and not only to new roots it could happen that a sudden high soil constraint for example compaction due to tractor wheels on a wet soil or a drop in temperature could dramatically shrink the root system from one day to another we added a condition to prevent such root system shrinkage eq 13 14 and 15 in table s1 in section a online because it was unrealistic apart in case of frost 3 1 3 biomass allocation to roots 3 1 3 1 data analysis in experiment e1 table 1 root biomass was strongly correlated to total plant biomass irrespective of species light condition or nitrogen stress index partial r2 63 of total r2 p 0 02 section d 1 online figure 2 the latter three factors i e species light and nitrogen stress index as well as two way interactions had a significant effect p 0 001 except for the interaction between total plant biomass and nitrogen stress index however the effect of light was negligible partial r² 14 of total r2 section d 1 online given the huge difference between shading levels i e 0 vs 90 and was removed from the model then data on fescue which had been removed from the analysis because it did not allow testing the effect of light see table 1 was included in the analysis the effect of the interaction between nitrogen stress index and species was also removed because it was negligible partial r² 0 23 of total r2 particularly compared to the primary effects of these variables and mainly due to one species i e fescue section d 2 online finally the following linear model was obtained section d 3 online 4 log 10 root biomass a 1 s a 2 s log 10 total plant biomass a 3 nitrogen stress index residuals where a1s a2s and a3 are parameters described in table s2 in section a online with a1s and a2s depending on the species in other experiments where the nitrogen stress index was not calculated parameters a1s and a2s were determined by fitting equation 2 from section 2 2 3 a strong linear relationship was also found with this model and data r² 0 98 figure 3 even though experiments with very different protocols were included in the analysis the effect of the experiment was found significant but negligible compared to the species effect partial r² 1 and 7 of total r2 respectively p 0 001 section d 4 online as parameter a3 did not depend on the species the value determined with equation 4 from the e1 experiment was used for all species even if parameters a1s and a2s were estimated on different experiments although we only used data obtained during vegetative stages data from other experiments showed that the relationship we found between root and total plant biomass remained valid at earlier and later stages section d 5 online 3 1 3 2 formalism used to connect florsys and rscone model 4 was used to calculate the root biomass ratio i e the ratio of the plant root biomass to its total biomass rbrdsi depending on species and nitrogen stress index this ratio was used to connect florsys and rscone eq 20 and 23 in table s1 in section a online in florsys plant growth is modelled differently depending on whether the plant is surrounded by shading neighbouring plants or not before plants start to compete for light i e at early stages generally less than 15 days after emergence munier jolain et al 2014 aboveground biomass accumulation is driven solely by thermal time since emergence colbach et al 2014 we added an equation to calculate the amount of biomass allocated to roots in rscone from the aboveground biomass predicted by florsys and the root biomass ratio rbrdsi eq 21 in table s1 in section a online we assumed that nitrogen stress was negligible i e a3 set to 0 in eq 20 in table s1 in section a online because it was not observed in such young plants perthame et al 2020 when plants start to compete for light in florsys they grow by accumulating biomass from photosynthesis daily losing some through respiration eq 22 in table s1 in section a online we used the resulting total plant biomass of the day to calculate the root biomass ratio rbrdsi eq 23 in table s1 in section a online and deduced the daily amount of photosynthesized biomass to be allocated to roots eq 24 in table s1 in section a online the remaining amount of photosynthesized biomass was allocated to aboveground organs then we calculated the part of biomass that was lost through respiration by roots and by aboveground organs respectively from the beginning of flowering onward when plants stop to allocate new biomass to roots gregory et al 1995 root biomass was assumed to be remobilized for aboveground organs the same occurred after plants lost aboveground biomass due to mowing eq 17 in table s1 in section a online or frost damage eq 18 in table s1 in section a online as long as the biomass level from before that event was not reached again eq 19 in table s1 in section a online this remobilization was modelled by charging respiration losses from both roots and aboveground organs to roots and by allocating all biomass gained by photosynthesis to aboveground organs only eq 25 in table s1 in section a online for very small plants because of the log log relationship root biomass could mathematically exceed total plant biomass i e rbrdsi 1 to avoid this biological non sense we added a condition to limit rbrdsi to the maximum root to total biomass ratio observed in our data eq 20 and 23 in table s1 in section a online 3 2 simulation results 3 2 1 crop production and multiannual species weed dynamics are well predicted by florsys rscone we compared simulations by florsys rscone to independent observations from the cropping system trial to determine the prediction quality and domain of validity of the model this showed that weed variables were generally well predicted at the species scale table 2 a and b with a small bias 7 17 more than 50 up to 67 of well ranked observations and very good predictions of daily dynamics more than 80 of observations within the simulated confidence interval however predictions were less good at the community scale particularly for seed bank and aboveground biomass spearman coefficients of 0 08 and 0 13 respectively because they were generally largely overestimated relative bias ranging from 15 to 206 and more than 50 of daily observations lower than the simulated confidence interval only multiannual weed density was as well ranked at the community scale as at the species scale pearson coefficient of 0 65 and 0 67 respectively crop variables were satisfactorily predicted table 2 b with crop biomass in particular well ranked with no bias crop yield was less well predicted with a slight underestimation and a high prediction error although the model was bad at predicting yield absolute values it correctly ranked cropping systems and years i e it could predict correctly that yield in cropping system x on year a was better than in cropping system y on year b for example 3 2 2 modelling roots improves the predictions of florsys comparing florsys simulations carried out with or without rscone to the independent field observations showed that integrating rscone partly allowed correct ing florsys deficiencies the additioinal submodel greatly improved the predictions of weed aboveground biomass prediction error largely decreased per species by 347 which is now better ranked bias decreased by 70 and spearman coefficients increased by 0 11 table 2 the predictions of weed densities and crop production did not improve nor deteriorate overall weed seed bank and crop yield were slightly less well predicted relative bias decreased by 6 and 4 respectively and modelling efficiency by 0 09 but this was negligible compared to variations due to model stochasticity observed between two simulations 3 1 and 0 04 respectively all other things being equal 3 2 3 crop parameters determining potential for soil resource competition and uptake and parasitism risk we investigated correlations among proxy variables for potential soil resource uptake i e total crop root biomass and parasitism risk i e total crop root length simulated by florsys rscone to see whether the same situations in terms of crop species cropping systems and weather conditions favoured the two root dependent functions both proxies were strongly correlated at crop flowering pearson correlation coefficient 0 85 in table 3 a and close points on the principal component analysis in section e 1 online which is also the stage when root growth stops in florsys rscone section 3 1 3 2 so though earlier resource uptake and parasitism risk might depend on different factors the same conditions determined the final cumulative outcome then we looked at correlations between the simulated root function proxies and the crop parameters entered into florsys rscone to identify which species features drove root dependent functions these correlations were found to be very strong absolute values of pearson correlation coefficients of 0 3 on average up to 0 7 major correlations in table 3 b h and complete results in section e 1 online and the proxies were associated to similar species parameters section e 1 online but despite investigating root dependent functions root parameters had less impact than parameters driving above ground morphology and shading response table 3 b vs table 4 c h in terms of plant structure crops potentially able of large uptakes of soil resources and most likely to be infected by p ramosa were mainly winter monocotyledons associated to winter annual and opposite to dicot species in table 3 f which present the longest growth duration resulting in more biomass production including root biomass and emerge when p ramosa seeds are non dormant these crops also present two other properties which are typical of winter crops i e their plants are little sensitive to frost low tfrostearly3 tfrostmid3 tfrostlate3 and their photosynthesis does not support high temperatures low tphoto3 the good nitrogen uptakers and the high parasite exposure crops also potentially explore a large soil volume i e their root systems presented a large cylinder shaped top high rcd their roots reached their maximal srl late high tsrlmax thus continuously increasing their exposure to p ramosa seeds per unit root length their plant height depended little on plant biomass low b hmmid and b hmlate resulting on homogeneously tall canopies which intercept more light and can thus can allocate more biomass to roots crops likely to suffer competition for soil resources from weeds i e the percentage of crop root volume overlapped by root systems of weeds tended to have the same species characteristics section e 1 online as good nitrogen uptakers indeed any feature that increases the root biomass and volume the proxy for nitrogen uptake also increases the probability of its overlapping with weed roots but correlations between the crop weed competition proxy and crop parameters were very weak absolute values of pearson correlation coefficients 0 3 section e 1 online as the crop weed root overlap also depended on weed characteristics different parameters drove risk of parasitism at different dates with opposite effects possible arrows perpendicular or in opposite directions on the pca in section e 1 online the strongest correlations with species parameters were found at dormancy induction of p ramosa seeds in autumn significant coefficients of 0 4 on average compared to 0 3 at the other dates section e 1 online the crops most likely to be infected then were characterized by early robust establishment adapted to autumn conditions good light interception and fast root system growth in detail they were dicotyledons table 3 which emerge better than monocotyledons particularly in compacted soil they had an epigeal germination requiring relatively wet conditions high basewp which are typical of autumn and their photosynthesis was sensitive to high temperatures low tphoto4 which is typical of winter crops they also grew quickly after emergence high rgr moreover the crops the most likely to be infected had large quickly growing root systems high emax rd and a2 thus increasing the probability of encountering p ramosa seeds although they allocated a low proportion of biomass to their roots low aa1 their plants were wide per unit biomass high wmmid and wmlate which increases soil coverage and thus light interception and root biomass production from flowering onwards the high risk crops allocated a larger proportion of their biomass to leaves high lbrlate again improving light interception which were located lower on the plant low rlhlate the high risk crops were also those that etiolated most when shaded by neighbour plants succeeding in maintaining light interception and biomass production they increased their plant height per unit biomass high mu hmearly allocated more biomass to stems low mu lbrearly mu lbrmid and mu lbrlate compensating with thinner larger leaves high mu slaearly and mu slamid which were shifted toward the plant top high mu rlhearly and mu rlhlate at dormancy release of p ramosa seeds in summer no strong correlations between proxy for parasitism and parameters could be identified table 3 at that time plant morphology is the cumulated result not only of species parameters but also of pedoclimatic conditions and cropping techniques which vary over the years the weather repetitions and the cropping systems 3 2 4 weed parameters determining potential for soil resource competition and uptake and parasitism risk in contrast to crops simulated root function proxies in weeds were positively correlated from early stages onwards table 4 a indicating that the same factors already drove root dependent functions much earlier in the season than for crops the correlations were again the largest in weeds at crop flowering pearson correlation coefficients 0 85 confirming that the same factors determined the final outcome in both root dependent functions correlations between simulated proxies and model parameters were weaker for multispecies weeds than for pure stand crops absolute values of correlation coefficients 0 2 table 4 b e compared to up to 0 7 in table 3 moreover in contrast to crops although the root function proxies were highly correlated in weeds they were not associated to the same species parameters indicating that other factors cropping system and or weather were more determinant only a predominantly low shade response after emergence within the weed community low mu slaearly increased both proxies risk of weed infection by p ramosa at crop flowering was moreover associated with weed species with more leaf area at their top high rlhearly and a low relative growth rate after emergence low rgr the multispecies nature of the weed community made it much more difficult to understand the reasons for these correlations such as the low rgr or the low mu slaearly which are detrimental to biomass production but in a multispecies community reducing one species type leaves niches for other species types that are driven by a combination of parameters which are not captured by the present analysis method rather than a single easy to identify parameter in contrast to crops no opposite effects were observed between weed parameters driving proxies for parasitism at different dates arrows in the same direction on the rlq axes in section e 2 online most key parameters were the same at crop flowering and at dormancy release of p ramosa seeds low rgr and high mu slaearly at both dates the proxy at the latter date was moreover associated with weed species with a low base temperature for germination and growth low baset which allow an earlier and faster root system growth the proxy for early weed infection in autumn at dormancy induction was correlated to several other weed species parameters table 4 b e there were six above ground parameters compared to only four root parameters indicating that root dependent functions depend at least as much on light interception than on root architecture weed infection was linked to weed species that allocated more biomass aboveground than to roots low root biomass ratio a2 that placed their large initial leaf area high la0 and slaearly above other plants thanks to a large allocation of biomass to stems low leaf biomass ratio lbrearly and a top distribution of the leaf area on the plant rlhearly high risk weed plants responded less to shade in terms of plant width and leaf area after emergence low mu wmearly and mu slaearly for these species having fine roots high srlmax increased the risk to encounter parasitic seeds more than exploring a large volume of soil as illustrated by low emax and re all these parameters were found to have a similar but much lower influence on the proxies for soil resource uptake and parasitism in summer correlation coefficients twice lower or not significant section e 2 online the proxy for competition exerted by weeds over crops for soil resources was the best correlated to two parameters of aboveground morphology last column of table 4 b e as for the proxy for soil resource uptake weed floras including many species with a low relative growth rate high rgr after emergence exerted potentially more competition towards crops competition was also increased by weeds that increased biomass allocation to leaves when shaded after emergence high mu lbrearly 4 discussion 4 1 what is new in our modelling approach by connecting two existing models rscone and florsys we developed the first plant dynamics model for heterogeneous multispecies canopies that 1 takes into account both aboveground and root compartments so that it could ultimately integrate competition between plants for all resources light water and nutrients 2 for as many as 56 species of crops and weeds interacting in a field 3 for several years 4 under the influence of cropping techniques and pedoclimate gaudio et al 2019 the major originality of our model is the individual based representation of plants in the competition submodel which makes it adapted for simulating heterogeneous stands for example gemini is another model which predicts the multiannual dynamics of multispecies plant stands under the influence of management techniques and pedoclimate soussana et al 2012 but it simulates competition between populations of plants made of clones of the same species and distributed homogeneously therefore contrary to our model gemini is not able to simulate competition between plants in agroecosystems where weed distribution is often patchy rew and cousens 2001 connecting rscone and florsys required developping additional formalisms the allometric relationship we used to calculate the proportion of plant biomass allocated to roots is well known weiner 2004 wilson 1988b but was never parameterized for so many species with a unique formalism we also improved it in order to take into account that plants allocate more biomass to roots under nitrogen deficiency other additional formalisms were more original because they had to link different approaches chosen by the respective teams that developed florsys and rscone for example we combined agronomical knowledge on soil structure synthetized in florsys to knowledge on the developmental biology of roots from rscone in order to predict the effect of soil compaction on root growth generally this effect is estimated empirically from measures of penetrometer resistance bengough et al 2011 colombi et al 2018 or bulk density brisson et al 2003 we used a more mechanistic approach that allowed for example to simulate that roots grow more easily in a compact soil that has been fragmented by tillage than in a continuously compact soil tardieu 1994 however this approach did not allow us to model shrinkage cracks whereas they allow roots to attain resources below compact soil layers hasegawa and sato 1987 modelling shrinkage cracks would require a very fine scale representation of the soil sánchez et al 2014 which is not compatible with our modelling purposes at the field scale our work shows that simulation models are useful to synthetize current knowledge from different approaches and disciplines however linking such different approaches required to make some assumptions for which no quantitative measurements were available e g we assumed that only half the proportion of bδ contributed to block root growth fortunately our simulations showed that in the context we tested i e a few cropping systems and a local pedoclimate and weed flora of burgundy parameters from our additional formalisms had only a limited influence on the model outputs except for parameters from the allometric relationship so our assumptions seem acceptable moreover the model was shown to correctly predict the daily and multiannual weed dynamics as well as crop production the evaluation step comparing simulations to independent observations constitutes another original aspect of our work because it is rarely done for models particularly for weed dynamics models holst et al 2007 including the root submodel improved the overall prediction quality of florsys and this even without detailed root system architecture or functions simulating soil resource uptake and use because there was less overestimation in terms of biomass as suspected by colbach et al 2016 therefore when parameterizing new species only parameters of the allometric relationship need to be measured precisely in priority given the genericity of the allometric relationship and the low influence of other formalisms we developed our approach could easily be adapted for connecting other models benefitting from parameters already acquired in our study for 30 species of crops and weeds for the allometric relationship however further simulations with a large diversity of cropping systems and pedoclimatic and floristic contexts must be run first to define in which conditions our formalisms and conclusions apply 4 2 what are the parameters involved in potential uptake of soil resources and root parasitism risk species parameters were more correlated to proxies for uptake of soil resources and root parasitism for crops than for weeds for the latter proxy variables were the result of a community of interacting species and parameters rather than of individual species or parameters therefore links between proxy variables and parameters were less obvious for weeds and could even seem counter intuitive for example weed communities most likely to be infected by p ramosa in autumn i e communities with the largest cumulated root length consisted mostly of species that did not invest much in roots and that explored the soil only at short distance instead they invested in strategically placed leaf area after emergence above neighbours to occupy space as fast as possible and shade their neighbours rather than be shaded as illustrated by their low shading response indeed occupying the field area as quickly as possible is crucial for a plant to survive and grow within a community colbach et al 2019 liebman and gallandt 1997 particularly if soil resources are assumed to be mostly non limiting as in the present case in terms of belowground exploration the fine scale seemed most important for parasitism of weeds because root length density was the key parameter as demonstrated by the specific root length parameter rather than root system volume depending on root system lateral extension this is consistent with literature reporting that large specific root length is a crucial trait for belowground exploration because it allows to explore greater soil volumes per unit of biomass invested in roots ma et al 2018 in contrast to weeds in terms of morphology and photosynthetic functioning the crops most likely to be infected in autumn were large both above and belowground and very plastic in response to shade all along their life cycle therefore it is likely that for crops which are deliberately sown and promoted by farming practices to the detriment of weeds exerting a strong competition once established is as at least as important as being able to establish quickly in summer key parameters for parasitism risk and potential soil resource uptake were different and more difficult to interpret for example for crops they were characteristics of winter cereals it is difficult to tell whether these characteristics did promote parasitism risk and potential uptake or whether this reflected the way we estimated missing parameters i e by averaging parameters by clade and seasonal type generally root parameters were less influent than aboveground parameters in our simulations this is not surprising considering that the florsys rscone function was one way here with rscone root variables driven by florsys state variables but the feedback from rscone to florsys i e root dependent functions are not modelled yet except for remobilization uptake of soil resources and p ramosa infection have a retroactive effect on plant growth respectively beneficial and detrimental barker et al 1996 lins et al 2007 weiner 2004 which could amplify the influence of root parameters to complete the two way connection between rscone and florsys we recently included these key root dependent functions i e plant plant competition for nitrogen moreau et al 2000 submitted and p ramosa infection pointurier et al n d submitted and their effects on plant growth and morphology into florsys however even after implementing such root functions in the model aboveground parameters could still be more influential than root parameters because soil resource uptake berger et al 2013 and the number of broomrapes supported by their hosts grenz et al 2008 are driven by the aboveground parts of plants it is noteworthy that our proxies quantify potential parasitism and soil resource uptake but disregard major aspects involved such as nitrogen uptake efficiency of plants aziz et al 2017 or host status qasem and foy 2007 which we are currently implementing in the model 4 3 agronomic implications as potential soil resource uptake was strongly correlated to the risk of parasitism in the simulations it will often be difficult to both improve crop nutrition and reduce p ramosa infection in situations where the latter is an issue however it is possible because the crops with the highest potential uptake were cereals which generally do not host p ramosa parker 2013 some species of cereals could even contribute to control p ramosa by depleting the parasite seed bank because they are false hosts e g oat avena sativa fernández aparicio et al 2009 i e they stimulate p ramosa germination but do not support its development goldwasser and rodenburg 2013 in the case of cover crops the correlation between increased soil resource uptake and increased p ramosa infection is actually an opportunity to reduce both nitrate leaching and p ramosa seed banks indeed the principle of p ramosa catch crops is to promote p ramosa infection on host crops to reduce the parasite seed bank and destroy the infected crops before p ramosa reproduction goldwasser and rodenburg 2013 our approach allows identifying ideotypes of crops i e theoretical ideal crop plants that combine all the characteristics required to reach one or several goals in a production situation martre et al 2015 here greater soil exploration abilities for example breeding less vigorous varieties which would be less likely to encounter p ramosa seeds would be a solution for host crops such as oilseed rape for which no parasite resistance has yet been found fernández aparicio et al 2016 however such varieties would be less competitive for soil resources against non parasitic weeds and their benefits would depend on whether parasitic or non parasitic weeds were the main limiting factor identifying ideotypes is also interesting for designing crop mixtures for example we showed that mixing winter cereals with dicotyledons which take up potentially fewer soil resources according to our simulations is relevant under limited water and nutrient supply another option is to mix species that explore complementary niches for example one taking up superficially and the other one more in depth postma and lynch 2012 our approach could be adapted to identify such mixtures the trade off between soil resource uptake and p ramosa control is interesting for weed management it means that strategies targeting resources hungry weed species e g deep banding fertilization that limits nutrient uptake by weeds to the advantage of crops blackshaw et al 2004 also control weeds that favour p ramosa infection the latter could though be achieved by different management strategies as we showed that interactions between different species with different parameters are very important within the weed community for example limiting broomrape infestation via weeds could be achieved either by directly controlling massively infected weed species as generally advised www terresinovia fr en savoir plus sur l orobanche rameuse or by tolerating non host weeds that compete with the latter colbach et al 2017a simulating a large number of cropping systems with our model could help to better understand the link between cropping techniques and proxies and to identify different efficient strategies including complex ones relying on interactions between weed species 5 conclusion by connecting a root model to a weed dynamics model we developed one of the rare plant dynamics model adapted to take into account competition for all resources light water and nutrients in multispecies heterogeneous stands we focused on weed dynamics in agroecosystems but our approach is sufficiently generic to be adapted to crop models aiming at designing crop mixtures for example we also propose a method to identify major plant characteristics involved in competition between crops and weeds for soil resources which could be adapted for designing crops mixtures we used proxies for competition for soil resources and for parasitism of crops and weeds and the results will help to implement the actual processes in florsys this will ultimately make florsys a powerful tool for designing agroecological cropping systems it will allow testing complex strategies that modulate competitive relationships between crops weeds and broomrape via e g sowing dates and patterns or fertilization credit authorship contribution statement olivia
