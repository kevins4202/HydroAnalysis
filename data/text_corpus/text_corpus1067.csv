5335,soil moisture sm plays an important role in regional runoff variations energy dynamics and vegetation productivity it is also widely used to detecting agricultural drought recently a severe drought occurred in yunnan province in southwestern china so long term changes in surface sm were of concern however there were only 18 sm stations in yunnan province and the longest observation was less than five years thus long term changes in climate change initiative cci sm were investigated cci sm and in situ sm had similar trends of temporal variations and a systematic difference the revised cci sm was built by a linear regression model based on the relationship between in situ sm at each station and the corresponding grid of cci sm the revised cci sm showed an abnormally low value during the severe drought in 2009 indicating that the monthly revised cci sm could detect drought in yunnan province sm drought easily occurred during the dry seasons and the frequency of drought seems to decrease but the severity of drought increased in the 21st century the seasonal sm struggled to reflect drought correctly and accurately cci sm needs validation before use due to its variable quality in summary cci sm provides a better tool than in situ sm to investigate long term changes in sm and detect drought and can be used for climate modeling keywords soil moisture revised cci sm spatial pattern long term yunnan province 1 introduction soil moisture sm is an essential property of soil and a primary product of precipitation irrigation groundwater recharge and vapor condensation in the air seneviratne et al 2010 spatiotemporal distributions and variations in sm have significant impacts on regional runoff variations energy dynamics and vegetation productivity monitoring spatial patterns of sm in a vast region can provide information on the severity of agriculture drought in a range of fields including hydrology ecology and agriculture alderfasi and nielsen 2001 ben asher et al 1992 vereecken et al 2008 sm can be measured by ground in situ observations or remote sensing although ground observations are accurate and rapid the spatial patterns of sm cannot be reflected appropriately over a larger area due to the influences of local factors e g aspect slope and land use surface sm can also be obtained through the retrieval of active and passive satellite microwave sensors e g scanning multichannel microwave radiometer smmr paloscia et al 2001 advanced scatterometer ascat bartalis et al 2007 and advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e njoku et al 2003 due to the growing demand for sm observations dedicated missions to measure sm e g soil moisture ocean salinity smos mecklenburg et al 2012 and soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 were successfully launched in november 2009 and january 2015 respectively sm products retrieved from a single sensor have advantages but also limitations because of their unstable qualities and limited coverage over time and space e g smmr covered from november 1978 to august 1987 and amsr e covered from july 2002 to 2010 thus none of them can provide long term and continuous records of surface sm several fusion algorithms e g the land parameter retrieval method lprm owe et al 2008 and the tu wien change detection method bartalis et al 2007 wagner et al 1999 were used to generate a multisensor sm product within the framework of the european space agency s climate change initiative esa cci cci sm products have attracted much research on verification and application its accuracy has been widely verified on regional or global scales by comparison with ground based measurements dorigo et al 2015 ikonen et al 2018 an et al 2016 su et al 2016 wang et al 2016 peng et al 2015 evaluated the satellite based sm products of amsr e ascat smos and cci sm through in situ sm from 2008 to 2012 in yunnan province of southwest china suggesting that cci sm could better represent the temporal dynamics of sm in yunnan province owing to its higher correlation coefficient of 0 72 and lower unbiased root mean square difference of 0 046 m3 m3 regarding applications in addition to ecology sakai et al 2016 szczypta et al 2014 hydrology allam et al 2016 climate change bauer marschallinger et al 2013 miralles et al 2014 cci sm was widely used in drought especially agricultural drought because it affects vegetation growth more directly than precipitation carrão et al 2016 liu et al 2015 cci sm provides an opportunity to study drought in yunnan province which is located in southwest china this region is humid but has suffered severe drought disaster in recent years qiang et al 2010 qiu 2010 zhang et al 2012 these droughts profoundly impaired the local environments and societies for example yunnan province experienced a sustained and severe drought from autumn 2009 to spring 2010 long et al 2014 xu et al 2015 which caused about 9 7 million people withou clean drinking water and 2 5 billion in agricultural losses qiu 2010 yunnan yearbook editorial committee 2010 therefore understanding changes in the severity and frequency of droughts over the past few decades is essential for locals which can be investigated through long term sm however there were only 18 sm measurement stations in yunnan province and the longest observation data was less than five years it is imperative to use multisource data to analyze long term changes in sm and cci sm is a good candidate peng et al 2015 this study has investigated long term changes in sm in yunnan province and the potential of the cci sm combined product to detect drought the specific aims of this study include the following 1 estimate and revise cci sm by comparing it with in situ sm measurements from 2008 to 2012 2 investigate long term changes in surface sm on monthly and seasonal scales by revised cci sm from 1978 to 2016 and 3 discuss the ability and limits of cci sm to detect drought 2 data and methods 2 1 study area yunnan province is located at 21 8 29 15 n 97 31 106 11 e and covers an area of approximately 394 000 km2 fig 1 the topography is characterized by high mountains and deep valleys in the western part and karst geomorphology in the eastern part and the elevation gradually decreases from the northwest to the southeast with an average altitude of 1 980 m a s l above sea level fan et al 2011 the climate is characterized as dry and cold in winter and humid and hot in summer which is typical of the subtropical plateau monsoon climate li et al 2015 zhang 1988 zhang et al 2012 specifically the northwestern part is a frigid zone with a long winter and a short spring and autumn the eastern and central parts belong to a temperate climate with warm temperatures the southern and western parts have a tropical climate with a long summer but no winter the distribution of precipitation varies greatly the monsoon season may to october and dry season november to april contribute 85 and 15 of the total precipitation respectively xie and zhang 2000 2 2 data 2 2 1 cci sm cci sm is a multisource product of surface sm generated by the esa cci the version 4 2 of cci sm covers 38 years from november 1978 to december 2016 it contains three different products the active product the passive product and the combined product which merges the former two products gruber et al 2017 liu et al 2012 2011 wagner et al 2012 the active microwave product is derived from ami ws and ascat while the passive product is derived from amsr e amsr 2 smmr smos ssm i tmi and windsat we used the combined product of cci sm from november 1978 to december 2016 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 a temporal resolution of 1 day and a volumetric unit m3 m3 the provincial cci sm is the simple arithmetic average of all the cci sm grids in the province 2 2 2 in situ observation data in situ observation data from a total of 18 sm stations in yunnan province fig 1b from 2008 to 2012 were collected and the necessary information for these stations is listed in table 1 in situ sm is measured by frequency domain reflectometry fdr sensors guo et al 2003 at the top 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm below the surface fdr uses the principle of an electromagnetic pulse to measure the dielectric constant of soil based on the propagation frequency of electromagnetic waves in the medium and then obtains the volumetric water content of the soil the observation data were provided by the yunnan hydrology and water resources bureau with a unit of m3 m3 and a temporal resolution of 1 day there were total 13 050 available daily samples 10 998 lost samples particularly 8 838 invalid samples were eliminated because these unchanged for more than 20 days at a station which was regarded as an anomaly caused by instrument failure the land use information came from the product downloaded from the resource and environment data cloud platform http www resdc cn default aspx it was obtained through visual interpretation of 2010 landsat tm etm images and includes 6 major land use types cropland grassland forest water body urban and built up land and unused land there is no consensus on the precise penetration depth of cci sm dorigo et al 2017 considering products combined in cci sm were based on the l band e g smos smap with penetration depth of 5 cm or the c band e g amsr e amsr2 windsat ers ascat and x band e g tmi amsr e amsr 2 with penetration depth of about 1 2 cm owe and griend 1998 ulaby et al 1982 cci sm was considered to represent only a few centimeters of the surface yuan et al 2015 therefore in situ sm measured at 10 cm was selected to verify cci sm as it was closest to the soil layer accessible by satellite observation monthly precipitation records from 36 national rain gauge stations in yunnan province fig 1b from 1978 to 2016 were obtained from the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration cma the provincial precipitation is the simple arithmetic average of all the stations in the province 2 3 methods 2 3 1 evaluation indices the performance of cci sm is quantitatively evaluated by calculating four evaluation indices in comparison with in situ sm these indices include the pearson correlation coefficient r the relative bias bias the mean absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse for which the equations are as follows 1 r t 1 n sm t in sm in sm t cci sm cci t 1 n sm t in sm in t 1 n sm t cci sm cci 2 bias t 1 n sm t cci sm t in t 1 n sm t in 100 3 mae 1 n t 1 n sm t in sm t cci 100 4 rmse t 1 n sm t in sm t cci 2 n where n represents the number of samples of cci sm and in situ sm sm t in is in situ sm sm t cci is cci sm and sm in and sm cci are the averages over n of sm t in and sm t cci respectively the coefficient r represents the linear agreement between cci sm and in situ sm which ranges from 1 to 1 with positive values designating positive correlation and vice versa bias reveals the range of the deviation of cci sm from in situ sm the closer the bias is to 0 the more accurate the cci sm is mae is the average absolute difference between cci sm and in situ sm and rmse represents the sample standard deviation of the difference between them 2 3 2 revision method to make full use of the information and characteristics of in situ sm the revision strategy applies the revision formula of each station to all points closest to it the thiessen polygon meets this requirement because the distance from any location in the polygon to the station in this polygon is less than the distance to the stations in the other polygons and this method is often used to calculate the regional average precipitation li et al 2006 thus the thiessen polygon is utilized to build subregions where all the grids are revised according to the relationship between in situ sm and cci sm at the station more specifically the revision method follows three steps fig 2 first the whole region of yunnan province was divided into 18 subregions that is 18 thiessen polygons according to the locations of the 18 sm observation stations fig 1 second based on the scatter plots of daily in situ sm at each station and cci sm of the corresponding grid from 2008 to 2012 the revision formula of the station was established by the linear regression model brocca et al 2011 finally all the cci sm grids in the subregion were calculated according to the revision formula of the station in that subregion and then the other subregions were calculated in the same way to obtain the revised cci sm the monthly and seasonal revised cci sm were averages of the daily revised cci sm 2 3 3 anomaly anomaly is the deviation between a value and the long term norm for a series of values which is categorized into positive anomaly and negative anomaly because it can effectively avoid the effect of seasonal variations it is widely used in meteorological droughts such as the percentage of precipitation anomalies pa the soil moisture anomaly sma is defined as the percentage of the difference between the current sm and the average sm in corresponding periods over the years the average sm is considered to be the climatological appropriate value for the local sm during this period when the current sm is lower than the multiyear average sm the sm is deficient thereby determining the occurrence of droughts sma and pa have been widely used in drought monitoring luo et al 2012 mao et al 2017 wu et al 2012 yu 1995 pa and sma can be calculated as follows 5 anomaly x t x t x t where x is an absolute value of sm or precipitation in a month or a season x t is the average of all the same months or season values and t is sm or precipitation 2 3 4 detection of drought according to the chinese drought standard national climate center 2017 a meteorological drought is divided into five grades by pa the classification rules are listed in table 2 because there is no recognized standard for drought classification based on sm sma data were normalized by min max normalization formula 6 so that the data had a consistent data range with the pa in the same period and the sm based drought classification could be performed using the classification rules of pa 6 a sm i a sm m i n a sm m a x a sm m i n a p i a p m i n a p m a x a p m i n where a sm m i n and a sm m a x are the minimum and maximum values of the sma and a p m a x and a p m i n are the minimum and maximum values of the pa respectively 3 results 3 1 validation of the original cci sm against in situ sm the statistical comparisons of 13 050 samples between daily in situ sm and cci sm of the corresponding grid from 2008 to 2012 were investigated the average of r was 0 59 and all stations were significant at the 99 confidence level which suggests a moderately high agreement between cci sm and in situ sm on a daily scale rmse ranged from 0 05 to 0 26 m3 m3 with an average of 0 14 m3 m3 the bias ranged from 3 18 to 361 7 with an average of 90 94 indicating a systematic difference between cci sm and in situ sm mae varied from 0 04 to 0 25 m3 m3 with an average of 0 12 m3 m3 implying that the average difference between cci sm and in situ sm was 0 12 m3 m3 this systematic difference was mainly caused by their inconsistent spatial scales different depths of measurement vegetation cover and terrain further details in the discussion section 4 3 in addition the apparent differences between each evaluation index at each station further exhibited that sm has strong spatial heterogeneity to accurately investigate long term changes in sm it is better to revise cci sm to match in situ sm by considering the characteristics at each station 3 2 revision of cci sm cci sm was revised based on the 13 050 samples using the revision method described in 2 3 2 the scatter plots and revised formulas are shown in fig 3 the averages of bias mae and rmse between the revised cci sm and in situ sm were 0 54 0 03 m3 m3 and 0 03 m3 m3 respectively which significantly reduced compared to the values of the original cci sm sample size slope and intercept of scatter plots varied greatly implying that the method based on each station performed better than the method based on provincial average 3 3 comparison of original cci sm revised cci sm and in situ sm the time series of the monthly original cci sm in situ sm and revised cci sm in yunnan province from 2008 to 2012 fig 4 a suggested that they were all characterized by an obvious seasonal cycle they were maximum around august in summer and minimum around february in winter and changed consistently with precipitation in addition it is apparent that original cci sm fluctuated in the range of about 0 15 to 0 35 while the in situ sm and the revised cci sm wavered in the range of about 0 1 to 0 2 indicating that the revision method eliminate most systematic difference the time series of the anomalies of in situ sm cci sm and revised cci sm fig 4b illustrated their consistent change trends as well as abnormally low values from winter 2009 to spring 2010 corresponding with the duration of the severe drought disaster although the revised cci sm fluctuated weaker than in situ sm and original cci sm it could detect drought event in yunnan province as its values were significantly lower during the drought period than other periods 3 4 long term changes in revised cci sm 3 4 1 long term changes on a monthly scale cci sm combined product s quality was unsatisfied in some periods e g there were too few valid grids in the daily image to cover the whole province with data or there were only a few days with valid data each month and the average condition of the month could not be represented these defective data covered from august 1987 to july 1991 february 2001 to may 2001 and march 2003 to december 2005 and has been excluded in this study the details of the quality control are described in the discussion section 4 1 we employed the revised cci sm from three periods including the first period from november 1978 to july 1987 with a total of 105 months the second period from august 1991 to february 2003 except january march 1992 and february may 2001 with a total of 132 months and the third period from january 2006 to december 2016 with a total of 132 months it should be noted that every month in the first period only had nine days with images which included 210 valid grids its medium representativeness resulted in an acceptable performance so the changes in sm during this period were still explored the time series of the monthly revised cci sm and precipitation in yunnan province fig 5 a c and e suggested that both had significant seasonal cycles with higher values in summer and lower values in winter the seasonal cycle of revised cci sm lagged precipitation by approximately one month which is consistent with the results reported by wang et al 2016 the revised cci sm had a significant p 0 01 correlation with precipitation with r values of 0 49 0 86 and 0 86 in the three periods respectively indicating that surface sm had a high agreement with precipitation in the second and third periods but a moderate agreement in the first period due to its limited quality the time series of the smoothed revised cci sma and pa using the moving average method makridakis and wheelwright 1983 fig 5b d and f suggested that these metrics have similar variation patterns in general both fluctuated slightly without obvious trends during the first and second periods then they sharply decreased from 2009 to 2010 and gradually increased from 2011 to 2015 indicating that sm had recovered after suffering severe drought from 2009 to 2010 which was consistent with the total water storage from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace ma et al 2017 droughts reflected by the monthly revised cci sm occurred eighteen times in three periods table 3 including one extreme drought in december 2009 that lasted three months four serious droughts in february 1986 june 1986 may 1987 may 1997 two moderate droughts in november 1984 and march 1987 and eleven slight droughts fig 5 in the first period there were ten droughts including five slight droughts two moderate droughts and three serious droughts the drought in the spring of 1987 was the most severe in this period which included a moderate drought in march and a serious drought in may six droughts occurred in the second period including five slight droughts and one serious drought in may 1997 this serious drought was reported by the yunnan disaster reduction yearbook editorial committee 1999 which led to 10 400 km2 of crop damage and left 5 14 million people and 6 43 million livestock without drinking water in the third period there were two droughts including one slight drought and one extreme drought from december 2009 to february 2010 which lasted three months during this extreme drought the precipitation was 48 less than the average of the same period and broke the minimum historical record and the maximum temperature was 2 4 c higher than the maximum historical record which caused severe damage to the socioeconomic development and ecology of yunnan province yunnan disaster reduction yearbook editorial committee 2012 of the eighteen times of sm droughts thirteen times occurred in dry seasons and five times occurred in monsoon seasons among of which four times were in the first period the drought was more likely to occur during the dry season which mainly because the absolute values of precipitation and sm in the dry season were less and their slight changes could induce severe and extreme droughts therefore the impact of droughts in dry season have less impact than that during the monsoon season overall many droughts occurred before the extreme drought in 2009 and mainly distributed in dry seasons it seemed that frequency of drought decreased but the severity of drought increased in the 21st century 3 4 2 long term changes on a seasonal scale long term changes in the provincial averages of the revised cci sm and precipitation in spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february were investigated fig 6 the r values between the revised cci sm and precipitation in spring summer autumn and winter in the first period were 0 73 p 0 05 0 11 0 50 and 0 98 p 0 01 in the second period they were 0 93 p 0 01 0 75 p 0 01 0 80 p 0 01 0 67 p 0 05 and in the third period the r values were 0 14 0 76 p 0 0 1 0 80 p 0 01 0 89 p 0 01 respectively there was a good correlation between the revised cci sm and precipitation on a seasonal scale in both the second and third periods except spring in the third period in the first period the similar values of four seasons and slight correlation coefficient probably was the result of worse data quality further details in the discussion section 4 1 the trends of most seasons in the three periods were not significant indicating that the seasonal revised cci sm had no evident and reliable trends for long term changes in surface sm some differences between sm and precipitation were found in terms of the revised cci sm in the second and third periods the values in winter and spring were closer and lower than the values in autumn and summer however for precipitation the values in spring and autumn were very close and the values in winter were the lowest fig 6b which proves the response time of sm to precipitation spring generally lacks precipitation but water demand of crops increases leading to a continuous deficit and reduction in sm therefore sm is more sensitive to agricultural drought and more conducive to detecting agricultural drought a total of twenty one droughts were reflected by the seasonal revised cci sm including twenty slight droughts and one moderate drought the droughts mainly occurred in autumn eight times and winter seven times a severe drought was detected in 2009 and 2010 indicating that the seasonal revised cci sm has the ability to reflect severe drought however of these twenty one droughts there were only eight droughts including months with drought while the remaining thirteen droughts did not include months with drought in addition the droughts reflected by the seasonal data only contain two grades of slight drought and moderate drought the limitation of seasonal sm to detect drought may be because the process of calculating average of sm from three months to one seasonal offset the features of abnormally low values in drought months overall seasonal revised sm struggles to detect drought correctly and accurately so it may be better to monitor and analyze droughts using the cci sm series on monthly or fine scales 4 discussion 4 1 data quality of cci sm the monthly cci sm combined product fluctuated abnormally and had no obvious seasonal variation in yunnan province in some periods fig 7 a in order to explore the causation of this abnormal phenomenon the number of valid grids in daily cci sm images and the number of days with valid data each month from november 1978 to december 2016 were counted fig 7b according to the quality of cci sm we divided the entire study period into five segments including two segments with poor quality segment 2 august 1987 to july 1991 and segment 4 march 2003 to december 2005 one period with medium quality segment 1 november 1978 to july 1987 and two periods with good quality segment 3 august 1991 to february 2003 and segment 5 january 2006 to december 2016 for the two periods with poor quality there were only 2 grids in daily cci sm and only 12 days with valid data each month in segment 2 14 grids per day and 19 days per month in segment 4 the data in segment 2 and segment 4 could not represent the provincial sm conditions because it could not cover the entire province the average numbers of grids and days were 210 and 9 in segment 1 respectively indicating that the data in segment 1 had limited representativeness in segment 3 there were 160 grids each day and 24 days with valid data each month and 299 grids each day and 30 days with valid data each month in segment 5 indicating that these data could cover the entire province and were available almost daily three reasons are possible for the poor quality of cci sm in some periods first just a small number of active and passive microwave products participated in blending at the early stage e g only smmr or ssm i was used in segment 1 fig 7 at this stage there were no data in many gaps between adjacent scanning strips second some data were discarded in the process of blending because they did not reach the convergence criteria due to their significant deviation liu et al 2012 the third possible reason is that the failure and pause of the sensors led to a reduction in data coverage dorigo et al 2015 loew et al 2013 overall cci sm product needs validation before use chen 2015 dorigo et al 2017 the data quality has shown significant improvement due to the growing number of satellites improvements in the instrumentation design and sensor performance and the development of rigorous blending scheme gruber et al 2017 indicating that cci sm has great potential to obtain better performance for monitoring surface sm in the future 4 2 comparison of droughts reflected by precipitation and sm on the monthly scale sm droughts and meteorological droughts rarely occurred in summer and usually occurred in winter which was dominated by the natural law of uneven precipitation distribution it is different that meteorological droughts were more than sm droughts in autumn because sm could decrease slowly due to its water storage capacity inversely sm drought might be more likely to happen than meteorological drought in spring because increasing water requirement of crop lead to continuous deficit and reduction of sm in terms of quantity the meteorological drought was more than sm drought because meteorological droughts for a single month generally could not cause significant scarcity of sm 4 3 uncertainty 4 3 1 uncertainty of in situ sm there is extensive horizontal variability in surface sm which are caused by complex interactions between factors of soil terrain vegetation and meteorology crow et al 2012 these uncertainties are difficult to separate and quantify variations in soil such as texture organic matter content porosity and structure can influence the spatial patterns of sm for instance panciera 2009 showed that soils with higher sand content exhibited consistently drier sm conditions than soils with lower sand content terrain also plays an important role specifically its increase in heterogeneity lead to an increased in sm changes charpentier and groffman 1992 because alterations in slope aspect curvature and relative elevation all have impact on the dynamic of surface sm the type of land use directly affects hydrological process which controls the level of sm and it brings more dynamic influence on sm compared to soil and terrain factors meteorological factors such as solar radiation wind and humidity can all alter level and distribution of sm but precipitation is the most important meteorological forcing factor as it is one of the primary sources of soil water 18 in situ sm stations were affected different environment so the slope and interception of liner relationship between in situ sm and cci sm at each station differed greatly fig 3 for this reason it is very appropriate and necessary to make the utmost of the information at each station in the revision process 4 3 2 uncertainty of cci sm uncertainties of cci sm mainly come from sensors orbitals environments algorithms and post processing dorigo et al 2017 the products involved in generating the cci sm were based on different sensors which penetrated different depths of soil and their individual errors eventually propagated to the combined product in addition the three products of cci sm have different performances the active product has better agreement in areas covered by moderate vegetation while the passive product has better performance in bare and sparsely vegetated areas liu et al 2012 the combined product used in this paper has high spatial temporal coverage but simultaneously sacrifice the accuracy of the data yuan et al 2015 4 3 3 uncertainty of revision there are four aspects of uncertainty in revision method the first aspect is the differences in depths accessible by in situ measurement and satellite observation cci sm is considered to represent sm condition at few centimeters below the surface while in situ sm was measured at depth of 10 cm but comprising these two kinds of sm is still feasible because there was a good correlation between near surface layer 0 2 5 cm and deeper sm 2 5 30 5 cm rezaul and kenneth 2007 and numerous studies have adopted the validation of cci sm against in situ sm at 10 cm an et al 2016 dorigo et al 2015 peng et al 2015 uncertainty also derived from the discrepancy in spatial scales between in situ sm and cci sm in situ sm measured at a specific point can only represent a limited range due to high spatial heterogeneity of sm while each grid of the cci sm image can signify the average sm over an approximately 28 28 km2 this huge difference in area means a difference in land use types of the 18 stations only 7 stations had the same land use type as the main land use type corresponding to the cci sm grids 11 stations had land use types of cropland among which the main type of just 4 corresponding cci sm grids was cropland which mainly because the focus of in situ sm observation was on agriculture the sum of proportion of cropland grassland and forest was greater than 90 in all grids which indicates that the uncertainty is less impacted by bare soil table 4 however it still brought some uncertainties for instance panciera 2009 reported that in terms of sm at satellite footprint sm in crop areas was higher than average and sm in forest areas was lower than average while grassland could best represent average sm conditions how to reduce the uncertainties of different land use types remains a difficult task in the next work we will try to improve revision method based on the proportion of land use types in each cci sm grid thirdly relationship between in situ sm and the corresponding cci sm grid was used to revise for all the grids within a thiessen polygon due to the spatial heterogeneity of sm the actual influence of the revision formula was supposed to gradually decrease from station to boundary however it remained the same in current method resulting in significant deviations at the boundary where sm should normally be continuous and smooth the last aspect of uncertainty came from the discrepancy in sm during dry and monsoon seasons the current revision method could eliminate the systematic difference between cci sm and in situ sm however the revision method probably to be improved after comprehensive experiments such as revising the cci sm based on the separation of the dry and monsoon seasons we will improve it in the further work 5 conclusions long term changes in surface sm in yunnan province were investigated using cci sm and in situ sm the following conclusions were made 1 cci sm and in situ sm in yunnan province had similar trends of temporal variations and a systematic difference the revised cci sm had no overall deviation from in situ sm and had an abnormally low value during the severe drought from 2009 to 2010 indicating that the revised cci sm can be used to detect droughts 2 droughts detected by monthly revised cci sm mainly occurred during dry season additionally the frequency of droughts seemed to decrease but the severity of droughts increased in the 21st century the seasonal sm only detected slight and moderate droughts so it is challenging to monitor droughts correctly and accurately 3 the quality of cci sm data was not stable at an early stage because of few grids in the daily images or few days with valid data each month thus it needs to be quality controlled before use cci sm provides a better tool to analyze long term changes in sm and detected drought more comprehensive than only using in situ observations credit authorship

5335,soil moisture sm plays an important role in regional runoff variations energy dynamics and vegetation productivity it is also widely used to detecting agricultural drought recently a severe drought occurred in yunnan province in southwestern china so long term changes in surface sm were of concern however there were only 18 sm stations in yunnan province and the longest observation was less than five years thus long term changes in climate change initiative cci sm were investigated cci sm and in situ sm had similar trends of temporal variations and a systematic difference the revised cci sm was built by a linear regression model based on the relationship between in situ sm at each station and the corresponding grid of cci sm the revised cci sm showed an abnormally low value during the severe drought in 2009 indicating that the monthly revised cci sm could detect drought in yunnan province sm drought easily occurred during the dry seasons and the frequency of drought seems to decrease but the severity of drought increased in the 21st century the seasonal sm struggled to reflect drought correctly and accurately cci sm needs validation before use due to its variable quality in summary cci sm provides a better tool than in situ sm to investigate long term changes in sm and detect drought and can be used for climate modeling keywords soil moisture revised cci sm spatial pattern long term yunnan province 1 introduction soil moisture sm is an essential property of soil and a primary product of precipitation irrigation groundwater recharge and vapor condensation in the air seneviratne et al 2010 spatiotemporal distributions and variations in sm have significant impacts on regional runoff variations energy dynamics and vegetation productivity monitoring spatial patterns of sm in a vast region can provide information on the severity of agriculture drought in a range of fields including hydrology ecology and agriculture alderfasi and nielsen 2001 ben asher et al 1992 vereecken et al 2008 sm can be measured by ground in situ observations or remote sensing although ground observations are accurate and rapid the spatial patterns of sm cannot be reflected appropriately over a larger area due to the influences of local factors e g aspect slope and land use surface sm can also be obtained through the retrieval of active and passive satellite

their unstable qualities and limited coverage over time and space e g smmr covered from november 1978 to august 1987 and amsr e covered from july 2002 to 2010 thus none of them can provide long term

were used to generate a multisensor sm product within the framework of the european space agency s climate change initiative esa cci cci sm products have attracted much research on verification and application its accuracy has been widely verified on regional or global scales by comparison with ground based measurements dorigo et al 2015 ikonen et al 2018 an et al 2016 su et al 2016 wang et al 2016 peng et al 2015 evaluated the satellite based sm products of amsr e ascat smos and cci sm through in situ sm from 2008 to 2012 in yunnan province of southwest china suggesting that cci sm could better represent the temporal dynamics of sm in yunnan province owing to its higher correlation coefficient of 0 72 and lower unbiased root mean square difference of 0 046 m3 m3 regarding applications in addition to ecology sakai et al 2016 szczypta et al 2014 hydrology allam et al 2016 climate change bauer marschallinger et al 2013 miralles et al 2014 cci sm was widely used in drought especially agricultural drought because it affects vegetation growth more directly than precipitation carrão et al 2016 liu et al 2015 cci sm provides an opportunity to study drought in yunnan province which is located in southwest china this region is humid but has suffered severe drought disaster in recent years qiang et al 2010 qiu 2010 zhang et al 2012 these droughts profoundly impaired the local environments and societies for example yunnan province experienced a sustained and severe drought from autumn 2009 to spring 2010 long et al 2014 xu et al 2015 which caused about 9 7 million people withou clean drinking water and 2 5 billion in agricultural losses qiu 2010 yunnan yearbook editorial committee 2010 therefore understanding changes in the severity and frequency of droughts over the past few decades is essential for locals which can be investigated through long term sm however there were only 18 sm measurement stations in yunnan province and the longest observation data was less than five years it is imperative to use multisource data to analyze long term changes in sm and cci sm is a good candidate peng et al 2015 this study has investigated long term changes in sm in yunnan province and the potential of the cci sm combined product to detect drought the specific aims of this study include the following 1 estimate and revise cci sm by comparing it with in situ sm measurements from 2008 to 2012 2 investigate long term changes in surface sm on monthly and seasonal scales by revised cci sm from 1978 to 2016 and 3 discuss the ability and limits of cci sm to detect drought 2 data and methods 2 1 study area yunnan province is located at 21 8 29 15 n 97 31 106 11 e and covers an area of approximately 394 000 km2 fig 1 the topography is characterized by high mountains and deep valleys in the western part and karst geomorphology in the eastern part and the elevation gradually decreases from the northwest to the southeast with an average altitude of 1 980 m a s l above sea level fan et al 2011 the climate is characterized as dry and cold in winter and humid and hot in summer which is typical of the subtropical plateau monsoon climate li et al 2015 zhang 1988 zhang et al 2012 specifically the northwestern part is a frigid zone with a long winter and a short spring and autumn the eastern and central parts belong to a temperate climate with warm temperatures the southern and western parts have a tropical climate with a long summer but no winter the distribution of precipitation varies greatly the monsoon season may to october and dry season november to april contribute 85 and 15 of the total precipitation respectively xie and zhang 2000 2 2 data 2 2 1 cci sm cci sm is a multisource product of surface sm generated by the esa cci the version 4 2 of cci sm covers 38 years from november 1978 to december 2016 it contains three different products the active product the passive product and the combined product which merges the former two products gruber et al 2017 liu et al 2012 2011 wagner et al 2012 the active microwave product is derived from ami ws and ascat while the passive product is derived from amsr e amsr 2 smmr smos ssm i tmi and windsat we used the combined product of cci sm from november 1978 to december 2016 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 a temporal resolution of 1 day and a volumetric unit m3 m3 the provincial cci sm is the simple arithmetic average of all the cci sm grids in the province 2 2 2 in situ observation data in situ observation data from a total of 18 sm stations in yunnan province fig 1b from 2008 to 2012 were collected and the necessary information for these stations is listed in table 1 in situ sm is measured by frequency domain reflectometry fdr sensors guo et al 2003 at the top 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm below the surface fdr uses the principle of an electromagnetic pulse to measure the dielectric constant of soil based on the propagation frequency of electromagnetic waves in the medium and then obtains the volumetric water content of the soil the observation data were provided by the yunnan hydrology and water resources bureau with a unit of m3 m3 and a temporal resolution of 1 day there were total 13 050 available daily samples 10 998 lost samples particularly 8 838 invalid samples were eliminated because these unchanged for more than 20 days at a station which was regarded as an anomaly caused by instrument failure the land use information came from the product downloaded from the resource and environment data cloud platform http www resdc cn default aspx it was obtained through visual interpretation of 2010 landsat tm etm images and includes 6 major land use types cropland grassland forest water body urban and built up land and unused land there is no consensus on the precise penetration depth of cci sm dorigo et al 2017 considering products combined in cci sm were based on the l band e g smos smap with penetration depth of 5 cm or the c band e g amsr e amsr2 windsat ers ascat and x band e g tmi amsr e amsr 2 with penetration depth of about 1 2 cm owe and griend 1998 ulaby et al 1982 cci sm was considered to represent only a few centimeters of the surface yuan et al 2015 therefore in situ sm measured at 10 cm was selected to verify cci sm as it was closest to the soil layer accessible by satellite observation monthly precipitation records from 36 national rain gauge stations in yunnan province fig 1b from 1978 to 2016 were obtained from the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration cma the provincial precipitation is the simple arithmetic average of all the stations in the province 2 3 methods 2 3 1 evaluation indices the performance of cci sm is quantitatively evaluated by calculating four evaluation indices in comparison with in situ sm these indices include the pearson correlation coefficient r the relative bias bias the mean absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse for which the equations are as follows 1 r t 1 n sm t in sm in sm t cci sm cci t 1 n sm t in sm in t 1 n sm t cci sm cci 2 bias t 1 n sm t cci sm t in t 1 n sm t in 100 3 mae 1 n t 1 n sm t in sm t cci 100 4 rmse t 1 n sm t in sm t cci 2 n where n represents the number of samples of cci sm and in situ sm sm t in is in situ sm sm t cci is cci sm and sm in and sm cci are the averages over n of sm t in and sm t cci respectively the coefficient r represents the linear agreement between cci sm and in situ sm which ranges from 1 to 1 with positive values designating positive correlation and vice versa bias reveals the range of the deviation of cci sm from in situ sm the closer the bias is to 0 the more accurate the cci sm is mae is the average absolute difference between cci sm and in situ sm and rmse represents the sample standard deviation of the difference between them 2 3 2 revision method to make full use of the information and characteristics of in situ sm the revision strategy applies the revision formula of each station to all points closest to it the thiessen polygon meets this requirement because the distance from any location in the polygon to the station in this polygon is less than the distance to the stations in the other polygons and this method is often used to calculate the regional average precipitation li et al 2006 thus the thiessen polygon is utilized to build subregions where all the grids are revised according to the relationship between in situ sm and cci sm at the station more specifically the revision method follows three steps fig 2 first the whole region of yunnan province was divided into 18 subregions that is 18 thiessen polygons according to the locations of the 18 sm observation stations fig 1 second based on the scatter plots of daily in situ sm at each station and cci sm of the corresponding grid from 2008 to 2012 the revision formula of the station was established by the linear regression model brocca et al 2011 finally all the cci sm grids in the subregion were calculated according to the revision formula of the station in that subregion and then the other subregions were calculated in the same way to obtain the revised cci sm the monthly and seasonal revised cci sm were averages of the daily revised cci sm 2 3 3 anomaly anomaly is the deviation between a value and the long term norm for a series of values which is categorized into positive anomaly and negative anomaly because it can effectively avoid the effect of seasonal variations it is widely used in meteorological droughts such as the percentage of precipitation anomalies pa the soil moisture anomaly sma is defined as the percentage of the difference between the current sm and the average sm in corresponding periods over the years the average sm is considered to be the climatological appropriate value for the local sm during this period when the current sm is lower than the multiyear average sm the sm is deficient thereby determining the occurrence of droughts sma and pa have been widely used in drought monitoring luo et al 2012 mao et al 2017 wu et al 2012 yu 1995 pa and sma can be calculated as follows 5 anomaly x t x t x t where x is an absolute value of sm or precipitation in a month or a season x t is the average of all the same months or season values and t is sm or precipitation 2 3 4 detection of drought according to the chinese drought standard national climate center 2017 a meteorological drought is divided into five grades by pa the classification rules are listed in table 2 because there is no recognized standard for drought classification based on sm sma data were normalized by min max normalization formula 6 so that the data had a consistent data range with the pa in the same period and the sm based drought classification could be performed using the classification rules of pa 6 a sm i a sm m i n a sm m a x a sm m i n a p i a p m i n a p m a x a p m i n where a sm m i n and a sm m a x are the minimum and maximum values of the sma and a p m a x and a p m i n are the minimum and maximum values of the pa respectively 3 results 3 1 validation of the original cci sm against in situ sm the statistical comparisons of 13 050 samples between daily in situ sm and cci sm of the corresponding grid from 2008 to 2012 were investigated the average of r was 0 59 and all stations were significant at the 99 confidence level which suggests a moderately high agreement between cci sm and in situ sm on a daily scale rmse ranged from 0 05 to 0 26 m3 m3 with an average of 0 14 m3 m3 the bias ranged from 3 18 to 361 7 with an average of 90 94 indicating a systematic difference between cci sm and in situ sm mae varied from 0 04 to 0 25 m3 m3 with an average of 0 12 m3 m3 implying that the average difference between cci sm and in situ sm was 0 12 m3 m3 this systematic difference was mainly caused by their inconsistent spatial scales different depths of measurement vegetation cover and terrain further details in the discussion section 4 3 in addition the apparent differences between each evaluation index at each station further exhibited that sm has strong spatial heterogeneity to accurately investigate long term changes in sm it is better to revise cci sm to match in situ sm by considering the characteristics at each station 3 2 revision of cci sm cci sm was revised based on the 13 050 samples using the revision method described in 2 3 2 the scatter plots and revised formulas are shown in fig 3 the averages of bias mae and rmse between the revised cci sm and in situ sm were 0 54 0 03 m3 m3 and 0 03 m3 m3 respectively which significantly reduced compared to the values of the original cci sm sample size slope and intercept of scatter plots varied greatly implying that the method based on each station performed better than the method based on provincial average 3 3 comparison of original cci sm revised cci sm and in situ sm the time series of the monthly original cci sm in situ sm and revised cci sm in yunnan province from 2008 to 2012 fig 4 a suggested that they were all characterized by an obvious seasonal cycle they were maximum around august in summer and minimum around february in winter and changed consistently with precipitation in addition it is apparent that original cci sm fluctuated in the range of about 0 15 to 0 35 while the in situ sm and the revised cci sm wavered in the range of about 0 1 to 0 2 indicating that the revision method eliminate most systematic difference the time series of the anomalies of in situ sm cci sm and revised cci sm fig 4b illustrated their consistent change trends as well as abnormally low values from winter 2009 to spring 2010 corresponding with the duration of the severe drought disaster although the revised cci sm fluctuated weaker than in situ sm and original cci sm it could detect drought event in yunnan province as its values were significantly lower during the drought period than other periods 3 4 long term changes in revised cci sm 3 4 1 long term changes on a monthly scale cci sm combined product s quality was unsatisfied in some periods e g there were too few valid grids in the daily image to cover the whole province with data or there were only a few days with valid data each month and the average condition of the month could not be represented these defective data covered from august 1987 to july 1991 february 2001 to may 2001 and march 2003 to december 2005 and has been excluded in this study the details of the quality control are described in the discussion section 4 1 we employed the revised cci sm from three periods including the first period from november 1978 to july 1987 with a total of 105 months the second period from august 1991 to february 2003 except january march 1992 and february may 2001 with a total of 132 months and the third period from january 2006 to december 2016 with a total of 132 months it should be noted that every month in the first period only had nine days with images which included 210 valid grids its medium representativeness resulted in an acceptable performance so the changes in sm during this period were still explored the time series of the monthly revised cci sm and precipitation in yunnan province fig 5 a c and e suggested that both had significant seasonal cycles with higher values in summer and lower values in winter the seasonal cycle of revised cci sm lagged precipitation by approximately one month which is consistent with the results reported by wang et al 2016 the revised cci sm had a significant p 0 01 correlation with precipitation with r values of 0 49 0 86 and 0 86 in the three periods respectively indicating that surface sm had a high agreement with precipitation in the second and third periods but a moderate agreement in the first period due to its limited quality the time series of the smoothed revised cci sma and pa using the moving average method makridakis and wheelwright 1983 fig 5b d and f suggested that these metrics have similar variation patterns in general both fluctuated slightly without obvious trends during the first and second periods then they sharply decreased from 2009 to 2010 and gradually increased from 2011 to 2015 indicating that sm had recovered after suffering severe drought from 2009 to 2010 which was consistent with the total water storage from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace ma et al 2017 droughts reflected by the monthly revised cci sm occurred eighteen times in three periods table 3 including one extreme drought in december 2009 that lasted three months four serious droughts in february 1986 june 1986 may 1987 may 1997 two moderate droughts in november 1984 and march 1987 and eleven slight droughts fig 5 in the first period there were ten droughts including five slight droughts two moderate droughts and three serious droughts the drought in the spring of 1987 was the most severe in this period which included a moderate drought in march and a serious drought in may six droughts occurred in the second period including five slight droughts and one serious drought in may 1997 this serious drought was reported by the yunnan disaster reduction yearbook editorial committee 1999 which led to 10 400 km2 of crop damage and left 5 14 million people and 6 43 million livestock without drinking water in the third period there were two droughts including one slight drought and one extreme drought from december 2009 to february 2010 which lasted three months during this extreme drought the precipitation was 48 less than the average of the same period and broke the minimum historical record and the maximum temperature was 2 4 c higher than the maximum historical record which caused severe damage to the socioeconomic development and ecology of yunnan province yunnan disaster reduction yearbook editorial committee 2012 of the eighteen times of sm droughts thirteen times occurred in dry seasons and five times occurred in monsoon seasons among of which four times were in the first period the drought was more likely to occur during the dry season which mainly because the absolute values of precipitation and sm in the dry season were less and their slight changes could induce severe and extreme droughts therefore the impact of droughts in dry season have less impact than that during the monsoon season overall many droughts occurred before the extreme drought in 2009 and mainly distributed in dry seasons it seemed that frequency of drought decreased but the severity of drought increased in the 21st century 3 4 2 long term changes on a seasonal scale long term changes in the provincial averages of the revised cci sm and precipitation in spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february were investigated fig 6 the r values between the revised cci sm and precipitation in spring summer autumn and winter in the first period were 0 73 p 0 05 0 11 0 50 and 0 98 p 0 01 in the second period they were 0 93 p 0 01 0 75 p 0 01 0 80 p 0 01 0 67 p 0 05 and in the third period the r values were 0 14 0 76 p 0 0 1 0 80 p 0 01 0 89 p 0 01 respectively there was a good correlation between the revised cci sm and precipitation on a seasonal scale in both the second and third periods except spring in the third period in the first period the similar values of four seasons and slight correlation coefficient probably was the result of worse data quality further details in the discussion section 4 1 the trends of most seasons in the three periods were not significant indicating that the seasonal revised cci sm had no evident and reliable trends for long term changes in surface sm some differences between sm and precipitation were found in terms of the revised cci sm in the second and third periods the values in winter and spring were closer and lower than the values in autumn and summer however for precipitation the values in spring and autumn were very close and the values in winter were the lowest fig 6b which proves the response time of sm to precipitation spring generally lacks precipitation but water demand of crops increases leading to a continuous deficit and reduction in sm therefore sm is more sensitive to agricultural drought and more conducive to detecting agricultural drought a total of twenty one droughts were reflected by the seasonal revised cci sm including twenty slight droughts and one moderate drought the droughts mainly occurred in autumn eight times and winter seven times a severe drought was detected in 2009 and 2010 indicating that the seasonal revised cci sm has the ability to reflect severe drought however of these twenty one droughts there were only eight droughts including months with drought while the remaining thirteen droughts did not include months with drought in addition the droughts reflected by the seasonal data only contain two grades of slight drought and moderate drought the limitation of seasonal sm to detect drought may be because the process of calculating average of sm from three months to one seasonal offset the features of abnormally low values in drought months overall seasonal revised sm struggles to detect drought correctly and accurately so it may be better to monitor and analyze droughts using the cci sm series on monthly or fine scales 4 discussion 4 1 data quality of cci sm the monthly cci sm combined product fluctuated abnormally and had no obvious seasonal variation in yunnan province in some periods fig 7 a in order to explore the causation of this abnormal phenomenon the number of valid grids in daily cci sm images and the number of days with valid data each month from november 1978 to december 2016 were counted fig 7b according to the quality of cci sm we divided the entire study period into five segments including two segments with poor quality segment 2 august 1987 to july 1991 and segment 4 march 2003 to december 2005 one period with medium quality segment 1 november 1978 to july 1987 and two periods with good quality segment 3 august 1991 to february 2003 and segment 5 january 2006 to december 2016 for the two periods with poor quality there were only 2 grids in daily cci sm and only 12 days with valid data each month in segment 2 14 grids per day and 19 days per month in segment 4 the data in segment 2 and segment 4 could not represent the provincial sm conditions because it could not cover the entire province the average numbers of grids and days were 210 and 9 in segment 1 respectively indicating that the data in segment 1 had limited representativeness in segment 3 there were 160 grids each day and 24 days with valid data each month and 299 grids each day and 30 days with valid data each month in segment 5 indicating that these data could cover the entire province and were available almost daily three reasons are possible for the poor quality of cci sm in some periods first just a small number of active and passive microwave products participated in blending at the early stage e g only smmr or ssm i was used in segment 1 fig 7 at this stage there were no data in many gaps between adjacent scanning strips second some data were discarded in the process of blending because they did not reach the convergence criteria due to their significant deviation liu et al 2012 the third possible reason is that the failure and pause of the sensors led to a reduction in data coverage dorigo et al 2015 loew et al 2013 overall cci sm product needs validation before use chen 2015 dorigo et al 2017 the data quality has shown significant improvement due to the growing number of satellites improvements in the instrumentation design and sensor performance and the development of rigorous blending scheme gruber et al 2017 indicating that cci sm has great potential to obtain better performance for monitoring surface sm in the future 4 2 comparison of droughts reflected by precipitation and sm on the monthly scale sm droughts and meteorological droughts rarely occurred in summer and usually occurred in winter which was dominated by the natural law of uneven precipitation distribution it is different that meteorological droughts were more than sm droughts in autumn because sm could decrease slowly due to its water storage capacity inversely sm drought might be more likely to happen than meteorological drought in spring because increasing water requirement of crop lead to continuous deficit and reduction of sm in terms of quantity the meteorological drought was more than sm drought because meteorological droughts for a single month generally could not cause significant scarcity of sm 4 3 uncertainty 4 3 1 uncertainty of in situ sm there is extensive horizontal variability in surface sm which are caused by complex interactions between factors of soil terrain vegetation and meteorology crow et al 2012 these uncertainties are difficult to separate and quantify variations in soil such as texture organic matter content porosity and structure can influence the spatial patterns of sm for instance panciera 2009 showed that soils with higher sand content exhibited consistently drier sm conditions than soils with lower sand content terrain also plays an important role specifically its increase in heterogeneity lead to an increased in sm changes charpentier and groffman 1992 because alterations in slope aspect curvature and relative elevation all have impact on the dynamic of surface sm the type of land use directly affects hydrological process which controls the level of sm and it brings more dynamic influence on sm compared to soil and terrain factors meteorological factors such as solar radiation wind and humidity can all alter level and distribution of sm but precipitation is the most important meteorological forcing factor as it is one of the primary sources of soil water 18 in situ sm stations were affected different environment so the slope and interception of liner relationship between in situ sm and cci sm at each station differed greatly fig 3 for this reason it is very appropriate and necessary to make the utmost of the information at each station in the revision process 4 3 2 uncertainty of cci sm uncertainties of cci sm mainly come from sensors orbitals environments algorithms and post processing dorigo et al 2017 the products involved in generating the cci sm were based on different sensors which penetrated different depths of soil and their individual errors eventually propagated to the combined product in addition the three products of cci sm have different performances the active product has better agreement in areas covered by moderate vegetation while the passive product has better performance in bare and sparsely vegetated areas liu et al 2012 the combined product used in this paper has high spatial temporal coverage but simultaneously sacrifice the accuracy of the data yuan et al 2015 4 3 3 uncertainty of revision there are four aspects of uncertainty in revision method the first aspect is the differences in depths accessible by in situ measurement and satellite observation cci sm is considered to represent sm condition at few centimeters below the surface while in situ sm was measured at depth of 10 cm but comprising these two kinds of sm is still feasible because there was a good correlation between near surface layer 0 2 5 cm and deeper sm 2 5 30 5 cm rezaul and kenneth 2007 and numerous studies have adopted the validation of cci sm against in situ sm at 10 cm an et al 2016 dorigo et al 2015 peng et al 2015 uncertainty also derived from the discrepancy in spatial scales between in situ sm and cci sm in situ sm measured at a specific point can only represent a limited range due to high spatial heterogeneity of sm while each grid of the cci sm image can signify the average sm over an approximately 28 28 km2 this huge difference in area means a difference in land use types of the 18 stations only 7 stations had the same land use type as the main land use type corresponding to the cci sm grids 11 stations had land use types of cropland among which the main type of just 4 corresponding cci sm grids was cropland which mainly because the focus of in situ sm observation was on agriculture the sum of proportion of cropland grassland and forest was greater than 90 in all grids which indicates that the uncertainty is less impacted by bare soil table 4 however it still brought some uncertainties for instance panciera 2009 reported that in terms of sm at satellite footprint sm in crop areas was higher than average and sm in forest areas was lower than average while grassland could best represent average sm conditions how to reduce the uncertainties of different land use types remains a difficult task in the next work we will try to improve revision method based on the proportion of land use types in each cci sm grid thirdly relationship between in situ sm and the corresponding cci sm grid was used to revise for all the grids within a thiessen polygon due to the spatial heterogeneity of sm the actual influence of the revision formula was supposed to gradually decrease from station to boundary however it remained the same in current method resulting in significant deviations at the boundary where sm should normally be continuous and smooth the last aspect of uncertainty came from the discrepancy in sm during dry and monsoon seasons the current revision method could eliminate the systematic difference between cci sm and in situ sm however the revision method probably to be improved after comprehensive experiments such as revising the cci sm based on the separation of the dry and monsoon seasons we will improve it in the further work 5 conclusions long term changes in surface sm in yunnan province were investigated using cci sm and in situ sm the following conclusions were made 1 cci sm and in situ sm in yunnan province had similar trends of temporal variations and a systematic difference the revised cci sm had no overall deviation from in situ sm and had an abnormally low value during the severe drought from 2009 to 2010 indicating that the revised cci sm can be used to detect droughts 2 droughts detected by monthly revised cci sm mainly occurred during dry season additionally the frequency of droughts seemed to decrease but the severity of droughts increased in the 21st century the seasonal sm only detected slight and moderate droughts so it is challenging to monitor droughts correctly and accurately 3 the quality of cci sm data was not stable at an early stage because of few grids in the daily images or few days with valid data each month thus it needs to be quality controlled before use cci sm provides a better tool to analyze long term changes in sm and detected drought more comprehensive than only using in situ observations credit authorship

5337,simulation of flow and transport of sediment in alluvial rivers particularly during release of water through dams is a complex problem such simulations are generally carried out using various numerical models subject to availability of requisite morphological and sediment data sets in addition various simplifying assumptions quite often are part and parcel of most of the available numerical sediment transport models as such non compliance of any of the assumptions or non availability of all the requite data sets restricts meaningful use of any numerical simulator in estimation of morphological changes in alluvial rives this study attempts to resolve such issues associated with numerical models by using artificial neural networks ann the primary objective of the study is to explore and identify best performing ann models in estimating morphological changes in alluvial rivers in the present study the one dimensional hydrodynamic modelling system hec ras hydrologic engineering centre s river analysis system is employed for generating database to train multilayer feedforward networks mlfn performance evaluations of all the developed mlfn models are made by using three statistical parameters i e mean square error mse mean absolute error mae and coefficient of determination r2 the study reveals that there are multiple ann models stretching across different training algorithms and transfer functions which can be reliably used in developing sediment transport models in alluvial rivers keywords sediment transport alluvial river artificial neural network multilayer feedforward network hec ras 1 introduction the flow and transport of sediment in an alluvial river is unsteady and non uniform this makes assessment of morphological changes like aggradation i e increase in riverbed level and degradation i e lowering of riverbed level difficult any kind of obstruction say construction of dams can disturb the river flow equilibrium and result in morphological changes dam construction traps the sediment upstream of dam and releasing of clearer water can affect downstream river area xu 1990 xu 2001 downs and gregory 2004 many studies have illustrated the problem in estimating sedimentation on regulated rivers with gate operated hydraulic structure as compared to such estimation on natural rivers without any hydraulic structure kantoush et al 2010 wohl and rathburn 2003 brandt 2000 phillips et al 2005 have described the influence of livingston dam texas in the form of scour for about 60 km downstream of trinity river schimdt and wilcock 2008 computed three matrices for 61 dam impacted river reaches in western united states shin and julien 2010 have shown the effect of daily flow pulses from peak hydropower generation in the downstream channel of hapcheon dam south korea in a recent study li et al 2019 have focused on the responses of zhicheng and shashi reach of yangtze river to the three gorges dam operation there always have been several thoughts before selection of an appropriate method for estimating river morphological changes the solution from every method depends on time space nature of the problem available resources desired accuracy and associated cost papanicolaou et al 2008 over the years the sediment transport models have developed from one dimensional models wu et al 2004 to two dimensional ones zavattero et al 2016 guan and liang 2017 and subsequently to three dimensional models wu et al 2000 burkow and griebel 2016 török et al 2017 sawadogo et al 2019 to estimate sedimentation in an alluvial river as reported in literature and as expected one dimensional model requires a reduced amount of data and provides stability with less computational efforts over two and three dimensional models werner 2001 horritt and bates 2002 the one dimensional hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras is a well known sediment hydrodynamic model which is also used for flood forecasting timbadiya et al 2011 kute et al 2014 zainalfikry et al 2002 and dam break analysis gee 2010 xiong 2011 sharma and majumdar 2016 kilania and chahar 2019 the capability of hec ras to perform sediment transport simulation is reported in many studies including the one by gibson 2006 haghiabi and zaredehdasht 2012 have identified critical erodible points and areas which are prone to sedimentation along karun river over a length of 110 km using hec ras hec ras model is also employed by motallebian and hassanpour 2013 in estimating sedimentation and erosion in sisan river over a length of 47 km mustafa et al 2017 evaluated sediment transport and water quality in euphrates river using hec ras 4 1 ghimire and devantier 2016 examined the sediment deposition and dredging issues in lower ohio river with the help of one dimensional quasi unsteady hec ras module in conjunction with arc gis mohammad et al 2016 used hec ras 4 1 for simulation of flow and sediment transport in mosul dam joshi et al 2019 studied the importance of sediment flow and river bed characteristics using hec ras with hec georas extension in arcgis environment to generate geometric data solving sedimentation problem with hydrodynamic sediment transport models has its own capabilities and limitations most importantly availability of spatio temporal data relating to physical and geomorphological properties of an alluvial river along with boundary and initial conditions is a pre requisite to using any sediment transport model but availability of precise and complete data sets necessary for using the numerical models may not be always ensured the overall cost and time associated with collection of data can also be a distracting factor such scenarios can seriously restrict use of numerical models in the simulation of sediment transport in alluvial rivers an alternative to sediment transport modelling without the requirement of all the requisite parameters is therefore needed papanicolaou et al 2008 to handle such limitations of sediment numerical models many studies have prescribed use of artificial neural network ann in sediment transport modelling peters et al 2006 tayfur et al 2005 chang et al 2012 a wide range of applications of ann in the field of water resource is also available hsu et al 1995 coulibaly et al 2000 asce task committee 2000 dawson and wilby 2001 these studies include use of ann in river flow prediction wu and chau 2010 kalteh 2013 rainfall runoff modelling chen et al 2013 dounia et al 2016 flood forecasting mukerji et al 2009 chu et al 2020 and reservoir operation optimization problem chandramouli and deka 2005 there are quite a large number of literatures available which deal with application of ann in sediment transport in alluvial rivers summary of all such studies involving application of ann in sediment transport modelling along with the training algorithm and transfer function used therein is given in table 1 as can be seen from table 1 majority of the studies used back propagation algorithm for training and sigmoid transfer activation function for developing the ann models a few studies have used some other transfer functions also however the reason for choosing the particular training algorithm and or transfer function has not been reported there is a necessity therefore to explore performance of various training algorithms and transfer functions in modelling sediment transport in alluvial rivers using ann as reported kitsikoudis et al 2015 the performance and complexity of a neural network is influenced by the choice of learning rate momentum gain of the transfer function epoch size and network geometry as per the knowledge of the authors performance of varying training algorithms and transfer functions has not been adequately addressed till date in any of the studies involving application of ann in sediment transport modelling in alluvial rivers the present study focuses on exploring capability of ann in simulating sediment transport in alluvial rivers by using geometric data unsteady flow data and sediment data while employing various training algorithms and transfer functions this study attempts to make a comparative assessment of various ann models using different training algorithms and transfer functions in simulation of sediment transport in alluvial rivers the main objective of this study is therefore to identify the best performing ann models which can reliably assess aggradation and degradation in alluvial rivers 2 methods and materials 2 1 governing equations of sediment transport aggradation and degradation in the alluvial river systems resulting in morphological changes can be conceived as a two phase flow problem occurring simultaneously in the liquid water and the solid sediment phases a set of three nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations viz the shallow water equation for discharge mass balance eq 1 the momentum balance in the liquidphase eq 2 and the sediment continuity equation eq 3 the exner equation in the solid phase mathematically describe the physical phenomena these equations are shown as under 1 a t t q x 0 2 q t q v x g a z x s f 0 3 1 λ p b η x q s x 0 where at total flow area q flow x distance v velocity g acceleration due to gravity z elevation of the water surface s f friction slope b channel width η channel elevation t time x distance λ p active layer porosity q s transported sediment load the conventional approach generally solves these equations employing some numerical methods like finite element finite difference etc the applicability of such numerical methods gets hindered significantly when some of the requisite input data along with the initial and the boundary conditions are not available artificial neural network can be an effective tool for modelling the process when the requisite data are either scarce or incomplete 2 2 artificial neural network neural networks are comprised of simple elements that can perform the specified task without any mathematical expression ann models are developed as a generalization of mathematical models of human cognition asce task committee 2000 among many neural network structures the most common one used in the field of hydrology is multilayer feed forward network rumelhart et al 1986 where data flows in one direction such mlfns can model any linear as well as nonlinear systems as shown in figure 1 it has three different layers like wu1 a input layer all the inputs are fed in the model through this layer b hidden layer there can be more than one hidden layer which is used for processing the inputs received from the input layer and c output layer the data after processing is made available at the output layer a neural network consists of a large number of simple processing elements or units known as nodes or neurons which are connected with each other by direct communication links with associated weights raman and chandramouli 1996 the response of a node to the total input signal it receives is called an activation function the activation functions used in various studies are logistic sigmoid bipolar sigmoid linear sigmoid plus liner and cubic polynomial 2 2 1 back propagation neural network bpnn the process by which a neural network determines its weight is called learning or training the most widely used learning rule for training a neural network is feed forward back propagation algorithm and is developed by rumelhart et al 1986 the back propagation algorithm is essentially a gradient descent technique that minimizes the network error function where the error is propagated backwards through the network to each node and the connection weights are adjusted according to the following equation eq 4 4 δ w ij n ε e w ij α δ w ij n 1 where δ w ij n and δ w ij n 1 are weight increments between node i and j during n th and n 1 th epoch ε and α are learning rate and the momentum respectively during the training the weights are adjusted by the back propagation algorithm to reduce the residual error e as detailed in eq 5 of the training set 5 e p p y i t i 2 where p is the number of training patterns p is the number of output nodes y i is the respective neural network output t i is the component of the desired output t 2 2 2 training algorithm the training of an ann involves tuning the weights and biases values of the network to optimize network performance standard numerical optimization algorithms can be used to optimize network performance these optimization algorithms use either the gradient of the performance of the network with respect to the network weights or the jacobian of the network errors with respect to the weights in this study the neural network toolbox in matlab is employed for ann modelling the fourteen training functions and three transfer functions provided in matlab nn toolbox are utilised for the purpose table 2 and table 3 all the training computations are conducted in intel r xenon r w 2145 processor 64 gb ram and in intel r core tm i7 4770 4 gb ram the models are randomly simulated in both the computer platforms to accelerate the pace of the work 2 3 methodology an overview of the methodology is given in figure 2 this study involves development of sediment transport ann models using selective data from hydrodynamic sediment numerical modelling hec ras this numerical model is used to generate various realizations required for training and testing of the ann models this section is divided into three parts comprising of hydrodynamic sediment numerical modelling data generation and ann modelling 2 3 1 the hydrodynamic sediment numerical modelling in this study the hydrodynamic sediment numerical modelling is done using hydrologic engineering centre s river analysis system hec ras hydrologic engineering center 2016a b the details of the data used in the study are mentioned in the following sections 2 3 1 1 geometric data the one dimensional river reach considered in this study is given in figure 3 the river section rs60 1 represents the most upstream section and rs36 85 is the most downstream section the targets of the ann models correspond to the bed elevation changes on the downstream reach of the river covering a length of 8 km with 9 sections at river stations rs41 74 rs41 7 rs41 5 rs40 8 rs40 0 rs39 3 rs38 75 rs38 3 and rs36 85 respectively from the dam hydraulic structure the bed elevation change is the change of riverbed from its initial level due to the river discharge in hec ras the negative and positive values of the bed level change is termed as degradation and aggradation respectively the dam gate opening heights are varied between 0 8 m and 5 m for generating the requisite data for the ann models 2 3 1 2 flow data this study uses flow hydrograph as an upstream boundary condition in rs60 1 as shown in figure 4 7 years and 3 years of inflow data is used for training and testing of the neural network models respectively this flow hydrograph has each yearly discharge data record of daily discharge information for a period of 200 days the normal depth of 0 0004 is used as a downstream boundary condition at rs36 85 table 4 lists the maximum and minimum range of upstream and t s gate opening boundary condtions 2 3 1 3 sediment data the sediment data required for the study are taken from carriaga and mays 1995 the present study utilizes the ackers white equation thomas ex5 method and toffaleti equation in the hec ras setting for generating the requisite data for the ann models related sediment data used in the study are provided in table 5 2 3 2 description of data used the hydrodynamic sediment model is simulated several times using a combination of different data sets like gate opening height inflow and sediment gradation data the sediment gradation of the riverbed remains unchanged for all simulations each simulation of sediment transport gives one pattern case for the ann model each simulation is carried out with one fixed gate opening height with 200 days of inflow data altogether 7 sets of gate opening height and 10 sets of 200 days of inflow data sets are used in this study resulting in 91 patterns cases out of the 91 patterns so generated 70 patterns are used for training and the remaining 21 patterns for testing from every simulation the bed elevation changes at all the 9 river sections are obtained for a period of 31 days 2 3 3 artificial neural network ann modelling in the present study ann models are developed to estimate aggradation and or degradation i e bed elevation change over space and time along a one dimensional alluvial river as shown in figure 3 in all the ann models the boundary conditions associated with the flow sediment gradation and dam gate opening heights are taken as the inputs while data constituting bed elevation changes over space and time along the river at selected river stations are considered as the targets the present study employs hec ras for generating patterns required for training testing and validation of the ann models as mentioned earlier a total of 91 patterns are generated for training 70 patterns and testing 21 patterns of the proposed ann models it s obvious of course that other sediment transport models like gstars mike cched are equally applicable for performing such studies in developing the proposed ann models all inputs and targets are normalized prior to being fed to the models using the relationship eq 6 as under 6 x n x i x min x max x min where x n normalization x i actual value x max and x min maximum and minimum measurement values there are two stages in back propagation training and testing in the training stage the network is trained with some input and output patterns in order to check the network ability to validate the results with unknown input patterns testing of the network is done after the normalization the input of array size 414 70 is used to train the network with the target of size 819 70 on the other hand the trained models are tested with data of size 819 70 to complete any ann architecture determination of the appropriate number of neurons in the hidden layer is important in the present study the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer is obtained by trial and error approach this study focuses on finding an appropriate ann model that could address the problem in numerical modelling here various ann models are developed by a combination of training algorithms table 2 and transfer functions table 3 the performance of the developed models is estimated with the help of certain statistical parameters 2 4 performance analyses the performance of the neural network can be evaluated by different criteria as there is no accepted standard procedure ghani et al 2011 but a common procedure for the assessment of neural network performance is the use of mean square error mse mean absolute error mae and co efficient of determination r2 for an ann model to be reliable the values of mse and mae should be closer to 0 0 and r2 be closer to 1 the mathematical formulae for mse mae and r2 are given below 1 mean square error mse mse 1 n i 1 n y observed y p r e d i c t e d 2 2 mean absolute error mae mae 1 n i 1 n y observed y p r e d i c t e d 3 co efficient

r e d i c t e d predicted bed elevation change at time t y observed mean of observed bed elevation changes y predicted mean of predicted bed elevation changes n total number of output attributes 3 results in this study 177 different ann models are developed the difference in the models lies in respect of training algorithms and transfer functions used as well as the optimal number of hidden layer neurons obtained through trial and error performances of all such models based on their mse and r2 are detailed in appendix 1 under tables 1 to 14 the numerical value in the ann identifier represents the number of hidden layer neurons used in the model the letters presented before and after the number are the used training algorithm and transfer function respectively the abbreviation of the training algorithms and transfer functions are given in the table 2 and table 3 respectively based on the results presented in appendix 1 tables 1 to 14 the three best performing models against each training algorithm used are selected performance analyses of all the 42 models 3 models from each of 14 training algorithms based on mse mae and r2 are presented in table 6 in order to ensure clarity each model is provided with the same colour code shade the results presented in table 6 clearly show that the performances of more than one ann model are satisfactory such models stretch across different training algorithms and transfer functions in the present study of course the rp9l model is found to be the most reliable with the values of mse and mae equalling 0 0122 and 0 07150 respectively and the value of r2 equalling 0 9763 as can be seen from table 6 performances of many other models are also found to be satisfactory this clearly indicates that there is more than one ann model that can be used for developing sediment transport ann models for alluvial rivers in the present study an attempt is made to rank all such models based on their respective total score table 7 presents these results the performance of rp9l model table 6 for example is found to be the best in respect of mse mae and r2 in other words rp9l secures rank 1 in respect of mse mae and r2 accordingly the total score of rp9l is calculated as 3 1 1 1 3 as such a model with lower total score is considered better as compared to the other with a higher total score such classification of ann models based on scoring is also reported in khatibi et al 2011 a critical look at the details presented in table 7 it can be inferred that as many as four training algorithms viz resilient back propagation bayesian regularization back propagation scaled conjugate gradient back propagation and bfgs quasi newton back propagation outperform others in respect of total scoring comparative plots bed elevation change from hec ras vs respective bed elevation change from ann in respect of these four training algorithms viz rp9l br9t scg13t and bfg10l are presented in figure 5 in all these plots bed elevation changes at all the nine river stations at the end of each day throughout the simulation period of 91 days are considered the final bed elevation changes at the nine river stations for the same ann models are also presented in figure 6 it s worth mentioning that the negative and positive values of bed elevation change represent degradation and aggradation respectively in figure 5 a straight line making an angle of 45 with abscissa is drawn for a perfect ann model all data i e both hec ras simulated and ann estimated bed elevation changes should ideally fall on these lines the plots presented in figure 5 reveal that the data bands around the straight lines are narrow in case of rp9l and br9t ann models while for the other two ann models viz scg13t and bfg10l the bands are wide particularly for lower values of bed elevation changes however as shown in figure 6 for the final bed elevation changes at the respective river stations the performances of all the four ann models are more or less similar 3 1 validation of the methodology with and without target data perturbation the process of transport of sediments in alluvial rivers is influenced by the independent parameters dictating the process for this study the independent parameters are flow gate opening height and sediment gradation any change in the independent variables leads to variation in the output many studies consider either field or experimental data to train and test a neural network model quite often these data comprise of various errors thereby jeopardizing ann model accuracy also sometimes it is difficult to get accurate and complete set of required data sets this study uses hec ras to generate the data sets to train and test the ann models for the developed ann models the bed elevation changes along the river stretch are taken as targets the targets are assumed to be dependent on gate opening height flow and sediment gradation for developing the ann models the data sets i e bed elevation change obtained from hec ras are used as targets in order to assess the model performances with erroneous data sensitivity analyses are also performed in sensitivity analyses the target data sets i e bed elevation change are perturbed by incorporating uniformly distributed errors the percentage of errors considered in this study are 1 5 and 10 results obtained from ann models using unperturbed target data are presented in table 6 ten best performing models obtained using unperturbed data are taken for sensitivity analyses the corresponding ann models are redeveloped using perturbed target data sets such results are presented in table 7 3 1 1 results from sensitivity analyses in table 8 the results of 10 best performing ann models as presented in table 7 with and without perturbed target data sets are presented the performance measures as presented in table 7 are considered as actual these actual values of performance measures are presented along with the corresponding performance measure values obtained using different percentages of errors incorporated in the target data sets the bar diagrams of all such results are also presented in figs 7 9 4 discussion the study primarily focuses on exploring and identifying appropriate neural network models for estimating bed elevation change in an alluvial river the main objective of the study is to assess performances of different ann models using varying training algorithms and transfer functions in sediment transport modelling in this study fourteen different training algorithms including three different transfer functions with an optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer are employed to develop 177 ann models appendix 1 tables 1 to 14 as mentioned in appendix 1 under tables 1 to 14 the performance of the models is analysed using mse and r2 all the models are carefully examined and three models are chosen depending on their performance measure in literature there is no mention of any range of performance measure values to determine the efficiency of an ann model for reliable modelling of sediment transport the values of mse mae and r2 should be closer to 0 0 and 1 respectively in table 6 42 ann models are listed according to their varying performance measure all the reported models have more or less acceptable performance measure values as can be seen in table 6 four ann models have r2 values above 0 9 this indicates a stronger relation of independent variables gate opening height inflow and sediment gradation data with the dependent variables bed elevation change two of these models have a combination of resilient back propagation and log sigmoid transfer function while the other two have bayesian regularization back propagation and hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function it is noticeable from table 6 that scaled conjugate gradient back propagation bfgs quasi newton back propagation conjugate gradient and powell beale restarts back propagation conjugate gradient and polar ribiere updates back propagation with log sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer functions have the ability to produce good results as the numerical simulator as shown in figure 5 the performance of the models can be easily established performance measure values of these models also indicate stronger relationships between the independent and the dependent variables figure 6 presents the performance comparison of hec ras and neural network models to demonstrate the performances of the developed ann models four different training algorithms with two transfer functions are considered in figure 5 and figure 6 in the present study the models with the performance value r2 less than or equal to 0 79 are considered as unsuitable models though it doesn t mean the discarded models are not suitable at all for estimating bed level change a scoring system approach helps in identifying an appropriate number of models based on their performance scores table 7 shows ten suitable models ranked as per their scores this study also shows that four out of fourteen training algorithms and two out of three transfer functions available in matlab nn toolbox outperform other training algorithms and transfer functions but the strength of the discarded training algorithms and transfer functions cannot be neglected which is pointed out in other works reported in literature sensitivity analyses estimate susceptibility of the models to the different percentage of errors incorporated in the target data in the case of mse 21 23 and 31 decrease in model performances are observed with the error of 1 5 and 10 respectively on the other hand the lower value of mae shows that the perturbed models deviate with an average of 13 16 and 20 respctively with respect to above mentioned error inclusion although the perturbed models vary slightly in establishing the relation between the input and the output than the actual ones yet their performances are found to be more or less satisfactory simulation of sediment transport is not an easy task due to unsteady behaviour of the involved processes to replicate such phenomenon with an numerical model detailed sediment data of the entire domain is required in practical cases theavailability of data varying with respect to space and time is tough apart from the sediment data such a numerical model needs parameter values also e g manning s coefficient contraction or expansion coefficient in hec ras to complete the computation these parameters generally have a certain range and have different values for different cases due to lack of correct values of such parameters model performances get hampered the problem of convergence and instability is always associated with numerical models papanicolaou et al 2008 have reviewed the pros and cons of a numerical based computational model tayfur et al 2005 have also compared the performance of the numerical method and artificial neural network as per their studies neural networks can produce results as good as the traditional numerical models which require spatio temporal data the application of neural networks is simple as it can recognise the pattern between the input and target data sets without requiring all the requisite data necessitated in numerical models the approach adopted in this study in respect of generating requisite data sets using hec ras a numerical sediment transport simulator is nothing new peters et al 2006 for example have trained their neural network model in solving flood routing problem using data generated by hec ras but their methodology did not cover testing influence of training algorithms transfer functions as well as other vital parameters of neural network maca et al 2014 have analysed the influence of 12 different transfer functions and 7 training algorithms in flood runoff forecasting they recommended that different transfer functions be tested during training of ann models yonaba et al 2010 have utilised different transfer functions with levenberg marquardt back propagation and bayesian regularization in streamflow forecasting as per the knowledge of the authors no attempt has yet been made to assess the performance of different training algorithms and transfer functions in estimating sediment transport in alluvial rivers using ann in table 1 various studies using a variety of training algorithms and transfer functions in sediment transport modelling using ann are mentioned although none of the studies has explicitly mentioned about suitability of other training algorithms and or transfer functions in solving the problem this present study has at least established suitability of different training algorithms and transfer functions in satisfactorily modelling sediment transport processes in alluvial rivers 5 conclusion in this study the artificial neural network ann is employed for the simulation of sediment transport in an alluvial river different types of training algorithm and transfer function are used to find ann models that are expected to yield reliable results in sediment transport modelling in the present study only three independent variables viz inflow sediment gradation and gate opening height are used as inputs while the bed elevation changes along the river stretch are taken as the targets it s obvious that with these inputs estimation of bed elevation changes is not at all possible when a numerical simulator is intended to be used the main outcome of the study lies in the fact that many ann models with combination of different training algorithms and transfer functions are capable of estimating the bed elevation changes in alluvial rivers even when only three input variables data as cited above are available the study also assessed that even when the target data sets are erroneous the performance of a few ann models is satisfactory one of the limitations of the study is of course that the models are not tested with other input data sets except inflow gate opening height and sediment gradation data declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

5337,simulation of flow and transport of sediment in alluvial rivers particularly during release of water through dams is a complex problem such simulations are generally carried out using various numerical models subject to availability of requisite morphological and sediment data sets in addition various simplifying assumptions quite often are part and parcel of most of the available numerical sediment transport models as such non compliance of any of the assumptions or non availability of all the requite data sets restricts meaningful use of any numerical simulator in estimation of morphological changes in alluvial rives this study attempts to resolve such issues associated with numerical models by using artificial neural networks ann the primary objective of the study is to explore and identify best performing ann models in estimating morphological changes in alluvial rivers in the present study the one dimensional hydrodynamic modelling system hec ras hydrologic engineering centre s river analysis system is employed for generating database to train multilayer feedforward networks mlfn performance evaluations of all the developed mlfn models are made by using three statistical parameters i e mean square error mse mean absolute error mae and coefficient of determination r2 the study reveals that there are multiple ann models stretching across different training algorithms and transfer functions which can be reliably used in developing sediment transport models in alluvial rivers keywords sediment transport alluvial river artificial neural network multilayer feedforward network hec ras 1 introduction the flow and transport of sediment in an alluvial river is unsteady and non uniform this makes assessment of morphological changes like aggradation i e increase in riverbed level and degradation i e lowering of riverbed level difficult any kind of obstruction say construction of dams can disturb the river flow equilibrium and result in morphological changes dam construction traps the sediment upstream of dam and releasing of clearer water can affect downstream river area xu 1990 xu 2001 downs and gregory 2004 many studies have illustrated the problem in estimating sedimentation on regulated rivers with gate operated hydraulic structure as compared to such estimation on natural rivers without any hydraulic structure kantoush et al 2010 wohl and rathburn 2003 brandt 2000 phillips et al 2005 have described the influence of livingston dam texas in the form of scour for about 60 km downstream of trinity river schimdt and wilcock 2008 computed three matrices for 61 dam impacted river reaches in western united states shin and julien 2010 have shown the effect of daily flow pulses from peak hydropower generation in the downstream channel of hapcheon dam south korea in a recent study li et al 2019 have focused on the responses of zhicheng and shashi reach of yangtze river to the three gorges dam operation there always have been several thoughts before selection of an appropriate method for estimating river morphological changes the solution from every method depends on time space nature of the problem available resources desired accuracy and associated cost papanicolaou et al 2008 over the years the sediment transport models have developed from one dimensional models wu et al 2004 to two dimensional ones zavattero et al 2016 guan and liang 2017 and subsequently to three dimensional models wu et al 2000 burkow and griebel 2016 török et al 2017 sawadogo et al 2019 to estimate sedimentation in an alluvial river as reported in literature and as expected one dimensional model requires a reduced amount of data and provides stability with less computational efforts over two and three dimensional models werner 2001 horritt and bates 2002 the one dimensional hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras is a well known sediment hydrodynamic model which is also used for flood forecasting timbadiya et al 2011 kute et al 2014 zainalfikry et al 2002 and dam break analysis gee 2010 xiong 2011 sharma and majumdar 2016 kilania and chahar 2019 the capability of hec ras to perform sediment transport simulation is reported in many studies including the one by gibson 2006 haghiabi and zaredehdasht 2012 have identified critical erodible points and areas which are prone to sedimentation along karun river over a length of 110 km using hec ras hec ras model is also employed by motallebian and hassanpour 2013 in estimating sedimentation and erosion in sisan river over a length of 47 km mustafa et al 2017 evaluated sediment transport and water quality in euphrates river using hec ras 4 1 ghimire and devantier 2016 examined the sediment deposition and dredging issues in lower ohio river with the help of one dimensional quasi unsteady hec ras module in conjunction with arc gis mohammad et al 2016 used hec ras 4 1 for simulation of flow and sediment transport in mosul dam joshi et al 2019 studied the importance of sediment flow and river bed characteristics using hec ras with hec georas extension in arcgis environment to generate geometric data solving sedimentation problem with hydrodynamic sediment transport models has its own capabilities and limitations most importantly availability of spatio temporal data relating to physical and geomorphological properties of an alluvial river along with boundary and initial conditions is a pre requisite to using any sediment transport model but availability of precise and complete data sets necessary for using the numerical models may not be always ensured the overall cost and time associated with collection of data can also be a distracting factor such scenarios can seriously restrict use of numerical models in the simulation of sediment transport in alluvial rivers an alternative to sediment transport modelling without the requirement of all the requisite parameters is therefore needed papanicolaou et al 2008 to handle such limitations of sediment numerical models many studies have prescribed use of artificial neural network ann in sediment transport modelling peters et al 2006 tayfur et al 2005 chang et al 2012 a wide range of applications of ann in the field of water resource is also available hsu et al 1995 coulibaly et al 2000 asce task committee 2000 dawson and wilby 2001 these studies include use of ann in river flow prediction wu and chau 2010 kalteh 2013 rainfall runoff modelling chen et al 2013 dounia et al 2016 flood forecasting mukerji et al 2009 chu et al 2020 and reservoir operation optimization problem chandramouli and deka 2005 there are quite a large number of literatures available which deal with application of ann in sediment transport in alluvial rivers summary of all such studies involving application of ann in sediment transport modelling along with the training algorithm and transfer function used therein is given in table 1 as can be seen from table 1 majority of the studies used back propagation algorithm for training and sigmoid transfer activation function for developing the ann models a few studies have used some other transfer functions also however the reason for choosing the particular training algorithm and or transfer function has not been reported there is a necessity therefore to explore performance of various training algorithms and transfer functions in modelling sediment transport in alluvial rivers using ann as reported kitsikoudis et al 2015 the performance and complexity of a neural network is influenced by the choice of learning rate momentum gain of the transfer function epoch size and network geometry as per the knowledge of the authors performance of varying training algorithms and transfer functions has not been adequately addressed till date in any of the studies involving application of ann in sediment transport modelling in alluvial rivers the present study focuses on exploring capability of ann in simulating sediment transport in alluvial rivers by using geometric data unsteady flow data and sediment data while employing various training algorithms and transfer functions this study attempts to make a comparative assessment of various ann models using different training algorithms and transfer functions in simulation of sediment transport in alluvial rivers the main objective of this study is therefore to identify the best performing ann models which can reliably assess aggradation and degradation in alluvial rivers 2 methods and materials 2 1 governing equations of sediment transport aggradation and degradation in the alluvial river systems resulting in morphological changes can be conceived as a two phase flow problem occurring simultaneously in the liquid water and the solid sediment phases a set of three nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations viz the shallow water equation for discharge mass balance eq 1 the momentum balance in the liquidphase eq 2 and the sediment continuity equation eq 3 the exner equation in the solid phase mathematically describe the physical phenomena these equations are shown as under 1 a t t q x 0 2 q t q v x g a z x s f 0 3 1 λ p b η x q s x 0 where at total flow area q flow x distance v velocity g acceleration due to gravity z elevation of the water surface s f friction slope b channel width η channel elevation t time x distance λ p active layer porosity q s transported sediment load the conventional approach generally solves these equations employing some numerical methods like finite element finite difference etc the applicability of such numerical methods gets hindered significantly when some of the requisite input data along with the initial and the boundary conditions are not available artificial neural network can be an effective tool for modelling the process when the requisite data are either scarce or incomplete 2 2 artificial neural network neural networks are comprised of simple elements that can perform the specified task without any mathematical expression ann models are developed as a generalization of mathematical models of human cognition asce task committee 2000 among many neural network structures the most common one used in the field of hydrology is multilayer feed forward network rumelhart et al 1986 where data flows in one direction such mlfns can model any linear as well as nonlinear systems as shown in figure 1 it has three different layers like wu1 a input layer all the inputs are fed in the model through this layer b hidden layer there can be more than one hidden layer which is used for processing the inputs received from the input layer and c output layer the data after processing is made available at the output layer a neural network consists of a large number of simple processing elements or units known as nodes or neurons which are connected with each other by direct communication links with associated weights raman and chandramouli 1996 the response of a node to the total input signal it receives is called an activation function the activation functions used in various studies are logistic sigmoid bipolar sigmoid linear sigmoid plus liner and cubic polynomial 2 2 1 back propagation neural network bpnn the process by which a neural network determines its weight is called learning or training the most widely used learning rule for training a neural network is feed forward back propagation algorithm and is developed by rumelhart et al 1986 the back propagation algorithm is essentially a gradient descent technique that minimizes the network error function where the error is propagated backwards through the network to each node and the connection weights are adjusted according to the following equation eq 4 4 δ w ij n ε e w ij α δ w ij n 1 where δ w ij n and δ w ij n 1 are weight increments between node i and j during n th and n 1 th epoch ε and α are learning rate and the momentum respectively during the training the weights are adjusted by the back propagation algorithm to reduce the residual error e as detailed in eq 5 of the training set 5 e p p y i t i 2 where p is the number of training patterns p is the number of output nodes y i is the respective neural network output t i is the component of the desired output t 2 2 2 training algorithm the training of an ann involves tuning the weights and biases values of the network to optimize network performance standard numerical optimization algorithms can be used to optimize network performance these optimization algorithms use either the gradient of the performance of the network with respect to the network weights or the jacobian of the network errors with respect to the weights in this study the neural network toolbox in matlab is employed for ann modelling the fourteen training functions and three transfer functions provided in matlab nn toolbox are utilised for the purpose table 2 and table 3 all the training computations are conducted in intel r xenon r w 2145 processor 64 gb ram and in intel r core tm i7 4770 4 gb ram the models are randomly simulated in both the computer platforms to accelerate the pace of the work 2 3 methodology an overview of the methodology is given in figure 2 this study involves development of sediment transport ann models using selective data from hydrodynamic sediment numerical modelling hec ras this numerical model is used to generate various realizations required for training and testing of the ann models this section is divided into three parts comprising of hydrodynamic sediment numerical modelling data generation and ann modelling 2 3 1 the hydrodynamic sediment numerical modelling in this study the hydrodynamic sediment numerical modelling is done using hydrologic engineering centre s river analysis system hec ras hydrologic engineering center 2016a b the details of the data used in the study are mentioned in the following sections 2 3 1 1 geometric data the one dimensional river reach considered in this study is given in figure 3 the river section rs60 1 represents the most upstream section and rs36 85 is the most downstream section the targets of the ann models correspond to the bed elevation changes on the downstream reach of the river covering a length of 8 km with 9 sections at river stations rs41 74 rs41 7 rs41 5 rs40 8 rs40 0 rs39 3 rs38 75 rs38 3 and rs36 85 respectively from the dam hydraulic structure the bed elevation change is the change of riverbed from its initial level due to the river discharge in hec ras the negative and positive values of the bed level change is termed as degradation and aggradation respectively the dam gate opening heights are varied between 0 8 m and 5 m for generating the requisite data for the ann models 2 3 1 2 flow data this study uses flow hydrograph as an upstream boundary condition in rs60 1 as shown in figure 4 7 years and 3 years of inflow data is used for training and testing of the neural network models respectively this flow hydrograph has each yearly discharge data record of daily discharge information for a period of 200 days the normal depth of 0 0004 is used as a downstream boundary condition at rs36 85 table 4 lists the maximum and minimum range of upstream and t s gate opening boundary condtions 2 3 1 3 sediment data the sediment data required for the study are taken from carriaga and mays 1995 the present study utilizes the ackers white equation thomas ex5 method and toffaleti equation in the hec ras setting for generating the requisite data for the ann models related sediment data used in the study are provided in table 5 2 3 2 description of data used the hydrodynamic sediment model is simulated several times using a combination of different data sets like gate opening height inflow and sediment gradation data the sediment gradation of the riverbed remains unchanged for all simulations each simulation of sediment transport gives one pattern case for the ann model each simulation is carried out with one fixed gate opening height with 200 days of inflow data altogether 7 sets of gate opening height and 10 sets of 200 days of inflow data sets are used in this study resulting in 91 patterns cases out of the 91 patterns so generated 70 patterns are used for training and the remaining 21 patterns for testing from every simulation the bed elevation changes at all the 9 river sections are obtained for a period of 31 days 2 3 3 artificial neural network ann modelling in the present study ann models are developed to estimate aggradation and or degradation i e bed elevation change over space and time along a one dimensional alluvial river as shown in figure 3 in all the ann models the boundary conditions associated with the flow sediment gradation and dam gate opening heights are taken as the inputs while data constituting bed elevation changes over space and time along the river at selected river stations are considered as the targets the present study employs hec ras for generating patterns required for training testing and validation of the ann models as mentioned earlier a total of 91 patterns are generated for training 70 patterns and testing 21 patterns of the proposed ann models it s obvious of course that other sediment transport models like gstars mike cched are equally applicable for performing such studies in developing the proposed ann models all inputs and targets are normalized prior to being fed to the models using the relationship eq 6 as under 6 x n x i x min x max x min where x n normalization x i actual value x max and x min maximum and minimum measurement values there are two stages in back propagation training and testing in the training stage the network is trained with some input and output patterns in order to check the network ability to validate the results with unknown input patterns testing of the network is done after the normalization the input of array size 414 70 is used to train the network with the target of size 819 70 on the other hand the trained models are tested with data of size 819 70 to complete any ann architecture determination of the appropriate number of neurons in the hidden layer is important in the present study the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer is obtained by trial and error approach this study focuses on finding an appropriate ann model that could address the problem in numerical modelling here various ann models are developed by a combination of training algorithms table 2 and transfer functions table 3 the performance of the developed models is estimated with the help of certain statistical parameters 2 4 performance analyses the performance of the neural network can be evaluated by different criteria as there is no accepted standard procedure ghani et al 2011 but a common procedure for the assessment of neural network performance is the use of mean square error mse mean absolute error mae and co efficient of determination r2 for an ann model to be reliable the values of mse and mae should be closer to 0 0 and r2 be closer to 1 the mathematical formulae for mse mae and r2 are given below 1 mean square error mse mse 1 n i 1 n y observed y p r e d i c t e d 2 2 mean absolute error mae mae 1 n i 1 n y observed y p r e d i c t e d 3 co efficient

r e d i c t e d predicted bed elevation change at time t y observed mean of observed bed elevation changes y predicted mean of predicted bed elevation changes n total number of output attributes 3 results in this study 177 different ann models are developed the difference in the models lies in respect of training algorithms and transfer functions used as well as the optimal number of hidden layer neurons obtained through trial and error performances of all such models based on their mse and r2 are detailed in appendix 1 under tables 1 to 14 the numerical value in the ann identifier represents the number of hidden layer neurons used in the model the letters presented before and after the number are the used training algorithm and transfer function respectively the abbreviation of the training algorithms and transfer functions are given in the table 2 and table 3 respectively based on the results presented in appendix 1 tables 1 to 14 the three best performing models against each training algorithm used are selected performance analyses of all the 42 models 3 models from each of 14 training algorithms based on mse mae and r2 are presented in table 6 in order to ensure clarity each model is provided with the same colour code shade the results presented in table 6 clearly show that the performances of more than one ann model are satisfactory such models stretch across different training algorithms and transfer functions in the present study of course the rp9l model is found to be the most reliable with the values of mse and mae equalling 0 0122 and 0 07150 respectively and the value of r2 equalling 0 9763 as can be seen from table 6 performances of many other models are also found to be satisfactory this clearly indicates that there is more than one ann model that can be used for developing sediment transport ann models for alluvial rivers in the present study an attempt is made to rank all such models based on their respective total score table 7 presents these results the performance of rp9l model table 6 for example is found to be the best in respect of mse mae and r2 in other words rp9l secures rank 1 in respect of mse mae and r2 accordingly the total score of rp9l is calculated as 3 1 1 1 3 as such a model with lower total score is considered better as compared to the other with a higher total score such classification of ann models based on scoring is also reported in khatibi et al 2011 a critical look at the details presented in table 7 it can be inferred that as many as four training algorithms viz resilient back propagation bayesian regularization back propagation scaled conjugate gradient back propagation and bfgs quasi newton back propagation outperform others in respect of total scoring comparative plots bed elevation change from hec ras vs respective bed elevation change from ann in respect of these four training algorithms viz rp9l br9t scg13t and bfg10l are presented in figure 5 in all these plots bed elevation changes at all the nine river stations at the end of each day throughout the simulation period of 91 days are considered the final bed elevation changes at the nine river stations for the same ann models are also presented in figure 6 it s worth mentioning that the negative and positive values of bed elevation change represent degradation and aggradation respectively in figure 5 a straight line making an angle of 45 with abscissa is drawn for a perfect ann model all data i e both hec ras simulated and ann estimated bed elevation changes should ideally fall on these lines the plots presented in figure 5 reveal that the data bands around the straight lines are narrow in case of rp9l and br9t ann models while for the other two ann models viz scg13t and bfg10l the bands are wide particularly for lower values of bed elevation changes however as shown in figure 6 for the final bed elevation changes at the respective river stations the performances of all the four ann models are more or less similar 3 1 validation of the methodology with and without target data perturbation the process of transport of sediments in alluvial rivers is influenced by the independent parameters dictating the process for this study the independent parameters are flow gate opening height and sediment gradation any change in the independent variables leads to variation in the output many studies consider either field or experimental data to train and test a neural network model quite often these data comprise of various errors thereby jeopardizing ann model accuracy also sometimes it is difficult to get accurate and complete set of required data sets this study uses hec ras to generate the data sets to train and test the ann models for the developed ann models the bed elevation changes along the river stretch are taken as targets the targets are assumed to be dependent on gate opening height flow and sediment gradation for developing the ann models the data sets i e bed elevation change obtained from hec ras are used as targets in order to assess the model performances with erroneous data sensitivity analyses are also performed in sensitivity analyses the target data sets i e bed elevation change are perturbed by incorporating uniformly distributed errors the percentage of errors considered in this study are 1 5 and 10 results obtained from ann models using unperturbed target data are presented in table 6 ten best performing models obtained using unperturbed data are taken for sensitivity analyses the corresponding ann models are redeveloped using perturbed target data sets such results are presented in table 7 3 1 1 results from sensitivity analyses in table 8 the results of 10 best performing ann models as presented in table 7 with and without perturbed target data sets are presented the performance measures as presented in table 7 are considered as actual these actual values of performance measures are presented along with the corresponding performance measure values obtained using different percentages of errors incorporated in the target data sets the bar diagrams of all such results are also presented in figs 7 9 4 discussion the study primarily focuses on exploring and identifying appropriate neural network models for estimating bed elevation change in an alluvial river the main objective of the study is to assess performances of different ann models using varying training algorithms and transfer functions in sediment transport modelling in this study fourteen different training algorithms including three different transfer functions with an optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer are employed to develop 177 ann models appendix 1 tables 1 to 14 as mentioned in appendix 1 under tables 1 to 14 the performance of the models is analysed using mse and r2 all the models are carefully examined and three models are chosen depending on their performance measure in literature there is no mention of any range of performance measure values to determine the efficiency of an ann model for reliable modelling of sediment transport the values of mse mae and r2 should be closer to 0 0 and 1 respectively in table 6 42 ann models are listed according to their varying performance measure all the reported models have more or less acceptable performance measure values as can be seen in table 6 four ann models have r2 values above 0 9 this indicates a stronger relation of independent variables gate opening height inflow and sediment gradation data with the dependent variables bed elevation change two of these models have a combination of resilient back propagation and log sigmoid transfer function while the other two have bayesian regularization back propagation and hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function it is noticeable from table 6 that scaled conjugate gradient back propagation bfgs quasi newton back propagation conjugate gradient and powell beale restarts back propagation conjugate gradient and polar ribiere updates back propagation with log sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer functions have the ability to produce good results as the numerical simulator as shown in figure 5 the performance of the models can be easily established performance measure values of these models also indicate stronger relationships between the independent and the dependent variables figure 6 presents the performance comparison of hec ras and neural network models to demonstrate the performances of the developed ann models four different training algorithms with two transfer functions are considered in figure 5 and figure 6 in the present study the models with the performance value r2 less than or equal to 0 79 are considered as unsuitable models though it doesn t mean the discarded models are not suitable at all for estimating bed level change a scoring system approach helps in identifying an appropriate number of models based on their performance scores table 7 shows ten suitable models ranked as per their scores this study also shows that four out of fourteen training algorithms and two out of three transfer functions available in matlab nn toolbox outperform other training algorithms and transfer functions but the strength of the discarded training algorithms and transfer functions cannot be neglected which is pointed out in other works reported in literature sensitivity analyses estimate susceptibility of the models to the different percentage of errors incorporated in the target data in the case of mse 21 23 and 31 decrease in model performances are observed with the error of 1 5 and 10 respectively on the other hand the lower value of mae shows that the perturbed models deviate with an average of 13 16 and 20 respctively with respect to above mentioned error inclusion although the perturbed models vary slightly in establishing the relation between the input and the output than the actual ones yet their performances are found to be more or less satisfactory simulation of sediment transport is not an easy task due to unsteady behaviour of the involved processes to replicate such phenomenon with an numerical model detailed sediment data of the entire domain is required in practical cases theavailability of data varying with respect to space and time is tough apart from the sediment data such a numerical model needs parameter values also e g manning s coefficient contraction or expansion coefficient in hec ras to complete the computation these parameters generally have a certain range and have different values for different cases due to lack of correct values of such parameters model performances get hampered the problem of convergence and instability is always associated with numerical models papanicolaou et al 2008 have reviewed the pros and cons of a numerical based computational model tayfur et al 2005 have also compared the performance of the numerical method and artificial neural network as per their studies neural networks can produce results as good as the traditional numerical models which require spatio temporal data the application of neural networks is simple as it can recognise the pattern between the input and target data sets without requiring all the requisite data necessitated in numerical models the approach adopted in this study in respect of generating requisite data sets using hec ras a numerical sediment transport simulator is nothing new peters et al 2006 for example have trained their neural network model in solving flood routing problem using data generated by hec ras but their methodology did not cover testing influence of training algorithms transfer functions as well as other vital parameters of neural network maca et al 2014 have analysed the influence of 12 different transfer functions and 7 training algorithms in flood runoff forecasting they recommended that different transfer functions be tested during training of ann models yonaba et al 2010 have utilised different transfer functions with levenberg marquardt back propagation and bayesian regularization in streamflow forecasting as per the knowledge of the authors no attempt has yet been made to assess the performance of different training algorithms and transfer functions in estimating sediment transport in alluvial rivers using ann in table 1 various studies using a variety of training algorithms and transfer functions in sediment transport modelling using ann are mentioned although none of the studies has explicitly mentioned about suitability of other training algorithms and or transfer functions in solving the problem this present study has at least established suitability of different training algorithms and transfer functions in satisfactorily modelling sediment transport processes in alluvial rivers 5 conclusion in this study the artificial neural network ann is employed for the simulation of sediment transport in an alluvial river different types of training algorithm and transfer function are used to find ann models that are expected to yield reliable results in sediment transport modelling in the present study only three independent variables viz inflow sediment gradation and gate opening height are used as inputs while the bed elevation changes along the river stretch are taken as the targets it s obvious that with these inputs estimation of bed elevation changes is not at all possible when a numerical simulator is intended to be used the main outcome of the study lies in the fact that many ann models with combination of different training algorithms and transfer functions are capable of estimating the bed elevation changes in alluvial rivers even when only three input variables data as cited above are available the study also assessed that even when the target data sets are erroneous the performance of a few ann models is satisfactory one of the limitations of the study is of course that the models are not tested with other input data sets except inflow gate opening height and sediment gradation data declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

5338,statistical downscaling methods have been actively developed to improve the applicability of global climate models gcms outputs to impact studies at a local scale this study presents a multivariate bias correction mbc method that preserves gcm driven climate change signals and the interdependence between hydro climate variables by combining the quantile delta mapping qdm method with distribution free shuffle approach refer to as mbcds since mbcds also employs the gaussian rank correlation directly it does not require an iterative process to improve the gaussianity as used in existing mbc methods this study evaluated the effects of interdependence on univariate and multivariate distribution criteria and hydrologic indicators during a historical baseline period furthermore this study examined potential changes under selected cmip5 climate projections for the three future time windows application of the downscaling outputs to hydrologic simulations showed that the univariate method underestimated snowfall considerably during the snowfall period which leads to less snow accumulation and subsequently resulting in less spring and summer flows on the contrary the multivariate methods improved all of multivariate distribution criteria hydrologic indicators and the ability in reproducing snowfall depending on multiple hydro climate variables i e precipitation and temperature moreover the univariate method projected less increase in winter snowfall compared to those of multivariate methods indicating that the univariate method may result in biased future conditions in particular mbcds showed better and comparative performance compared to the existing methods with regard to climatic and hydrologic performance measures and considerably improved the computational time with up to 53 less computing time required than those of other existing methods which include an iterative process therefore this study proved that mbcds can be a good alternative to provide high resolution climate projections for impact studies at local scales further the study also demonstrated that consideration of the interdependence between hydro climate variables using multivariate methods is essential to avoid erroneous assessment of climate change impacts for snow dominated watersheds such as those in alberta canada keywords statistical downscaling multivariate bias correction hydrologic simulation alberta 1 introduction a long term plan for addressing climate change impacts on terrestrial and ecological systems needs climate projections derived from global

2013 watterson 2019 as the impacts of climate change are more critical at local scales a requirement has been growing to assess local impacts of climate change on hydrological and ecological systems by stakeholders in communities coppola et al 2018 eum et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 however direct application of gcms outputs at a local scale has been impeded by the fact that gcms are usually not capable of capturing climate variability at a local scale mainly due to coarse grid resolutions fowler et al 2007 e g 100 km on average in the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 taylor et al 2012 a remarkable advance has been made to produce higher resolution and more precise projections from gcms miyamoto et al 2013 prein et al 2015 putman and suarez 2011 however climate change studies have still suffered from the considerable systematic biases remaining in gcms outputs eum et al 2012 stevens and bony 2013 therefore downscaling and bias correction procedures are increasingly becoming a prerequisite for impact studies at local or site specific scales bennett et al 2012 christensen and lettenmaier 2007 eum et al 2014 wood et al 2004 downscaling techniques nested by gcms over a specific region have been developed to produce a higher resolution climate dataset by dynamical and statistical downscaling models alder and hostetler 2019 bürger et al 2013 gutmann et al 2014 leung et al 2004 poan et al 2018 the dynamical downscaling methods primarily rely on physical process descriptions of atmospheric phenomena by regional climate models rcms which require highly skilled experts and a high computational cost to run rcms and store their outputs however many studies have found that systematic errors still remain in rcms outputs mearns et al 2012 sillmann et al 2013 in contrast statistical downscaling methods are a cost and time efficient way to produce high resolution climate data by employing the relationships between observations and outputs of climate models to downscale and remove systematic errors in climate models outputs abatzoglou and brown 2012 eum et al 2016a wood and lettenmaier 2006 statistical downscaling methods are usually comprised of spatial disaggregation and bias correction spatial disaggregation mostly employs a simple interpolation technique eum and cannon 2017 or climate analogs abatzoglou and brown 2012 hidalgo et al 2008 hwang and graham 2013 to reproduce the small scale climate variability of observations a more crucial process in statistical downscaling is the bias correction that involves building a relationship between observed data and climate models output using either perfect prognosis pp or model output statistics mos pp is an approach that develops a statistical relationship between observed atmospheric parameters e g humidity solar radiation evaporation etc and target variables e g precipitation and temperature for application with the same atmospheric variables from the climate models to generate the corresponding target variables since a critical drawback of the pp approach is that it assumes perfect projections however it may provide a significantly biased or meaningless output if the projected parameters have a considerable bias shafer and fuelberg 2008 on the contrary mos directly formulates a transfer function of target variables between observation and simulation from a climate model therefore mos has a primary advantage that model biases and local climatology are intrinsically included in the transfer function in this regard mos based methods as an asynchronous approach have been actively applied for adjusting distributional statistics bürger et al 2009 cannon et al 2015 eum et al 2016a li et al 2010 maurer et al 2010 shukla et al 2014 many studies have employed a non parametric approach i e quantile mapping qm to bias correct climate models outputs maurer et al 2010 wood et al 2004 as prior studies have shown that non parametric approaches provide better performance on removing systematic biases of climate models gudmundsson et al 2012 the applications of qm have been advanced to avoid substantial distortions of model driven climate signals especially in extremes induced by qm bürger et al 2013 cannon 2015 li et al 2010 maraun 2013 maurer and pierce 2014 pierce et al 2015 however since qm is typically applied for individual target variables independently i e as a univariate method it simply reproduces the inter variable dependence structure derived from climate models in other words the univariate method cannot improve the interdependence between hydro climate variables when a systematic bias in the inter variable dependence structure exists in hydrologic impact studies the inaccurate interdependence of target variables e g precipitation and temperature may lead to inaccurate climate change impacts chen et al 2018 in particular the interdependence between precipitation and temperature is crucial in cold regions as the phase of precipitation i e rain snow or mixed phase depends on the interdependence harpold et al 2017 kienzle 2008 the presence of snow affects surface energy and water balance in hydrologic models with snow related processes such as snow accumulation sublimation and melting andreadis et al 2009 meyer et al 2019 therefore the interdependence bias of climate model outputs may cause misrepresentation of precipitation phase resulting in biased streamflow in the amount and timing of snow melting minimum and maximum flow and spring freshet bosshard et al 2014 eum et al 2017 harder and pomeroy 2014 mizukami et al 2013 this is especially problematic when the biased climate dataset is forced into hydrologic models as the bias in the interdependence can be adjusted on the observed streamflow by calibrating parameters resulting in spurious responses shamir and georgakakos 2006 to overcome the limitation of the univariate methods multivariate bias correction algorithms have been introduced to take into account the multivariate dependence structure bürger et al 2011 cannon 2016 2018 li et al 2014 piani and haerter 2012 vrac and friederichs 2015 while most of the developed multivariate bias correction mbc approaches remove systematic biases to reproduce a specific measure of the interdependence structure cannon 2016 such as pearson correlation mbcp and spearman rank correlation mbcr a multivariate bias correction method with the n dimensional probability density function transform mbcn suggested by cannon 2018 transfers all aspects of an observed multivariate distribution to the corresponding multivariate distribution of climate models however many multivariate techniques include an iterative process that requires a higher computational time and may also cause a convergence issue cannon 2018 to mitigate some of these problems guo et al 2019 proposed a two stage quantile mapping tsqm method employing a univariate quantile mapping method chen et al 2013 and subsequently a distribution free shuffle approach iman and conover 1982 as tsqm directly uses the gaussian rank correlation there is no need for an iterative process anymore for precipitation however the sequence of a climate model output is considerably reordered by a local intensity scaling schmidli et al 2006 which corrects the bias in wet day frequency under a strong assumption of stationarity in the wet day frequency the correction of time sequencing may cause not only the modification of spatial and temporal correlations but also inconsistency in climate forcing of physics based climate models which is a statistical artifact of the bias correction cannon 2016 maraun 2016 meyer et al 2019 as an alternative solution this study suggests a multivariate bias correction combined with the distribution free shuffle approach mbcds to 1 preserve gcm driven long term trends and time sequencing of climate models 2 reduce computational time by removing the iterative process in the algorithm and 3 preserve the interdependence of hydro climate variables in applying the suggested mbcds approach in this study firstly a quantile delta mapping qdm is applied to bias correct individual hydro climate variables separately as a univariate method for preserving model driven relative changes in all quantiles cannon et al 2015 then the bias corrected values are again corrected using the gaussian rank correlation of the observed data transformed to van der waerden scores to preserve the inter variable dependence structure in this procedure the empirical copula bias correction ec bc suggested by vrac and friederichs 2015 is implemented to restore multi dimensional copula based on the rank ordering derived from the distribution free shuffle approach further this study also inter compared the performance of mbcds to other existing multiple multivariate methods mbcn and mbcp and a univariate method qdm which has actively been applied in literature for climate and impact studies the comparison includes performance with respect to univariate and multivariate distribution criteria and hydrologic indicators simulated by a process based hydrologic model and the effects of the interdependence on climate projections 2 climate data 2 1 historical dataset a long term and reliable observed climate dataset with sufficient spatial and temporal coverage for a target region is a key factor to successfully apply a statistical downscaling technique this is because a downscaled dataset the final product of statistical downscaling corresponds to the characteristics of the observations e g marginal distribution and resolution both spatial and temporal a number of high resolution gridded climate datasets have been produced from station based hutchinson et al 2009 shen et al 2001 werner et al 2019 multiple source based lespinas et al 2015 and reanalysis mesinger et al 2006 datasets to provide consistent and long term climate information for a region however the challenge is how to systematically select the most suitable climate dataset for a large scale study domain amongst the available historical gridded climate datasets that are not consistent in terms of their spatial domain resolution number of hydro climate variables and data length eum and gupta 2019 suggested a reference reliability evaluation system refres to systematically rank multiple historical climate datasets based on performance metrics and generate a hybrid climate dataset from the multiple climate datasets available in a repository for a study domain the hybrid climate dataset provides daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperature from 1950 to 2016 at 10 km resolution over the alberta province canada this study employed this hybrid climate dataset as an observed climate dataset for statistical downscaling of gcms projections over the region 2 2 climate projections over the last decades the coupled model intercomparison project cmip has provided multiple climate models outputs to better understand past and future climate conditions focusing on climate model diagnosis validation and inter comparison meehl et al 2005 involving twenty climate modeling groups in the world the 5th phase of cmip cmip5 provided a new set of coordinated climate model experiments to evaluate mechanisms related to the cycle of greenhouse gases predictability and the variability of climate models responses taylor et al 2012 cmip5 produced both decadal meehl et al 2009 and multi decadal climate experiments under four specified representative concentration pathways rcp i e rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 in which the rcp suffixes represent estimates of the radiative forcing w m2 in the year of 2100 thomson et al 2011 taylor et al 2012 van vuuren et al 2011 as rcp8 5 represents business as usual scenarios that produce the highest emission and radiative forcings many studies employed the rcp8 5 climate scenarios as extreme projections to assess climate change impacts on hydrologic regimes eum et al 2017 flooding hoang et al 2016 sediment transport regime dibike et al 2018 ecosystem du et al 2019 this study also selected the rcp8 5 climate projections which have been previously downscaled by univariate and multivariate methods to investigate climate change impacts in alberta although intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc recommended a model democracy approach that uses all available gcms projections to fully consider the uncertainty in climate change scenarios church et al 2013 it is not practical to include all gcms scenarios in climate change impact studies because of the huge computational cost incurred for running impact models to evaluate their responses to all of climate forcing scenarios instead of employing all gcms output a subset of the gcms pool has been suggested for impact studies giorgi and mearns 2002 lutz et al 2016 recently farjad et al 2019 have categorized all of the cited methods for the gcm scenarios selection into four methods 1 hindcasting approach eum et al 2014 giorgi and mearns 2002 lutz et al 2016 2 clustering approach houle et al 2012 3 envelop approach cannon 2015 farjad et al 2019 and 4 hybrid method mcsweeney et al 2015 among them cannon 2015 suggested twelve representative gcm scenarios for western north america to fully capture climate variability in expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi zhang et al 2011 therefore this study also employed the five gcm scenarios suggested by cannon 2015 as shown in table 1 to comprehensively evaluate the skills of the univariate and multiple downscaling methods during a baseline period from 1976 to 2005 in addition this study investigated climate change impacts in alberta based on the selected five gcm scenarios the climate projections were divided into the three 30 year future time windows i e 2006 2035 2020 s 2036 2065 2050 s 2066 2095 2080 s 3 methodology 3 1 univariate downscaling method many mos based methods usually incorporate quantile mapping qm to bias correct gcms outputs e g bias correction spatial disaggregation bcsd wood et al 2004 bias correction constructed analogue bcca hidalgo et al 2008 multivariate adaptive constructed analogs maca abatzoglou and brown 2012 and bias correction stochastic analog bcsa hwang and graham 2013 by extrapolating values lying outside of a historical data range however substantial distortions of model driven climate change signals have been detected for climate variables with a strong long term trend particularly more in extreme values maraun 2013 maurer and pierce 2014 pierce et al 2015 many alternatives have been developed to preserve the long term trend of climate variables piani et al 2010 hempel et al 2013 bürger et al 2013 however they have a limitation that it does not guarantee to preserve the long term trend in extremes cannon et al 2015 suggested the quantile delta mapping qdm approach that is designed to preserve gcm driven relative changes in all quantiles based on the qm technique eum and cannon 2017 applied spatial disaggregation quantile delta mapping sdqdm for precipitation and temperature and demonstrated that sdqdm preserves the long term trend well in etccdi indices sdqdm was applied as a univariate method to be compared with multivariate methods in this study sdqdm firstly conducts the spatial disaggregation to targeted grid cells by the inverse distance squared weighted interpolation and the transfer functions of qdm are given by 1 δ m t x m f t f m c 1 f m f t x m f t f o r t e m p e r a t u r e x m f t f m c 1 f m f t x m f t f o r p r e c i p i t a t i o n 2 x m f t f o c 1 f m f x m f t δ m t f o r t e m p e r a t u r e f o c 1 f m f x m f t δ m t f o r p r e c i p i t a t i o n where δ m t is an absolute change or relative ratio for precipitation in a quantile between current and future periods at time t x m f t and x m f t are raw and bias corrected data from a climate model at time t during a future period fo c is empirical cumulative density function cdf of observed data fm c and fm f are the cdfs of modeled data for current and future periods respectively sdqdm bias corrects to match the marginal distribution properties of the observed data for a given climate variable separately 3 2 multivariate downscaling methods 3 2 1 existing multivariate methods to preserve the multivariate dependence structure multivariate bias correction mbc algorithms have been introduced in climate change studies bürger et al 2011 cannon 2016 li et al 2014 vrac and friederichs 2015 most of these algorithms rescale variables to employ anomalies assuming that the covariance of the observed anomalies is positive definite to decomposite covariance of observed data by the cholesky decomposition then the climate model anomalies are corrected by the upper triangular matrix of the observed data a product of the cholesky decomposition for preserving inter variable dependence of the observed data bürger et al 2011 cannon 2016 suggested an iterative algorithm to improve the observed correlation structure due to the absence of multivariate gaussianity in the algorithm this study applied mbc suggested by cannon 2016 to preserve pearson correlation called mbcp as an alternative of multivariate methods mbcp is designed to preserve the multivariate dependence structure by only taking the pearson correlation into account cannon 2016 in addition the iterative process in mbcp is introduced until convergence conditions measured by mean absolute error mae of correlation matrices are reached however a critical issue can be raised by the fact that the convergence is not theoretically proved in most cases cannon 2018 thus suggested a new multivariate bias correction method combined with the n dimensional probability density function transform mbcn which has been originally designed to transfer color information from a source image to another to match the impression of the source image pitié et al 2005 mbcn applies firstly qdm for climate data rotated by a random orthogonal rotation and takes the inverse rotation matrix to obtain bias corrected climate data this procedure is iterated until convergence to the multivariate distribution of observation is reached being measured by the energy distance d székely and rizzo 2004 mbcn has been proved for convergence and there is no limitation on the shape of probability density function pitié et al 2005 2007 more details on the algorithms of mbcp and mbcn are found in cannon 2016 and cannon 2018 respectively 3 2 2 multivariate bias correction with distribution free shuffle method mbcds although the iterative process in mbcn and mbcp brings added values to bias corrected climate data in reproducing the inter variable dependence structure of observed data a computational burden induced by the iterative process is inevitable for impacts studies that usually require multiple gcms projections to take into account uncertainty in climate projections guo et al 2019 suggested a two stage quantile mapping tsqm method that is comprised of a univariate daily bias correction method dbc chen et al 2013 and a distribution free shuffle approach iman and conover 1982 however tsqm substantially modifies gcm driven daily sequence of precipitation events to correct the wet day frequency of precipitation as local intensity scaling in tsqm has been originally developed to temporally downscale from annual to daily time scale this study suggests a new mbcds method that combines multivariate bias correction with the distribution free shuffle approach that preserves the marginal distributions and the gaussian rank correlation of observed data fig 1 shows a flow diagram for the mbcds procedures that consist of the following four steps 1 given an observed data x o corresponding to current and future climate model data x c and x f apply qdm for individual hydro climate variables as a univariate quantile mapping to yield bias corrected values of x c and x f 2 calculate the van der waerden scores by φ 1 i n 1 where φ 1 is the inverse function of the standard normal distribution i is the element rank of each climate variable and n is a sample size denote the van der waerden scores for x o x c and x f by w o w c and w f respectively 3 decompose the covariance matrix of w o w c and w f by cholesky decomposition to obtain the upper triangular matrix u o u c and u f and calculate the new score matrices by 3 w c w c u c 1 u o 4 w f w f u f 1 u o 4 elements of x c and x f are ordered according to the ordinal ranks of the corresponding elements of w c and w f with regard to maintaining the rank dependence structure and fitting to the marginal distribution of the observed data by qdm mbcds has a similar process to that of mbcr however mbcr first calculates anomalies of observed and modeled data and decomposes the covariance matrix estimated by spearman rank correlation as multivariate gaussianity is not proved in the algorithm of mbcr an iterative process is introduced into mbcr to improve the multivariate gaussianity in contrast mbcds calculates the gaussian rank correlation of transformed matrices by the van der waerden scores which is a robust and consistent measure of interdependence structure at the normal model nordhausen and taskinen 2015 therefore a more accurate estimate of the covariance can be obtained which in turn improves reproducing the inter variable dependence structure in addition removing the iterative process also improves computational efficiency when multivariate approaches are applied to multiple climate models over several decadal periods therefore the main advantages of mbcds are 1 the temporal sequence of climate model data can be largely maintained at least avoiding a substantial modification of the original sequence 2 the model driven long term trend can be preserved by qdm 3 the inter variable dependence structure can be preserved and 4 there is no need of an iterative process resulting in computational efficiency as climate model outputs are based on physical processes in the atmosphere ocean and land under feasible emission scenarios stationarity assumption of the frequency of climate events in tsqm may mislead the subsequent climate change impact assessments especially the sequence of extreme climate events in climate change scenarios is very crucial in hydrologic models to evaluate climate change impacts on hydrologic regimes therefore including tsqm where the sequencing of extreme climate events might be substantially altered with other downscaling methods may not allow a fair comparison of the performance of various downscaling methods in hydrologic responses consequently tsqm reconstructing the original sequence of climate model was excluded from the inter comparison of this study to validate the usefulness of multivariate methods the baseline period 1976 2005 was divided into two parts 1976 1990 and 1991 2005 to be used for calibration and validation in turn in other words the one period was used as the calibration period and then downscaled data for each of the five gcm scenarios table 1 were produced for the other period by the applied univariate and multivariate methods in this way the 30 year 1976 to 2005 downscaled data were produced and used to evaluate the skill of univariate and multivariate downscaling methods in summary mbcds mbcn mbcp and qdm were applied in this study to downscale three hydro climate variables i e precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature for the selected five gcms output and to evaluate their performance in various indicators 3 3 performance measures 3 3 1 criteria for univariate and multivariate distribution since the last two decades climate communities focused on understanding the impacts of changes in extreme events with regard to their frequency and severity the expert team in world meteorological organization wmo has coordinated an international effort to develop a suite of indices derived from daily data focusing primarily on extreme climate events peterson 2005 as a consequence of this international effort a set of extreme indices called expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi zhang et al 2011 which are related to daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperature have been developed as the etccdi indices are based on two important hydro climate variables a set of twenty six etccdi indices shown in table 2 were selected as performance criteria to evaluate the performance of univariate distribution using the downscaled climate data during the baseline period in the province of alberta canada as criteria for multivariate distribution various performance measures were used to evaluate the skill of statistical downscaling methods investigated in this study firstly the convergence measures used in mbcn and mbcp were directly employed followed by energy distance d and mean absolute error mae of correlation matrices as described in eq 5 and eq 6 respectively 5 d 2 f g 2 e x y e x y e y y 0 6 m a e 2 k k 1 i 1 k 1 j i 1 k c o r x i j c o r y i j where f and g are multivariate cumulative density functions cdfs for independent random vectors x and y e is the expected value â is the euclidean norm and k is the number of variables the target multivariate structures cdf and correlation of independent random vectors x and y are identical when d and mae are zero in addition to d and mae measures snowfall and potential evapotranspiration estimates which depends on both precipitation and temperature were used as other criteria for multivariate distribution for instance the shift from rain to snow or vice versa on a wet day depends on air temperature a static threshold method eq 7 used in the canadian ubc watershed model pipes and quick 1977 was employed to separate rain and snow in precipitation data a modified hargreaves method droogers and allen 2002 hargreaves 1994 in eq 8 was also used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration pet t ave 0 6 snow for all precipitation 0 6 t ave 3 6 rain proportion t ave 3 0 2 7 t ave 3 6 rain for all precipitation 8 p e t 0 0013 0408 r a t ave 17 0 d tr 0 0123 p 0 76 where tave is daily average temperature calculated by tmin tmax 2 ra is extraterrestrial radiation determined by latitude and date allen et al 1998 dtr is the daily temperature range between tmin and tmax and p is precipitation in mm month eq 7 and 8 were applied to estimate daily snowfall and potential evapotranspiration at 10 km grid resolution based on the observed i e the hybrid climate dataset and downscaled climate datasets 3 3 2 criteria for hydrologic processes hydrologic processes in cold regions are considerably affected by the interdependence of hydro climate variables over predict rain induced by a statistical downscaling method for instance may lead to expediting the processes in infiltration snowmelt and surface runoff in a cold region affecting magnitude and timing of extreme and seasonal streamflows bosshard et al 2014 harpold et al 2017 jepsen et al 2016 therefore biases in the interdependence between precipitation and temperature may cause unexpected biases in hydrologic processes in snow accumulation and melting evapotranspiration and runoff chen et al 2018 the nature conservancy introduced various hydrologic indicators indicators of hydrologic alteration iha to assess the human impacts on hydrologic processes the nature conservancy 2009 monk et al 2011 peters et al 2012 iha mainly quantifies magnitude timing duration frequency and change rate of hydrologic regimes shrestha et al 2014 and eum et al 2016 adapted ihas along with other water resources indicators wri to assess the characteristics of observed flow and climate change impacts further monk et al 2012 introduced key additional indicators for cold regions e g spring freshet and spring ice breakup among wris ihas and the cold region indicators eum et al 2017 selected 6 wris 4 ihas and 2 cold region indicators to evaluate climate change impacts on hydrologic regimes in the athabasca river basin as the work in eum et al 2017 this study also adapted the same hydrologic indicators except for the center of timing of annual flow that is mainly affected by spring freshet in other words 11 hydrologic indicators 5 wris 4 ihas and 2 cold region indicators as shown in table 3 were used to evaluate the skill of statistical downscaling methods used in this study the annual spring freshet initiation date and magnitude were considered as cold region indicators in table 3 spring freshet initiation is defined as when daily mean flow exceeds 1 5 times that of preceding 16 days averaged flow abdul aziz and burn 2006 this study forced the downscaled climate datasets into a process based hydrologic model called the variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1994 1996 model which has notable strength in modelling hydrologic processes in cold regions such as frozen soil limited thaw depths or where snow accumulation ablation and melting processes are common cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 cherkauer et al 2003 eum and gupta 2019 have refined a previously developed vic model eum et al 2017 for a finer spatial resolution 1 32 and demonstrated that the recently developed hybrid climate dataset provides better hydrologic simulations for the athabasca river basin arb employing the hybrid climate dataset the vic model was calibrated using observed hydrologic data at six hydrometric stations located in the upper catchment area of arb refer to fig 2 and table 4 calibration and validation periods were determined depending on the record length of each hydrometric station table 5 shows the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse at the selected five hydrometric stations the result shows that all of the nse values in calibration and validation periods are above 0 50 which is a threshold of satisfactory performance in hydrologic models moriasi et al 2007 indicating that the calibrated vic model can provide reliable hydrologic simulations the calibrated vic model was run to simulate hydrologic responses to the hybrid i e observation and downscaled climate datasets during the baseline period from 1976 to 2005 and their performance was compared using the selected 11 hydrologic indicators table 3 at the selected six hydrometric stations in the arb 4 results 4 1 performance in univariate criteria each of the five selected gcms table 1 was downscaled by mbcn mbcds mbcp and qdm separately and the extreme climate indices etccdis were calculated at each grid cell total 9 365 cells within the alberta border subsequently an ensemble mean value was calculated for each climate index from the five gcms fig 3 shows box whisker plots of selected etccdi ensemble mean values spatially averaged over alberta during the baseline period from 1976 to 2005 among twenty six etccdis nine indicators were presented in fig 3 to concisely provide a set of results the results show that each of the four downscaling methods removed the biases in the raw gcm data reasonably well annual maximum temperature values e g tnx and txx were generally underestimated by all downscaling methods while annual minimum temperatures e g tnn and txn were overestimated although the relative magnitude varied with the downscaling methods such results are mainly caused by the cold and warm bias of gcms in extreme hot and cold temperature respectively the biases in indicators related to consecutive extreme hot wsdi and cold csdi events were not improved considerably by the downscaling methods indicating that all methods maintain the original sequence of the gcms for precipitation related indicators i e prcptot and r95tot qdm performed even better than mbcn and was very comparative to mbcds and mbcp in the consecutive wet day indicator cwd gcm raw showed considerable bias due to the drizzle effect of climate models but it was corrected well by the downscaling methods fig 4 presents the spatial patterns of the selected extreme climate indices during the baseline period over alberta while obs plot in fig 4 shows calculated etccdi values corresponding to the observed data the raw gcm and downscaled gcm plots i e gcm raw mbcn mbcds mbcp and qdm shows the difference in calculated etccdi values between observation and the raw gcm as well as those downscaled by each of the four downscaling methods in each case the desired value is a difference of zero presented by green color in the maps as in fig 3 fig 4 also shows that the downscaled gcm outputs underestimated txx for most part of the province while overestimating tnn in the southern region for prcptot and r95ptot mbcn underestimated relatively more and other methods showed the same pattern that underestimates at the southwestern high elevation region overall the performance of the univariate qdm downscaling method is quite comparable to those of multivariate methods with respect to the univariate criteria 4 2 performance in multivariate criteria the performance of raw and downscaled gcm outputs with multivariate criteria was measured by the energy distance d and mean absolute error mae of correlation matrices table 6 shows seasonal energy distance and mae averaged over the 9 365 grid cells within alberta the four seasons are defined as spring from march to may mam summer from june to august jja autumn from september to november son and winter from december to february djf as expected the raw gcm output performed poorly in both the energy distance and mae mbcn performed the best in the energy distance as its algorithm incorporates the energy distance directly into the iterative process to confirm convergence to the multivariate distribution of the observed data mbcds performed comparative to mbcn and better than mbcp and qdm in both criteria it is notable that mbcds performed better than mbcp that incorporates mae into the iterative process at the same time table 7 shows the computational time required to statistically downscale a one year inm cm4 climate model output for alberta by each of the univariate and multivariate methods investigated in this study mbcds needed only 1 08 h the least cpu time while mbcn required 2 30 h to complete downscaling the one year climate dataset although qdm does not have an iterative process it also required slightly longer computational time 1 34 h than mbcds as it downscales each hydro climate variable separately these results indicate that mbcds can preserve the multivariate interdependence comparable to mbcn and better than mbcp and qdm while considerably improving the computational burden it is also notable that the seasonal maes of qdm were similar to those of the raw gcm output while qdm improved the energy distance that measures the similarity of multivariate distribution these results imply that qdm can only correct the marginal distribution to the observed data and simply reproduce the original interdependence of climate model outputs in addition to the energy distance and mae the potential evapotranspiration pet and snowfall estimates were used to measure the performance of all downscaling methods fig 5 shows monthly estimates of potential evapotranspiration pet and snowfall spatially averaged over the alberta province the raw gcm underestimated pet while overestimating snowfall from october to april compared to observed climate data obs there is no noticeable difference between the univariate and multivariate methods in reproducing pet computed from observed data the raw gcm highly overestimated snowfall during the snow cover period from october to april conversely qdm underestimated snowfall during the period from november to may which may affect snow accumulation during the snow cover period and then the magnitude of snow melting spring freshet and runoff during spring and summer seasons accordingly the effects of the interdependence were more obvious in snowfall estimates that the multivariate methods showed better agreement with that of the observation than the univariate method fig 6 also illustrates the difference in pet and snow for summer jja and winter djf respectively between the univariate and multivariate methods the pet computed from observed climate showed a spatial pattern with relatively higher values in southern alberta and lower values in the high elevation mountainous area while qdm mostly overestimated pet in the whole alberta the multivariate methods showed better agreement with that of the observed pet the observation of snow also showed a spatial pattern that is higher snow in high elevation regions due to the orographic effect on precipitation and the lapse rate of temperature the effect of multivariate methods is illustrated much more prominently in snow indicating that preserving the interdependence between precipitation and temperature by the multivariate methods is crucial to accurately reproduce snow and subsequent snow related processes 4 3 effects of the interdependence on hydrologic indicators the effect of interdependence in climate variables was assessed based on the outputs of the vic hydrologic simulations over the target region in the athabasca river basin see fig 1 for the baseline period from 1976 to 2005 the vic hydrologic model was forced by hydro climate variables of each of the five gcm outputs statistically downscaled by the univariate and multivariate methods i e mbcn mbcds mbcp and qdm fig 7 shows the monthly mean swe averaged over the target basin once again qdm underestimated swe during the snow cover period from november to april and especially larger differences compared to the observation from january to march when the annual maximum swe usually occurs on the contrary all of the multivariate methods showed good agreement with the observation fig 8 also shows the average rate of snow melting during the spring season mam for the baseline period qdm and mbcn underestimated spring snow melting at the headwater region because qdm under predicted the proportion of snow hence less swe during the winter season while mbcn over predicted the proportion of snow but less snow melting during the spring season see fig 7 in contrast mbcds and mbcp showed good agreement with relatively smaller difference in spring snowmelt from that simulated with observed climate data the performance of the different statistical downscaling techniques was also examined in terms of their ability to replicate the selected hydrologic indicators at each of the hydrometric stations within the target basin and presented in fig 9 the red line represents the median value of the indicators derived from outputs of the vic hydrologic model forced by the observed climate data for the stations located at the high elevation headwater region i e hinton and windfall climatic drivers from mbcn and qdm produced less snow melting and swe respectively both resulting in less spring mam flow qdm overestimated rain proportion in winter precipitation causing more winter djf and less summer jja flows due to less snow accumulation swe during the snow cover period mbcds and mbcp simulated freshet date and magnitude close to the observation at hinton mainly as a result of more accurate swe and snow melting simulations for the magnitude and timing of minimum and maximum flow all methods performed similarly to each other however in case of qdm maximum flows at hinton occurred earlier than other methods due to the over prediction of rain during the snow cover period similar results in the hydrologic indicators were shown for the hydrometric stations located at the tributaries i e pembina south heart and swan stations unlike at the headwater region i e hinton and windfall however it is prominent that the minimum flows by qdm at the tributaries and athabasca stations were higher than other methods because of more winter flow from rain it is also noteworthy that the spring and summer flows at athabasca station in fig 9 f under qdm were lower than those of headwater stations and were compensated by over simulated spring flows from the tributaries similar to the headwater and tributary stations winter flow by qdm was higher than observed due to the rain over prediction during the winter season djf overall qdm the univariate method over predicted winter flows and under predicted spring and summer flows due to the over predicted rain during the snow cover period which was detected distinctly at the headwater region on the other hand the multivariate methods reproduced winter and spring flows relatively better especially larger improvements were made at the headwater region more affected by snow dominated hydrologic processes 4 4 effects of the interdependence on future projections potential changes in climatic and hydrologic conditions were investigated for the three future time windows i e 2020 s 2050 s and 2080 s under rcp8 5 especially changes in pet and snowfall that are calculated by eq 7 and 8 respectively as multivariate criteria in this study fig 10 illustrates the effects of interdependence between climatic variables on snowfall projections as expected qdm univariate method induced lower snowfall during both the baseline and future periods especially in march and april compared to multivariate methods interestingly an increase in snowfall during the winter season from december to february was projected by all methods especially under far future period 2080 s while a decrease in snowfall amounts was projected during the spring and fall seasons these results indicate more precipitation under snow driving temperature below 0 conditions during the winter season are projected leading to an increase in snowfall while the more frequent rain driving mild temperature and or less precipitation are projected during the spring season as evident in fig 11 while all downscaling methods univariate and multivariate project a declining trend in annual snowfall the decline rate projected by qdm is much higher than those by the multivariate methods further mbcp projected the highest amount of annual snowfall over the period amongst all of the univariate and multivariate methods the projected snowfall by mbcds showed similar patterns in annual variability and trend to that by mbcn it is worthwhile to note that despite the projected increase in snowfall during the winter season as shown in fig 10 all the univariate and multivariate methods projected a downward trends in annual snowfall indicating that the projected decrease in snowfall during the spring and fall seasons is much larger than the increase during the winter season fig 12 presents summer pet for the baseline period and the difference of pet between the baseline hist and three future time windows for the univariate and multivariate methods these plots clearly show that summer pet is expected to increase throughout the province of alberta with a relatively larger increase in 2080 s in the southern part of the province where higher pet usually occurs historically such increase in pet may cause soil moisture deficits in future resulting in more extreme drought conditions in alberta interestingly both univariate and multivariate methods are in good agreement in showing the spatial patterns in pet change for all the future time windows similarly fig 13 presents the spatial pattern of changes in winter snowfall over alberta indicating the projected increase in most parts of the province which is consistent with the results shown in fig 10 with an exception in some parts of southern and western regions where a decrease in snowfall is projected further all downscaling methods projected a larger increase in snowfall over the high elevation mountainous region bordering the province of british columbia indicating that extreme winter snowfall events may occur more frequently in the future as expected qdm relatively underestimated the change in projected snowfall during winter compared to the multivariate methods as snow is a crucial component for seasonal water availability in snow dominated watersheds such a systematic bias induced by a downscaling method e g univariate method may have a potential to significantly influence or cause biases in hydrologic projections such as a relatively faster decline in snow and glacier volumes snowmelt and subsequent seasonal flows over time 5 discussion whether considering the interdependence between climate variables may bring added values in impact studies is still a debatable subject for instance some researches have assessed the effects of interdependence on fire risk indicators but found a marginal improvement yang et al 2015 casanueva et al 2018 räty et al 2018 also indicated that it is difficult to demonstrate that multivariate methods may significantly reduce biases in hydrologic indicators on the contrary the effects of multivariate methods have been clearly identified with the canadian fire weather index cannon 2018 heat stress fire risk indicators zscheischler et al 2019 and snowmelt driven streamflow meyer et al 2019 furthermore they concluded that substantial improvements by multivariate methods can be found when 1 the climate models have considerable biases in the interdependence 2 selected impact indicators are highly dependent on multiple variables and 3 the applied model is capable of capturing the impact of interdependence between variables zscheischler et al 2019 this study also investigated the effects of interdependence between hydro climate variables on multiple univariate and multivariate distribution criteria the results showed that there is little difference between univariate and multivariate methods for the univariate criteria i e etccdi and pet where the interdependence between variables is not a factor and can be ignored however the multivariate methods performed better in reducing biases in the multivariate distribution criteria and hydrologic indicators where the interdependence of multiple variables is an important factor there was little improvement in the case of etccdis and pet because etccdis are not depending on multiple variables i e based on a single climate variable and the pet used in this study was calculated primarily from minimum and maximum temperature that usually have high interdependence which is accurately simulated by gcms this study also demonstrated the pronounced effects of the multivariate methods on multivariate distribution criteria such as snowfall and snow related hydrologic indicators e g swe spring and winter flows and spring freshet in general the effects of a multivariate method can be significant for those indicators strongly affected by multiple climate variables e g snow related indices déry et al 2005 eum et al 2016b energy supply indices sterl et al 2018 and arid index woli et al 2012 this study also showed that as the multivariate methods adjust the bias in the interdependence between precipitation and temperature more precipitation at snow inducing temperatures were produced by the multivariate methods compared to those of the univariate method qdm resulting in higher amounts of snowfall and swe mbcds performed better than mbcp and qdm and was comparable to mbcn for the multivariate distribution criteria as shown in table 6 based on the cross validation of this study however mbcn underestimated snow melting at the headwater mountainous region during the spring season fig 8 indicating colder temperature on dry days and subsequently overestimated swe fig 7 on the contrary mbcds showed good agreement with the observation driven hydrologic simulation obs the impacts of climate change for snow dominated watersheds has been investigated as a change of snowfall that may induce a change in the amounts of snow cover and a shift of snowmelt and spring freshet timing bennett et al 2012 coppola et al 2018 eum et al 2017 therefore the biases in the interdependence between precipitation and temperature may lead to erroneous assessments of climate change impacts and subsequently inappropriate adaptations and mitigation strategies furthermore mbcds simplified the procedures by incorporating the gaussian rank correlation instead of an iterative algorithm and consequently reduced the computational time considerably table 7 since climate change impacts assessments require employing as many of multiple climate scenarios as possible to incorporate uncertainty in climate change signals and their potential effects on climate sensitive systems availability of computationally efficient downscaling methods and domain specific impact assessment models becomes crucial to complete such studies in a timely manner the suggested computationally efficient mbcds multivariate downscaling method is a good alternative to provide high resolution climate projections for regions where the interdependence between hydro climate variables play an important role in hydrologic processes the assumption of stationarity in statistical downscaling methods is another fundamental issue where there is no consensus between scientific communities fowler et al 2007 maraun et al 2010 wang et al 2018 besides the assumption of stationarity in marginal distributions for qdm a univariate method applied in this study the multivariate methods also assumed stationarity in inter variable dependence structure preserving the interdependence of observation between climate variables over a projection period contrary to the original ec bc method that preserves the rank of references vrac and friederichs 2015 the sequences of climate projections for the multivariate methods investigated in this study i e mbcp mbcn and mbcds were reordered by the ordinal ranks of new matrices eq 3 and eq 4 resulting in evolving interdependence over time however it is necessary to confirm if the monthly or seasonal interdependencies are evolved over time for observations and climate scenarios meyer et al 2019 vrac 2018 if a significant change in the interdependence is detected an advanced multivariate method should be developed to preserve the gcm driven changes in the interdependence between a reference and projection periods climate change impacts studies usually have a cascade model chain that consists of climate models downscaling methods and domain specific impact models e g hydrologic water quality and ecological models statistical downscaling methods may improve the applicability of gcms output to impact studies at a local scale by preserving observed climate characteristics for a target region however the current downscaling and bias correction methods still have a limitation that they can not improve all shortcomings of gcms in other words a low skill gcm that poorly captures main local climatic processes is hardly improved by any statistical downscaling method leading to ill informed climate projections and subsequently mitigation and adaptations maraun et al 2017 therefore one needs to fully understand gcm biases in terms of the effects of large scale circulation within a target region and their regional responses maraun et al 2017 a model performance approach may be necessary to quantitatively evaluate gcms skill during a hindcast period and gcms with low credibility should be eliminated from a set of available climate projections the computational cost for impacts studies with a cascade model chain is usually high as multiple model runs are required to appropriately take into account uncertainty in climate projections although an ideal way to fully quantify the uncertainty is to employ as many climate projections as possible it is always neither feasible nor practical due to limited resources and high computational costs cannon 2015 therefore a methodology is desirable to systematically select a subset of climate projections that captures an envelope of climate variability farjad et al 2019 and to provide more comprehensive and reliable assessment of climate change impacts accordingly 6 conclusions this study suggested a new multivariate downscaling method that combines the quantile delta mapping qdm method with a distribution free shuffle approach mbcds which preserves the inter variable dependence structure and the climate model driven long term trends in those variables without substantial changes in model driven time sequence mbcds does not require an iterative process therefore it is a computationally efficient method the study also examined the effects of interdependence between hydro climate variables by comparing univariate and multivariate methods actively used in climate change studies in terms of both univariate distribution using etccdi indices and multivariate distribution using hydrologic indicators criteria over the historical baseline period potential changes in pet and snowfall were also investigated for the three future time windows i e the 2020 s 2050 s and 2080 s relative to the historical period the overall results of this study indicated that multivariate methods do not provide significant improvement in reproducing observed climate indices etccdis compared to the univariate method as the indices only depend on the marginal distributions of individual variables not multiple variables on the contrary the multivariate methods showed considerable improvement in all of the multivariate distribution criteria i e energy distance and mae of correlation matrices especially mbcds showed the comparatively better performance to the existing methods i e qdm mbcp and mbcn and reduced computational time by up to 53 qdm univariate method underestimated snowfall during the period from november to may which led to less swe during the winter and spring and subsequently resulting in less spring and summer flows moreover qdm overestimated rain phase precipitation and more winter flow during the winter season while mbcn over predicted snow proportion and less snow melting during the spring season mbcds and mbcp showed better agreement with the observation in hydrologic indicators the multivariate methods showed substantial effects of the interdependence between hydro climate variables in multivariate distribution criteria and indicators which depends on multiple variables among the multivariate methods the mbcds method introduced in this study can be a good alternative to provide high resolution climate projections that preserve gcm driven relative changes and the interdependence between hydro climate variables an increase in winter snowfall and a decrease in spring snowfall were projected by all methods with a significant increase in magnitude towards the 2080 s this study also found a declining trend in annual snowfall these results indicate that the projected decrease in spring snowfall is dominantly larger than the increase of winter snowfall in the future qdm projected a smaller increase in winter snowfall compared to the multivariate methods snow plays an important role in the hydrologic regime for snow dominated watersheds in alberta therefore such a systematic bias from univariate methods may lead to biased information for subsequent impact models that may lead to inappropriate climate change impact assessments and the development of

5338,statistical downscaling methods have been actively developed to improve the applicability of global climate models gcms outputs to impact studies at a local scale this study presents a multivariate bias correction mbc method that preserves gcm driven climate change signals and the interdependence between hydro climate variables by combining the quantile delta mapping qdm method with distribution free shuffle approach refer to as mbcds since mbcds also employs the gaussian rank correlation directly it does not require an iterative process to improve the gaussianity as used in existing mbc methods this study evaluated the effects of interdependence on univariate and multivariate distribution criteria and hydrologic indicators during a historical baseline period furthermore this study examined potential changes under selected cmip5 climate projections for the three future time windows application of the downscaling outputs to hydrologic simulations showed that the univariate method underestimated snowfall considerably during the snowfall period which leads to less snow accumulation and subsequently resulting in less spring and summer flows on the contrary the multivariate methods improved all of multivariate distribution criteria hydrologic indicators and the ability in reproducing snowfall depending on multiple hydro climate variables i e precipitation and temperature moreover the univariate method projected less increase in winter snowfall compared to those of multivariate methods indicating that the univariate method may result in biased future conditions in particular mbcds showed better and comparative performance compared to the existing methods with regard to climatic and hydrologic performance measures and considerably improved the computational time with up to 53 less computing time required than those of other existing methods which include an iterative process therefore this study proved that mbcds can be a good alternative to provide high resolution climate projections for impact studies at local scales further the study also demonstrated that consideration of the interdependence between hydro climate variables using multivariate methods is essential to avoid erroneous assessment of climate change impacts for snow dominated watersheds such as those in alberta canada keywords statistical downscaling multivariate bias correction hydrologic simulation alberta 1 introduction a long term plan for addressing climate change impacts on terrestrial and ecological systems needs climate projections derived from global climate models gcms that provide fundamental climate information to assess climate related impacts at the global and regional scale elguindi et al 2014 ipcc 2015 lee and wang 2014 knutti and sedláček 2013 watterson 2019 as the impacts of climate change are more critical at local scales a requirement has been growing to assess local impacts of climate change on hydrological and ecological systems by stakeholders in communities coppola et al 2018 eum et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 however direct application of gcms outputs at a local scale has been impeded by the fact that gcms are usually not capable of capturing climate variability at a local scale mainly due to coarse grid resolutions fowler et al 2007 e g 100 km on average in the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 taylor et al 2012 a remarkable advance has been made to produce higher resolution and more precise projections from gcms miyamoto et al 2013 prein et al 2015 putman and suarez 2011 however climate change studies have still suffered from the considerable systematic biases remaining in gcms outputs eum et al 2012 stevens and bony 2013 therefore downscaling and bias correction procedures are increasingly becoming a prerequisite for impact studies at local or site specific scales bennett et al 2012 christensen and lettenmaier 2007 eum et al 2014 wood et al 2004 downscaling techniques nested by gcms over a specific region have been developed to produce a higher resolution climate dataset by dynamical and statistical downscaling models alder and hostetler 2019 bürger et al 2013 gutmann et al 2014 leung et al 2004 poan et al 2018 the dynamical downscaling methods primarily rely on physical process descriptions of atmospheric phenomena by regional climate models rcms which require highly skilled experts and a high computational cost to run rcms and store their outputs however many studies have found that systematic errors still remain in rcms outputs mearns et al 2012 sillmann et al 2013 in contrast statistical downscaling methods are a cost and time efficient way to produce high resolution climate data by employing the relationships between observations and outputs of climate models to downscale and remove systematic errors in climate models outputs abatzoglou and brown 2012 eum et al 2016a wood and lettenmaier 2006 statistical downscaling methods are usually comprised of spatial disaggregation and bias correction spatial disaggregation mostly employs a simple interpolation technique eum and cannon 2017 or climate analogs abatzoglou and brown 2012 hidalgo et al 2008 hwang and graham 2013 to reproduce the small scale climate variability of observations a more crucial process in statistical downscaling is the bias correction that involves building a relationship between observed data and climate models output using either perfect prognosis pp or model output statistics mos pp is an approach that develops a statistical relationship between observed atmospheric parameters e g humidity solar radiation evaporation etc and target variables e g precipitation and temperature for application with the same atmospheric variables from the climate models to generate the corresponding target variables since a critical drawback of the pp approach is that it assumes perfect projections however it may provide a significantly biased or meaningless output if the projected parameters have a considerable bias shafer and fuelberg 2008 on the contrary mos directly formulates a transfer function of target variables between observation and simulation from a climate model therefore mos has a primary advantage that model biases and local climatology are intrinsically included in the transfer function in this regard mos based methods as an asynchronous approach have been actively applied for adjusting distributional statistics bürger et al 2009 cannon et al 2015 eum et al 2016a li et al 2010 maurer et al 2010 shukla et al 2014 many studies have employed a non parametric approach i e quantile mapping qm to bias correct climate models outputs maurer et al 2010 wood et al 2004 as prior studies have shown that non parametric approaches provide better performance on removing systematic biases of climate models gudmundsson et al 2012 the applications of qm have been advanced to avoid substantial distortions of model driven climate signals especially in extremes induced by qm bürger et al 2013 cannon 2015 li et al 2010 maraun 2013 maurer and pierce 2014 pierce et al 2015 however since qm is typically applied for individual target variables independently i e as a univariate method it simply reproduces the inter variable dependence structure derived from climate models in other words the univariate method cannot improve the interdependence between hydro climate variables when a systematic bias in the inter variable dependence structure exists in hydrologic impact studies the inaccurate interdependence of target variables e g precipitation and temperature may lead to inaccurate climate change impacts chen et al 2018 in particular the interdependence between precipitation and temperature is crucial in cold regions as the phase of precipitation i e rain snow or mixed phase depends on the interdependence harpold et al 2017 kienzle 2008 the presence of snow affects surface energy and water balance in hydrologic models with snow related processes such as snow accumulation sublimation and melting andreadis et al 2009 meyer et al 2019 therefore the interdependence bias of climate model outputs may cause misrepresentation of precipitation phase resulting in biased streamflow in the amount and timing of snow melting minimum and maximum flow and spring freshet bosshard et al 2014 eum et al 2017 harder and pomeroy 2014 mizukami et al 2013 this is especially problematic when the biased climate dataset is forced into hydrologic models as the bias in the interdependence can be adjusted on the observed streamflow by calibrating parameters resulting in spurious responses shamir and georgakakos 2006 to overcome the limitation of the univariate methods multivariate bias correction algorithms have been introduced to take into account the multivariate dependence structure bürger et al 2011 cannon 2016 2018 li et al 2014 piani and haerter 2012 vrac and friederichs 2015 while most of the developed multivariate bias correction mbc approaches remove systematic biases to reproduce a specific measure of the interdependence structure cannon 2016 such as pearson correlation mbcp and spearman rank correlation mbcr a multivariate bias correction method with the n dimensional probability density function transform mbcn suggested by cannon 2018 transfers all aspects of an observed multivariate distribution to the corresponding multivariate distribution of climate models however many multivariate techniques include an iterative process that requires a higher computational time and may also cause a convergence issue cannon 2018 to mitigate some of these problems guo et al 2019 proposed a two stage quantile mapping tsqm method employing a univariate quantile mapping method chen et al 2013 and subsequently a distribution free shuffle approach iman and conover 1982 as tsqm directly uses the gaussian rank correlation there is no need for an iterative process anymore for precipitation however the sequence of a climate model output is considerably reordered by a local intensity scaling schmidli et al 2006 which corrects the bias in wet day frequency under a strong assumption of stationarity in the wet day frequency the correction of time sequencing may cause not only the modification of spatial and temporal correlations but also inconsistency in climate forcing of physics based climate models which is a statistical artifact of the bias correction cannon 2016 maraun 2016 meyer et al 2019 as an alternative solution this study suggests a multivariate bias correction combined with the distribution free shuffle approach mbcds to 1 preserve gcm driven long term trends and time sequencing of climate models 2 reduce computational time by removing the iterative process in the algorithm and 3 preserve the interdependence of hydro climate variables in applying the suggested mbcds approach in this study firstly a quantile delta mapping qdm is applied to bias correct individual hydro climate variables separately as a univariate method for preserving model driven relative changes in all quantiles cannon et al 2015 then the bias corrected values are again corrected using the gaussian rank correlation of the observed data transformed to van der waerden scores to preserve the inter variable dependence structure in this procedure the empirical copula bias correction ec bc suggested by vrac and friederichs 2015 is implemented to restore multi dimensional copula based on the rank ordering derived from the distribution free shuffle approach further this study also inter compared the performance of mbcds to other existing multiple multivariate methods mbcn and mbcp and a univariate method qdm which has actively been applied in literature for climate and impact studies the comparison includes performance with respect to univariate and multivariate distribution criteria and hydrologic indicators simulated by a process based hydrologic model and the effects of the interdependence on climate projections 2 climate data 2 1 historical dataset a long term and reliable observed climate dataset with sufficient spatial and temporal coverage for a target region is a key factor to successfully apply a statistical downscaling technique this is because a downscaled dataset the final product of statistical downscaling corresponds to the characteristics of the observations e g marginal distribution and resolution both spatial and temporal a number of high resolution gridded climate datasets have been produced from station based hutchinson et al 2009 shen et al 2001 werner et al 2019 multiple source based lespinas et al 2015 and reanalysis mesinger et al 2006 datasets to provide consistent and long term climate information for a region however the challenge is how to systematically select the most suitable climate dataset for a large scale study domain amongst the available historical gridded climate datasets that are not consistent in terms of their spatial domain resolution number of hydro climate variables and data length eum and gupta 2019 suggested a reference reliability evaluation system refres to systematically rank multiple historical climate datasets based on performance metrics and generate a hybrid climate dataset from the multiple climate datasets available in a repository for a study domain the hybrid climate dataset provides daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperature from 1950 to 2016 at 10 km resolution over the alberta province canada this study employed this hybrid climate dataset as an observed climate dataset for statistical downscaling of gcms projections over the region 2 2 climate projections over the last decades the coupled model intercomparison project cmip has provided multiple climate models outputs to better understand past and future climate conditions focusing on climate model diagnosis validation and inter comparison meehl et al 2005 involving twenty climate modeling groups in the world the 5th phase of cmip cmip5 provided a new set of coordinated climate model experiments to evaluate mechanisms related to the cycle of greenhouse gases predictability and the variability of climate models responses taylor et al 2012 cmip5 produced both decadal meehl et al 2009 and multi decadal climate experiments under four specified representative concentration pathways rcp i e rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 in which the rcp suffixes represent estimates of the radiative forcing w m2 in the year of 2100 thomson et al 2011 taylor et al 2012 van vuuren et al 2011 as rcp8 5 represents business as usual scenarios that produce the highest emission and radiative forcings many studies employed the rcp8 5 climate scenarios as extreme projections to assess climate change impacts on hydrologic regimes eum et al 2017 flooding hoang et al 2016 sediment transport regime dibike et al 2018 ecosystem du et al 2019 this study also selected the rcp8 5 climate projections which have been previously downscaled by univariate and multivariate methods to investigate climate change impacts in alberta although intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc recommended a model democracy approach that uses all available gcms projections to fully consider the uncertainty in climate change scenarios church et al 2013 it is not practical to include all gcms scenarios in climate change impact studies because of the huge computational cost incurred for running impact models to evaluate their responses to all of climate forcing scenarios instead of employing all gcms output a subset of the gcms pool has been suggested for impact studies giorgi and mearns 2002 lutz et al 2016 recently farjad et al 2019 have categorized all of the cited methods for the gcm scenarios selection into four methods 1 hindcasting approach eum et al 2014 giorgi and mearns 2002 lutz et al 2016 2 clustering approach houle et al 2012 3 envelop approach cannon 2015 farjad et al 2019 and 4 hybrid method mcsweeney et al 2015 among them cannon 2015 suggested twelve representative gcm scenarios for western north america to fully capture climate variability in expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi zhang et al 2011 therefore this study also employed the five gcm scenarios suggested by cannon 2015 as shown in table 1 to comprehensively evaluate the skills of the univariate and multiple downscaling methods during a baseline period from 1976 to 2005 in addition this study investigated climate change impacts in alberta based on the selected five gcm scenarios the climate projections were divided into the three 30 year future time windows i e 2006 2035 2020 s 2036 2065 2050 s 2066 2095 2080 s 3 methodology 3 1 univariate downscaling method many mos based methods usually incorporate quantile mapping qm to bias correct gcms outputs e g bias correction spatial disaggregation bcsd wood et al 2004 bias correction constructed analogue bcca hidalgo et al 2008 multivariate adaptive constructed analogs maca abatzoglou and brown 2012 and bias correction stochastic analog bcsa hwang and graham 2013 by extrapolating values lying outside of a historical data range however substantial distortions of model driven climate change signals have been detected for climate variables with a strong long term trend particularly more in extreme values maraun 2013 maurer and pierce 2014 pierce et al 2015 many alternatives have been developed to preserve the long term trend of climate variables piani et al 2010 hempel et al 2013 bürger et al 2013 however they have a limitation that it does not guarantee to preserve the long term trend in extremes cannon et al 2015 suggested the quantile delta mapping qdm approach that is designed to preserve gcm driven relative changes in all quantiles based on the qm technique eum and cannon 2017 applied spatial disaggregation quantile delta mapping sdqdm for precipitation and temperature and demonstrated that sdqdm preserves the long term trend well in etccdi indices sdqdm was applied as a univariate method to be compared with multivariate methods in this study sdqdm firstly conducts the spatial disaggregation to targeted grid cells by the inverse distance squared weighted interpolation and the transfer functions of qdm are given by 1 δ m t x m f t f m c 1 f m f t x m f t f o r t e m p e r a t u r e x m f t f m c 1 f m f t x m f t f o r p r e c i p i t a t i o n 2 x m f t f o c 1 f m f x m f t δ m t f o r t e m p e r a t u r e f o c 1 f m f x m f t δ m t f o r p r e c i p i t a t i o n where δ m t is an absolute change or relative ratio for precipitation in a quantile between current and future periods at time t x m f t and x m f t are raw and bias corrected data from a climate model at time t during a future period fo c is empirical cumulative density function cdf of observed data fm c and fm f are the cdfs of modeled data for current and future periods respectively sdqdm bias corrects to match the marginal distribution properties of the observed data for a given climate variable separately 3 2 multivariate downscaling methods 3 2 1 existing multivariate methods to preserve the multivariate dependence structure multivariate bias correction mbc algorithms have been introduced in climate change studies bürger et al 2011 cannon 2016 li et al 2014 vrac and friederichs 2015 most of these algorithms rescale variables to employ anomalies assuming that the covariance of the observed anomalies is positive definite to decomposite covariance of observed data by the cholesky decomposition then the climate model anomalies are corrected by the upper triangular matrix of the observed data a product of the cholesky decomposition for preserving inter variable dependence of the observed data bürger et al 2011 cannon 2016 suggested an iterative algorithm to improve the observed correlation structure due to the absence of multivariate gaussianity in the algorithm this study applied mbc suggested by cannon 2016 to preserve pearson correlation called mbcp as an alternative of multivariate methods mbcp is designed to preserve the multivariate dependence structure by only taking the pearson correlation into account cannon 2016 in addition the iterative process in mbcp is introduced until convergence conditions measured by mean absolute error mae of correlation matrices are reached however a critical issue can be raised by the fact that the convergence is not theoretically proved in most cases cannon 2018 thus suggested a new multivariate bias correction method combined with the n dimensional probability density function transform mbcn which has been originally designed to transfer color information from a source image to another to match the impression of the source image pitié et al 2005 mbcn applies firstly qdm for climate data rotated by a random orthogonal rotation and takes the inverse rotation matrix to obtain bias corrected climate data this procedure is iterated until convergence to the multivariate distribution of observation is reached being measured by the energy distance d székely and rizzo 2004 mbcn has been proved for convergence and there is no limitation on the shape of probability density function pitié et al 2005 2007 more details on the algorithms of mbcp and mbcn are found in cannon 2016 and cannon 2018 respectively 3 2 2 multivariate bias correction with distribution free shuffle method mbcds although the iterative process in mbcn and mbcp brings added values to bias corrected climate data in reproducing the inter variable dependence structure of observed data a computational burden induced by the iterative process is inevitable for impacts studies that usually require multiple gcms projections to take into account uncertainty in climate projections guo et al 2019 suggested a two stage quantile mapping tsqm method that is comprised of a univariate daily bias correction method dbc chen et al 2013 and a distribution free shuffle approach iman and conover 1982 however tsqm substantially modifies gcm driven daily sequence of precipitation events to correct the wet day frequency of precipitation as local intensity scaling in tsqm has been originally developed to temporally downscale from annual to daily time scale this study suggests a new mbcds method that combines multivariate bias correction with the distribution free shuffle approach that preserves the marginal distributions and the gaussian rank correlation of observed data fig 1 shows a flow diagram for the mbcds procedures that consist of the following four steps 1 given an observed data x o corresponding to current and future climate model data x c and x f apply qdm for individual hydro climate variables as a univariate quantile mapping to yield bias corrected values of x c and x f 2 calculate the van der waerden scores by φ 1 i n 1 where φ 1 is the inverse function of the standard normal distribution i is the element rank of each climate variable and n is a sample size denote the van der waerden scores for x o x c and x f by w o w c and w f respectively 3 decompose the covariance matrix of w o w c and w f by cholesky decomposition to obtain the upper triangular matrix u o u c and u f and calculate the new score matrices by 3 w c w c u c 1 u o 4 w f w f u f 1 u o 4 elements of x c and x f are ordered according to the ordinal ranks of the corresponding elements of w c and w f with regard to maintaining the rank dependence structure and fitting to the marginal distribution of the observed data by qdm mbcds has a similar process to that of mbcr however mbcr first calculates anomalies of observed and modeled data and decomposes the covariance matrix estimated by spearman rank correlation as multivariate gaussianity is not proved in the algorithm of mbcr an iterative process is introduced into mbcr to improve the multivariate gaussianity in contrast mbcds calculates the gaussian rank correlation of transformed matrices by the van der waerden scores which is a robust and consistent measure of interdependence structure at the normal model nordhausen and taskinen 2015 therefore a more accurate estimate of the covariance can be obtained which in turn improves reproducing the inter variable dependence structure in addition removing the iterative process also improves computational efficiency when multivariate approaches are applied to multiple climate models over several decadal periods therefore the main advantages of mbcds are 1 the temporal sequence of climate model data can be largely maintained at least avoiding a substantial modification of the original sequence 2 the model driven long term trend can be preserved by qdm 3 the inter variable dependence structure can be preserved and 4 there is no need of an iterative process resulting in computational efficiency as climate model outputs are based on physical processes in the atmosphere ocean and land under feasible emission scenarios stationarity assumption of the frequency of climate events in tsqm may mislead the subsequent climate change impact assessments especially the sequence of extreme climate events in climate change scenarios is very crucial in hydrologic models to evaluate climate change impacts on hydrologic regimes therefore including tsqm where the sequencing of extreme climate events might be substantially altered with other downscaling methods may not allow a fair comparison of the performance of various downscaling methods in hydrologic responses consequently tsqm reconstructing the original sequence of climate model was excluded from the inter comparison of this study to validate the usefulness of multivariate methods the baseline period 1976 2005 was divided into two parts 1976 1990 and 1991 2005 to be used for calibration and validation in turn in other words the one period was used as the calibration period and then downscaled data for each of the five gcm scenarios table 1 were produced for the other period by the applied univariate and multivariate methods in this way the 30 year 1976 to 2005 downscaled data were produced and used to evaluate the skill of univariate and multivariate downscaling methods in summary mbcds mbcn mbcp and qdm were applied in this study to downscale three hydro climate variables i e precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature for the selected five gcms output and to evaluate their performance in various indicators 3 3 performance measures 3 3 1 criteria for univariate and multivariate distribution since the last two decades climate communities focused on understanding the impacts of changes in extreme events with regard to their frequency and severity the expert team in world meteorological organization wmo has coordinated an international effort to develop a suite of indices derived from daily data focusing primarily on extreme climate events peterson 2005 as a consequence of this international effort a set of extreme indices called expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi zhang et al 2011 which are related to daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperature have been developed as the etccdi indices are based on two important hydro climate variables a set of twenty six etccdi indices shown in table 2 were selected as performance criteria to evaluate the performance of univariate distribution using the downscaled climate data during the baseline period in the province of alberta canada as criteria for multivariate distribution various performance measures were used to evaluate the skill of statistical downscaling methods investigated in this study firstly the convergence measures used in mbcn and mbcp were directly employed followed by energy distance d and mean absolute error mae of correlation matrices as described in eq 5 and eq 6 respectively 5 d 2 f g 2 e x y e x y e y y 0 6 m a e 2 k k 1 i 1 k 1 j i 1 k c o r x i j c o r y i j where f and g are multivariate cumulative density functions cdfs for independent random vectors x and y e is the expected value â is the euclidean norm and k is the number of variables the target multivariate structures cdf and correlation of independent random vectors x and y are identical when d and mae are zero in addition to d and mae measures snowfall and potential evapotranspiration estimates which depends on both precipitation and temperature were used as other criteria for multivariate distribution for instance the shift from rain to snow or vice versa on a wet day depends on air temperature a static threshold method eq 7 used in the canadian ubc watershed model pipes and quick 1977 was employed to separate rain and snow in precipitation data a modified hargreaves method droogers and allen 2002 hargreaves 1994 in eq 8 was also used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration pet t ave 0 6 snow for all precipitation 0 6 t ave 3 6 rain proportion t ave 3 0 2 7 t ave 3 6 rain for all precipitation 8 p e t 0 0013 0408 r a t ave 17 0 d tr 0 0123 p 0 76 where tave is daily average temperature calculated by tmin tmax 2 ra is extraterrestrial radiation determined by latitude and date allen et al 1998 dtr is the daily temperature range between tmin and tmax and p is precipitation in mm month eq 7 and 8 were applied to estimate daily snowfall and potential evapotranspiration at 10 km grid resolution based on the observed i e the hybrid climate dataset and downscaled climate datasets 3 3 2 criteria for hydrologic processes hydrologic processes in cold regions are considerably affected by the interdependence of hydro climate variables over predict rain induced by a statistical downscaling method for instance may lead to expediting the processes in infiltration snowmelt and surface runoff in a cold region affecting magnitude and timing of extreme and seasonal streamflows bosshard et al 2014 harpold et al 2017 jepsen et al 2016 therefore biases in the interdependence between precipitation and temperature may cause unexpected biases in hydrologic processes in snow accumulation and melting evapotranspiration and runoff chen et al 2018 the nature conservancy introduced various hydrologic indicators indicators of hydrologic alteration iha to assess the human impacts on hydrologic processes the nature conservancy 2009 monk et al 2011 peters et al 2012 iha mainly quantifies magnitude timing duration frequency and change rate of hydrologic regimes shrestha et al 2014 and eum et al 2016 adapted ihas along with other water resources indicators wri to assess the characteristics of observed flow and climate change impacts further monk et al 2012 introduced key additional indicators for cold regions e g spring freshet and spring ice breakup among wris ihas and the cold region indicators eum et al 2017 selected 6 wris 4 ihas and 2 cold region indicators to evaluate climate change impacts on hydrologic regimes in the athabasca river basin as the work in eum et al 2017 this study also adapted the same hydrologic indicators except for the center of timing of annual flow that is mainly affected by spring freshet in other words 11 hydrologic indicators 5 wris 4 ihas and 2 cold region indicators as shown in table 3 were used to evaluate the skill of statistical downscaling methods used in this study the annual spring freshet initiation date and magnitude were considered as cold region indicators in table 3 spring freshet initiation is defined as when daily mean flow exceeds 1 5 times that of preceding 16 days averaged flow abdul aziz and burn 2006 this study forced the downscaled climate datasets into a process based hydrologic model called the variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1994 1996 model which has notable strength in modelling hydrologic processes in cold regions such as frozen soil limited thaw depths or where snow accumulation ablation and melting processes are common cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 cherkauer et al 2003 eum and gupta 2019 have refined a previously developed vic model eum et al 2017 for a finer spatial resolution 1 32 and demonstrated that the recently developed hybrid climate dataset provides better hydrologic simulations for the athabasca river basin arb employing the hybrid climate dataset the vic model was calibrated using observed hydrologic data at six hydrometric stations located in the upper catchment area of arb refer to fig 2 and table 4 calibration and validation periods were determined depending on the record length of each hydrometric station table 5 shows the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse at the selected five hydrometric stations the result shows that all of the nse values in calibration and validation periods are above 0 50 which is a threshold of satisfactory performance in hydrologic models moriasi et al 2007 indicating that the calibrated vic model can provide reliable hydrologic simulations the calibrated vic model was run to simulate hydrologic responses to the hybrid i e observation and downscaled climate datasets during the baseline period from 1976 to 2005 and their performance was compared using the selected 11 hydrologic indicators table 3 at the selected six hydrometric stations in the arb 4 results 4 1 performance in univariate criteria each of the five selected gcms table 1 was downscaled by mbcn mbcds mbcp and qdm separately and the extreme climate indices etccdis were calculated at each grid cell total 9 365 cells within the alberta border subsequently an ensemble mean value was calculated for each climate index from the five gcms fig 3 shows box whisker plots of selected etccdi ensemble mean values spatially averaged over alberta during the baseline period from 1976 to 2005 among twenty six etccdis nine indicators were presented in fig 3 to concisely provide a set of results the results show that each of the four downscaling methods removed the biases in the raw gcm data reasonably well annual maximum temperature values e g tnx and txx were generally underestimated by all downscaling methods while annual minimum temperatures e g tnn and txn were overestimated although the relative magnitude varied with the downscaling methods such results are mainly caused by the cold and warm bias of gcms in extreme hot and cold temperature respectively the biases in indicators related to consecutive extreme hot wsdi and cold csdi events were not improved considerably by the downscaling methods indicating that all methods maintain the original sequence of the gcms for precipitation related indicators i e prcptot and r95tot qdm performed even better than mbcn and was very comparative to mbcds and mbcp in the consecutive wet day indicator cwd gcm raw showed considerable bias due to the drizzle effect of climate models but it was corrected well by the downscaling methods fig 4 presents the spatial patterns of the selected extreme climate indices during the baseline period over alberta while obs plot in fig 4 shows calculated etccdi values corresponding to the observed data the raw gcm and downscaled gcm plots i e gcm raw mbcn mbcds mbcp and qdm shows the difference in calculated etccdi values between observation and the raw gcm as well as those downscaled by each of the four downscaling methods in each case the desired value is a difference of zero presented by green color in the maps as in fig 3 fig 4 also shows that the downscaled gcm outputs underestimated txx for most part of the province while overestimating tnn in the southern region for prcptot and r95ptot mbcn underestimated relatively more and other methods showed the same pattern that underestimates at the southwestern high elevation region overall the performance of the univariate qdm downscaling method is quite comparable to those of multivariate methods with respect to the univariate criteria 4 2 performance in multivariate criteria the performance of raw and downscaled gcm outputs with multivariate criteria was measured by the energy distance d and mean absolute error mae of correlation matrices table 6 shows seasonal energy distance and mae averaged over the 9 365 grid cells within alberta the four seasons are defined as spring from march to may mam summer from june to august jja autumn from september to november son and winter from december to february djf as expected the raw gcm output performed poorly in both the energy distance and mae mbcn performed the best in the energy distance as its algorithm incorporates the energy distance directly into the iterative process to confirm convergence to the multivariate distribution of the observed data mbcds performed comparative to mbcn and better than mbcp and qdm in both criteria it is notable that mbcds performed better than mbcp that incorporates mae into the iterative process at the same time table 7 shows the computational time required to statistically downscale a one year inm cm4 climate model output for alberta by each of the univariate and multivariate methods investigated in this study mbcds needed only 1 08 h the least cpu time while mbcn required 2 30 h to complete downscaling the one year climate dataset although qdm does not have an iterative process it also required slightly longer computational time 1 34 h than mbcds as it downscales each hydro climate variable separately these results indicate that mbcds can preserve the multivariate interdependence comparable to mbcn and better than mbcp and qdm while considerably improving the computational burden it is also notable that the seasonal maes of qdm were similar to those of the raw gcm output while qdm improved the energy distance that measures the similarity of multivariate distribution these results imply that qdm can only correct the marginal distribution to the observed data and simply reproduce the original interdependence of climate model outputs in addition to the energy distance and mae the potential evapotranspiration pet and snowfall estimates were used to measure the performance of all downscaling methods fig 5 shows monthly estimates of potential evapotranspiration pet and snowfall spatially averaged over the alberta province the raw gcm underestimated pet while overestimating snowfall from october to april compared to observed climate data obs there is no noticeable difference between the univariate and multivariate methods in reproducing pet computed from observed data the raw gcm highly overestimated snowfall during the snow cover period from october to april conversely qdm underestimated snowfall during the period from november to may which may affect snow accumulation during the snow cover period and then the magnitude of snow melting spring freshet and runoff during spring and summer seasons accordingly the effects of the interdependence were more obvious in snowfall estimates that the multivariate methods showed better agreement with that of the observation than the univariate method fig 6 also illustrates the difference in pet and snow for summer jja and winter djf respectively between the univariate and multivariate methods the pet computed from observed climate showed a spatial pattern with relatively higher values in southern alberta and lower values in the high elevation mountainous area while qdm mostly overestimated pet in the whole alberta the multivariate methods showed better agreement with that of the observed pet the observation of snow also showed a spatial pattern that is higher snow in high elevation regions due to the orographic effect on precipitation and the lapse rate of temperature the effect of multivariate methods is illustrated much more prominently in snow indicating that preserving the interdependence between precipitation and temperature by the multivariate methods is crucial to accurately reproduce snow and subsequent snow related processes 4 3 effects of the interdependence on hydrologic indicators the effect of interdependence in climate variables was assessed based on the outputs of the vic hydrologic simulations over the target region in the athabasca river basin see fig 1 for the baseline period from 1976 to 2005 the vic hydrologic model was forced by hydro climate variables of each of the five gcm outputs statistically downscaled by the univariate and multivariate methods i e mbcn mbcds mbcp and qdm fig 7 shows the monthly mean swe averaged over the target basin once again qdm underestimated swe during the snow cover period from november to april and especially larger differences compared to the observation from january to march when the annual maximum swe usually occurs on the contrary all of the multivariate methods showed good agreement with the observation fig 8 also shows the average rate of snow melting during the spring season mam for the baseline period qdm and mbcn underestimated spring snow melting at the headwater region because qdm under predicted the proportion of snow hence less swe during the winter season while mbcn over predicted the proportion of snow but less snow melting during the spring season see fig 7 in contrast mbcds and mbcp showed good agreement with relatively smaller difference in spring snowmelt from that simulated with observed climate data the performance of the different statistical downscaling techniques was also examined in terms of their ability to replicate the selected hydrologic indicators at each of the hydrometric stations within the target basin and presented in fig 9 the red line represents the median value of the indicators derived from outputs of the vic hydrologic model forced by the observed climate data for the stations located at the high elevation headwater region i e hinton and windfall climatic drivers from mbcn and qdm produced less snow melting and swe respectively both resulting in less spring mam flow qdm overestimated rain proportion in winter precipitation causing more winter djf and less summer jja flows due to less snow accumulation swe during the snow cover period mbcds and mbcp simulated freshet date and magnitude close to the observation at hinton mainly as a result of more accurate swe and snow melting simulations for the magnitude and timing of minimum and maximum flow all methods performed similarly to each other however in case of qdm maximum flows at hinton occurred earlier than other methods due to the over prediction of rain during the snow cover period similar results in the hydrologic indicators were shown for the hydrometric stations located at the tributaries i e pembina south heart and swan stations unlike at the headwater region i e hinton and windfall however it is prominent that the minimum flows by qdm at the tributaries and athabasca stations were higher than other methods because of more winter flow from rain it is also noteworthy that the spring and summer flows at athabasca station in fig 9 f under qdm were lower than those of headwater stations and were compensated by over simulated spring flows from the tributaries similar to the headwater and tributary stations winter flow by qdm was higher than observed due to the rain over prediction during the winter season djf overall qdm the univariate method over predicted winter flows and under predicted spring and summer flows due to the over predicted rain during the snow cover period which was detected distinctly at the headwater region on the other hand the multivariate methods reproduced winter and spring flows relatively better especially larger improvements were made at the headwater region more affected by snow dominated hydrologic processes 4 4 effects of the interdependence on future projections potential changes in climatic and hydrologic conditions were investigated for the three future time windows i e 2020 s 2050 s and 2080 s under rcp8 5 especially changes in pet and snowfall that are calculated by eq 7 and 8 respectively as multivariate criteria in this study fig 10 illustrates the effects of interdependence between climatic variables on snowfall projections as expected qdm univariate method induced lower snowfall during both the baseline and future periods especially in march and april compared to multivariate methods interestingly an increase in snowfall during the winter season from december to february was projected by all methods especially under far future period 2080 s while a decrease in snowfall amounts was projected during the spring and fall seasons these results indicate more precipitation under snow driving temperature below 0 conditions during the winter season are projected leading to an increase in snowfall while the more frequent rain driving mild temperature and or less precipitation are projected during the spring season as evident in fig 11 while all downscaling methods univariate and multivariate project a declining trend in annual snowfall the decline rate projected by qdm is much higher than those by the multivariate methods further mbcp projected the highest amount of annual snowfall over the period amongst all of the univariate and multivariate methods the projected snowfall by mbcds showed similar patterns in annual variability and trend to that by mbcn it is worthwhile to note that despite the projected increase in snowfall during the winter season as shown in fig 10 all the univariate and multivariate methods projected a downward trends in annual snowfall indicating that the projected decrease in snowfall during the spring and fall seasons is much larger than the increase during the winter season fig 12 presents summer pet for the baseline period and the difference of pet between the baseline hist and three future time windows for the univariate and multivariate methods these plots clearly show that summer pet is expected to increase throughout the province of alberta with a relatively larger increase in 2080 s in the southern part of the province where higher pet usually occurs historically such increase in pet may cause soil moisture deficits in future resulting in more extreme drought conditions in alberta interestingly both univariate and multivariate methods are in good agreement in showing the spatial patterns in pet change for all the future time windows similarly fig 13 presents the spatial pattern of changes in winter snowfall over alberta indicating the projected increase in most parts of the province which is consistent with the results shown in fig 10 with an exception in some parts of southern and western regions where a decrease in snowfall is projected further all downscaling methods projected a larger increase in snowfall over the high elevation mountainous region bordering the province of british columbia indicating that extreme winter snowfall events may occur more frequently in the future as expected qdm relatively underestimated the change in projected snowfall during winter compared to the multivariate methods as snow is a crucial component for seasonal water availability in snow dominated watersheds such a systematic bias induced by a downscaling method e g univariate method may have a potential to significantly influence or cause biases in hydrologic projections such as a relatively faster decline in snow and glacier volumes snowmelt and subsequent seasonal flows over time 5 discussion whether considering the interdependence between climate variables may bring added values in impact studies is still a debatable subject for instance some researches have assessed the effects of interdependence on fire risk indicators but found a marginal improvement yang et al 2015 casanueva et al 2018 räty et al 2018 also indicated that it is difficult to demonstrate that multivariate methods may significantly reduce biases in hydrologic indicators on the contrary the effects of multivariate methods have been clearly identified with the canadian fire weather index cannon 2018 heat stress fire risk indicators zscheischler et al 2019 and snowmelt driven streamflow meyer et al 2019 furthermore they concluded that substantial improvements by multivariate methods can be found when 1 the climate models have considerable biases in the interdependence 2 selected impact indicators are highly dependent on multiple variables and 3 the applied model is capable of capturing the impact of interdependence between variables zscheischler et al 2019 this study also investigated the effects of interdependence between hydro climate variables on multiple univariate and multivariate distribution criteria the results showed that there is little difference between univariate and multivariate methods for the univariate criteria i e etccdi and pet where the interdependence between variables is not a factor and can be ignored however the multivariate methods performed better in reducing biases in the multivariate distribution criteria and hydrologic indicators where the interdependence of multiple variables is an important factor there was little improvement in the case of etccdis and pet because etccdis are not depending on multiple variables i e based on a single climate variable and the pet used in this study was calculated primarily from minimum and maximum temperature that usually have high interdependence which is accurately simulated by gcms this study also demonstrated the pronounced effects of the multivariate methods on multivariate distribution criteria such as snowfall and snow related hydrologic indicators e g swe spring and winter flows and spring freshet in general the effects of a multivariate method can be significant for those indicators strongly affected by multiple climate variables e g snow related indices déry et al 2005 eum et al 2016b energy supply indices sterl et al 2018 and arid index woli et al 2012 this study also showed that as the multivariate methods adjust the bias in the interdependence between precipitation and temperature more precipitation at snow inducing temperatures were produced by the multivariate methods compared to those of the univariate method qdm resulting in higher amounts of snowfall and swe mbcds performed better than mbcp and qdm and was comparable to mbcn for the multivariate distribution criteria as shown in table 6 based on the cross validation of this study however mbcn underestimated snow melting at the headwater mountainous region during the spring season fig 8 indicating colder temperature on dry days and subsequently overestimated swe fig 7 on the contrary mbcds showed good agreement with the observation driven hydrologic simulation obs the impacts of climate change for snow dominated watersheds has been investigated as a change of snowfall that may induce a change in the amounts of snow cover and a shift of snowmelt and spring freshet timing bennett et al 2012 coppola et al 2018 eum et al 2017 therefore the biases in the interdependence between precipitation and temperature may lead to erroneous assessments of climate change impacts and subsequently inappropriate adaptations and mitigation strategies furthermore mbcds simplified the procedures by incorporating the gaussian rank correlation instead of an iterative algorithm and consequently reduced the computational time considerably table 7 since climate change impacts assessments require employing as many of multiple climate scenarios as possible to incorporate uncertainty in climate change signals and their potential effects on climate sensitive systems availability of computationally efficient downscaling methods and domain specific impact assessment models becomes crucial to complete such studies in a timely manner the suggested computationally efficient mbcds multivariate downscaling method is a good alternative to provide high resolution climate projections for regions where the interdependence between hydro climate variables play an important role in hydrologic processes the assumption of stationarity in statistical downscaling methods is another fundamental issue where there is no consensus between scientific communities fowler et al 2007 maraun et al 2010 wang et al 2018 besides the assumption of stationarity in marginal distributions for qdm a univariate method applied in this study the multivariate methods also assumed stationarity in inter variable dependence structure preserving the interdependence of observation between climate variables over a projection period contrary to the original ec bc method that preserves the rank of references vrac and friederichs 2015 the sequences of climate projections for the multivariate methods investigated in this study i e mbcp mbcn and mbcds were reordered by the ordinal ranks of new matrices eq 3 and eq 4 resulting in evolving interdependence over time however it is necessary to confirm if the monthly or seasonal interdependencies are evolved over time for observations and climate scenarios meyer et al 2019 vrac 2018 if a significant change in the interdependence is detected an advanced multivariate method should be developed to preserve the gcm driven changes in the interdependence between a reference and projection periods climate change impacts studies usually have a cascade model chain that consists of climate models downscaling methods and domain specific impact models e g hydrologic water quality and ecological models statistical downscaling methods may improve the applicability of gcms output to impact studies at a local scale by preserving observed climate characteristics for a target region however the current downscaling and bias correction methods still have a limitation that they can not improve all shortcomings of gcms in other words a low skill gcm that poorly captures main local climatic processes is hardly improved by any statistical downscaling method leading to ill informed climate projections and subsequently mitigation and adaptations maraun et al 2017 therefore one needs to fully understand gcm biases in terms of the effects of large scale circulation within a target region and their regional responses maraun et al 2017 a model performance approach may be necessary to quantitatively evaluate gcms skill during a hindcast period and gcms with low credibility should be eliminated from a set of available climate projections the computational cost for impacts studies with a cascade model chain is usually high as multiple model runs are required to appropriately take into account uncertainty in climate projections although an ideal way to fully quantify the uncertainty is to employ as many climate projections as possible it is always neither feasible nor practical due to limited resources and high computational costs cannon 2015 therefore a methodology is desirable to systematically select a subset of climate projections that captures an envelope of climate variability farjad et al 2019 and to provide more comprehensive and reliable assessment of climate change impacts accordingly 6 conclusions this study suggested a new multivariate downscaling method that combines the quantile delta mapping qdm method with a distribution free shuffle approach mbcds which preserves the inter variable dependence structure and the climate model driven long term trends in those variables without substantial changes in model driven time sequence mbcds does not require an iterative process therefore it is a computationally efficient method the study also examined the effects of interdependence between hydro climate variables by comparing univariate and multivariate methods actively used in climate change studies in terms of both univariate distribution using etccdi indices and multivariate distribution using hydrologic indicators criteria over the historical baseline period potential changes in pet and snowfall were also investigated for the three future time windows i e the 2020 s 2050 s and 2080 s relative to the historical period the overall results of this study indicated that multivariate methods do not provide significant improvement in reproducing observed climate indices etccdis compared to the univariate method as the indices only depend on the marginal distributions of individual variables not multiple variables on the contrary the multivariate methods showed considerable improvement in all of the multivariate distribution criteria i e energy distance and mae of correlation matrices especially mbcds showed the comparatively better performance to the existing methods i e qdm mbcp and mbcn and reduced computational time by up to 53 qdm univariate method underestimated snowfall during the period from november to may which led to less swe during the winter and spring and subsequently resulting in less spring and summer flows moreover qdm overestimated rain phase precipitation and more winter flow during the winter season while mbcn over predicted snow proportion and less snow melting during the spring season mbcds and mbcp showed better agreement with the observation in hydrologic indicators the multivariate methods showed substantial effects of the interdependence between hydro climate variables in multivariate distribution criteria and indicators which depends on multiple variables among the multivariate methods the mbcds method introduced in this study can be a good alternative to provide high resolution climate projections that preserve gcm driven relative changes and the interdependence between hydro climate variables an increase in winter snowfall and a decrease in spring snowfall were projected by all methods with a significant increase in magnitude towards the 2080 s this study also found a declining trend in annual snowfall these results indicate that the projected decrease in spring snowfall is dominantly larger than the increase of winter snowfall in the future qdm projected a smaller increase in winter snowfall compared to the multivariate methods snow plays an important role in the hydrologic regime for snow dominated watersheds in alberta therefore such a systematic bias from univariate methods may lead to biased information for subsequent impact models that may lead to inappropriate climate change impact assessments and the development of

5339,the potential of biocrusts biological soil crusts to generate runoff is a matter of great controversy especially in arid and semiarid regions most authors maintain that runoff in the presence of biocrusts is generated as a result of hydrophobicity crust structure texture or surface roughness hypothesizing that runoff over biocrusts may result from partial pore clogging brought on by extracellular polymeric substances eps we compare two crust types from nizzana in the northwestern negev israel nizid nizpon that readily generate runoff under natural field conditions to a crust type from nizzanim in the southern coast of israel nimid that fails to generate runoff we hypothesize that biocrust induced eps of the niz crusts will have different biochemical and viscoelastic properties than that of nim we conducted sprinkling experiments on the crusts measured the biochemical properties thickness water repellency compressive strength water holding capacity silt and clay content roughness and the adhesion and viscoelastic properties of the crust eps using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d both crusts were not water repellent and were characterized by a relatively smooth surface the niz crusts were however characterized by higher water holding capacity and compressive strength as far as the eps is concerned higher shear viscosity and shear modulus characterized the niz crusts indicating higher crust integrity and rigidity and the formation of durable mineral grain eps matrix of the niz crusts the findings point to a possible link between crust rigidity and runoff coefficients providing supporting evident for the role played by eps in crust formation and runoff generation knowledge regarding the potentiality of runoff and hence water redistribution may assist in ecosystem management and agroforestry practices keywords biological soil crust extracellular polymeric substances infiltration pore clogging negev desert 1 introduction runoff is among the most researched topic in hydrology martinez hernández et al 2017 it determines erosion sedimentation and plant establishment le bissonnais 2016 and serves as an important tool for the study of plant distribution and ecosystem structure and function neilson 1995 runoff generation is especially important in arid regions where saturation of the upper surface skin commonly 1 mm thick hinders infiltration thus resulting in runoff a process known as infiltration excess flow or hortonian overland flow horton 1933 cammeraat 2004 as a result water redistribution takes place providing preferential habitats with enhanced biological activity often used in agroforestry to form loci with high productivity shanan et al 1970 welderufael et al 2012 large areas in arid and semiarid regions are covered in biocrusts also known as biological soil crusts they affect hydrological processes such as evaporation kidron and tal 2012 and runoff kidron and

runoff is easily generated on fine grained soils whether biocrusts are present or not mualem et al 1990 le bissonnais et al 1995 this is not the case on sand although characterized by high porosity and exhibiting extremely high infiltration rates 300 mm h 1 see lichner et al 2010 runoff production may nevertheless take place on biocrust covered dune sands in sandy subhumid regions runoff was shown to stem from water repellency hydrophobicity attributed to the properties of the crust substances this phenomenon is confined to the beginning of a rain event following a long dry spell rutin 1983 once hitting the ground the water drops ball up wessel 1988 and practically remain on the surface until certain moisture content is reached 3 on sand according to oostindie et al 2013 under these conditions runoff takes place regardless of rain intensity rutin 1983 while substantiated for humid regions the mechanism responsible for runoff generation under arid conditions remains unclear although claimed to take place also in the tabernas desert spain rodriguez caballero et al 2013 water repellency was not reported under natural field conditions and as thoroughly discussed kidron 2019 the expected runoff dynamics high runoff yield during the beginning of the rainy season and regardless of intensity did not coincide with the dynamics described for the tabernas desert no supportive evidence has been provided for two out of the three other mechanisms put forth to explain runoff generation in arid and semiarid zones surface roughness belnap 2006 and structure souza egipsy et al 2002 belnap 2006 felde et al 2014 while acting to reduce the amount of runoff kidron 2007 roughness cannot prevent ponding and runoff initiation kidron et al 2012 and subsequently water flow in preferential water paths i e rills pierson et al 2007 the structure hypothesis claiming that an air gap in between the crust and the subcrust impedes infiltration as suggested for nizzana northwestern negev desert israel has not been supported as an air gap should result in high runoff yield during the beginning of a rain event before the raindrop impact eliminates the air gap however runoff was not produced during the beginning of storms kidron and yair 1997 this leaves the third mechanism the partial pore clogging ppc as the main driver for runoff generation over sandy dunes however there is no consensus surrounding the ppc mechanism and even when adopted controversy exists regarding the factors responsible for surface clogging some attribute ppc to the crust thickness yair 2001 or the fines silt and clay content within the crust yair and verrecchia 2002 others regard the amount and properties of the extra polymeric substances eps primarily consisting of exopolysaccharides as the causal factor for ppc kidron et al 1999 2003 fischer et al 2010 while some scholars insist that eps either does not affect pore clogging felde et al 2016 or even promotes infiltration rossi et al 2012 the relatively fast water adsorption rate and the high adsorption capacity of the eps chenu 1993 or et al 2007 may support rapid ppc subsequently triggering runoff generation verrecchia et al 1995

an important component of most biocrusts it may affect crust elasticity its capability to return to its initial state once a force that is implemented on the crust is removed and rigidity the amount of resistance with which the material opposes change of form both of which may dictate crust coherence and integrity following years of field measurements during which runoff generated in the negev at nizzana niz but failed to generate from the biocrusted surfaces of the israel coast of nizzanim nim we hypothesize that biocrust induced eps of the niz crusts will have different biochemical and viscoelastic properties than that of nim as a result of a successful attempt to evaluate the eps properties with the use of quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d kidron et al

which readily produced runoff under natural rain conditions nizid nizpon and one that failed to produce runoff under natural rain conditions nimid 2 material and methods 2 1 the research sites and previous findings biocrusts were collected from two sandy dunefields the hallamish dunefield near nizzana hereafter niz in the northwestern negev desert and the nizzanim dunefield in the southern coast of israel near ashdod hereafter nim fig 1 a both dunefields receive rain precipitation during the winter months mainly between november and april nevertheless although only 90 km apart they experience different climates aridic in niz and mediterranean in nim bitan and rubin 1991 niz is characterized by long term annual precipitation of 95 mm 1950 1980 rosenan and gilad 1985 with mean precipitation of only 66 5 mm in the last two decades kidron 2015a annual evaporation is 2600 mm evenari 1981 the mean daily annual temperature 1995 2009 in niz is 20 1 c it is 27 1 c during the hottest month of july and 12 0 c during the coldest month of january http www meteo tech co il negev negev daily asp as for nim annual precipitation is 502 mm and annual evaporation is 1500 mm mean maximum daily temperature is 20 1 c it is 26 5 c during the hottest month of july and 12 9 c during the coldest month of january http www ims gov il ims climate climaticatlas tempnormals htm longitudinal dunes 15 20 m high characterize niz the dunes are separated by 50 200 m interdunes fig 1b barchans dunes 15 20 m high with 100 m diameter interdunes characterize nim fig 1c both dunefields have quartzose sand with low amounts 5 7 of silt and clay in both dunefields biocrusts only partially cover the dune slopes mostly the bottom of the slopes and are rare at the crests where wind velocity is too high and surface stability too low to facilitate undisturbed crust growth levin et al 2007 kidron and zohar 2014 the crusts up to several millimeters in thickness cover extensive areas in both interdunes they cover 90 of all sandy surfaces of the niz interdunes and 50 of the surfaces of the nim interdunes levin et al 2007 kidron et al 2010 at nim the interdune crusts reach the highest biomass termed hereafter nimid fig 1d the interdune at niz is characterized by a more complex microtopography while most of the interdune is characterized by relatively smooth 1 1 2 mm thick crusts termed nizid fig 1e small depressions commonly 2 4 m in diameter with a thicker crust are scattered within the interdunes serving as sinks for adjacent runoff kidron 2014 the crust at these depressions termed nizpon exhibit occasional ponding as a result the crusts may roll up giving crusts a unique appearance fig 1f crust species composition is variable cyanobacterial crusts with microcoleus vaginatus and phormidium sp predominate in the interdunes of niz both nizid and nizpon a mixed cyanobacterial and green algal crust characterize nim the nim crust is predominated by microcoleus vaginatus cyanobacteria and klebsormidium sp green algae kidron and büdel 2014 runoff measurements were conducted on both sites during 1990 1994 in niz and during 2005 2008 in nim in both study sites runoff was measured in a pair of 4 6 m2 plots that were constructed over the biocrusted surfaces all runoff was collected in large buckets rain measurements conducted with a tipping bucket rain recorder in one minute niz and 10 minute nim intervals allowed for a thorough analysis of the rain depth intensity frequency and subsequently of the rain runoff relationships while runoff was readily produced in niz even in medium intensities of 9 mm h on sufficiently wet biocrusts no runoff was observed in nim albeit the much higher rain amount 5 fold higher and the higher frequency and longer duration of high rain intensities in nim kidron and büdel 2014 thus 10 min long rain intensities of 9 mm h 1 amounted to 45 2 220 mm of the total rain in nim while amounting to only 13 2 13 mm in niz on average 3 25 runoff events were annually recorded in niz runoff was intermittent in accordance with the intermittent character of the medium and high intensity rain burst with runoff commonly lasting for less than a dozen minutes per rain burst runoff on cyanobacterial crusts increased with the increase in the chlorophyll content of the crust and thus higher runoff yields were obtained from the high chlorophyll north facing cyanobacterial crusts which also had higher amounts of eps kidron et al 2003 higher amounts of runoff were also obtained from the relatively high biomass cyanobacterial crusts that inhabited the small depression of the niz interdune kidron 2014 2 2 field sampling and measurements field sampling and measurements took place in nizid nizpon and nimid during the summer of 2014 field sampling included crusts to measure crust thickness water holding capacity whc compressive strength cs and fine content fc i e silt and clay of crusts additional samples were also collected for sprinkling experiments to determine of the chlorophyll a content hereafter chlorophyll chl and total carbohydrates crb of the crusts and for the examination of the of eps viscoelastic variables rigidity viscosity shear modulus and thickness using qcm d for crust thickness fc whc cs and sprinkling 6 crusted samples were collected from each habitat crust thickness was determined using a caliper as for fc and whc approximately 30 g were collected from each habitat for cs 1 cm thick and 3 cm in diameter crusts were collected and for the sprinkling experiment the upper 5 cm of the crusted soil 5 cm in diameter were collected using a corer all samples were moistened prior to sampling to avoid crust disintegration for chl and crb twelve 1 2 diameter and 1 cm thick samples were collected from each habitat two pairs of six samples 50 g of the upper crusts from each habitat were collected to determine eps properties and a composite sample was created from each pair following the protocol suggested by ying et al 2010 field measurements included crust thickness crust roughness microrelief mr and hydrophobicity using the water drop penetration time test wdpt twelve crusts from each habitat were used to determine the crust thickness using a caliper kidron et al 2010 six randomly chosen loci in each habitat were used for mr measurements the microrelief meter is 18 8 cm long with rods spaced at 3 1 mm apart as described elsewhere kidron 2007 the variance in rod height in absolute values represented roughness sanchez and wood 1987 as for wdpt the test was undertaken under dry wdptdry and wet wdptwet conditions in the field by placing a drop of distilled water on the crust surface a total of 30 drops for each crust and measuring the time that it took for the drop to infiltrate the soil kidron et al 2010 according to this method drop penetration of 60 s indicates severe hydrophobocity drop penetration of 5 60 s indicates moderate hydrophobicity while drop penetration of 5 s indicates lack of hydrobobicity bisdom et al 1993 2 3 lab measurements 2 3 1 measurements of whc cs fc the whc was measured by adding distilled water to a known weight of a dry crust once reaching an equilibrium following 1 h the whc was calculated based on the amount of water that was required to reach complete saturation relative to the dry weight of the crust in accordance with the equation 1 whc wsp ws ws ws 100 where whc water holding capacity wsp weight of soil and water in saturated paste g ws dry weight of soil following oven drying at 105 c g the cs of the crust was measured by a method modified from katznelson 1989 crusts 3 cm in diameter and 1 cm thick were gently placed on a platform with a 1 4 cm diameter opening at its center each crust sample was placed above the opening a 1 2 cm diameter plate connected to a narrow container was placed above the center of the crust water was gently added to the container increasing the pressure of the plate on the crust until it broke crust strength was determined as the total weight of the container plus the amount of water necessary to break the crust kidron et al 2010 the fines content was determined by wet sieving prior to sieving 30 ml of distilled water with 0 5 hexametaphosphate calgon was added to 15 g of soil serving to separate between the clay minerals or clays adsorbed to sand grains and treated for 10 min by ultrasonic waves thereafter the soil was rinsed over a 63 µm mesh and the amount rinsed through the mesh i e the silt and clay 63 µm was weighed őzer and orhan 2015 2 3 2 sprinkling experiments sprinkling experiments were conducted on all three crusts nizid nizpon nimid the experiments were conducted with a mini sprinkler as described by kidron 2007 for sprinkling distilled water at an intensity of 22 5 mm h 1 was used this intensity is within the lower range of high intensity rains that were shown to produce runoff in the negev kidron and yair 1997 each experiment lasted for 15 consecutive minutes which is substantially longer than the consecutive time duration during which high intensity rain spells occur see kidron 2011 and the runoff produced was measured and calculated in millimeters it included the time it took for the water to pond on the surface resulting in crust shininess the time for runoff initiation i e time to runoff ttr and runoff coefficient rc runoff coefficient was calculated in accordance with the equation 2 rc r p 100 where rc runoff coefficient in percent r the amount of runoff obtained ml and p the amount of the precipitated water ml 2 3 3 biochemical properties chl was extracted by hot methanol 70 c 20 min in the presence of mgco3 0 1 w v in sealed test tubes and assayed according to wetzel and westlake 1969 after the extraction of the chlorophyll the samples were used for carbohydrate crb determination by the anthrone method hassid and abraham 1957 in addition to chl and crb of the crusts the biochemical properties of the eps were also evaluated first the eps were extracted from the crusts samples and analyzed by a fixation step the analysis included the addition of 0 22 formaldehyde followed by the addition of 1 n sodium hydroxide to facilitate the dissociation of the acidic groups in the eps to the solution liu and fang 2002 the suspension was thereafter centrifuged 20 000 g 15 min 4 c filtered through a 0 22 μm hydrophilic nylon filter millipore co and dialyzed through a dialysis membrane of 3500 da spectra por polysaccharide and protein contents in the eps were analyzed colorimetrically according to dubois et al 1956 and bradford 1977 methods respectively 2 3 4 eps adhesion tests with qcm d eps adherence and viscoelastic properties were analyzed during adsorption to silica coated crystals in a qcm d for at least two independent adsorption experiments dissolved eps samples were filtered through a 0 22 µm hydrophilic pvdf filter and thereafter set to concentration of 25 mg l as dissolved organic carbon doc in 100 mm nacl background solution by providing real time measurements of molecular absorption and or interactions which takes place on the quartz crystals the qcm d provides essential information such as the structural properties of the adsorbed layers of the interaction between microorganism derived eps and the sand grains nguyen and elimelech 2007 obtaining similar results one set of experimental data is presented in this study the qcm d measurements were performed with at cut quartz crystals mounted in an e4 system biolin scientific q sense the crystals coated with the amorphous silica have a fundamental resonance frequency of 5 mhz kwon et al 2006 before each measurement the crystals were soaked in 5 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta solution for 30 min rinsed thoroughly with double distilled water dried with pure n2 gas and treated for 10 min in a uv o3 bioforce nanoscience chamber using a digital peristaltic pump operating in sucking mode all qcm d experiments were performed under flow through conditions of 150 µl min prior to each of the qcm d experiments and after cleaning the crystals a baseline with distilled water was acquired in order to analyze the effects of crust origin on associated eps adsorption eps thickness and viscoelastic properties three solutions were injected sequentially to the qcm d system in the following order i 100 mm nacl background solution ii dissolved eps in 100 mm nacl at concentration of 25 mg l as doc iii 100 mm nacl in accordance with a protocol reported by ying et al 2010 frequency variations δf hz and dissipation factors δd were measured for three overtones n 5 7 and 9 the viscoelastic properties of the eps layers were calculated based on the voigt model according to voinova et al 1999 the density and viscosity of the solution used in this model were 1 g cm3 and 10 3 pa s respectively following the recommendations of gurdak et al 2005 the density of the adsorbed layer was fixed at 1 030 g cm3 for the receipt of the best fitting values of the shear viscosity η shear modulus μ and voigt thickness dvoigt of the adsorbed layer modeling the experimental data of δf and δd for three overtones was undertaken for this end we used the q tools biolin scientific q sense 2 4 statistical analysis in order to compare the values of the different variables one way anova tests and bonferroni post hoc test were applied using spss version 11 il chicago usa except for mr where we first applied transformation square root to obtain a distribution close to normal the perquisites of normality and homogeneity of variances were met for all other variables therefore allowing for the use of original values simple t tests were conducted to examine the relationships between biochemical properties and runoff coefficient differences were regarded significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 biochemical properties crust thickness wdpt mr fc chl crb and species composition of the three crust types are shown in table 1 while whc cs and the ratio of crb to chl are shown in fig 2 except for non significant differences of wdptdry and chl for nizpon and nimid cs for nizid and nizpon and mr for all crusts all other variables exhibited significant differences among the crusts although wdptdry was significantly higher for nizpon and nimid all values fell below 5 s indicating that all crusts were hydrophilic rather than hydrophobic as for mr the crusts did not exhibit significant differences with all crusts exhibiting a relatively smooth surface crust thickness showed however a clear pattern with nimid nizpon nizid on the other hand nimid exhibited the lowest fc following the pattern nizpon nizid nimid yet nimid exhibited the highest chl with nimid nizpon nizid crb was higher in nizpon and followed the pattern nizpon nizid nimid as for whc cs and the ratio of crb to chl a clear pattern is shown with nizpon nizid nimid yet cs and the ratio of crb to chl were only significantly different between both niz crusts and nimid indicating higher eps and higher strength for the niz crusts 3 2 sprinkling experiments no runoff was produced by nimid runoff was however produced by nizid and nizpon with nizpon yielding significantly higher amounts than nizid this can be seen in fig 3 that shows representative graphs and fig 4 a and 4b that show the average amount of time that took the crusts to produce runoff time to runoff ttr and the average value of runoff coefficient rc respectively both niz crusts nizpon and nizid reached saturation within 3 5 min since the onset of the sprinkling experiment as reflected by the crust shininess with ttr lagging behind between 5 and 15 min runoff could not have been explained by hydrophobicity nor by the crust biomass chlorophyll or thickness the thickest crust and the crust with the highest biomass nimid failed to yield runoff 3 3 eps fig 5 shows the properties of the eps which were extracted from the three crust types nizpon exhibited the highest values of doc tn and ps but not of pr which was the highest at nimid overall as far as the eps is concerned the ratios of ps to pr were higher for the niz crusts especially for nizpon additional information on the eps was obtained by the qcm d the capability of the eps to attach to the silica coated sensor of the qcm d is reflected by the frequency shift δf and by the dissipation factor i e the loss of energy as reflected by δd fig 6 a 6b the eps of the niz crusts showed much higher capability to attach to the sensor as indicated by the higher decrease of the frequency shift δf and higher loss of energy δd caused by the eps of the niz crusts in comparison to that of the nim crust the high ratio of δd δf exhibit in accordance with the voigt model nguyen and elimelech 2007 orgad et al 2011 elevated energy loss per oscillation frequency due to adsorption of eps of the niz crusts providing additional indication for the elevation in the eps viscoelasticity of the eps of the niz crusts fig 7 a fig 7b and 7c show higher viscosity and shear modulus of the eps of the niz crusts additionally the eps of the niz crusts exhibited a much thicker hydrated layer fig 7d which may all provide the niz crusts higher integrity and more rigid aggregates 3 4 relationships between biochemical variables and runoff coefficient given the small number of crust types the contribution of a statistical analysis is obviously limited nevertheless it may provide supporting evidence regarding the role played by the different variables when linear correlations were sought no significant relationships were found between rc and crust thickness hydrophobicity mr fc chl and crb three of the variables exhibited significant relationships cs r 2 0 88 p 0 018 whc r 2 0 99 p 0 012 and the ratio of crb to chl r 2 0 98 p 0 045 4 discussion sprinkling experiments showed high variability while produced by the niz crusts runoff was not produced by the nim crust as for niz substantially higher amounts were obtained from nizpon in comparison to nizid in agreement with two year long field measurements kidron 2014 the higher amounts obtained by the nizpon crusts in comparison to the nizid crusts were in agreement with previous findings that showed a close link between the biomass of cyanobacterial crusts and runoff yield kidron et al 2003 yet albeit the higher chl of nimid no runoff was produced by the nim crust this was in agreement with field measurements from nim which did not record any runoff during three years of consecutive measurements kidron and büdel 2014 the findings could not have been explained by hydrophobicity or mr both exhibiting similar values in all crusts or by the thickness all of which exhibited non significant relationships with rc thus the thickest crust nimid failed to produce runoff as for cs whc and ratio of crb to chl all yielded significant relationships with rc and as will be outlined below all are linked to the eps as for fc while it may increase the compressive strength of the crusts no significant relationship was found between fc and rc moreover detailed experiments could not support its cardinal role in pore clogging of the biocrustal surfaces this issue was thoroughly explored in a previous research during which sprinkling experiments on moss dominated crusts with high fc 39 1 did not yield higher runoff in comparison to cyanobacterial crusts having only half the amount 15 4 of fc kidron 2015b this was accounted for by the very low amount of expanding 2 1 clays such as montmorillonite within the fc felde et al 2018 the very minor effect of fines on runoff generation was also supported under natural field conditions on scalped cyanobacterial crusts runoff was readily produced on the scalped plots during the beginning of the third year despite the meager amounts of dust fines that accumulated on these plots kidron 2007 extensive measurements of runoff over biocrusts in the negev kidron 1999 kidron et al 2003 the israeli mediterranean coast kidron and büdel 2014 and the chihuahuan desert kidron et al 2012 pointed to the cardinal role played by ppc in runoff generation in previous publications this was explained by the high correlation between rc and the ratio of crb to chl and supported by sem pictographs thus while showing copious amounts of eps in the niz crusts which readily yielded runoff kidron et al 2003 eps was hardly noted in the nim crusts kidron and büdel 2014 and in the crusts from the white sands national monument in the chihuahuan desert kidron et al 2012 both of which exhibited low ratios of crb to chl both these crusts failed to yield runoff during 3 and 5 years of consecutive field measurements respectively a low ratio of crb to chl also characterizes nimid during the current research thus in comparison to a crb chl ratio of 341 0 and 240 4 for nizpon and nizid respectively it was only 83 7 for nimid yet contrary to previous analyses during which only the ratio crb to chl was evaluated the current research focuses on the relevant properties of the eps which may determine whether or not ppc may take place this is indicated by the high doc and ps of the niz crusts while the close link between rc and the ratios of ps pr is not yet clear fig 5e a possible link between the high adsorption capacity of carbohydrates or et al 2007 and the high rc cannot be ruled out altogether as verified by the high whc exhibited by the niz crusts the eps of the niz crusts showed high adsorption capability it exhibited also high elasticity and viscosity the higher elevation of the viscoelasticity of the niz crusts is indicated by the higher rigidity of the crust as noted by the loss of energy δd per oscillation cycle δf of the qcm d sensor caused by the adsorption of eps of the niz crusts the higher viscosity and elasticity as well as the higher hydrated thickness also point to the higher integrity and coherence of the niz crusts ying et al 2010 apparently responsible for the formation of firm mineral grain eps matrix this may explain the higher compressive strength of the niz crusts additionally the eps of the niz crusts exhibited a much thicker hydrated layer implying higher capability of water adsorption higher water adsorption may also be linked to the amount of eps i e to the high ratio of crb to chl this will result in higher capability of these crusts to adsorb water as reflected indeed in the higher whc of the niz crusts all the above properties rigidity elasticity viscosity and the greater hydrated thickness of the eps should greatly affect pore clogging and subsequently runoff the high elasticity of the eps as also indicated by the high cs of the niz crusts is likely to prevent crust fragility and subsequently water entry through cracks similarly the high viscosity and the higher hydrated thickness along with the higher eps may facilitate higher water adsorption as also indicated by the higher whc of the niz crusts all three variables the ratio crb to chl whc cs yielded indeed significant relationships with rc with eps exhibiting high water adsorption chenu 1993 or et al 2007 high amounts of eps of the niz crusts as deduced from the high ratio of crb to chl may imply that the niz crusts are likely to readily swell resulting in ppc which under sufficient rain intensity will generate runoff kidron et al 2003 2012 in addition to the overall higher amounts of eps some properties of the eps such as elasticity viscosity and the greater hydrated thickness may further enhance the capability of the biocrust to adsorb water and thus to increase ppc as previously suggested kidron et al 2003 2012 kidron and büdel 2014 the amounts and properties of the eps are species dependent one should note that the crust types that did not yield runoff that of the southern coast of israel and that of the white sands national monument usa had a high proportion of green algae which as evident by the sem pictographs kidron and büdel 2014 exhibited only low amounts of eps our results are not in agreement with some of the models suggested in the literature contrary to views that maintain that runoff is determined by roughness and is not linked to species composition belnap 2006 our results indicate that a even smooth crusts like nimid did not produce runoff and therefore roughness could not have been regarded as responsible for runoff and b that the amounts and properties of the eps are determined by species composition as also found elsewhere guan and cao 2019 moreover contrary to the view that eps increase infiltration rossi et al 2012 or is not involved in ppc felde et al 2016 the current findings point to the cardinal role played by the eps in increasing crust rigidity and decreasing infiltration felde et al 2016 examined crusts in a dry state and concluded that the similar volume of the crusts point to the fact that the crust eps does not take part in ppc this conclusion is however problematic under field conditions eps will reduce pore clogging only under wet conditions and subsequently water adsorption field conditions were also not mimicked by rossi et al 2012 rossi et al 2012 used edta to extract the eps from the crust thereafter measuring the infiltration within petri dishes with mini disc tension infiltrometer in the lab as confirmed during our research not only may eps properties differ among crusts not necessarily impeding infiltration as was the case in nimid but the use of different chemicals in test preparation may change the viscoelastic properties of the crust erto et al 2010 more et al 2014 and therefore may affect water adsorption and subsequently pore clogging our findings also show that in addition to different principally optic methods currently used to study the eps properties wu et al 2009 qcm d may also serve as an additional tool to characterize the adhesion and the mechanical properties of eps layers moreover as previously indicated flemming and wingender 2001 the findings point to the cardinal role played by eps in determining the structure and function of biocrusts our findings substantiate the use of the amount of eps as deduced by the ratio of total carbohydrates to that of protein or chlorophyll content to serve as a proxy indicator of crust runoff production moreover due to the close link between runoff coefficient and whc and cs the possible use of both whc and cs as indicators for runoff generation should also be explored for arid and semiarid zones understanding the driving mechanism for hortonian overland flow over biocrusts is imperative with runoff over biocrusts playing a central role in water redistribution kidron 1999 and with water redistribution being a major mechanism increasing productivity in arid zones noy meir 1973 kidron and aloni 2017 it is essential to amass knowledge regarding the potential of biocrust to generate runoff such knowledge may be used for ecosystem managements and agroforestry practices aiming to increase water redistribution and hence hot spots for increased biological activity in desert ecosystems shanan et al 1970 salazar and casanova 2010 5 conclusions various explanations for runoff generation in arid and semiarid regions were suggested including hydrophobicity surface roughness and structure yet to the best of our knowledge none of these mechanisms were experimentally shown to promote runoff generation or specifically linked to data obtained from runoff plots here we show a close link between the viscoelastic properties of crust eps and runoff runoff producing niz crusts were characterized by higher rigidity and elasticity responsible for the increase in crust integrity thus forming a firm mineral grain eps matrix with high whc triggering in turn partial pore clogging ppc and subsequently runoff generation the current findings substantiate the cardinal role played by eps in ppc highlighting not only the importance of the amount of the eps as may be deduced by the ratio of crb to chl but also the viscoelastic properties of the crusts and point to the close link between whc and cs to runoff generation in arid and semiarid regions ppc may trigger runoff and result in water redistribution and subsequently higher productivity in runon zones also used for agroforestry practices declaration

5339,the potential of biocrusts biological soil crusts to generate runoff is a matter of great controversy especially in arid and semiarid regions most authors maintain that runoff in the presence of biocrusts is generated as a result of hydrophobicity crust structure texture or surface roughness hypothesizing that runoff over biocrusts may result from partial pore clogging brought on by extracellular polymeric substances eps we compare two crust types from nizzana in the northwestern negev israel nizid nizpon that readily generate runoff under natural field conditions to a crust type from nizzanim in the southern coast of israel nimid that fails to generate runoff we hypothesize that biocrust induced eps of the niz crusts will have different biochemical and viscoelastic properties than that of nim we conducted sprinkling experiments on the crusts measured the biochemical properties thickness water repellency compressive strength water holding capacity silt and clay content roughness and the adhesion and viscoelastic properties of the crust eps using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d both crusts were not water repellent and were characterized by a relatively smooth surface the niz crusts were however characterized by higher water holding capacity and compressive strength as far as the eps is concerned higher shear viscosity and shear modulus characterized the niz crusts indicating higher crust integrity and rigidity and the formation of durable mineral grain eps matrix of the niz crusts the findings point to a possible link between crust rigidity and runoff coefficients providing supporting evident for the role played by eps in crust formation and runoff generation knowledge regarding the potentiality of runoff and hence water redistribution may assist in ecosystem management and agroforestry practices keywords biological soil crust extracellular polymeric substances infiltration pore clogging negev desert 1 introduction runoff is among the most researched topic in hydrology martinez hernández et al 2017 it determines erosion sedimentation and plant establishment le bissonnais 2016 and serves as an important tool for the study of plant distribution and ecosystem structure and function neilson 1995 runoff generation is especially important in arid regions where saturation of the upper surface skin commonly 1 mm thick hinders infiltration thus resulting in runoff a process known as infiltration excess flow or hortonian overland flow horton 1933 cammeraat 2004 as a result water redistribution takes place providing preferential habitats with enhanced biological activity often used in agroforestry to form loci with high productivity shanan et al 1970 welderufael et al 2012 large areas in arid and semiarid regions are covered in biocrusts also known as biological soil crusts they affect hydrological processes such as evaporation kidron and tal 2012 and runoff kidron and

danin and ganor 1991 biocrusts may increase surface roughness with time and thus hinder runoff generation kidron 2007 or trap dust assumed to enhance runoff generation yair and verrecchia 2002 while runoff is easily generated on fine grained soils whether biocrusts are present or not mualem et al 1990 le bissonnais et al 1995 this is not the case on sand although characterized by high porosity and exhibiting extremely high infiltration rates 300 mm h 1 see lichner et al 2010 runoff production may nevertheless take place on biocrust covered dune sands in sandy subhumid regions runoff was shown to stem from water repellency hydrophobicity attributed to the properties of the crust substances this phenomenon is confined to the beginning of a rain event following a long dry spell rutin 1983 once hitting the ground the water drops ball up wessel 1988 and practically remain on the surface until certain moisture content is reached 3 on sand according to oostindie et al 2013 under these conditions runoff takes place regardless of rain intensity rutin 1983 while substantiated for humid regions the mechanism responsible for runoff generation under arid conditions remains unclear although claimed to take place also in the tabernas desert spain rodriguez caballero et al 2013 water repellency was not reported under natural field conditions and as thoroughly discussed kidron 2019 the expected runoff dynamics high runoff yield during the beginning of the rainy season and regardless of intensity did not coincide with the dynamics described for the tabernas desert no supportive evidence has been provided for two out of the three other mechanisms put forth to explain runoff generation in arid and semiarid zones surface roughness belnap 2006 and structure souza egipsy et al 2002 belnap 2006 felde et al 2014 while acting to reduce the amount of runoff kidron 2007 roughness cannot prevent ponding and runoff initiation kidron et al 2012 and subsequently water flow in preferential water paths i e rills pierson et al 2007 the structure hypothesis claiming that an air gap in between the crust and the subcrust impedes infiltration as suggested for nizzana northwestern negev desert israel has not been supported as an air gap should result in high runoff yield during the beginning of a rain event before the raindrop impact eliminates the air gap however runoff was not produced during the beginning of storms kidron and yair 1997 this leaves the third mechanism the partial pore clogging ppc as the main driver for runoff generation over sandy dunes however there is no consensus surrounding the ppc mechanism and even when adopted controversy exists regarding the factors responsible for surface clogging some attribute ppc to the crust thickness yair 2001 or the fines silt and clay content within the crust yair and verrecchia 2002 others regard the amount and properties of the extra polymeric substances eps primarily consisting of exopolysaccharides as the causal factor for ppc kidron et al 1999 2003 fischer et al 2010 while some scholars insist that eps either does not affect pore clogging felde et al 2016 or even promotes infiltration rossi et al 2012 the relatively fast water adsorption rate and the high adsorption capacity of the eps chenu 1993 or et al 2007 may support rapid ppc subsequently triggering runoff generation verrecchia et al 1995

an important component of most biocrusts it may affect crust elasticity its capability to return to its initial state once a force that is implemented on the crust is removed and rigidity the amount of resistance with which the material opposes change of form both of which may dictate crust coherence and integrity following years of field measurements during which runoff generated in the negev at nizzana niz but failed to generate from the biocrusted surfaces of the israel coast of nizzanim nim we hypothesize that biocrust induced eps of the niz crusts will have different biochemical and viscoelastic properties than that of nim as a result of a successful attempt to evaluate the eps properties with the use of quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d kidron et al 2017 qcm d is employed for the current research for the examination of the crust properties that may affect runoff generation and above all eps properties three types of biocrusts were chosen two of which readily produced runoff under natural rain conditions nizid nizpon and one that failed to produce runoff under natural rain conditions nimid 2 material and methods 2 1 the research sites and previous findings biocrusts were collected from two sandy dunefields the hallamish dunefield near nizzana hereafter niz in the northwestern negev desert and the nizzanim dunefield in the southern coast of israel near ashdod hereafter nim fig 1 a both dunefields receive rain precipitation during the winter months mainly between november and april nevertheless although only 90 km apart they experience different climates aridic in niz and mediterranean in nim bitan and rubin 1991 niz is characterized by long term annual precipitation of 95 mm 1950 1980 rosenan and gilad 1985 with mean precipitation of only 66 5 mm in the last two decades kidron 2015a annual evaporation is 2600 mm evenari 1981 the mean daily annual temperature 1995 2009 in niz is 20 1 c it is 27 1 c during the hottest month of july and 12 0 c during the coldest month of january http www meteo tech co il negev negev daily asp as for nim annual precipitation is 502 mm and annual evaporation is 1500 mm mean maximum daily temperature is 20 1 c it is 26 5 c during the hottest month of july and 12 9 c during the coldest month of january http www ims gov il ims climate climaticatlas tempnormals htm longitudinal dunes 15 20 m high characterize niz the dunes are separated by 50 200 m interdunes fig 1b barchans dunes 15 20 m high with 100 m diameter interdunes characterize nim fig 1c both dunefields have quartzose sand with low amounts 5 7 of silt and clay in both dunefields biocrusts only partially cover the dune slopes mostly the bottom of the slopes and are rare at the crests where wind velocity is too high and surface stability too low to facilitate undisturbed crust growth levin et al 2007 kidron and zohar 2014 the crusts up to several millimeters in thickness cover extensive areas in both interdunes they cover 90 of all sandy surfaces of the niz interdunes and 50 of the surfaces of the nim interdunes levin et al 2007 kidron et al 2010 at nim the interdune crusts reach the highest biomass termed hereafter nimid fig 1d the interdune at niz is characterized by a more complex microtopography while most of the interdune is characterized by relatively smooth 1 1 2 mm thick crusts termed nizid fig 1e small depressions commonly 2 4 m in diameter with a thicker crust are scattered within the interdunes serving as sinks for adjacent runoff kidron 2014 the crust at these depressions termed nizpon exhibit occasional ponding as a result the crusts may roll up giving crusts a unique appearance fig 1f crust species composition is variable cyanobacterial crusts with microcoleus vaginatus and phormidium sp predominate in the interdunes of niz both nizid and nizpon a mixed cyanobacterial and green algal crust characterize nim the nim crust is predominated by microcoleus vaginatus cyanobacteria and klebsormidium sp green algae kidron and büdel 2014 runoff measurements were conducted on both sites during 1990 1994 in niz and during 2005 2008 in nim in both study sites runoff was measured in a pair of 4 6 m2 plots that were constructed over the biocrusted surfaces all runoff was collected in large buckets rain measurements conducted with a tipping bucket rain recorder in one minute niz and 10 minute nim intervals allowed for a thorough analysis of the rain depth intensity frequency and subsequently of the rain runoff relationships while runoff was readily produced in niz even in medium intensities of 9 mm h on sufficiently wet biocrusts no runoff was observed in nim albeit the much higher rain amount 5 fold higher and the higher frequency and longer duration of high rain intensities in nim kidron and büdel 2014 thus 10 min long rain intensities of 9 mm h 1 amounted to 45 2 220 mm of the total rain in nim while amounting to only 13 2 13 mm in niz on average 3 25 runoff events were annually recorded in niz runoff was intermittent in accordance with the intermittent character of the medium and high intensity rain burst with runoff commonly lasting for less than a dozen minutes per rain burst runoff on cyanobacterial crusts increased with the increase in the chlorophyll content of the crust and thus higher runoff yields were obtained from the high chlorophyll north facing cyanobacterial crusts which also had higher amounts of eps kidron et al 2003 higher amounts of runoff were also obtained from the relatively high biomass cyanobacterial crusts that inhabited the small depression of the niz interdune kidron 2014 2 2 field sampling and measurements field sampling and measurements took place in nizid nizpon and nimid during the summer of 2014 field sampling included crusts to measure crust thickness water holding capacity whc compressive strength cs and fine content fc i e silt and clay of crusts additional samples were also collected for sprinkling experiments to determine of the chlorophyll a content hereafter chlorophyll chl and total carbohydrates crb of the crusts and for the examination of the of eps viscoelastic variables rigidity viscosity shear modulus and thickness using qcm d for crust thickness fc whc cs and sprinkling 6 crusted samples were collected from each habitat crust thickness was determined using a caliper as for fc and whc approximately 30 g were collected from each habitat for cs 1 cm thick and 3 cm in diameter crusts were collected and for the sprinkling experiment the upper 5 cm of the crusted soil 5 cm in diameter were collected using a corer all samples were moistened prior to sampling to avoid crust disintegration for chl and crb twelve 1 2 diameter and 1 cm thick samples were collected from each habitat two pairs of six samples 50 g of the upper crusts from each habitat were collected to determine eps properties and a composite sample was created from each pair following the protocol suggested by ying et al 2010 field measurements included crust thickness crust roughness microrelief mr and hydrophobicity using the water drop penetration time test wdpt twelve crusts from each habitat were used to determine the crust thickness using a caliper kidron et al 2010 six randomly chosen loci in each habitat were used for mr measurements the microrelief meter is 18 8 cm long with rods spaced at 3 1 mm apart as described elsewhere kidron 2007 the variance in rod height in absolute values represented roughness sanchez and wood 1987 as for wdpt the test was undertaken under dry wdptdry and wet wdptwet conditions in the field by placing a drop of distilled water on the crust surface a total of 30 drops for each crust and measuring the time that it took for the drop to infiltrate the soil kidron et al 2010 according to this method drop penetration of 60 s indicates severe hydrophobocity drop penetration of 5 60 s indicates moderate hydrophobicity while drop penetration of 5 s indicates lack of hydrobobicity bisdom et al 1993 2 3 lab measurements 2 3 1 measurements of whc cs fc the whc was measured by adding distilled water to a known weight of a dry crust once reaching an equilibrium following 1 h the whc was calculated based on the amount of water that was required to reach complete saturation relative to the dry weight of the crust in accordance with the equation 1 whc wsp ws ws ws 100 where whc water holding capacity wsp weight of soil and water in saturated paste g ws dry weight of soil following oven drying at 105 c g the cs of the crust was measured by a method modified from katznelson 1989 crusts 3 cm in diameter and 1 cm thick were gently placed on a platform with a 1 4 cm diameter opening at its center each crust sample was placed above the opening a 1 2 cm diameter plate connected to a narrow container was placed above the center of the crust water was gently added to the container increasing the pressure of the plate on the crust until it broke crust strength was determined as the total weight of the container plus the amount of water necessary to break the crust kidron et al 2010 the fines content was determined by wet sieving prior to sieving 30 ml of distilled water with 0 5 hexametaphosphate calgon was added to 15 g of soil serving to separate between the clay minerals or clays adsorbed to sand grains and treated for 10 min by ultrasonic waves thereafter the soil was rinsed over a 63 µm mesh and the amount rinsed through the mesh i e the silt and clay 63 µm was weighed őzer and orhan 2015 2 3 2 sprinkling experiments sprinkling experiments were conducted on all three crusts nizid nizpon nimid the experiments were conducted with a mini sprinkler as described by kidron 2007 for sprinkling distilled water at an intensity of 22 5 mm h 1 was used this intensity is within the lower range of high intensity rains that were shown to produce runoff in the negev kidron and yair 1997 each experiment lasted for 15 consecutive minutes which is substantially longer than the consecutive time duration during which high intensity rain spells occur see kidron 2011 and the runoff produced was measured and calculated in millimeters it included the time it took for the water to pond on the surface resulting in crust shininess the time for runoff initiation i e time to runoff ttr and runoff coefficient rc runoff coefficient was calculated in accordance with the equation 2 rc r p 100 where rc runoff coefficient in percent r the amount of runoff obtained ml and p the amount of the precipitated water ml 2 3 3 biochemical properties chl was extracted by hot methanol 70 c 20 min in the presence of mgco3 0 1 w v in sealed test tubes and assayed according to wetzel and westlake 1969 after the extraction of the chlorophyll the samples were used for carbohydrate crb determination by the anthrone method hassid and abraham 1957 in addition to chl and crb of the crusts the biochemical properties of the eps were also evaluated first the eps were extracted from the crusts samples and analyzed by a fixation step the analysis included the addition of 0 22 formaldehyde followed by the addition of 1 n sodium hydroxide to facilitate the dissociation of the acidic groups in the eps to the solution liu and fang 2002 the suspension was thereafter centrifuged 20 000 g 15 min 4 c filtered through a 0 22 μm hydrophilic nylon filter millipore co and dialyzed through a dialysis membrane of 3500 da spectra por polysaccharide and protein contents in the eps were analyzed colorimetrically according to dubois et al 1956 and bradford 1977 methods respectively 2 3 4 eps adhesion tests with qcm d eps adherence and viscoelastic properties were analyzed during adsorption to silica coated crystals in a qcm d for at least two independent adsorption experiments dissolved eps samples were filtered through a 0 22 µm hydrophilic pvdf filter and thereafter set to concentration of 25 mg l as dissolved organic carbon doc in 100 mm nacl background solution by providing real time measurements of molecular absorption and or interactions which takes place on the quartz crystals the qcm d provides essential information such as the structural properties of the adsorbed layers of the interaction between microorganism derived eps and the sand grains nguyen and elimelech 2007 obtaining similar results one set of experimental data is presented in this study the qcm d measurements were performed with at cut quartz crystals mounted in an e4 system biolin scientific q sense the crystals coated with the amorphous silica have a fundamental resonance frequency of 5 mhz kwon et al 2006 before each measurement the crystals were soaked in 5 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta solution for 30 min rinsed thoroughly with double distilled water dried with pure n2 gas and treated for 10 min in a uv o3 bioforce nanoscience chamber using a digital peristaltic pump operating in sucking mode all qcm d experiments were performed under flow through conditions of 150 µl min prior to each of the qcm d experiments and after cleaning the crystals a baseline with distilled water was acquired in order to analyze the effects of crust origin on associated eps adsorption eps thickness and viscoelastic properties three solutions were injected sequentially to the qcm d system in the following order i 100 mm nacl background solution ii dissolved eps in 100 mm nacl at concentration of 25 mg l as doc iii 100 mm nacl in accordance with a protocol reported by ying et al 2010 frequency variations δf hz and dissipation factors δd were measured for three overtones n 5 7 and 9 the viscoelastic properties of the eps layers were calculated based on the voigt model according to voinova et al 1999 the density and viscosity of the solution used in this model were 1 g cm3 and 10 3 pa s respectively following the recommendations of gurdak et al 2005 the density of the adsorbed layer was fixed at 1 030 g cm3 for the receipt of the best fitting values of the shear viscosity η shear modulus μ and voigt thickness dvoigt of the adsorbed layer modeling the experimental data of δf and δd for three overtones was undertaken for this end we used the q tools biolin scientific q sense 2 4 statistical analysis in order to compare the values of the different variables one way anova tests and bonferroni post hoc test were applied using spss version 11 il chicago usa except for mr where we first applied transformation square root to obtain a distribution close to normal the perquisites of normality and homogeneity of variances were met for all other variables therefore allowing for the use of original values simple t tests were conducted to examine the relationships between biochemical properties and runoff coefficient differences were regarded significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 biochemical properties crust thickness wdpt mr fc chl crb and species composition of the three crust types are shown in table 1 while whc cs and the ratio of crb to chl are shown in fig 2 except for non significant differences of wdptdry and chl for nizpon and nimid cs for nizid and nizpon and mr for all crusts all other variables exhibited significant differences among the crusts although wdptdry was significantly higher for nizpon and nimid all values fell below 5 s indicating that all crusts were hydrophilic rather than hydrophobic as for mr the crusts did not exhibit significant differences with all crusts exhibiting a relatively smooth surface crust thickness showed however a clear pattern with nimid nizpon nizid on the other hand nimid exhibited the lowest fc following the pattern nizpon nizid nimid yet nimid exhibited the highest chl with nimid nizpon nizid crb was higher in nizpon and followed the pattern nizpon nizid nimid as for whc cs and the ratio of crb to chl a clear pattern is shown with nizpon nizid nimid yet cs and the ratio of crb to chl were only significantly different between both niz crusts and nimid indicating higher eps and higher strength for the niz crusts 3 2 sprinkling experiments no runoff was produced by nimid runoff was however produced by nizid and nizpon with nizpon yielding significantly higher amounts than nizid this can be seen in fig 3 that shows representative graphs and fig 4 a and 4b that show the average amount of time that took the crusts to produce runoff time to runoff ttr and the average value of runoff coefficient rc respectively both niz crusts nizpon and nizid reached saturation within 3 5 min since the onset of the sprinkling experiment as reflected by the crust shininess with ttr lagging behind between 5 and 15 min runoff could not have been explained by hydrophobicity nor by the crust biomass chlorophyll or thickness the thickest crust and the crust with the highest biomass nimid failed to yield runoff 3 3 eps fig 5 shows the properties of the eps which were extracted from the three crust types nizpon exhibited the highest values of doc tn and ps but not of pr which was the highest at nimid overall as far as the eps is concerned the ratios of ps to pr were higher for the niz crusts especially for nizpon additional information on the eps was obtained by the qcm d the capability of the eps to attach to the silica coated sensor of the qcm d is reflected by the frequency shift δf and by the dissipation factor i e the loss of energy as reflected by δd fig 6 a 6b the eps of the niz crusts showed much higher capability to attach to the sensor as indicated by the higher decrease of the frequency shift δf and higher loss of energy δd caused by the eps of the niz crusts in comparison to that of the nim crust the high ratio of δd δf exhibit in accordance with the voigt model nguyen and elimelech 2007 orgad et al 2011 elevated energy loss per oscillation frequency due to adsorption of eps of the niz crusts providing additional indication for the elevation in the eps viscoelasticity of the eps of the niz crusts fig 7 a fig 7b and 7c show higher viscosity and shear modulus of the eps of the niz crusts additionally the eps of the niz crusts exhibited a much thicker hydrated layer fig 7d which may all provide the niz crusts higher integrity and more rigid aggregates 3 4 relationships between biochemical variables and runoff coefficient given the small number of crust types the contribution of a statistical analysis is obviously limited nevertheless it may provide supporting evidence regarding the role played by the different variables when linear correlations were sought no significant relationships were found between rc and crust thickness hydrophobicity mr fc chl and crb three of the variables exhibited significant relationships cs r 2 0 88 p 0 018 whc r 2 0 99 p 0 012 and the ratio of crb to chl r 2 0 98 p 0 045 4 discussion sprinkling experiments showed high variability while produced by the niz crusts runoff was not produced by the nim crust as for niz substantially higher amounts were obtained from nizpon in comparison to nizid in agreement with two year long field measurements kidron 2014 the higher amounts obtained by the nizpon crusts in comparison to the nizid crusts were in agreement with previous findings that showed a close link between the biomass of cyanobacterial crusts and runoff yield kidron et al 2003 yet albeit the higher chl of nimid no runoff was produced by the nim crust this was in agreement with field measurements from nim which did not record any runoff during three years of consecutive measurements kidron and büdel 2014 the findings could not have been explained by hydrophobicity or mr both exhibiting similar values in all crusts or by the thickness all of which exhibited non significant relationships with rc thus the thickest crust nimid failed to produce runoff as for cs whc and ratio of crb to chl all yielded significant relationships with rc and as will be outlined below all are linked to the eps as for fc while it may increase the compressive strength of the crusts no significant relationship was found between fc and rc moreover detailed experiments could not support its cardinal role in pore clogging of the biocrustal surfaces this issue was thoroughly explored in a previous research during which sprinkling experiments on moss dominated crusts with high fc 39 1 did not yield higher runoff in comparison to cyanobacterial crusts having only half the amount 15 4 of fc kidron 2015b this was accounted for by the very low amount of expanding 2 1 clays such as montmorillonite within the fc felde et al 2018 the very minor effect of fines on runoff generation was also supported under natural field conditions on scalped cyanobacterial crusts runoff was readily produced on the scalped plots during the beginning of the third year despite the meager amounts of dust fines that accumulated on these plots kidron 2007 extensive measurements of runoff over biocrusts in the negev kidron 1999 kidron et al 2003 the israeli mediterranean coast kidron and büdel 2014 and the chihuahuan desert kidron et al 2012 pointed to the cardinal role played by ppc in runoff generation in previous publications this was explained by the high correlation between rc and the ratio of crb to chl and supported by sem pictographs thus while showing copious amounts of eps in the niz crusts which readily yielded runoff kidron et al 2003 eps was hardly noted in the nim crusts kidron and büdel 2014 and in the crusts from the white sands national monument in the chihuahuan desert kidron et al 2012 both of which exhibited low ratios of crb to chl both these crusts failed to yield runoff during 3 and 5 years of consecutive field measurements respectively a low ratio of crb to chl also characterizes nimid during the current research thus in comparison to a crb chl ratio of 341 0 and 240 4 for nizpon and nizid respectively it was only 83 7 for nimid yet contrary to previous analyses during which only the ratio crb to chl was evaluated the current research focuses on the relevant properties of the eps which may determine whether or not ppc may take place this is indicated by the high doc and ps of the niz crusts while the close link between rc and the ratios of ps pr is not yet clear fig 5e a possible link between the high adsorption capacity of carbohydrates or et al 2007 and the high rc cannot be ruled out altogether as verified by the high whc exhibited by the niz crusts the eps of the niz crusts showed high adsorption capability it exhibited also high elasticity and viscosity the higher elevation of the viscoelasticity of the niz crusts is indicated by the higher rigidity of the crust as noted by the loss of energy δd per oscillation cycle δf of the qcm d sensor caused by the adsorption of eps of the niz crusts the higher viscosity and elasticity as well as the higher hydrated thickness also point to the higher integrity and coherence of the niz crusts ying et al 2010 apparently responsible for the formation of firm mineral grain eps matrix this may explain the higher compressive strength of the niz crusts additionally the eps of the niz crusts exhibited a much thicker hydrated layer implying higher capability of water adsorption higher water adsorption may also be linked to the amount of eps i e to the high ratio of crb to chl this will result in higher capability of these crusts to adsorb water as reflected indeed in the higher whc of the niz crusts all the above properties rigidity elasticity viscosity and the greater hydrated thickness of the eps should greatly affect pore clogging and subsequently runoff the high elasticity of the eps as also indicated by the high cs of the niz crusts is likely to prevent crust fragility and subsequently water entry through cracks similarly the high viscosity and the higher hydrated thickness along with the higher eps may facilitate higher water adsorption as also indicated by the higher whc of the niz crusts all three variables the ratio crb to chl whc cs yielded indeed significant relationships with rc with eps exhibiting high water adsorption chenu 1993 or et al 2007 high amounts of eps of the niz crusts as deduced from the high ratio of crb to chl may imply that the niz crusts are likely to readily swell resulting in ppc which under sufficient rain intensity will generate runoff kidron et al 2003 2012 in addition to the overall higher amounts of eps some properties of the eps such as elasticity viscosity and the greater hydrated thickness may further enhance the capability of the biocrust to adsorb water and thus to increase ppc as previously suggested kidron et al 2003 2012 kidron and büdel 2014 the amounts and properties of the eps are species dependent one should note that the crust types that did not yield runoff that of the southern coast of israel and that of the white sands national monument usa had a high proportion of green algae which as evident by the sem pictographs kidron and büdel 2014 exhibited only low amounts of eps our results are not in agreement with some of the models suggested in the literature contrary to views that maintain that runoff is determined by roughness and is not linked to species composition belnap 2006 our results indicate that a even smooth crusts like nimid did not produce runoff and therefore roughness could not have been regarded as responsible for runoff and b that the amounts and properties of the eps are determined by species composition as also found elsewhere guan and cao 2019 moreover contrary to the view that eps increase infiltration rossi et al 2012 or is not involved in ppc felde et al 2016 the current findings point to the cardinal role played by the eps in increasing crust rigidity and decreasing infiltration felde et al 2016 examined crusts in a dry state and concluded that the similar volume of the crusts point to the fact that the crust eps does not take part in ppc this conclusion is however problematic under field conditions eps will reduce pore clogging only under wet conditions and subsequently water adsorption field conditions were also not mimicked by rossi et al 2012 rossi et al 2012 used edta to extract the eps from the crust thereafter measuring the infiltration within petri dishes with mini disc tension infiltrometer in the lab as confirmed during our research not only may eps properties differ among crusts not necessarily impeding infiltration as was the case in nimid but the use of different chemicals in test preparation may change the viscoelastic properties of the crust erto et al 2010 more et al 2014 and therefore may affect water adsorption and subsequently pore clogging our findings also show that in addition to different principally optic methods currently used to study the eps properties wu et al 2009 qcm d may also serve as an additional tool to characterize the adhesion and the mechanical properties of eps layers moreover as previously indicated flemming and wingender 2001 the findings point to the cardinal role played by eps in determining the structure and function of biocrusts our findings substantiate the use of the amount of eps as deduced by the ratio of total carbohydrates to that of protein or chlorophyll content to serve as a proxy indicator of crust runoff production moreover due to the close link between runoff coefficient and whc and cs the possible use of both whc and cs as indicators for runoff generation should also be explored for arid and semiarid zones understanding the driving mechanism for hortonian overland flow over biocrusts is imperative with runoff over biocrusts playing a central role in water redistribution kidron 1999 and with water redistribution being a major mechanism increasing productivity in arid zones noy meir 1973 kidron and aloni 2017 it is essential to amass knowledge regarding the potential of biocrust to generate runoff such knowledge may be used for ecosystem managements and agroforestry practices aiming to increase water redistribution and hence hot spots for increased biological activity in desert ecosystems shanan et al 1970 salazar and casanova 2010 5 conclusions various explanations for runoff generation in arid and semiarid regions were suggested including hydrophobicity surface roughness and structure yet to the best of our knowledge none of these mechanisms were experimentally shown to promote runoff generation or specifically linked to data obtained from runoff plots here we show a close link between the viscoelastic properties of crust eps and runoff runoff producing niz crusts were characterized by higher rigidity and elasticity responsible for the increase in crust integrity thus forming a firm mineral grain eps matrix with high whc triggering in turn partial pore clogging ppc and subsequently runoff generation the current findings substantiate the cardinal role played by eps in ppc highlighting not only the importance of the amount of the eps as may be deduced by the ratio of crb to chl but also the viscoelastic properties of the crusts and point to the close link between whc and cs to runoff generation in arid and semiarid regions ppc may trigger runoff and result in water redistribution and subsequently higher productivity in runon zones also used for agroforestry practices declaration
