4190,physical modelling of urban flooding usually considers that the flow is concentrated in the streets assuming that urban blocks and individual buildings are non porous structures this assumption is open to criticism as potential lateral flow exchanges through openings in the walls of an urban block e g gates windows and doors are likely to modify the flow pattern in the block and adjacent streets this paper reports an experimental study conducted on a 5 4 m long and 3 2 m wide physical model representing a rectangular urban block and four surrounding streets the focus of the study was on investigating the lateral flow exchange processes between the porous urban block and its adjacent streets during flooding for a variable urban block porosity eight porosity values were studied keeping the same boundary conditions a porosity equals zero i e a flow around a non porous block served as a reference flow situation for each porosity value the impact of the lateral flow exchanges on the spatial distribution of flow depth and velocity in the streets and within the block was assessed as well as the risk to pedestrians first it was found that in the streets surrounding the block flow depth and depth averaged velocity can vary by 12 and 70 respectively when modifying block porosity within the block the most impacted flow parameter is the number and size of horizontal secondary flow cells second noticeable differences in flow depth can be observed from either side of an opening between street and block third when moving away from the block flow parameters are little affected last the risk to pedestrians which is both related to local flow depth and velocity is dependent on the block porosity value keywords laboratory experiment urban flood risk wall porosity lspiv technique 1 introduction according to unisdr et al 2015 flood events increased by 39 from 2004 to 2013 with respect to the previous decade the damage to goods and people caused by these events is particularly significant in urban settlements mainly because of the high population density and the value of assets as reported by united nations et al 2019 the number of people living in urban areas worldwide is increasing and it is estimated that by 2050 it will be the case for two thirds of the world s population therefore developing methodologies to assess the urban flood hazard and the associated risk with higher precision is particularly relevant flood hazard is usually described by flow depth flood extent flow velocity flood wave propagation flood duration and the water s rising rate de moel et al 2009 among these the most common parameters are the local velocity and flow depth used for the prediction of building damage e g jakob et al 2012 lo et al 2012 maiwald and schwarz

urban flood studies are more often conducted to quantify the spatial distribution of velocity and flow depth to establish flood hazard and risk maps e g chen et al 2019 costabile et al 2020 galuppini et al 2020 however studying flood events in an urban environment remains a challenge because it requires incorporating various topographical details in the flooding model e g buildings street furniture and vehicles sewage system subway and the latter must account for the complex interplay between flow and topographical and hydraulic singularities e g interaction with fixed and mobile obstacles streets sewer network or streets buildings flow exchanges among the tools used to study these events numerical modelling is the most widely used method especially two dimensional 2 d modelling e g mignot et al 2006 soares frazão et al 2008 el kadi abderrezzak et al 2009 guinot 2012 bazin et al 2017 since i flows within the urban area are too complex for 1 d models ii the involved horizontal geometrical length scales are often large compared to flow depths and iii studies using 3 d modelling demand a high computational cost paquier et al 2019 however the scarcity of detailed and reliable data on real world urban flood events represents a drawback to the calibration and validation of these models macchione et al 2019 in this context laboratory physical models are a convenient alternative especially useful for investigating flow patterns in complex geometries under controlled conditions finaud guyot et al 2018 they can provide reliable information and detailed observations at local scale and can also be used as a benchmark tool for the calibration of numerical models although real world urban blocks and individual buildings include openings e g doors windows gates fences and interior spaces e g gardens courtyards parking lots most experimental urban flood studies consider them as non porous structures through which the flow cannot enter e g ishigaki 2003 araud et al 2014 finaud guyot et al 2018 however to the best of the authors knowledge no study has proved that the impact of the exchanges between the street network and urban blocks on the flow characteristics is negligible and accordingly has to be discarded in general terms very few studies are dedicated to the flows entering buildings during floods except for the study of zhou et al 2016 who represented buildings as square aligned and staggered obstacles over a plain with square open windows and the study of sturm et al 2018 who represented them as real world building shapes over a floodplain with open windows and doors as the lateral flow exchanges between urban blocks and streets have been little studied we took a closer look on these physical processes based on a laboratory experiment it was conducted using a tilting physical model termed muri maquette urbaine pour l étude du risque d inondation i e urban model for the study of flood risk at the hydraulics and hydro morphology laboratory of inrae centre lyon villeurbanne france fig 1 a the focus was on the exchanges between one single porous urban block and four adjacent streets fig 1b and c the openings in the urban block walls stand for wide gates eight values of porosity were studied including a reference flow situation with a porosity equal to zero the main aim was to assess the impact of a variable block porosity on flow depths velocities and flow patterns in the streets and block and on the lateral discharges through each opening risk maps for pedestrians in the streets and block were then deduced from the flood hazard assessment section 2 outlines the experimental methodology including the description of the physical model the measurement techniques the flow cases studied and the flood risk criterion for pedestrians section 3 reports the impact of porosity on the measured flow features water depth and velocity exchange discharges horizontal secondary flow cells section 4 discusses its impact on the related flood risk to pedestrians inside the block and in the neighbouring streets the main conclusions are eventually drawn in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 experimental set up the physical model for the study of flood risk is a 5 4 m long and 3 8 m wide rectangular tilting platform which comprises three longitudinal streets and three transverse streets and represents an urban district fig 1a for this study the working zone was reduced to 5 4 m 3 2 m focusing on a single 1 56 m long and 0 96 m wide rectangular block and four surrounding streets upstream downstream right and left of equal width b 0 15 m fig 1b and c with two discharge inlets upstream end of the right and left streets and 4 discharge outlets downstream end of all streets the sidewalls of the block and streets are made of transparent plastic and the platform bed is made of grey pvc the model bed slope in the longitudinal direction aligned with the x axis s 0 x was set at 0 12 and the slope in the lateral direction aligned with the y axis s 0 y equals zero no building or furniture was placed within the block to maximize any potential flow through it the porosity of the urban block walls was varied by changing the number of openings along them with a maximum of three in each wall each opening was 6 cm wide and 8 cm high and the free surface flow always remained below the opening top the total inlet discharge q in t 6 5 ls 1 was partitioned between the inflow in the right street q in 1 4 5 ls 1 and left street q in 2 2 0 ls 1 as shown in fig 1c each inlet discharge was adjusted with an independent valve flowmeter system with a standard error of 3 of the flow rate a honeycomb plastic grid was placed at the entrance of each street to straighten out the flow at the outlet of each street the flow fell into an outlet tank the outlet discharge was then monitored using an electromagnetic flowmeter optiflux 2000 by krohne the four outlet discharges are denoted as q out 1 q out 2 q out 3 and q out 4 as depicted in fig 1c at the downstream end of each street a vertical tail weir enables flow depths in the street network to be controlled in the present study the weir heights were set to get a higher flow depth in the right street than in the left street making easier a transverse flow through the porous block the weir height w 4 cm at outlet 1 while w 3 cm at outlets 2 3 and 4 the scale ratio in the horizontal plane λ xy equals 50 and the vertical scale ratio λ z equals 10 the model then represents in the real world an urban block of 78 0 m 48 0 m and 7 5 m wide streets with 3 m wide gates and flow depths of about 0 60 m this difference in scale ratios leads to a distorted scale model with a distortion ratio λ xy λ z 5 which ensures i greater flow depths allowing greater accuracy during measurements and ii larger reynolds numbers improving the dynamic similarity with the prototype chanson 2004 2 2 measuring techniques to answer all questions raised in section 1 the measuring devices had to be set to assess i the flow depth fields in streets and within the urban block ii the discharge within each street reach iii the discharge entering or leaving the urban block through each opening and iv the velocity field over the whole measuring domain following subsections detail the corresponding measurement methods 2 2 1 flow depth the 2 d field of flow depth d was obtained using an ultrasonic distance measuring sensor us with a resolution better than 0 3 mm and reproducibility better than 0 5 mm baumer undk 20i6914 s35a the estimated flow depth uncertainty equals 0 65 mm the us is fixed on a mechanical gantry system moving along both longitudinal x axis and transverse y axis directions each measurement was taken at a sampling rate of 50 hz for 50 s time convergence tests were carried out to define the appropriate acquisition duration see appendix a 1 for more details the spatial interval between two measurements in the streets was equal to 5 0 cm and 6 5 cm in the streamwise and spanwise directions 3 measurements in the street cross section respectively and to 12 0 cm along both directions within the urban block 2 2 2 velocity the flow velocity in the water column was measured using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv with a side looking probe nortek vectrino its accuracy is 0 5 of the measured value the three instantaneous velocity components u x u y u z were measured at each point at a sampling rate of 100 hz for 100 s in the streets and 200 s within the urban block these acquisition durations were defined based on time convergence tests of the adv signal under various flow conditions as presented in appendix a 2 water was seeded with polyamide particles vestosint with an average particle diameter of 55 μm to increase the signal to noise ratio the winadv software was used to process the adv raw data including a filtering step based on the despiking technique proposed by goring and nikora 2002 the sampling standard errors for the time averaged local velocity components u x u y and u z are 0 20 cms 1 0 4 0 06 cms 1 1 5 and 0 10 cms 1 3 7 respectively in the streets these errors were estimated based on 20 times series of 100 s each at the same measuring point at three different locations and 0 13 cms 1 2 0 0 05 cms 1 23 3 and 0 04 cms 1 10 5 respectively within the urban block 20 times series of 200 s at one location the surface velocity in the streets and within the block was measured using the large scale particle image velocimetry technique lspiv in previous studies this technique proved to be reliable for a laboratory use e g muste et al 2000 kantoush et al 2011 being able to accurately measure small velocities in shallow depth flows meselhe et al 2004 and to properly distinguish large scale and small scale flow structures fujita et al 1998 wood shavings with diameters ranging from 1 to 4 mm were used as free surface tracers this light and pale material sharply contrasted with the dark grey colour of the model bed a video camera panasonic hc v770 was placed 2 8 m above the experimental set up with the optical axis perpendicular to the model bed the spatial resolution of the camera was 1920 px 1080 px with a recording rate of 25 frames per second in addition to natural light four led lamps with an adjustable light intensity were used along with light diffusion screens to light up the set up the free fudaa lspiv software co developed by edf inrae was used to process the videos and compute the time averaged surface velocities the required recording duration was 60 s see time convergence tests of the 2 d distribution of time averaged velocity in appendix a 3 for more details it should be mentioned that seeding the flow at only one location to measure surface velocities over the entire domain was found to be inappropriate in this case a large seeding generates clogging in small velocity areas and along the main streets while a limited seeding does not deliver sufficient tracers in the upstream transverse street and within the urban block the best procedure arising from preliminary tests was actually to perform various videos with different seeding locations for a given flow case a procedure only possible under steady flow conditions seeding the flow at the entrance of the right and left streets a first video recorded the tracer movements in the right left and downstream streets seeding at the entrance of the upstream street a second video recorded the tracers in this street last seeding the flow near the block openings on the street side a third video was taken to measure surface velocity within the urban block application of the lspiv technique was then performed in each of these three areas independently and the resulting surface velocities were finally plotted on the same map the agreement in velocity magnitude and velocity direction at the intersections of the three zones gave confidence in the quality of the surface velocity measurement finally to validate the surface velocity results the velocity measured by lspiv was compared to adv velocity two types of adv velocity data were considered here near surface velocities and depth averaged velocities within the block the fair agreement of the lspiv velocities with these two types of adv velocity data proves that flow is mainly two dimensional see fig b 16 in appendix b in the streets although velocity magnitude and recirculating flow areas are adequately captured by lspiv the results in some areas near the crossroads appear to be less accurate mainly due to the presence of strong flow depth variations in addition the slight decrease in velocity when approaching the walls in some areas was not observed either see fig b 17 in appendix b overall the velocities obtained with the lspiv technique in the streets are slightly lower than the near surface adv data mainly due to the clogging of the tracers a video of the tracers motion used for lspiv is available as supplementary material 2 2 3 discharge the flow velocity within the water column was measured at 9 to 10 elevations depending on flow depth and at 15 lateral positions across the wetted area in a street the discharge in a street reach was then computed by integrating the adv velocity data across the street as follows 1 q st 0 b 0 d u x d z d y for x axis oriented streets and 2 q st 0 b 0 d u y d z d x for y axis oriented streets where q st is the discharge in the street reach u x and u y are the local time averaged velocity components along the x axis and y axis respectively we should keep in mind that the inlet and outlet discharges were measured using electromagnetic flowmeters then based on the mass conservation law at each crossroad and each opening the number of cross sections over which the discharge had to be computed by eqs 1 and 2 from the adv data was set just sufficient to assess the discharge within each street reach and through each opening additional cross sectional adv measurements were performed to compute discharges with eqs 1 and 2 and verify that they were in agreement with discharges obtained using the mass conservation law while the velocity field was measured as close as possible from the bed lateral walls and free surface areas along all four boundaries of a street cross section remained blind with no available velocity measurement to estimate the discharge using eqs 1 and 2 an extrapolation of the measured velocity field was thus required with a slip boundary condition applied at the free surface and the average between slip and no slip boundary conditions applied along the bed and lateral walls for more details see appendix c finally it should be reminded that the estimate of the discharge at a given cross section in a street network remains a challenging task even though innovative techniques tend to arise finaud guyot et al 2019 preliminary tests were conducted to compare the discharge estimated by eqs 1 and 2 with the discharges measured by the electromagnetic flowmeters located upstream of the inlet tanks and downstream of the outlet tanks obtaining an average error of 1 5 therefore although the method requires assumptions to cover the blind zones near the boundaries bed walls and free surface as well as the inconvenience of using an intrusive instrument adv in a narrow cross section the results seem to be fairly reliable 2 3 flow conditions and experimental cases the experiments were conducted under steady flow conditions and subcritical regime the hydraulic boundary conditions i e inflow discharges and heights of the tail weirs were kept constant from one porosity value to another the porosity along each wall was defined as 3 ψ n l op l i i x y where ψ is the wall porosity n is the number of openings along the wall l op is the length of the opening and l i is the total length of the wall oriented in direction i the flow cases and the associated porosity values are reported in table 1 only symmetrical distributions of the wall porosity were considered the same value along the right and left streets and the same along the upstream and downstream streets the case c00 00 with a non porous block as mostly considered by previous works in the literature serves as a reference flow situation the extreme case c100 100 without urban block represents an urban configuration of a main square in between a small porosity a single opening along a wall and a large porosity three openings along a wall are both studied with six cases featuring the same porosity along face to face walls along x axis direction c00 04 and 00 12 y axis direction c06 00 and c19 00 and finally along both directions c06 04 and c19 12 2 4 risk criterion for pedestrians for each flow case the local flow depth and depth averaged velocity together hazard with the vulnerability of pedestrians to flooding enable the risk level to be assessed the vulnerability was determined based on the product number pn ud where u is the depth averaged velocity magnitude and d the flow depth over the past 50 years several studies have been conducted with real people to estimate their threshold of instability in flood flows e g foster and cox 1973 takahashi et al 1992 karvonen et al 2000 jonkman and penning rowsell 2008 russo et al 2013 martínez gomariz et al 2016 with real people and using a concrete monolith representing a real size person e g abt et al 1989 using scale models e g xia et al 2014a which is a more conservative approach that may well represent the lower limit of people s stability or by observations made during real flood events e g milanesi et al 2016 the results of each study showed a significant scatter and this was of course expected as the instability threshold can be influenced by many parameters defining human beings e g the weight height age strength skills psychological characteristics as well as the test conditions e g experimental set up protective equipment clothing of subjects and methodology e g subject standing or walking criteria for instability carried out in the various studies cox et al 2010 proposed vulnerability curves based on people instability data sets available at that time however in the last 10 years additional studies have been carried out mainly exploring conditions of instability in shallow flow with high velocities common during floods in urban areas e g russo et al 2013 xia et al 2014a martínez gomariz et al 2016 these studies as well as experiences acquired and observations made by chanson et al 2014 suggest that the people s instability in urban areas during floods begins at lower flow depths and velocities than those reported in previous studies therefore following a procedure similar to that performed by cox et al 2010 a new criterion of risk to pedestrian during flooding in urban areas is proposed based on the available experimental data and field observations on people s instability and on various guidelines for the safety of people during flooding three product number thresholds are proposed first pn 0 3 m2 s 1 defines the lower limit of people s stability according to xia et al 2014a and abt et al 1989 results obtained using the concrete monolith up to d 0 7 m based on the curve for critical self evacuation proposed by ishigaki et al 2009 and up to u 2 0 ms 1 based on the limit of people s stability at small flow depths found by russo et al 2013 and martínez gomariz et al 2016 second pn 0 7 m2 s 1 is the upper limit of xia et al 2014a results and where the first signs of people s instability begin for studies conducted by abt et al 1989 takahashi et al 1992 and karvonen et al 2000 up to d 0 95 m and up to u 2 7 ms 1 which represents approximately the mid point in the range of velocities found for people instability at small flow depths found by russo et al 2013 and martínez gomariz et al 2016 and third pn 1 0 m2 s 1 corresponds to approximately the 50 limit of instability cases of the total data set up to d 1 2 m proposed by cox et al 2010 being the largest flow depth tested in the available data series and up to u 3 5 ms 1 which is approximately the upper limit of people s stability at shallow flow according to russo et al 2013 and martínez gomariz et al 2016 i e above this limit almost all pedestrians exhibit instability all these vulnerability curves are shown in the flood risk diagram for pedestrians in fig 2 and they define four flood risk levels which are as follows low very few pedestrians exhibit instability up to 2 of the total data set moderate some pedestrians exhibit instability up to 20 of the total data set significant many pedestrians exhibit instability up to 50 of the total data set high most pedestrians exhibit instability above 50 of total data set the estimate of the local level of risk for pedestrians requires to firstly pass the results from the physical model scale to the real world prototype scale using froude similarity fr m fr p chanson 2004 heller 2011 the following ratios are obtained 4 u p u m λ z 1 2 for velocity 5 d p d m λ z for flow depth where subscripts m and p refer to the model and the prototype respectively 3 measured flow features 3 1 flow depth fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of flow depth d in the streets and urban block for all cases putting aside the case without block c100 100 the flow depth ranges from 5 cm to 7 5 cm 0 50 m 0 75 m in the prototype for all flow cases the largest flow depths are observed in the right street due to both the high inflow discharge in this street and the backwater effect due to the 4 cm high tail weir located at the outlet of this street fig 1c inside the urban block as the free surface is almost horizontal the flow depth slightly increases along the x axis due to the longitudinal bed slope of the model interestingly the flow depth within the urban block can differ from the flow depth in the adjacent streets in the right street the flow depth is higher than in the block up to 10 at x 3 25 m for cases with a porosity along the upstream and downstream block walls only i e cases c06 00 and c19 00 in contrast the flow depth can be smaller in the downstream street than in the block e g by 14 at y 0 30 m for cases with a porosity along the right and left block walls only c00 04 and c00 12 fig 4 shows the relative difference in flow depth δ d for each case with respect to the reference case c00 00 defined as 6 δ d d d ref d ref 100 where d ref refers to the flow depth of the reference case c00 00 in the streets surrounding the urban block the relative difference in flow depth δ d can reach up to 7 in the right street and 12 5 in the downstream street case c19 12 in contrast when moving away from the block flow depths in the street reaches located upstream and downstream of the block for x 2 94 m x 4 80 m and y 1 26 m do not show significant variations with respect to the reference case with a maximum of 3 5 case c19 00 3 2 discharges and bulk velocity in the streets fig 5 shows an overview of the discharges in the streets and urban block for all cases the inlet and outlet discharges monitored by electromagnetic flowmeters are indicated by shaded boxes the discharges computed using eqs 1 and 2 are highlighted in purple and the discharges computed from the mass conservation equation are highlighted in orange colour in the middle of the block the intrusion discharge is highlighted in pink obtained as the average between the sum of discharges entering green arrows and leaving red arrows the block along with the corresponding uncertainty this uncertainty includes the errors coming from the measuring instruments electromagnetic flowmeter and adv and from the discharge computation method due to additional adv measurements several error values can be obtained in all cases the maximum value obtained is about 1 of the total inlet discharge and this is the one shown in all the cases in fig 5 all the discharge values are shown as a percentage of the total inlet discharge q in t 6 5 ls 1 in the streets the direction of the flow is the same for all cases i e from upstream to downstream in the two longitudinal streets and from right to left in the two transverse streets in contrast the direction of the exchange flow through the openings may vary from one case to another regarding the discharge magnitude when using case c00 00 as a reference flow situation fig 5 shows that the change in porosity i significantly affects the discharges in the streets surrounding the urban block ii significantly affects the discharge entering the block which logically increases with an increasing porosity and iii hardly alters the outlet discharges putting aside the extreme case without block c100 100 the relative differences in discharge in the streets with respect to the reference flow case δ q st are shown in fig 6 they are computed at the upstream end of the four surrounding streets the relative difference δ q st increases with block porosity for instance for cases c00 04 and c00 12 δ q st 40 and 70 in the upstream street δ q st 21 and 36 in the left street and δ q st 6 to 10 in the right street respectively the same tendency is observed when comparing cases c06 00 and c19 00 or cases c06 04 and c19 12 the exchange discharges through the block openings also increase with the porosity see fig 7 however no tendency arises for the intrusion discharge as a function of the porosity for instance if we compare three pairs of cases where the porosity is increased by 200 the increase in discharge is 78 from c00 04 to c00 12 240 from c06 00 to c19 00 and 70 from c06 04 to c19 12 it is also interesting to investigate the influence of the porosity distribution for a fixed total number of openings along the block walls for two openings cases c00 04 and c06 00 fig 7 indicates that the discharge through the urban block is greater by approximately 90 with openings in the right and left walls than with openings in the upstream and downstream walls however for six openings when comparing cases c00 12 and c19 00 the discharge through the urban block is practically the same hence the exchange discharge between streets and block does not depend only on the porosity value this is a more complex process depending on the location of the openings the flow orientation through these openings the flow circulation within the block and flow depths and discharges in the surrounding streets finally when moving away from the block the outlet discharges are hardly affected by a change in porosity the flow distribution among the four outlets is rather constant from one case to another when putting aside the extreme case without block c100 100 as shown at the top right of fig 5 the maximum variation with respect to the reference case remains limited to around 2 to verify whether this was due to the imposed weir heights additional experiments were conducted for detailed information see appendix d by changing the hydraulic boundary conditions inflow discharge distribution between left and right streets and the height of the weirs and the longitudinal and transverse slopes the results obtained are similar as in the main experiment the urban block porosity does not significantly change the discharge distribution among the four outlets the latter is mainly driven by the presence of the urban block irrespective of the porosity value of its walls the bulk velocities in the streets for the six cases with a porous block are now compared with those of the reference case fig 8 shows the relative difference in bulk velocity δ u x b and δ u y b as appropriate for all the streets in the streets surrounding the block the bulk velocities considerably vary with respect to the reference case and this variation increases with an increasing porosity among the six cases presented in the figure for all the streets the larger velocity difference compared to the reference case corresponds to cases with greater porosity i e cases c00 12 c19 00 and c19 12 the major differences are observed in the upstream street with maximum differences between 55 and 70 for cases c00 12 c19 00 and c19 12 as the variation in flow depth in the streets with respect to the reference case is limited section 3 1 the significant variation in velocity observed here is mainly due to the variation in discharge in the streets 3 3 surface velocity and recirculation flow patterns fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of the time averaged surface velocity magnitude u s along with the time averaged streamlines in all accessible areas for all cases the surface velocity magnitude ranges from 0 to 60 cms 1 0 0 1 9 ms 1 at the prototype scale the highest velocity magnitude is observed in the right street due to the high inflow discharge at the entrance of this street the velocity in the left street is three to four times lower the upstream street exhibits one or two recirculating flow areas depending on the flow case induced by the shearing with the flow in the right street and on average the flow along this street is the slowest among all the streets the downstream street is characterized by a wide range of velocity magnitude from 0 to 50 cms 1 with the highest velocities mainly located along the right wall opposite to the block under study besides the velocity magnitude within the urban block is significantly smaller than in the streets with a maximum value of 20 cms 1 0 63 ms 1 at the real world prototype scale a third of the maximum velocity on the streets within the urban block from two to five recirculating flow areas can be observed the spatial distribution and the size of the recirculating flow cells are mainly driven by the direction of the jets through the openings for instance case c00 04 shows two cells nearly symmetrical on each side of the entering jet in contrast case c06 00 with the same number of openings but aligned with the longitudinal direction shows a main recirculating flow cell and a smaller secondary one on the right side upstream these results are in agreement with those presented in several studies on shallow reservoirs e g dewals et al 2008 dufresne et al 2010 goltsman and saushin 2019 the difference in the flow pattern between c00 04 and c06 00 is partly due to the length width ratio of the reservoir which is higher for c06 00 and to the exchange flow rate magnitude three times higher for c00 04 a similar trend is observed for cases c00 12 and c19 00 with the same number of openings but along opposite axes case c00 12 exhibits two main recirculation cells one larger than the other plus three small recirculation cells driven by the jets through the right wall however c19 00 exhibits a single recirculation cell and three much smaller ones two upstream and one downstream finally case c06 04 comprises two main recirculation cells and a small one upstream while case c19 12 comprises two main recirculation cells and three small ones next to the right wall as expected the higher number of openings can increase the number of recirculation cells we can thus conclude that the flow pattern inside the urban block depends on its length width ratio length main jet direction the magnitude of the jets the number of openings porosity value and their locations porosity distribution in absence of urban block case c100 100 two recirculating flow cells of similar size are generated contrary to what is observed for the other cases within the block in this case the flow velocity in the recirculation cells does not decrease as drastically compared to the streets velocity mainly in the downstream cell amongst all cases here is where the highest average velocities are found 4 flood risk to pedestrians assuming that the surface velocity calculated with lspiv is equal to the depth averaged velocity valid assumption according to figures shown in the appendix b using the spatial distribution of local flow depth and applying the froude similarity detailed in eqs 4 and 5 2 d map of flood risk level for pedestrians was built for each flow case fig 10 this enables to assess the impact of the urban block porosity on the risk level the latter is defined by the criteria proposed in fig 2 for each flow case the flood risk ranges from low to high the highest risk being located in the right street due to the high velocity and flow depth along this street the risk level is also important in the downstream street near the right sidewall with strong flow velocities even in absence of block as it is the main path of the high speed stream as previously mentioned in contrast the level of risk inside the block is small due to the very low velocity in this open area fig 10 also shows that block porosity can enhance flood risk level at one specific location while reducing it at another for instance when comparing c00 12 with c00 00 the risk decreases in the upstream street but increases in the right street this same tendency is observed in these streets to a greater or lesser extent for the other cases except for case c19 00 where a local increase in the level of risk is predicted in the vicinity of the openings in the upstream street for the other streets only limited and local differences in the level of risk are predicted mainly in the vicinity of the openings as for instance in the downstream street of case c19 12 with a higher level of risk within the urban block the modifications of the level of risk are mainly due to changes in velocity since flow depths are almost the same throughout the area for all cases the areas of greatest risk occur near the openings along the incoming flow jets therefore the impact of porosity on the flood risk increases when porosity increases but this is spatially limited to the areas in the vicinity of the openings 5 conclusions urban flood flows were experimentally investigated on a 5 4 m long and 3 2 m wide physical model representing a rectangular urban block and four adjacent streets the focus of the study was on assessing the effects of the porosity of the urban block walls openings such as gates windows and doors on the spatial distribution of flow depth and velocity in a street network of limited spatial extent the effect of the block porosity on the flood risk to pedestrians was also estimated eight flow cases have been studied a reference case with a non porous urban block six cases varying the porosity value and the spatial distribution of the porosity along the block walls and an extreme case without block for each case the flow depth and surface velocity were measured in the streets and within the block the discharge in each street reach and the exchange discharges between block and streets were also measured block porosity was found to have a small influence on the spatial distribution of flow depths in the streets surrounding the block the average difference in flow depth compared to the reference case is approximately of 1 5 and the maximum difference of 12 when moving away from the urban block beyond the area of the block and the streets that surround it these two percentages fall to 1 and 3 respectively it should be noted that flow depth can strongly vary from either side of a block wall i e between the block and the street from 14 smaller flow depth in the street to 10 higher flow depth in the street this result questions the common practices to consider the flow level in the building equal to that in the adjacent street to estimate the potential damages of a flooding scenario the impact of the block porosity is far more significant on the local bulk velocity and discharges in the streets surrounding the block changes in flow discharge up to 70 compared with the reference case inside the block the value and distribution of the porosity have a significant influence on the flow pattern the number and size of the recirculating flow cells are mainly driven by the magnitude and locations of the exchange inflows and outflows between street and block however when moving further away from the block the influence of the porosity is limited similar to that observed for flow depths and could therefore be neglected variation in block porosity was found to modify the flood risk to pedestrians only locally near the openings both in the street and block as a result if assessing the flood risk at the scale of a building entrance one address is required it is recommended to take into account the porosity of the buildings and urban blocks when performing risk maps when assessing the risk at a more global scale present results seem to indicate a limited impact of the porosity still this result will have to be confirmed by further studies last the present experiments were performed under steady flow conditions and therefore the effect of storage by the block was not quantified however as buildings and urban blocks are porous structures the effect of their storage capacity during urban flooding could play an important role thus future experiments on the muri model will focus on the effect of a variable storage porosity of the urban block on the flood hazard under unsteady flow conditions credit authorship contribution statement miguel angel mejía morales methodology validation formal analysis investigation writing

signal was tested by performing 13 independent flow depth measurements at various locations in the streets within the block and in specific areas with significant fluctuations in flow depth such as crossroads each measurement was carried out for 400 s at a sampling rate of 50 hz for each measurement the time averaged flow depth over each partial acquisition duration was computed and compared to the time averaged flow depth over the total acquisition duration 400 s as a 1 δ d n t 1 n t i 1 n t d i 1 n t 400 i 1 n t 400 d i where d i is the instantaneous flow depth and n t is the number of samples at time t then the appropriate acquisition duration was defined as the time t for which δ d n t is lower than 0 3 mm accuracy specified by the manufacturer as shown in fig a 11 this duration was 50 s a 2 adv velocity data the time convergence of the adv velocity data was tested by measuring for 600 s at a sampling rate of 100 hz although the adv is capable of measuring the three velocity components u x u y u z we focused on the horizontal components u x u y which are used to compute the discharge in the streets and also to be compared with the velocities obtained via lspiv velocity measurements were performed at 14 locations eight in the streets and six within the block and for various cases with the porous block non porous block and no block we considered a time convergence criterion of 3 equal to the value of the standard error observed for the inlet discharge the percentage error of the time averaged velocity for each partial acquisition duration was obtained with the following expression a 2 error n t 1 n t i 1 n t u i 1 n t 600 i 1 n t 600 u i 1 n t 600 i 1 n t 600 u i 100 where u i is the instantaneous velocity in general the convergence was obtained earlier in the streets blue curves fig a 12 than within the block red curves therefore two appropriate acquisition durations were proposed 100 s for the adv measurements within the streets and 200 s within the block a 3 surface velocity using lspiv technique to evaluate the appropriate video recording duration for the lspiv technique convergence tests were established by recording at a rate of 25 frames per second the velocity field of two cases c19 12 and c100 100 with increasing durations from 10 s to 180 s and averaging in time the surface velocity over the entire area the convergence criterion was the duration where the velocity difference for each point of the velocity field with respect to the velocity of the total recording time t 180 s is equal or less than 1 cms 1 for at least 80 of the total number of points in the measuring grid the time averaged velocity difference for each point in the velocity field was computed with the following expression a 3 δ u s n t 1 n t i 1 n t u i 1 n t 180 i 1 n t 180 u i the convergence was obtained earlier within the block after 10 s as indicated on the upper graph in fig a 13 than in the streets after 60 s lower graph in fig a 13 for this reason it has been defined as the appropriate recording duration for the lspiv technique 60 s additionally figs a 14 and a 15 show the time averaged surface velocities for different recording durations for cases c19 12 and c100 100 respectively they provide a visual comparison of the velocity field over the entire domain and it is possible to observe that globally the velocity field generally does not present important changes over time appendix b comparison between adv and lspiv velocity data b 1 velocities measured within the urban block see fig b 16 b 2 velocities measured in the streets see fig b 17 appendix c impact of the extrapolation techniques on the discharge estimate in the streets the computation of discharges in the streets with the velocity area method eqs 1 and 2 requires an extrapolation of the measured velocity field at the cross sectional boundaries bed walls and free surface due to the complex flow patterns measured in the streets see fig c 18 distinct assumptions are required for this extrapolation three conditions have been proposed i the no slip boundary condition assumes that the velocity of the fluid layer in direct contact with the boundary is equal to the boundary velocity rapp 2017 in this case u 0 ii the slip boundary condition assumes a relative movement between the fluid layer and the boundary in this case it is assumed that the velocity at the boundary is equal to the nearest velocity fluid and iii the no slip slip boundary conditions assumes an average of the previous two discharges computed using these three conditions at the bed and walls and the slip boundary condition at the free surface were compared with the discharge readings given by the electromagnetic flowmeter it was found that for all of these discharges applying the average of the no slip and slip boundary conditions on the bed and walls yields the smallest error 1 5 on average appendix d additional experiments to study the impact of urban block porosity on the

4190,physical modelling of urban flooding usually considers that the flow is concentrated in the streets assuming that urban blocks and individual buildings are non porous structures this assumption is open to criticism as potential lateral flow exchanges through openings in the walls of an urban block e g gates windows and doors are likely to modify the flow pattern in the block and adjacent streets this paper reports an experimental study conducted on a 5 4 m long and 3 2 m wide physical model representing a rectangular urban block and four surrounding streets the focus of the study was on investigating the lateral flow exchange processes between the porous urban block and its adjacent streets during flooding for a variable urban block porosity eight porosity values were studied keeping the same boundary conditions a porosity equals zero i e a flow around a non porous block served as a reference flow situation for each porosity value the impact of the lateral flow exchanges on the spatial distribution of flow depth and velocity in the streets and within the block was assessed as well as the risk to pedestrians first it was found that in the streets surrounding the block flow depth and depth averaged velocity can vary by 12 and 70 respectively when modifying block porosity within the block the most impacted flow parameter is the number and size of horizontal secondary flow cells second noticeable differences in flow depth can be observed from either side of an opening between street and block third when moving away from the block flow parameters are little affected last the risk to pedestrians which is both related to local flow depth and velocity is dependent on the block porosity value keywords laboratory experiment urban flood risk wall porosity lspiv technique 1 introduction according to unisdr et al 2015 flood events increased by 39 from 2004 to 2013 with respect to the previous decade the damage to goods and people caused by these events is particularly significant in urban settlements mainly because of the high population density and the value of assets as reported by united nations et al 2019 the number of people living in urban areas worldwide is increasing and it is estimated that by 2050 it will be the case for two thirds of the world s population therefore developing methodologies to assess the urban flood hazard and the associated risk with higher precision is particularly relevant flood hazard is usually described by flow depth flood extent flow velocity flood wave propagation flood duration and the water s rising rate de moel et al 2009 among these the most common parameters are the local velocity and flow depth used for the prediction of building damage e g jakob et al 2012 lo et al 2012 maiwald and schwarz 2012 milanesi et al 2018 instability of parked and transit vehicles e g shu et al 2011 xia et al 2011 2014b teo et al 2012 kramer et al 2016 martínez gomariz et al 2017 gómez et al 2018 and people s

urban flood studies are more often conducted to quantify the spatial distribution of velocity and flow depth to establish flood hazard and risk maps e g chen et al 2019 costabile et al 2020 galuppini et al 2020 however studying flood events in an urban environment remains a challenge because it requires incorporating various topographical details in the flooding model e g buildings street furniture and vehicles sewage system subway and the latter must account for the complex interplay between flow and topographical and hydraulic singularities e g interaction with fixed and mobile obstacles streets sewer network or streets buildings flow exchanges among the tools used to study these events numerical modelling is the most widely used method especially two dimensional 2 d modelling e g mignot et al 2006 soares frazão et al 2008 el kadi abderrezzak et al 2009 guinot 2012 bazin et al 2017 since i flows within the urban area are too complex for 1 d models ii the involved horizontal geometrical length scales are often large compared to flow depths and iii studies using 3 d modelling demand a high computational cost paquier et al 2019 however the scarcity of detailed and reliable data on real world urban flood events represents a drawback to the calibration and validation of these models macchione et al 2019 in this context laboratory physical models are a convenient alternative especially useful for investigating flow patterns in complex geometries under controlled conditions finaud guyot et al 2018 they can provide reliable information and detailed observations at local scale and can also be used as a benchmark tool for the calibration of numerical models although real world urban blocks and individual buildings include openings e g doors windows gates fences and interior spaces e g gardens courtyards parking lots most experimental urban flood studies consider them as non porous structures through which the flow cannot enter e g ishigaki 2003 araud et al 2014 finaud guyot et al 2018 however to the best of the authors knowledge no study has proved that the impact of the exchanges between the street network and urban blocks on the flow characteristics is negligible and accordingly has to be discarded in general terms very few studies are dedicated to the flows entering buildings during floods except for the study of zhou et al 2016 who represented buildings as square aligned and staggered obstacles over a plain with square open windows and the study of sturm et al 2018 who represented them as real world building shapes over a floodplain with open windows and doors as the lateral flow exchanges between urban blocks and streets have been little studied we took a closer look on these physical processes based on a laboratory experiment it was conducted using a tilting physical model termed muri maquette urbaine pour l étude du risque d inondation i e urban model for the study of flood risk at the hydraulics and hydro morphology laboratory of inrae centre lyon villeurbanne france fig 1 a the focus was on the exchanges between one single porous urban block and four adjacent streets fig 1b and c the openings in the urban block walls stand for wide gates eight values of porosity were studied including a reference flow situation with a porosity equal to zero the main aim was to assess the impact of a variable block porosity on flow depths velocities and flow patterns in the streets and block and on the lateral discharges through each opening risk maps for pedestrians in the streets and block were then deduced from the flood hazard assessment section 2 outlines the experimental methodology including the description of the physical model the measurement techniques the flow cases studied and the flood risk criterion for pedestrians section 3 reports the impact of porosity on the measured flow features water depth and velocity exchange discharges horizontal secondary flow cells section 4 discusses its impact on the related flood risk to pedestrians inside the block and in the neighbouring streets the main conclusions are eventually drawn in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 experimental set up the physical model for the study of flood risk is a 5 4 m long and 3 8 m wide rectangular tilting platform which comprises three longitudinal streets and three transverse streets and represents an urban district fig 1a for this study the working zone was reduced to 5 4 m 3 2 m focusing on a single 1 56 m long and 0 96 m wide rectangular block and four surrounding streets upstream downstream right and left of equal width b 0 15 m fig 1b and c with two discharge inlets upstream end of the right and left streets and 4 discharge outlets downstream end of all streets the sidewalls of the block and streets are made of transparent plastic and the platform bed is made of grey pvc the model bed slope in the longitudinal direction aligned with the x axis s 0 x was set at 0 12 and the slope in the lateral direction aligned with the y axis s 0 y equals zero no building or furniture was placed within the block to maximize any potential flow through it the porosity of the urban block walls was varied by changing the number of openings along them with a maximum of three in each wall each opening was 6 cm wide and 8 cm high and the free surface flow always remained below the opening top the total inlet discharge q in t 6 5 ls 1 was partitioned between the inflow in the right street q in 1 4 5 ls 1 and left street q in 2 2 0 ls 1 as shown in fig 1c each inlet discharge was adjusted with an independent valve flowmeter system with a standard error of 3 of the flow rate a honeycomb plastic grid was placed at the entrance of each street to straighten out the flow at the outlet of each street the flow fell into an outlet tank the outlet discharge was then monitored using an electromagnetic flowmeter optiflux 2000 by krohne the four outlet discharges are denoted as q out 1 q out 2 q out 3 and q out 4 as depicted in fig 1c at the downstream end of each street a vertical tail weir enables flow depths in the street network to be controlled in the present study the weir heights were set to get a higher flow depth in the right street than in the left street making easier a transverse flow through the porous block the weir height w 4 cm at outlet 1 while w 3 cm at outlets 2 3 and 4 the scale ratio in the horizontal plane λ xy equals 50 and the vertical scale ratio λ z equals 10 the model then represents in the real world an urban block of 78 0 m 48 0 m and 7 5 m wide streets with 3 m wide gates and flow depths of about 0 60 m this difference in scale ratios leads to a distorted scale model with a distortion ratio λ xy λ z 5 which ensures i greater flow depths allowing greater accuracy during measurements and ii larger reynolds numbers improving the dynamic similarity with the prototype chanson 2004 2 2 measuring techniques to answer all questions raised in section 1 the measuring devices had to be set to assess i the flow depth fields in streets and within the urban block ii the discharge within each street reach iii the discharge entering or leaving the urban block through each opening and iv the velocity field over the whole measuring domain following subsections detail the corresponding measurement methods 2 2 1 flow depth the 2 d field of flow depth d was obtained using an ultrasonic distance measuring sensor us with a resolution better than 0 3 mm and reproducibility better than 0 5 mm baumer undk 20i6914 s35a the estimated flow depth uncertainty equals 0 65 mm the us is fixed on a mechanical gantry system moving along both longitudinal x axis and transverse y axis directions each measurement was taken at a sampling rate of 50 hz for 50 s time convergence tests were carried out to define the appropriate acquisition duration see appendix a 1 for more details the spatial interval between two measurements in the streets was equal to 5 0 cm and 6 5 cm in the streamwise and spanwise directions 3 measurements in the street cross section respectively and to 12 0 cm along both directions within the urban block 2 2 2 velocity the flow velocity in the water column was measured using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv with a side looking probe nortek vectrino its accuracy is 0 5 of the measured value the three instantaneous velocity components u x u y u z were measured at each point at a sampling rate of 100 hz for 100 s in the streets and 200 s within the urban block these acquisition durations were defined based on time convergence tests of the adv signal under various flow conditions as presented in appendix a 2 water was seeded with polyamide particles vestosint with an average particle diameter of 55 μm to increase the signal to noise ratio the winadv software was used to process the adv raw data including a filtering step based on the despiking technique proposed by goring and nikora 2002 the sampling standard errors for the time averaged local velocity components u x u y and u z are 0 20 cms 1 0 4 0 06 cms 1 1 5 and 0 10 cms 1 3 7 respectively in the streets these errors were estimated based on 20 times series of 100 s each at the same measuring point at three different locations and 0 13 cms 1 2 0 0 05 cms 1 23 3 and 0 04 cms 1 10 5 respectively within the urban block 20 times series of 200 s at one location the surface velocity in the streets and within the block was measured using the large scale particle image velocimetry technique lspiv in previous studies this technique proved to be reliable for a laboratory use e g muste et al 2000 kantoush et al 2011 being able to accurately measure small velocities in shallow depth flows meselhe et al 2004 and to properly distinguish large scale and small scale flow structures fujita et al 1998 wood shavings with diameters ranging from 1 to 4 mm were used as free surface tracers this light and pale material sharply contrasted with the dark grey colour of the model bed a video camera panasonic hc v770 was placed 2 8 m above the experimental set up with the optical axis perpendicular to the model bed the spatial resolution of the camera was 1920 px 1080 px with a recording rate of 25 frames per second in addition to natural light four led lamps with an adjustable light intensity were used along with light diffusion screens to light up the set up the free fudaa lspiv software co developed by edf inrae was used to process the videos and compute the time averaged surface velocities the required recording duration was 60 s see time convergence tests of the 2 d distribution of time averaged velocity in appendix a 3 for more details it should be mentioned that seeding the flow at only one location to measure surface velocities over the entire domain was found to be inappropriate in this case a large seeding generates clogging in small velocity areas and along the main streets while a limited seeding does not deliver sufficient tracers in the upstream transverse street and within the urban block the best procedure arising from preliminary tests was actually to perform various videos with different seeding locations for a given flow case a procedure only possible under steady flow conditions seeding the flow at the entrance of the right and left streets a first video recorded the tracer movements in the right left and downstream streets seeding at the entrance of the upstream street a second video recorded the tracers in this street last seeding the flow near the block openings on the street side a third video was taken to measure surface velocity within the urban block application of the lspiv technique was then performed in each of these three areas independently and the resulting surface velocities were finally plotted on the same map the agreement in velocity magnitude and velocity direction at the intersections of the three zones gave confidence in the quality of the surface velocity measurement finally to validate the surface velocity results the velocity measured by lspiv was compared to adv velocity two types of adv velocity data were considered here near surface velocities and depth averaged velocities within the block the fair agreement of the lspiv velocities with these two types of adv velocity data proves that flow is mainly two dimensional see fig b 16 in appendix b in the streets although velocity magnitude and recirculating flow areas are adequately captured by lspiv the results in some areas near the crossroads appear to be less accurate mainly due to the presence of strong flow depth variations in addition the slight decrease in velocity when approaching the walls in some areas was not observed either see fig b 17 in appendix b overall the velocities obtained with the lspiv technique in the streets are slightly lower than the near surface adv data mainly due to the clogging of the tracers a video of the tracers motion used for lspiv is available as supplementary material 2 2 3 discharge the flow velocity within the water column was measured at 9 to 10 elevations depending on flow depth and at 15 lateral positions across the wetted area in a street the discharge in a street reach was then computed by integrating the adv velocity data across the street as follows 1 q st 0 b 0 d u x d z d y for x axis oriented streets and 2 q st 0 b 0 d u y d z d x for y axis oriented streets where q st is the discharge in the street reach u x and u y are the local time averaged velocity components along the x axis and y axis respectively we should keep in mind that the inlet and outlet discharges were measured using electromagnetic flowmeters then based on the mass conservation law at each crossroad and each opening the number of cross sections over which the discharge had to be computed by eqs 1 and 2 from the adv data was set just sufficient to assess the discharge within each street reach and through each opening additional cross sectional adv measurements were performed to compute discharges with eqs 1 and 2 and verify that they were in agreement with discharges obtained using the mass conservation law while the velocity field was measured as close as possible from the bed lateral walls and free surface areas along all four boundaries of a street cross section remained blind with no available velocity measurement to estimate the discharge using eqs 1 and 2 an extrapolation of the measured velocity field was thus required with a slip boundary condition applied at the free surface and the average between slip and no slip boundary conditions applied along the bed and lateral walls for more details see appendix c finally it should be reminded that the estimate of the discharge at a given cross section in a street network remains a challenging task even though innovative techniques tend to arise finaud guyot et al 2019 preliminary tests were conducted to compare the discharge estimated by eqs 1 and 2 with the discharges measured by the electromagnetic flowmeters located upstream of the inlet tanks and downstream of the outlet tanks obtaining an average error of 1 5 therefore although the method requires assumptions to cover the blind zones near the boundaries bed walls and free surface as well as the inconvenience of using an intrusive instrument adv in a narrow cross section the results seem to be fairly reliable 2 3 flow conditions and experimental cases the experiments were conducted under steady flow conditions and subcritical regime the hydraulic boundary conditions i e inflow discharges and heights of the tail weirs were kept constant from one porosity value to another the porosity along each wall was defined as 3 ψ n l op l i i x y where ψ is the wall porosity n is the number of openings along the wall l op is the length of the opening and l i is the total length of the wall oriented in direction i the flow cases and the associated porosity values are reported in table 1 only symmetrical distributions of the wall porosity were considered the same value along the right and left streets and the same along the upstream and downstream streets the case c00 00 with a non porous block as mostly considered by previous works in the literature serves as a reference flow situation the extreme case c100 100 without urban block represents an urban configuration of a main square in between a small porosity a single opening along a wall and a large porosity three openings along a wall are both studied with six cases featuring the same porosity along face to face walls along x axis direction c00 04 and 00 12 y axis direction c06 00 and c19 00 and finally along both directions c06 04 and c19 12 2 4 risk criterion for pedestrians for each flow case the local flow depth and depth averaged velocity together hazard with the vulnerability of pedestrians to flooding enable the risk level to be assessed the vulnerability was determined based on the product number pn ud where u is the depth averaged velocity magnitude and d the flow depth over the past 50 years several studies have been conducted with real people to estimate their threshold of instability in flood flows e g foster and cox 1973 takahashi et al 1992 karvonen et al 2000 jonkman and penning rowsell 2008 russo et al 2013 martínez gomariz et al 2016 with real people and using a concrete monolith representing a real size person e g abt et al 1989 using scale models e g xia et al 2014a which is a more conservative approach that may well represent the lower limit of people s stability or by observations made during real flood events e g milanesi et al 2016 the results of each study showed a significant scatter and this was of course expected as the instability threshold can be influenced by many parameters defining human beings e g the weight height age strength skills psychological characteristics as well as the test conditions e g experimental set up protective equipment clothing of subjects and methodology e g subject standing or walking criteria for instability carried out in the various studies cox et al 2010 proposed vulnerability curves based on people instability data sets available at that time however in the last 10 years additional studies have been carried out mainly exploring conditions of instability in shallow flow with high velocities common during floods in urban areas e g russo et al 2013 xia et al 2014a martínez gomariz et al 2016 these studies as well as experiences acquired and observations made by chanson et al 2014 suggest that the people s instability in urban areas during floods begins at lower flow depths and velocities than those reported in previous studies therefore following a procedure similar to that performed by cox et al 2010 a new criterion of risk to pedestrian during flooding in urban areas is proposed based on the available experimental data and field observations on people s instability and on various guidelines for the safety of people during flooding three product number thresholds are proposed first pn 0 3 m2 s 1 defines the lower limit of people s stability according to xia et al 2014a and abt et al 1989 results obtained using the concrete monolith up to d 0 7 m based on the curve for critical self evacuation proposed by ishigaki et al 2009 and up to u 2 0 ms 1 based on the limit of people s stability at small flow depths found by russo et al 2013 and martínez gomariz et al 2016 second pn 0 7 m2 s 1 is the upper limit of xia et al 2014a results and where the first signs of people s instability begin for studies conducted by abt et al 1989 takahashi et al 1992 and karvonen et al 2000 up to d 0 95 m and up to u 2 7 ms 1 which represents approximately the mid point in the range of velocities found for people instability at small flow depths found by russo et al 2013 and martínez gomariz et al 2016 and third pn 1 0 m2 s 1 corresponds to approximately the 50 limit of instability cases of the total data set up to d 1 2 m proposed by cox et al 2010 being the largest flow depth tested in the available data series and up to u 3 5 ms 1 which is approximately the upper limit of people s stability at shallow flow according to russo et al 2013 and martínez gomariz et al 2016 i e above this limit almost all pedestrians exhibit instability all these vulnerability curves are shown in the flood risk diagram for pedestrians in fig 2 and they define four flood risk levels which are as follows low very few pedestrians exhibit instability up to 2 of the total data set moderate some pedestrians exhibit instability up to 20 of the total data set significant many pedestrians exhibit instability up to 50 of the total data set high most pedestrians exhibit instability above 50 of total data set the estimate of the local level of risk for pedestrians requires to firstly pass the results from the physical model scale to the real world prototype scale using froude similarity fr m fr p chanson 2004 heller 2011 the following ratios are obtained 4 u p u m λ z 1 2 for velocity 5 d p d m λ z for flow depth where subscripts m and p refer to the model and the prototype respectively 3 measured flow features 3 1 flow depth fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of flow depth d in the streets and urban block for all cases putting aside the case without block c100 100 the flow depth ranges from 5 cm to 7 5 cm 0 50 m 0 75 m in the prototype for all flow cases the largest flow depths are observed in the right street due to both the high inflow discharge in this street and the backwater effect due to the 4 cm high tail weir located at the outlet of this street fig 1c inside the urban block as the free surface is almost horizontal the flow depth slightly increases along the x axis due to the longitudinal bed slope of the model interestingly the flow depth within the urban block can differ from the flow depth in the adjacent streets in the right street the flow depth is higher than in the block up to 10 at x 3 25 m for cases with a porosity along the upstream and downstream block walls only i e cases c06 00 and c19 00 in contrast the flow depth can be smaller in the downstream street than in the block e g by 14 at y 0 30 m for cases with a porosity along the right and left block walls only c00 04 and c00 12 fig 4 shows the relative difference in flow depth δ d for each case with respect to the reference case c00 00 defined as 6 δ d d d ref d ref 100 where d ref refers to the flow depth of the reference case c00 00 in the streets surrounding the urban block the relative difference in flow depth δ d can reach up to 7 in the right street and 12 5 in the downstream street case c19 12 in contrast when moving away from the block flow depths in the street reaches located upstream and downstream of the block for x 2 94 m x 4 80 m and y 1 26 m do not show significant variations with respect to the reference case with a maximum of 3 5 case c19 00 3 2

flowmeters are indicated by shaded boxes the discharges computed using eqs 1 and 2 are highlighted in purple and the discharges computed from the mass conservation equation are highlighted in orange colour in the middle of the block the intrusion discharge is highlighted in pink obtained as the average between the sum of discharges entering green arrows and leaving red arrows the block along with the corresponding uncertainty this uncertainty includes the errors coming from the measuring instruments electromagnetic flowmeter and adv and from the discharge computation method due to additional adv measurements several error values can be obtained in all cases the maximum value obtained is about 1 of the total inlet discharge and this is the one shown in all the cases in fig 5 all the discharge values are shown as a percentage of the total inlet discharge q in t 6 5 ls 1 in the streets the direction of the flow is the same for all cases i e from upstream to downstream in the two longitudinal streets and from right to left in the two transverse streets in contrast the direction of the exchange flow through the openings may vary from one case to another regarding the discharge magnitude when using case c00 00 as a reference flow situation fig 5 shows that the change in porosity i significantly affects the discharges in the streets surrounding the urban block ii significantly affects the discharge entering the block which logically increases with an increasing porosity and iii hardly alters the outlet discharges putting aside the extreme case without block c100 100 the relative differences in discharge in the streets with respect to the reference flow case δ q st are shown in fig 6 they are computed at the upstream end of the four surrounding streets the relative difference δ q st increases with block porosity for instance for cases c00 04 and c00 12 δ q st 40 and 70 in the upstream street δ q st 21 and 36 in the left street and δ q st 6 to 10 in the right street respectively the same tendency is observed when comparing cases c06 00 and c19 00 or cases c06 04 and c19 12 the exchange discharges through the block openings also increase with the porosity see fig 7 however no tendency arises for the intrusion discharge as a function of the porosity for instance if we compare three pairs of cases where the porosity is increased by 200 the increase in discharge is 78 from c00 04 to c00 12 240 from c06 00 to c19 00 and 70 from c06 04 to c19 12 it is also interesting to investigate the influence of the porosity distribution for a fixed total number of openings along the block walls for two openings cases c00 04 and c06 00 fig 7 indicates that the discharge through the urban block is greater by approximately 90 with openings in the right and left walls than with openings in the upstream and downstream walls however for six openings when comparing cases c00 12 and c19 00 the discharge through the urban block is practically the same hence the exchange discharge between streets and block does not depend only on the porosity value this is a more complex process depending on the location of the openings the flow orientation through these openings the flow circulation within the block and flow depths and discharges in the surrounding streets finally when moving away from the block the outlet discharges are hardly affected by a change in porosity the flow distribution among the four outlets is rather constant from one case to another when putting aside the extreme case without block c100 100 as shown at the top right of fig 5 the maximum variation with respect to the reference case remains limited to around 2 to verify whether this was due to the imposed weir heights additional experiments were conducted for detailed information see appendix d by changing the hydraulic boundary conditions inflow discharge distribution between left and right streets and the height of the weirs and the longitudinal and transverse slopes the results obtained are similar as in the main experiment the urban block porosity does not significantly change the discharge distribution among the four outlets the latter is mainly driven by the presence of the urban block irrespective of the porosity value of its walls the bulk velocities in the streets for the six cases with a porous block are now compared with those of the reference case fig 8 shows the relative difference in bulk velocity δ u x b and δ u y b as appropriate for all the streets in the streets surrounding the block the bulk velocities considerably vary with respect to the reference case and this variation increases with an increasing porosity among the six cases presented in the figure for all the streets the larger velocity difference compared to the reference case corresponds to cases with greater porosity i e cases c00 12 c19 00 and c19 12 the major differences are observed in the upstream street with maximum differences between 55 and 70 for cases c00 12 c19 00 and c19 12 as the variation in flow depth in the streets with respect to the reference case is limited section 3 1 the significant variation in velocity observed here is mainly due to the variation in discharge in the streets 3 3 surface velocity and recirculation flow patterns fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of the time averaged surface velocity magnitude u s along with the time averaged streamlines in all accessible areas for all cases the surface velocity magnitude ranges from 0 to 60 cms 1 0 0 1 9 ms 1 at the prototype scale the highest velocity magnitude is observed in the right street due to the high inflow discharge at the entrance of this street the velocity in the left street is three to four times lower the upstream street exhibits one or two recirculating flow areas depending on the flow case induced by the shearing with the flow in the right street and on average the flow along this street is the slowest among all the streets the downstream street is characterized by a wide range of velocity magnitude from 0 to 50 cms 1 with the highest velocities mainly located along the right wall opposite to the block under study besides the velocity magnitude within the urban block is significantly smaller than in the streets with a maximum value of 20 cms 1 0 63 ms 1 at the real world prototype scale a third of the maximum velocity on the streets within the urban block from two to five recirculating flow areas can be observed the spatial distribution and the size of the recirculating flow cells are mainly driven by the direction of the jets through the openings for instance case c00 04 shows two cells nearly symmetrical on each side of the entering jet in contrast case c06 00 with the same number of openings but aligned with the longitudinal direction shows a main recirculating flow cell and a smaller secondary one on the right side upstream these results are in agreement with those presented in several studies on shallow reservoirs e g dewals et al 2008 dufresne et al 2010 goltsman and saushin 2019 the difference in the flow pattern between c00 04 and c06 00 is partly due to the length width ratio of the reservoir which is higher for c06 00 and to the exchange flow rate magnitude three times higher for c00 04 a similar trend is observed for cases c00 12 and c19 00 with the same number of openings but along opposite axes case c00 12 exhibits two main recirculation cells one larger than the other plus three small recirculation cells driven by the jets through the right wall however c19 00 exhibits a single recirculation cell and three much smaller ones two upstream and one downstream finally case c06 04 comprises two main recirculation cells and a small one upstream while case c19 12 comprises two main recirculation cells and three small ones next to the right wall as expected the higher number of openings can increase the number of recirculation cells we can thus conclude that the flow pattern inside the urban block depends on its length width ratio length main jet direction the magnitude of the jets the number of openings porosity value and their locations porosity distribution in absence of urban block case c100 100 two recirculating flow cells of similar size are generated contrary to what is observed for the other cases within the block in this case the flow velocity in the recirculation cells does not decrease as drastically compared to the streets velocity mainly in the downstream cell amongst all cases here is where the highest average velocities are found 4 flood risk to pedestrians assuming that the surface velocity calculated with lspiv is equal to the depth averaged velocity valid assumption according to figures shown in the appendix b using the spatial distribution of local flow depth and applying the froude similarity detailed in eqs 4 and 5 2 d map of flood risk level for pedestrians was built for each flow case fig 10 this enables to assess the impact of the urban block porosity on the risk level the latter is defined by the criteria proposed in fig 2 for each flow case the flood risk ranges from low to high the highest risk being located in the right street due to the high velocity and flow depth along this street the risk level is also important in the downstream street near the right sidewall with strong flow velocities even in absence of block as it is the main path of the high speed stream as previously mentioned in contrast the level of risk inside the block is small due to the very low velocity in this open area fig 10 also shows that block porosity can enhance flood risk level at one specific location while reducing it at another for instance when comparing c00 12 with c00 00 the risk decreases in the upstream street but increases in the right street this same tendency is observed in these streets to a greater or lesser extent for the other cases except for case c19 00 where a local increase in the level of risk is predicted in the vicinity of the openings in the upstream street for the other streets only limited and local differences in the level of risk are predicted mainly in the vicinity of the openings as for instance in the downstream street of case c19 12 with a higher level of risk within the urban block the modifications of the level of risk are mainly due to changes in velocity since flow depths are almost the same throughout the area for all cases the areas of greatest risk occur near the openings along the incoming flow jets therefore the impact of porosity on the flood risk increases when porosity increases but this is spatially limited to the areas in the vicinity of the openings 5 conclusions urban flood flows were experimentally investigated on a 5 4 m long and 3 2 m wide physical model representing a rectangular urban block and four adjacent streets the focus of the study was on assessing the effects of the porosity of the urban block walls openings such as gates windows and doors on the spatial distribution of flow depth and velocity in a street network of limited spatial extent the effect of the block porosity on the flood risk to pedestrians was also estimated eight flow cases have been studied a reference case with a non porous urban block six cases varying the porosity value and the spatial distribution of the porosity along the block walls and an extreme case without block for each case the flow depth and surface velocity were measured in the streets and within the block the discharge in each street reach and the exchange discharges between block and streets were also measured block porosity was found to have a small influence on the spatial distribution of flow depths in the streets surrounding the block the average difference in flow depth compared to the reference case is approximately of 1 5 and the maximum difference of 12 when moving away from the urban block beyond the area of the block and the streets that surround it these two percentages fall to 1 and 3 respectively it should be noted that flow depth can strongly vary from either side of a block wall i e between the block and the street from 14 smaller flow depth in the street to 10 higher flow depth in the street this result questions the common practices to consider the flow level in the building equal to that in the adjacent street to estimate the potential damages of a flooding scenario the impact of the block porosity is far more significant on the local bulk velocity and discharges in the streets surrounding the block changes in flow discharge up to 70 compared with the reference case inside the block the value and distribution of the porosity have a significant influence on the flow pattern the number and size of the recirculating flow cells are mainly driven by the magnitude and locations of the exchange inflows and outflows between street and block however when moving further away from the block the influence of the porosity is limited similar to that observed for flow depths and could therefore be neglected variation in block porosity was found to modify the flood risk to pedestrians only locally near the openings both in the street and block as a result if assessing the flood risk at the scale of a building entrance one address is required it is recommended to take into account the porosity of the buildings and urban blocks when performing risk maps when assessing the risk at a more global scale present results seem to indicate a limited impact of the porosity still this result will have to be confirmed by further studies last the present experiments were performed under steady flow conditions and therefore the effect of storage by the block was not quantified however as buildings and urban blocks are porous structures the effect of their storage capacity during urban flooding could play an important role thus future experiments on the muri model will focus on the effect of a variable storage porosity of the urban block on the flood hazard under unsteady flow conditions credit authorship contribution statement miguel angel mejía morales methodology validation formal analysis investigation writing

signal was tested by performing 13 independent flow depth measurements at various locations in the streets within the block and in specific areas with significant fluctuations in flow depth such as crossroads each measurement was carried out for 400 s at a sampling rate of 50 hz for each measurement the time averaged flow depth over each partial acquisition duration was computed and compared to the time averaged flow depth over the total acquisition duration 400 s as a 1 δ d n t 1 n t i 1 n t d i 1 n t 400 i 1 n t 400 d i where d i is the instantaneous flow depth and n t is the number of samples at time t then the appropriate acquisition duration was defined as the time t for which δ d n t is lower than 0 3 mm accuracy specified by the manufacturer as shown in fig a 11 this duration was 50 s a 2 adv velocity data the time convergence of the adv velocity data was tested by measuring for 600 s at a sampling rate of 100 hz although the adv is capable of measuring the three velocity components u x u y u z we focused on the horizontal components u x u y which are used to compute the discharge in the streets and also to be compared with the velocities obtained via lspiv velocity measurements were performed at 14 locations eight in the streets and six within the block and for various cases with the porous block non porous block and no block we considered a time convergence criterion of 3 equal to the value of the standard error observed for the inlet discharge the percentage error of the time averaged velocity for each partial acquisition duration was obtained with the following expression a 2 error n t 1 n t i 1 n t u i 1 n t 600 i 1 n t 600 u i 1 n t 600 i 1 n t 600 u i 100 where u i is the instantaneous velocity in general the convergence was obtained earlier in the streets blue curves fig a 12 than within the block red curves therefore two appropriate acquisition durations were proposed 100 s for the adv measurements within the streets and 200 s within the block a 3 surface velocity using lspiv technique to evaluate the appropriate video recording duration for the lspiv technique convergence tests were established by recording at a rate of 25 frames per second the velocity field of two cases c19 12 and c100 100 with increasing durations from 10 s to 180 s and averaging in time the surface velocity over the entire area the convergence criterion was the duration where the velocity difference for each point of the velocity field with respect to the velocity of the total recording time t 180 s is equal or less than 1 cms 1 for at least 80 of the total number of points in the measuring grid the time averaged velocity difference for each point in the velocity field was computed with the following expression a 3 δ u s n t 1 n t i 1 n t u i 1 n t 180 i 1 n t 180 u i the convergence was obtained earlier within the block after 10 s as indicated on the upper graph in fig a 13 than in the streets after 60 s lower graph in fig a 13 for this reason it has been defined as the appropriate recording duration for the lspiv technique 60 s additionally figs a 14 and a 15 show the time averaged surface velocities for different recording durations for cases c19 12 and c100 100 respectively they provide a visual comparison of the velocity field over the entire domain and it is possible to observe that globally the velocity field generally does not present important changes over time appendix b comparison between adv and lspiv velocity data b 1 velocities measured within the urban block see fig b 16 b 2 velocities measured in the streets see fig b 17 appendix c impact of the extrapolation techniques on the discharge estimate in the streets the computation of discharges in the streets with the velocity area method eqs 1 and 2 requires an extrapolation of the measured velocity field at the cross sectional boundaries bed walls and free surface due to the complex flow patterns measured in the streets see fig c 18 distinct assumptions are required for this extrapolation three conditions have been proposed i the no slip boundary condition assumes that the velocity of the fluid layer in direct contact with the boundary is equal to the boundary velocity rapp 2017 in this case u 0 ii the slip boundary condition assumes a relative movement between the fluid layer and the boundary in this case it is assumed that the velocity at the boundary is equal to the nearest velocity fluid and iii the no slip slip boundary conditions assumes an average of the previous two discharges computed using these three conditions at the bed and walls and the slip boundary condition at the free surface were compared with the discharge readings given by the electromagnetic flowmeter it was found that for all of these discharges applying the average of the no slip and slip boundary conditions on the bed and walls yields the smallest error 1 5 on average appendix d additional experiments to study the impact of urban block porosity on the

4191,sediment transfer in mountain streams occurs via processes classified as debris flows hyperconcentrated flows debris floods and water flows under the control of the water energy and the amount of involved sediment despite the extensive documentation of the channel changes caused by high magnitude hydrological events the analysis of the sediment water flows occurring during such floods is currently a minimally explored issue this study investigated how the transport mechanisms activated in a mountain stream during a high magnitude flood differ from those triggered during ordinary floods it also evaluated the effectiveness of three morphometric approaches in predicting high magnitude flows expectable in a channel sub reach the study area is the tegnas catchment dolomites italy a mountain basin affected in 2018 by a severe hydrological event vaia storm whose recurrence interval is approximately 200 years we determined the transport processes typifying the stream network in the catchment during ordinary floods through field surveys and direct monitoring and compared these flows with the high magnitude flow types that occurred during the vaia storm additionally we examined the flows predicted using the morphometric approaches for high magnitude events we observed water flow as a response to ordinary events occurring along the entire tegnas main stem whereas debris flow ordinarily determines sediment transfer at steep tributaries during the vaia storm water flow still dominated along the tegnas torrent although debris flows and debris floods were also documented at several sub reaches of the main stem the morphometric approaches satisfactorily predicted debris flows but often failed to recognize the debris floods occurred during the high magnitude 2018 flooding the analysis of different flow types enabled us to infer relationships among transport mechanisms hydraulic forcing and channel dynamics and to gain new insights on the poorly explored debris flood processes water flows transitioned into debris floods under unit stream powers exceeding the threshold of 5000 to 5500 w m 2 or downstream of sediment injection points the occurrence of debris floods which caused higher channel widening than that induced by water flows appeared to be facilitated by the presence of tributaries prone to debris flow occurrence connected to a receiving stream the injection of fine material into the flows and channels characterized by high slope and narrow section the morphometric approaches enabled adequate first order discrimination of expectable high magnitude flows but a more detailed characterization that includes field observations is necessary to understand the transport mechanisms that can affect a specific channel site during high

water flows or high magnitude flows in this study can significantly differ from those occurring in response to ordinary floods flooding with recurrence intervals of up to a number of years i e ordinary sediment water flows or ordinary flows in this study the validation of this hypothesis would represent a step toward understanding how the geomorphic work performed by high magnitude flows fits within the long term evolution of the mountain stream channels the term high magnitude flow is used in this work to define the most intense transport phenomenon occurring at a stream location during a high magnitude flood regarded as the process that involves the highest sediment concentration in sediment water flow the case study selected to validate the research hypothesis is the tegnas catchment dolomites italy which was affected in october 2018 by a severe rainstorm i e the so called vaia storm that caused considerable flooding in the mountain streams of northeastern italy pellegrini et al 2021 highlighted the occurrence of windthrows landslides and debris flows affecting the tegnas catchment slopes and the remarkable morphological changes that occurred along the entire channel network of the catchment brenna et al 2020 focused on transport processes and identified through the survey of flood deposits the high magnitude sediment water flows triggered by the vaia storm along the tegnas torrent and its tributaries in the current study the flows induced by the vaia storm were compared with 1 the flows normally active along the channel network during ordinary floods 2 the flows predicted using three morphometric approaches developed to determine high magnitude flow types moreover the transport processes induced by the vaia storm were analyzed through an integrated approach in which consideration was directed toward geomorphological dynamics and the hydraulic constraints that occurred during the event we paid specific attention to the investigation of debris floods that have been rarely explored in the literature church and jakob 2020 the research questions addressed are as follows 1 to what extent do sediment water flows that are activated during

high magnitude events 3 are morphometric approaches reliable tools for locally i e at the sub reach spatial scale predicting flows that occur in response to high magnitude floods in mountain streams 2 general setting 2 1 study area the tegnas catchment extends over the dolomites eastern italian alps and covers an area of 51 km2 with a maximum elevation of 2872 m a s l and a minimum elevation of 620 m a s l fig 1 the tegnas torrent is a right tributary of the cordevole river piave river catchment its major tributary is the bordina torrent but several streams flow into the tegnas from the slopes of the mountains that border the catchment the main characteristics of the investigated channel network are summarized in table 1 the valley floor extends in width up to 490 m and is underlain by alluvial glacial and slope deposits testa et al 2013 the tegnas basin is characterized by an alpine climate with cold winters and temperate summers during winter precipitation occurs as snow but most annual precipitation occurs during spring and late autumn a 30 year mean annual precipitation of 1620 mm is reported for the col di prà monitoring station fig 1 testa and aldighieri 2011 estimated a formative discharge of about 15 m3 s 1 recurrence interval of 1 5 years for the main stem of the tegnas torrent the lithology of the catchment consists mostly of dolostone and limestone associated with siliciclastic clay rich rocks and volcanic rocks limited to the bordina sub catchment giordano 2011 testa et al 2013 lucianetti et al 2016 land cover is mainly broadleaf and coniferous forest in the lower part of the catchment and carbonate outcrops occur at an elevation higher than about 1500 m a s l anthropic structures i e roads houses are present only along the valley floor in the village of taibon agordino near the confluence with the cordevole river the tegnas torrent is channelized by artificial levees other artificial structures are levees located along some reaches of the tegnas main stem a sediment retention check dam located along the tegnas immediately upstream of the confluence of the bordina torrent built with a narrow opening and already filled with sediment before the vaia storm marchi et al 2019 and a few small check dams on the tributaries we analyzed the transport processes taking place along the main stem of the tegnas torrent and the downstream reaches i e near the confluence with the tegnas of its nine tributaries fig 1 brenna et al 2020 divided the stream network into reaches brierley and fryirs 2005 rinaldi et al 2013 and sub reaches that are 200 to 500 m long and feature homogeneous channel slopes ferencevic and ashmore 2012 data collection and analysis were conducted at the sub reach scale seven homogeneous reaches named t1 to t7 were defined along the tegnas main stem fig 1 reach t1 characterized by a high slope s 8 7 21 3 and strong lateral confinement flows along the angheraz valley whereas reaches t2 to t7 flow within the san lucano valley downstream reaches have lower slopes s 0 3 6 1 and confinement classes defined by brenna et al 2020 considering the confinement index rinaldi et al 2013 rinaldi et al 2014 that vary from partially confined i e reaches t3 t5 t6 and t7 to unconfined i e reaches t2 and t4 classes all the terminal portions of the tributaries are characterized by steep s 13 0 39 1 and confined channels except for the bordina torrent which formed a large fan with a slope of 6 3 2 2 the vaia storm between 27 and 30 october 2018 the vaia storm characterized by a combination of extreme wind and precipitation affected most of italy and intensified over the mountain areas of the eastern italian alps the storm developed as an explosive cyclogenesis following the input of a cold air mass into the western mediterranean cavaleri et al 2019 giovannini et al 2021 the precipitation over the tegnas catchment lasted 67 h starting on october 27 at 6 20 cet and ending on october 29 at 21 40 cet with two intense phases of precipitation separated by a precipitation hiatus the first rainfall phase peaked on the evening of 28 october and was characterized by the largest accumulation while the second phase peaked on the evening of 29 october and was typified by the highest rainfall intensity precipitation accumulation in the study area exceeded 600 mm and was among the highest recorded for the storm event in northeastern italy fig 2 reports the cumulated precipitation over the entire event 27 30 october for the cordevole catchment closed at ponte mas with a drainage area of 704 km2 out

brenna et al 2020 developed a post event survey protocol to collect field evidence aimed at classifying flood deposits in mountain streams on the basis of the type of flow i e debris flow hyperconcentrated flow debris flood and water flow that deposits sediment the authors identified diagnostic criteria for detecting different sediment water flows on the basis of the morphological and sedimentological features of related deposits brenna et al 2020 applied the criteria summarized in table s1 to identify the high magnitude sediment water flows triggered by the vaia storm along the main stem of the tegnas torrent and its tributaries the same channels were also considered in this work because of the severity of the vaia induced flood at the tegnas catchment the flows triggered by this storm were considered representative of the most intense water sediment transport processes that can occur in the studied channels the survey and interpretation protocol defined by brenna et al 2020 was employed during additional surveys conducted in the current work to address the classification of other deposits i e excluding the vaia deposits along the tegnas stream network two types of deposits were considered and interpreted 1 older sediments deposited before the vaia storm pre vaia deposits hereafter and 2 recent sediments deposited after the vaia storm post vaia deposits hereafter for each sub reach we aimed at identifying one or more representative survey sites where the pre and or post vaia deposits were recognizable and their features could be characterized fig s1 we considered sites with exposed sections of about 2 10 m2 a worksheet for the field survey of the deposits brenna et al 2020 was compiled for each survey site collecting morphological and sedimentological characteristics the flow type responsible for the sedimentation of the deposits was identified as the flow type with the highest volume of recognized characteristics calculated as the percentage of evidence detected during the survey with respect to the number of evidence considered in the worksheet for each flow type the local stratigraphic record at a site of an alluvial channel can consist of interspersed deposits ascribable to different flow types e g blair 1999 it is reasonable to assume that the process building up the majority of sediment accumulation is not related to high magnitude hydrological events which can mobilize high volumes of material but at low frequencies but to flow types that ordinarily determine sediment dynamics and consequently the morphological setting of an alluvial reach church 2006 analogous to the concept of effective water discharge wolman and miller 1960 biedenharn et al 2001 the process that builds up most of the local stratigraphic record can be related to ordinary hydrological events with recurrence intervals ranging from 1 5 to 10 years in a mountain stream andrews 1980 lenzi et al 2006a surian et al 2009 rinaldi et al 2014 such assumptions are valid for alluvial stream networks in which multiple flow types can occur in light of these considerations the classification of deposits that form most local stratigraphic accumulations based on deposit thickness considering 1 2 m stretches of exposed sections at the survey sites as products of debris flow hyperconcentrated flow debris flood and water flow allowed us to determine the flow type that ordinarily affects a site of the stream network the survey of pre vaia deposits distinguished from vaia deposits using evidence such as stratigraphic position the presence of immobilized root systems and the presence of soils at the top of these deposits was conducted in july august 2019 mainly with an examination of sedimentological indicators because the original morphologies of these deposits were typically unpreserved e g reworked by later flows or unobservable fig s1a the transport processes occurring during the vaia storm eroded mobilized and deposited large volumes of sediment brenna et al 2020 pellegrini et al 2021 thereby causing the analysis of older deposits challenging and possible only at some sub reaches some low magnitude floods occurred after the vaia storm at the tegnas catchment we considered the sediments deposited by two ordinary hydrological events that occurred in august and october 2020 with maximum water discharges of about 8 to 10 m3 s 1 which were measured along the tegnas torrent at taibon agordino these values are slightly lower than the formative discharge of 15 m3 s 1 estimated by testa and aldighieri 2011 for the tegnas torrent analysis and interpretations of post vaia deposits were focused on the tegnas main stem and carried out immediately after event occurrence i e september and november 2020 moreover the transport phenomena were directly observed during the 30 august 2020 event at some key points of the stream network the flow types recognized from such surveys were regarded similar to the processes inferred from the stratigraphic record as representative of the ordinary flows characterizing each sub reach of the stream 3 2 catchment morphometrics for determining flow types as responses to high magnitude events morphometric parameters are powerful indicators for predicting the sediment water flows occurring in response to high magnitude events in mountain catchments kostaschuk et al 1986 jackson et al 1987 marchi et al 1993 calvache et al 1997 sorriso valvo et al 1998 marchi and brochot 2000 de scally and owens 2004 wilford et al 2004 santangelo et al 2012 bertrand et al 2013 high magnitude flow types are related to morphometric indexes such as the channel slope watershed length and melton s number i e the ratio of catchment relief to the square root of a catchment area melton 1965 the methods cited in this paragraph were originally intended to be applied at the catchment scale that is to detect expected flow types at the outlet of a catchment e g at a fan apex in the present study we explored the effectiveness of morphometric indices in detecting flow types that occur in response to a high magnitude event not only at the catchment outlet as originally intended but also at different channel locations of a mountain stream through an original semi distributed application of such methods to determine the expected high magnitude flow type at the 35 sub reaches analyzed in this work table 1 we employed three morphometric approaches which were proposed by marchi et al 1993 wilford et al 2004 and bertrand et al 2013 marchi et al 1993 analyzed 58 channels of the eastern italian alps classifying flow processes into debris flows mixed flows and fluvial flows synonymous to water flows in channels classified as mixed flows both debris and water flows occur during high magnitude events but debris floods are often the dominant process bertrand et al 2013 adopted a similar approach but used a larger world dataset and performed a simple binary classification that distinguishes channels where debris including mixed flow cases and fluvial flows occur in response to high magnitude events the approaches of marchi et al 1993 and bertrand et al 2013 uncovered significant relationships among high magnitude flow types fan or channel slope and the melton s number fig 3 a and b differently from marchi et al 1993 who proposed empirical thresholds of fan slope and melton s number bertrand et al 2013 based the discrimination between the flow types on a rigorous statistical analysis wilford et al 2004 proposed a different method on the grounds of the results obtained for 65 canadian streams they considered three flow types i e debris flows water flows and debris floods and concluded that the melton s number and watershed length i e the distance from the fan apex to the most distant point on a watershed boundary are the most appropriate morphometric attributes for differentiation between channels affected by different high magnitude processes fig 3c the morphometric parameters required to apply the three morphometric approaches i e drainage area maximum and minimum elevations of a drainage area local channel slope and watershed length were determined for each sub reach of the stream network using a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 5 m and a vertical error of approximately 0 5 m https idt2 regione veneto it 3 3 hydrological analysis radar rainfall observations from the c band monte grande antenna located at a distance of 60 km from the basin of interest combined with data from 54 rain gauges provided high temporal 20 min and spatial 1 km2 representations of rainfall from the vaia storm over the cordevole catchment closed at ponte mas 704 km2 which encompasses the tegnas catchment a number of procedures were applied to the reflectivity data to correct the following error sources ground clutter partial beam occlusion path attenuation and wind drift the dynamic bias correction method cole and moore 2008 was used to combine radar based rainfall estimates and rain gauge measurements the assessment of flood response in ungauged catchments such as the tegnas which cannot be based on stream gauge data can be performed through flood forensic analyses borga et al 2019 these analyses involve 1 surveying post flood river reach topography and high water marks 2 applying one or two dimensional hydraulic models and 3 comparing results with outcomes from radar based hydrological models of flood response gaume and borga 2008 the sequence of two rainfall events which occurred on 27 28 and 29 october after a prolonged dry and warm period brought forth two distinct discharge peaks the first peak was relatively moderate as it was controlled by the very low initial soil moisture conditions whereas the second phase was characterized by extreme rain rates falling over wet soils which generated extreme peak discharges hydrologic response to the vaia storm was examined using a grid based spatially distributed hydrologic model termed the gris grid based runoff simulation model the distributed model requires raster information on landscape topography as well as soil geology and vegetation properties the model was run in conjunction with the probability distributed model pdm moore 2007 which was applied in a grid by grid manner to derive a spatially distributed representation of runoff generating processes and a simple description of drainage system response da ros and borga 1997 was used to represent runoff propagation using a kinematic model the pdm requires the specification of a number of parameters and chiefly the estimation of the maximum storage capacity that yields the spatially distributed soil water storage capacity the procedure for determining distributed runoff propagation is based on the identification of drainage paths and requires the characterization of hillslope paths and channeled paths as well as the specification of two invariant hillslope and channel velocities hillslope and channeled flow paths are determined using the drainage threshold area parameter the maximum storage capacity was estimated on the basis of available information concerning the different geological formations of the catchment information that was retrieved from official geo lithological maps different lithological types were grouped into five classes ranging from low to high permeability following norbiato et al 2009 the gris model parameters were calibrated simultaneously over multiple catchments on the grounds of available hydrological data on the vaia flooding over the cordevole basin a combination of manual and automatic calibration was conducted to minimize integrated normalized flood peak errors the geological information encompassed data on two catchments equipped with stream gauge sections and seven catchments where flood peaks were indirectly estimated via a post flood survey the gris model was implemented calibrated and validated over the upper cordevole basin by using data from multiple post event surveys and two stream gauge stations which recorded the flood hydrographs for two headwater basins this allowed a robust identification of the model parameters the application of the model to the tegnas catchment provided a simulated peak discharge of 167 m3 s 1 which corresponds to the upper limit of the uncertainty bound 3 4 calculation of stream power the unit stream power bagnold 1977 bagnold 1980 induced by water flow on a streambed can advance the analysis of coarse sediment dynamics and geomorphological processes in channels where fluid gravity flows occur e g magilligan 1992 costa and o connor 1995 ferguson 2005 comiti and mao 2012 magilligan et al 2015 surian et al 2016 the unit stream power is defined as follows 1 ω ρ g q s w where ρ denotes the water density 1000 kg m 3 g represents the gravity acceleration 9 81 m s 2 q is the water discharge m3 s 1 s is the local channel slope m m and w is the channel width m we used eq 1 to calculate the unit stream power during the peak of the vaia flooding ωpk on the tegnas main stem and the bordina torrent at sub reaches dominated by water flows and debris floods where the flows were newtonian and the sediment mobilization was mainly water driven sub reaches affected by debris flows or hyperconcentrated flows were excluded from ωpk calculation since the unit stream power is not an appropriate metrics for describing sediment gravity and plastic flows maximum water discharge qmax was computed by applying the calibrated rainfall runoff model to the examination at the sub reach scale the slope of the channel sub reach s was derived from the dem we employed two aerial orthophotographs with a resolution of 0 2 m acquired in 2015 and 2019 by the veneto region to determine the mean channel width of each sub reach before wpre and after wpost the vaia storm the 2015 and 2019 channels were digitized in arcgis 10 5 and the average channel widths were calculated as the ratio between the area spanning the channel sub reach and its length given that the channel width at the flood peak is unknown as with other works e g surian et al 2016 righini et al 2017 the unit stream power for the vaia flooding was calculated using eq 1 with both wpre pre flood unit stream power ωpk pre and wpost post flood unit stream power ωpk post as channel width w the unit stream power at the flood peak ωpk had a value falling between ωpk pre and ωpk post 4 results 4 1 rainfall and peak discharge in the tegnas catchment the precipitation estimation yielded areal cumulative rainfall over the tegnas amounting to 563 mm with 1 km2 maxima of 73 2 166 7 and 679 3 mm over one hour over three consecutive hours and the entire event respectively these max rainfall values were characterized by very high return periods all exceeding 200 years as determined using generalized extreme value gev distribution jenkinson 1955 implemented using l moments following norbiato et al 2007 the indirect peak discharge of the vaia storm estimated under the assumption of critical flow at a water diversion weir in the downstream part of the tegnas torrent sub reach t6 3 with a drainage area of 49 km2 fig 1 amounted to 154 m3 s 1 the upper and lower error bounds of 167 and 134 m3 s 1 respectively were identified to take into account uncertainties in the recognition of high water marks which were also influenced by intense sediment transport the application of the gris model in a multi catchment manner uncovered at the same outlet a simulated peak discharge of 167 m3 s 1 which corresponds to the upper limit of the uncertainty bound and testifies to the consistency of the post event discharge reconstruction with modeling a severity assessment was carried out for this peak flow using the methodology developed by villi and bacchi 2001 for the piave river basin for the study region and the area considered in the current work the peak flow generated exceeded a return time of 200 years simulated peak discharges q max m3 s 1 are reported in table s2 for each sub reach along with unit peak discharges q max m3 s 1 km 2 the minimum and maximum unit peak discharges were 2 80 and 4 31 m3 s 1 km 2 in the tegnas in the angheraz valley sub reach t1 4 and the bordina sub catchment respectively fig 1 4 2 sediment water flows identified via field surveys 4 2 1 high magnitude flows occurring during the vaia storm the detailed survey of the vaia event deposits allowed brenna et al 2020 to determine the sediment water flows caused by the vaia storm at each sub reach fig 4 the following acronyms are used hereafter for the flow types examined in this work wf water flow dfd debris flood and dfw debris flow along the steep reach t1 of the tegnas torrent where slope ranges from 8 7 to 21 3 a progressive passage from dominant dfw to dfd and wf was documented at the first three sub reaches followed by dfw that affected two sub reaches i e t1 4 and t1 5 and dfd occurring at one sub reach i e t1 6 in the downstream section of the tegnas main stem with a slope ranging from 0 3 to 6 1 wf was the dominant flow type in most of the sub reaches from t2 to t6 but dfd occurred at sub reaches t2 4 t4 1 t4 2 t6 2 and t6 3 sub reaches t3 1 t3 2 t7 1 and t7 2 were excluded from the analysis because the vaia deposits were not observable dfws were detected in most of the steep tributaries but dfd occurred in the fagher stream bordina torrent and dell acqua stream no sub reach was classified by brenna et al 2020 as dominated by hyperconcentrated flow 4 2 2 ordinary flows the field evidence collected from deposits accumulated before the vaia storm forming the local stratigraphic record is reported in table s3 and the detailed field survey worksheets supporting information dfw deposits made up most of the stratigraphic record at sub reach t1 1 of the tegnas main stem at sub reaches t2 3 t2 4 t4 2 t4 4 and t4 5 pre vaia sediments were deposited primarily by wf most of the pre vaia deposits of the fagher fa1 1 civetta ci1 1 mez me1 1 and san lucano sl1 1 tributaries were mobilized by dfw the post vaia deposits fig 5 b are up to 0 6 m thick and are characterized by evidence diagnostic of wf with bedload transport see table s4 and the detailed field survey worksheets supporting information direct observations made during the august 2020 event confirmed the occurrence of wf at some locations along the tegnas main stem i e sub reaches t2 2 t2 4 t4 2 t4 3 t4 6 and t7 2 fig 5b with bed material partially entrained larger clasts were not mobilized and transported at low or moderate rates i e stage 2 of bedload sensu carling 1988 a video shot at reach t2 2 in proximity to the flood peak showing the flowing water and the transport conditions is included in the supporting information movie s1 section 4 2 3 comparison of vaia induced high magnitude flows and ordinary flows the combined surveys of pre and post vaia deposits allowed us to assemble a complete picture of the ordinary flow types occurring at the sub reach scale along the tegnas torrent main stem 20 sub reaches and four of its tributaries fig 5 the comparison of ordinary flows and high magnitude flows that occurred during the vaia storm fig 4 revealed that during the high magnitude flood the transport processes triggered along the stream network changed at nine sub reaches fig 6 table s5 along the tegnas main stem the most important flow type changes occurred at reach t1 where four sub reaches ordinarily affected by wf experienced dfd and dfw during the vaia storm in addition flows in sub reaches t2 4 t4 1 t4 2 and t6 3 were characterized by a change from ordinary wf to dfd among the tributaries no relevant changes occurred and only the fagher torrent that is ordinary affected by dfw experienced dfd during the vaia event 4 3 high magnitude sediment water flows predicted by morphometric analysis table s6 summarizes the morphometric parameters and melton s number of each sub reach the flow types expected to occur in response to high magnitude events were determined by applying at the sub reach scale the three morphometric approaches described in section 3 2 fig 3 as classified using the approach of marchi et al 1993 the flow expected in the sub reaches between t1 1 and t1 4 of the tegnas main stem was dfw that predicted in sub reaches t1 5 and t1 6 was mixed flow and that expected in all the downstream sub reaches was wf excluding sub reach t6 1 where the flow was categorized as mixed flow because of its high slope fig 7 a all the flows occurring in the steep tributaries were classified as dfws excluding those taking place in the bordina torrent which forming in its terminal portion a large fan with a moderate slope was classified as affected by mixed flow fig 7a flows predicted using the approach of bertrand et al 2013 fig 7b were equivalent to those determined via the approach of marchi et al 1993 but mixed flows were included in the dfw class the approach of wilford et al 2004 generated different results fig 7c all the sub reaches of the tegnas main stem including the sub reaches between t2 2 and t7 2 which had melton s numbers slightly higher than 0 3 i e the threshold between wfs and dfds were classified as affected by dfd the flows occurring in most of the tributaries were classified as dfw but those taking place in the bordina scandole and besaosega channels were placed in the dfd class 4 4 comparison of vaia flows and those predicted by morphometric analysis the vaia storm flows fig 4 differ from high magnitude flows predicted using the methods of marchi et al 1993 fig 7a bertrand et al 2013 fig 7b and wilford et al 2004 fig 7c at 11 8 and 19 sub reaches out of the 33 sub reaches considered in this work respectively fig 8 table s7 the melton s numbers and slope thresholds proposed by marchi et al 1993 were satisfactorily effective measures for classifying two end member processes with a 75 accordance between actually occurring and predicted high magnitude processes for wf nine out of 12 sub reaches and a 100 accordance for dfw nine out of nine sub reaches fig 8a contrariwise only two out of 10 sub reaches were classified in the field as affected by dfd falling under the mixed class fig 8a most of the discrepancies arose along the tegnas main stem where at five sub reaches i e t2 4 t4 1 t4 2 t6 2 t6 3 wf was predicted by the morphometric approach in reality dfd occurred during vaia for two tributaries fagher and dell acqua streams the approach of marchi et al 1993 predicted dfw but it was dfd that occurred during the storm other inconsistencies arose at reach t1 of the tegnas torrent for which the thresholds proposed by marchi et al 1993 yielded dfw as a unique process in contrast to the findings of the field survey which documented a complex coexistence of different flow types i e dfw dfd and wf as responses to the vaia storm the method put forward by bertrand et al 2013 exhibited the highest predictive success rate 23 31 sub reaches but at the price of a lower resolution as it merged intermediate sediment water transport processes which in alpine streams typically consist of dfd into dfw the discrepancies are the same as those highlighted above for the approach of marchi et al 1993 fig 8b the performance of the method developed by wilford et al 2004 i e predictive success verified in 12 out of the 31 sub reaches was undermined by its failure to identify wf channel reaches in the studied stream network with the approach classifying the entire tegnas main stem as affected by dfd fig 8c note that most of the wf sub reaches classified as dfd according to wilford et al s 2004 method had melton s numbers only slightly higher than the threshold i e 0 3 table s6 that separates wf from dfd discrepancies also occurred in the classification of processes at tributaries where the dfd occurring during vaia at fagher and dell acqua streams were not predicted by the morphometric approach 4 5 channel changes and hydraulic analysis of the flood 4 5 1 changes in channel width the recognition of channel boundaries from the 2015 and 2019 orthophotos allowed us to calculate the average width of the tegnas and bordina torrents before wpre and after wpost the vaia storm and to evaluate channel widening at the sub reach scale in consideration of the width ratio i e wr the ratio between wpost and wpre table 2 the smallest widening occurred at reach t1 with a wr ranging from 1 4 to 2 2 and where the tegnas channel was already of a considerable width before the event i e sub reaches t2 3 t2 4 and between t4 3 and t4 6 with a wr ranging from 1 2 to 1 9 at sub reaches t2 3 and t2 4 considerable water fluxes flowed onto the floodplain re entering the channel at sub reach t2 4 the largest widening occurred at partially confined reaches t6 and t7 with a wr up to 5 7 and at sub reaches t2 1 t2 2 t4 1 and t4 2 with a wr up to 4 1 located in unconfined reaches t2 and t4 which had a narrow channel before the flood at these sub reaches channel widening affected large portions of the floodplain and locally the slopes of the valley intermediate widening occurred in sub reaches located in partially confined reaches t3 and t5 with a wr ranging from 2 1 to 2 7 where the channel widened during the event taking up the entire floodplain among the sub reaches considered in this analysis the terminal portion of the bordina torrent was affected by the most remarkable widening wr 6 1 4 5 2 unit stream power the pre and post flood unit stream power values ωpk pre and ωpk post respectively were computed eq 1 at the sub reaches dominated by wf and dfd during the vaia storm the flow density was always considered equal to 1000 kg m 3 i e clearwater density this choice could imply an underestimation of the flow density at some sub reaches but we consider it acceptable because of the low amount of fine sediment transportable in suspension recognized in the stream network and the dominance of bedload transport of coarse particles for wf and dfd processes the results are summarized in table 2 because of channel widening the ωpk pre values were always higher than the ωpk post values the highest ωpk values were obtained at narrow sub reaches i e t3 1 t3 2 and t4 1 with ωpk pre up to 13 300 w m 2 ωpk post up to 6100 w m 2 and at reaches t5 and t6 with ωpk pre up to 12 200 w m 2 ωpk post up to 3900 w m 2 which are characterized by a high streambed slope 5 discussion 5 1 high magnitude flow types and relationships with stream power and channel response along the main stem of the tegnas torrent sediment mobilization occurs ordinarily as wf with more or less intense bedload transport with dfw typically occurring in steep tributaries fig 5 according to the paroxysmal nature of dfd hungr 2005 church and jakob 2020 no sub reach is characterized by the ordinary occurrence of such a flow during the vaia storm recurrence interval of about 200 years the processes that affected the stream network i e wf and dfw but also dfd fig 4 considerably changed in comparison to ordinary processes at several channel sites fig 6 no sub reach was dominated by hyperconcentrated flow according with the lack of a substrate prone to produce fine grained deposits e g crosta and frattini 2004 rickenmann and koschni 2010 along the tegnas torrent three sub reaches limited to reach t1 were affected by dfw during the vaia storm fig 4 in these sub reaches sediment gravity flows originated from the steep slopes of the catchment head and in steep tributaries flowing directly into the main stem or was caused by the material injected into the channel from landslides originating from the flanks of the angheraz valley brenna et al 2020 to comprehensively analyze the processes triggered during the vaia storm an appropriate strategy is to consider the different types of dfd occurring during the storm because these phenomena as recently stated by church and jakob 2020 can be generated by various processes a dfd can be 1 meteorologically generated if triggered by the exceedance of a critical stress acting on a streambed given a severe hydrological event type 1 2 generated by the progressive dilution of a dfw by sedimentation or the injection of water type 2 and 3 triggered by the collapse of artificial or natural dams type 3 following the typology proposed by church and jakob 2020 at four sub reaches of the tegnas main stem i e t1 2 t1 6 t4 1 and t4 2 the processes were classified as type 2 dfd because their deposits were located immediately downstream from channel portions affected by dfw during the event such dfds are part of longitudinal triplets of flow transition consisting of a downstream evolution from dfw to dfd and finally to wf as occurring for instance at sub reaches t1 1 dfw dominated t1 2 dfd dominated and t1 3 wf dominated at the remaining sub reaches i e t2 4 t6 2 and t6 3 dfds were classified as type 1 dfds given that they arose at channel sites where neither dfw nor dam collapses occurred immediately upstream dfd also occurred at fagher bordina and dell acqua tributaries for which the ordinary flow responsible for sediment mobilization was determined only at fa1 1 i e dfw allowing us to identify the occurrence of an anomalous dfd during the event the fluid gravity flows induced by the vaia storm i e wf and dfd dfw were excluded because stream power is an ineffective metric for describing a sediment gravity flow were analyzed taking into account unit stream power table 2 specifically we considered pre flood unit stream power ωpk pre because it was acknowledged to be closer to the actual stream power that occurred at the flood peak surian et al 2016 the ωpk pre calculated at sub reaches where wf occurred ranged from 1000 to 5500 w m 2 fig 9 with two outliers sub reaches t5 2 and t6 1 characterized by considerably higher ωpk pre the ωpk pre values determined for the sub reaches affected by type 2 dfd were in the same range whereas the ωpk pre values of the sub reaches affected by type 1 dfd were significantly higher extending from 5000 to 10 000 w m 2 fig 9 with an exception represented by sub reach t2 4 i e a ωpk pre of about 1150 w m 2 previous works highlighted the possible occurrence of abnormally intense transport phenomena that can affect a stream during a severe hydrological event baker 1977 rickenmann and koschni 2010 borga et al 2014 bodoque et al 2015 rinaldi et al 2016 jakob et al 2017 accordingly the high magnitude flood that hit the tegnas torrent in october 2018 produced processes fig 4 remarkably different from those occurring under ordinary hydrological conditions fig 5 nevertheless the upheaval of the transport processes did not occur throughout the stream network fig 6 at 12 sub reaches the flows triggered during the vaia storm remained in the field of wf at such sub reaches which are characterized by a low slope and or an already wide channel before the event as for instance in most of reaches t2 and t4 the ωpk pre was usually lower than 5500 w m 2 with flow energy unable to fully mobilize streambed material the widening was low or moderate at these sub reaches fig 10 a and b water flow energy was able to induce localized dfd type 1 at sub reaches scattered along the stream network where the ωpk pre was higher than about 5000 to 5500 w m 2 along the tegnas torrent such increment in unit stream power occurred at sites characterized by high slopes and or at the narrowest sections of the stream e g sub reaches t6 2 t6 3 in correspondence of steep and narrow channel portions we also observed the greatest channel widenings after the event table 2 with a wr of 5 7 at sub reach t6 2 fig 10c and d and a wr of 6 1 at bo1 1 fig 10e and f other sub reaches were affected by type 2 dfd related to the upstream occurrence of a dfw at such channel locations the water flow energy i e a ωpk pre of 3000 4000 w m 2 would not have been able to fully mobilize an entire streambed which was exposed to live bed conditions severe stage 3 of bedload sensu carling 1988 thanks to the kinetic energy and mobile sediment transfer provided by a dfw cf church and jakob 2020 three exceptions emerged from the aforementioned analysis fig 9 two exceptions occur at sub reaches t5 2 and t6 1 where although estimated ωpk pre was much higher than the threshold of 5000 to 5500 w m 2 identified as significant for inducing type 1 dfd at the tegnas torrent fig 9 surveyed deposits point out to occurrence of wf by definition the shift from wf to dfd requires that in the absence of sediment input from upstream as in the case of debris flow dilution grains of almost all sizes of a streambed become fully mobile hungr et al 2014 church and jakob 2020 the mobility of gravel and cobbles can be limited by the presence of boulders if the finer fractions are hidden by coarse particles lenzi et al 2006b comiti and mao 2012 church 2013 mackenzie et al 2018 accordingly at sub reaches t5 2 and t6 1 the localized presence of mega boulders with a diameter up to 3 5 m coming from glacial deposits locally cut by the channel see the geological map available in the supporting information section of brenna et al s 2020 work that were not mobilized during the event the maximum grain size of mobilized clasts being approximately 1 1 5 m table 2 may have inhibited the establishment of a dfd by limiting the overall mobility of streambed material fig 11 a we cannot exclude however that dfds occurred at sub reaches t5 2 and t6 1 but their deposits could have been later removed reworked and or washed out by water flows afterward occurred at the same sites the third exception occurred at sub reach t2 4 where type 1 dfd occurred with a relatively low ωpk pre 1150 w m 2 at sub reach t2 3 considerable water fluxes flowed onto the floodplain it is reasonable to hypothesize that the water flowing onto the floodplain entrained large amounts of fine material i e mud sand and organic debris as suggested by the erosion evidence i e gullies observed on the overbank area adjacent to the channel fig 11b the fine material was injected into the flow at sub reach t2 4 where the overflowing water re entered the channel fig 11b the entrainment of fine material transported in suspension may have locally induced a significant increment in the density of the water flowing at sub reach t2 4 a fluid highly charged with suspended sediment with a bulk density considerably higher than 1000 kg m 3 e g 1500 1600 kg m 3 or higher as reported by middleton and hampton 1973 and shanmugam 1996 can more easily mobilize streambed particles by inducing higher stress on the bed than would normally be accomplished by a clearwater flow therefore the ωpk pre calculated at sub reach t2 4 with consideration for clearwater density could not be an effective metric for describing a peculiar case of high density flow highly charged with suspended sediment possibly a plastic hyperconcentrated flow locally promoting the triggering of a dfd church and jackob 2020 highlighted that a flood might be locally both a dfd and hyperconcentrated flow and invoked a similar phenomenon i e an abrupt increase in fluid bulk density as one of the mobilization mechanisms responsible for dfd generation channel widening occurred along the entire stream network during the vaia storm table 2 and fig 10 the ωpk pre was positively correlated with wr fig 12 in accordance with the findings of previous works e g surian et al 2016 righini et al 2017 scorpio et al 2018 that identified ωpk pre as the most significant hydraulic parameter for explaining channel widening as regards wr with high ωpk pre values we observed that the sub reaches affected by dfd t4 1 t6 2 t6 3 bo1 1 experienced a much larger widening in respect of the sub reaches where wf occurred at the same unit stream power t5 1 t5 2 t6 1 fig 12 such extraordinary widenings characterizing dfd affected channel sites accord with the extensive bank erosion reported by church and jakob 2020 as a signal of dfd occurrence related to the live bed condition moreover we speculated that bank erosion provided fresh debris that could be more easily mobilized in sediment water flow and in the case of banks containing a significant percentage of cohesive material as with glacial tills injections of fine sediment transportable as suspended load which increased the density of a flowing fluid the unit stream power and consequently its transport competence such processes could cause a positive feedback loop on the conditions promoting a dfd at a channel site as possibly occurring at sub reaches t6 2 and t6 3 where the flow density and the unit stream power may have been slightly higher than those calculated with consideration for clearwater density table 2 under these premises the presence of erodible banks and therefore a floodplain adjacent to a channel could represent a condition that facilitates the occurrence of dfd under adequate hydrological conditions future studies focusing on channel responses to extreme floods should consider in addition to hydraulic e g ωpk and morphological e g pre event channel width and lateral confinement constraints the different sediment water flows as possible controlling factors for channel modifications e g widening 5 2 performance of the morphometric approaches in predicting the high magnitude flows some discrepancies were found between the vaia sediment water flows determined on the basis of the surveyed deposits brenna et al 2020 and the high magnitude transport phenomena predicted at the sub reach scale using a semi distributed application of the morphometric approaches fig 8 ninety three comparisons were carried out between the processes predicted by the three morphometric approaches and the flows that occurred during the vaia storm i e 31 sub reaches multiplied by three morphometric approaches for 18 out of the 36 cases where wf should have been expected the three morphometric methods correctly predicted the occurrence of wf success rate of 50 the same predictive success rate was obtained for the sub reaches dominated by dfd in 22 out of the 27 cases where dfw should have been expected the approaches correctly indicated that this flow type would take place success rate of 81 the morphometric methods satisfactorily classify the sub reaches of a mountain stream dominated by sediment gravity flows in response to a high magnitude hydrological event by contrast they often in 50 of cases fail to identify sites where intermediate processes i e dfd in the case study network may occur it deserves to be stressed that whereas the morphometric approaches have the advantage of limited data requirements and easy application in the first order discrimination of expectable high magnitude flow processes they are affected by some simplifications which limit their local classification effectiveness especially for mountain catchments with complex morphometry and geological settings first these methods do not take into account the connectivity of sediment sources and the characteristics of streambed sediments thus disregarding sediment availability and channel material mobility at the channel reach scale such a shortcoming influences the effectiveness of these methods in classifying the sites dominated by dfd because the occurrence of such intermediate transport phenomena is determined by a broad spectrum of geomorphological features along with the localized availability of sediment than can be entrained by the flow an example found in our work is the occurrence of type 2 dfd induced by the injection of dfw from tributaries into the tegnas torrent fig 4 as occurring at sub reaches t4 1 and t4 2 for these sites marchi et al 1993 and bertrand et al 2013 predicted the occurrence of wf fig 7 although this limitation is not especially harmful for the recognition of the long term flow response at the catchment scale which was the original aim of these methods it may be detrimental to the assessment of the local flow response of a specific event furthermore morphometric approaches disregard hydrological conditions and the peculiar relationships that can occur between water discharge and sediment availability during a high magnitude flood a peculiar case of discordance between morphometric prediction and the flow that effectively occurred during the vaia storm is represented by the fagher torrent fa1 1 where dfw was the ordinary process determined from field analysis fig 5a as well as from the three morphometric approaches fig 7 but the flow that occurred during the vaia storm was classified as dfd fig 4 at this sub reach an anomalous downgrading from ordinary and expected dfw to dfd occurred during the high magnitude event the fagher torrent because of its geological and morphometric characteristics likely experienced a sediment supply limited condition recking 2012 church 2013 theule et al 2015 during the vaia storm in relation to the high flow transport capacity generated by the exceptional water discharge table s2 the occurrence of a dfw was inhibited by the dilution of entrained particles in a large amount of flowing water this example shows that during a high magnitude event the shift from one type of flow to another does not necessarily occur as an upgrade of transport phenomena intended as an increment in solid concentration in sediment water flow in fact downgrades e g from dfw to dfd in particular circumstances e g sediment supply limited conditions are also possible finally the representations of catchment morphometry adopted in most of the morphometric approaches are very simplified taking into account basin relief and area fan or channel slope e g marchi et al 1993 bertrand et al 2013 or basin length e g wilford et al 2004 as already noted by jackson et al 1987 low slope reaches in stepped longitudinal channel profiles may prevent debris flows from reaching a catchment outlet the presence of such low slope channel reaches is undetectable by a lumped ruggedness index such as melton s number the tegnas torrent is characterized by a longitudinal profile fig 4 with some sectors having a relatively low gradient e g most of the reaches t2 and t4 the melton s number computed with consideration for the total elevation range in the drainage catchment i e from 2870 m a s l to 600 800 m a s l of the valley floor as already noted by marchi et al 1993 does not consider the role of such low gradient channel reaches leading to an overestimation of the longitudinal sediment transfer and processes involving considerable coarse material transport moreover the thresholds of morphometric parameters adopted for classification purposes are empirical and developed for a specific geographical region for instance the melton s number threshold of 0 3 identified by wilford et al 2004 for the canadian rocky mountains to distinguish wf from dfd does not fit with the field based flow recognition at the tegnas torrent this issue less strongly affects the morphometric thresholds of marchi et al 1993 which was developed with the eastern italian alps in mind and bertrand et al 2013 which was based on a large dataset that included several alpine regions this confirms the importance of adapting morphometric thresholds for different regional conditions 6 conclusion and implications for flood hazard assessment our work focused on the comparison of high magnitude sediment water flows caused by a severe flood on a mountain catchment with ordinary flows we observed that high magnitude hydrological events induce a broad spectrum of sediment water flows i e wf dfd and dfw that can remarkably differ from those activated during ordinary floods research question 1 the most important flow type change during high magnitude events is the shift from ordinary wf to dfd nevertheless the upheaval of ordinary flow types during a high magnitude flood requires some conditions that do not necessarily occur in the entire stream network research question 2 we inferred the existence of relationships among the sediment water flow types triggered during the high magnitude event hydraulic forcing geomorphological processes some boundary conditions as the morphological setting and the sediment availability and mobility of a channel site dfd seems to occur in response to hydrological forcing that generates ωpk pre that exceeds about 5500 w m 2 fig 9 or downstream of dfw channels delivering large amounts of sediment to a receiving stream table s8 in a mountain stream such as the tegnas torrent the occurrence of such conditions is promoted at channel sites characterized by high slopes and or the narrowest sections of the stream and downstream of steep tributaries prone to dfw occurrence and well connected to a receiving stream dfd seems to cause a higher channel widening than that generated by wf fig 12 and are characterized by peculiar hazard characteristics and interaction with infrastructures wilford et al 2004 borga et al 2014 church and jakob 2020 for these reasons a crucial requirement is to improve our capability on predicting at the local scale the channel sites of a mountain stream prone to dfd occurrence in response to a severe hydrological event the adoption of three morphometric approaches employed in a semi distributed manner to predict the high magnitude flow types characterizing the stream network at the sub reach scale allowed us to conclude that such methods exhibit good performance with respect to sites affected by dfw these approaches displayed diminished effectiveness in predicting the flow type on sites affected by dfd research question 3 topography based methods developed for specific geographical settings adequately enable the first order discrimination of expectable processes for planning purposes the complex relationships found between flow types and hydraulic morphological and geological controlling factors revealed that a more detailed characterization of a stream network at the sub reach scale is necessary to understand the high magnitude transport mechanisms that can affect specific channel sites during severe to extreme hydrological events to consider the aforementioned factors promoting or hindering the dfd occurrence together with an analysis of slope dynamics sediment sources and connectivity represents a step

4191,sediment transfer in mountain streams occurs via processes classified as debris flows hyperconcentrated flows debris floods and water flows under the control of the water energy and the amount of involved sediment despite the extensive documentation of the channel changes caused by high magnitude hydrological events the analysis of the sediment water flows occurring during such floods is currently a minimally explored issue this study investigated how the transport mechanisms activated in a mountain stream during a high magnitude flood differ from those triggered during ordinary floods it also evaluated the effectiveness of three morphometric approaches in predicting high magnitude flows expectable in a channel sub reach the study area is the tegnas catchment dolomites italy a mountain basin affected in 2018 by a severe hydrological event vaia storm whose recurrence interval is approximately 200 years we determined the transport processes typifying the stream network in the catchment during ordinary floods through field surveys and direct monitoring and compared these flows with the high magnitude flow types that occurred during the vaia storm additionally we examined the flows predicted using the morphometric approaches for high magnitude events we observed water flow as a response to ordinary events occurring along the entire tegnas main stem whereas debris flow ordinarily determines sediment transfer at steep tributaries during the vaia storm water flow still dominated along the tegnas torrent although debris flows and debris floods were also documented at several sub reaches of the main stem the morphometric approaches satisfactorily predicted debris flows but often failed to recognize the debris floods occurred during the high magnitude 2018 flooding the analysis of different flow types enabled us to infer relationships among transport mechanisms hydraulic forcing and channel dynamics and to gain new insights on the poorly explored debris flood processes water flows transitioned into debris floods under unit stream powers exceeding the threshold of 5000 to 5500 w m 2 or downstream of sediment injection points the occurrence of debris floods which caused higher channel widening than that induced by water flows appeared to be facilitated by the presence of tributaries prone to debris flow occurrence connected to a receiving stream the injection of fine material into the flows and channels characterized by high slope and narrow section the morphometric approaches enabled adequate first order discrimination of expectable high magnitude flows but a more detailed characterization that includes field observations is necessary to understand the transport mechanisms that can affect a specific channel site during high

work is that during high magnitude floods e g floods with recurrence intervals higher than 50 100 years the mechanisms of sediment transfer occurring at a channel location i e high magnitude sediment water flows or high magnitude flows in this study can significantly differ from those occurring in response to ordinary floods flooding with recurrence intervals of up to a number of years i e ordinary sediment water flows or ordinary flows in this study the validation of this hypothesis would represent a step toward understanding how the geomorphic work performed by high magnitude flows fits within the long term evolution of the mountain stream channels the term high magnitude flow is used in this work to define the most intense transport phenomenon occurring at a stream location during a high magnitude flood regarded as the process that involves the highest sediment concentration in sediment water flow the case study selected to validate the research hypothesis is the tegnas catchment dolomites italy which was affected in october 2018 by a severe rainstorm i e the so called vaia storm that caused considerable flooding in the mountain streams of northeastern italy pellegrini et al 2021 highlighted the occurrence of windthrows landslides and debris flows affecting the tegnas catchment slopes and the remarkable morphological changes that occurred along the entire channel network of the catchment brenna et al 2020 focused on transport processes and identified through the survey of flood deposits the high magnitude sediment water flows triggered by the vaia storm along the tegnas torrent and its tributaries in the current study the flows induced by the vaia storm were compared with 1 the flows normally active along the channel network during ordinary floods 2 the flows predicted using three morphometric approaches developed to determine high magnitude flow types moreover the transport processes induced by the vaia storm were analyzed through an integrated approach in which consideration was directed toward geomorphological dynamics and the hydraulic constraints that occurred during the event we paid specific attention to the investigation of debris floods that have been rarely explored in the literature church and jakob 2020 the research questions addressed are as follows 1 to what extent do sediment water flows that are activated during a high magnitude event differ from ordinary flows 2 what are the controlling factors and key geomorphological processes that induce changes in flow types e g from water flow to debris flood during high magnitude events 3 are morphometric approaches reliable tools for locally i e at the sub reach spatial scale predicting flows that occur in response to high magnitude floods in mountain streams 2 general setting 2 1 study area the tegnas catchment extends over the dolomites eastern italian alps and covers an area of 51 km2 with a maximum elevation of 2872 m a s l and a minimum elevation of 620 m a s l fig 1 the tegnas torrent is a right tributary of the cordevole river piave river catchment its major tributary is the bordina torrent but several streams flow into the tegnas from the slopes of the mountains that border the catchment the main characteristics of the investigated channel network are summarized in table 1 the valley floor extends in width up to 490 m and is underlain by alluvial glacial and slope deposits testa et al 2013 the tegnas basin is characterized by an alpine climate with cold winters and temperate summers during winter precipitation occurs as snow but most annual precipitation occurs during spring and late autumn a 30 year mean annual precipitation of 1620 mm is reported for the col di prà monitoring station fig 1 testa and aldighieri 2011 estimated a formative discharge of about 15 m3 s 1 recurrence interval of 1 5 years for the main stem of the tegnas torrent the lithology of the catchment consists mostly of dolostone and limestone associated with siliciclastic clay rich rocks and volcanic rocks limited to the bordina sub catchment giordano 2011 testa et al 2013 lucianetti et al 2016 land cover is mainly broadleaf and coniferous forest in the lower part of the catchment and carbonate outcrops occur at an elevation higher than about 1500 m a s l anthropic structures i e roads houses are present only along the valley floor in the village of taibon agordino near the confluence with the cordevole river the tegnas torrent is channelized by artificial levees other artificial structures are levees located along some reaches of the tegnas main stem a sediment retention check dam located along the tegnas immediately upstream of the confluence of the bordina torrent built with a narrow opening and already filled with sediment before the vaia storm marchi et al 2019 and a few small check dams on the tributaries we analyzed the transport processes taking place along the main stem of the tegnas torrent and the downstream reaches i e near the confluence with the tegnas of its nine tributaries fig 1 brenna et al 2020 divided the stream network into reaches brierley and fryirs 2005 rinaldi et al 2013 and sub reaches that are 200 to 500 m long and feature homogeneous channel slopes ferencevic and ashmore 2012 data collection and analysis were conducted at the sub reach scale seven homogeneous reaches named t1 to t7 were defined along the tegnas main stem fig 1 reach t1 characterized by a high slope s 8 7 21 3 and strong lateral confinement flows along the angheraz valley whereas reaches t2 to t7 flow within the san lucano valley downstream reaches have lower slopes s 0 3 6 1 and confinement classes defined by brenna et al 2020 considering the confinement index rinaldi et al 2013 rinaldi et al 2014 that vary from partially confined i e reaches t3 t5 t6 and t7 to unconfined i e reaches t2 and t4 classes all the terminal portions of the tributaries are characterized by steep s 13 0 39 1 and confined channels except for the bordina torrent which formed a large fan with a slope of 6 3 2 2 the vaia storm between 27 and 30 october 2018 the vaia storm characterized by a combination of extreme wind and precipitation affected most of italy and intensified over the mountain areas of the eastern italian alps the storm developed as an explosive cyclogenesis following the input of a cold air mass into the western mediterranean cavaleri et al 2019 giovannini et al 2021 the precipitation over the tegnas catchment lasted 67 h starting on october 27 at 6 20 cet and ending on october 29 at 21 40 cet with two intense phases of precipitation separated by a precipitation hiatus the first rainfall phase peaked on the evening of 28 october and was characterized by the largest accumulation while the second phase peaked on the evening of 29 october and was typified by the highest rainfall intensity precipitation accumulation in the study area exceeded 600 mm and was among the highest recorded for the storm event in northeastern italy fig 2 reports the cumulated precipitation over the entire event 27 30 october for the cordevole catchment closed at ponte mas with a drainage area of 704 km2 out of a total of 851 km2 showing a precipitation peak over the tegnas catchment 3 materials and methods 3 1 characterization of high magnitude and ordinary sediment water flows through field evidence brenna et al 2020 developed a post event survey protocol to collect field evidence aimed at classifying flood deposits in mountain streams on the basis of the type of flow i e debris flow hyperconcentrated flow debris flood and water flow that deposits sediment the authors identified diagnostic criteria for detecting different sediment water flows on the basis of the morphological and sedimentological features of related deposits brenna et al 2020 applied the criteria summarized in table s1 to identify the high magnitude sediment water flows triggered by the vaia storm along the main stem of the tegnas torrent and its tributaries the same channels were also considered in this work because of the severity of the vaia induced flood at the tegnas catchment the flows triggered by this storm were considered representative of the most intense water sediment transport processes that can occur in the studied channels the survey and interpretation protocol defined by brenna et al 2020 was employed during additional surveys conducted in the current work to address the classification of other deposits i e excluding the vaia deposits along the tegnas stream network two types of deposits were considered and interpreted 1 older sediments deposited before the vaia storm pre vaia deposits hereafter and 2 recent sediments deposited after the vaia storm post vaia deposits hereafter for each sub reach we aimed at identifying one or more representative survey sites where the pre and or post vaia deposits were recognizable and their features could be characterized fig s1 we considered sites with exposed sections of about 2 10 m2 a worksheet for the field survey of the deposits brenna et al 2020 was compiled for each survey site collecting morphological and sedimentological characteristics the flow type responsible for the sedimentation of the deposits was identified as the flow type with the highest volume of recognized characteristics calculated as the percentage of evidence detected during the survey with respect to the number of evidence considered in the worksheet for each flow type the local stratigraphic record at a site of an alluvial channel can consist of interspersed deposits ascribable to different flow types e g blair 1999 it is reasonable to assume that the process building up the majority of sediment accumulation is not related to high magnitude hydrological events which can mobilize high volumes of material but at low frequencies but to flow types that ordinarily determine sediment dynamics and consequently the morphological setting of an alluvial reach church 2006 analogous to the concept of effective water discharge wolman and miller 1960 biedenharn et al 2001 the process that builds up most of the local stratigraphic record can be related to ordinary hydrological events with recurrence intervals ranging from 1 5 to 10 years in a mountain stream andrews 1980 lenzi et al 2006a surian et al 2009 rinaldi et al 2014 such assumptions are valid for alluvial stream networks in which multiple flow types can occur in light of these considerations the classification of deposits that form most local stratigraphic accumulations based on deposit thickness considering 1 2 m stretches of exposed sections at the survey sites as products of debris flow hyperconcentrated flow debris flood and water flow allowed us to determine the flow type that ordinarily affects a site of the stream network the survey of pre vaia deposits distinguished from vaia deposits using evidence such as stratigraphic position the presence of immobilized root systems and the presence of soils at the top of these deposits was conducted in july august 2019 mainly with an examination of sedimentological indicators because the original morphologies of these deposits were typically unpreserved e g reworked by later flows or unobservable fig s1a the transport processes occurring during the vaia storm eroded mobilized and deposited large volumes of sediment brenna et al 2020 pellegrini et al 2021 thereby causing the analysis of older deposits challenging and possible only at some sub reaches some low magnitude floods occurred after the vaia storm at the tegnas catchment we considered the sediments deposited by two ordinary hydrological events that occurred in august and october 2020 with maximum water discharges of about 8 to 10 m3 s 1 which were measured along the tegnas torrent at taibon agordino these values are slightly lower than the formative discharge of 15 m3 s 1 estimated by testa and aldighieri 2011 for the tegnas torrent analysis and interpretations of post vaia deposits were focused on the tegnas main stem and carried out immediately after event occurrence i e september and november 2020 moreover the transport phenomena were directly observed during the 30 august 2020 event at some key points of the stream network the flow types recognized from such surveys were regarded similar to the processes inferred from the stratigraphic record as representative of the ordinary flows characterizing each sub reach of the stream 3 2 catchment morphometrics for determining flow types as responses to high magnitude events morphometric parameters are powerful indicators for predicting the sediment water flows occurring in response to high magnitude events in mountain catchments kostaschuk et al 1986 jackson et al 1987 marchi et al 1993 calvache et al 1997 sorriso valvo et al 1998 marchi and brochot 2000 de scally and owens 2004 wilford et al 2004 santangelo et al 2012 bertrand et al 2013 high magnitude flow types are related to morphometric indexes such as the channel slope watershed length and melton s number i e the ratio of catchment relief to the square root of a catchment area melton 1965 the methods cited in this paragraph were originally intended to be applied at the catchment scale that is to detect expected flow types at the outlet of a catchment e g at a fan apex in the present study we explored the effectiveness of morphometric indices in detecting flow types that occur in response to a high magnitude event not only at the catchment outlet as originally intended but also at different channel locations of a mountain stream through an original semi distributed application of such methods to determine the expected high magnitude flow type at the 35 sub reaches analyzed in this work table 1 we employed three morphometric approaches which were proposed by marchi et al 1993 wilford et al 2004 and bertrand et al 2013 marchi et al 1993 analyzed 58 channels of the eastern italian alps classifying flow processes into debris flows mixed flows and fluvial flows synonymous to water flows in channels classified as mixed flows both debris and water flows occur during high magnitude events but debris floods are often the dominant process bertrand et al 2013 adopted a similar approach but used a larger world dataset and performed a simple binary classification that distinguishes channels where debris including mixed flow cases and fluvial flows occur in response to high magnitude events the approaches of marchi et al 1993 and bertrand et al 2013 uncovered significant relationships among high magnitude flow types fan or channel slope and the melton s number fig 3 a and b differently from marchi et al 1993 who proposed empirical thresholds of fan slope and melton s number bertrand et al 2013 based the discrimination between the flow types on a rigorous statistical analysis wilford et al 2004 proposed a different method on the grounds of the results obtained for 65 canadian streams they considered three flow types i e debris flows water flows and debris floods and concluded that the melton s number and watershed length i e the distance from the fan apex to the most distant point on a watershed boundary are the most appropriate morphometric attributes for differentiation between channels affected by different high magnitude processes fig 3c the morphometric parameters required to apply the three morphometric approaches i e drainage area maximum and minimum elevations of a drainage area local channel slope and watershed length were determined for each sub reach of the stream network using a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 5 m and a vertical error of approximately 0 5 m https idt2 regione veneto it 3 3 hydrological analysis radar rainfall observations from the c band monte grande antenna located at a distance of 60 km from the basin of interest combined with data from 54 rain gauges provided high temporal 20 min and spatial 1 km2 representations of rainfall from the vaia storm over the cordevole catchment closed at ponte mas 704 km2 which encompasses the tegnas catchment a number of procedures were applied to the reflectivity data to correct the following error sources ground clutter partial beam occlusion path attenuation and wind drift the dynamic bias correction method cole and moore 2008 was used to combine radar based rainfall estimates and rain gauge measurements the assessment of flood response in ungauged catchments such as the tegnas which cannot be based on stream gauge data can be performed through flood forensic analyses borga et al 2019 these analyses involve 1 surveying post flood river reach topography and high water marks 2 applying one or two dimensional hydraulic models and 3 comparing results with outcomes from radar based hydrological models of flood response gaume and borga 2008 the sequence of two rainfall events which occurred on 27 28 and 29 october after a prolonged dry and warm period brought forth two distinct discharge peaks the first peak was relatively moderate as it was controlled by the very low initial soil moisture conditions whereas the second phase was characterized by extreme rain rates falling over wet soils which generated extreme peak discharges hydrologic response to the vaia storm was examined using a grid based spatially distributed hydrologic model termed the gris grid based runoff simulation model the distributed model requires raster information on landscape topography as well as soil geology and vegetation properties the model was run in conjunction with the probability distributed model pdm moore 2007 which was applied in a grid by grid manner to derive a spatially distributed representation of runoff generating processes and a simple description of drainage system response da ros and borga 1997 was used to represent runoff propagation using a kinematic model the pdm requires the specification of a number of parameters and chiefly the estimation of the maximum storage capacity that yields the spatially distributed soil water storage capacity the procedure for determining distributed runoff propagation is based on the identification of drainage paths and requires the characterization of hillslope paths and channeled paths as well as the specification of two invariant hillslope and channel velocities hillslope and channeled flow paths are determined using the drainage threshold area parameter the maximum storage capacity was estimated on the basis of available information concerning the different geological formations of the catchment information that was retrieved from official geo lithological maps different lithological types were grouped into five classes ranging from low to high permeability following norbiato et al 2009 the gris model parameters were calibrated simultaneously over multiple catchments on the grounds of available hydrological data on the vaia flooding over the cordevole basin a combination of manual and automatic calibration was conducted to minimize integrated normalized flood peak errors the geological information encompassed data on two catchments equipped with stream gauge sections and seven catchments where flood peaks were indirectly estimated via a post flood survey the gris model was implemented calibrated and validated over the upper cordevole basin by using data from multiple post event surveys and two stream gauge stations which recorded the flood hydrographs for two headwater basins this allowed a robust identification of the model parameters the application of the model to the tegnas catchment provided a simulated peak discharge of 167 m3 s 1 which corresponds to the upper limit of the uncertainty bound 3 4 calculation of stream power the unit stream power bagnold 1977 bagnold 1980 induced by water flow on a streambed can advance the analysis of coarse sediment dynamics and geomorphological processes in channels where fluid gravity flows occur e g magilligan 1992 costa and o connor 1995 ferguson 2005 comiti and mao 2012 magilligan et al 2015 surian et al 2016 the unit stream power is defined as follows 1 ω ρ g q s w where ρ denotes the water density 1000 kg m 3 g represents the gravity acceleration 9 81 m s 2 q is the water discharge m3 s 1 s is the local channel slope m m and w is the channel width m we used eq 1 to calculate the unit stream power during the peak of the vaia flooding ωpk on the tegnas main stem and the bordina torrent at sub reaches dominated by water flows and debris floods where the flows were newtonian and the sediment mobilization was mainly water driven sub reaches affected by debris flows or hyperconcentrated flows were excluded from ωpk calculation since the unit stream power is not an appropriate metrics for describing sediment gravity and plastic flows maximum water discharge qmax was computed by applying the calibrated rainfall runoff model to the examination at the sub reach scale the slope of the channel sub reach s was derived from the dem we employed two aerial orthophotographs with a resolution of 0 2 m acquired in 2015 and 2019 by the veneto region to determine the mean channel width of each sub reach before wpre and after wpost the vaia storm the 2015 and 2019 channels were digitized in arcgis 10 5 and the average channel widths were calculated as the ratio between the area spanning the channel sub reach and its length given that the channel width at the flood peak is unknown as with other works e g surian et al 2016 righini et al 2017 the unit stream power for the vaia flooding was calculated using eq 1 with both wpre pre flood unit stream power ωpk pre and wpost post flood unit stream power ωpk post as channel width w the unit stream power at the flood peak ωpk had a value falling between ωpk pre and ωpk post 4 results 4 1 rainfall and peak discharge in the tegnas catchment the precipitation estimation yielded areal cumulative rainfall over the tegnas amounting to 563 mm with 1 km2 maxima of 73 2 166 7 and 679 3 mm over one hour over three consecutive hours and the entire event respectively these max rainfall values were characterized by very high return periods all exceeding 200 years as determined using generalized extreme value gev distribution jenkinson 1955 implemented using l moments following norbiato et al 2007 the indirect peak discharge of the vaia storm estimated under the assumption of critical flow at a water diversion weir in the downstream part of the tegnas torrent sub reach t6 3 with a drainage area of 49 km2 fig 1 amounted to 154 m3 s 1 the upper and lower error bounds of 167 and 134 m3 s 1 respectively were identified to take into account uncertainties in the recognition of high water marks which were also influenced by intense sediment transport the application of the gris model in a multi catchment manner uncovered at the same outlet a simulated peak discharge of 167 m3 s 1 which corresponds to the upper limit of the uncertainty bound and testifies to the consistency of the post event discharge reconstruction with modeling a severity assessment was carried out for this peak flow using the methodology developed by villi and bacchi 2001 for the piave river basin for the study region and the area considered in the current work the peak flow generated exceeded a return time of 200 years simulated peak discharges q max m3 s 1 are reported in table s2 for each sub reach along with unit peak discharges q max m3 s 1 km 2 the minimum and maximum unit peak discharges were 2 80 and 4 31 m3 s 1 km 2 in the tegnas in the angheraz valley sub reach t1 4 and the bordina sub catchment respectively fig 1 4 2 sediment water flows identified via field surveys 4 2 1 high magnitude flows occurring during the vaia storm the detailed survey of the vaia event deposits allowed brenna et al 2020 to determine the sediment water flows caused by the vaia storm at each sub reach fig 4 the following acronyms are used hereafter for the flow types examined in this work wf water flow dfd debris flood and dfw debris flow along the steep reach t1 of the tegnas torrent where slope ranges from 8 7 to 21 3 a progressive passage from dominant dfw to dfd and wf was documented at the first three sub reaches followed by dfw that affected two sub reaches i e t1 4 and t1 5 and dfd occurring at one sub reach i e t1 6 in the downstream section of the tegnas main stem with a slope ranging from 0 3 to 6 1 wf was the dominant flow type in most of the sub reaches from t2 to t6 but dfd occurred at sub reaches t2 4 t4 1 t4 2 t6 2 and t6 3 sub reaches t3 1 t3 2 t7 1 and t7 2 were excluded from the analysis because the vaia deposits were not observable dfws were detected in most of the steep tributaries but dfd occurred in the fagher stream bordina torrent and dell acqua stream no sub reach was classified by brenna et al 2020 as dominated by hyperconcentrated flow 4 2 2 ordinary flows the field evidence collected from deposits accumulated before the vaia storm forming the local stratigraphic record is reported in table s3 and the detailed field survey worksheets supporting information dfw deposits made up most of the stratigraphic record at sub reach t1 1 of the tegnas main stem at sub reaches t2 3 t2 4 t4 2 t4 4 and t4 5 pre vaia sediments were deposited primarily by wf most of the pre vaia deposits of the fagher fa1 1 civetta ci1 1 mez me1 1 and san lucano sl1 1 tributaries were mobilized by dfw the post vaia deposits fig 5 b are up to 0 6 m thick and are characterized by evidence diagnostic of wf with bedload transport see table s4 and the detailed field survey worksheets supporting information direct observations made during the august 2020 event confirmed the occurrence of wf at some locations along the tegnas main stem i e sub reaches t2 2 t2 4 t4 2 t4 3 t4 6 and t7 2 fig 5b with bed material partially entrained larger clasts were not mobilized and transported at low or moderate rates i e stage 2 of bedload sensu carling 1988 a video shot at reach t2 2 in proximity to the flood peak showing the flowing water and the transport conditions is included in the supporting information movie s1 section 4 2 3 comparison of vaia induced high magnitude flows and ordinary flows the combined surveys of pre and post vaia deposits allowed us to assemble a complete picture of the ordinary flow types occurring at the sub reach scale along the tegnas torrent main stem 20 sub reaches and four of its tributaries fig 5 the comparison of ordinary flows and high magnitude flows that occurred during the vaia storm fig 4 revealed that during the high magnitude flood the transport processes triggered along the stream network changed at nine sub reaches fig 6 table s5 along the tegnas main stem the most important flow type changes occurred at reach t1 where four sub reaches ordinarily affected by wf experienced dfd and dfw during the vaia storm in addition flows in sub reaches t2 4 t4 1 t4 2 and t6 3 were characterized by a change from ordinary wf to dfd among the tributaries no relevant changes occurred and only the fagher torrent that is ordinary affected by dfw experienced dfd during the vaia event 4 3 high magnitude sediment water flows predicted by morphometric analysis table s6 summarizes the morphometric parameters and melton s number of each sub reach the flow types expected to occur in response to high magnitude events were determined by applying at the sub reach scale the three morphometric approaches described in section 3 2 fig 3 as classified using the approach of marchi et al 1993 the flow expected in the sub reaches between t1 1 and t1 4 of the tegnas main stem was dfw that predicted in sub reaches t1 5 and t1 6 was mixed flow and that expected in all the downstream sub reaches was wf excluding sub reach t6 1 where the flow was categorized as mixed flow because of its high slope fig 7 a all the flows occurring in the steep tributaries were classified as dfws excluding those taking place in the bordina torrent which forming in its terminal portion a large fan with a moderate slope was classified as affected by mixed flow fig 7a flows predicted using the approach of bertrand et al 2013 fig 7b were equivalent to those determined via the approach of marchi et al 1993 but mixed flows were included in the dfw class the approach of wilford et al 2004 generated different results fig 7c all the sub reaches of the tegnas main stem including the sub reaches between t2 2 and t7 2 which had melton s numbers slightly higher than 0 3 i e the threshold between wfs and dfds were classified as affected by dfd the flows occurring in most of the tributaries were classified as dfw but those taking place in the bordina scandole and besaosega channels were placed in the dfd class 4 4 comparison of vaia flows and those predicted by morphometric analysis the vaia storm flows fig 4 differ from high magnitude flows predicted using the methods of marchi et al 1993 fig 7a bertrand et al 2013 fig 7b and wilford et al 2004 fig 7c at 11 8 and 19 sub reaches out of the 33 sub reaches considered in this work respectively fig 8 table s7 the melton s numbers and slope thresholds proposed by marchi et al 1993 were satisfactorily effective measures for classifying two end member processes with a 75 accordance between actually occurring and predicted high magnitude processes for wf nine out of 12 sub reaches and a 100 accordance for dfw nine out of nine sub reaches fig 8a contrariwise only two out of 10 sub reaches were classified in the field as affected by dfd falling under the mixed class fig 8a most of the discrepancies arose along the tegnas main stem where at five sub reaches i e t2 4 t4 1 t4 2 t6 2 t6 3 wf was predicted by the morphometric approach in reality dfd occurred during vaia for two tributaries fagher and dell acqua streams the approach of marchi et al 1993 predicted dfw but it was dfd that occurred during the storm other inconsistencies arose at reach t1 of the tegnas torrent for which the thresholds proposed by marchi et al 1993 yielded dfw as a unique process in contrast to the findings of the field survey which documented a complex coexistence of different flow types i e dfw dfd and wf as responses to the vaia storm the method put forward by bertrand et al 2013 exhibited the highest predictive success rate 23 31 sub reaches but at the price of a lower resolution as it merged intermediate sediment water transport processes which in alpine streams typically consist of dfd into dfw the discrepancies are the same as those highlighted above for the approach of marchi et al 1993 fig 8b the performance of the method developed by wilford et al 2004 i e predictive success verified in 12 out of the 31 sub reaches was undermined by its failure to identify wf channel reaches in the studied stream network with the approach classifying the entire tegnas main stem as affected by dfd fig 8c note that most of the wf sub reaches classified as dfd according to wilford et al s 2004 method had melton s numbers only slightly higher than the threshold i e 0 3 table s6 that separates wf from dfd discrepancies also occurred in the classification of processes at tributaries where the dfd occurring during vaia at fagher and dell acqua streams were not predicted by the morphometric approach 4 5 channel changes and hydraulic analysis of the flood 4 5 1 changes in channel width the recognition of channel boundaries from the 2015 and 2019 orthophotos allowed us to calculate the average width of the tegnas and bordina torrents before wpre and after wpost the vaia storm and to evaluate channel widening at the sub reach scale in consideration of the width ratio i e wr the ratio between wpost and wpre table 2 the smallest widening occurred at reach t1 with a wr ranging from 1 4 to 2 2 and where the tegnas channel was already of a considerable width before the event i e sub reaches t2 3 t2 4 and between t4 3 and t4 6 with a wr ranging from 1 2 to 1 9 at sub reaches t2 3 and t2 4 considerable water fluxes flowed onto the floodplain re entering the channel at sub reach t2 4 the largest widening occurred at partially confined reaches t6 and t7 with a wr up to 5 7 and at sub reaches t2 1 t2 2 t4 1 and t4 2 with a wr up to 4 1 located in unconfined reaches t2 and t4 which had a narrow channel before the flood at these sub reaches channel widening affected large portions of the floodplain and locally the slopes of the valley intermediate widening occurred in sub reaches located in partially confined reaches t3 and t5 with a wr ranging from 2 1 to 2 7 where the channel widened during the event taking up the entire floodplain among the sub reaches considered in this analysis the terminal portion of the bordina torrent was affected by the most remarkable widening wr 6 1 4 5 2 unit stream power the pre and post flood unit stream power values ωpk pre and ωpk post respectively were computed eq 1 at the sub reaches dominated by wf and dfd during the vaia storm the flow density was always considered equal to 1000 kg m 3 i e clearwater density this choice could imply an underestimation of the flow density at some sub reaches but we consider it acceptable because of the low amount of fine sediment transportable in suspension recognized in the stream network and the dominance of bedload transport of coarse particles for wf and dfd processes the results are summarized in table 2 because of channel widening the ωpk pre values were always higher than the ωpk post values the highest ωpk values were obtained at narrow sub reaches i e t3 1 t3 2 and t4 1 with ωpk pre up to 13 300 w m 2 ωpk post up to 6100 w m 2 and at reaches t5 and t6 with ωpk pre up to 12 200 w m 2 ωpk post up to 3900 w m 2 which are characterized by a high streambed slope 5 discussion 5 1 high magnitude flow types and relationships with stream power and channel response along the main stem of the tegnas torrent sediment mobilization occurs ordinarily as wf with more or less intense bedload transport with dfw typically occurring in steep tributaries fig 5 according to the paroxysmal nature of dfd hungr 2005 church and jakob 2020 no sub reach is characterized by the ordinary occurrence of such a flow during the vaia storm recurrence interval of about 200 years the processes that affected the stream network i e wf and dfw but also dfd fig 4 considerably changed in comparison to ordinary processes at several channel sites fig 6 no sub reach was dominated by hyperconcentrated flow according with the lack of a substrate prone to produce fine grained deposits e g crosta and frattini 2004 rickenmann and koschni 2010 along the tegnas torrent three sub reaches limited to reach t1 were affected by dfw during the vaia storm fig 4 in these sub reaches sediment gravity flows originated from the steep slopes of the catchment head and in steep tributaries flowing directly into the main stem or was caused by the material injected into the channel from landslides originating from the flanks of the angheraz valley brenna et al 2020 to comprehensively analyze the processes triggered during the vaia storm an appropriate strategy is to consider the different types of dfd occurring during the storm because these phenomena as recently stated by church and jakob 2020 can be generated by various processes a dfd can be 1 meteorologically generated if triggered by the exceedance of a critical stress acting on a streambed given a severe hydrological event type 1 2 generated by the progressive dilution of a dfw by sedimentation or the injection of water type 2 and 3 triggered by the collapse of artificial or natural dams type 3 following the typology proposed by church and jakob 2020 at four sub reaches of the tegnas main stem i e t1 2 t1 6 t4 1 and t4 2 the processes were classified as type 2 dfd because their deposits were located immediately downstream from channel portions affected by dfw during the event such dfds are part of longitudinal triplets of flow transition consisting of a downstream evolution from dfw to dfd and finally to wf as occurring for instance at sub reaches t1 1 dfw dominated t1 2 dfd dominated and t1 3 wf dominated at the remaining sub reaches i e t2 4 t6 2 and t6 3 dfds were classified as type 1 dfds given that they arose at channel sites where neither dfw nor dam collapses occurred immediately upstream dfd also occurred at fagher bordina and dell acqua tributaries for which the ordinary flow responsible for sediment mobilization was determined only at fa1 1 i e dfw allowing us to identify the occurrence of an anomalous dfd during the event the fluid gravity flows induced by the vaia storm i e wf and dfd dfw were excluded because stream power is an ineffective metric for describing a sediment gravity flow were analyzed taking into account unit stream power table 2 specifically we considered pre flood unit stream power ωpk pre because it was acknowledged to be closer to the actual stream power that occurred at the flood peak surian et al 2016 the ωpk pre calculated at sub reaches where wf occurred ranged from 1000 to 5500 w m 2 fig 9 with two outliers sub reaches t5 2 and t6 1 characterized by considerably higher ωpk pre the ωpk pre values determined for the sub reaches affected by type 2 dfd were in the same range whereas the ωpk pre values of the sub reaches affected by type 1 dfd were significantly higher extending from 5000 to 10 000 w m 2 fig 9 with an exception represented by sub reach t2 4 i e a ωpk pre of about 1150 w m 2 previous works highlighted the possible occurrence of abnormally intense transport phenomena that can affect a stream during a severe hydrological event baker 1977 rickenmann and koschni 2010 borga et al 2014 bodoque et al 2015 rinaldi et al 2016 jakob et al 2017 accordingly the high magnitude flood that hit the tegnas torrent in october 2018 produced processes fig 4 remarkably different from those occurring under ordinary hydrological conditions fig 5 nevertheless the upheaval of the transport processes did not occur throughout the stream network fig 6 at 12 sub reaches the flows triggered during the vaia storm remained in the field of wf at such sub reaches which are characterized by a low slope and or an already wide channel before the event as for instance in most of reaches t2 and t4 the ωpk pre was usually lower than 5500 w m 2 with flow energy unable to fully mobilize streambed material the widening was low or moderate at these sub reaches fig 10 a and b water flow energy was able to induce localized dfd type 1 at sub reaches scattered along the stream network where the ωpk pre was higher than about 5000 to 5500 w m 2 along the tegnas torrent such increment in unit stream power occurred at sites characterized by high slopes and or at the narrowest sections of the stream e g sub reaches t6 2 t6 3 in correspondence of steep and narrow channel portions we also observed the greatest channel widenings after the event table 2 with a wr of 5 7 at sub reach t6 2 fig 10c and d and a wr of 6 1 at bo1 1 fig 10e and f other sub reaches were affected by type 2 dfd related to the upstream occurrence of a dfw at such channel locations the water flow energy i e a ωpk pre of 3000 4000 w m 2 would not have been able to fully mobilize an entire streambed which was exposed to live bed conditions severe stage 3 of bedload sensu carling 1988 thanks to the kinetic energy and mobile sediment transfer provided by a dfw cf church and jakob 2020 three exceptions emerged from the aforementioned analysis fig 9 two exceptions occur at sub reaches t5 2 and t6 1 where although estimated ωpk pre was much higher than the threshold of 5000 to 5500 w m 2 identified as significant for inducing type 1 dfd at the tegnas torrent fig 9 surveyed deposits point out to occurrence of wf by definition the shift from wf to dfd requires that in the absence of sediment input from upstream as in the case of debris flow dilution grains of almost all sizes of a streambed become fully mobile hungr et al 2014 church and jakob 2020 the mobility of gravel and cobbles can be limited by the presence of boulders if the finer fractions are hidden by coarse particles lenzi et al 2006b comiti and mao 2012 church 2013 mackenzie et al 2018 accordingly at sub reaches t5 2 and t6 1 the localized presence of mega boulders with a diameter up to 3 5 m coming from glacial deposits locally cut by the channel see the geological map available in the supporting information section of brenna et al s 2020 work that were not mobilized during the event the maximum grain size of mobilized clasts being approximately 1 1 5 m table 2 may have inhibited the establishment of a dfd by limiting the overall mobility of streambed material fig 11 a we cannot exclude however that dfds occurred at sub reaches t5 2 and t6 1 but their deposits could have been later removed reworked and or washed out by water flows afterward occurred at the same sites the third exception occurred at sub reach t2 4 where type 1 dfd occurred with a relatively low ωpk pre 1150 w m 2 at sub reach t2 3 considerable water fluxes flowed onto the floodplain it is reasonable to hypothesize that the water flowing onto the floodplain entrained large amounts of fine material i e mud sand and organic debris as suggested by the erosion evidence i e gullies observed on the overbank area adjacent to the channel fig 11b the fine material was injected into the flow at sub reach t2 4 where the overflowing water re entered the channel fig 11b the entrainment of fine material transported in suspension may have locally induced a significant increment in the density of the water flowing at sub reach t2 4 a fluid highly charged with suspended sediment with a bulk density considerably higher than 1000 kg m 3 e g 1500 1600 kg m 3 or higher as reported by middleton and hampton 1973 and shanmugam 1996 can more easily mobilize streambed particles by inducing higher stress on the bed than would normally be accomplished by a clearwater flow therefore the ωpk pre calculated at sub reach t2 4 with consideration for clearwater density could not be an effective metric for describing a peculiar case of high density flow highly charged with suspended sediment possibly a plastic hyperconcentrated flow locally promoting the triggering of a dfd church and jackob 2020 highlighted that a flood might be locally both a dfd and hyperconcentrated flow and invoked a similar phenomenon i e an abrupt increase in fluid bulk density as one of the mobilization mechanisms responsible for dfd generation channel widening occurred along the entire stream network during the vaia storm table 2 and fig 10 the ωpk pre was positively correlated with wr fig 12 in accordance with the findings of previous works e g surian et al 2016 righini et al 2017 scorpio et al 2018 that identified ωpk pre as the most significant hydraulic parameter for explaining channel widening as regards wr with high ωpk pre values we observed that the sub reaches affected by dfd t4 1 t6 2 t6 3 bo1 1 experienced a much larger widening in respect of the sub reaches where wf occurred at the same unit stream power t5 1 t5 2 t6 1 fig 12 such extraordinary widenings characterizing dfd affected channel sites accord with the extensive bank erosion reported by church and jakob 2020 as a signal of dfd occurrence related to the live bed condition moreover we speculated that bank erosion provided fresh debris that could be more easily mobilized in sediment water flow and in the case of banks containing a significant percentage of cohesive material as with glacial tills injections of fine sediment transportable as suspended load which increased the density of a flowing fluid the unit stream power and consequently its transport competence such processes could cause a positive feedback loop on the conditions promoting a dfd at a channel site as possibly occurring at sub reaches t6 2 and t6 3 where the flow density and the unit stream power may have been slightly higher than those calculated with consideration for clearwater density table 2 under these premises the presence of erodible banks and therefore a floodplain adjacent to a channel could represent a condition that facilitates the occurrence of dfd under adequate hydrological conditions future studies focusing on channel responses to extreme floods should consider in addition to hydraulic e g ωpk and morphological e g pre event channel width and lateral confinement constraints the different sediment water flows as possible controlling factors for channel modifications e g widening 5 2 performance of the morphometric approaches in predicting the high magnitude flows some discrepancies were found between the vaia sediment water flows determined on the basis of the surveyed deposits brenna et al 2020 and the high magnitude transport phenomena predicted at the sub reach scale using a semi distributed application of the morphometric approaches fig 8 ninety three comparisons were carried out between the processes predicted by the three morphometric approaches and the flows that occurred during the vaia storm i e 31 sub reaches multiplied by three morphometric approaches for 18 out of the 36 cases where wf should have been expected the three morphometric methods correctly predicted the occurrence of wf success rate of 50 the same predictive success rate was obtained for the sub reaches dominated by dfd in 22 out of the 27 cases where dfw should have been expected the approaches correctly indicated that this flow type would take place success rate of 81 the morphometric methods satisfactorily classify the sub reaches of a mountain stream dominated by sediment gravity flows in response to a high magnitude hydrological event by contrast they often in 50 of cases fail to identify sites where intermediate processes i e dfd in the case study network may occur it deserves to be stressed that whereas the morphometric approaches have the advantage of limited data requirements and easy application in the first order discrimination of expectable high magnitude flow processes they are affected by some simplifications which limit their local classification effectiveness especially for mountain catchments with complex morphometry and geological settings first these methods do not take into account the connectivity of sediment sources and the characteristics of streambed sediments thus disregarding sediment availability and channel material mobility at the channel reach scale such a shortcoming influences the effectiveness of these methods in classifying the sites dominated by dfd because the occurrence of such intermediate transport phenomena is determined by a broad spectrum of geomorphological features along with the localized availability of sediment than can be entrained by the flow an example found in our work is the occurrence of type 2 dfd induced by the injection of dfw from tributaries into the tegnas torrent fig 4 as occurring at sub reaches t4 1 and t4 2 for these sites marchi et al 1993 and bertrand et al 2013 predicted the occurrence of wf fig 7 although this limitation is not especially harmful for the recognition of the long term flow response at the catchment scale which was the original aim of these methods it may be detrimental to the assessment of the local flow response of a specific event furthermore morphometric approaches disregard hydrological conditions and the peculiar relationships that can occur between water discharge and sediment availability during a high magnitude flood a peculiar case of discordance between morphometric prediction and the flow that effectively occurred during the vaia storm is represented by the fagher torrent fa1 1 where dfw was the ordinary process determined from field analysis fig 5a as well as from the three morphometric approaches fig 7 but the flow that occurred during the vaia storm was classified as dfd fig 4 at this sub reach an anomalous downgrading from ordinary and expected dfw to dfd occurred during the high magnitude event the fagher torrent because of its geological and morphometric characteristics likely experienced a sediment supply limited condition recking 2012 church 2013 theule et al 2015 during the vaia storm in relation to the high flow transport capacity generated by the exceptional water discharge table s2 the occurrence of a dfw was inhibited by the dilution of entrained particles in a large amount of flowing water this example shows that during a high magnitude event the shift from one type of flow to another does not necessarily occur as an upgrade of transport phenomena intended as an increment in solid concentration in sediment water flow in fact downgrades e g from dfw to dfd in particular circumstances e g sediment supply limited conditions are also possible finally the representations of catchment morphometry adopted in most of the morphometric approaches are very simplified taking into account basin relief and area fan or channel slope e g marchi et al 1993 bertrand et al 2013 or basin length e g wilford et al 2004 as already noted by jackson et al 1987 low slope reaches in stepped longitudinal channel profiles may prevent debris flows from reaching a catchment outlet the presence of such low slope channel reaches is undetectable by a lumped ruggedness index such as melton s number the tegnas torrent is characterized by a longitudinal profile fig 4 with some sectors having a relatively low gradient e g most of the reaches t2 and t4 the melton s number computed with consideration for the total elevation range in the drainage catchment i e from 2870 m a s l to 600 800 m a s l of the valley floor as already noted by marchi et al 1993 does not consider the role of such low gradient channel reaches leading to an overestimation of the longitudinal sediment transfer and processes involving considerable coarse material transport moreover the thresholds of morphometric parameters adopted for classification purposes are empirical and developed for a specific geographical region for instance the melton s number threshold of 0 3 identified by wilford et al 2004 for the canadian rocky mountains to distinguish wf from dfd does not fit with the field based flow recognition at the tegnas torrent this issue less strongly affects the morphometric thresholds of marchi et al 1993 which was developed with the eastern italian alps in mind and bertrand et al 2013 which was based on a large dataset that included several alpine regions this confirms the importance of adapting morphometric thresholds for different regional conditions 6 conclusion and implications for flood hazard assessment our work focused on the comparison of high magnitude sediment water flows caused by a severe flood on a mountain catchment with ordinary flows we observed that high magnitude hydrological events induce a broad spectrum of sediment water flows i e wf dfd and dfw that can remarkably differ from those activated during ordinary floods research question 1 the most important flow type change during high magnitude events is the shift from ordinary wf to dfd nevertheless the upheaval of ordinary flow types during a high magnitude flood requires some conditions that do not necessarily occur in the entire stream network research question 2 we inferred the existence of relationships among the sediment water flow types triggered during the high magnitude event hydraulic forcing geomorphological processes some boundary conditions as the morphological setting and the sediment availability and mobility of a channel site dfd seems to occur in response to hydrological forcing that generates ωpk pre that exceeds about 5500 w m 2 fig 9 or downstream of dfw channels delivering large amounts of sediment to a receiving stream table s8 in a mountain stream such as the tegnas torrent the occurrence of such conditions is promoted at channel sites characterized by high slopes and or the narrowest sections of the stream and downstream of steep tributaries prone to dfw occurrence and well connected to a receiving stream dfd seems to cause a higher channel widening than that generated by wf fig 12 and are characterized by peculiar hazard characteristics and interaction with infrastructures wilford et al 2004 borga et al 2014 church and jakob 2020 for these reasons a crucial requirement is to improve our capability on predicting at the local scale the channel sites of a mountain stream prone to dfd occurrence in response to a severe hydrological event the adoption of three morphometric approaches employed in a semi distributed manner to predict the high magnitude flow types characterizing the stream network at the sub reach scale allowed us to conclude that such methods exhibit good performance with respect to sites affected by dfw these approaches displayed diminished effectiveness in predicting the flow type on sites affected by dfd research question 3 topography based methods developed for specific geographical settings adequately enable the first order discrimination of expectable processes for planning purposes the complex relationships found between flow types and hydraulic morphological and geological controlling factors revealed that a more detailed characterization of a stream network at the sub reach scale is necessary to understand the high magnitude transport mechanisms that can affect specific channel sites during severe to extreme

4192,a shallow water table might enhance preferential solute movement by modifying both the water flow and solute dynamics in this study we estimated soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters through a tracer experiment in lysimeters comparing different water table levels in a set up of 12 lysimeters the bottom boundary condition was set as a water table depth of 120 cm or 60 cm or as free drainage a tracer solution of bromide 250 mg l 1 40 mm was added to each lysimeter and soil water was sampled with suction cups at different depths for the following 174 days soil water content and matric potential were monitored using tdr probes and electronic tensiometers at the same depths soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters in different soil layers were estimated by inverse modeling using hydrus 1d soil hydraulic parameters were estimated from the mualem van genuchten equations while both the advection dispersion ade and physical non equilibrium mobile immobile water mim models were used to describe the solute transport moreover the soil pore network was analyzed by means of 3d x ray microtomography results showed different solute dynamics between contrasting water table managements with free drainage solute in the immobile domain was negligible and its transport was fully associated with the mobile water flow in contrast a shallow water table affected the tracer transport by modifying a the soil pore network with an increase of the macropores and a reduction of the pore connectivity b the flow field with an increase of immobile water and a reduction of αmim indicating slow exchange between mobile and immobile regions in turn promoting preferential pathways hence groundwater pollution might be worsened by preferential solute transport of agrochemicals occurring with shallow water table conditions keywords hydrus 1d preferential flow tracer test model inversion dispersivity mim x ray microtomography 1 introduction nonpoint source pollution of groundwater caused by fertilizers and agrochemicals is a major issue worldwide chae et al 2004 wu and sun 2016 although the genesis of diffuse agriculture pollution has been investigated for decades understanding solute dynamics in the vadose zone is still challenging soil hydraulic properties show a nonlinear behavior under variably saturated conditions that can vary greatly due to spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the soil pore system kabat et al 1997 vogel et al 2000 further soil hydraulic properties estimated from the laboratory may differ from those in the field due to different soil air displacement conditions basile et al 2003 soil structure can be affected by shrinkage or swelling processes due to drying and wetting cycles or tillage operations that might increase the formation of macropores herbrich and gerke 2017 jirků et al 2013 and in turn enhance the occurrence of preferential flow pathways jarvis et al 2016 kumahor et al 2015 further uncertainty in understanding pollutant transport is related to the groundwater table condition some studies emphasized that evapotranspiration and upward fluxes increased under shallower water table conditions thus minimizing drainage and the risk of groundwater contamination groh et al 2016 in contrast other authors reported that a shorter residence time can be observed in the unsaturated zone when the travel distance between soil surface and groundwater was reduced by particular meteorological and lower boundary conditions e g the occurrence of shallow water table haria et al 2003 sprenger et al 2016 wossenyeleh et al 2020 besides the type of land use this condition would lead to a higher probability of the contaminant reaching the groundwater rahman 2008 and a lower degree of pollutant soil matrix reaction maher 2010 the water table depth might affect the magnitude of solute movement by changing the water content inside the soil system likely leading to preferential flow for instance guo and lin 2018 and haria et al 2003 found that preferential solute movement occurred under shallow water table conditions increasing the risk of solute bypass hendrickx and flury 2001 beven and germann 1982 it was hypothesized that above the capillary fringe the water stored in the soil matrix could be moved to preferential flow pathways when a low amount of rainfall is added to the system krzeminska et al 2014 in such conditions vegetation could enhance the susceptibility to groundwater contamination the roots that grow until the water pool could increase the soil macroporosity by connecting the soil surface and the saturated zone mitchell et al 1995 furthermore preferential flows naturally occur in presence of drying cracks fissures and biopores e g caused by earthworms gerke 2006 when dry soil conditions can favor hydrophobicity deurer and bachmann 2007 or in soils affected by swelling and shrinking processes depending on soil water content changes beven and germann 1982 the geometry and connectivity of water flow might change in porous media where the spatial arrangement between void and solid phases depends on drying wetting cycles sayem and kong 2016 vervoort et al 1999 this can be originated by shallow water table fluctuations that can affect both soil hydraulic and physical properties especially within weakly structured soils pagliai et al 1989 or loamy soils with a high organic matter content gérard et al 2004 modeling methodologies to predict diffuse nutrient and agrochemical pollution are fundamental to identify management zones e g nitrate vulnerable zones and assess alternatives of agroecosystem management solute movement in both saturated and unsaturated porous media is usually simulated with the advection dispersion equation ade application of the ade under equilibrium conditions requires knowledge of dispersive transport parameters such as the dispersivity that are cumbersome to measure directly they can be estimated by inverse modeling fitting ade to field transport data jury and roth 1990 however difficulties in establishing geochemical conditions goldberg et al 2010 and incorrect assumptions about water and solute dynamics and boundary conditions durner et al 2007 can lead to unrealistic estimation of transport parameters such as in the case of non equilibrium flow moreover inverse modelling can be affected by different optimization strategies that e g consider simultaneously or sequentially different type of observation data matric potential solute concentration etc in the objective function groh et al 2018 observations conducted at the lysimeter scale can help to assess the solute behavior when they are combined with numerical simulations klier et al 2008 thuyet et al 2010 in some circumstances lysimeters could lead to a bias due to field boundaries that are difficult to reproduce e g providing a lower boundary exposure to atmospheric pressure flury et al 1999 isch et al 2019 or the disruption of water flow and the hydraulic gradient due to the bottom of the lysimeter itself recently new technologies have been developed to overcome bottom boundary related problem pütz et al 2016 in a high precision lysimeter network adjusted the matric potential at the bottom of the soil profile to the potential measured from the surrounding soil enabling the upward or downward water flux across the bottom of the lysimeter a similar process is described in von unold and fank 2008 however even in their traditional set up they are still key tools to represent real world conditions in a controlled manner better than laboratory columns here an experiment was set up by using twelve lysimeters under two different water table depth conditions and free drainage lysimeters were equipped with probes for continuous monitoring of soil water content and matric potential at different depths and with automated suction cups for soil water sampling we estimated soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters through a bromide tracer experiment and inverse modeling applying both the ade and mobile immobile mim models in a multi layer soil profile our hypothesis was that a shallow water table could affect the solute movement by modifying soil properties and generating preferential solute pathways 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the experimental site this study was conducted at the experimental farm l toniolo of the university of padova in legnaro 45 21 n 11 57 e 8 m a s l northeastern italy the study site was originally set up in 1984 consisting of twenty 1 m 1 m 1 5 m length width depth drainable lysimeters the bottom of each lysimeter is funnel shaped and connected via an underground drain pipe 1 slope to an external tube equipped with a valve that regulates both the water table level and leaching discharge fig 1 a each lysimeter was filled in 1984 with soil excavated from the adjacent experimental farm in a way that preserved the original soil horizons to facilitate water drainage and prevent soil washout a 15 cm thick layer of gravel 30 50 mm diameter covers the bottom of each lysimeter the soil is fluvi calcaric cambisol fao unesco 2008 table 1 which represents about 50 of the low lying venetian plain soil particle size distribution sand silt and clay content was determined by using a particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern panalytical ltd spectris company ph and ec were measured by an electrode in soil suspensions with a soil to water ratio of 1 2 5 and 1 2 w v respectively total nitrogen was analyzed with the kjeldahl method soil organic carbon content was determined with a cns analyzer vario macro cube elementar analysensysteme gmbh total and active carbonates with the dietrich fruehling calcimeter and ammonium oxalate titration method respectively available phosphorus with the olsen method and exchangeable potassium by the extraction with ammonium acetate an automated mobile roof fig 1c was built over the whole area allowing control of rain events and water fluxes on lysimeters and preserving the site from destructive weather events fig 1d a weather station decagon devices inc pullman wa consisting of an anemometer wind direction temperature relative humidity probe pyranometer and pluviometer was installed near the experimental site to monitor site specific conditions data were collected using a datalogger em50 data collection system decagon devices inc pullman wa 2 2 automated monitoring and pore water sampling systems an automated monitoring system was installed in 2011 in twelve out of twenty lysimeters with sensors at depths of 15 30 and 60 cm the system consisted of cs635 tdr time domain reflectrometry probes campbell scientific inc lincoln nebraska usa to estimate the volumetric water content t4e electronic tensiometers ums gmbh munich de to measure the soil matric potential and spe20 polyethylene nylon suction cups meter group munich de to collect the mobile water the tdr calibrated in the laboratory had an accuracy of 1 5 to ensure continuity between soils and probes tensiometers and suction cups were installed in horizontal cavities forcing the excess soil slurry previously used to fill the cavities to discharge tdr and tensiometer probes were connected to a cr 10x datalogger campbell scientific inc lincoln nebraska usa through a series of multiplexers the automatized system continuously kept suction equilibrium with the surrounding soil water tension morari 2006 by integrating soil matric potential measurements acquired by the electronic tensiometers with pore water samplers fig 1b e since vacuum applied to the sampling media was constantly regulated during the sampling period the sample solute concentration was more accurate compared with other soil water samplers farsad et al 2012 to regulate continuously the vacuum in pore water samplers based on matric potential a system composed of a 5 volt digital analog conversion module a04a campbell scientific inc lincoln nebraska usa connected to an electronic vacuum regulator incorporating a pressure relief valve itv2091 smc corporation tokyo japan was employed in this way only the solutes that were involved in the mobile flow were sampled by the pore water samplers the imposed negative pressure applied to soil water samplers was in the range of 2 to 70 kpa and was maintained close to the soil water tension readings to overcome pore water sampler resistance and the force with which water was held by soil the imposed negative pressure was set at 2 kpa less than the soil water matric potential readings in the surrounding soil masarik et al 2004 the system overcame frequent vacuum fluctuations of traditional systems that control the suction application duration or that are subjected to vacuum pressure leakage in vacuum tanks farsad et al 2012 in drier soil conditions the automated suction control system was not activated because of the extremely low soil hydraulic conductivity making water sampling inoperative 2 3 experimental design and tracer test since 2011 the experimental site was used to test several combinations of crop and fertilization management with different water table conditions longo et al 2021 in the present study twelve lysimeters were used to evaluate the effect of groundwater management on solute movement under bare soil conditions the bottom boundary condition was set with a water table level at 120 cm wt120 60 cm wt60 and as free drainage fd four replicates hereafter labeled a b c d were used to better govern the soil variability and evaluate differences between treatments the valve at the bottom of each lysimeter was used to regulate manually every day the water table level to the expected values 120 cm or 60 cm despite that groundwater level fluctuations could occur within a maximum of 10 cm in order to investigate solute transport a saline tracer solution of kbr containing a br concentration of 250 mg l 1 was added to every lysimeter at the beginning of the soil water monitoring on november 5th 2013 10 g of br in total with a simulated rain event of 40 mm prior to the tracer test background br concentration of the soil solution was assessed at different depths and in the leaching water concentrations were below the detection limits 0 05 mg l 1 the water sampling started on november 6th 2013 was carried out on a daily time scale in the first week and subsequently at increasing intervals until the end of the experiment april 27th 2014 when the pore water was lastly sampled to evaluate any residual br concentration once collected the water samples were stored at 20 c and then analyzed with ion chromatography dionex ics 900 provided with a conductivity detector model ds 5 and a column ion pac cs12a thermo scientific to measure bromide concentration during the experiment the soil was maintained bare such that total atmospheric water loss was due to evaporation the water input was due only to irrigation referred as simulated rainfall events fig 2 2 4 advection dispersion and mobile immobile water solute transport equations in soil the advection dispersion equation ade is widely used to describe solute transport for fickian flow when all the water molecules are taking part in the flow the ade for transient flow in soil is presented in equation 1 when no adsorption occurs 1 θ c t z θ d c z j w c z where c is the solute concentration mg cm 3 θ is the soil water content cm3 cm 3 d is the dispersion coefficient cm2 d 1 that takes into account both hydrodynamic dispersion and molecular diffusion šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 j w is the flux term for water cm d 1 t is time d and z is the space coordinate cm the dispersion coefficient d accounting for both molecular diffusion and hydrodynamic dispersion is equal to 2 d ξ θ d l w v λ where ξ θ is the dimensionless tortuosity factor d l w is the molecular diffusion coefficient in free water cm2 d 1 v is the averaged pore water velocity cm d 1 and λ is the longitudinal dispersivity cm a parameter that expresses the mixing length of the solute in the soil the ade equation is widely used to simulate solute transport but it cannot sufficiently describe transport in heterogeneous and unsaturated porous media gao et al 2010 when physical non equilibrium occurs the mobile immobile mim equation van genuchten and wierenga 1976 is applied as a modified version of the ade assuming that the water inside micropores mainly intra aggregate pores is stagnant and the solute can be trapped in it hence the water flow and so the solute movement is restricted only to the macropores mainly interaggregate pores and fractures šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 in the mim model the water content θ is divided into two fractions the mobile phase θmo which plays a key role in solute leaching and the immobile phase θim 3 θ θ m o θ i m the mim model uses two equations one for the mobile domain eq 4 and the other for the immobile domain eq 5 without the sorption terms as reported by šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 4 θ m o c m o t z θ m o d m o c m o z q m o c m o z γ s 5 θ i m c i m t γ s where c m o and c i m are

is the rate of mass transfer between the two domains mg cm 3 d 1 that includes the first order mass transfer coefficient αmim d 1 and is equal to 6 γ s α m i m c m o c i m the dispersion coefficient de for the mim model is described as the following eq 7 reported from radcliffe and šimůnek 2010 7 d e d m o θ m o θ where the term on the right side of the equation represents the contribution of dispersion dmo in the mobile phase 2 5 estimation of soil hydraulic and solute transport properties using hydrus 1d hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2009 was used to numerically solve the richards equation for variably saturated water flow under equilibrium flow conditions by using the mualem van genuchten equation to describe soil hydraulic properties solute transport under equilibrium and physical non equilibrium state was simulated with ade and mim equations respectively first the water flow was modeled applying the inverse solution approach the difference between observed and simulated volumetric soil water content and matric potential at depths of 15 30 and 60 cm was minimized in the objective function which was defined as eq 8 8 φ b y j i m v j i 1 n j w i j y j z t i y j z t i b 2 where φ is the target function m is the number of variables measured nj is the numbered measurements for the variable j v and w are weighting factors for individual measurements associated with the variable j and with each individual value i of j y j is the variable observed at time t and space z y j is the corresponding model predicted value at the same t and z while b is the vector of parameters to be optimized soil hydraulic θs αvg n ks and solute transport parameters λade λmim αmim and θim the depth of the soil profile was set at 130 cm and was vertically discretized in 101 nodes 1 3 cm regular mesh size for the soil hydraulic parameters estimation the maximum number of iterations was set at 100 with a number of observed soil water contents and matric potentials at daily time scale that ranged between 880 and 1005 in total matric potential data that were out of range 800 to 1000 cm and outliers were not used for the inverse modelling soil hydraulic parameters of the mualem van genuchten function θs αvg n and ks were estimated for the 0 20 20 45 and 45 130 cm layers for the 174 days of the trial november 4th 2013 to april 27th 2014 the residual soil water content θr was set 0 01 cm3 cm 3 according to previous analysis on the same soil morari 2006 and the conductivity tortuosity l was 0 5 mualem 1976 fixed values were used a to reduce the number of unknown parameters b because preliminary analysis including θr and l as variables did not improve the accuracy of the results c due to their low sensitivity under the specific soil experimental conditions e g mostly in the wet range wösten and van genuchten 1988 potential evapotranspiration rates and rainfall events were set as upper boundary conditions while a seepage face in free drainage fd and variable pressure heads describing daily fluctuations of water table levels in wt60 and wt120 were set as bottom boundary conditions potential evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the hargreaves equation multiplied by the crop coefficient for bare soil kc 1 15 allen et al 2005 hereafter referred as potential evaporation as reported in fig 2 initial conditions were set in soil water content by using soil moisture data recorded by tdrs at the beginning of the experiment at the three corresponding observation points 15 30 and 60 cm depth then the variability of soil water content along depth was estimated by a linear scaling procedure based on vogel et al 1991 after soil hydraulic properties solute transport parameters at different depths were estimated the objective function was defined in terms of bromide concentration data i e y j in eq 8 as function of time and depth weighted by the standard deviation for this purpose two different equations were used a the ade to estimate dispersivity λade b the mim physical non equilibrium model to estimate dispersivity λmim mass transfer coefficient αmim and immobile soil water content θim boundary conditions for solute transport were set as concentration flux of the infiltrating water 250 mg l 1 of bromide and lower zero concentration gradient at the outflow bromide water diffusion was set at 1 6 cm2 d 1 leistra and boesten 2010 lide 2003 and the soil water adsorption coefficient kd was set as zero due to its negligible sorption ladu and zhang 2011 the maximum number of iterations was set at 10 with a number of observed bromide flux concentrations in the objective function that ranged between 25 and 100 previously estimated soil hydraulic parameters were used as soil information for the solute transport simulations to test the goodness of fit between observed and predicted values three statistical approaches were used the coefficient of determination r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and the root mean square error rmse these statistical parameters were chosen for their ability to compare comprehensively the goodness of fit of simulation models power 1993 zeng et al 2014 in general the best fit was represented by rmse close to 0 and nse and r2 close to 1 afterward the fraction of mobile water β was calculated as the ratio between the mobile θmo θ θim see eq 3 and the total soil water content θ vervoort et al 1999 when no adsorption occurs van genuchten and wierenga 1976 since β is dependent on θ the averaged θ θavg during the 174 days experimental trial was calculated for all lysimeters and used to compute β 2 6 procedure of inverse modeling for parameter optimization the procedure of inverse modelling in a multi layer soil profile can be applied using a simultaneous groh et al 2018 or a sequential šimůnek et al 2001 approach for the estimation of soil hydraulic and solute parameters in our case the sequential approach was necessary to minimize problems of non uniqueness due to the high number of parameters to be optimized diederik et al 2002 hopmans et al 2002 a stepwise layer by layer procedure starting from the top applied to each lysimeter was performed first the soil profile was assumed homogeneous and hydraulic parameters were optimized against daily soil water contents measured by tdrs and matric potentials measured by tensiometers at the corresponding depth the initial values of hydraulic parameters were estimated based on the pedotransfer functions already implemented in hydrus 1d using particle size distribution and bulk density data after the first run the obtained hydraulic parameters were fixed in the first layer 0 20 cm and a two layer soil profile 0 20 20 130 cm was defined to optimize the parameters in the second one the procedure was performed until parameters in all three layers were optimized when all the hydraulic parameters were estimated some further tuning was done by re estimating the same parameters of different layers until no further improvement was achieved after that solute transport parameters were optimized starting from initial values of 5 cm 0 1 cm3 cm 3 and 0 5 d 1 for λ θ i m and αmim respectively parameter optimization for both hydraulic and solute transport modeling was based on the levenberg marquardt method to minimize the target function marquardt 1963 the weights associated with the observed data were manually set as 1 since data were automatically weighted by standard deviation by hydrus 1d isch et al 2019 2 7 x ray computed microtomography to identify additional pore structure properties one undisturbed soil core 7 cm diameter 5 cm height was collected after the tracer test in each tested lysimeter totally 12 using as hand auger eijkelkamp the netherlands at a depth of 25 to 30 cm and analyzed by means of x ray microtomography µct before analysis soil cores were equilibrated at 60 cm matric potential with a sandbox apparatus to ensure uniform conditions after that they were gently removed from stainless steel cylinders and reduced in size to allow higher greyscale contrast of acquired projections between soil porosity and matrix undisturbed samples ca 2 cm diameter 4 cm height were obtained from the center of the cores using a knife and then wrapped in parafilm scanning was done using a skyscan 1172 µct bruker microct belgium at 88 kv and 112 µa and projections were acquired during a 180 sample rotation at 0 27 angular incremental steps beam hardening artefacts were minimized during data acquisition with a 0 5 mm al filter projections were reconstructed using nrecon software version 1 6 9 4 bruker microct belgium to obtain a stack of at least 1500 2d images in 8 bit depth the final voxel resolution was 27 25 µm in all three directions after reducing noise with a 3 3 3 median filter the reconstructed greyscale volumes were segmented into binary images i e soil pores and matrix using a clustering based threshold method otsu 1979 soil porosity detected by µct 27 25 2834 µm was calculated by dividing the number of pore voxels by the total number of voxels of the analyzed volume the 3d mean pore diameter and pore size classes were estimated by using a sphere fitting method at intervals of two voxels that determines the local thickness of every medial axis pore voxel remy and thiel 2002 pore classes were divided into micropores 27 25 327 00 µm and macropores 327 00 µm to emphasize the contribution of the large pores to possible non equilibrium flow jarvis 2007 the euler number by calculating the number of redundant connections between pores per unit volume mm 3 was used as an estimate of local pore connectivity that becomes increasingly by negative with increasing connectivity and increasingly by positive with decreasing connectivity vogel et al 2010 digital image processing and analysis was done using ctan software version 1 17 7 2 bruker microct belgium 3 results 3 1 experimental soil water content pressure heads and meteorological data total water input as simulated rainfall during the experimental period was 638 1 mm fig 2 starting november 5th with 40 mm the highest input was observed on march 1st when 55 6 mm of simulated rain fell on the lysimeters in one day from the beginning until february 16th the potential evaporation from bare soil was always lower than 1 6 mm d 1 and after it increased to a maximum value of 5 4 mm d 1 on april 25th soil water content dynamics observed during the experimental trial november 5th 2013 april 27th 2014 showed that free drainage fd lysimeters were always drier than wt120 and wt60 fig 3 at the beginning of the experiment before any simulated rainfall event the soil water content was mainly affected by the water table management condition in fact the free drainage lysimeters average of four replicates showed soil water content of about 0 129 0 024 cm3 cm 3 at 15 cm and increased up to 0 193 0 006 cm3 cm 3 and 0 222 0 001 cm3 cm 3 respectively at 30 cm and 60 cm depth higher initial soil water content within the soil profile was observed in wt120 0 257 0 006 0 332 0 023 0 412 0 002 cm3 cm 3 and reached maxima in wt60 0 334 0 02 0 370 0 011 and 0 414 0 004 cm3 cm 3 after subsequent simulated rainfall events that amounted to 120 mm november 5th 7th 2013 soil water content in fd rapidly increased reaching 0 280 0 018 0 363 0 006 and 0 370 0 012 cm3 cm 3 at 15 30 and 60 cm respectively in particular stronger fluctuations were observed at 15 cm that were smoothed and slightly delayed in deeper layers during the experimental trial fd had on average 0 266 0 017 cm3 cm 3 0 357 0 006 cm3 cm 3 and 0 390 0 002 cm3 cm 3 at 15 30 and 60 cm respectively while the maximum and minimum values were 0 349 and 0 141 0 403 and 0 183 0 441 and 0 220 cm3 cm 3 at the same depth in general during the experiment soil water content in the surface layer was always lower than at 30 cm and 60 cm similar soil water content dynamics were observed in wt120 and wt60 at 15 cm and 30 cm showing a peak after each rainfall event in contrast at 60 cm the soil water content was slightly affected by additional water input due to higher initial soil water content conditions the soil water content gradient was reduced in wt120 and wt60 compared to fd mainly at 15 cm this was particularly noticeable in wt60 when the topsoil water content reached similar values or even higher than those in the subsoil at 30 and 60 cm due to simulated rainfall events notably similar soil water contents close to saturation about 0 43 cm3 cm 3 were found at 60 cm in both wt120 and wt60 despite being managed according to different water table levels furthermore in wt lysimeters maximum and minimum values were higher with respect to the free drainage condition showing similar maximum water contents reached along the depths minimum recorded values were lower mostly in wt60 0 160 0 336 and 0 386 cm3 cm 3 at 15 30 and 60 cm than wt120 0 248 0 291 and 0 409 cm3 cm 3 at 15 30 and 60 cm except for the intermediate depth suggesting wider fluctuations in wt60 lysimeters similar observations were reported by measured pressure head dynamics fig 4 with wider fluctuations that were found in fd lysimeters compared to smoother dynamics as observed in wt120 and especially wt60 after each simulated rainfall event the matric potential increased sharply until values always 50 cm in all lysimeters regardless the water table management notably the effect of a shallow water table was recorded by the tensiometers with values above 0 cm especially when the water table was set at 60 cm depth in some cases this was also observed in wt120 when simulated rainfalls of at least 40 mm occurred with high frequency 3 2 soil water dynamics and hydraulic parameters estimation with hydrus 1d soil water contents were well simulated by hydrus 1d fig 3 but in some cases mostly at 15 cm the model showed an excessive sensitivity to predict wide and frequent soil water content fluctuations particularly in fd lysimeters in contrast the sharp increase of volumetric water content after rainfall events at 30 and 60 cm depth and the following slower drying dynamics were well described in case of pressure heads simulation fig 4 the model showed higher fluctuations at 15 cm as reported for water contents but good predictions at the deeper depths indeed the close fitting between measured and modeled water contents was indicated by the goodness of inverse operations table s1 for all the treatments generally the best fit was found in wt120 while the lowest was in wt60d r2 0 619 rmse 0 030 nse 0 198 in general water contents in fd lysimeters were well estimated according to high r2 and nse and low rmse furthermore inverted parameters well described the soil water dynamics of all lysimeters at the three soil layers fig 3 the goodness of fit of simulated vs observed matric heads was generally lower than water contents table s1 the best fit was found for wt lysimeters r2 ranging from 0 284 to 0 786 except for wt60a which showed a negative nse 0 124 similar results were reported for fdc and fdd r2 0 430 and 0 377 nse 1 222 and 2 416 respectively mostly due to a general underestimation of the matric potential by the model estimated saturated soil water content table 2 and fig s1 was generally lower in the topsoil layer 0 392 0 015 cm3 cm 3 at 0 20 cm than in the subsoil up to 0 429 0 004 cm3 cm 3 at 45 130 cm with slight variability between treatments at the topsoil the air entry potential αvg was 0 013 0 003 cm 1 similar to the intermediate one 0 010 0 001 cm 1 while the deep layers showed halved αvg 0 006 0 002 cm 1 a tendency to lower n values was observed in the 45 130 cm layer 1 17 0 02 compared to 0 20 1 34 0 00 and 20 45 cm 1 20 0 01 which indicated a flatter pore size distribution at the greatest depth table 2 saturated hydraulic conductivity varied between treatments in general showing higher values in fd 45 70 28 76 cm d 1 on average while in wt120 and wt60 values were 14 21 6 20 cm d 1 and 19 26 3 38 cm d 1 greatest ks values were found in the deepest layer of fd 101 11 25 62 cm d 1 showing a most pronounced increase with depth than wt lysimeters 3 3 experimental bromide movement in lysimeters experimental bromide concentration dynamics at different depths mg l 1 are shown in figs 5 and s2 dots describing the 174 day monitoring from november 5th 2013 until april 27th 2014 in fd the first water sampling was delayed until november 13th because of the very dry conditions at the beginning of the experiment figs 3 and 4 almost two weeks after application of br and 160 mm of simulated rainfall the highest concentrations were detected at 15 cm reaching 75 mg l 1 in lysimeters fdb and fdc concentrations sharply decreased to values 5 mg l 1 one month after application at increasing depths concentration peaks were shifted a few days later 1 8 bromide concentrations were never higher than 40 mg l 1 at 30 cm depth and even lower at 60 cm thirty days after the br application and 360 mm of water input bromide concentrations were almost steady at values close to 1 mg l 1 or below wt treatments exhibited earlier arrival of br than fd bromide was first detected the day after application 6th of november at concentrations up to 90 mg l 1 the fast br movement was emphasized in wt120 when it showed a peak at 30 cm on november 8th 48 4 mg l 1 on average followed by a peak at 60 cm starting november 12th especially in lysimeter wt120a reaching a maximum concentration of 35 mg l 1 wt60 showed a similar trend compared to wt120 at the surface and intermediate sampling points in all wt60 lysimeters the br had a peak above 80 mg l 1 detected at 15 cm that gradually dropped to about 5 mg l 1 after one month at 30 cm the peak was reached on november 12th detected also at 15 cm due to a 40 mm irrigation and then decreased to approximately 10 mg l 1 at the end of the experiment at 60 cm br was detected immediately after the 15 and 30 cm sampling but a peak of concentration was never found these dynamics highlighted the fluctuating effect of the shallow water table which likely enhanced br dilution as well hindered its complete leaching 3 4 modeled solute transport dynamics and parameterization with hydrus 1d model performance metrics of bromide dynamic using ade and mim are reported in table 3 the fitting showed better values with mim than ade in all the treatments in general r2 and nse were higher and rmse lower using mim confirming a better model efficiency the model performance with mim also changed between lysimeters indicating that in a few cases unsatisfactory predictions occurred e g wt60b in which nse was negative modeled dynamics with mim are shown in figs 5 and s3 hydrus 1d simulated initially high peaks of bromide mostly in the fd treatment max 170 mg l 1 at 15 and 30 cm depths followed by a fast decrease black and red lines that reached concentrations close to 0 mg l 1 after 35 40 days in fd br at 60 cm depth grey line showed delayed and lower peaks 40 mg l 1 compared to 15 and 30 cm with final estimated concentrations close to 5 mg l 1 in contrast wt lysimeters mostly showed lower initial peaks of bromide than fd lysimeters that flattened after 20 days to concentrations close to 0 mg l 1 at 15 and 30 cm except for wt60a at 60 cm hydrus 1d was not always able to predict br concentration dynamics as observed in the upper layers fig 5 e g wt120c solute transport parameters from inverse modeling are shown in table s2 for the ade and table 4 for the mim model very high dispersivity values for ade λade were found at the surface layer of both wt120 211 5 38 5 cm and wt60 152 3 45 7 cm lysimeters in fd λade was much lower generally decreasing with depth as wt lysimeters large values of λ and the poor fit table 3 using ade indicated likely non equilibrium conditions radcliffe and šimůnek 2010 by applying the physical non equilibrium model the mim dispersivity λmim was reduced compared to the ade in wt treatments mobile immobile dispersivity at the surface layer 0 20 cm of wt60 was 21 7 9 2 cm on average whereas higher values were found in wt120 32 7 11 3 cm in contrast wt120 showed larger λmim than wt60 at the deepest soil layer with an average value of 16 5 9 6 cm and 14 7 2 7 cm respectively in some cases λmim in fd showed values similar to results reported using ade fda and fdd mostly results from inverse modeling showed that the degree of solute exchange between the immobile and mobile region αmim d 1 changed among treatments this suggested a diverse contribution of immobile water to solute transport either with low frequency as described by small αmim values mostly in wt treatments or high frequency as described by large αmim values mostly in the topsoil layer in fd and deepest layer in wt120 free drainage was strongly differentiated from wt even in terms of mobile water fraction in that β estimates for free drainage were generally close to 1 θim very low whereas for wt treatments they were much lower revealed by higher θim 3 5 pore network characterization by means of x ray computed microtomography soil porosity in the range 27 25 2834 00 µm decreased from 0 15 0 01 cm3 cm 3 in fd to 0 11 0 03 cm3 cm 3 in wt120 and 0 08 cm3 cm 3 in wt60 table 5 the macroporosity 327 00 µm was 35 3 9 9 of the µct detected soil porosity in fd while increased up to 40 4 3 6 in wt120 and 50 7 6 8 in wt60 to note the high pore size class variability of fd that was due to a single macropore observed in just one soil core i e fdb the euler number was always negative suggesting that pores with multiple connections dominated over single isolated pores lower euler number values were found in fd 0 92 0 33 10 2 mm 3 compared to wt120 0 45 0 19 10 2 mm 3 and wt60 0 12 0 03 10 2 mm 3 a visual inspection of the pore structure in some example images fig 6 highlighted the different network organization between treatments with an increasing number of large macropores where the water table occurred 4 discussion modeling of soil hydraulic parameters with hydrus 1d highlighted only slight differences of soil water retention parameters between groundwater management systems similar water retention and saturated conductivity data were already reported in previous studies using the same cambisol dal ferro et al 2015 morari 2006 emphasizing the accuracy of the inverse modeling as well as the ability of the water flow equilibrium model to describe soil water content dynamics nevertheless some uncertainty in hydraulic parameter estimation was observed especially in soil layers with permanent high soil water content isch et al 2019 a detailed investigation of the pore network provided by µct analysis revealed some subtle structure changes between treatments fig 6 with an increase in the macropore structure 327 µm when the water table was set at 120 and 60 cm depth table 5 consequently we cannot exclude that a fraction of water was moved by preferential flow especially at the beginning of the experiment when dry soil conditions occurred however from our experimental results the deeper layers did not respond to rainfall events earlier than the shallower graham and lin 2011 and from simulations its magnitude was not relevant to justify the use of water flow non equilibrium models this contrasts with results on solute transport where the physical mim non equilibrium model seemed the most suitable to describe br movement table 3 especially under wt treatments according to our results previous studies adopted similar estimation process of soil hydraulic properties the use of single porosity models in variably saturated porous media and solute transport parameters with both ade and mim abbasi et al 2004 diederik et al 2002 isch et al 2019 highlighting that physical non equilibrium processes can take place when the soil profile is non uniform and the structure heterogeneity can create differences either in water pressure or solute concentrations or both jarvis 2007 modeling of br movement with the ade showed limitations in describing the solute movement in the wt treatment soils because dispersivity λade especially in the unsaturated layers was often much higher than the transport distance with high standard errors tables 3 and s2 suggesting preferential solute movement vervoort et al 1999 the ade assumes a high degree of mixing among flow paths that is unlikely to occur when macropores extend a column length as suggested by contrasting results between fd and wt treatments the only exception was the saturated layer in the wt treatments 45 130 cm where λade never exceeded the transport distance this is in accordance with some authors which indicated that ade is suitable to describe solute movement under saturated conditions padilla et al 1999 in contrast the mim model was able to describe the solute exchange between mobile and immobile regions of the soil pores maraqa et al 1997 zeng et al 2014 above the shallow water table the modelling results were supported by experimental µct analyses on the pore structure despite being conducted on small cores and at a single depth the higher frequency of macropores under wt conditions compared to fd was associated with rapid non equilibrium flow jarvis 2007 the only exception was fdb whose macropores represented 60 of total investigated porosity range 27 25 2834 00 µm it follows that some effect of shallow water table fluctuations in modifying the soil pore arrangement cannot be completely excluded guo and lin 2018 for instance lysimeters were cultivated with maize under similar water table conditions before the present experiment longo et al 2021 therefore it can be hypothesized a different redistribution of crop root biomass with depth instead swelling or shrinkage processes would be limited being the soil under investigation a silt loam with low organic matter content these findings were further supported by the positive relationship that was observed between the macropore class and the depth weighted dispersivity λade value that was calculated for each lysimeter fig 7 a it is worth of note the high representativeness of macropores in fdb an outlier with respect to the other fd that was associated with very high modelled dispersivity in addition macropores frequency was negatively correlated with the euler number fig 7b the lower the value the higher the degree of pore connectivity supporting the conceptual model described by jarvis et al 2012 and also validated by larsbo et al 2014 according to which the strongest preferential transport would occur in soils that contain macropores that lack well connected networks with smaller pores dispersivity was different in the wt120 and wt60 treatments using the mim model especially in the topsoil layer here higher λmim in the wt120 treatment than the wt60 might be associated with unsaturated conditions that likely increased the tortuous path of mechanical dispersion sometimes exceeding the transport distance λmim 20 cm the behavior of β and αmim parameters indirectly supports the hypothesis of preferential solute movement under wt treatment conditions theoretically when β equals 1 and αmim is high the mim results align with ade results downplaying the role of preferential solute movement as observed in fd lysimeters therefore in the fd treatment solute in the immobile domain was negligible in turn making the transfer coefficient αmim no longer relevant comegna et al 2001 instead in the wt treatment the β parameter changed with depth due to water table fluctuations which created intermittent saturated unsaturated conditions figs 3 and 4 especially under intermediate soil water contents about 0 30 0 40 cm3 cm 3 the fraction of mobile water was broadly variable decreasing from 0 65 0 08 when the soil water content was relatively low 0 35 cm3 cm 3 in wt120 topsoil layer to 0 30 0 06 when the soil water content increased to values 0 35 cm3 cm 3 in wt120 20 130 cm layer wt60 topsoil layer on the contrary it was found that β slightly increased when close to saturation conditions were found i e below the 20 cm layer under wt60 0 55 0 12 and 0 37 0 14 at the intermediate and deep layer respectively and at the deepest layer of wt120 0 54 0 09 this might suggest that different solute dynamics occurred with varying groundwater management and soil water contents this was confirmed also by αmim estimation in the deepest layer close to saturation conditions of the wt120 treatment the average value was 42 29 12 23 d 1 while under the wt60 treatment it was widely lower 0 07 0 01 d 1 highlighting a diverse contribution of the immobile water domain on solute dynamic according to wt management according to comegna et al 2001 low values of β and αmim are indication of preferential solute transport to note that even fdb despite being characterized by a soil structure similar to wt followed the same solute transport dynamics as per the other free drainage lysimeters in turn corroborating that solute mixing and flow was due to the combined effect of structure properties jarvis et al 2012 and soil water content conditions kumahor et al 2015 affecting the connectivity of the water phase the relationship between soil water content and averaged β reported in fig 8 corroborated our previous findings notably β decreased as the soil water content increased until close to saturation conditions due to the shallow water table a similar dynamic was previously observed by toride et al 2003 in a column experiment using dune sand in unsaturated conditions vervoort et al 1999 observed a different mobile water dynamics according to different saturation levels in fact for frequently and intermittent saturated horizons i e deep and intermediate layers of wt they found that β had low to moderate values while for unsaturated horizons e g fd and topsoil layer in wt120 β resulted in higher values in accordance with that we observed that preferential solute transport increased under shallow water table conditions until non capillary macropores were empty in such conditions a significant capillary fringe can take place and additional water input would converge part of water and solutes stored in the soil matrix into preferential pathways thus making macropores more active krzeminska et al 2014 it follows that a likely hydraulic instability between the water filled network of smaller pores and the macropores occurred leading to large variation of local transport velocities beven and germann 1982 larsbo et al 2014 in contrast free drainage conditions did not follow the same dynamic revealing that water was mainly mobile this behavior led to inaccurate predictions of solute movement with the ade under shallow groundwater conditions raising the need to apply a model that accounts for a dual porosity soil medium mim that can better describe the solute transport under unsaturated conditions 5 conclusion coupling tracer experiment and inverse modeling with hydrus 1d revealed that solute transport was likely affected by the water table depth which modified the flow field in a silty loam soil solute transport under free drainage conditions was better predicted with the ade equation since the mobile immobile equation indicated the predominance of the mobile phase and high exchange between dead end pores and transfer pores in contrast tracer movement was better described with the mim model under shallow water table conditions wt lysimeters highlighting that the solute was mostly distributed between two domains with a low mobile immobile interaction therefore wetter conditions in the wt treatments induced a strong reduction in λmim and β compared to the fd treatment moreover with shallow water table conditions that strongly modified the soil water content some soil structure changes occurred at the macropore scale 300 µm such that solute transport properties were modified we conclude that groundwater pollution might be worsened by the preferential movement of

4192,a shallow water table might enhance preferential solute movement by modifying both the water flow and solute dynamics in this study we estimated soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters through a tracer experiment in lysimeters comparing different water table levels in a set up of 12 lysimeters the bottom boundary condition was set as a water table depth of 120 cm or 60 cm or as free drainage a tracer solution of bromide 250 mg l 1 40 mm was added to each lysimeter and soil water was sampled with suction cups at different depths for the following 174 days soil water content and matric potential were monitored using tdr probes and electronic tensiometers at the same depths soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters in different soil layers were estimated by inverse modeling using hydrus 1d soil hydraulic parameters were estimated from the mualem van genuchten equations while both the advection dispersion ade and physical non equilibrium mobile immobile water mim models were used to describe the solute transport moreover the soil pore network was analyzed by means of 3d x ray microtomography results showed different solute dynamics between contrasting water table managements with free drainage solute in the immobile domain was negligible and its transport was fully associated with the mobile water flow in contrast a shallow water table affected the tracer transport by modifying a the soil pore network with an increase of the macropores and a reduction of the pore connectivity b the flow field with an increase of immobile water and a reduction of αmim indicating slow exchange between mobile and immobile regions in turn promoting preferential pathways hence groundwater pollution might be worsened by preferential solute transport of agrochemicals occurring with shallow water table conditions keywords hydrus 1d preferential flow tracer test model inversion dispersivity mim x ray microtomography 1 introduction nonpoint source pollution of groundwater caused by fertilizers and agrochemicals is a major issue worldwide chae et al 2004 wu and sun 2016 although the genesis of diffuse agriculture pollution has been investigated for decades understanding solute dynamics in the vadose zone is still challenging soil hydraulic properties show a nonlinear behavior under variably saturated conditions that can vary greatly due to spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the soil pore system kabat et al 1997 vogel et al 2000 further soil hydraulic properties estimated from the laboratory may differ from those in the field due to different soil air displacement conditions basile et al 2003 soil structure can be affected by shrinkage or swelling processes due to drying and wetting cycles or tillage operations that might increase the formation of macropores herbrich and gerke 2017 jirků et al 2013 and in turn enhance the occurrence of preferential flow pathways jarvis et al 2016 kumahor et al 2015 further uncertainty in understanding pollutant transport is related to the groundwater table condition some studies emphasized that evapotranspiration and upward fluxes increased under shallower water table conditions thus minimizing drainage and the risk of groundwater contamination groh et al 2016 in contrast other authors reported that a shorter residence time can be observed in the unsaturated zone when the travel distance between soil surface and groundwater was reduced by particular meteorological and lower boundary conditions e g the occurrence of shallow water table haria et al 2003 sprenger et al 2016 wossenyeleh et al 2020 besides the type of land use this condition would lead to a higher probability of the contaminant reaching the groundwater rahman 2008 and a lower degree of pollutant soil matrix reaction maher 2010 the water table depth might affect the magnitude of solute movement by changing the water content inside the soil system likely leading to preferential flow for instance guo and lin 2018 and haria et al 2003 found that preferential solute movement occurred under shallow water table conditions increasing the risk of solute bypass hendrickx and flury 2001 beven and germann 1982 it was hypothesized that above the capillary fringe the water stored in the soil matrix could be moved to preferential flow pathways when a low amount of rainfall is added to the system krzeminska et al 2014 in such conditions vegetation could enhance the susceptibility to groundwater contamination the roots that grow until the water pool could increase the soil macroporosity by connecting the soil surface and the saturated zone mitchell et al 1995 furthermore preferential flows naturally occur in presence of drying cracks fissures and biopores e g caused by earthworms gerke 2006 when dry soil conditions can favor hydrophobicity deurer and bachmann 2007 or in soils affected by swelling and shrinking processes depending on soil water content changes beven and germann 1982 the geometry and connectivity of water flow might change in porous media where the spatial arrangement between void and solid phases depends on drying wetting cycles sayem and kong 2016 vervoort et al 1999 this can be originated by shallow water table fluctuations that can affect both soil hydraulic and physical properties especially within weakly structured soils pagliai et al 1989 or loamy soils with a high organic matter content gérard et al 2004 modeling methodologies to predict diffuse nutrient and agrochemical pollution are fundamental to identify management zones e g nitrate vulnerable zones and assess alternatives of agroecosystem management solute movement in both saturated and unsaturated porous media is usually simulated with the advection dispersion equation ade application of the ade under equilibrium conditions requires knowledge of dispersive transport parameters such as the dispersivity that are cumbersome to measure directly they can be estimated by inverse modeling fitting ade to field transport data jury and roth 1990 however difficulties in establishing geochemical conditions goldberg et al 2010 and incorrect assumptions about water and solute dynamics and boundary conditions durner et al 2007 can lead to unrealistic estimation of transport parameters such as in the case of non equilibrium flow moreover inverse modelling can be affected by different optimization strategies that e g consider simultaneously or sequentially different type of observation data matric potential solute concentration etc in the objective function groh et al 2018 observations conducted at the lysimeter scale can help to assess the solute behavior when they are combined with numerical simulations klier et al 2008 thuyet et al 2010 in some circumstances lysimeters could lead to a bias due to field boundaries that are difficult to reproduce e g providing a lower boundary exposure to atmospheric pressure flury et al 1999 isch et al 2019 or the disruption of water flow and the hydraulic gradient due to the bottom of the lysimeter itself recently new technologies have been developed to overcome bottom boundary related problem pütz et al 2016 in a high precision lysimeter network adjusted the matric potential at the bottom of the soil profile to the potential measured from the surrounding soil enabling the upward or downward water flux across the bottom of the lysimeter a similar process is described in von unold and fank 2008 however even in their traditional set up they are still key tools to represent real world conditions in a controlled manner better than laboratory columns here an experiment was set up by using twelve lysimeters under two different water table depth conditions and free drainage lysimeters were equipped with probes for continuous monitoring of soil water content and matric potential at different depths and with automated suction cups for soil water sampling we estimated soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters through a bromide tracer experiment and inverse modeling applying both the ade and mobile immobile mim models in a multi layer soil profile our hypothesis was that a shallow water table could affect the solute movement by modifying soil properties and generating preferential solute pathways 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the experimental site this study was conducted at the experimental farm l toniolo of the university of padova in legnaro 45 21 n 11 57 e 8 m a s l northeastern italy the study site was originally set up in 1984 consisting of twenty 1 m 1 m 1 5 m length width depth drainable lysimeters the bottom of each lysimeter is funnel shaped and connected via an underground drain pipe 1 slope to an external tube equipped with a valve that regulates both the water table level and leaching discharge fig 1 a each lysimeter was filled in 1984 with soil excavated from the adjacent experimental farm in a way that preserved the original soil horizons to facilitate water drainage and prevent soil washout a 15 cm thick layer of gravel 30 50 mm diameter covers the bottom of each lysimeter the soil is fluvi calcaric cambisol fao unesco 2008

panalytical ltd spectris company ph and ec were measured by an electrode in soil suspensions with a soil to water ratio of 1 2 5 and 1 2 w v respectively total nitrogen was analyzed with the kjeldahl method soil organic carbon content was determined with a cns analyzer vario macro cube elementar analysensysteme gmbh total and active carbonates with the dietrich fruehling calcimeter and ammonium oxalate titration method respectively available phosphorus with the olsen method and exchangeable potassium by the extraction with ammonium acetate an automated mobile roof fig 1c was built over the whole area allowing control of rain events and water fluxes on lysimeters and preserving the site from destructive weather events fig 1d a weather station decagon devices inc pullman wa consisting of an anemometer wind direction temperature relative humidity probe pyranometer and pluviometer was installed near the experimental site to monitor site specific conditions data were collected using a datalogger em50 data collection system decagon devices inc pullman wa 2 2 automated monitoring and pore water sampling systems an automated monitoring system was installed in 2011 in twelve out of twenty lysimeters with sensors at depths of 15 30 and 60 cm the system consisted of cs635 tdr time domain reflectrometry probes campbell scientific inc lincoln nebraska usa to estimate the volumetric water content t4e electronic tensiometers ums gmbh munich de to measure the soil matric potential and spe20 polyethylene nylon suction cups meter group munich de to collect the mobile water the tdr calibrated in the laboratory had an accuracy of 1 5 to ensure continuity between soils and probes tensiometers and suction cups were installed in horizontal cavities forcing the excess soil slurry previously used to fill the cavities to discharge tdr and tensiometer probes were connected to a cr 10x datalogger campbell scientific inc lincoln nebraska usa through a series of multiplexers the automatized system continuously kept suction equilibrium with the surrounding soil water tension morari 2006 by integrating soil matric potential measurements acquired by the electronic tensiometers with pore water samplers fig 1b e since vacuum applied to the sampling media was constantly regulated during the sampling period the sample solute concentration was more accurate compared with other soil water samplers farsad et al 2012 to regulate continuously the vacuum in pore water samplers based on matric potential a system composed of a 5 volt digital analog conversion module a04a campbell scientific inc lincoln nebraska usa connected to an electronic vacuum regulator incorporating a pressure relief valve itv2091 smc corporation tokyo japan was employed in this way only the solutes that were involved in the mobile flow were sampled by the pore water samplers the imposed negative pressure applied to soil water samplers was in the range of 2 to 70 kpa and was maintained close to the soil water tension readings to overcome pore water sampler resistance and the force with which water was held by soil the imposed negative pressure was set at 2 kpa less than the soil water matric potential readings in the surrounding soil masarik et al 2004 the system overcame frequent vacuum fluctuations of traditional systems that control the suction application duration or that are subjected to vacuum pressure leakage in vacuum tanks farsad et al 2012 in drier soil conditions the automated suction control system was not activated because of the extremely low soil hydraulic conductivity making water sampling inoperative 2 3 experimental design and tracer test since 2011 the experimental site was used to test several combinations of crop and fertilization management with different water table conditions longo et al 2021 in the present study twelve lysimeters were used to evaluate the effect of groundwater management on solute movement under bare soil conditions the bottom boundary condition was set with a water table level at 120 cm wt120 60 cm wt60 and as free drainage fd four replicates hereafter labeled a b c d were used to better govern the soil variability and evaluate differences between treatments the valve at the bottom of each lysimeter was used to regulate manually every day the water table level to the expected values 120 cm or 60 cm despite that groundwater level fluctuations could occur within a maximum of 10 cm in order to investigate solute transport a saline tracer solution of kbr containing a br concentration of 250 mg l 1 was added to every lysimeter at the beginning of the soil water monitoring on november 5th 2013 10 g of br in total with a simulated rain event of 40 mm prior to the tracer test background br concentration of the soil solution was assessed at different depths and in the leaching water concentrations were below the detection limits 0 05 mg l 1 the water sampling started on november 6th 2013 was carried out on a daily time scale in the first week and subsequently at increasing intervals until the end of the experiment april 27th 2014 when the pore water was lastly sampled to evaluate any residual br concentration once collected the water samples were stored at 20 c and then analyzed with ion chromatography dionex ics 900 provided with a conductivity detector model ds 5 and a column ion pac cs12a thermo scientific to measure bromide concentration during the experiment the soil was maintained bare such that total atmospheric water loss was due to evaporation the water input was due only to irrigation referred as simulated rainfall events fig 2 2 4 advection dispersion and mobile immobile water solute transport equations in soil the advection dispersion equation ade is widely used to describe solute transport for fickian flow when all the water molecules are taking part in the flow the ade for transient flow in soil is presented in equation 1 when no adsorption occurs 1 θ c t z θ

averaged pore water velocity cm d 1 and λ is the longitudinal dispersivity cm a parameter that expresses the mixing length of the solute in the soil the ade equation is widely used to simulate solute transport but it cannot sufficiently describe transport in heterogeneous and unsaturated porous media gao et al 2010 when physical non equilibrium occurs the mobile immobile mim equation van genuchten and wierenga 1976 is applied as a modified version of the ade assuming that the water inside micropores mainly intra aggregate pores is stagnant and the solute can be trapped in it hence the water flow and so the solute movement is restricted only to the macropores mainly interaggregate pores and fractures šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 in the mim model the water content θ is divided into two fractions the mobile phase θmo which plays a key role in solute leaching and the immobile phase θim 3 θ θ m o θ i m the mim model uses two equations one for the mobile domain eq 4 and the other for

variably saturated water flow under equilibrium flow conditions by using the mualem van genuchten equation to describe soil hydraulic properties solute transport under equilibrium and physical non equilibrium state was simulated with ade and mim equations respectively first the water flow was modeled applying the inverse solution approach the difference between observed and simulated volumetric soil water content and matric potential at depths of 15 30 and 60 cm was minimized in the objective function which was defined as eq 8 8 φ b y j i m v j i 1 n j w i j y j z t i y j z t i b 2 where φ

optimized soil hydraulic θs αvg n ks and solute transport parameters λade λmim αmim and θim the depth of the soil profile was set at 130 cm and was vertically discretized in 101 nodes 1 3 cm regular mesh size for the soil hydraulic parameters estimation the maximum number of iterations was set at 100 with a number of observed soil water contents and matric potentials at daily time scale that ranged between 880 and 1005 in total matric potential data that were out of range 800 to 1000 cm and outliers were not used for the inverse modelling soil hydraulic parameters of the mualem van genuchten function θs αvg n and ks were estimated for the 0 20 20 45 and 45 130 cm layers for the 174 days of the trial november 4th 2013 to april 27th 2014 the residual soil water content θr was set 0 01 cm3 cm 3 according to previous analysis on the same soil morari 2006 and the conductivity tortuosity l was 0 5 mualem 1976 fixed values were used a to reduce the number of unknown parameters b because preliminary analysis including θr and l as variables did not improve the accuracy of the results c due to their low sensitivity under the specific soil experimental conditions e g mostly in the wet range wösten and van genuchten 1988 potential evapotranspiration rates and rainfall events were set as upper boundary conditions while a seepage face in free drainage fd and variable pressure heads describing daily fluctuations of water table levels in wt60 and wt120 were set as bottom boundary conditions potential evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the hargreaves equation multiplied by the crop coefficient for bare soil kc 1 15 allen et al 2005 hereafter referred as potential evaporation as reported in fig 2 initial conditions were set in soil water content by using soil moisture data recorded by tdrs at the beginning of the experiment at the three corresponding observation points 15 30 and 60 cm depth then the variability of soil water content along depth was estimated by a linear scaling procedure based on vogel et al 1991 after soil hydraulic properties solute transport parameters at different depths were estimated the objective function was defined in terms of bromide concentration data i e y j in eq 8 as function of time and depth weighted by the standard deviation for this purpose two different equations were used a the ade to estimate dispersivity λade b the mim physical non equilibrium model to estimate dispersivity λmim mass transfer coefficient αmim and immobile soil water content θim boundary conditions for solute transport were set as concentration flux of the infiltrating water 250 mg l 1 of bromide and lower zero concentration gradient at the outflow bromide water diffusion was set at 1 6 cm2 d 1 leistra and boesten 2010 lide 2003 and the soil water adsorption coefficient kd was set as zero due to its negligible sorption ladu and zhang 2011 the maximum number of iterations was set at 10 with a number of observed bromide flux concentrations in the objective function that ranged between 25 and 100 previously estimated soil hydraulic parameters were used as soil information for the solute transport simulations to test the goodness of fit between observed and predicted values three statistical approaches were used the coefficient of determination r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and the root mean square error rmse these statistical parameters were chosen for their ability to compare comprehensively the goodness of fit of simulation models power 1993 zeng et al 2014 in general the best fit was represented by rmse close to 0 and nse and r2 close to 1 afterward the fraction of mobile water β was calculated as the ratio between the mobile θmo θ θim see eq 3 and the total soil water content θ vervoort et al 1999 when no adsorption occurs van genuchten and wierenga 1976 since β is dependent on θ the averaged θ θavg during the 174 days experimental trial was calculated for all lysimeters and used to compute β 2 6 procedure of inverse modeling for parameter optimization the procedure of inverse modelling in a multi layer soil profile can be applied using a simultaneous groh et al 2018 or a sequential šimůnek et al 2001 approach for the estimation of soil hydraulic and solute parameters in our case the sequential approach was necessary to minimize problems of non uniqueness due to the high number of parameters to be optimized diederik et al 2002 hopmans et al 2002 a stepwise layer by layer procedure starting from the top applied to each lysimeter was performed first the soil profile was assumed homogeneous and hydraulic parameters were optimized against daily soil water contents measured by tdrs and matric potentials measured by tensiometers at the corresponding depth the initial values of hydraulic parameters were estimated based on the pedotransfer functions already implemented in hydrus 1d using particle size distribution and bulk density data after the first run the obtained hydraulic parameters were fixed in the first layer 0 20 cm and a two layer soil profile 0 20 20 130 cm was defined to optimize the parameters in the second one the procedure was performed until parameters in all three layers were optimized when all the hydraulic parameters were estimated some further tuning was done by re estimating the same parameters of different layers until no further improvement was achieved after that solute transport parameters were optimized starting from initial values of 5 cm 0 1 cm3 cm 3 and 0 5 d 1 for λ θ i m and αmim respectively parameter optimization for both hydraulic and solute transport modeling was based on the levenberg marquardt method to minimize the target function marquardt 1963 the weights associated with the observed data were manually set as 1 since data were automatically weighted by standard deviation by hydrus 1d isch et al 2019 2 7 x ray computed microtomography to identify additional pore structure properties one undisturbed soil core 7 cm diameter 5 cm height was collected after the tracer test in each tested lysimeter totally 12 using as hand auger eijkelkamp the netherlands at a depth of 25 to 30 cm and analyzed by means of x ray microtomography µct before analysis soil cores were equilibrated at 60 cm matric potential with a sandbox apparatus to ensure uniform conditions after that they were gently

nrecon software version 1 6 9 4 bruker microct belgium to obtain a stack of at least 1500 2d images in 8 bit depth the final voxel resolution was 27 25 µm in all three directions after reducing noise with a 3 3 3 median filter the reconstructed greyscale volumes were segmented into binary images i e soil pores and matrix using a clustering based threshold method otsu 1979 soil porosity detected by µct 27 25 2834 µm was calculated by dividing the number of pore voxels by the total number of voxels of the analyzed volume the 3d mean pore diameter and pore size classes were estimated by using a sphere fitting method at intervals of two voxels that determines the local thickness of every medial axis pore voxel remy and thiel 2002 pore classes were divided into micropores 27 25 327 00 µm and macropores 327 00 µm to emphasize the contribution of the large pores to possible non equilibrium flow jarvis 2007 the euler number by calculating the number of redundant connections between pores per unit volume mm 3 was used as an estimate of local pore connectivity that becomes increasingly by negative with increasing connectivity and increasingly by positive with decreasing connectivity vogel

data total water input as simulated rainfall during the experimental period was 638 1 mm fig 2 starting november 5th with 40 mm the highest input was observed on march 1st when 55 6 mm of simulated rain fell on the lysimeters in one day from the beginning until february 16th the potential evaporation from bare soil was always lower than 1 6 mm d 1 and after it increased to a maximum value of 5 4 mm d 1 on april 25th soil water content dynamics observed during the experimental trial november 5th 2013 april 27th 2014 showed that free drainage fd lysimeters were always drier than wt120 and wt60 fig 3 at the beginning of the experiment before any simulated rainfall event the soil water content was mainly affected by the water table management condition in fact the free drainage lysimeters average of four replicates showed soil water content of about 0 129 0 024 cm3 cm 3 at 15 cm and increased up to 0 193 0 006 cm3 cm 3 and 0 222 0 001 cm3 cm 3 respectively at 30 cm and 60 cm depth higher initial soil water content within the soil profile was observed in wt120 0 257 0 006 0 332 0 023 0 412 0 002 cm3 cm 3 and reached maxima in wt60 0 334 0 02 0 370 0 011 and 0 414 0 004 cm3 cm 3 after subsequent simulated rainfall events that amounted to 120 mm november 5th 7th 2013 soil water content in fd rapidly increased reaching 0 280 0 018 0 363 0 006 and 0 370 0 012 cm3 cm 3 at 15 30 and 60 cm respectively in particular stronger fluctuations were observed at 15 cm that were smoothed and slightly delayed in deeper layers during the experimental trial fd had on average 0 266 0 017 cm3 cm 3 0 357 0 006 cm3 cm 3 and 0 390 0 002 cm3 cm 3 at 15 30 and 60 cm respectively while the maximum and minimum values were 0 349 and 0 141 0 403 and 0 183 0 441 and 0 220 cm3 cm 3 at the same depth in general during the experiment soil water content in the surface layer was always lower than at 30 cm and 60 cm similar soil water content dynamics were observed in wt120 and wt60 at 15 cm and 30 cm showing a peak after each rainfall event in contrast at 60 cm the soil water content was slightly affected by additional water input due to higher initial soil water content conditions the soil water content gradient was reduced in wt120 and wt60 compared to fd mainly at 15 cm this was particularly noticeable in wt60 when the topsoil water content reached similar values or even higher than those in the subsoil at 30 and 60 cm due to simulated rainfall events notably similar soil water contents close to saturation about 0 43 cm3 cm 3 were found at 60 cm in both wt120 and wt60 despite being managed according to different water table levels furthermore in wt lysimeters maximum and minimum values were higher with respect to the free drainage condition showing similar maximum water contents reached along the depths minimum recorded values were lower mostly in wt60 0 160 0 336 and 0 386 cm3 cm 3 at 15 30 and 60 cm than wt120 0 248 0 291 and 0 409 cm3 cm 3 at 15 30 and 60 cm except for the intermediate depth suggesting wider fluctuations in wt60 lysimeters similar observations were reported by measured pressure head dynamics fig 4 with wider fluctuations that were found in fd lysimeters compared to smoother dynamics as observed in wt120 and especially wt60 after each simulated rainfall event the matric potential increased sharply until values always 50 cm in all lysimeters regardless the water table management notably the effect of a shallow water table was recorded by the tensiometers with values above 0 cm especially when the water table was set at 60 cm depth in some cases this was also observed in wt120 when simulated rainfalls of at least 40 mm occurred with high frequency 3 2 soil water dynamics and hydraulic parameters estimation with hydrus 1d soil water contents were well simulated by hydrus 1d fig 3 but in some cases mostly at 15 cm the model showed an excessive sensitivity to predict wide and frequent soil water content fluctuations particularly in fd lysimeters in contrast the sharp increase of volumetric water content after rainfall events at 30 and 60 cm depth and the following slower drying dynamics were well described in case of pressure heads simulation fig 4 the model showed higher fluctuations at 15 cm as reported for water contents but good predictions at the deeper depths indeed the close fitting between measured and modeled water contents was indicated by the goodness of inverse operations table s1 for all the treatments generally the best fit was found in wt120 while the lowest was in wt60d r2 0 619 rmse 0 030 nse 0 198 in general water contents in fd lysimeters were well estimated according to high r2 and nse and low rmse furthermore inverted parameters well described the soil water dynamics of all lysimeters at the three soil layers fig 3 the goodness of fit of simulated vs observed matric heads was generally lower than water contents table s1 the best fit was found for wt lysimeters r2 ranging from 0 284 to 0 786 except for wt60a which showed a negative nse 0 124 similar results were reported for fdc and fdd r2 0 430 and 0 377 nse 1 222 and 2 416 respectively mostly due to a general underestimation of the matric potential by the model estimated saturated soil water content table 2 and fig s1 was generally lower in the topsoil layer 0 392 0 015 cm3 cm 3 at 0 20 cm than in the subsoil up to 0 429 0 004 cm3 cm 3 at 45 130 cm with slight variability between treatments at the topsoil the air entry potential αvg was 0 013 0 003 cm 1 similar to the intermediate one 0 010 0 001 cm 1 while the deep layers showed halved αvg 0 006 0 002 cm 1 a tendency to lower n values was observed in the 45 130 cm layer 1 17 0 02 compared to 0 20 1 34 0 00 and 20 45 cm 1 20 0 01 which indicated a flatter pore size distribution at the greatest depth table 2 saturated hydraulic conductivity varied between treatments in general showing higher values in fd 45 70 28 76 cm d 1 on average while in wt120 and wt60 values were 14 21 6 20 cm d 1 and 19 26 3 38 cm d 1 greatest ks values were found in the deepest layer of fd 101 11 25 62 cm d 1 showing a most pronounced increase with depth than wt lysimeters 3 3 experimental bromide movement in lysimeters experimental bromide concentration dynamics at different depths mg l 1 are shown in figs 5 and s2 dots describing the 174 day monitoring from november 5th 2013 until april 27th 2014 in fd the first water sampling was delayed until november 13th because of the very dry conditions at the beginning of the experiment figs 3 and 4 almost two weeks after application of br and 160 mm of simulated rainfall the highest concentrations were detected at 15 cm reaching 75 mg l 1 in lysimeters fdb and fdc concentrations sharply decreased to values 5 mg l 1 one month after application at increasing depths concentration peaks were shifted a few days later 1 8 bromide concentrations were never higher than 40 mg l 1 at 30 cm depth and even lower at 60 cm thirty days after the br application and 360 mm of water input bromide concentrations were almost steady at values close to 1 mg l 1 or below wt treatments exhibited earlier arrival of br than fd bromide was first detected the day after application 6th of november at concentrations up to 90 mg l 1 the fast br movement was emphasized in wt120 when it showed a peak at 30 cm on november 8th 48 4 mg l 1 on average followed by a peak at 60 cm starting november 12th especially in lysimeter wt120a reaching a maximum concentration of 35 mg l 1 wt60 showed a similar trend compared to wt120 at the surface and intermediate sampling points in all wt60 lysimeters the br had a peak above 80 mg l 1 detected at 15 cm that gradually dropped to about 5 mg l 1 after one month at 30 cm the peak was reached on november 12th detected also at 15 cm due to a 40 mm irrigation and then decreased to approximately 10 mg l 1 at the end of the experiment at 60 cm br was detected immediately after the 15 and 30 cm sampling but a peak of concentration was never found these dynamics highlighted the fluctuating effect of the shallow water table which likely enhanced br dilution as well hindered its complete leaching 3 4 modeled solute transport dynamics and parameterization with hydrus 1d model performance metrics of bromide dynamic using ade and mim are reported in table 3 the fitting showed better values with mim than ade in all the treatments in general r2 and nse were higher and rmse lower using mim confirming a better model efficiency the model performance with mim also changed between lysimeters indicating that in a few cases unsatisfactory predictions occurred e g wt60b in which nse was negative modeled dynamics with mim are shown in figs 5 and s3 hydrus 1d simulated initially high peaks of bromide mostly in the fd treatment max 170 mg l 1 at 15 and 30 cm depths followed by a fast decrease black and red lines that reached concentrations close to 0 mg l 1 after 35 40 days in fd br at 60 cm depth grey line showed delayed and lower peaks 40 mg l 1 compared to 15 and 30 cm with final estimated concentrations close to 5 mg l 1 in contrast wt lysimeters mostly showed lower initial peaks of bromide than fd lysimeters that flattened after 20 days to concentrations close to 0 mg l 1 at 15 and 30 cm except for wt60a at 60 cm hydrus 1d was not always able to predict br concentration dynamics as observed in the upper layers fig 5 e g wt120c solute transport parameters from inverse modeling are shown in table s2 for the ade and table 4 for the mim model very high dispersivity values for ade λade were found at the surface layer of both wt120 211 5 38 5 cm and wt60 152 3 45 7 cm lysimeters in fd λade was much lower generally decreasing with depth as wt lysimeters large values of λ and the poor fit table 3 using ade indicated likely non equilibrium conditions radcliffe and šimůnek 2010 by applying the physical non equilibrium model the mim dispersivity λmim was reduced compared to the ade in wt treatments mobile immobile dispersivity at the surface layer 0 20 cm of wt60 was 21 7 9 2 cm on average whereas higher values were found in wt120 32 7 11 3 cm in contrast wt120 showed larger λmim than wt60 at the deepest soil layer with an average value of 16 5 9 6 cm and 14 7 2 7 cm respectively in some cases λmim in fd showed values similar to results reported using ade fda and fdd mostly results from inverse modeling showed that the degree of solute exchange between the immobile and mobile region αmim d 1 changed among treatments this suggested a diverse contribution of immobile water to solute transport either with low frequency as described by small αmim values mostly in wt treatments or high frequency as described by large αmim values mostly in the topsoil layer in fd and deepest layer in wt120 free drainage was strongly differentiated from wt even in terms of mobile water fraction in that β estimates for free drainage were generally close to 1 θim very low whereas for wt treatments they were much lower revealed by higher θim 3 5 pore network characterization by means of x ray computed microtomography soil porosity in the range 27 25 2834 00 µm decreased from 0 15 0 01 cm3 cm 3 in fd to 0 11 0 03 cm3 cm 3 in wt120 and 0 08 cm3 cm 3 in wt60 table 5 the macroporosity 327 00 µm was 35 3 9 9 of the µct detected soil porosity in fd while increased up to 40 4 3 6 in wt120 and 50 7 6 8 in wt60 to note the high pore size class variability of fd that was due to a single macropore observed in just one soil core i e fdb the euler number was always negative suggesting that pores with multiple connections dominated over single isolated pores lower euler number values were found in fd 0 92 0 33 10 2 mm 3 compared to wt120 0 45 0 19 10 2 mm 3 and wt60 0 12 0 03 10 2 mm 3 a visual inspection of the pore structure in some example images fig 6 highlighted the different network organization between treatments with an increasing number of large macropores where the water table occurred 4 discussion modeling of soil hydraulic parameters with hydrus 1d highlighted only slight differences of soil water retention parameters between groundwater management systems similar water retention and saturated conductivity data were already reported in previous studies using the same cambisol dal ferro et al 2015 morari 2006 emphasizing the accuracy of the inverse modeling as well as the ability of the water flow equilibrium model to describe soil water content dynamics nevertheless some uncertainty in hydraulic parameter estimation was observed especially in soil layers with permanent high soil water content isch et al 2019 a detailed investigation of the pore network provided by µct analysis revealed some subtle structure changes between treatments fig 6 with an increase in the macropore structure 327 µm when the water table was set at 120 and 60 cm depth table 5 consequently we cannot exclude that a fraction of water was moved by preferential flow especially at the beginning of the experiment when dry soil conditions occurred however from our experimental results the deeper layers did not respond to rainfall events earlier than the shallower graham and lin 2011 and from simulations its magnitude was not relevant to justify the use of water flow non equilibrium models this contrasts with results on solute transport where the physical mim non equilibrium model seemed the most suitable to describe br movement table 3 especially under wt treatments according to our results previous studies adopted similar estimation process of soil hydraulic properties the use of single porosity models in variably saturated porous media and solute transport parameters with both ade and mim abbasi et al 2004 diederik et al 2002 isch et al 2019 highlighting that physical non equilibrium processes can take place when the soil profile is non uniform and the structure heterogeneity can create differences either in water pressure or solute concentrations or both jarvis 2007 modeling of br movement with the ade showed limitations in describing the solute movement in the wt treatment soils because dispersivity λade especially in the unsaturated layers was often much higher than the transport distance with high standard errors tables 3 and s2 suggesting preferential solute movement vervoort et al 1999 the ade assumes a high degree of mixing among flow paths that is unlikely to occur when macropores extend a column length as suggested by contrasting results between fd and wt treatments the only exception was the saturated layer in the wt treatments 45 130 cm where λade never exceeded the transport distance this is in accordance with some authors which indicated that ade is suitable to describe solute movement under saturated conditions padilla et al 1999 in contrast the mim model was able to describe the solute exchange between mobile and immobile regions of the soil pores maraqa et al 1997 zeng et al 2014 above the shallow water table the modelling results were supported by experimental µct analyses on the pore structure despite being conducted on small cores and at a single depth the higher frequency of macropores under wt conditions compared to fd was associated with rapid non equilibrium flow jarvis 2007 the only exception was fdb whose macropores represented 60 of total investigated porosity range 27 25 2834 00 µm it follows that some effect of shallow water table fluctuations in modifying the soil pore arrangement cannot be completely excluded guo and lin 2018 for instance lysimeters were cultivated with maize under similar water table conditions before the present experiment longo et al 2021 therefore it can be hypothesized a different redistribution of crop root biomass with depth instead swelling or shrinkage processes would be limited being the soil under investigation a silt loam with low organic matter content these findings were further supported by the positive relationship that was observed between the macropore class and the depth weighted dispersivity λade value that was calculated for each lysimeter fig 7 a it is worth of note the high representativeness of macropores in fdb an outlier with respect to the other fd that was associated with very high modelled dispersivity in addition macropores frequency was negatively correlated with the euler number fig 7b the lower the value the higher the degree of pore connectivity supporting the conceptual model described by jarvis et al 2012 and also validated by larsbo et al 2014 according to which the strongest preferential transport would occur in soils that contain macropores that lack well connected networks with smaller pores dispersivity was different in the wt120 and wt60 treatments using the mim model especially in the topsoil layer here higher λmim in the wt120 treatment than the wt60 might be associated with unsaturated conditions that likely increased the tortuous path of mechanical dispersion sometimes exceeding the transport distance λmim 20 cm the behavior of β and αmim parameters indirectly supports the hypothesis of preferential solute movement under wt treatment conditions theoretically when β equals 1 and αmim is high the mim results align with ade results downplaying the role of preferential solute movement as observed in fd lysimeters therefore in the fd treatment solute in the immobile domain was negligible in turn making the transfer coefficient αmim no longer relevant comegna et al 2001 instead in the wt treatment the β parameter changed with depth due to water table fluctuations which created intermittent saturated unsaturated conditions figs 3 and 4 especially under intermediate soil water contents about 0 30 0 40 cm3 cm 3 the fraction of mobile water was broadly variable decreasing from 0 65 0 08 when the soil water content was relatively low 0 35 cm3 cm 3 in wt120 topsoil layer to 0 30 0 06 when the soil water content increased to values 0 35 cm3 cm 3 in wt120 20 130 cm layer wt60 topsoil layer on the contrary it was found that β slightly increased when close to saturation conditions were found i e below the 20 cm layer under wt60 0 55 0 12 and 0 37 0 14 at the intermediate and deep layer respectively and at the deepest layer of wt120 0 54 0 09 this might suggest that different solute dynamics occurred with varying groundwater management and soil water contents this was confirmed also by αmim estimation in the deepest layer close to saturation conditions of the wt120 treatment the average value was 42 29 12 23 d 1 while under the wt60 treatment it was widely lower 0 07 0 01 d 1 highlighting a diverse contribution of the immobile water domain on solute dynamic according to wt management according to comegna et al 2001 low values of β and αmim are indication of preferential solute transport to note that even fdb despite being characterized by a soil structure similar to wt followed the same solute transport dynamics as per the other free drainage lysimeters in turn corroborating that solute mixing and flow was due to the combined effect of structure properties jarvis et al 2012 and soil water content conditions kumahor et al 2015 affecting the connectivity of the water phase the relationship between soil water content and averaged β reported in fig 8 corroborated our previous findings notably β decreased as the soil water content increased until close to saturation conditions due to the shallow water table a similar dynamic was previously observed by toride et al 2003 in a column experiment using dune sand in unsaturated conditions vervoort et al 1999 observed a different mobile water dynamics according to different saturation levels in fact for frequently and intermittent saturated horizons i e deep and intermediate layers of wt they found that β had low to moderate values while for unsaturated horizons e g fd and topsoil layer in wt120 β resulted in higher values in accordance with that we observed that preferential solute transport increased under shallow water table conditions until non capillary macropores were empty in such conditions a significant capillary fringe can take place and additional water input would converge part of water and solutes stored in the soil matrix into preferential pathways thus making macropores more active krzeminska et al 2014 it follows that a likely hydraulic instability between the water filled network of smaller pores and the macropores occurred leading to large variation of local transport velocities beven and germann 1982 larsbo et al 2014 in contrast free drainage conditions did not follow the same dynamic revealing that water was mainly mobile this behavior led to inaccurate predictions of solute movement with the ade under shallow groundwater conditions raising the need to apply a model that accounts for a dual porosity soil medium mim that can better describe the solute transport under unsaturated conditions 5 conclusion coupling tracer experiment and inverse modeling with hydrus 1d revealed that solute transport was likely affected by the water table depth which modified the flow field in a silty loam soil solute transport under free drainage conditions was better predicted with the ade equation since the mobile immobile equation indicated the predominance of the mobile phase and high exchange between dead end pores and transfer pores in contrast tracer movement was better described with the mim model under shallow water table conditions wt lysimeters highlighting that the solute was mostly distributed between two domains with a low mobile immobile interaction therefore wetter conditions in the wt treatments induced a strong reduction in λmim and β compared to the fd treatment moreover with shallow water table conditions that strongly modified the soil water content some soil structure changes occurred at the macropore scale 300 µm such that solute transport properties were modified we conclude that groundwater pollution might be worsened by the preferential movement of

4193,modernizing traditional irrigation systems has long been recognized as a means to reduce water losses however empirical evidence shows that this practice may not necessarily reduce water use in the long run in fact in many cases the converse is true a concept known as the rebound phenomenon this phenomenon is at the heart of a fundamental research gap in the explicit evaluation of co evolutionary dynamics and interactions among socio economic and hydrologic factors in agricultural systems this gap calls for the application of systems based methods to evaluate such dynamics to address this gap we use a previously developed agent based agricultural water demand abad model applied to the bow river basin brb in canada we perform a time varying variance based global sensitivity analysis gsa on the abad model to examine the individual effect of factors as well as their joint effect that may give rise to the rebound phenomenon in the brb our results show that economic factors dominantly control possible rebounds although social interaction among farmers is found to be less influential than the irrigation expansion factor its interaction effect with other factors becomes more important indicating the highly interactive nature of the underlying socio hydrological system based on the insights gained via gsa we discuss several strategies including community participation and water restrictions that can be adopted to avoid the rebound phenomenon in irrigation systems this study demonstrates that a time varying variance based gsa can provide a better understanding of the co evolutionary dynamics of the socio hydrological systems and can pave the way for better management of water resources keywords socio hydrology time varying sensitivity analysis agent based

better use of water than traditional irrigation systems however empirical evidence shows that this reduction may motivate farmers to expand irrigated areas which may in turn lead to an increase in water use berbel and mateos 2014 berbel et al 2014 food and agriculture organization fao 2017 in complex coupled human natural systems this concept is known as the rebound phenomenon this phenomenon occurs when increasing technological efficiency counter intuitively leads to an overall increase in water use in the long term a concept first observed in the field of energy as the jevons paradox

of social hydrological systems can provide critical insights needed in policy making to achieve sustainability iwanaga et al 2021 razavi et al 2020 ghoreishi et al 2021 developed a socio hydrological agent based model abm applied in the bow river basin brb in canada to examine the agricultural rebound phenomenon their model called the agent based agricultural water demand abad model captures the dynamic behaviors of individual farmers in upgrading on farm irrigation systems and or changing crop patterns the brb is an important sub basin of the saskatchewan river basin saskrb which has faced water security issues in recent years gober and wheater 2014 wheater and gober 2013 according to the literature of jevons paradox in agriculture e g berbel et al 2014 sears et al 2018 when efficient irrigation systems reduce the marginal cost of irrigation and water use a profit maximizing farmer may increase water use mainly by 1 expanding the irrigated area and or 2 switching to high value crops that are also more water intensive the abad model in the brb embeds this mechanism to reproduce the rebound phenomenon ghoreishi et al 2021 in addition compared to the models that demonstrate the agricultural rebound phenomenon based on decisions driven by strictly economic incentives e g gómez and pérez blanco 2014 the abad model adopts an alternative structure in three ways ghoreishi et al 2021 first unlike models that are based on the assumption that humans maximize their benefits or producers maximize profit abad uses a bounded rationality decision structure whereby agents have imperfect knowledge of system relationships and values and are only able to seek satisficing solutions rather than optimal ones epstein 1999 gigerenzer and selten 2001 simon 1955 second most models in the literature have been constructed with economic decision making rules driven by market based price incentives e g gómez and pérez blanco 2014 huffaker 2008 whereas the abad model includes economic and social factors e g social interaction among farmers influencing farmers decision making third as opposed to the conceptual or theoretical nature of many of the available models e g huffaker 2008 the abad model represented an empirical application and was tested in the brb ghoreishi et al 2021 investigated the essential socio economic factors in farmers decision making for water demand as well as the relationship between these factors and water demand dynamics however a major research question was unanswered in that work how can we avoid the agricultural rebound phenomenon socio hydrological modeling of different complex phenomena has advanced our understanding of coupled human natural systems di baldassarre et al 2019 however an explicit evaluation of the co evolutionary dynamics and interactions among socioeconomic factors that would prevent problematic behavior including the agricultural rebound phenomenon is a fundamental research gap this gap calls for the application of systems based methodologies that can attribute the systems scale effect of individual factors and their interaction over the entire factor space in this paper we argue that time varying global sensitivity analysis gsa razavi and gupta 2019 as a powerful method for systems analysis can unravel the extent to which different time varying dimensions of co evolutionary dynamics influence the rebound phenomenon furthermore this method identifies interactions among model factors parameter interaction and can reveal hidden behaviors of models and the underlying systems razavi et al 2021 saltelli et al 2008 sheikholeslami and razavi 2020 the concept of parameter interaction implies that independent factors influence the model response in a non additive manner it is noteworthy that computation and interpretation of the interactions among factors are nontrivial and challenging razavi and gupta 2015 as well although various gsa methods e g derivative based and variance based methods use different philosophies to estimate parameter interactions the variance based method can provide a meaningful global estimation of interactions among model factors considerable literature has been published on the application of gsa to coupled human natural systems with abms e g becu et al 2003 brown and robinson 2006 burke et al 2006 li and liu 2007 ligmann zielinska and sun 2010 schlüter and pahl wostl 2007 most of the previous studies used a time invariant model output or an aggregated model output as a system response for sensitivity analysis an et al 2005 becu et al 2003 schlüter and pahl wostl 2007 these aggregate system responses can lead to a loss of valuable information about the time varying nature of the model behavior and cannot provide comprehensive insight into the co evolutionary dynamics of the underlying system ligmann zielinska and sun 2010 richiardi et al 2006 wagener et al 2001 alternatively a time varying gsa offers detailed information on how variability in model factors affects the dynamics of the model outputs gupta and razavi 2018 ligmann zielinska and sun 2010 razavi and gupta 2019 this type of analysis can deepen the understanding of the co evolutionary dynamics of complex phenomena in water management thus providing insights into future water planning however interpretations of gsa results are constrained by the adopted models which usually represent interactions between human and natural systems simply and imperfectly although this simplicity is essential to model such complex systems elshafei et al 2016 thus findings based on any model should be treated with caution before being generalized to the underlying real world system for sustainable water management the objective of this study is twofold 1 to assess time varying socio economic factors that influence the agricultural rebound phenomenon and 2 to explore ways to avoid the agricultural rebound phenomenon to support sustainable water management for the first objective we perform a time varying gsa on the abad model which can adequately represent the dynamics of agricultural water demand in response to farmers adaptation to drought i e adopting sprinkler irrigation systems and changing crop patterns in the brb this time varying gsa on the abad model provides valuable information about the dynamical nature of the model behavior and comprehensive insights into the co evolutionary dynamics of the underlying system for the second objective we use the results of the time varying gsa and the gained insights to explore strategies to control the agricultural rebound phenomenon with the support of literature 2 rebound phenomenon in agriculture recent studies have demonstrated that the rebound phenomenon can emerge in the context of agricultural water use using empirical evidence pfeiffer and lin 2014 song et al 2018 or theoretical research qureshi et al 2010 scheierling et al 2006 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 agricultural water use comprises 1 beneficial evapotranspiration which improves crop production 2 non beneficial evaporation in which water unnecessarily evaporates from wet bare soil or sprinkler system water 3 non recoverable runoff percolation and 4 recoverable runoff percolation burt et al 1997 both recoverable and non recoverable runoff percolation as well as part of the non beneficial evaporation can be reduced through improvements in irrigation systems in this regard the agricultural rebound phenomenon can be described as follows improving the efficiency of irrigation systems has generally been viewed as a means to reduce water losses as a result farmers adopt more efficient irrigation systems through government subsidies or self financing thus decreasing water use however the saved water may in turn encourage farmers to increase their irrigated area or shift to more water demanding crops which in the long run can increase water use in a river basin two approaches have been used to assess the agricultural rebound phenomenon a few studies have used price elasticity as a proxy to represent the rebound phenomenon as they suggested a close relationship between price elasticity and the dynamics of water demand gómez and gutierrez 2011 song et al 2018 the second method directly compares the agricultural water use before and after shifting to efficient irrigation systems lecina et al 2010 pfeiffer and lin 2014 song et al 2018 1 r w e w n w e w i where r is the agricultural rebound index w e mcm is the expected water use after irrigation efficiency improvement w n mcm is the new water use after irrigation efficiency improvement and w i mcm is the initial water use before irrigation efficiency improvement the agricultural rebound index is calculated over a time window for example considering 2002 as the reference year the agricultural rebound indices in 2006 and 2010 represent water demand dynamics in the periods 2002 2006 and 2002 2010 respectively from eq 1 a rebound r of say 0 3 represents that 30 of the expected water saving is offset by increased water use the denominator in eq 1 is always negative in the sign inspired by the field of energy saunders 2008 five conditions of interest can be realized in eq 1 backfire r 1 the new water use after irrigation efficiency improvement exceeds the initial water use before irrigation efficiency improvement see the empirical evidence by lecina et al 2010 and pfeiffer and lin 2014 full rebound r 1 the new water use after irrigation efficiency improvement equals the initial water use before irrigation efficiency improvement partial rebound 0 r 1 the new water use after irrigation efficiency improvement exceeds the expected water use through irrigation efficiency improvement however the new water use is still less than the initial water use see the empirical evidence by song et al 2018 zero rebound r 0 the new water use after irrigation efficiency improvement equals the expected water use through irrigation efficiency improvement super conservation r 0 the new water use after irrigation efficiency improvement is less than the expected water use through irrigation efficiency improvement see the empirical evidence by lópez gunn et al 2012 fig 1 shows our conceptualization of the rebound phenomenon in agriculture by dividing it into four phases 1 orientation phase 2 ideal phase 3 growth phase and 4 backfire phase in phase 1 governments generally introduce a conservation policy e g technical assistance or financial incentives to adopt more efficient irrigation systems with a specific goal of water savings in phase 2 the agricultural water use almost reaches the pre determined purpose of the program r 0 however this ideal phase can be followed by the growth phase an increase in agricultural water use due to several side effects 0 r 1 this pattern may finally lead to phase4 the backfire phase in which the new water use is even more than the initial water use r 1 3 methodology 3 1 description of the abad model in brb the brb is located in semi arid southern alberta canada while the annual precipitation in the headwaters of this basin ranges from 500 to 700 mm the low land areas of the basin which include the city of calgary has an annual precipitation of 412 mm bow river basin council 2010 around 80 of bow river water is provided by snowmelt from the rocky mountains and the rest of the water source is from rain groundwater and glacial melt bow river basin council 2010 alberta is required to pass 50 of the natural annual flow to downstream based on the master agreement on apportionment prairie provinces water board 1969 in 2010 the agricultural sector accounted for 71 of total water allocation in the brb bow river basin council 2010 as the water source is fully allocated in the brb no new applications for water allocation are accepted alberta queen s printer 2000 the abad model consists of two submodels the monthly water submodel and the yearly human submodel see table a1 for a summary of the main equations variables and factors in the abad model the water submodel of abad is a lumped monthly water demand model which is based on the one developed by the united states department of agriculture 1970 this model accounts for the soil moisture and meteorological data the human submodel simulates the individual farmers as agents 2000 agents based on the brb population these agents make three decisions adopting sprinkler systems changing crops and expanding irrigated areas agents switch from the flood to sprinkler irrigation system to conserve water their second conservation decision is to change from forages to other crops that require less water when agents save water through their water conservation decisions they may expand their irrigated area to benefit from the full amount of their water license table a2 the agents make their decisions based on several socio economic factors conservation policy future profits past profits risk aversion environmental protection social interaction and willingness to expand irrigation ghoreishi et al 2021 the government defines conservation policy according to a given government budget and economic considerations with the case study of brb for example a water conservation target of 30 means that the government plans to reduce the water demand by 30 over a given period with an assumed policy instrument of financial support of the adoption of water efficient irrigation technology the future profits represent the expected gross margin per hectare through conservation in addition to variable costs agents consider the subsidies provided by the government to improve irrigation systems the past profits follow the same idea but it represents the agents memory from their past gross margins risk aversion suggests the degree to which farmers deviate from their past decisions on water conservation environmental protection shows the extent to which agents conserve water in favor of the environment social interaction indicates the degree to which farmers decisions are affected by their neighbors a willingness to expand irrigation suggests the degree to which an agent uses the saved water to expand irrigation to make yearly decisions agents use different weights for socio economic factors the weights show the relative importance of each factor for the agents conservation decisions in the abad model these weights are sampled from specified probability distributions i e normal distributions which represent the heterogeneity in a farming society in terms of farmers decision making processes following ghoreishi et al 2021 we used the ranges of the abad model factors shown in table 1 this table shows the lower and upper bounds of means and standard deviations of the normal distributions corresponding to the specified socio economic factors the upper bound of the mean for yearly conservation goal μ c is assigned based on the target in the water for life program i e 2 of the total irrigated area was targeted to be under the water conservation program on average each year alberta irrigation projects association 2015 the mean for irrigation expansion is based on the historical data while individual farmers can expand their irrigation above or below the historical records besides a large boundary for standard deviations is defined to test the abad model s performance ghoreishi et al 2021 used a multi objective approach for the calibration and validation process the abad model was calibrated on two of its three outputs i e water demand and irrigation system area and validated on the other output i e cropping patterns ghoreishi et al 2021 indicated that the abad model showed a good model performance in simulating agricultural water demand in the brb thus this model is a good candidate for further analysis of the water demand dynamics and the brb rebound phenomenon 3 2 time varying variance based gsa to improve the understanding of the co evolutionary dynamics of the rebound phenomenon we conducted a time varying variance based gsa on the abad model s rebound index r while identifying the most influential model factors over time we investigated the extent to which the interactions among the socio economic factors are important in giving rise to the variability of the model response the variance based method is capable of exploring the interactions among model factors saltelli et al 2008 for k model factors the variance of the rebound index v can be decomposed by the following variance decomposition formula gómez delgado and tarantola 2006 saisana et al 2005 2 v i v i i j v ij i j m v ijm v 12 k where v i represents the portion of the rebound index variance that can be explained by varying an individual factor x i on the other hand v ij denotes the portion of the rebound index variance explained by the interaction between x i and x j and so on for higher order interactions v ijm using the aforementioned variance decomposition the first order main effect si and total effect interaction effect sti indices sobol indices for all model factors can be calculated as follows saltelli et al 2008 3 s i v i v v x i e x i r x i v r 4 s ti 1 v x i e x i r x i v r s i s ij s im s ijm s ij k where s i is the fractional contribution of variability in factor i to v independent of other model factors k 1 s ti is the overall contribution of a given model factor i including its interaction with other model factors x i means all factors but x i following the proposed formulations by saltelli et al 2008 we calculated the sobol indices s i and s ti and the interactions among model factors s ti s i the variance based sensitivity indices defined in eqs 3 and 4 can be interpreted as follows a relatively high s i means that factor x i is individually influential on the variability of the rebound index importantly the sum of s i of all factors represents the extent to which all model factors individually influence the rebound index while the remaining one 1 i 1 k s i implies the degree to which the interaction among model factors influences the rebound index variability thus if the sum of the first order indices s i is close to one it can be interpreted that the interaction effects likely play a limited role in the variability of the rebound index and accordingly the model response behaves in an additive manner in other words if the model response is additive then the rebound index variation is the sum of the individual effects of factor variations conversely quantifying a relatively high value of s ti s i means that the interaction of factor i with other model factors is highly influential on the rebound index variability to conduct a time varying variance based gsa on the abad model s rebound index we performed the following procedure step 1 randomly generate n sample points from the feasible ranges of the model factors table 1 step 2 run the abad model n times for the sampled model factors over the study period step 3 calculate the rebound index using eq 1 for every year of the abad model response step 4 estimate the variance based sensitivity indices using eqs 3 and 4 and obtain the time series of s i and s ti step 5 compute s ti s i to represent the interaction of model factor i of any order with every other factor in this study we used a pre specified factor grouping strategy for the time varying variance based gsa table 2 this strategy helps reduce the dimensionality of the factor space to analyze the abad model and reduce the computational cost of the sensitivity analysis saltelli et al 2008 furthermore it has been shown that grouping enabled gsa can provide a better understanding of complex models by identifying dominant influential groups of factors that significantly contribute to the variability in model outputs e g huo et al 2019 sheikholeslami et al 2019 therefore because we intend to use the interpretations of the gsa results to explore the implications for sustainable water management grouping model factors can possibly help policymakers to understand and use these factors to control the agricultural rebound phenomenon in the present study we defined the first group as the economy group which includes all monetary factors for example since the conservation policy factor in the abad model is based on a governmental budget and economic considerations we included this factor in the economy group the risk aversion factor can also be considered in the economy group based on past research e g kulshreshtha and brown 1993 therefore we classified the means of normal distributions corresponding to the past profits future profits risk aversion and conservation policy factors as the economy group as well we specified a heterogeneity group to represent the variability in the farmers decision making regarding different socio economic values if all farmers make a decision in the same manner the value of this group factor becomes zero otherwise the more the farmers behave differently in decision making the higher the heterogeneity group s value becomes therefore standard deviations of all factors were included in the heterogeneity group all other factors i e social interaction environmental protection and irrigation expansion were treated as individual factors for our analysis following ghoreishi et al 2021 we used the feasible parameter ranges of table 1 and the progressive latin hypercube sampling plhs strategy proposed by sheikholeslami and razavi 2017 to draw sample points from those ranges randomly the plhs strategy samples the factor space progressively and as uniformly as possible thereby facilitating the evaluation of the stability and convergence of the gsa at each iteration in this study we generated 10 sub samples with 20 000 points total sample size of 10 20 000 200 000 this multi sampling sequential approach helped us monitor the convergence of the gsa results iteratively at each sub sample and stop the algorithm when the desired level of stability was reached to conduct the variance based gsa we considered the rebound index as the system response in the abad model and we performed the analysis from 2002 to 2015 a period that includes multiple droughts in the brb the rebound index was dynamically calculated using an expanding window with the fixed initial water use w i in 2002 and new water use w n in each year in this study the expected water use w e is assumed to reduce by 30 of the initial water use w i from 2002 to 2015 based on alberta irrigation projects association aipa 2015 4 results fig 2 shows the envelope of the simulated rebound index for the sampled model factors in the brb by the abad model along with the time varying variance based gsa of the rebound index fig 2 a indicates how variability in model factors affects the dynamics of the rebound index from 2002 to 2015 the highly reduced rebound index in wet years e g 2004 and 2010 shows the decreased agricultural water demand compared to 2002 with the adoption of more efficient irrigation technologies in the brb our time varying gsa results show that the economy group most of the time is the most influential group among all other factors or groups of factors affecting the rebound phenomenon in the brb fig 2b furthermore the importance of this group indicates an upward trend over the simulation period meaning that the economy group plays an increasingly important role over time from 2002 to 2015 in the variability of the rebound phenomenon compared to the other factors or groups of factors we argue that the adoption of more efficient irrigation technologies improves the value of water as an economic good for farmers in the brb thus the economic value of water becomes more important with time in farmers decision making on water use the results of the first order effect fig 2b also show that social interaction is a crucial factor in the rebound index however its importance declines over time the downward trend shows that the neighbors conservation actions i e adopting new irrigation systems and changing crop patterns become less important in farmers decision making about water use over time accordingly we attribute this pattern to the fact that when agents adequately learn about adaptation to drought from their neighbors the effect of their interactions decreases over time fig 2b indicates that the environmental protection and the irrigation expansion factors stay at around 10 of the rebound index variability however the contribution of the irrigation expansion factor slightly increases over time which shows that the role of this factor in the rebound index becomes increasingly influential over the long term this finding indicates that the growing contribution of irrigation expansion to the rebound phenomenon is revealed in the long term the heterogeneity group does not show any significant role in the rebound index in the brb fig 2b and thus can be considered as the least influential factor this result shows that farmers in the brb make conservation decisions in the same manner therefore the heterogeneity of farmers decision making does not play a significant role in the rebound phenomenon fig 2c and 2d depict the time varying gsa results for the total order effect sensitivity indices as well as the associated factor ranking in the abad model compared to the results of the first order effect fig 2b the total order effect shows the overall importance of the factors including interactions with all other factors fig 2c shows that the contribution of the factor interactions does not change the overall trend in the results of the gsa for example the economy group remains the most important factor in the rebound phenomenon considering its interactions with other factors over most of the simulation period fig 2d in comparison to fig 2b what is interesting in fig 2c and 2d is a decrease in the ranking of the irrigation expansion factor after including all factor interactions however the contribution of the social interaction factor increases and this factor becomes more important in the rebound index with its parameter interaction fig 2c and 2d compared to its individual effect fig 2b we attribute this increasing role of social interaction to the fact that farmers are willing to learn more about their neighbors when they observe a considerable change in their neighbors benefits therefore given the factor interactions our results indicate that the interaction of some socioeconomic factors can significantly change the perception of their contributions to the rebound phenomenon compared to their individual contributions moreover our results of the time varying gsa fig 2 demonstrate that conducting a gsa experiment based on an arbitrary snapshot of the time independent model response is inadequate for factor prioritization and can contaminate the assessment of the sensitivities ligmann zielinska and sun 2010 for example note how the ranking of socioeconomic factors changes over time in the abad model as can be seen from fig 2d the ranking of the social interaction factor successively switches from one to three over the simulation time this time varying contribution of factors is a challenging issue for most abms due to the lack of adequate tools for the explicit evaluation of the abm dynamics parker et al 2003 richiardi et al 2006 based on the method of variance based gsa saltelli et al 2008 one minus the sum of all first order sensitivity indices 1 i 1 k s i quantifies the extent to which the impact of factors in the abad model behaves in an non additive manner the larger this difference the more interaction the factors exert fig 3 shows the degree of interactions of the abad model factors this result reveals that around 20 of the rebound index variability averaged over time cannot be explained solely by the individual effect of the model factors and that this variability is due to the interactions among the socio economic factors in the abad model to further investigate the nature of the interactions based on the sobol method saltelli et al 2008 fig 4 shows the effect of factor interaction s ti s i on the rebound index the factor interactions of the heterogeneity group and the irrigation expansion factor have limited contribution to the variability of the rebound phenomenon on the other hand the parameter interactions of the economy group environmental protection and the social interaction factors play a major role in the variability of the rebound index the high parameter interaction of the economy group and social interaction suggests that the variability of the rebound index can increase through simultaneous changes on both the profits of irrigation and the social network as an alternative visualization tool we plotted the trajectories of sensitivities for the abad model to better illustrate the relationship between first order and total order effects fig 5 shows the differences between the total order effect and the first order effect as a function of the first order effect over the period 2002 2015 with the squares and circles on each curve representing the years 2002 and 2015 respectively the 1 1 ratio between the parameter interaction and the first order effect indicates that the contribution of the parameter interaction and the first order effect to the total order effect are equal therefore factors with a large contribution of interaction effects would lie toward the top left corner in fig 5 for example the environmental protection factor shows a large interaction effect in the rebound index while the irrigation expansion factor shows only a small effect additionally the social interaction factor shows a time varying interaction effect in the rebound index among all socio economic factors the trajectories of sensitivities for the social interaction factor and the economy group exhibit a large variability as shown in fig 5 this large variability indicates that the magnitude of sensitivity indices i e factor importance for these factors is highly changeable from 2002 to 2015 and thus time varying gsa is highly beneficial for understanding the impact of these factors on the rebound index in addition as shown in fig 5 the trajectories of sensitives for the social interaction factor and the economy group reveal regular patterns over time the first order effect increases for the economy group but decreases for the social interaction factor however there is no clear pattern for trajectories of sensitivities for other factors in particular the heterogeneity and irrigation expansion factors have a very irregular pattern it is also noticeable that the trajectory of sensitivity for the environmental protection factor shows a nearly closed orbit suggesting a somewhat circular pattern this pattern occurs because the environmental protection factor makes the same contribution to the beginning of the simulation period a square in fig 5 and in the final year a circle in fig 5 of the analysis in other words the sensitivity indices in 2015 are approximately equal to the indices in 2002 5 discussion 5 1 are the gsa results consistent with empirical evidence we investigated the literature to support the gsa results mainly from socio economic data and previous studies on the rebound phenomenon as shown in fig 2 we argued that the growing economic value of water improves the economic group s contribution to the rebound phenomenon indeed as farmers adopt efficient irrigation systems they are able to irrigate more profitable crops which are often more water dependent e g specialty crops therefore economic productivity i e gross margin per hectare increases leading to an increasing reliance on irrigation from an economic perspective this issue is considered in the abad model as individual farmers adopt more profitable crops by comparing the economic productivity of forage and that of other crops the observed data in the canadian province of alberta can support our gsa findings and our argument about the economic value of water according to past studies kulshreshtha and brown 1993 kulshreshtha and brown 1994 nicol et al 2008 from individual farmers perspective high tech irrigation systems enable them to obtain higher yields expand their irrigation and switch to higher value crops all of which increase agricultural benefits and might motivate farmers to withdraw more water as well global evidence from the food and agriculture organization fao 2017 suggests that the availability of high tech irrigation systems convinces farmers that irrigation secures higher profits over time thus this perception may result in an increase in water use in the long term this local and global evidence supports the notion that the economy group increases in importance over time the gsa results show that irrigation expansion plays a less significant role in the short term compared to the long term this finding is supported by both empirical evidence berbel et al 2014 food and agriculture organization fao 2017 and theoretical research berbel and mateos 2014 huffaker 2008 pfeiffer and lin 2014 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 indicating that irrigation expansion is more influential in the long term in the agricultural rebound phenomenon in response to improvements in irrigation systems in other words irrigation expansion is a gradual process as farmers want to ensure they have saved enough water to expand their irrigation the gsa results reveal that the individual effect of social interaction in the rebound phenomenon is not as high as that of irrigation expansion which aligns with the findings based on local interviews kulshreshtha and brown 1994 these interviews implied that the contribution of the irrigation expansion is more than that of the farmers neighbors social interaction to the water use however the total effect of social interaction becomes more important than irrigation expansion due to the high factor interactions 5 2 how can the gsa results inspire sustainable water management it is widely accepted that improving irrigation systems has certain benefits the saving of labor the more precise application of chemicals and fertilizers and the potential to switch to higher value crops fao 2017 however this improvement can conflict with sustainable development goals if it gives rise to an increase in water use di baldassarre et al 2019 our gsa results reveal that the economy group is the most important factor in the rebound phenomenon with an increasing role over time crop value has a direct influence on the economic functions of the abad model motivating farmers to switch to high value crops the literature on agricultural rebound has shown that the rebound phenomenon is more likely to happen in areas where high value crops are also more water intensive crops with high tech irrigation systems enabling farmers to make an economic decision to produce these higher value crops berbel et al 2014 food and agriculture organization fao 2017 thus the adoption of water intensive crops will affect the water demand dynamics which may lead to the rebound phenomenon previous studies have indicated that farmers interactions and the associated increase in social capital can be a means to achieve an effective collective action the action taken by a group of people for shared interest to mitigate the rebound phenomenon dessart et al 2019 ferraro et al 2011 effective collective actions could be enhanced by community participation and raising awareness through formal channels to inform an individual farmer of the average water use in their community collective actions can control the rebound phenomenon by enabling farmers to compare their water use with that of their neighbors which may be an effective strategy in reducing water use e g dessart et al 2019 le coent et al 2017 le coent et al 2017 showed that farmers with high water use could be motivated to reduce their water use when they compared their own water use with the average water use of their neighbors additionally our analysis of the abad model identified social interaction as the second most important factor in the abad model the degree to which the farmers network is connected influences the effectiveness of the collective action therefore raising farmers awareness through formal channels will affect this connectedness leading to a change in the dynamics of the rebound phenomenon the literature on the agricultural rebound has shown the important influence of irrigation expansion on the rebound phenomenon berbel and mateos 2014 berbel et al 2014 food and agriculture organization fao 2017 our gsa results also confirm that irrigation expansion increases the rebound phenomenon in the long term jurisdictions often support irrigation expansion because it can result in economic growth for example economic prosperity was a key goal of alberta s water for life program alberta irrigation projects association aipa 2015 however from a sustainable development perspective improving irrigation efficiency along with irrigation expansion in the brb is likely to result in the rebound phenomenon i e the backfire phase in fig 1 as the irrigation expansion is introduced as one cause of the rebound phenomenon in its literature berbel et al 2014 sears et al 2018 to prevent the rebound phenomenon improvements in irrigation systems could be accompanied by restrictions to irrigated areas using the abad model it is possible to determine the effect of irrigation restrictions on the rebound phenomenon as it explicitly simulates the effects of farmers decisions aligning with previous studies berbel and mateos 2014 berbel et al 2014 another strategy to avoid the rebound phenomenon could be to reassign water allocations to reduce farmers water rights marston and cai 2016 as the abad model includes crop yields in the economic functions of individual farmers any reassigned water allocations would affect the dynamics of water use and then the rebound phenomenon it is worth mentioning that such regulatory controls should be carefully monitored as they may raise incentives to infringe the regulations finally what are the implications of the quantified interaction effects for decision makers our results show that a few factors e g irrigation expansion and heterogeneity have a small interaction effect on the variability of the rebound index while other factors e g social interaction have a relatively large interaction effect from the decision makers point of view a model parameter with a large interaction effect should not be individually considered in the decision making process thus such a factor should be comprehensively considered along with the model s other socio economic factors on the other hand factors with small interaction effects can be considered individually by decision makers one at a time for example policymakers could design a strategy related to irrigation expansion e g introduce incentives to limit expansion independently as the interaction effect of this factor has a limited contribution to the rebound index however to control the rebound phenomenon any strategies related to the social interaction factor e g raising farmers awareness through formal channels such as an extension or technical assistance measures should be accompanied by strategies associated with economic factors e g governmental support for irrigating crops with low water requirements as the economic group and the social interaction factor have parameter interactions 6 conclusion the improvement of irrigation systems has been traditionally identified as a means to enhance resilience to drought in agriculture however evidence from across the globe reveals that such improvements may not lead to the expected reduction in water use which may paradoxically even increase a concept known as the rebound phenomenon sustainable water management requires a good understanding of both the co evolutionary dynamics of the coupled human natural systems and the influential socio economic factors in the agricultural rebound phenomenon to achieve this purpose we used a previously developed agent based agricultural water demand abad model which captures the rebound phenomenon in the bow river basin brb alberta canada based on the time varying variance based global sensitivity analysis gsa that we performed on the abad model the main conclusions of this study include the following time varying gsa provides a better understanding of the co evolutionary dynamics of the coupled human natural systems as opposed to most gsa applications on abms which use the time independent final state of the model output the economy group is the most influential factor in the agricultural rebound phenomenon in the brb with an upward trend over time i e increasing importance this study suggests generating new breeds of high value crops with relatively less water need our gsa results revealed that the social interaction factor had a high total effect on the rebound phenomenon in the brb we highlighted the significant role of community participation as a strategy to improve community awareness and avoid the rebound phenomenon considering the high value of parameter interaction for the social interaction factor this study suggests that any strategies related to the social interaction factor should be followed by other strategies associated with the economic group to control the rebound phenomenon in the brb the irrigation expansion factor plays a vital role in the rebound phenomenon in the long term we proposed and discussed how restrictions on irrigated areas and farmers water rights could prevent individual farmers from over using their saved water thus in turn preventing the rebound phenomenon we acknowledge that these interpretations of the results are constrained by the structure assumptions and simplifications of the abad model while the abad model simulates the agricultural water demand dynamics over a relatively short time period the length of this period is comparable to most previous studies on the rebound phenomenon and it captures the years before and after several droughts in a river basin berbel et al 2014 the abad model uses a lumped water submodel which is a limitation of this study despite the limitation the primary findings of this study are broadly consistent with the literature on the rebound phenomenon and water management e g berbel and mateos 2014 berbel et al 2014 food and agriculture organization 2017 this study shows that the time varying variance based gsa analysis

indices varies by changing the number of model evaluations or sample size it is crucial to monitor the stability and convergence of the gsa results to achieve an optimal performance of the gsa analysis we performed the estimation of the sobol indices using progressively increasing numbers of model evaluations from 20 000 to 200 000 sample size fig a1 shows the convergence of the gsa results versus the number of model executions in the year 2010 as an example fig a1 indicates the high stability for the total order effect in the year 2010 over the different number of model executions however the relative importance of rankings become stable after 840 000 model executions fig a1 therefore fig a1 demonstrates that reliable results were achieved with 1 400 000 model executions for our analysis we used the results of the last experiment with 1 400 000 model executions in this study 
4193,modernizing traditional irrigation systems has long been recognized as a means to reduce water losses however empirical evidence shows that this practice may not necessarily reduce water use in the long run in fact in many cases the converse is true a concept known as the rebound phenomenon this phenomenon is at the heart of a fundamental research gap in the explicit evaluation of co evolutionary dynamics and interactions among socio economic and hydrologic factors in agricultural systems this gap calls for the application of systems based methods to evaluate such dynamics to address this gap we use a previously developed agent based agricultural water demand abad model applied to the bow river basin brb in canada we perform a time varying variance based global sensitivity analysis gsa on the abad model to examine the individual effect of factors as well as their joint effect that may give rise to the rebound phenomenon in the brb our results show that economic factors dominantly control possible rebounds although social interaction among farmers is found to be less influential than the irrigation expansion factor its interaction effect with other factors becomes more important indicating the highly interactive nature of the underlying socio hydrological system based on the insights gained via gsa we discuss several strategies including community participation and water restrictions that can be adopted to avoid the rebound phenomenon in irrigation systems this study demonstrates that a time varying variance based gsa can provide a better understanding of the co evolutionary dynamics of the socio hydrological systems and can pave the way for better management of water resources keywords socio hydrology time varying sensitivity analysis agent based modeling agricultural rebound phenomenon bow river basin 1 introduction for many decades switching to efficient irrigation systems e g sprinklers has attracted attention as a management option to make better use of water than traditional irrigation systems however empirical evidence shows that this reduction may motivate farmers to expand irrigated areas which may in turn lead to an increase in water use berbel and mateos 2014 berbel et al 2014 food and agriculture organization fao 2017 in complex coupled human natural systems this concept is known as the rebound phenomenon this phenomenon occurs when increasing technological efficiency counter intuitively leads to an overall increase in water use in the long term a concept first observed in the field of energy as the jevons paradox jevons 1866 the agricultural rebound phenomenon has attracted significant attention with three general types of methods for its assessment analytical models e g gómez and pérez blanco 2014 huffaker 2008 hydro economic models e g dagnino and ward 2012 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 and statistical analyses e g lecina et al 2010 pfeiffer and lin 2014 however little attention has been paid to the feedback loops between the human and hydrological systems which can explain the agricultural rebound phenomenon in understanding this phenomenon socio hydrological models are useful because they focus

agent based model abm applied in the bow river basin brb in canada to examine the agricultural rebound phenomenon their model called the agent based agricultural water demand abad model captures the dynamic behaviors of individual farmers in upgrading on farm irrigation systems and or changing crop patterns the brb is an important sub basin of the saskatchewan river basin saskrb which has faced water security issues in recent years gober and wheater 2014 wheater and gober 2013 according to the literature of jevons paradox in agriculture e g berbel et al 2014 sears et al 2018 when efficient irrigation systems reduce the marginal cost of irrigation and water use a profit maximizing farmer may increase water use mainly by 1 expanding the irrigated area and or 2 switching to high value crops that are also more water intensive the abad model in the brb embeds this mechanism to reproduce the rebound phenomenon ghoreishi et al 2021 in addition compared to the models that demonstrate the agricultural rebound phenomenon based on decisions driven by strictly economic incentives e g gómez and pérez blanco 2014 the abad model adopts an alternative structure in three ways ghoreishi et al 2021 first unlike models that are based on the assumption that humans maximize their benefits or producers maximize profit abad uses a bounded rationality decision structure whereby agents have imperfect knowledge of system relationships and values and are only able to seek satisficing solutions rather than optimal ones epstein 1999 gigerenzer and selten 2001 simon 1955 second most models in the literature have been constructed with economic decision making rules driven by market based price incentives e g gómez and pérez blanco 2014 huffaker 2008 whereas the abad model includes economic and social factors e g social interaction among farmers influencing farmers decision making third as opposed to the conceptual or theoretical nature of many of the available models e g huffaker 2008 the abad model represented an empirical application and was tested in the brb ghoreishi et al 2021 investigated the essential socio economic factors in farmers decision making for water demand as well as the relationship between these factors and water demand dynamics however a major research question was unanswered in that work how can we avoid the agricultural rebound phenomenon socio hydrological modeling of different complex phenomena has advanced our understanding of coupled human natural systems di baldassarre et al 2019 however an explicit evaluation of the co evolutionary dynamics and interactions among socioeconomic factors that would prevent problematic behavior including the agricultural rebound phenomenon is a fundamental research gap this gap calls for the application of systems based methodologies that can attribute the systems scale effect of individual factors and their interaction over the entire factor space in this paper we argue that time varying global sensitivity analysis gsa razavi and gupta 2019 as a powerful method for systems analysis can unravel the extent to which different time varying dimensions of co evolutionary dynamics influence the rebound phenomenon furthermore this method identifies interactions among model factors parameter interaction and can reveal hidden behaviors of models and the underlying systems razavi et al 2021 saltelli et al 2008 sheikholeslami and razavi 2020 the concept of parameter interaction implies that independent factors influence the model response in a non additive manner it is noteworthy that computation and interpretation of the interactions among factors are nontrivial and challenging razavi and gupta 2015 as well although various gsa methods e g derivative based and variance based methods use different philosophies to estimate parameter interactions the variance based method can provide a meaningful global estimation of interactions among model factors considerable literature has been published on the application of gsa to coupled human natural systems with abms e g becu et al 2003 brown and robinson 2006 burke et al 2006 li and liu 2007 ligmann zielinska and sun 2010 schlüter and pahl wostl 2007 most of the previous studies used a time invariant model output or an aggregated model output as a system response for sensitivity analysis an et al 2005 becu et al 2003 schlüter and pahl wostl 2007 these aggregate system responses can lead to a loss of valuable information about the time varying nature of the model behavior and cannot provide comprehensive insight into the co evolutionary dynamics of the underlying system ligmann zielinska and sun 2010 richiardi et al 2006 wagener et al 2001 alternatively a time varying gsa offers detailed information on how variability in model factors affects the dynamics of the model outputs gupta and razavi 2018 ligmann zielinska and sun 2010 razavi and gupta 2019 this type of analysis can deepen the understanding of the co evolutionary dynamics of complex phenomena in water management thus providing insights into future water planning however interpretations of gsa results are constrained by the adopted models which usually represent interactions between human and natural systems simply and imperfectly although this simplicity is essential to model such complex systems elshafei et al 2016 thus findings based on any model should be treated with caution before being generalized to the underlying real world system for sustainable water management the objective of this study is twofold 1 to assess time varying socio economic factors that influence the agricultural rebound phenomenon and 2 to explore ways to avoid the agricultural rebound phenomenon to support sustainable water management for the first objective we perform a time varying gsa on the abad model which can adequately represent the dynamics of agricultural water demand in response to farmers adaptation to drought i e adopting sprinkler irrigation systems and changing crop patterns in the brb this time varying gsa on the abad model provides valuable information about the dynamical nature of the model behavior and comprehensive insights into the co evolutionary dynamics of the underlying system for the second objective we use the results of the time varying gsa and the gained insights to explore strategies to control the agricultural rebound phenomenon with the support of literature 2 rebound phenomenon in agriculture recent studies have demonstrated that the rebound phenomenon can emerge in the context of agricultural water use using empirical evidence pfeiffer and lin 2014 song et al 2018 or theoretical research qureshi et al 2010 scheierling et al 2006 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 agricultural water use comprises 1 beneficial evapotranspiration which improves crop production 2 non beneficial evaporation in which water unnecessarily evaporates from wet bare soil or sprinkler system water 3 non recoverable runoff percolation and 4 recoverable runoff percolation burt et al 1997 both recoverable and non recoverable runoff percolation as well as part of the non beneficial evaporation can be reduced through improvements in irrigation systems in this regard the agricultural rebound phenomenon can be described as follows improving the efficiency of irrigation systems has generally been viewed as a means to reduce water losses as a result farmers adopt more efficient irrigation systems through government subsidies or self financing thus decreasing water use however the saved water may in turn encourage farmers to increase their irrigated area or shift to more water demanding crops which in the long run can increase water use in a river basin two approaches have been used to assess the agricultural rebound phenomenon a few studies have used price elasticity as a proxy to represent the rebound phenomenon as they suggested a close relationship between price elasticity and the dynamics of water demand gómez and gutierrez 2011 song et al 2018 the second method directly compares the agricultural water use before and after shifting to efficient irrigation systems lecina et al 2010 pfeiffer and lin 2014 song et al 2018 1 r w e w n w e w i where r is the agricultural rebound index w e mcm is the expected water use after irrigation efficiency improvement w n mcm is the new water use after irrigation efficiency improvement and w i mcm is the initial water use before irrigation efficiency improvement the agricultural rebound index is calculated over a time window for example considering 2002 as the reference year the agricultural rebound indices in 2006 and 2010 represent water demand dynamics in the periods 2002 2006 and 2002 2010 respectively from eq 1 a rebound r of say 0 3 represents that 30 of the expected water saving is offset by increased water use the denominator in eq 1 is always negative in the sign inspired by the field of energy saunders 2008 five conditions of interest can be realized in eq 1 backfire r 1 the new water use after irrigation efficiency improvement exceeds the initial water use before irrigation efficiency improvement see the empirical evidence by lecina et al 2010 and pfeiffer and lin 2014 full rebound r 1 the new water use after irrigation efficiency improvement equals the initial water use before irrigation efficiency improvement partial rebound 0 r 1 the new water use after irrigation efficiency improvement exceeds the expected water use through irrigation efficiency improvement however the new water use is still less than the initial water use see the empirical evidence by song et al 2018 zero rebound r 0 the new water use after irrigation efficiency improvement equals the expected water use through irrigation efficiency improvement super conservation r 0 the new water use after irrigation efficiency improvement is less than the expected water use through irrigation efficiency improvement see the empirical evidence by lópez gunn et al 2012 fig 1 shows our conceptualization of the rebound phenomenon in agriculture by dividing it into four phases 1 orientation phase 2 ideal phase 3 growth phase and 4 backfire phase in phase 1 governments generally introduce a conservation policy e g technical assistance or financial incentives to adopt more efficient irrigation systems with a specific goal of water savings in phase 2 the agricultural water use almost reaches the pre determined purpose of the program r 0 however this ideal phase can be followed by the growth phase an increase in agricultural water use due to several side effects 0 r 1 this pattern may finally lead to phase4 the backfire phase in which the new water use is even more than the initial water use r 1 3 methodology 3 1 description of the abad model in brb the brb is located in semi arid southern alberta canada while the annual precipitation in the headwaters of this basin ranges from 500 to 700 mm the low land areas of the basin which include the city of calgary has an annual precipitation of 412 mm bow river basin council 2010 around 80 of bow river water is provided by snowmelt from the rocky mountains and the rest of the water source is from rain groundwater and glacial melt bow river basin council 2010 alberta is required to pass 50 of the natural annual flow to downstream based on the master agreement on apportionment prairie provinces water board 1969 in 2010 the agricultural sector accounted for 71 of total water allocation in the brb bow river basin council 2010 as the water source is fully allocated in the brb no new applications for water allocation are accepted alberta queen s printer 2000 the abad model consists of two submodels the monthly water submodel and the yearly human submodel see table a1 for a summary of the main equations variables and factors in the abad model the water submodel of abad is a lumped monthly water demand model which is based on the one developed by the united states department of agriculture 1970 this model accounts for the soil moisture and meteorological data the human submodel simulates the individual farmers as agents 2000 agents based on the brb population these agents make three decisions adopting sprinkler systems changing crops and expanding irrigated areas agents switch from the flood to sprinkler irrigation system to conserve water their second conservation decision is to change from forages to other crops that require less water when agents save water through their water conservation decisions they may expand their irrigated area to benefit from the full amount of their water license table a2 the agents make their decisions based on several socio economic factors conservation policy future profits past profits risk aversion environmental protection social interaction and willingness to expand irrigation ghoreishi et al 2021 the government defines conservation policy according to a given government budget and economic considerations with the case study of brb for example a water conservation target of 30 means that the government plans to reduce the water demand by 30 over a given period with an assumed policy instrument of financial support of the adoption of water efficient irrigation technology the future profits represent the expected gross margin per hectare through conservation in addition to variable costs agents consider the subsidies provided by the government to improve irrigation systems the past profits follow the same idea but it represents the agents memory from their past gross margins risk aversion suggests the degree to which farmers deviate from their past decisions on water conservation environmental protection shows the extent to which agents conserve water in favor of the environment social interaction indicates the degree to which farmers decisions are affected by their neighbors a willingness to expand irrigation suggests the degree to which an agent uses the saved water to expand irrigation to make yearly decisions agents use different weights for socio economic factors the weights show the relative importance of each factor for the agents conservation decisions in the abad model these weights are sampled from specified probability distributions i e normal distributions which represent the heterogeneity in a farming society in terms of farmers decision making processes following ghoreishi et al 2021 we used the ranges of the abad model factors shown in table 1 this table shows the lower and upper bounds of means and standard deviations of the normal distributions corresponding to the specified socio economic factors the upper bound of the mean for yearly conservation goal μ c is assigned based on the target in the water for life program i e 2 of the total irrigated area was targeted to be under the water conservation program on average each year alberta irrigation projects association 2015 the mean for irrigation expansion is based on the historical data while individual farmers can expand their irrigation above or below the historical records besides a large boundary for standard deviations is defined to test the abad model s performance ghoreishi et al 2021 used a multi objective approach for the calibration and validation process the abad model was calibrated on two of its three outputs i e water demand and irrigation system area and validated on the other output i e cropping patterns ghoreishi et al 2021 indicated that the abad model showed a good model performance in simulating agricultural water demand in the brb thus this model is a good candidate for further analysis of the water demand dynamics and the brb rebound phenomenon 3 2 time varying variance based gsa to improve the understanding of the co evolutionary dynamics of the rebound phenomenon we conducted a time varying variance based gsa on the abad model s rebound index r while identifying the most influential model factors over time we investigated the extent to which the interactions among the socio economic factors are important in giving rise to the variability of the model response the variance based method is capable of exploring the interactions among model factors saltelli et al 2008 for k model factors the variance of the rebound index v can be decomposed by the following variance decomposition formula gómez delgado and tarantola 2006 saisana et al 2005 2 v i v i i j v ij i j m v ijm v 12 k where v i represents the portion of the rebound index variance that can be explained by varying an individual factor x i on the other hand v ij denotes the portion of the rebound index variance explained by the interaction between x i and x j and so on for higher order interactions v ijm using the aforementioned variance decomposition the first order main effect si and total effect interaction effect sti indices sobol indices for all model factors can be calculated as follows saltelli et al 2008 3 s i v i v v x i e x i r x i v r 4 s ti 1 v x i e x i r x i v r s i s ij s im s ijm s ij k where s i is the fractional contribution of variability in factor i to v independent of other model factors k 1 s ti is the overall contribution of a given model factor i including its interaction with other model factors x i means all factors but x i following the proposed formulations by saltelli et al 2008 we calculated the sobol indices s i and s ti and the interactions among model factors s ti s i the variance based sensitivity indices defined in eqs 3 and 4 can be interpreted as follows a relatively high s i means that factor x i is individually influential on the variability of the rebound index importantly the sum of s i of all factors represents the extent to which all model factors individually influence the rebound index while the remaining one 1 i 1 k s i implies the degree to which the interaction among model factors influences the rebound index variability thus if the sum of the first order indices s i is close to one it can be interpreted that the interaction effects likely play a limited role in the variability of the rebound index and accordingly the model response behaves in an additive manner in other words if the model response is additive then the rebound index variation is the sum of the individual effects of factor variations conversely quantifying a relatively high value of s ti s i means that the interaction of factor i with other model factors is highly influential on the rebound index variability to conduct a time varying variance based gsa on the abad model s rebound index we performed the following procedure step 1 randomly generate n sample points from the feasible ranges of the model factors table 1 step 2 run the abad model n times for the sampled model factors over the study period step 3 calculate the rebound index using eq 1 for every year of the abad model response step 4 estimate the variance based sensitivity indices using eqs 3 and 4 and obtain the time series of s i and s ti step 5 compute s ti s i to represent the interaction of model factor i of any order with every other factor in this study we used a pre specified factor grouping strategy for the time varying variance based gsa table 2 this strategy helps reduce the dimensionality of the factor space to analyze the abad model and reduce the computational cost of the sensitivity analysis saltelli et al 2008 furthermore it has been shown that grouping enabled gsa can provide a better understanding of complex models by identifying dominant influential groups of factors that significantly contribute to the variability in model outputs e g huo et al 2019 sheikholeslami et al 2019 therefore because we intend to use the interpretations of the gsa results to explore the implications for sustainable water management grouping model factors can possibly help policymakers to understand and use these factors to control the agricultural rebound phenomenon in the present study we defined the first group as the economy group which includes all monetary factors for example since the conservation policy factor in the abad model is based on a governmental budget and economic considerations we included this factor in the economy group the risk aversion factor can also be considered in the economy group based on past research e g kulshreshtha and brown 1993 therefore we classified the means of normal distributions corresponding to the past profits future profits risk aversion and conservation policy factors as the economy group as well we specified a heterogeneity group to represent the variability in the farmers decision making regarding different socio economic values if all farmers make a decision in the same manner the value of this group factor becomes zero otherwise the more the farmers behave differently in decision making the higher the heterogeneity group s value becomes therefore standard deviations of all factors were included in the heterogeneity group all other factors i e social interaction environmental protection and irrigation expansion were treated as individual factors for our analysis following ghoreishi et al 2021 we used the feasible parameter ranges of table 1 and the progressive latin hypercube sampling plhs strategy proposed by sheikholeslami and razavi 2017 to draw sample points from those ranges randomly the plhs strategy samples the factor space progressively and as uniformly as possible thereby facilitating the evaluation of the stability and convergence of the gsa at each iteration in this study we generated 10 sub samples with 20 000 points total sample size of 10 20 000 200 000 this multi sampling sequential approach helped us monitor the convergence of the gsa results iteratively at each sub sample and stop the algorithm when the desired level of stability was reached to conduct the variance based gsa we considered the rebound index as the system response in the abad model and we performed the analysis from 2002 to 2015 a period that includes multiple droughts in the brb the rebound index was dynamically calculated using an expanding window with the fixed initial water use w i in 2002 and new water use w n in each year in this study the expected water use w e is assumed to reduce by 30 of the initial water use w i from 2002 to 2015 based on alberta irrigation projects association aipa 2015 4 results fig 2 shows the envelope of the simulated rebound index for the sampled model factors in the brb by the abad model along with the time varying variance based gsa of the rebound index fig 2 a indicates how variability in model factors affects the dynamics of the rebound index from 2002 to 2015 the highly reduced rebound index in wet years e g 2004 and 2010 shows the decreased agricultural water demand compared to 2002 with the adoption of more efficient irrigation technologies in the brb our time varying gsa results show that the economy group most of the time is the most influential group among all other factors or groups of factors affecting the rebound phenomenon in the brb fig 2b furthermore the importance of this group indicates an upward trend over the simulation period meaning that the economy group plays an increasingly important role over time from 2002 to 2015 in the variability of the rebound phenomenon compared to the other factors or groups of factors we argue that the adoption of more efficient irrigation technologies improves the value of water as an economic good for farmers in the brb thus the economic value of water becomes more important with time in farmers decision making on water use the results of the first order effect fig 2b also show that social interaction is a crucial factor in the rebound index however its importance declines over time the downward trend shows that the neighbors conservation actions i e adopting new irrigation systems and changing crop patterns become less important in farmers decision making about water use over time accordingly we attribute this pattern to the fact that when agents adequately learn about adaptation to drought from their neighbors the effect of their interactions decreases over time fig 2b indicates that the environmental protection and the irrigation expansion factors stay at around 10 of the rebound index variability however the contribution of the irrigation expansion factor slightly increases over time which shows that the role of this factor in the rebound index becomes increasingly influential over the long term this finding indicates that the growing contribution of irrigation expansion to the rebound phenomenon is revealed in the long term the heterogeneity group does not show any significant role in the rebound index in the brb fig 2b and thus can be considered as the least influential factor this result shows that farmers in the brb make conservation decisions in the same manner therefore the heterogeneity of farmers decision making does not play a significant role in the rebound phenomenon fig 2c and 2d depict the time varying gsa results for the total order effect sensitivity indices as well as the associated factor ranking in the abad model compared to the results of the first order effect fig 2b the total order effect shows the overall importance of the factors including interactions with all other factors fig 2c shows that the contribution of the factor interactions does not change the overall trend in the results of the gsa for example the economy group remains the most important factor in the rebound phenomenon considering its interactions with other factors over most of the simulation period fig 2d in comparison to fig 2b what is interesting in fig 2c and 2d is a decrease in the ranking of the irrigation expansion factor after including all factor interactions however the contribution of the social interaction factor increases and this factor becomes more important in the rebound index with its parameter interaction fig 2c and 2d compared to its individual effect fig 2b we attribute this increasing role of social interaction to the fact that farmers are willing to learn more about their neighbors when they observe a considerable change in their neighbors benefits therefore given the factor interactions our results indicate that the interaction of some socioeconomic factors can significantly change the perception of their contributions to the rebound phenomenon compared to their individual contributions moreover our results of the time varying gsa fig 2 demonstrate that conducting a gsa experiment based on an arbitrary snapshot of the time independent model response is inadequate for factor prioritization and can contaminate the assessment of the sensitivities ligmann zielinska and sun 2010 for example note how the ranking of socioeconomic factors changes over time in the abad model as can be seen from fig 2d the ranking of the social interaction factor successively switches from one to three over the simulation time this time varying contribution of factors is a challenging issue for most abms due to the lack of adequate tools for the explicit evaluation of the abm dynamics parker et al 2003 richiardi et al 2006 based on the method of variance based gsa saltelli et al 2008 one minus the sum of all first order sensitivity indices 1 i 1 k s i quantifies the extent to which the impact of factors in the abad model behaves in an non additive manner the larger this difference the more interaction the factors exert fig 3 shows the degree of interactions of the abad model factors this result reveals that around 20 of the rebound index variability averaged over time cannot be explained solely by the individual effect of the model factors and that this variability is due to the interactions among the socio economic factors in the abad model to further investigate the nature of the interactions based on the sobol method saltelli et al 2008 fig 4 shows the effect of factor interaction s ti s i on the rebound index the factor interactions of the heterogeneity group and the irrigation expansion factor have limited contribution to the variability of the rebound phenomenon on the other hand the parameter interactions of the economy group environmental protection and the social interaction factors play a major role in the variability of the rebound index the high parameter interaction of the economy group and social interaction suggests that the variability of the rebound index can increase through simultaneous changes on both the profits of irrigation and the social network as an alternative visualization tool we plotted the trajectories of sensitivities for the abad model to better illustrate the relationship between first order and total order effects fig 5 shows the differences between the total order effect and the first order effect as a function of the first order effect over the period 2002 2015 with the squares and circles on each curve representing the years 2002 and 2015 respectively the 1 1 ratio between the parameter interaction and the first order effect indicates that the contribution of the parameter interaction and the first order effect to the total order effect are equal therefore factors with a large contribution of interaction effects would lie toward the top left corner in fig 5 for example the environmental protection factor shows a large interaction effect in the rebound index while the irrigation expansion factor shows only a small effect additionally the social interaction factor shows a time varying interaction effect in the rebound index among all socio economic factors the trajectories of sensitivities for the social interaction factor and the economy group exhibit a large variability as shown in fig 5 this large variability indicates that the magnitude of sensitivity indices i e factor importance for these factors is highly changeable from 2002 to 2015 and thus time varying gsa is highly beneficial for understanding the impact of these factors on the rebound index in addition as shown in fig 5 the trajectories of sensitives for the social interaction factor and the economy group reveal regular patterns over time the first order effect increases for the economy group but decreases for the social interaction factor however there is no clear pattern for trajectories of sensitivities for other factors in particular the heterogeneity and irrigation expansion factors have a very irregular pattern it is also noticeable that the trajectory of sensitivity for the environmental protection factor shows a nearly closed orbit suggesting a somewhat circular pattern this pattern occurs because the environmental protection factor makes the same contribution to the beginning of the simulation period a square in fig 5 and in the final year a circle in fig 5 of the analysis in other words the sensitivity indices in 2015 are approximately equal to the indices in 2002 5 discussion 5 1 are the gsa results consistent with empirical evidence we investigated the literature to support the gsa results mainly from socio economic data and previous studies on the rebound phenomenon as shown in fig 2 we argued that the growing economic value of water improves the economic group s contribution to the rebound phenomenon indeed as farmers adopt efficient irrigation systems they are able to irrigate more profitable crops which are often more water dependent e g specialty crops therefore economic productivity i e gross margin per hectare increases leading to an increasing reliance on irrigation from an economic perspective this issue is considered in the abad model as individual farmers adopt more profitable crops by comparing the economic productivity of forage and that of other crops the observed data in the canadian province of alberta can support our gsa findings and our argument about the economic value of water according to past studies kulshreshtha and brown 1993 kulshreshtha and brown 1994 nicol et al 2008 from individual farmers perspective high tech irrigation systems enable them to obtain higher yields expand their irrigation and switch to higher value crops all of which increase agricultural benefits and might motivate farmers to withdraw more water as well global evidence from the food and agriculture organization fao 2017 suggests that the availability of high tech irrigation systems convinces farmers that irrigation secures higher profits over time thus this perception may result in an increase in water use in the long term this local and global evidence supports the notion that the economy group increases in importance over time the gsa results show that irrigation expansion plays a less significant role in the short term compared to the long term this finding is supported by both empirical evidence berbel et al 2014 food and agriculture organization fao 2017 and theoretical research berbel and mateos 2014 huffaker 2008 pfeiffer and lin 2014 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 indicating that irrigation expansion is more influential in the long term in the agricultural rebound phenomenon in response to improvements in irrigation systems in other words irrigation expansion is a gradual process as farmers want to ensure they have saved enough water to expand their irrigation the gsa results reveal that the individual effect of social interaction in the rebound phenomenon is not as high as that of irrigation expansion which aligns with the findings based on local interviews kulshreshtha and brown 1994 these interviews implied that the contribution of the irrigation expansion is more than that of the farmers neighbors social interaction to the water use however the total effect of social interaction becomes more important than irrigation expansion due to the high factor interactions 5 2 how can the gsa results inspire sustainable water management it is widely accepted that improving irrigation systems has certain benefits the saving of labor the more precise application of chemicals and fertilizers and the potential to switch to higher value crops fao 2017 however this improvement can conflict with sustainable development goals if it gives rise to an increase in water use di baldassarre et al 2019 our gsa results reveal that the economy group is the most important factor in the rebound phenomenon with an increasing role over time crop value has a direct influence on the economic functions of the abad model motivating farmers to switch to high value crops the literature on agricultural rebound has shown that the rebound phenomenon is more likely to happen in areas where high value crops are also more water intensive crops with high tech irrigation systems enabling farmers to make an economic decision to produce these higher value crops berbel et al 2014 food and agriculture organization fao 2017 thus the adoption of water intensive crops will affect the water demand dynamics which may lead to the rebound phenomenon previous studies have indicated that farmers interactions and the associated increase in social capital can be a means to achieve an effective collective action the action taken by a group of people for shared interest to mitigate the rebound phenomenon dessart et al 2019 ferraro et al 2011 effective collective actions could be enhanced by community participation and raising awareness through formal channels to inform an individual farmer of the average water use in their community collective actions can control the rebound phenomenon by enabling farmers to compare their water use with that of their neighbors which may be an effective strategy in reducing water use e g dessart et al 2019 le coent et al 2017 le coent et al 2017 showed that farmers with high water use could be motivated to reduce their water use when they compared their own water use with the average water use of their neighbors additionally our analysis of the abad model identified social interaction as the second most important factor in the abad model the degree to which the farmers network is connected influences the effectiveness of the collective action therefore raising farmers awareness through formal channels will affect this connectedness leading to a change in the dynamics of the rebound phenomenon the literature on the agricultural rebound has shown the important influence of irrigation expansion on the rebound phenomenon berbel and mateos 2014 berbel et al 2014 food and agriculture organization fao 2017 our gsa results also confirm that irrigation expansion increases the rebound phenomenon in the long term jurisdictions often support irrigation expansion because it can result in economic growth for example economic prosperity was a key goal of alberta s water for life program alberta irrigation projects association aipa 2015 however from a sustainable development perspective improving irrigation efficiency along with irrigation expansion in the brb is likely to result in the rebound phenomenon i e the backfire phase in fig 1 as the irrigation expansion is introduced as one cause of the rebound phenomenon in its literature berbel et al 2014 sears et al 2018 to prevent the rebound phenomenon improvements in irrigation systems could be accompanied by restrictions to irrigated areas using the abad model it is possible to determine the effect of irrigation restrictions on the rebound phenomenon as it explicitly simulates the effects of farmers decisions aligning with previous studies berbel and mateos 2014 berbel et al 2014 another strategy to avoid the rebound phenomenon could be to reassign water allocations to reduce farmers water rights marston and cai 2016 as the abad model includes crop yields in the economic functions of individual farmers any reassigned water allocations would affect the dynamics of water use and then the rebound phenomenon it is worth mentioning that such regulatory controls should be carefully monitored as they may raise incentives to infringe the regulations finally what are the implications of the quantified interaction effects for decision makers our results show that a few factors e g irrigation expansion and heterogeneity have a small interaction effect on the variability of the rebound index while other factors e g social interaction have a relatively large interaction effect from the decision makers point of view a model parameter with a large interaction effect should not be individually considered in the decision making process thus such a factor should be comprehensively considered along with the model s other socio economic factors on the other hand factors with small interaction effects can be considered individually by decision makers one at a time for example policymakers could design a strategy related to irrigation expansion e g introduce incentives to limit expansion independently as the interaction effect of this factor has a limited contribution to the rebound index however to control the rebound phenomenon any strategies related to the social interaction factor e g raising farmers awareness through formal channels such as an extension or technical assistance measures should be accompanied by strategies associated with economic factors e g governmental support for irrigating crops with low water requirements as the economic group and the social interaction factor have parameter interactions 6 conclusion the improvement of irrigation systems has been traditionally identified as a means to enhance resilience to drought in agriculture however evidence from across the globe reveals that such improvements may not lead to the expected reduction in water use which may paradoxically even increase a concept known as the rebound phenomenon sustainable water management requires a good understanding of both the co evolutionary dynamics of the coupled human natural systems and the influential socio economic factors in the agricultural rebound phenomenon to achieve this purpose we used a previously developed agent based agricultural water demand abad model which captures the rebound phenomenon in the bow river basin brb alberta canada based on the time varying variance based global sensitivity analysis gsa that we performed on the abad model the main conclusions of this study include the following time varying gsa provides a better understanding of the co evolutionary dynamics of the coupled human natural systems as opposed to most gsa applications on abms which use the time independent final state of the model output the economy group is the most influential factor in the agricultural rebound phenomenon in the brb with an upward trend over time i e increasing importance this study suggests generating new breeds of high value crops with relatively less water need our gsa results revealed that the social interaction factor had a high total effect on the rebound phenomenon in the brb we highlighted the significant role of community participation as a strategy to improve community awareness and avoid the rebound phenomenon considering the high value of parameter interaction for the social interaction factor this study suggests that any strategies related to the social interaction factor should be followed by other strategies associated with the economic group to control the rebound phenomenon in the brb the irrigation expansion factor plays a vital role in the rebound phenomenon in the long term we proposed and discussed how restrictions on irrigated areas and farmers water rights could prevent individual farmers from over using their saved water thus in turn preventing the rebound phenomenon we acknowledge that these interpretations of the results are constrained by the structure assumptions and simplifications of the abad model while the abad model simulates the agricultural water demand dynamics over a relatively short time period the length of this period is comparable to most previous studies on the rebound phenomenon and it captures the years before and after several droughts in a river basin berbel et al 2014 the abad model uses a lumped water submodel which is a limitation of this study despite the limitation the primary findings of this study are broadly consistent with the literature on the rebound phenomenon and water management e g berbel and mateos 2014 berbel et al 2014 food and agriculture organization 2017 this study shows that the time varying variance based gsa analysis can pave the way for developing a method that explicitly evaluates co evolutionary dynamics in a socio hydrological model for better management of water resources 7 credit author statement mohammad

4194,increases in the magnitude of storm and flood related catastrophes due to climate change are predicted to increase associated economic losses there exists however conflicting evidence for greater economic losses despite well acknowledged increases in the severity of observed extreme events in recent decades here using a worldwide catastrophe insurance database from 1970 to 2015 we link the catastrophe economic loss from extreme storms and floods to local temperature we find a statistically significant positive association between economic losses expressed as a proportion of gdp and local temperature the association between economic losses and temperature is greater as the event becomes more extreme with the signal muted for flooding as compared to storms although local associations of economic loss with temperature cannot be directly linked to rising global temperatures as a result of climate change the positive economic loss temperature associations are consistent with observed extreme precipitation temperature associations and hence pertinent to the advancement of understanding future natural catastrophes keywords extreme precipitation flood temperature climate change catastrophe economic loss 1 introduction storm related climate catastrophes result in major loss of life and widespread economic damage with developing countries particularly exposed as they lack the financial and material resources to mitigate impacts razavi et al 2020 overall the economic losses from these catastrophes are expected to be exacerbated by climatic change arent et al 2014 ipcc 2012 this expectation is supported by evidence from dynamic downscaling of individual weather events and statistical downscaling of global climate models both of which predict increased insurance losses can be expected as we head into the significantly warmer temperatures over the rest of this century held et al 2013 the contribution of climate change to economic loss potential from storm events is largely based on the assumption of increasing storm intensity driven via the clausius clapeyron relation assuming constant relative humidity this physical relationship dictates that as temperatures increase so does the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere and hence extreme precipitation intensity should increase as a result trenberth 2011 trenberth et al 2003 this in turn is predicted to lead to increased flood risk trenberth et al 2003 westra et al 2014 particularly in urban settings fadhel et al 2018 hettiarachchi et al 2018 miller and hutchins 2017 increases in precipitation intensity are likely to be coupled with changes in storm temporal pattern wasko and sharma 2015 as well as duration emmanuel et al 2012 webster 2005 and areal extent prein et al 2017 storms may also invigorate due to increased latent heat release at higher absolute humidity intensifying upward motions lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 trenberth et al 2003 or change due to larger atmospheric changes such at the expansion of the hadley cell grise et al 2018 mathew and kumar 2019 seidel et al 2008 staten et al 2018 increasing the frequency of extreme precipitation events myhre et al 2019 all these factors are predicted to lead to increased storm severity with climate change seneviratne et al 2012 observed increases in extreme precipitation flooding and storm severity are abound in literature do et al 2017 donat et al 2013 emanuel 2005 martinez villalobos and neelin 2018 o gorman 2015 slater et al 2021 sun et al 2021 wasko and nathan 2019 westra et al 2013a while historical changes in climate extremes have been attributed to anthropogenic climate change diffenbaugh et al 2017 kay et al 2011 min et al 2011 pall et al 2011 the linking of economic losses to climatic change is more difficult bouwer 2011 hoeppe 2016 changes in economic losses have been associated with local climate variability pielke and landsea 1999 welker and faust 2013 and the economic cost of hurricane harvey has recently been attributed to climate change frame et al 2020 but debate remains on whether temporal trends in economic loss exist paprotny et al 2018 although a summary of historical studies finds more studies observe increases rather than decreases in economic loss bouwer 2011 after appropriate normalisation for increases in economic growth studies generally find little temporal trend and hence association with climate change arent et al 2014 for example normalised total annual losses from hurricanes in the united states pielke et al 2008 weinkle et al 2018 and latin america and the caribbean pielke et al 2003 show no temporal trend likewise no climate change signal was identified in normalised annual aggregations of flood losses across europe barredo 2009 global normalised economic loss aggregations across various natural disaster types also display no statistically significant upward trend barthel and neumayer 2012 neumayer and barthel 2011 with continental australian studies showing similar results crompton and mcaneney 2008 mcaneney et al 2019 as global temperatures have been monotonically increasing and can be substituted for a temporal trend there is likewise no link found between increasing global temperatures and increasing global economic losses miller et al 2008 the two primary arguments for differing trends in economic loss are the method of normalisation of economic loss barthel and neumayer 2012 kron et al 2019 and the absence of consideration of changes in vulnerability mechler and bouwer 2015 for example climate change signals may be obscured by increasing defences and resilience to climatic catastrophes nicholls 2011 meaning increases in economic loss are not as large as they would have been had vulnerability reducing measures not been implemented mechler and bouwer 2015 here we suggest another possibility as global warming does not always affect the global temperature uniformly neukom et al 2019 it may be that higher global temperatures will not be associated with greater economic losses but local temperatures will there is significant evidence that local temperature influences storm severity lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 peleg et al 2018 changes in both tropical cyclones and local scale convective events have been correlated to increases in temperature lenderink and attema 2015 webster 2005 increased lightning strikes have been linked to higher temperatures molnar et al 2015 and a greater number of insurance claims mills 2005 indeed local temperature sensitivities have been shown to be the primary variable explaining rainfall variability across various temporal scales wasko and sharma 2017a westra et al 2013b with higher temperatures linked to greater flood event magnitude wasko and sharma 2017b local temperature increases have been successfully used as a predictor in non stationary analysis of flood risk condon et al 2015 towler et al 2010 and extreme rainfall agilan and umamahesh 2015 mondal and mujumdar 2015 even being linked to indicators of water quality guo et al 2021 and hence health outcomes jhajharia et al 2013 as discussed above storm extremes are linked to higher temperatures from the increased moisture carrying capacity of a warmer atmosphere as specified by the clausius clapeyron relationship roderick et al 2019 trenberth 2011 assuming constant relative humidity this increase in moisture carrying capacity can lead to larger downpours especially over short periods of time where local moisture contributes substantially fowler et al 2021 while this physical link to temperature becomes weaker when the relationship is extended to other derived variables such as floods sharma et al 2018 tramblay et al 2019 wasko 2021 and economic loss nicholls 2011 a positive link with extreme precipitation is well established hence here we seek to investigate can a link between temperature and the economic loss resulting from extreme hydrologic and meteorological events be identified we analyse natural disasters on a per event basis rather than a total or annual economic loss to capture the event severity in terms of economic loss the normalised temporal trend on a per catastrophe basis is first analysed to see if economic losses have increased due to an increase in event severity next because global temperature anomalies are not necessarily spatially uniform the sensitivity of normalised economic loss to local temperature as a driver of storm intensification is investigated the influence of storm severity and the originating storm mechanism on the relationship of normalised economic loss to local temperature are also investigated finally the implications in the context of climate change are discussed 2 data in this study we use the sigma catastrophe database for the years 1970 to 2015 swissre 2016 sigma represents a comprehensive database of significant catastrophe events collated from newspapers direct and reinsurance periodicals specialist publications and reports from re insurers this data set provides information on 5024 natural catastrophes for which various statistics are reported including fatalities economic loss and insured loss here we focus on the economic loss the economic loss consists of both infrastructure damage stock losses and lost production due to economic interruption flow losses the total economic loss is reported as a nominal loss in the local currency the local loss in u s dollars and the inflated loss in 2016 u s dollars the nominal economic loss is converted to u s dollars using the end of year exchange rate and subsequently the u s dollar value is adjusted for inflation using the us consumer price index to give economic loss for the base year 2016 consistent with insurance industry practice catastrophes are classified on the type of catastrophe using peril terminology these perils are storms floods hail heat related catastrophes such as droughts and fires cold related catastrophes such blizzards earthquakes or unclassified storm damages generally stem from events causing water ingress or wind driven rain damage whereas flood events are generally from riverine inundation such as over topping of riverbanks perils originating from blizzards can be classified as either cold related catastrophes or storms depending on the primary peril a description of each event is also given providing the storm mechanism for example the haiyan typhoon of 2013 in the philippines is classified as a storm and described as haiyan typhoon such data sets provide a quantitative link between the hydrologic sciences and economic loss gao et al 2019 here we focus on the hydrologic storm related catastrophes that is storms floods and hail events a total of 1985 events the location of each catastrophe is reported as a region state territory or country for this study the location description was mapped to geographical coordinates using an application programming interface the location and economic loss of each catastrophe is presented in fig 1 a economic loss is highly non linear with the largest 50 of events responsible for 97 of losses and the largest 10 responsible for 75 of losses after normalisation section 3 1 the automated matching of each catastrophe event to a set of coordinates was verified manually the proportion of catastrophes classified as either storms or floods far exceeds those classified as hail fig 1b the number of recorded events has increased in time fig 1c with few recorded events prior to 1985 for countries with more than 20 recorded catastrophes the number of catastrophes is summarised in fig 1d most recorded events are in the unites states europe and china fig 1a 1d 3 methods 3 1 normalisation of individual catastrophes we analyse economic loss on a per catastrophe basis to isolate possible increases in storm severity the effect of normalisation on economic loss is discussed in detail in neumayer and barthel 2011 for spatial pooling for a given catastrophe year t normalising by the country wealth is recommended neumayer and barthel 2011 1 y i normalisedeconomicloss i economicloss i t wealth t this results in a sample of normalised economic loss yi where i 1 n and n is the total number of events as presented in fig 1a as long as the wealth is for the same year as the economic loss the result is a dimensionless ratio of the actual loss to the potential loss aplr which can then be pooled spatially neumayer and barthel 2011 as discussed economic loss consists of both losses to physical infrastructure stock and losses related to economic disruption flow to accurately normalise a measure of wealth is required a simplification is to use gdp as a wealth measure although gdp is a flow measure it is typically highly correlated with wealth stock neumayer and barthel 2011 resulting in consistent normalisations paprotny et al 2018 here the nominal gross domestic product in u s dollars un 2017 is used as an indicator of wealth consistent with standard practice munich 2016 and previous studies neumayer and barthel 2011 pielke and landsea 1999 welker and faust 2013 twelve catastrophes with a normalised economic loss aplr above 0 4 were removed these catastrophes were for small nations where the normalised economic loss is improbably high neumayer and barthel 2011 removal of these data points did not affect the results presented 3 2 analysis of temporal trend for temporal analysis the total normalised economic loss for each calendar year is divided by the number of catastrophes recorded to find the average normalised economic loss per catastrophe per year the temporal trend of normalised economic loss per catastrophe per year was assessed using the non parametric rank based kendall s tau correlation kendall 1975 1938 kendall s tau is a rank based non parametric correlation measure which equals 1 if all pairs are concordant and 1 if all pairs are discordant equation 2 2 τ n c n d n n 1 2 where n c and n d are the number of concordant discordant pairs respectively and n is the number of observations in this case years the temporal trend was calculated with a varying start and end year ensuring that the minimum record length considered was 10 years this allowed consideration of change points or bias due to an individual year or short period having a high normalised economic loss due to the possibility of serial autocorrelation it is prudent to use multiple trend tests zamani et al 2017 the analysis was repeated using a modified mann kendall test with bias corrected pre whitening to remove the effect of any serial correlation hamed 2009 as the results were consistent with those based on kendall s tau the results presented here focus on the use of kendall s tau 3 3 analysis of temperature associations the clausius clapeyron equation describes how the equilibrium vapour pressure es varies with temperature t 3 e s t e s l v t r v t 2 where l v is the latent heat of vapourisation and r v is the gas constant as temperature increases the saturation vapour pressure increases exponentially translating to an increase between 5 7 and 6 7 c in the range 10 30 c wasko 2021 hence the intensity and severity of an extreme storm event can be linked to local temperature agilan and umamahesh 2017 fowler et al 2021 lenderink and attema 2015 here each standardised catastrophe event was matched to the local ncep ncar reanalysis1 monthly temperature on a 2 5 grid kalnay et al 1996 ncep 1994 based on the start time of the catastrophe monthly temperature was used as it has been shown be an effective predictor for non stationary flood risk condon et al 2015 towler et al 2010 and extreme rainfall intensities agilan and umamahesh 2015 cross et al 2020 wasko and sharma 2017a the analysis was also performed using an observed 1 0 gridded dataset rohde et al 2013 berkeley earth 2015 with the results found to be almost identical all the standardised catastrophe events equation 1 with their matched local temperature were pooled and their sensitivity association to temperature was investigated using quantile regression koenker and bassett 1978 wasko and sharma 2014 quantile regression was implemented in the statistical software r using the package quantreg koenker 2021 quantile regression allows the response with differing event rarity to be investigated and is less biased to outlying data here a quantile regression is fitted to the logarithm of economic loss quantile regression is similar to linear regression and is expressed as per equation 4 but a cost function d is used to minimize deviation from the quantile q of interest equation 5 that is for a regression of the form where yi is the normalised economic loss for each catastrophe and ti is the local monthly temperature 4 l o g y i β 0 q β 1 q t i the regression coefficients β 0 q and β 1 q are chosen to minimize a cost function d defined as 5 d β 0 q β 1 q q y i β 0 q β 1 q t i y i β 0 q β 1 q t i 1 q y i β 0 q β 1 q t i y i β 0 q β 1 q t i for example to regress for the 99th percentile q is set equal to 0 99 and substituted into equation 5 to calculate the regression coefficients β 0 0 99 and β 1 0 99 this substitution results in a large weight for the first summation term points above the regression line and a small weight for the second summation term points below the regression line resulting in regression coefficients being optimised to minimise the absolute difference of fitted values close to the first summation term that is the fitted regression line to the 99th percentile of all the data the sensitivity of the normalised economic loss y as a percentage change per degree in temperature is then calculated by 6 δ y 100 10 β 1 1 as china and the u s account for almost 40 of our catastrophe sample fig 1d and have the two largest global gross domestic products the catastrophe data is split between these two countries and those remaining to prevent possible bias due to the uneven sample of events between countries individual quantiles were calculated using a 2 c moving temperature window to confirm the assumption of linearity between the logarithm of normalised economic loss and temperature to analyse the possible impact of storm mechanism each event description was mined for key words these were tornado thunderstorm hurricane typhoon and cyclone tropical storm descriptions without these key words were classified as other storms and include storms described as winter storms as well as storms without any additional description the temperature range used for regression to remove the influence of outliers is indicated in each figure by the extents of the fitted regression 4 results 4 1 temporal trend a time series of the normalised economic loss per catastrophe per year is presented in fig 2 a for simplicity from here on economic loss refers to the economic loss standardised by gdp a surface of kendall s tau statistic for monotonic trend is presented in fig 2b statistical significance is presented in fig 2c the trend test is performed on a moving window of years with a minimum of 10 years required for testing economic loss per catastrophe is seen to increase only if the data pre 1980 is included but there is minimal catastrophe data recorded before 1985 fig 1c when data pre 1980 is omitted no statistically significant trends are obtained these results are consistent with previous global studies that used annual aggregations rather than the per event analysis performed here that concluded there is little evidence for a temporal increase in catastrophe related economic loss miller et al 2008 neumayer and barthel 2011 4 2 sensitivity to temperature the economic loss as a function of local temperature is presented in fig 3 a the trend lines were fitted using quantile regression for the 99th percentile to confirm linearity the points present the 99th percentile calculated empirically from the data using a moving temperature window the economic loss for china and the u s exhibit a sensitivity of 14 8 c with the rest of the world demonstrating a sensitivity of economic loss to temperature of 15 2 c we note the analysis was also performed repeated using an observed gridded temperature product rohde et al 2013 berkeley earth 2015 and the results were found to be consistent with those presented in fig 3a the most extreme percentiles have the greatest sensitivity to temperature with less extreme catastrophes less sensitive to higher temperature fig 3b the median catastrophe economic loss sensitivity to temperature is 8 8 c for the u s and china and 2 6 c for the rest of the world using panel regression gave similar results not shown below the median there is evidence of a negative association between economic loss and temperature when the u s and china are excluded the positive associations with temperature for both china and u s and the rest of the world are similar and within confidence limits for the most extreme percentiles the sensitivities of economic loss with temperature are consistent with observed increased storm severity with higher temperatures webster 2005 with this association stronger the more extreme the event wasko and sharma 2017b 4 3 variability with peril the 90th percentile sensitivity of economic loss to temperature for each individual peril flood storm hail using all the data presented in fig 3a is presented in fig 4 a the sensitivities and their statistical significance are summarised in table 1 there are few catastrophes classified as hail fig 1b and hence the sensitivity of hail economic loss with temperature 5 8 c is not statistically significant table 1 however it appears that storm economic loss has a greater more positive sensitivity to temperature 15 8 c than the economic loss from flooding 4 2 c this is consistent with drier soil moisture conditions at higher temperature reducing the sensitivity of floods to higher temperature ivancic and shaw 2015 wasko et al 2019 wasko and nathan 2019 the storm data is subdivided further by storm mechanism fig 4b although hurricanes typhoons and cyclones are a result of similar weather phenomena as they originate in different climatic regions they are classified separately to remove artefacts of spatial pooling indeed catastrophes such as hurricanes typhoons and cyclones are associated with higher temperatures sit towards the right of the figure possibly due to originating in the tropics where temperatures are warmer additionally the economic loss for these catastrophes is much greater than those classified as thunderstorms hence a mixing of storm mechanisms may have introduced an artefact in the pooled analysis of storms with the positive association in temperature due to sampling different storm types originating from different locations for each of the individual storm classifications a positive association between economic loss and temperature is still observed suggesting greater storm severity and economic loss with higher temperatures regardless of storm mechanism and location however the statistical significance of these associations is less due to the smaller sample sizes table 1 4 4 validity of spatial pooling it is prudent to address the validity of normalisation by conducting an analysis without pooling across the global scale a sensitivity test using only data for the u s is presented in fig 5 a the results are consistent with global trends fig 3 suggesting the global pooling results in a homogenous economic loss data set when the results at a continental scale for example europe are investigated the sensitivities are subdued fig 5b the 99th percentile continues to display a sensitivity of approximately 15 c consistent with global results fig 3a but the median displays a sensitivity of 2 c this is not surprising given the mixed signal in flooding throughout europe and small sample size blöschl et al 2017 hall et al 2014 in context with the results presenting sensitivity to storm mechanism fig 4b this suggests that local and regional climatic conditions pielke and landsea 1999 welker and faust 2013 need to be considered as trends in extreme events can be mixed mallakpour and villarini 2015 wasko 2021 and also affected by the uncertainty in extreme value analysis hall et al 2014 however repeating the results classifying on storm mechanism just for the u s our largest economically homogenous sample also showed positive associations with temperature for storms identified as tornado thunderstorm or hurricane not shown 4 5 confounding due to unequal sampling increased temperatures in recent years may correlate with recent catastrophes which are sampled with greater frequency fig 1c inducing a positive sensitivity though this is unlikely as previous studies have not found a trend with temperature anomalies at the global scale miller et al 2008 fig 6 presents the results shown in fig 3b with data resampled to ensure that the number of catastrophes per year is a constant 20 events per year this removes possible bias associated with the number of events being skewed to more recent warmer years the results of resampling are consistent with the positive sensitivity of economic losses with temperature for extreme percentiles presented earlier fig 3 meaning the results presented here are not an artefact of sampling more recent warmer events 5 discussion historical trends in economic loss are often investigated and the trend attributed to climatic change due to the historically increasing greenhouse gasses increasing temperatures and changing atmospheric circulations hence it is common practice and entirely valid to substitute historical global temperature anomalies for the temporal trend as both are strongly correlated but this practice is not necessarily informative of changes to damage due to changed storm intensity as storm intensity is correlated to the absolute temperature and not anomalies as per equation 3 for this reason we associated local temperature with the economic cost of a catastrophic event despite changes in local temperature having better predictive ability of extreme rainfalls than temporal trends agilan and umamahesh 2015 2017 mondal and mujumdar 2015 and historical trends in extreme rainfall severity showing a strong similarity to historical temperature increases sun et al 2021 wasko and nathan 2019 zhang et al 2019 there is significant discussion in the literature on whether day to day variability is representative of a meaningful temporal physical relationship wasko 2021 zhang et al 2017 for example there is no guarantee that a global temperature anomaly is experienced universally with global warming global warming differs by season and latitude with the largest warming in winter and in high latitudes e g the coldest climates hence it may be that the local temperature associations presented here are coupled with this trend though stratifying on region continued to show consistent positive associations with temperature suggesting this is not the case there is also the issue of mixing weather types haerter and berg 2009 magan et al 2020 molnar et al 2015 wasko et al 2015 where different weather events originate in different regions and at different temperatures section 4 3 which can alias to induce a positive signal between storm intensity and temperature separating out the mixing of events such as hurricanes which originate in warmer areas positive associations with temperature for each individual weather type were still found fig 4b with the results consistent with modelled intensification of hurricane harvey van oldenborgh et al 2017 catastrophes that were not been attributed to a storm mechanism labelled other were presented in black fig 4b it is not known whether these storms have simply not been classified and hence may be a mix of the existing classifications or are a mix of storms of varying sizes with a similar storm mechanism however the economic loss associated with these storms does exhibit a sensitivity with temperature at a rate of approximately 12 5 c consistent with greater storm severity at higher temperatures the originating season of weather event has also been suggested as a confounding factor with temperature associations suggested to be a function of seasonality zhang et al 2017 the data presented in fig 3a were stratified on season and showed consistent positive sensitivities despite our best efforts to remove any artefacts there remains a possibility that due to pooling across space positive associations of temperature and economic loss are due to economic loss event mechanisms generally originating from climates with higher temperatures however even if this was to be true a shift to the more intense storm mechanisms associated with higher temperatures is not inconsistent with climate change berg et al 2013 for example the poleward shifts of the tropics is likely to bring with it changing weather types grise et al 2018 seidel et al 2008 staten et al 2018 and increased tropical cyclone activity daloz and camargo 2018 finally it needs to be noted that linearity was assumed between the logarithm of standardised economic loss and temperature this was verified by plotting the empirical percentiles fig 2 but there is no guarantee that this linearity will exist beyond the temperature ranges presented here or in the future if the changes in weather patterns are outside those that can be captured by assuming linearity in the absence of better evidence we continued with the assumption of linearity in this manuscript but note flood damage functions can take many function forms li et al 2016 6 conclusions previous studies that have attempted to link economic loss with temperature anomalies at a global scale did not find a historical trend in economic loss here we investigated the sensitivity association of catastrophe loss with local temperature on a per catastrophe basis consistent with existing literature we found little evidence for increased economic loss in time due to storms increasing in severity however we did find higher local temperatures are associated with greater economic loss the positive association is commensurate with the intensity of the event that is the more extreme the catastrophe the more positive the association these results are consistent with the physical reasoning of greater storm intensity and severity at higher temperatures and historical trends of increased severity of precipitation and flood extremes with climate change the focus here was on catastrophe severity and not the frequency of catastrophes if catastrophe frequency was to increase mallakpour and villarini 2015 molnar et al 2015 then economic losses as an aggregation could be expected to increase also held et al 2013 mills et al 2002 it is likely that both greater storm intensities at higher temperatures and an increased sampling of more catastrophic storm types such as hurricanes originating at higher temperatures result in the positive association of economic losses and local temperatures observed here although our analysis cannot be directly linked to rising global temperatures as a result of climate change the results suggest any possible future shift in storm type with higher temperatures coupled with increasing storm severity may further exacerbate economic losses from natural catastrophes credit authorship contribution

4194,increases in the magnitude of storm and flood related catastrophes due to climate change are predicted to increase associated economic losses there exists however conflicting evidence for greater economic losses despite well acknowledged increases in the severity of observed extreme events in recent decades here using a worldwide catastrophe insurance database from 1970 to 2015 we link the catastrophe economic loss from extreme storms and floods to local temperature we find a statistically significant positive association between economic losses expressed as a proportion of gdp and local temperature the association between economic losses and temperature is greater as the event becomes more extreme with the signal muted for flooding as compared to storms although local associations of economic loss with temperature cannot be directly linked to rising global temperatures as a result of climate change the positive economic loss temperature associations are consistent with observed extreme precipitation temperature associations and hence pertinent to the advancement of understanding future natural catastrophes keywords extreme precipitation flood temperature climate change catastrophe economic loss 1 introduction storm related climate catastrophes result in major loss of life and widespread economic damage with developing countries particularly exposed as they lack the financial and material resources to mitigate impacts razavi et al 2020 overall the economic losses from these catastrophes are expected to be exacerbated by climatic change arent et al 2014 ipcc 2012 this expectation is supported by evidence from dynamic downscaling of individual weather events and statistical downscaling of global climate models both of which predict increased insurance losses can be expected as we head into the significantly warmer temperatures over the rest of this century held et al 2013 the contribution of climate change to economic loss potential from storm events is largely based on the assumption of increasing storm intensity driven via the clausius clapeyron relation assuming constant relative humidity this physical relationship dictates that as temperatures increase so does the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere and hence extreme precipitation intensity should increase as a result trenberth 2011 trenberth et al 2003 this in turn is predicted to lead to increased flood risk trenberth et al 2003 westra et al 2014 particularly in urban settings fadhel et al 2018 hettiarachchi et al 2018 miller and hutchins 2017 increases in precipitation intensity are likely to be coupled with changes in storm temporal pattern wasko and sharma 2015 as well as duration emmanuel et al 2012 webster 2005 and areal extent prein et al 2017 storms may also invigorate due to increased latent heat release at higher absolute humidity intensifying upward motions lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 trenberth et al 2003 or change due to larger atmospheric changes such at the expansion of the hadley cell grise et al 2018 mathew and kumar 2019 seidel et al 2008 staten et al 2018 increasing the frequency of extreme precipitation events myhre et al 2019 all these factors are predicted to lead to increased storm severity with climate change seneviratne et al 2012 observed increases in extreme precipitation flooding and storm severity are abound in literature do et al 2017 donat et al 2013 emanuel 2005 martinez villalobos and neelin 2018 o gorman 2015 slater et al 2021 sun et al 2021 wasko and nathan 2019 westra et al 2013a while historical changes in climate extremes have been attributed to anthropogenic climate change diffenbaugh et al 2017 kay et al 2011 min et al 2011 pall et al 2011 the linking of economic losses to climatic change is more difficult bouwer 2011 hoeppe 2016 changes in economic losses have been associated with local climate variability pielke and landsea 1999 welker and faust 2013 and the economic cost of hurricane harvey has recently been attributed to climate change frame et al 2020 but debate remains on whether temporal trends in economic loss exist paprotny et al 2018 although a summary of historical studies finds more studies observe increases rather than decreases in economic loss bouwer 2011 after appropriate normalisation for increases in economic growth studies generally find little temporal trend and hence association with climate change arent et al 2014 for example normalised total annual losses from hurricanes in the united states pielke et al 2008 weinkle et al 2018 and latin america and the caribbean pielke et al 2003 show no temporal trend likewise no climate change signal was identified in normalised annual aggregations of flood losses across europe barredo 2009 global normalised economic loss aggregations across various natural disaster types also display no statistically significant upward trend barthel and neumayer 2012 neumayer and barthel 2011 with continental australian studies showing similar results crompton and mcaneney 2008 mcaneney et al 2019 as global temperatures have been monotonically increasing and can be substituted for a temporal trend there is likewise no link found between increasing global temperatures and increasing global economic losses miller et al 2008 the two primary arguments for differing trends in economic loss are the method of normalisation of economic loss barthel and neumayer 2012 kron et al 2019 and the absence of consideration of changes in vulnerability mechler and bouwer 2015 for example climate change signals may be obscured by increasing defences and resilience to climatic catastrophes nicholls 2011 meaning increases in economic loss are not as large as they would have been had vulnerability reducing measures not been implemented mechler and bouwer 2015 here we suggest another possibility as global warming does not always affect the global temperature uniformly neukom et al 2019 it may be that higher global temperatures will not be associated with greater economic losses but local temperatures will there is significant evidence that local temperature influences storm severity lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 peleg et al 2018 changes in both tropical cyclones and local scale convective events have been correlated to increases in temperature lenderink and attema 2015 webster 2005 increased lightning strikes have been linked to higher temperatures molnar et al 2015 and a greater number of insurance claims mills 2005 indeed local temperature sensitivities have been shown to be the primary variable explaining rainfall variability across various temporal scales wasko and sharma 2017a westra et al 2013b with higher temperatures linked to greater flood event magnitude wasko and sharma 2017b local temperature increases have been successfully used as a predictor in non stationary analysis of flood risk condon et al 2015 towler et al 2010 and extreme rainfall agilan and umamahesh 2015 mondal and mujumdar 2015 even being linked to indicators of water quality guo et al 2021 and hence health outcomes jhajharia et al 2013 as discussed above storm extremes are linked to higher temperatures from the increased moisture carrying capacity of a warmer atmosphere as specified by the clausius clapeyron relationship roderick et al 2019 trenberth 2011 assuming constant relative humidity this increase in moisture carrying capacity can lead to larger downpours especially over short periods of time where local moisture contributes substantially fowler et al 2021 while this physical link to temperature becomes weaker when the relationship is extended to other derived variables such as floods sharma et al 2018 tramblay et al 2019 wasko 2021 and economic loss nicholls 2011 a positive link with extreme precipitation is well established hence here we seek to investigate can a link between temperature and the economic loss resulting from extreme hydrologic and meteorological events be identified we analyse natural disasters on a per event basis rather than a total or annual economic loss to capture the event severity in terms of economic loss the normalised temporal trend on a per catastrophe basis is first analysed to see if economic losses have increased due to an increase in event severity next because global temperature anomalies are not necessarily spatially uniform the sensitivity of normalised economic loss to local temperature as a driver of storm intensification is investigated the influence of storm severity and the originating storm mechanism on the relationship of normalised economic loss to local temperature are also investigated finally the implications in the context of climate change are discussed 2 data in this study we use the sigma catastrophe database for the years 1970 to 2015 swissre 2016 sigma represents a comprehensive database of significant catastrophe events collated from newspapers direct and reinsurance periodicals specialist publications and reports from re insurers this data set provides information on 5024 natural catastrophes for which various statistics are reported including fatalities economic loss and insured loss here we focus on the economic loss the economic loss consists of both infrastructure damage stock losses and lost production due to economic interruption flow losses the total economic loss is reported as a nominal loss in the local currency the local loss in u s dollars and the inflated loss in 2016 u s dollars the nominal economic loss is converted to u s dollars using the end of year exchange rate and subsequently the u s dollar value is adjusted for inflation using the us consumer price index to give economic loss for the base year 2016 consistent with insurance industry practice catastrophes are classified on the type of catastrophe using peril terminology these perils are storms floods hail heat related catastrophes such as droughts and fires cold related catastrophes such blizzards earthquakes or unclassified storm damages generally stem from events causing water ingress or wind driven rain damage whereas flood events are generally from riverine inundation such as over topping of riverbanks perils originating from blizzards can be classified as either cold related catastrophes or storms depending on the primary peril a description of each event is also given providing the storm mechanism for example the haiyan typhoon of 2013 in the philippines is classified as a storm and described as haiyan typhoon such data sets provide a quantitative link between the hydrologic sciences and economic loss gao et al 2019 here we focus on the hydrologic storm related catastrophes that is storms floods and hail events a total of 1985 events the location of each catastrophe is reported as a region state territory or country for this study the location description was mapped to geographical coordinates using an application programming interface the location and economic loss of each catastrophe is presented in fig 1 a economic loss is highly non linear with the largest 50 of events responsible for 97 of losses and the largest 10 responsible for 75 of losses after normalisation section 3 1 the automated matching of each catastrophe event to a set of coordinates was verified manually the proportion of catastrophes classified as either storms or floods far exceeds those classified as hail fig 1b the number of recorded events has increased in time fig 1c with few recorded events prior to 1985 for countries with more than 20 recorded catastrophes the number of catastrophes is summarised in fig 1d most recorded events are in the unites states europe and china fig 1a 1d 3 methods 3 1 normalisation of individual catastrophes we analyse economic loss on a per catastrophe basis to isolate possible increases in storm severity the effect of normalisation on economic loss is discussed in detail in neumayer and barthel 2011 for spatial pooling for a given catastrophe year t normalising by the country wealth is recommended neumayer and barthel 2011 1 y i normalisedeconomicloss i economicloss i t wealth t this results in a sample of normalised economic loss yi where i 1 n and n is the total number of events as presented in fig 1a as long as the wealth is for the same year as the economic loss the result is a dimensionless ratio of the actual loss to the potential loss aplr which can then be pooled spatially neumayer and barthel 2011 as discussed economic loss consists of both losses to physical infrastructure stock and losses related to economic disruption flow to accurately normalise a measure of wealth is required a simplification is to use gdp as a wealth measure although gdp is a flow measure it is typically highly correlated with wealth stock neumayer and barthel 2011 resulting in consistent normalisations paprotny et al 2018 here the nominal gross domestic product in u s dollars un 2017 is used as an indicator of wealth consistent with standard practice munich 2016 and previous studies neumayer and barthel 2011 pielke and landsea 1999 welker and faust 2013 twelve catastrophes with a normalised economic loss aplr above 0 4 were removed these catastrophes were for small nations where the normalised economic loss is improbably high neumayer and barthel 2011 removal of these data points did not affect the results presented 3 2 analysis of temporal trend for temporal analysis the total normalised economic loss for each calendar year is divided by the number of catastrophes recorded to find the average normalised economic loss per catastrophe per year the temporal trend of normalised economic loss per catastrophe per year was assessed using the non parametric rank based kendall s tau correlation kendall 1975 1938 kendall s tau is a rank based non parametric correlation measure which equals 1 if all pairs are concordant and 1 if all pairs are discordant equation 2 2 τ n c n d n n 1 2 where n c and n d are the number of concordant discordant pairs respectively and n is the number of observations in this case years the temporal trend was calculated with a varying start and end year ensuring that the minimum record length considered was 10 years this allowed consideration of change points or bias due to an individual year or short period having a high normalised economic loss due to the possibility of serial autocorrelation it is prudent to use multiple trend tests zamani et al 2017 the analysis was repeated using a modified mann kendall test with bias corrected pre whitening to remove the effect of any serial correlation hamed 2009 as the results were consistent with those based on kendall s tau the results presented here focus on the use of kendall s tau 3 3 analysis of temperature associations the clausius clapeyron equation describes how the equilibrium vapour pressure es varies with temperature t 3 e s t e s l v t r v t 2 where l v is the latent heat of vapourisation and r v is the gas constant as temperature increases the saturation vapour pressure increases exponentially translating to an increase between 5 7 and 6 7 c in the range 10 30 c wasko 2021 hence the intensity and severity of an extreme storm event can be linked to local temperature agilan and umamahesh 2017 fowler et al 2021 lenderink and attema 2015 here each standardised catastrophe event was matched to the local ncep ncar reanalysis1 monthly temperature on a 2 5 grid kalnay et al 1996 ncep 1994 based on the start time of the catastrophe monthly temperature was used as it has been shown be an effective predictor for non stationary flood risk condon et al 2015 towler et al 2010 and extreme rainfall intensities agilan and umamahesh 2015 cross et al 2020 wasko and sharma 2017a the analysis was also performed using an observed 1 0 gridded dataset rohde et al 2013 berkeley earth 2015 with the results found to be almost identical all the standardised catastrophe events equation 1 with their matched local temperature were pooled and their sensitivity association to temperature was investigated using quantile regression koenker and bassett 1978 wasko and sharma 2014 quantile regression was implemented in the statistical software r using the package quantreg koenker 2021 quantile regression allows the response with differing event rarity to be investigated and is less biased to outlying data here a quantile regression is fitted to the logarithm of economic loss quantile regression is similar to linear regression and is expressed as per equation 4 but a cost function d is used to minimize deviation from the quantile q of interest equation 5 that is for a regression of the form where yi is the normalised economic loss for each catastrophe and ti is the local monthly temperature 4 l o g y i β 0 q β 1 q t i the regression coefficients β 0 q and β 1 q are chosen to minimize a cost function d defined as 5 d β 0 q β 1 q q y i β 0 q β 1 q t i y i β 0 q β 1 q t i 1 q y i β 0 q β 1 q t i y i β 0 q β 1 q t i for example to regress for the 99th percentile q is set equal to 0 99 and substituted into equation 5 to calculate the regression coefficients β 0 0 99 and β 1 0 99 this substitution results in a large weight for the first summation term points above the regression line and a small weight for the second summation term points below the regression line resulting in regression coefficients being optimised to minimise the absolute difference of fitted values close to the first summation term that is the fitted regression line to the 99th percentile of all the data the sensitivity of the normalised economic loss y as a percentage change per degree in temperature is then calculated by 6 δ y 100 10 β 1 1 as china and the u s account for almost 40 of our catastrophe sample fig 1d and have the two largest global gross domestic products the catastrophe data is split between these two countries and those remaining to prevent possible bias due to the uneven sample of events between countries individual quantiles were calculated using a 2 c moving temperature window to confirm the assumption of linearity between the logarithm of normalised economic loss and temperature to analyse the possible impact of storm mechanism each event description was mined for key words these were tornado thunderstorm hurricane typhoon and cyclone tropical storm descriptions without these key words were classified as other storms and include storms described as winter storms as well as storms without any additional description the temperature range used for regression to remove the influence of outliers is indicated in each figure by the extents of the fitted regression 4 results 4 1 temporal trend a time series of the normalised economic loss per catastrophe per year is presented in fig 2 a for simplicity from here on economic loss refers to the economic loss standardised by gdp a surface of kendall s tau statistic for monotonic trend is presented in fig 2b statistical significance is presented in fig 2c the trend test is performed on a moving window of years with a minimum of 10 years required for testing economic loss per catastrophe is seen to increase only if the data pre 1980 is included but there is minimal catastrophe data recorded before 1985 fig 1c when data pre 1980 is omitted no statistically significant trends are obtained these results are consistent with previous global studies that used annual aggregations rather than the per event analysis performed here that concluded there is little evidence for a temporal increase in catastrophe related economic loss miller et al 2008 neumayer and barthel 2011 4 2 sensitivity to temperature the economic loss as a function of local temperature is presented in fig 3 a the trend lines were fitted using quantile regression for the 99th percentile to confirm linearity the points present the 99th percentile calculated empirically from the data using a moving temperature window the economic loss for china and the u s exhibit a sensitivity of 14 8 c with the rest of the world demonstrating a sensitivity of economic loss to temperature of 15 2 c we note the analysis was also performed repeated using an observed gridded temperature product rohde et al 2013 berkeley earth 2015 and the results were found to be consistent with those presented in fig 3a the most extreme percentiles have the greatest sensitivity to temperature with less extreme catastrophes less sensitive to higher temperature fig 3b the median catastrophe economic loss sensitivity to temperature is 8 8 c for the u s and china and 2 6 c for the rest of the world using panel regression gave similar results not shown below the median there is evidence of a negative association between economic loss and temperature when the u s and china are excluded the positive associations with temperature for both china and u s and the rest of the world are similar and within confidence limits for the most extreme percentiles the sensitivities of economic loss with temperature are consistent with observed increased storm severity with higher temperatures webster 2005 with this association stronger the more extreme the event wasko and sharma 2017b 4 3 variability with peril the 90th percentile sensitivity of economic loss to temperature for each individual peril flood storm hail using all the data presented in fig 3a is presented in fig 4 a the sensitivities and their statistical significance are summarised in table 1 there are few catastrophes classified as hail fig 1b and hence the sensitivity of hail economic loss with temperature 5 8 c is not statistically significant table 1 however it appears that storm economic loss has a greater more positive sensitivity to temperature 15 8 c than the economic loss from flooding 4 2 c this is consistent with drier soil moisture conditions at higher temperature reducing the sensitivity of floods to higher temperature ivancic and shaw 2015 wasko et al 2019 wasko and nathan 2019 the storm data is subdivided further by storm mechanism fig 4b although hurricanes typhoons and cyclones are a result of similar weather phenomena as they originate in different climatic regions they are classified separately to remove artefacts of spatial pooling indeed catastrophes such as hurricanes typhoons and cyclones are associated with higher temperatures sit towards the right of the figure possibly due to originating in the tropics where temperatures are warmer additionally the economic loss for these catastrophes is much greater than those classified as thunderstorms hence a mixing of storm mechanisms may have introduced an artefact in the pooled analysis of storms with the positive association in temperature due to sampling different storm types originating from different locations for each of the individual storm classifications a positive association between economic loss and temperature is still observed suggesting greater storm severity and economic loss with higher temperatures regardless of storm mechanism and location however the statistical significance of these associations is less due to the smaller sample sizes table 1 4 4 validity of spatial pooling it is prudent to address the validity of normalisation by conducting an analysis without pooling across the global scale a sensitivity test using only data for the u s is presented in fig 5 a the results are consistent with global trends fig 3 suggesting the global pooling results in a homogenous economic loss data set when the results at a continental scale for example europe are investigated the sensitivities are subdued fig 5b the 99th percentile continues to display a sensitivity of approximately 15 c consistent with global results fig 3a but the median displays a sensitivity of 2 c this is not surprising given the mixed signal in flooding throughout europe and small sample size blöschl et al 2017 hall et al 2014 in context with the results presenting sensitivity to storm mechanism fig 4b this suggests that local and regional climatic conditions pielke and landsea 1999 welker and faust 2013 need to be considered as trends in extreme events can be mixed mallakpour and villarini 2015 wasko 2021 and also affected by the uncertainty in extreme value analysis hall et al 2014 however repeating the results classifying on storm mechanism just for the u s our largest economically homogenous sample also showed positive associations with temperature for storms identified as tornado thunderstorm or hurricane not shown 4 5 confounding due to unequal sampling increased temperatures in recent years may correlate with recent catastrophes which are sampled with greater frequency fig 1c inducing a positive sensitivity though this is unlikely as previous studies have not found a trend with temperature anomalies at the global scale miller et al 2008 fig 6 presents the results shown in fig 3b with data resampled to ensure that the number of catastrophes per year is a constant 20 events per year this removes possible bias associated with the number of events being skewed to more recent warmer years the results of resampling are consistent with the positive sensitivity of economic losses with temperature for extreme percentiles presented earlier fig 3 meaning the results presented here are not an artefact of sampling more recent warmer events 5 discussion historical trends in economic loss are often investigated and the trend attributed to climatic change due to the historically increasing greenhouse gasses increasing temperatures and changing atmospheric circulations hence it is common practice and entirely valid to substitute historical global temperature anomalies for the temporal trend as both are strongly correlated but this practice is not necessarily informative of changes to damage due to changed storm intensity as storm intensity is correlated to the absolute temperature and not anomalies as per equation 3 for this reason we associated local temperature with the economic cost of a catastrophic event despite changes in local temperature having better predictive ability of extreme rainfalls than temporal trends agilan and umamahesh 2015 2017 mondal and mujumdar 2015 and historical trends in extreme rainfall severity showing a strong similarity to historical temperature increases sun et al 2021 wasko and nathan 2019 zhang et al 2019 there is significant discussion in the literature on whether day to day variability is representative of a meaningful temporal physical relationship wasko 2021 zhang et al 2017 for example there is no guarantee that a global temperature anomaly is experienced universally with global warming global warming differs by season and latitude with the largest warming in winter and in high latitudes e g the coldest climates hence it may be that the local temperature associations presented here are coupled with this trend though stratifying on region continued to show consistent positive associations with temperature suggesting this is not the case there is also the issue of mixing weather types haerter and berg 2009 magan et al 2020 molnar et al 2015 wasko et al 2015 where different weather events originate in different regions and at different temperatures section 4 3 which can alias to induce a positive signal between storm intensity and temperature separating out the mixing of events such as hurricanes which originate in warmer areas positive associations with temperature for each individual weather type were still found fig 4b with the results consistent with modelled intensification of hurricane harvey van oldenborgh et al 2017 catastrophes that were not been attributed to a storm mechanism labelled other were presented in black fig 4b it is not known whether these storms have simply not been classified and hence may be a mix of the existing classifications or are a mix of storms of varying sizes with a similar storm mechanism however the economic loss associated with these storms does exhibit a sensitivity with temperature at a rate of approximately 12 5 c consistent with greater storm severity at higher temperatures the originating season of weather event has also been suggested as a confounding factor with temperature associations suggested to be a function of seasonality zhang et al 2017 the data presented in fig 3a were stratified on season and showed consistent positive sensitivities despite our best efforts to remove any artefacts there remains a possibility that due to pooling across space positive associations of temperature and economic loss are due to economic loss event mechanisms generally originating from climates with higher temperatures however even if this was to be true a shift to the more intense storm mechanisms associated with higher temperatures is not inconsistent with climate change berg et al 2013 for example the poleward shifts of the tropics is likely to bring with it changing weather types grise et al 2018 seidel et al 2008 staten et al 2018 and increased tropical cyclone activity daloz and camargo 2018 finally it needs to be noted that linearity was assumed between the logarithm of standardised economic loss and temperature this was verified by plotting the empirical percentiles fig 2 but there is no guarantee that this linearity will exist beyond the temperature ranges presented here or in the future if the changes in weather patterns are outside those that can be captured by assuming linearity in the absence of better evidence we continued with the assumption of linearity in this manuscript but note flood damage functions can take many function forms li et al 2016 6 conclusions previous studies that have attempted to link economic loss with temperature anomalies at a global scale did not find a historical trend in economic loss here we investigated the sensitivity association of catastrophe loss with local temperature on a per catastrophe basis consistent with existing literature we found little evidence for increased economic loss in time due to storms increasing in severity however we did find higher local temperatures are associated with greater economic loss the positive association is commensurate with the intensity of the event that is the more extreme the catastrophe the more positive the association these results are consistent with the physical reasoning of greater storm intensity and severity at higher temperatures and historical trends of increased severity of precipitation and flood extremes with climate change the focus here was on catastrophe severity and not the frequency of catastrophes if catastrophe frequency was to increase mallakpour and villarini 2015 molnar et al 2015 then economic losses as an aggregation could be expected to increase also held et al 2013 mills et al 2002 it is likely that both greater storm intensities at higher temperatures and an increased sampling of more catastrophic storm types such as hurricanes originating at higher temperatures result in the positive association of economic losses and local temperatures observed here although our analysis cannot be directly linked to rising global temperatures as a result of climate change the results suggest any possible future shift in storm type with higher temperatures coupled with increasing storm severity may further exacerbate economic losses from natural catastrophes credit authorship contribution
