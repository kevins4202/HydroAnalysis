most widely used carbon cathodes in ff process although thermodynamic instability has been found there are no clear reports on the negative effects on organics evolution and possible ways of cathodic corrosion of cf this study first report the carbon dissolution and cathodic corrosion of cf cathode and revealed a possible corrosion pathway an ff system using carbon felt cathode was constructed

to the accumulation of organic carbon toxic organic intermediates were detected and negatively affected biodegradability and acute cytotoxicity the main cause of cathodic corrosion was the electroreduction of carbon species on cf hydrogen peroxide indirectly promoted the corrosion process by consuming reducing carbon species optimizing the appropriate electrolysis time such as 60 min or

cleaning garages pose serious problems for environmental protection and resource conservation 1 4 unfortunately the excess surfactants found in cww are harmful to aquatic animals 5 6 and can bioaccumulate in living organisms 7 moreover the hydrophobicity of cww makes removal with traditional biological treatments difficult 8 9 additionally the wax used for car maintenance is difficult to degrade with traditional treatment processes 7 electro fenton is an eco friendly electrochemical advanced oxidation process 10 12 it utilizes free radicals typically the hydroxyl radicals oh e0 2 80 v vs she generated in situ by activating h2o2 which can nonselectively oxidize organic pollutants in cww 1 in the currently defined electro fenton ef system h2o2 is produced by cathodic electroreduction based on this method of h2o2 production the efficiency of ef system will be greatly limited by the capability of cathodic electrocatalysis and mass transfer 13 at present many studies for actual wastewater treatment will adopt the method of adding additional h2o2 in the ef process which is usually defined as the fered fenton ff 14 the performance is notably enhanced 15 and its advantages have been proven in the degradation of various pollutants 14 16 17 therefore ff is considered to be a promising technology because of its simple operation high stability and high removal rate the ff process usually requires a high hydrogen evolution potential of cathode material to avoid parasitic reactions 18 carbonaceous electrodes have been widely used as cathode materials because of their good conductivity and excellent electrocatalytic activity for a variety of redox reactions 19 to date a variety of carbonaceous materials including but not limited to carbon felt graphite felt carbon rods carbon polytetrafluoroethylene carbon sponge have been used as cathode materials in electrochemical processes 11 12 20 21 as a classical gas diffusion cathode carbon felt cf is perhaps one of the most widely studied carbon cathodes due to its low cost low toxicity easy availability high hydrogen evolution potential and high oxygen reduction reaction orr activity 22 although cf shows good application prospects 18 21 23 there are still intrinsic drawbacks that seem unavoidable for cf generally we agree that lowering the electrochemical potential of the cathode makes the oxidation of the cathode thermodynamically unfavorable although tempting this suggestion is not always correct at sufficiently negative potentials the cathode can start corroding through a phenomenon known as cathodic corrosion 24 the cathodic corrosion of metal cathodes is well known as hydrogen embrittlement however the cathodic corrosion of carbonaceous cathodes has not been clearly reported thus far some studies have reported that cf can be consumed when used as cathode 25 or found the carbon dissolution during electrolysis of other carbonaceous cathodes 21 but there is no clear conclusion on the possible pathway and effects of cf cathode corrosion therefore it is difficult to optimize or predict the cf structure and potential service time for engineering applications herein carbon dissolution and cathodic corrosion of cf are reported for the first time the removal of chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate las of cww was realized in the constructed ff system after verifying the carbon dissolution of the cf cathode during electrolysis its negative effects were analyzed through comparative experiments and assessment of organic matter evolution the cathodic corrosion of cf was confirmed by detailed electrochemical experiments and the role of h2o2 in this process was determined the mechanisms by which cf cathodic corrosion occurs were studied from the perspective of the electrochemical cathodic behavior and corrosion pathway with prospects for cf cathodes the result of this study provide new insights and relevant theoretical support for the actual application of cf cathodes 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the synthetic cww used in this study was prepared by dissolving car wash shampoo and car wash wax in ultrapure water all detergents were obtained from self service car wash plants in beijing stored in polypropylene drums and kept at 4 c before experiments the ph value of synthetic cww was 5 02 which was deem 5 0 in this study the concentrations of cod toc and las were 1513 3 82 4 592 1 32 2 and 1479 12 1 mg l respectively the reagents used in this study were of analytical grade or higher and were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china all solutions were prepared using ultrapure water 2 2 experimental setup all electrochemical experiments were conducted in a plexiglass reactor with 500 ml of cww commercial ti ruo2 electrode with high electrocatalytic activity and excellent mechanical stability was used as the anode 15 all electrodes were spaced 1 5 cm apart the surface areas of the ti ruo2 anode iron mesh bipolar electrode and cf cathode were all 68 8 cm2 16 cm 4 3 cm and the electrodes were purchased from yiwanlin electronic technology co ltd in kunshan china the cf electrode was ultrasonically cleaned with acetone and ultrapure water thoroughly washed with ultrapure water and dried overnight at 55 c a zhaoxin kxn 645d system with a voltage range of 0 64 v was selected as the dc power supply the traditional ff process introduces fe2 from a sacrificial iron anode or uses another addition method 13 in this study an electrochemical system was constructed by introducing an iron mesh bipolar electrode between the anode and cathode to provide fe2 prior to electrolysis for improving current efficiency na2so4 0 05 m was added to cww as the supporting electrolyte and the initial ph value was adjusted to the desired value with h2so4 and naoh for experiments requiring aeration compressed air was continuously pumped into the bulk solution at a flow rate of 1 5 l min a period of 10 min before electrolysis was sufficient to reach a stationary o2 level h2o2 30 w w was added once before electrolysis all experiments were carried out in duplicate at room temperature 22 2 c and the reaction liquid was stirred by a magnetic agitator to ensure uniform 800 rpm mass transfer in this study h2o2 was consumed completely after 120 min in all experiments involving applied current therefore 120 min was selected as the termination time for electrolysis in this study cf was always used as the cathode h2o2 only group was set as a control and five experimental strategies were explored i anodic oxidation ao ii ao with an extra dose of h2o2 ao h2o2 iii ao h2o2 with the introduction of iron mesh to initiate the ff chain reaction with no aeration imffs no aeration iv the use of iron mesh without an extra dose of h2o2 but with aeration where h2o2 was electrogenerated in situ by the ef process ef with iron mesh system imefs and v an ff system with the same configuration as iv but adding h2o2 imffs 2 3 analytical methods considering that h2o2 is a component of cod residual h2o2 was removed by mixing mno2 99 9 particles with the samples and vibrating for 20 min all samples were filtered with 0 45 μm membrane filters prior to analysis cod and las were determined using a uv spectrophotometer dr 6000 hach usa according to a standard method 26 toc was measured with a toc analyzer multi n c 2100 analytik jena germany each test was conducted in duplicate and standard deviations were reported to minimize experimental errors the analytical

gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms and cytotoxicity test used in this study are described in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 ff optimization for cww treatment for the treatment of cww using ff process a series of electrochemical configurations were screened fig 1a and b since the current research shows that the acidic environment is conducive to the ef process 13 15 the initial ph is set at 3 0 the h2o2 control experiment showed that oxidation by h2o2 was limited in the absence of fe2 fig 1a and b in general imffs showed the strongest degradation capability predictably it was difficult to remove contaminants rapidly by ao active anodes such as ti ruo2 are difficult to produce free radicals like non active anodes such as born doped diamond anode 27 28 and they tend to produce mox oh with limited oxidation capacity on anode surface m is the catalytic mental in active anodes 29 30 in comparison to the performance of imefs the addition of h2o2 accelerated the pollution removal rates of ao h2o2 imffs no aeration and imffs since h2o2 was not added to the imefs pollution removal was slow and this system may take longer to treat cww most studies have adopted the practice of adding additional h2o2 ff process to treat wastewater 14 15 the cod removal efficiencies of imffs no aeration and imffs were 42 0 and 95 1 higher respectively than that of ao h2o2 fig 1a this result further proves the advantages of iron mesh bipolar electrode actually the free electrons in the iron mesh move along a certain direction under an applied electric field leading to a potential difference on the electrode surface and realizing polarization fig 6 the iron mesh bipolar electrode exhibited electrode characteristics at the corresponding positions i e cathode characteristics at the side near the anode and anode characteristics at the side near the cathode 15 31 therefore the iron mesh bipolar electrode enhanced the performance of the electrochemical system due to its bipolar characteristics and dissolved fe2 fig 1f inset and the electric field in the system was utilized effectively leading to an increase in e sp fig s9 in this study imffs was deemed the optimal system for cww treatment current density is a key operating parameter and it affects the performance of the electrochemical process by controlling the electrochemical reaction rate 28 for this reason the performance of imffs was studied with different current densities as shown in fig 1c the cod removal efficiency at a high current density was significantly higher than that at a low current density this result can be explained by the enhanced ff reaction and the increase in oh concentration controlled by the current density 1 27 1 fe2 h2o2 h fe3 h2o oh 2 h2o2 oh ho2 h2o the ph of the bulk solution has an important influence on the morphology of fe species and the decomposition of h2o2 10 13 15 generally at ph 2 5 the oxidation of organic compounds is inhibited and stable fe h2o 2 complexes are formed this leads to the inactivation of fe2 and the formation of h3o2 from h2o2 and h 10 thus inhibiting the fenton reaction eq 1 a high ph value ph 5 0 is also not conducive to cod removal and will reduce the oxidation potential of oh and produce fe oh n to inactivate fe2 31 to test the effect of ph on the performance of imffs a series of experiments were carried out with initial ph values of 3 0 9 0 fig 1d shows that optimum removal was realized when the initial ph value was 3 0 to obtain suitable acidity and prevent the precipitation of dissolved iron the best ph values were in the range 2 5 3 5 10 13 however pollutants can also be removed by electrocoagulation ec mechanism with fe oh n at ph 7 0 and 9 0 therefore a higher cod removal higher was obtained at a ph value of 9 0 than that of 7 0 fig 1d because it is more conducive to the formation of fe oh n flocculant under alkaline conditions 32 in addition in the ph value range of 4 0 6 0 it is conducive to the fenton reaction and ec occur simultaneously 31 so it still has an acceptable cod removal when ph 5 0 fig 1d excessive h2o2 levels can lead to a scavenging reaction eq 2 several studies have reported the effects of h2o2 concentration on the ff process 1 15 28 as shown in fig 1e although low h2o2 doses 3 ml 200 ml and 5 ml 200 ml significantly improved the removal efficiency of cod the process then entered a plateau which was attributed to insufficient h2o2 content therefore 7 ml 200 ml was deemed the optimal h2o2 dosage for imffs fig 1e under the optimal conditions j 70 ma cm2 initial ph 3 0 h2o2 dosage 7 ml 200 ml 2 h treatment it achieved 65 1 cod removal 49 8 toc removal and 78 5 las removal fig 1f indicating that a high concentration of surfactant can be effectively degraded notably an appropriate h2o2 content was beneficial to the ff system when the concentration of h2o2 exceeded the threshold the utilization efficiency of h2o2 decreased 28 it should be noted that when the h2o2 dose was increased to 9 ml 200 ml the initial removal rate slowed and a cod rise occurred later fig 1e the slowing of the initial removal rate was due to scavenging of oh by h2o2 eq 2 moreover the rise in cod was probably caused by the carbon dissolution of cf cathode so it is necessary to study this phenomenon in depth 3 2 cathode carbon dissolution and changes of organic matter increases in cod and toc concentrations were found in blank electrolyte fig 2a there is no organic matter in the blank electrolyte and only cf cathode contains carbon in the system therefore these increases were attributed to carbon dissolution from cf cathode during electrolysis similar behavior was also observed in previous studies 21 25 even when used as a cathode cf is still corroded due to its thermodynamic instability 21 33 34 in this study we observed that cathodic corrosion of cf mainly resulted in carbon dissolution and changes in surface functional groups figs 2a and s5 different degrees of damage were found in the cf cathodes used in section 3 1 fig s5 which will be discussed below by statistical analysis fig 2b based on the above it is speculated that cf cathode will inevitably affect the evolution of organic matter in the electrolysis process therefore a comparison was made between an insoluble titanium ti cathode with stable physical and chemical properties 2 and a cf cathode fig 3 during electrolysis the biodegradability of cww improved the 5 day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 cod b c of the effluent reached 0 40 and 0 44 with cf and ti cathodes respectively fig 3a notably b c decreased significantly during the period from 60 to 120 min a similar change occurred for cytotoxicity which showed an increase in the inhibition rate fig 3b to determine the changes of organic matter in this process gc ms analyses of the samples were performed at 0 60 and 120 min and the results are shown in fig 3c d macromolecular long chain alkanes were detected in the raw samples 0 min these compounds were mainly white waxy substances which were derived from the water wax used in car washing notably nearly 30 new products were detected under both cf and ti cathode conditions these products were mainly intermediate products resulting from degradation moreover due to quenching of oh by alcohols 35 the dodecanol 14 48 was observed which was probably the product of hydrogen extraction from 1 dodecanol 15 31 fig 3c d however when using cf cathode the presence of the new product 2 4 di t butylphenol 15 73 was the main reason for the reduction in b c and increased cytotoxicity fig 3c 2 4 di t butylphenol fig s3 is a precursor of fine chemical products and has the same properties as most phenolic compounds 36 it damages the cell membranes of activated sludge bacteria after entering a biochemical system causing inhibitory and toxic effects on microorganisms 37 in this study the toxic intermediates were believed to be caused by excessive electrolysis which led to carbon dissolution of cf and reactions with oxidizing species such as reactive oxygen species ros an appropriate electrolysis time e g 60 min allowed further treatment of cww by subsequent microbial processes giving a high b c value and no toxic intermediates fig 3a b therefore the time and intensity of electrolysis control the production of toxic intermediates 38 typical uv spectrum characteristics such as suva254 suva270 and e253 e203 are related to the abundances of aromatics phenols and the number of substituents in the benzene ring 39 e300 e400 and e250 e365 are related to the molecular weight of organic matters while e265 e465 can indicate the number of conjugated unsaturated bonds in organic structure such as co and cc 40 they were selected as the organic evolution indicators with the aforementioned experimental data cod toc las carbon dissolution bod5 cod and cytotoxicity to perform the statistical analysis the relationship between the changes of organic matter and carbon dissolution in the fered fenton treatment process was analyzed by correlation analysis fig s12 the significant statistical correlation indicated that the dimensionality of the above indicators can be reduced by principal component analysis pca fig 2b as a result suva254 suva270 and e253 e203 were closely clustered with the cytotoxicity it meant that the increased cytotoxicity was mainly caused by phenols consistent with the gc ms results and biodegradability was also negatively affected moreover the carbon dissolution of the cathode increased the molecular weight of dissolved organic matter e300 e400 and e250 e365 and may have been mainly responsible for the increase in the number of cc and co bonds e265 e465 therefore it has great significance to study the cathodic behavior of cf in the ff process 3 3 cathodic corrosion although cathodic corrosion was discovered in the late 1800s by fritz haber it remained mostly unnoticed during the 20th century and has attracted increased attention only in the past decade 24 in this study the low cost and high efficiency of the orr were the main reasons for the use of cf 25 however there is still no reasonable explanation for the instability of cf used as a cathode fig 4a shows the cathodic polarization curves of the cf electrodes 0 to 1 5 v vs sce generally when a saturated calomel electrode sce was used as the reference electrode the orr mainly occurred at 0 7 v vs sce on cf cathode 41 when the potential was more negative than 1 0 v vs sce the electrochemical reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide was less favorable and the hydrogen evolution reaction her mainly occurred eq 3 the reduction peaks generated within the potential range from 0 4 to 0 6 v is continuously observed under deoxygenated atmosphere and an increase in reduction current as a function of the number of cycles this trend will not occur if it was caused by orr from incompletely removed dissolved oxygen moreover in the case of without h2o2 fig 4b the reduction peak was still detected at the same position indicating no interference caused by h2o2 reduction 42 therefore reduction peaks generated within the potential range from 0 4 to 0 6 v were attributed to reductions of carbon species on cf fig 4a remarkably a larger reduction current was observed at the peak for cf corrosion upon the addition of h2o2 fig 4b c the increase in reduction current may be attributed to two factors i the reduction of h2o2 42 and ii the enhancement of cf cathodic corrosion by h2o2 discussed below moreover the tafel curves fig 4d showed that the addition of h2o2 decreased the corrosion potential of the cf cathode and increased the tafel slope implying that the corrosion process had a lower overpotential and the cathode was more susceptible to corrosion under the same dynamic conditions 32 in all cv curves fig 4e due to the thermodynamic instability of cf the oxidation peaks o1 0 48 and 0 68 v vs sce with corresponding reduction peaks r1 0 1 and 0 15 v vs sce were related to the hydroquinone quinone redox couple present on the surface of the cf 43 it is a pair of typical reversible electroactive substances which are often detected in the cv curves of various carbonaceous electrodes 18 40 41 and was not in the potential range of cf corrosion as expected the reduction peaks r2 0 45 and 0 52 v vs sce with no corresponding oxygen peaks were corresponded to the reduction of cf surface species 3 2h aq 2 e h2 g after determining the reduction of carbon species of cf we noticed that a larger reduction current was excited in the presence of h2o2 fig 4b c the enhanced reduction current was thought to come from the electroreduction of intermediates produced by chemical reactions between cf and h2o2 to verify the above hypothesis h2o2 and electricity were controlled as variables respectively to further understand the role of h2o2 during electrolysis as shown in fig 5a an increase in oxygen containing moieties on the cf surface was found when the bulk solution contained h2o2 and no electricity was applied fig 5a indicating a chemical oxidation reaction between h2o2 and carbon species on cf sem with eds mapping revealed similar comparative results oxidation intermediates appeared on the cf surface used in the h2o2 only control experiment fig s4 moreover to further study the corrosion behavior of cf during electrolysis the corrosion potential at 0 6 v vs sce was held constant for 3600 s to enable cathodic polarization for evaluating the corrosion behavior of cf cathode it can be seen from fig 5b and c with the addition of h2o2 the cathodic reduction current of cf increased which was attributed to the continuous electroreduction of chemical oxidation intermediates this corroborates the hypothesis above therefore the tafel curves can be explained as follows fig 4d compared with the control group na2so4 h2o2 the presence of organics cww h2o2 seemed to inhibit cathodic corrosion more effectively so the corrosion potential ecorr was more negative than that of the control group indicating that the thermodynamics of cf corrosion in the presence of organic matter is unfavorable furthermore the corrosion current icorr was smaller in the presence of organic matter fig 4d fig s10 showing an unfavorable kinetic of cf corrosion this was because the organics in cww interfered with the chemical reaction between cf carbon species and h2o2 after cathodic polarization the population of oxygen containing moieties on cf decreased and the peaks clearly disappeared fig 5d the reason was related to the electroreduction of carbon species including those naturally present on cf surface and oxidation intermediates produced by chemical reaction with h2o2 on cf in conclusion h2o2 stimulated the reduction current by consuming carbon species on cf and it indirectly participated in the cf cathodic corrosion process since the main product of the orr on the cf surface is h2o2 41 and the ff process requires additional h2o2 the important role of h2o2 in the cf cathodic corrosion process should not be neglected 3 4 mechanistic analysis and prospects for cf cathode in this study the ff process cf carbon dissolution and cathodic corrosion process can be considered as in fig 6 the plausible pathway of cf cathodic corrosion can be explained from macro and micro aspects respectively first irreversible carbon dissolution will occur in the long term electrolysis process of cf cathode this process is the macroscopic manifestation of cf cathodic corrosion second the corrosion of cf mainly occurs through microscopic electroreduction in this process two kinds of substances are mainly reduced to electroreduction species iii i carbon species that are naturally present on cf surface and ii intermediates produced by chemical reactions with cf and h2o2 as an essential oxidant in the ff process h2o2 indirectly promotes the corrosion process by participating the oxidation of i and iii the participation may eventually led to a reduction in the electrochemical energy barrier for cf cathodic corrosion according to the cathodic reaction potential fig 4 the cathodic reduction sequence on cf can be inferred cf cathodic corrosion o2 reduction orr h2o reduction her furthermore during long term electrolysis in ff process cf cathodic corrosion may lead to the production of unexpected toxic intermediates through reactions between carbon dissolution and oxidizing species fig 2 such as ros 38 45 47 notably although there is h2o2 electrogenerated by cf cathode in imffs its concentration fig s13 is far less than the amount of h2o2 dosage in imffs which indicated the dominant role of the dosage of h2o2 therefore when using cf in the ff process the electrolysis time and the dosage of h2o2 should be considered carefully in fact among the current commercial carbon fiber electrodes there are mainly graphite felt gf and cf the former is treated at a higher temperature usually above 2000 c graphite felt has higher carbon content 99 90 and sp2 c of graphite after high temperature graphitization has obvious chemical inertia therefore it has stronger conductivity and chemical stability when used as electrode in our preliminary comparison it was found that gf did not present cathodic corrosion fig s11 it also displayed an excellent performance that similar to cf 18 20 nevertheless due to the price and performance of cf it still has the advantage of using as a cathode therefore in actual applications if price is a consideration it is suggested that the electrolysis time be optimized to avoid the negative effects of carbon dissolution and cathodic corrosion when considering the long term performance it is recommended to use stable gf as an alternative to cf cathodes 4 conclusions in this study an ff system was constructed and the performance of ff treatment of cww was evaluated more importantly carbon dissolution and cathodic corrosion of cf cathodes were found for the first time based on this phenomenon the effects of these processes were deeply studied including changes of biodegradability acute cytotoxicity and organic matter the cathodic corrosion potential and possible pathways based on the results the following main conclusions were drawn i treatment with a current density of 70 ma cm2 h2o2 dosage of 7 ml 200 ml and initial ph of 3 0 was found to be suitable cww was further treated using the ff process and cod toc and las were reduced to 557 5 mg l 313 5 mg l and 311 2 mg l in 2 h which achieved 65 1 cod removal 49 8 toc removal and 78 5 las removal ii unexpected toxic organic intermediates were found due to excessive electrolysis times soluble carbon accumulated due to cf carbon dissolution which negatively affected biodegradability and cytotoxicity iii cf cathodic corrosion was mainly indicated by the electroreduction of carbon species on cf which was promoted by h2o2 h2o2 indirectly participated in the corrosion process by chemically oxidizing reductive carbon species iv it is necessary to optimize the electrolysis time such as 60 min to avoid the negative effects of carbon dissolution and cathodic corrosion of cf gf may be a better alternative to cf cathodes the findings of this study provide new insight into cf cathodic corrosion and support the application

gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms and cytotoxicity test used in this study are described in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 ff optimization for cww treatment for the treatment of cww using ff process a series of electrochemical configurations were screened fig 1a and b since the current research shows that the acidic environment is conducive to the ef process 13 15 the initial ph is set at 3 0 the h2o2 control experiment showed that oxidation by h2o2 was limited in the absence of fe2 fig 1a and b in general imffs showed the strongest degradation capability predictably it was difficult to remove contaminants rapidly by ao active anodes such as ti ruo2 are difficult to produce free radicals like non active anodes such as born doped diamond anode 27 28 and they tend to produce mox oh with limited oxidation capacity on anode surface m is the catalytic mental in active anodes 29 30 in comparison to the performance of imefs the addition of h2o2 accelerated the pollution removal rates of ao h2o2 imffs no aeration and imffs since h2o2 was not added to the imefs pollution removal was slow and this system may take longer to treat cww most studies have adopted the practice of adding additional h2o2 ff process to treat wastewater 14 15 the cod removal efficiencies of imffs no aeration and imffs were 42 0 and 95 1 higher respectively than that of ao h2o2 fig 1a this result further proves the advantages of iron mesh bipolar electrode actually the free electrons in the iron mesh move along a certain direction under an applied electric field leading to a potential difference on the electrode surface and realizing polarization fig 6 the iron mesh bipolar electrode exhibited electrode characteristics at the corresponding positions i e cathode characteristics at the side near the anode and anode characteristics at the side near the cathode 15 31 therefore the iron mesh bipolar electrode enhanced the performance of the electrochemical system due to its bipolar characteristics and dissolved fe2 fig 1f inset and the electric field in the system was utilized effectively leading to an increase in e sp fig s9 in this study imffs was deemed the optimal system for cww treatment current density is a key operating parameter and it affects the performance of the electrochemical process by controlling the electrochemical reaction rate 28 for this reason the performance of imffs was studied with different current densities as shown in fig 1c the cod removal efficiency at a high current density was significantly higher than that at a low current density this result can be explained by the enhanced ff reaction and the increase in oh concentration controlled by the current density 1 27 1 fe2 h2o2 h fe3 h2o oh 2 h2o2 oh ho2 h2o the ph of the bulk solution has an important influence on the morphology of fe species and the decomposition of h2o2 10 13 15 generally at ph 2 5 the oxidation of organic compounds is inhibited and stable fe h2o 2 complexes are formed this leads to the inactivation of fe2 and the formation of h3o2 from h2o2 and h 10 thus inhibiting the fenton reaction eq 1 a high ph value ph 5 0 is also not conducive to cod removal and will reduce the oxidation potential of oh and produce fe oh n to inactivate fe2 31 to test the effect of ph on the performance of imffs a series of experiments were carried out with initial ph values of 3 0 9 0 fig 1d shows that optimum removal was realized when the initial ph value was 3 0 to obtain suitable acidity and prevent the precipitation of dissolved iron the best ph values were in the range 2 5 3 5 10 13 however pollutants can also be removed by electrocoagulation ec mechanism with fe oh n at ph 7 0 and 9 0 therefore a higher cod removal higher was obtained at a ph value of 9 0 than that of 7 0 fig 1d because it is more conducive to the formation of fe oh n flocculant under alkaline conditions 32 in addition in the ph value range of 4 0 6 0 it is conducive to the fenton reaction and ec occur simultaneously 31 so it still has an acceptable cod removal when ph 5 0 fig 1d excessive h2o2 levels can lead to a scavenging reaction eq 2 several studies have reported the effects of h2o2 concentration on the ff process 1 15 28 as shown in fig 1e although low h2o2 doses 3 ml 200 ml and 5 ml 200 ml significantly improved the removal efficiency of cod the process then entered a plateau which was attributed to insufficient h2o2 content therefore 7 ml 200 ml was deemed the optimal h2o2 dosage for imffs fig 1e under the optimal conditions j 70 ma cm2 initial ph 3 0 h2o2 dosage 7 ml 200 ml 2 h treatment it achieved 65 1 cod removal 49 8 toc removal and 78 5 las removal fig 1f indicating that a high concentration of surfactant can be effectively degraded notably an appropriate h2o2 content was beneficial to the ff system when the concentration of h2o2 exceeded the threshold the utilization efficiency of h2o2 decreased 28 it should be noted that when the h2o2 dose was increased to 9 ml 200 ml the initial removal rate slowed and a cod rise occurred later fig 1e the slowing of the initial removal rate was due to scavenging of oh by h2o2 eq 2 moreover the rise in cod was probably caused by the carbon dissolution of cf cathode so it is necessary to study this phenomenon in depth 3 2 cathode carbon dissolution and changes of organic matter increases in cod and toc concentrations were found in blank electrolyte fig 2a there is no organic matter in the blank electrolyte and only cf cathode contains carbon in the system therefore these increases were attributed to carbon dissolution from cf cathode during electrolysis similar behavior was also observed in previous studies 21 25 even when used as a cathode cf is still corroded due to its thermodynamic instability 21 33 34 in this study we observed that cathodic corrosion of cf mainly resulted in carbon dissolution and changes in surface functional groups figs 2a and s5 different degrees of damage were found in the cf cathodes used in section 3 1 fig s5 which will be discussed below by statistical analysis fig 2b based on the above it is speculated that cf cathode will inevitably affect the evolution of organic matter in the electrolysis process therefore a comparison was made between an insoluble titanium ti cathode with stable physical and chemical properties 2 and a cf cathode fig 3 during electrolysis the biodegradability of cww improved the 5 day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 cod b c of the effluent reached 0 40 and 0 44 with cf and ti cathodes respectively fig 3a notably b c decreased significantly during the period from 60 to 120 min a similar change occurred for cytotoxicity which showed an increase in the inhibition rate fig 3b to determine the changes of organic matter in this process gc ms analyses of the samples were performed at 0 60 and 120 min and the results are shown in fig 3c d macromolecular long chain alkanes were detected in the raw samples 0 min these compounds were mainly white waxy substances which were derived from the water wax used in car washing notably nearly 30 new products were detected under both cf and ti cathode conditions these products were mainly intermediate products resulting from degradation moreover due to quenching of oh by alcohols 35 the dodecanol 14 48 was observed which was probably the product of hydrogen extraction from 1 dodecanol 15 31 fig 3c d however when using cf cathode the presence of the new product 2 4 di t butylphenol 15 73 was the main reason for the reduction in b c and increased cytotoxicity fig 3c 2 4 di t butylphenol fig s3 is a precursor of fine chemical products and has the same properties as most phenolic compounds 36 it damages the cell membranes of activated sludge bacteria after entering a biochemical system causing inhibitory and toxic effects on microorganisms 37 in this study the toxic intermediates were believed to be caused by excessive electrolysis which led to carbon dissolution of cf and reactions with oxidizing species such as reactive oxygen species ros an appropriate electrolysis time e g 60 min allowed further treatment of cww by subsequent microbial processes giving a high b c value and no toxic intermediates fig 3a b therefore the time and intensity of electrolysis control the production of toxic intermediates 38 typical uv spectrum characteristics such as suva254 suva270 and e253 e203 are related to the abundances of aromatics phenols and the number of substituents in the benzene ring 39 e300 e400 and e250 e365 are related to the molecular weight of organic matters while e265 e465 can indicate the number of conjugated unsaturated bonds in organic structure such as co and cc 40 they were selected as the organic evolution indicators with the aforementioned experimental data cod toc las carbon dissolution bod5 cod and cytotoxicity to perform the statistical analysis the relationship between the changes of organic matter and carbon dissolution in the fered fenton treatment process was analyzed by correlation analysis fig s12 the significant statistical correlation indicated that the dimensionality of the above indicators can be reduced by principal component analysis pca fig 2b as a result suva254 suva270 and e253 e203 were closely clustered with the cytotoxicity it meant that the increased cytotoxicity was mainly caused by phenols consistent with the gc ms results and biodegradability was also negatively affected moreover the carbon dissolution of the cathode increased the molecular weight of dissolved organic matter e300 e400 and e250 e365 and may have been mainly responsible for the increase in the number of cc and co bonds e265 e465 therefore it has great significance to study the cathodic behavior of cf in the ff process 3 3 cathodic corrosion although cathodic corrosion was discovered in the late 1800s by fritz haber it remained mostly unnoticed during the 20th century and has attracted increased attention only in the past decade 24 in this study the low cost and high efficiency of the orr were the main reasons for the use of cf 25 however there is still no reasonable explanation for the instability of cf used as a cathode fig 4a shows the cathodic polarization curves of the cf electrodes 0 to 1 5 v vs sce generally when a saturated calomel electrode sce was used as the reference electrode the orr mainly occurred at 0 7 v vs sce on cf cathode 41 when the potential was more negative than 1 0 v vs sce the electrochemical reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide was less favorable and the hydrogen evolution reaction her mainly occurred eq 3 the reduction peaks generated within the potential range from 0 4 to 0 6 v is continuously observed under deoxygenated atmosphere and an increase in reduction current as a function of the number of cycles this trend will not occur if it was caused by orr from incompletely removed dissolved oxygen moreover in the case of without h2o2 fig 4b the reduction peak was still detected at the same position indicating no interference caused by h2o2 reduction 42 therefore reduction peaks generated within the potential range from 0 4 to 0 6 v were attributed to reductions of carbon species on cf fig 4a remarkably a larger reduction current was observed at the peak for cf corrosion upon the addition of h2o2 fig 4b c the increase in reduction current may be attributed to two factors i the reduction of h2o2 42 and ii the enhancement of cf cathodic corrosion by h2o2 discussed below moreover the tafel curves fig 4d showed that the addition of h2o2 decreased the corrosion potential of the cf cathode and increased the tafel slope implying that the corrosion process had a lower overpotential and the cathode was more susceptible to corrosion under the same dynamic conditions 32 in all cv curves fig 4e due to the thermodynamic instability of cf the oxidation peaks o1 0 48 and 0 68 v vs sce with corresponding reduction peaks r1 0 1 and 0 15 v vs sce were related to the hydroquinone quinone redox couple present on the surface of the cf 43 it is a pair of typical reversible electroactive substances which are often detected in the cv curves of various carbonaceous electrodes 18 40 41 and was not in the potential range of cf corrosion as expected the reduction peaks r2 0 45 and 0 52 v vs sce with no corresponding oxygen peaks were corresponded to the reduction of cf surface species 3 2h aq 2 e h2 g after determining the reduction of carbon species of cf we noticed that a larger reduction current was excited in the presence of h2o2 fig 4b c the enhanced reduction current was thought to come from the electroreduction of intermediates produced by chemical reactions between cf and h2o2 to verify the above hypothesis h2o2 and electricity were controlled as variables respectively to further understand the role of h2o2 during electrolysis as shown in fig 5a an increase in oxygen containing moieties on the cf surface was found when the bulk solution contained h2o2 and no electricity was applied fig 5a indicating a chemical oxidation reaction between h2o2 and carbon species on cf sem with eds mapping revealed similar comparative results oxidation intermediates appeared on the cf surface used in the h2o2 only control experiment fig s4 moreover to further study the corrosion behavior of cf during electrolysis the corrosion potential at 0 6 v vs sce was held constant for 3600 s to enable cathodic polarization for evaluating the corrosion behavior of cf cathode it can be seen from fig 5b and c with the addition of h2o2 the cathodic reduction current of cf increased which was attributed to the continuous electroreduction of chemical oxidation intermediates this corroborates the hypothesis above therefore the tafel curves can be explained as follows fig 4d compared with the control group na2so4 h2o2 the presence of organics cww h2o2 seemed to inhibit cathodic corrosion more effectively so the corrosion potential ecorr was more negative than that of the control group indicating that the thermodynamics of cf corrosion in the presence of organic matter is unfavorable furthermore the corrosion current icorr was smaller in the presence of organic matter fig 4d fig s10 showing an unfavorable kinetic of cf corrosion this was because the organics in cww interfered with the chemical reaction between cf carbon species and h2o2 after cathodic polarization the population of oxygen containing moieties on cf decreased and the peaks clearly disappeared fig 5d the reason was related to the electroreduction of carbon species including those naturally present on cf surface and oxidation intermediates produced by chemical reaction with h2o2 on cf in conclusion h2o2 stimulated the reduction current by consuming carbon species on cf and it indirectly participated in the cf cathodic corrosion process since the main product of the orr on the cf surface is h2o2 41 and the ff process requires additional h2o2 the important role of h2o2 in the cf cathodic corrosion process should not be neglected 3 4 mechanistic analysis and prospects for cf cathode in this study the ff process cf carbon dissolution and cathodic corrosion process can be considered as in fig 6 the plausible pathway of cf cathodic corrosion can be explained from macro and micro aspects respectively first irreversible carbon dissolution will occur in the long term electrolysis process of cf cathode this process is the macroscopic manifestation of cf cathodic corrosion second the corrosion of cf mainly occurs through microscopic electroreduction in this process two kinds of substances are mainly reduced to electroreduction species iii i carbon species that are naturally present on cf surface and ii intermediates produced by chemical reactions with cf and h2o2 as an essential oxidant in the ff process h2o2 indirectly promotes the corrosion process by participating the oxidation of i and iii the participation may eventually led to a reduction in the electrochemical energy barrier for cf cathodic corrosion according to the cathodic reaction potential fig 4 the cathodic reduction sequence on cf can be inferred cf cathodic corrosion o2 reduction orr h2o reduction her furthermore during long term electrolysis in ff process cf cathodic corrosion may lead to the production of unexpected toxic intermediates through reactions between carbon dissolution and oxidizing species fig 2 such as ros 38 45 47 notably although there is h2o2 electrogenerated by cf cathode in imffs its concentration fig s13 is far less than the amount of h2o2 dosage in imffs which indicated the dominant role of the dosage of h2o2 therefore when using cf in the ff process the electrolysis time and the dosage of h2o2 should be considered carefully in fact among the current commercial carbon fiber electrodes there are mainly graphite felt gf and cf the former is treated at a higher temperature usually above 2000 c graphite felt has higher carbon content 99 90 and sp2 c of graphite after high temperature graphitization has obvious chemical inertia therefore it has stronger conductivity and chemical stability when used as electrode in our preliminary comparison it was found that gf did not present cathodic corrosion fig s11 it also displayed an excellent performance that similar to cf 18 20 nevertheless due to the price and performance of cf it still has the advantage of using as a cathode therefore in actual applications if price is a consideration it is suggested that the electrolysis time be optimized to avoid the negative effects of carbon dissolution and cathodic corrosion when considering the long term performance it is recommended to use stable gf as an alternative to cf cathodes 4 conclusions in this study an ff system was constructed and the performance of ff treatment of cww was evaluated more importantly carbon dissolution and cathodic corrosion of cf cathodes were found for the first time based on this phenomenon the effects of these processes were deeply studied including changes of biodegradability acute cytotoxicity and organic matter the cathodic corrosion potential and possible pathways based on the results the following main conclusions were drawn i treatment with a current density of 70 ma cm2 h2o2 dosage of 7 ml 200 ml and initial ph of 3 0 was found to be suitable cww was further treated using the ff process and cod toc and las were reduced to 557 5 mg l 313 5 mg l and 311 2 mg l in 2 h which achieved 65 1 cod removal 49 8 toc removal and 78 5 las removal ii unexpected toxic organic intermediates were found due to excessive electrolysis times soluble carbon accumulated due to cf carbon dissolution which negatively affected biodegradability and cytotoxicity iii cf cathodic corrosion was mainly indicated by the electroreduction of carbon species on cf which was promoted by h2o2 h2o2 indirectly participated in the corrosion process by chemically oxidizing reductive carbon species iv it is necessary to optimize the electrolysis time such as 60 min to avoid the negative effects of carbon dissolution and cathodic corrosion of cf gf may be a better alternative to cf cathodes the findings of this study provide new insight into cf cathodic corrosion and support the application

12801,billions of microplastics mps eliminated during wastewater treatment are prone to be found in sewage sludge which would lead to dynamic redistribution of these particles in agricultural soils and consequently to the uptake and remobilization of various pollutants as far as we know there is limited information on mps in sludge from spanish wastewater treatment plants wwtps in this study their abundance during primary and secondary treatments in four wwtps was investigated in two samplings in a southern nationwide area combining shape size and chemical composition we discussed the reasons for the existence of mp sizes 100 μm as well as an estimate of the annual emission of each polymer from land application mp concentrations in sludge samples ranged from 96 to 769 particles g dry sludge with an average of 392 4 72 01 particles g dry sludge microparticles in the shape of fibres are the most common type ranged between 100 and 355 μm fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir showed that most mps belonged to thermoplastics ethylene derivatives polyethylene terephthalate and polyamide based on the total sewage sludge production in spain the average amount of mps derived from sewage sludge that could enter the soil was estimated to be 2 80 1014 mps year the results confirmed that dry sludge is one of the potential sources of mps contamination in the terrestrial

quantities of plastic waste enter the environment in general and the aquatic ecosystem in particular where they gradually accumulate and fragment in convergence areas 1 given their low biodegradability and fate in the environment it is very important to know the impact of these small particles dubbed microplastics mps smaller than 5 mm on the flora and fauna of ecosystems 2 also they can be classified as secondary stemming from the degradation of larger plastics or primary originally produced at this size such as the microbeads used in toiletries and pose a threat to aquatic ecosystems due to their longevity and resilience 3 according to preliminary estimates the sources from which the majority of wastes enter the environment albeit with significant regional variations include carelessly conducted and managed landfills riverbank transport industrial plants facilities without adequate controls wind borne wastes use of coastal areas for recreational purposes tourism activities sewage and stormwater discharges 4 6 several studies agree that municipal wastewater treatment plants or sewage treatment plant effluents are considered as an important pathway for mps into the aquatic environment 7 14 85 and many agree that mps can be retained in wastewater and then transferred to sludge which has implications for agricultural soil when used as fertiliser 15 16 so far the first works that revealed this problem began from 2019 at this moment there are about 26 works focused on the study of mps in the most common wwtp sludge treatment technologies in terms of their characterization table 1 hence the spanish regulatory decree aaa 1072 2013 use of sewage sludge in agriculture still did not contemplate mps from sewage sludge as a pollutant at that time when it was not suspected that these pollutants may be accumulating in agricultural land the results of sun et al 37 suggest that most mps including fragments end up in sewage sludge at concentrations 15 times higher than in effluent the amount of sewage sludge spread as fertiliser varies considerably experts claim that in north america and europe 50 of sewage sludge is reused while in spain 65 is reprocessed 38 39 they estimate that between 110 000 and 730 000 t of mps are applied to agricultural soils each year either directly or enriched with biosolids which is far more than the estimated amount present in the oceans 40 according to iqbal et al 41 mps interact with soil and microbial activity disrupt nitrogen cycling and can significantly limit antibiotic uptake nationally a recent study examined plastic pollution in agricultural fields in southern spain where plastic mulch is commonly used and the ingestion of plastic by sheep from different flocks it was found that 2 103 particles kg 1 were found in the soil and 103 particles kg 1 in the livestock feces proving that plastic mulch is often not completely removed from fields after harvest 42 studies on the spread of mps in soils via sewage sludge have shown that mps drive soil contamination as with a median value of 34 particles g 1 the number successively increases with each application of sewage sludge 19 there is a recent strategy on microplastics mps from the european commission a european strategy for plastics in a circular economy focused on different measures for prevention at source the plastics industry both in production and in the manufacture of finished products is asked to behave responsibly taking into account the problem of mps thus the recent european directive 2019 904 in relation with the reduction of impact of certain plastic products on the environment single use plastics is going to represent an undoubted impulse to the restriction of the generation of all kinds of plastics therefore this study aims to investigate the presence of mps in conventional sewage sludge representative of different urban populations in southern spain estimating the annual amount of polymers generated the presence is investigated based on the quantity size shape and type of mps in the sewage sludge which is subsequently used as agricultural fertiliser this is intended to demonstrate the importance of pollution prevention measures to limit exposure to mps and may serve to provide the competent administrations with reasons to control and reduce the use of plastic products in general 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the province of cádiz is located in the extreme southwest of spain and has about 1 250 000 inhabitants 7435 km2 it is a coastal region that receives a large number of tourists during the holiday season and the population can easily double or triple which inevitably leads to an increase in the pollutant load discharged into the wastewater in order to make a representative study of the sewage sludge generated in the area four urban wwtps in the province were analysed representing the most common sewage sludge treatment technologies conventional treatment receiving wastewater from the largest populations between 11 000 and 300 000 inhab eq and producing 50 of the sewage sludge generated in the area table 2 provides an overview of the treatment plants 2 2 sampling and sludge processing to obtain the best separation of mps from sludge many methods and reagents were compared in a previous study 43 sludge samples 500 g 79 7 3 4 moisture content were collected during winter and autumn 2020 as well as 2021 all samples were taken twice 1 2 first and second sampling respectively and processed in replicates from each location along with procedural and background blanks primary sludge was sampled after the primary settler p and secondary sludge was grabbed before the dewatering process at the end of the sludge treatment line in the wwtps j c ch while m was sampled before the final dehydration process s due to its limited facilities fig 1 the different treatment capacities population equivalent influent composition and water treatment of both facilities are shown in table 2 the sludge samples were transported in laboratory containers and kept frozen 4 c until the time of their analysis after thawing they were dried at room temperature the final procedure consisted of pre treatment for digestion extraction and filtration for digestion roughly 2 g wet weight was added to hemicellulase enzyme 5 ml sigma aldrich and shaken in a platform shaker at 40 rpm for 24 h followed by 30 h2o2 20 ml itw reagents allowed to react for 24 h without fear of synthetic degradation 43 the supernatant was then filtered through a simple stack of four 8 inc diameter stainless steel sieves with different mesh sizes 1000 500 355 and 100 μm which is the typical range detected in many previous research 34 44 do van et al 2022 the material retained on the steel sieves was rinsed in beakers with ultrapure water and transferred to a polycarbonate filter pc 47 mmø 0 8 μm isopore the filters were dried at 40 c for 2 h before microplastic identification and quantification in addition several blanks without samples were run during the analysis to detect any contamination after organic digestion the mps were characterized based on their physical and chemical properties 2 3 measurement techniques and dataset the filters containing the captured objects were examined with a carl zeiss stereomicroscope and camera the observed particles were classified according to their morphology 26 into fibre bulk also referred to granular by 6 and fragment as shown in fig 2 nile red stained particles from each sample were initially inspected under the microscope and any fibres with high dye affinity were removed the typology of mps was determined using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir spectrum 100 perkinelmer usa the particles were manually removed from the filters and pressed onto the diamond crystal of the atr accessory an absorption spectrum 4000 650 cm 1 with a resolution of 4 cm 1 was obtained based on 16 scans the perkinelmer software compared the characterized results with reference spectra from the integrated library only comparison results with a degree of agreement 70 were considered valid 86 2 4 contamination mitigation blank samples i e negative controls were included at all sample processing steps to quantify potential background contamination with plastics e g air contamination and chemicals used in sample processing blank samples in the laboratory included clean empty beakers that were placed next to the beakers containing the actual samples and processed using the same method as the sludge samples other preventive measures that were maintained included rinsing all materials and glassware with ultrapure water three times before use and covering with watch glass after each step cleaning all instruments materials and equipment with alcohol 96 v v usp bp ph eur 3 results and discussion the results of this study are ordered starting with the morphological characteristics size distribution polymer abundance and removal efficiency of the studied wwtps 3 1 morphology characteristics of the microparticles table 3 shows the mean value and standard deviation of the two samplings of each wwtp for primary and secondary sludges fibres constituted the major fraction in all the wwtps 345 55 110 81 particles g according to the studies mentioned by other authors 6 19 33 45 48 both forms bulk and fragment were found in a very similar mean values 24 84 12 81 and 24 08 14 57 particles g respectively this phenomenon of dissimilarity was consistent with a study for mps from sewage sludge 26 previous studies have shown that fibrous mps in sewage mainly from washing textiles and wet wipes 6 49 52 while fragments and bulks may originate from daily care products and cosmetics among others 5 53 according to percentage distribution fig 3 again fibres were predominant 87 28 4 29 while lower amounts of bulk and fragment 6 2 6 6 3 89 were recorded in j the number of particles in the secondary sludge js was slightly lower but the opposite was true in ch where there were more particles at the outlet but in c this difference was much greater according to our results secondary treatment did not reduce the particle concentration when the number of treatment steps is reduced 52 the retention capacity of particles in j was 11 75 while ch and c were important reservoirs of fibres stuck in a vicious cycle as a retention value way less than other authors 54 87 it can be stated that besides its complex and organic rich properties the lipidic fraction of sewage sludge might influence particle retention capacity because of their hydrophobic properties and mobility 55 with regard to the form of the particles we found that fragments and bulks were easily trapped during primary treatment as they have a relatively larger surface area to volume ratio and are more prone to flocculation and settling after the primary treatment process most of the easily settled or skimmed particles were dislodged but the remainder exhibited a neutral buoyancy case of j wwtp other particles were easily trapped during secondary treatment processes the fibres with low density were easily removed by flotation and grease removal processes on the other hand the fibres with high density generally sank to the bottom of pools due to gravity case of c and ch wwtps which is not a new revelation 56 57 in general there was little difference between the amounts found in primary and secondary sludge in fact the secondary treatment reduced 3 09 of the bulks and 3 47 of the fragments while the fibre concentration surprisingly increased by 6 56 in all treatment systems the fact that the secondary treatment was able to remove more fragments than fibres is consistent 27 comparing the amount of discharged particles mean i 1 n js cs chs ms 421 88 150 53 particles g 1 with the amount of initial flux mean i 1 n jp cp chp 358 10 157 63 particles g 1 table 3 it seems that the particles which were still introduced into the plants with the influent accumulate during the primary treatment stages mainly due to skimming and settling processes 5 27 58 otherwise the suspicious plastic particles count maximum diameter and shape might deform through shear forces on the breakage of larger pieces 11 59 60 more data about microparticles concentration in size detected in the two samplings separately are provided in support information table si 1 our results suggest that the number of particles increases in wwtps with successive absorption of the sludge load i e a concentration of particles was observed throughout the treatment process among the 4 wwtps analysed the highest particulate matter concentration detected belonged to cs secondary sludge the other wwtps had a mean value of 394 115 4 particles g 1 in a similar range as previously reported by chinese and thai studies 27 33 however our study exceeds the data reported by authors from other countries finland italy and australia with lowest reported mean concentrations of 186 7 26 170 9 28 7 112 8 56 89 31 1 14 9 mps g dw respectively 6 29 58 61 table 1 3 2 size distribution across sewage treatment systems the predominant size of particles ranged from 100 to 335 μm and larger particles accounted for less than 15 in all wwtps this possibly indicates a break up of particles during sludge treatment 23 which would no doubt have important implications for fate and mps risk in terrestrial ecosystems 62 leading to nanoplastics release inducing cellular toxicity 63 64 the lack of particles larger than 1000 μm suggests that conventional treatment in cádiz wwtps is efficient in removing large mps a result consistent with studies 37 65 66 the second most common particle size was in the 1000 500 μm range and accounted for 25 on average support information table si 2 studies but the last confirmed that particles larger than 500 μm were almost absent in the secondary treatment 52 61 65 67 considering the breakthrough of sludge from the secondary aeration tanks assuming that the effluent water passes through the same filtration sieve set franco et al 44 found the same dominant size distribution with a 1000 μm mesh sieve stacked atop 500 355 and 100 μm mesh sieves most previous studies have used different sieves ranging from 100 μm to 5000 μm 25 28 68 72 all samples contained fibres bulks and to a lesser extent fragments at the primary treatment secondary treatment showed an increase in fragments with a concomitant absence of bulk possibly due to chemicals such as polyelectrolyte or other flocculants used in secondary treatment that could negatively impact mps removal by causing suspended particles to coalesce into a flocculation 73 at one site js1 particles were absent with fibres and 30 fragments predominating in the largest size class two sites jp2 chp2 lacked fibres with 97 in the 1000 500 μm size class otherwise both wwtps evacuated a total 300 particles g 194 47 of different size classes table si 2 including the previously missing 1000 500 μm class with 28 19 26 13 confirming our doubts larger size classes were most often dominated by fibres and fragments post treatment as in the study by sutton et al 74 unlike primary treatment secondary treatment removed more bulks in all wwtps probably because they have a larger surface area and are more neutrally buoyant particles unlike high density fibres which can escape both the skimming and settling processes 26 37 our results differ from those of some previous studies in which the particles found were divided into three forms fibre bulk or granular and fragment in terms of the removal rate of mps the relative abundance of fragments decreased while that of fibres increased after secondary treatment 37 52 li et al 16 26 zhang and liu 75 found bulk to be the dominant form in greenhouse soils probably due to mulching in contrast few bulks were found throughout the treatment chain 6 the only consistency in this study is that the loading of mps in the digested stabilised sludge after primary and secondary treatments was elevated compared to that in the reclaimed water due to fragments and fibres one possible reason for this is that the fragments and fibres that were easily settled or skimmed off were largely removed during primary treatment while the residuals may have more resistance to be removed further the high fractions removed from wastewater and retained in sludge during sewage treatment were related to the specific microplastic removal efficiency achieved by different secondary treatment technologies with different operating conditions sewage type and population equivalences of each wwtp which require further attention 45 almost all of the particles that came from the primary treatment from the wwtps studied j2 c1 2 and ch2 were embedded in the treatment process at all scales in order jp2 greatly improved the elimination of particles with the largest and smallest sizes except for the 1000 500 μm range c1 2 had a different effect in the two samplings table si 2 cp1 contributed to 23 removal for the 3 size classes but all remained stuck in the 1000 500 μm range cp2 removed 35 from the largest and smallest classes chp2 was not efficient in the middle 1000 355 μm ranges likely due to the fact that sludge had much organic matter which made it difficult to release the middle particles in suspension due to lack of air 18 26 76 j1 and ch1 achieved lower secondary discharges than the primary jp1 acted as chp2 and removed 100 of particles whose size was 5000 μm ch1 is the only wwtp that reduced particles 1000 μm to more than half of the particles in the primary treatment although small particles may have been blocked in the fine grids because what survived the 1000 500 μm range in the coarse grids entered the fine ones 36 comparing the percentage size distribution of m with the mean value of each wwtp fig 4 it is not clear for the discharges of the largest and smallest classes whether the wwtp was able to eliminate or intercept the particles especially since the values obtained by it were the highest compared to the other wwtps as for the medium class m seems to have largely eliminated the particles achieving percentages close to those of the others in summary j was efficient at 5000 1000 and 355 100 μm removing fibres but accumulating fragments c acted about the same and kept the load stable at 500 355 μm removing bulks and fragments but accumulating fibres significantly ch eliminated particles in the 5000 1000 1000 500 μm ranges where it was the only clarifier to be successful and 355 100 μm while loading the 500 355 μm range with 9 fibres 3 3 polymer features analysis by ft ir ft ir analysis was performed for 52 of the particles 2666 pieces in total that were selected and analysed support information fig si 1 reference to particles was attributed to unknown items that were quantified by visual sorting prior to ft ir analysis few suspect mps were detected in the laboratory blanks this could be due to minor atmospheric contamination in the form of white cellulose fibres analysed using ft ir the discarded particles belonged to adhesives polyhydroxyalkanoates and those that came out with a lower matching score 70 after ft ir correctly identified the polymers fig 5 support information fig si 2 the particles are classified as synthetic or additives 17 this study confirms their persistence throughout the treatment line as they were present in all samples while tpe was the predominant polymer at all sampling sites except cp the distribution of the others was very uneven the abundance of tpe can be attributed to its high density 1 06 g cm 3 which allows it to be overrepresented in the sludge while the ethylene derivatives pp pet ptfe pvc ps mostly originating from toys coating materials for cookware general purposes and hoses were mostly reduced in the secondary treatment the only wwtp that gave contrasting results as ldpe and pvc increased was jp fig 6 this difference in results can be explained by the relationship between the accumulation time of mps in the plant and the daily distribution of flow entering the wwtp j 6 77 as it has been reported that the abundance and distribution of mps may vary depending on flow and location the polyesters pes pet and pcl originating from food packaging and medical applications were more resistant jp and cp failed pes and pet elimination respectively however the latter removed 54 of pet no treatment plant eliminated pcl polyamide pa commonly made into textile fibres thermoplastics tpu tpe used in sports equipment and for thermal insulation of household appliances silicone and synthetic cellulose widely used in dentistry and paper fibre production made it clear that chp could not remove pa and cellulose tpe and silicone performed better in secondary treatment comparing these results with other studies we note that the frequency of mps in this study 233 6 69 2 mps g dw was similar to those reported in dry weight units elsewhere table 1 24 27 30 however as there is not yet a standard protocol for microplastic analysis a deep comparison with other reports was difficult to further support the previous statement many studies used different anodisc filters and sieve sizes with different criteria in a cross comparison with one study that used the same sieve sizes the main components reported in the effluent 44 were ethylene derivatives which were second only to tpe in the sludge samples implying that the polymer composition in the secondary sludge often mirrors the corresponding regenerated water samples 6 except pp and pe all polymers found in our study have a higher density than regenerated water and should sink 88 in agreement with laboratory studies 87 of the fibres retained in sludge could be dependent on the chance of catching in each sample naturally polymer composition and sludge sample size are interconnected therefore the fibres exhibit the same behaviour as the sludge 78 acting in principle as static pollutant carriers trace elements when pollutants arrive in situ and become trapped over time the mps including fibres with sludge become dynamic microcosms where the microorganisms interact and carry out cometabolism and amensalism leading to the chemicals degradation without energy gain and inhibition of other populations that may colonize the habitat 79 3 4 emission estimates of mps through wwtps no differences were found in the average amounts of mps g in primary and secondary treatments for the 4 wwtps studied and the two samplings carried out 233 6 69 2 mps g p and 230 9 88 0 mps g s again confirming that these particles extracted from the water line leave the wwtps through the sludge without undergoing quantitative changes considering the annual tonnes in the form of dry sludge they report average amounts of 2 34 108 mps t which corresponds to 3 16 1012 mps year according to the national sewage sludge register about 1 200 000 t of sewage sludge in dry matter m s are produced annually in spain taking into account 2 34 108 mps t this would give a quantity of 2 80 1014 mps year in spain with reference to polymer type tpe pet pp pa and ldpe fig 7 were the major polymers detected in all sludge samples with concentrations dry weight ranging from 44 to 235 particles g median of 109 particles g 14 105 particles g median of 45 particles g 0 47 particles g median of 15 particles g 0 39 particles g median of 13 particles g and 1 30 particles g median of 16 particles g respectively the concentrations of each polymer varied depending on the treatment capacity of the wwtps 24 35 the annual environmental emission of mps from sludge disposal in spain was estimated to be 1 4 1014 t year for tpe 45 5 1 1013 t year for pet 16 1 7 1013 t year for pp 7 and 1 3 1013 t year for pa 7 the polymers in intermediate percentage were ldpe 6 1 0 1013 t year and pes 5 9 1 1012 t year other polymers in minor percentage were ps 1 3 hdpe 1 2 tpu 1 2 and ptfe 0 9 and their estimation was 8 1 1012 t year few studies have assessed national estimates only geyer et al 80 and kawecki nowack 89 were in accordance and cited the same polymer types ft ir spectra of the aforementioned polymers are shown in fig 5 the lack of more detailed geospatial information on the wwtps precluded due to the need to preserve the anonymity of the sampling sites further analysis of the estimated emissions of mps from the application of sewage sludge as fertiliser 3 5 method limitations logically these estimates have certain limitations since there is still no standardized method for the study of mps in sewage sludge and therefore it is not possible to make a good comparison with previous studies a low cost but time consuming method of extraction and identification of mps was selected as demonstrated in a previous study 43 however in addition to the fact that there is no generalized protocol for analysing mps microplastic identification remains an arbitrary procedure in which human error could have resulted in false positives this study type serves to give visualization of the large quantities of mps that could be contaminating our agricultural soils in fact a study on mps quantity in nationwide soils will be launched as a future research line the behaviour of mps in terrestrial environmental compartments is a difficult but essential task to understand the fate of plastic in the environment in general only public administrations through the revision of technical regulations for the application of sludge and compost on agricultural soils can establish threshold values for this emerging pollutant in future revisions 4 conclusion this study has reported the presence of mps in conventional sewage sludge from southern spain which can reach agricultural soils for amendment as it is a practice supported by state regulations as for the predominant form of microparticles it was found that fibres trapped by the sedimentation process in primary and secondary treatments were more visible and countable as confirmed by zeiss microscopy and spectral detection than bulks and fragments it is difficult to determine the exact origin of fibrous mps in addition this study aimed to detect particles in the size range below 500 μm as few data were available from previous sludge studies and the predominant particle size was found to be between 100 and 335 μm as in the wastewater study from the same province the predominant polymer type was expected to be tpe due to the diversity and strength of thermoplastic rubber products in contrast the polymer types pcl pa pes ldpe and silicone were found in high concentrations after secondary treatment in this study which can be explained by a large number of fibres and a value of 2 34 108 mps tonne of dry sludge was estimated to be deposited in soils from the 4 wwtps under study this would give an amount of 2 80 1014 mps year in spain this raises the question of the importance of adopting measures to control these pollutants during treatment in conventional wwtps in order to avoid their dispersion into the terrestrial environment credit authorship contribution statement ayda sakali conceptualization investigation methodology formal analysis

12801,billions of microplastics mps eliminated during wastewater treatment are prone to be found in sewage sludge which would lead to dynamic redistribution of these particles in agricultural soils and consequently to the uptake and remobilization of various pollutants as far as we know there is limited information on mps in sludge from spanish wastewater treatment plants wwtps in this study their abundance during primary and secondary treatments in four wwtps was investigated in two samplings in a southern nationwide area combining shape size and chemical composition we discussed the reasons for the existence of mp sizes 100 μm as well as an estimate of the annual emission of each polymer from land application mp concentrations in sludge samples ranged from 96 to 769 particles g dry sludge with an average of 392 4 72 01 particles g dry sludge microparticles in the shape of fibres are the most common type ranged between 100 and 355 μm fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir showed that most mps belonged to thermoplastics ethylene derivatives polyethylene terephthalate and polyamide based on the total sewage sludge production in spain the average amount of mps derived from sewage sludge that could enter the soil was estimated to be 2 80 1014 mps year the results confirmed that dry sludge is one of the potential sources of mps contamination in the terrestrial

quantities of plastic waste enter the environment in general and the aquatic ecosystem in particular where they gradually accumulate and fragment in convergence areas 1 given their low biodegradability and fate in the environment it is very important to know the impact of these small particles dubbed microplastics mps smaller than 5 mm on the flora and fauna of ecosystems 2 also they can be classified as secondary stemming from the degradation of larger plastics or primary originally produced at this size such as the microbeads used in toiletries and pose a threat to aquatic ecosystems due to their longevity and resilience 3 according to preliminary estimates the sources from which the majority of wastes enter the environment albeit with significant regional variations include carelessly conducted and managed landfills riverbank transport industrial plants facilities without adequate controls wind borne wastes use of coastal areas for recreational purposes tourism activities sewage and stormwater discharges 4 6 several studies agree that municipal wastewater treatment plants or sewage treatment plant effluents are considered as an important pathway for mps into the aquatic environment 7 14 85 and many agree that mps can be retained in wastewater and then transferred to sludge which has implications for agricultural soil when used as fertiliser 15 16 so far the first works that revealed this problem began from 2019 at this moment there are about 26 works focused on the study of mps in the most common wwtp sludge treatment technologies in terms of their characterization table 1 hence the spanish regulatory decree aaa 1072 2013 use of sewage sludge in agriculture still did not contemplate mps from sewage sludge as a pollutant at that time when it was not suspected that these pollutants may be accumulating in agricultural land the results of sun et al 37 suggest that most mps including fragments end up in sewage sludge at concentrations 15 times higher than in effluent the amount of sewage sludge spread as fertiliser varies considerably experts claim that in north america and europe 50 of sewage sludge is reused while in spain 65 is reprocessed 38 39 they estimate that between 110 000 and 730 000 t of mps are applied to agricultural soils each year either directly or enriched with biosolids which is far more than the estimated amount present in the oceans 40 according to iqbal et al 41 mps interact with soil and microbial activity disrupt nitrogen cycling and can significantly limit antibiotic uptake nationally a recent study examined plastic pollution in agricultural fields in southern spain where plastic mulch is commonly used and the ingestion of plastic by sheep from different flocks it was found that 2 103 particles kg 1 were found in the soil and 103 particles kg 1 in the livestock feces proving that plastic mulch is often not completely removed from fields after harvest 42 studies on the spread of mps in soils via sewage sludge have shown that mps drive soil contamination as with a median value of 34 particles g 1 the number successively increases with each application of sewage sludge 19 there is a recent strategy on microplastics mps from the european commission a european strategy for plastics in a circular economy focused on different measures for prevention at source the plastics industry both in production and in the manufacture of finished products is asked to behave responsibly taking into account the problem of mps thus the recent european directive 2019 904 in relation with the reduction of impact of certain plastic products on the environment single use plastics is going to represent an undoubted impulse to the restriction of the generation of all kinds of plastics therefore this study aims to investigate the presence of mps in conventional sewage sludge representative of different urban populations in southern spain estimating the annual amount of polymers generated the presence is investigated based on the quantity size shape and type of mps in the sewage sludge which is subsequently used as agricultural fertiliser this is intended to demonstrate the importance of pollution prevention measures to limit exposure to mps and may serve to provide the competent administrations with reasons to control and reduce the use of plastic products in general 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the province of cádiz is located in the extreme southwest of spain and has about 1 250 000 inhabitants 7435 km2 it is a coastal region that receives a large number of tourists during the holiday season and the population can easily double or triple which inevitably leads to an increase in the pollutant load discharged into the wastewater in order to make a representative study of the sewage sludge generated in the area four urban wwtps in the province were analysed representing the most common sewage sludge treatment technologies conventional treatment receiving wastewater from the largest populations between 11 000 and 300 000 inhab eq and producing 50 of the sewage sludge generated in the area table 2 provides an overview of the treatment plants 2 2 sampling and sludge processing to obtain the best separation of mps from sludge many methods and reagents were compared in a previous study 43 sludge samples 500 g 79 7 3 4 moisture content were collected during winter and autumn 2020 as well as 2021 all samples were taken twice 1 2 first and second sampling respectively and processed in replicates from each location along with procedural and background blanks primary sludge was sampled after the primary settler p and secondary sludge was grabbed before the dewatering process at the end of the sludge treatment line in the wwtps j c ch while m was sampled before the final dehydration process s due to its limited facilities fig 1 the different treatment capacities population equivalent influent composition and water treatment of both facilities are shown in table 2 the sludge samples were transported in laboratory containers and kept frozen 4 c until the time of their analysis after thawing they were dried at room temperature the final procedure consisted of pre treatment for digestion extraction and filtration for digestion roughly 2 g wet weight was added to hemicellulase enzyme 5 ml sigma aldrich and shaken in a platform shaker at 40 rpm for 24 h followed by 30 h2o2 20 ml itw reagents allowed to react for 24 h without fear of synthetic degradation 43 the supernatant was then filtered through a simple stack of four 8 inc diameter stainless steel sieves with different mesh sizes 1000 500 355 and 100 μm which is the typical range detected in many previous research 34 44 do van et al 2022 the material retained on the steel sieves was rinsed in beakers with ultrapure water and transferred to a polycarbonate filter pc 47 mmø 0 8 μm isopore the filters were dried at 40 c for 2 h before microplastic identification and quantification in addition several blanks without samples were run during the analysis to detect any contamination after organic digestion the mps were characterized based on their physical and chemical properties 2 3 measurement techniques and dataset the filters containing the captured objects were examined with a carl zeiss stereomicroscope and camera the observed particles were classified according to their morphology 26 into fibre bulk also referred to granular by 6 and fragment as shown in fig 2 nile red stained particles from each sample were initially inspected under the microscope and any fibres with high dye affinity were removed the typology of mps was determined using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir spectrum 100 perkinelmer usa the particles were manually removed from the filters and pressed onto the diamond crystal of the atr accessory an absorption spectrum 4000 650 cm 1 with a resolution of 4 cm 1 was obtained based on 16 scans the perkinelmer software compared the characterized results with reference spectra from the integrated library only comparison results with a degree of agreement 70 were considered valid 86 2 4 contamination mitigation blank samples i e negative controls were included at all sample processing steps to quantify potential background contamination with plastics e g air contamination and chemicals used in sample processing blank samples in the laboratory included clean empty beakers that were placed next to the beakers containing the actual samples and processed using the same method as the sludge samples other preventive measures that were maintained included rinsing all materials and glassware with ultrapure water three times before use and covering with watch glass after each step cleaning all instruments materials and equipment with alcohol 96 v v usp bp ph eur 3 results and discussion the results of this study are ordered starting with the morphological characteristics size distribution polymer abundance and removal efficiency of the studied wwtps 3 1 morphology characteristics of the microparticles table 3 shows the mean value and standard deviation of the two samplings of each wwtp for primary and secondary sludges fibres constituted the major fraction in all the wwtps 345 55 110 81 particles g according to the studies mentioned by other authors 6 19 33 45 48 both forms bulk and fragment were found in a very similar mean values 24 84 12 81 and 24 08 14 57 particles g respectively this phenomenon of dissimilarity was consistent with a study for mps from sewage sludge 26 previous studies have shown that fibrous mps in sewage mainly from washing textiles and wet wipes 6 49 52 while fragments and bulks may originate from daily care products and cosmetics among others 5 53 according to percentage distribution fig 3 again fibres were predominant 87 28 4 29 while lower amounts of bulk and fragment 6 2 6 6 3 89 were recorded in j the number of particles in the secondary sludge js was slightly lower but the opposite was true in ch where there were more particles at the outlet but in c this difference was much greater according to our results secondary treatment did not reduce the particle concentration when the number of treatment steps is reduced 52 the retention capacity of particles in j was 11 75 while ch and c were important reservoirs of fibres stuck in a vicious cycle as a retention value way less than other authors 54 87 it can be stated that besides its complex and organic rich properties the lipidic fraction of sewage sludge might influence particle retention capacity because of their hydrophobic properties and mobility 55 with regard to the form of the particles we found that fragments and bulks were easily trapped during primary treatment as they have a relatively larger surface area to volume ratio and are more prone to flocculation and settling after the primary treatment process most of the easily settled or skimmed particles were dislodged but the remainder exhibited a neutral buoyancy case of j wwtp other particles were easily trapped during secondary treatment processes the fibres with low density were easily removed by flotation and grease removal processes on the other hand the fibres with high density generally sank to the bottom of pools due to gravity case of c and ch wwtps which is not a new revelation 56 57 in general there was little difference between the amounts found in primary and secondary sludge in fact the secondary treatment reduced 3 09 of the bulks and 3 47 of the fragments while the fibre concentration surprisingly increased by 6 56 in all treatment systems the fact that the secondary treatment was able to remove more fragments than fibres is consistent 27 comparing the amount of discharged particles mean i 1 n js cs chs ms 421 88 150 53 particles g 1 with the amount of initial flux mean i 1 n jp cp chp 358 10 157 63 particles g 1 table 3 it seems that the particles which were still introduced into the plants with the influent accumulate during the primary treatment stages mainly due to skimming and settling processes 5 27 58 otherwise the suspicious plastic particles count maximum diameter and shape might deform through shear forces on the breakage of larger pieces 11 59 60 more data about microparticles concentration in size detected in the two samplings separately are provided in support information table si 1 our results suggest that the number of particles increases in wwtps with successive absorption of the sludge load i e a concentration of particles was observed throughout the treatment process among the 4 wwtps analysed the highest particulate matter concentration detected belonged to cs secondary sludge the other wwtps had a mean value of 394 115 4 particles g 1 in a similar range as previously reported by chinese and thai studies 27 33 however our study exceeds the data reported by authors from other countries finland italy and australia with lowest reported mean concentrations of 186 7 26 170 9 28 7 112 8 56 89 31 1 14 9 mps g dw respectively 6 29 58 61 table 1 3 2 size distribution across sewage treatment systems the predominant size of particles ranged from 100 to 335 μm and larger particles accounted for less than 15 in all wwtps this possibly indicates a break up of particles during sludge treatment 23 which would no doubt have important implications for fate and mps risk in terrestrial ecosystems 62 leading to nanoplastics release inducing cellular toxicity 63 64 the lack of particles larger than 1000 μm suggests that conventional treatment in cádiz wwtps is efficient in removing large mps a result consistent with studies 37 65 66 the second most common particle size was in the 1000 500 μm range and accounted for 25 on average support information table si 2 studies but the last confirmed that particles larger than 500 μm were almost absent in the secondary treatment 52 61 65 67 considering the breakthrough of sludge from the secondary aeration tanks assuming that the effluent water passes through the same filtration sieve set franco et al 44 found the same dominant size distribution with a 1000 μm mesh sieve stacked atop 500 355 and 100 μm mesh sieves most previous studies have used different sieves ranging from 100 μm to 5000 μm 25 28 68 72 all samples contained fibres bulks and to a lesser extent fragments at the primary treatment secondary treatment showed an increase in fragments with a concomitant absence of bulk possibly due to chemicals such as polyelectrolyte or other flocculants used in secondary treatment that could negatively impact mps removal by causing suspended particles to coalesce into a flocculation 73 at one site js1 particles were absent with fibres and 30 fragments predominating in the largest size class two sites jp2 chp2 lacked fibres with 97 in the 1000 500 μm size class otherwise both wwtps evacuated a total 300 particles g 194 47 of different size classes table si 2 including the previously missing 1000 500 μm class with 28 19 26 13 confirming our doubts larger size classes were most often dominated by fibres and fragments post treatment as in the study by sutton et al 74 unlike primary treatment secondary treatment removed more bulks in all wwtps probably because they have a larger surface area and are more neutrally buoyant particles unlike high density fibres which can escape both the skimming and settling processes 26 37 our results differ from those of some previous studies in which the particles found were divided into three forms fibre bulk or granular and fragment in terms of the removal rate of mps the relative abundance of fragments decreased while that of fibres increased after secondary treatment 37 52 li et al 16 26 zhang and liu 75 found bulk to be the dominant form in greenhouse soils probably due to mulching in contrast few bulks were found throughout the treatment chain 6 the only consistency in this study is that the loading of mps in the digested stabilised sludge after primary and secondary treatments was elevated compared to that in the reclaimed water due to fragments and fibres one possible reason for this is that the fragments and fibres that were easily settled or skimmed off were largely removed during primary treatment while the residuals may have more resistance to be removed further the high fractions removed from wastewater and retained in sludge during sewage treatment were related to the specific microplastic removal efficiency achieved by different secondary treatment technologies with different operating conditions sewage type and population equivalences of each wwtp which require further attention 45 almost all of the particles that came from the primary treatment from the wwtps studied j2 c1 2 and ch2 were embedded in the treatment process at all scales in order jp2 greatly improved the elimination of particles with the largest and smallest sizes except for the 1000 500 μm range c1 2 had a different effect in the two samplings table si 2 cp1 contributed to 23 removal for the 3 size classes but all remained stuck in the 1000 500 μm range cp2 removed 35 from the largest and smallest classes chp2 was not efficient in the middle 1000 355 μm ranges likely due to the fact that sludge had much organic matter which made it difficult to release the middle particles in suspension due to lack of air 18 26 76 j1 and ch1 achieved lower secondary discharges than the primary jp1 acted as chp2 and removed 100 of particles whose size was 5000 μm ch1 is the only wwtp that reduced particles 1000 μm to more than half of the particles in the primary treatment although small particles may have been blocked in the fine grids because what survived the 1000 500 μm range in the coarse grids entered the fine ones 36 comparing the percentage size distribution of m with the mean value of each wwtp fig 4 it is not clear for the discharges of the largest and smallest classes whether the wwtp was able to eliminate or intercept the particles especially since the values obtained by it were the highest compared to the other wwtps as for the medium class m seems to have largely eliminated the particles achieving percentages close to those of the others in summary j was efficient at 5000 1000 and 355 100 μm removing fibres but accumulating fragments c acted about the same and kept the load stable at 500 355 μm removing bulks and fragments but accumulating fibres significantly ch eliminated particles in the 5000 1000 1000 500 μm ranges where it was the only clarifier to be successful and 355 100 μm while loading the 500 355 μm range with 9 fibres 3 3 polymer features analysis by ft ir ft ir analysis was performed for

the particles are classified as synthetic or additives 17 this study confirms their persistence throughout the treatment line as they were present in all samples while tpe was the predominant polymer

note that the frequency of mps in this study 233 6 69 2 mps g dw was similar to those reported in dry weight units elsewhere table 1 24 27 30 however as there is not yet a standard protocol for microplastic analysis a deep comparison with other reports was difficult to further support the previous statement many studies used different anodisc filters and sieve sizes with different criteria in a cross comparison with one study that used the same sieve sizes the main components reported in the effluent 44 were ethylene derivatives which were second only to tpe in the sludge samples implying that the polymer composition in the secondary sludge often mirrors the corresponding regenerated water samples 6 except pp and pe all polymers found in our study have a higher density than regenerated water and should sink 88 in agreement with laboratory studies 87 of the fibres retained in sludge could be dependent on the chance of catching in each sample naturally polymer composition and sludge sample size are interconnected therefore the fibres exhibit the same behaviour as the sludge 78 acting in principle as static pollutant carriers trace elements when pollutants arrive in situ and become trapped over time the mps including fibres with sludge become dynamic microcosms where the microorganisms interact and carry out cometabolism and amensalism leading to the chemicals degradation without energy gain and inhibition of other populations that may colonize the habitat 79 3 4 emission estimates of mps through wwtps no differences were found in the average amounts of mps g in primary and secondary treatments for the 4 wwtps studied and the two samplings carried out 233 6 69 2 mps g p and 230 9 88 0 mps g s again confirming that these particles extracted from the water line leave the wwtps through the sludge without undergoing quantitative changes considering the annual tonnes in the form of dry sludge they report average amounts of 2 34 108 mps t which corresponds to 3 16 1012 mps year according to the national sewage sludge register about 1 200 000 t of sewage sludge in dry matter m s are produced annually in spain taking into account 2 34 108 mps t this would give a quantity of 2 80 1014 mps year in spain with reference to polymer type tpe pet pp pa and ldpe fig 7 were the major polymers detected in all sludge samples with concentrations dry weight ranging from 44 to 235 particles g median of 109 particles g 14 105 particles g median of 45 particles g 0 47 particles g median of 15 particles g 0 39 particles g median of 13 particles g and 1 30 particles g median of 16 particles g respectively the concentrations of each polymer varied depending on the treatment capacity of the wwtps 24 35 the annual environmental emission of mps from sludge disposal in spain was estimated to be 1 4 1014 t year for tpe 45 5 1 1013 t year for pet 16 1 7 1013 t year for pp 7 and 1 3 1013 t year for pa 7 the polymers in intermediate percentage were ldpe 6 1 0 1013 t year and pes 5 9 1 1012 t year other polymers in minor percentage were ps 1 3 hdpe 1 2 tpu 1 2 and ptfe 0 9 and their estimation was 8 1 1012 t year few studies have assessed national estimates only geyer et al 80 and kawecki nowack 89 were in accordance and cited the same polymer types ft ir spectra of the aforementioned polymers are shown in fig 5 the lack of more detailed geospatial information on the wwtps precluded due to the need to preserve the anonymity of the sampling sites further analysis of the estimated emissions of mps from the application of sewage sludge as fertiliser 3 5 method limitations logically these estimates have certain limitations since there is still no standardized method for the study of mps in sewage sludge and therefore it is not possible to make a good comparison with previous studies a low cost but time consuming method of extraction and identification of mps was selected as demonstrated in a previous study 43 however in addition to the fact that there is no generalized protocol for analysing mps microplastic identification remains an arbitrary procedure in which human error could have resulted in false positives this study type serves to give visualization of the large quantities of mps that could be contaminating our agricultural soils in fact a study on mps quantity in nationwide soils will be launched as a future research line the behaviour of mps in terrestrial environmental compartments is a difficult but essential task to understand the fate of plastic in the environment in general only public administrations through the revision of technical regulations for the application of sludge and compost on agricultural soils can establish threshold values for this emerging pollutant in future revisions 4 conclusion this study has reported the presence of mps in conventional sewage sludge from southern spain which can reach agricultural soils for amendment as it is a practice supported by state regulations as for the predominant form of microparticles it was found that fibres trapped by the sedimentation process in primary and secondary treatments were more visible and countable as confirmed by zeiss microscopy and spectral detection than bulks and fragments it is difficult to determine the exact origin of fibrous mps in addition this study aimed to detect particles in the size range below 500 μm as few data were available from previous sludge studies and the predominant particle size was found to be between 100 and 335 μm as in the wastewater study from the same province the predominant polymer type was expected to be tpe due to the diversity and strength of thermoplastic rubber products in contrast the polymer types pcl pa pes ldpe and silicone were found in high concentrations after secondary treatment in this study which can be explained by a large number of fibres and a value of 2 34 108 mps tonne of dry sludge was estimated to be deposited in soils from the 4 wwtps under study this would give an amount of 2 80 1014 mps year in spain this raises the question of the importance of adopting measures to control these pollutants during treatment in conventional wwtps in order to avoid their dispersion into the terrestrial environment credit authorship contribution statement ayda sakali conceptualization investigation methodology formal analysis

12802,low activity of anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria anaob at low temperature is still an obstacle to the application of a single stage partial nitritation anammox spna process in order to improve the performance of nitrogen removal of this system at low ambient temperature the glycine betaine gb was added into a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr at 13 15 c at 15 c the nitrogen removal rate nrr was increased from 0 48 to 0 62 g n l d by adding 1 mm gb with the nitrogen loading rate of 0 81 g n l d the activity of hydrazine oxidase hzo was enhanced from 15 78 to 19 81 μmol cyt c g vss min while the extracellular polymeric substances eps production was reduced from 290 31 to 109 06 mg g vss after exogenous gb when the temperature was 15 c however the promoting effect of 1 mm gb was weakened and the nrr was 0 43 g n l d at 13 c increasing the addition of gb to 1 5 mm did not improve nitrogen removal performance at 13 c whereas it promoted the enrichment of heterotrophic bacteria hb overall results suggested gb had the potential to enhance the metabolic capability of anaob which provided a novel strategy for improving the nitrogen removal performance of spna system at low temperature graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords micro granule partial nitritation anammox metabolic enzyme activities low temperature glycine betaine 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is a way of biological nitrogen removal in which anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria anaob take ammonium as electron donor and nitrite as electron acceptor to remove the ammonia nitrogen in the wastewater without demand of oxygen and organic matters 1 due to its better nitrogen removal rate nrr reduced operational expenses and less working space anammox has been an advantageous biological technology since it was discovered which has been extensively studied as an encouraging method to eliminate nitrogen from wastewaters having high concentration of nitrogen 2 single stage partial nitritation anammox spna process a complete autotrophic nitrogen removal system under oxygen limiting conditions in a single reactor is based on partial nitritation and anammox technologies 3 compared with the flocculent sludge granular sludge is a powerful tool for the spna process since it has high biomass transfer gradient and good sludge settleability 4 in the granular spna system ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob are active in the outer layers of the granule and are responsible for the partial oxidation of ammonium the anaob co exist in the granules in inner layers which are protected from oxygen 5 this synergistic and symbiotic relationship between aob and anaob makes spna system have the advantages of a smaller footprint and lower investment cost 6 temperature is a key parameter for microbial metabolism and growth in most cases the temperature of wastewater is far below the optimum temperature range of function bacteria and varies with the seasons 7 specially low activity of anaob at low temperature constitute the biggest hurdle for specific activities and growth rates of aob and anaob 8 on the one hand anaob have lower growth rates compared with nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob at low temperature 9 on the other hand nob as a competitor could consume the nitrite and oxygen required for anaob and aob resulting increases of effluent nitrate concentration and thus the application of spna at low temperature is still inherent challenge in the practical application therefore how to maintain the biomass of anaob and strengthen their metabolic capacities at low temperature has been one of focuses so far numerous microorganisms accumulate organic solutes termed compatible solutes cs 10 that defined as small and soluble organic molecule which could occur at high intracellular concentration without hindering normal cellular metabolism 11 under some extreme environmental conditions including low temperature cs could protect macromolecules such as membranes against denaturation to strengthen the adaptation of cells 12 glycine betaine gb as a kind of a cost effective cs was widely added into the anaerobic treatment of saline wastewater he et al 13 found that gb concentrations of 0 1 and 0 5 mm contributed to higher cod removal and biogas production rates in the anaerobic bioreactor during treatment of mustard tuber wastewater at low temperatures 8 12 c vyrides et al 14 showed that when using a continuous submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor sambr the addition of 5 mm of gb and operation in batch mode for 2 days could substantially enhance organic degradation as reported by jin et al 15 observed that the addition of gb made the performance of the anammox system increased by around 10 at 11 c the study of zhu et al 16 showed that the addition of gb could slightly improve nitrogen removal performance of anammox system at 20 c however to our knowledge less research has focused on strategies to stabilize the spna process at low temperature by adding gb especially in a continuous flow system moreover considering that gb is organic matter it is necessary to investigate whether the gb addition could cause changes of microbial community structure in spna system in this work the primary objective was to clarify the impacts of gb on the nitrogen removal performance in spna system at lower ambient temperature and higher influent nitrogen load meanwhile the physicochemical properties of the micro granules including metabolic enzyme activities eps content particle sizes distribution were investigated moreover the variations of microbial community were also analyzed these findings could advance the understanding of gb functions in the spna system at low temperature and provide deeper insights into the variation in adapting to decreased temperature all of these will provide suggestions to improve adaptation ability of spna system to decreased temperature for its application in wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the diagram of the spna system was the same as the previous study 17 fig 1 the do concentration was controlled in 0 03 0 20 mg l by keeping aeration rate ar at 2 0 l min in the reactor the synthetic influent was transferred to the reactor by a peristaltic pump before the beginning of this study the spna system has been fed continuously by relatively high ammonia synthetic wastewater containing 280 320 mg n l for approximately 80 days at 25 2 c considering that this study was conducted in winter the temperature in the reactor was not controlled and varied with room temperature the ph value and the do concentration in the reaction unit were measured periodically using a portable do meter and ph meter wtw multi 3430 germany the reactor was fed with synthesize wastewater and continuously operated for 72 days according to the variations of room temperatures and the dosage of gb concentration the whole operational process was divided into six stages table 1 2 2 influent wastewater composition the influent nitrogen substance only contained ammonium by adding nh4cl the composition of mineral medium of synthetic influent was 50 mg l cacl2 2h2o 50 mg l mgso4 2h2o 100 mg l kh2po4 and 1 ml trace element 8 304 g l na2 edta 2h2o 5 000 g l feso4 7h2o 0 215 g l znso4 7h2o 0 120 g l cocl2 6h2o 0 495 g l mncl2 4h2o 0

analysis effluent water samples were collected at the top of the sedimentation unit of the reactor and filtered through qualitative filter paper 0 45 μm aperture sludge samples were collected at the medium of the reaction unit the concentration of nitrogen compounds nh4 n no2 n and no3 n and mlss were determined by standard methods 18 according to the equation for nitrogen balance and

of the gel matrix 21 the method was improved by wang et al to extract eps 17 briefly samples of granule sludge were washed three times with ultrapure water and were suspended in 50 ml buffer solution ph 7 5 20 mm pbs and centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 20 min then 1 mm naoh was dropped into the mixture making the ph value arrive to 13 lastly the supernatant was filtered with 0 45 μm filter membranes to obtain eps the protein and polysaccharides contents of the granules were analyzed the content of polysaccharides was determined by phenol sulfuric acid method the protein was determined by lowry method as the standard using bovine serum albumin 2 5 metabolic enzyme activities the crude hydrazine oxidase hzo was extracted by the method described by shimamura et al 22 and the hzo activity was determined using hydrazine cytochrome c spectrophotometry 23 the hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao from the autotrophic bacteria could catalyze nh2oh to nitrite 24 according to otte et al 25 and yamanaka et al 24 the extraction method of crude enzyme and detection method of enzyme activity were as follows first 25 ml mixture was taken to centrifuge for 3 min at 4000 r min second after pouring the supernatant the precipitate was resuspended with a buffer ph 7 8 50 mm tris hcl 5 mm mgcl2 to 25 ml and repeated this step three times lastly after resuspending to 25 ml the sample was broken at a cell crusher and then centrifuged at 17 500 g for 60 min to remove cell debris and undisrupted cells at 4 c the 0 5 ml enzyme and 4 ml reaction solution ph 8 0 50 mm tris hcl 2 0 mm k3fe cn 6 2 0 mm nh2oh hcl was taken into colorimetric tube which was put into a constant temperature water bath at 25 c for 10 min to terminate the enzyme reaction 2 ml hcl 2 mol l was added immediately into the tube the reaction solution was measured at 400 nm with a uv spectrophotometer tu 1810 in the control experiment 2 ml hcl 2 mol l was added first and then enzyme solution was added each group of experiments were carried out 3 times at the same time and the average value was taken 12 u hao a 400 ε b t v l b mlvss 10 6 where uhao was the absorbance of k3fe cn 6 at 400 nm ε was molar absorptivity 1 l mol cm b was optical path length 1 cm t was reaction time min vl was measuring fluid volume ml and b was dilution multiple 2 6 ex situ specific activities of anaob aob and nob ex situ batch experiments were carried out to test the specific anammox activity saa ammonia oxidation activity saoa and nitrite oxidation activity snoa in brief after being deoxidized by n2 saa tests were performed in 100 ml serum bottles placed in a shaking bath at 180 rpm at 25 c the nutrient medium consisted of nh4cl 150 mg n l and nano2 114 mg n l as the nitrogen source mgcl2 6h2o 50 mg l cacl2 2h2o 50 mg l kh2po4 100 mg l nahco3 1512 mg l and 1 ml trace element saoa and snoa tests were performed in 120 ml erlenmeyer flasks at a temperature of 30 c except for the nitrogen source the composition of the nutrient medium was the same as that used for saa the nitrogen source for the saoa and snoa tests were nh4cl 150 mg n l and nano2 150 mg n l respectively a gas pump was used to supply air into the solution and the gas flow rate was regulated to keep the do concentration being 0 2 mg l samples were taken every 30 min and the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were measured all of the analysis was conducted in two replicates 2 7 statistical analysis three parallel samples were taken each time and eps components and metabolic enzyme activities were determined the mean values of aor and anr were calculated the mean values were taken within 4 days at 4 d 40 d 46 d 56 d 61 d 65 d and 72 d pearson correlation analysis were analyzed by ibm spss statistic 24 2 8 particle size analysis sludge particle size distribution psd was measured in 25 ml of the mixture every 15 days by mastersizer 2000 malvern 2 9 16s rrna gene targeted amplicon sequencing in order to study the variations of microbial community the sludge samples were extracted from the cstr reactor at 28 51 61 and 71 d and detected on an illumina miseq platform at sangon biotech shanghai co ltd in shanghai the pcr amplicons used for high throughput sequencing primers 341f cctacgggnggcwgcag and 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc belong to the v3 v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene all sequences were divided by otus operational taxonomic units at 97 similarity level and statistical analysis was carried out 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance according to the changes of temperature and gb dosage the whole operational period was divided into 6 stages as shown in figs 2 and 3 stage i was served as the adaption of temperature 23 18 c for the spna system because anaob is highly sensitive to environmental conditions 3 and has lower growth rates compared to other bacteria at low temperature 9 the target in this stage was to achieve stable spna in the medium temperature in this period the nh4 neff was slightly increasing indicating that the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite was inhibited with do 0 1 mg l average are was 84 but the no3 neff was reducing and the nor was decreasing making the stoichiometric ratio of δno3 n δnh4 n gradually close to 0 11 0 23 to 0 18 it had been reported that the ratio was close to 0 11 only when the nh4 ninf was bio converted by the spna process 26 so a stable spna system was gradually obtained in this stage after the period of adaption the average nrr and nre reached 0 55 g n l d 68 respectively which was higher than another study 27 at the end of stage i day 41 the nrr decreased to 0 48 g n l d at 15 c stable performance was disrupted since that low temperature may affected the metabolic enzyme activities and mass transfer rates of functional bacteria 28 to investigate whether gb could enhance the nitrogen removal 1 mm gb was added to cstr reactor at day 42 it was found that anr recovered at once and reached a maximum level 0 62 g n l d after continuously adding gb for 4 days but after day 46 the temperature dropped below 15 c which meant a shock to the spna system in series at the end of this period nrr dropped to 0 43 g n l d at 13 c and the strengthening effect of 1 mm gb was not observed on spna system under 15 c hence the gb concentration was increased to 1 5 mm in the stage iii such that nrr recovered to 0 5 g n l d at day 51 as an organic matter gb can be a kind of electron donor which can encourages the growth of heterotrophic bacteria hb including denitrifiers 29 as a result in the next two days the out competition between hb and autotrophic bacteria made the ratio of δno3 n δnh4 n 0 09 0 11 making the nitrogen removal pathway followed a different metabolic pathway 30 to further investigate the effect of gb on nitrogen removal performance at low temperature gb adding was stopped in the stage iv notably during this stage a strong deterioration of nitrogen removal occurred in the system at the same operating conditions at the end of this stage the nrr and nre decreased to 0 17 g n l d and 25 meanwhile the nitrite accumulation made nap rose to 63 previous studies have shown low temperature would lead to nitrite accumulation a sign of fading anammox activity 31 moreover free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna crucial roles in the spna system increased to 3 63 mg l and 3 70 μg l respectively as previously reported for 1 7 2 0 mg l fa could inhibit anaob and in the cell neutralizes the transmembrane potential by inducing changes in the intracellular ph which in extreme cases may cause cell death 32 strous et al 33 put forward that fna in 6 0 μg l would completely inhibit ca brodcadia activity since it acting as a protonophore could inhibit the production of adenosine triphosphate atp by disrupting bacterial transmembrane proton gradients 34 accordingly in the stage v the nh4 ninf concentration was adjusted to 153 9 20 mg l and nlr came to 0 47 g n l d to prevent further adverse effect of fa and fna on the system performance during stage v with the purpose of assessing the restoring effect of gb on system performance 1 mm gb was added to the cstr reactor the operation result showed that the nitrogen removal performance quickly recovered the average nre increased to 65 and the peak value was 75 at day 62 but the no3 neff concentration reached the minimum over the entire experiment while the no2 neff rose to 26 83 mg l at the end of this stage causing the fna increased to 2 52 μg l accordingly the nrr and nre became 0 27 g n l d and 52 separately this vulnerable phenomenon suggested that the denitrifiers could utilize gb as a substrate to metabolize no3 n in stage vi the system performance had some perturbations when gb was removed from the influent with temperature increasing the nitrogen removal performance of the spna system was improved ultimately the average nlr nrr and nre were 0 52 0 27 g n l d and 66 at 15 c it was not obvious that the effect of gb could affect the metabolic activities of aob at low temperature on the stage iii the average do concentration got to 0 17 mg l on the same ar and aor decreased from 0 27 to 0 19 g n l d in other words this system with fa concentration in the range of 0 2 3 7 mg l could attribute to incomplete oxidation of ammonia previous studies found that fa in amount of 0 1 4 0 mg l and 10 150 mg l were found to inhibit nob and aob 29 in this study the range of fa 0 29 3 63 mg n l allowed for selective inhibition of nob making their metabolic ability keep at a lower level 3 2 variations of granular characteristics 3 2 1 change in size of micro granules and sludge concentration in this study granular sludge was formed by self aggregation in the granules the psd curves fig 4a and b presented sharp peaks between 100 and 400 μm indicating the sizes of the majority of granules were maintained in this range the characteristic of granule size distribution could be attributed to the operating condition of airlift induced complete mixing ar 2 0 l min by a glass tube with a diameter of 6 mm a way leading to lager granular erosion and breakage besides sheer force nitrogen sludge loading rate nslr or the food to microorganism ratio obtained by nlr dividing vss concentration could be adopted to further illustrate the stability of microbial aggregation 35 if the nslr applied is inappropriate with the nslr capacity the stabilization of granule size cannot be maintained 36 that is to say the tradeoff between granulation and degranulation could be broken finally breaking the stabilization of the granule size in this study the nslr capacity was the ex situ specific activity of anaob saa table 2 as shown in fig 5 there were differences between the nslr applied and nslr capacity during the whole experiment in stage ii because the saa was enhanced by gb addition the nslr applied was less than nslr capacity for the granule size 1000 μm internal mass transfer limitations and higher mlvss fig 4c could lead to the starvation of microorganism which made the larger particles fragment compared with the reductive trend of larger granules on stage iv granule size below 200 μm became the granule dominant sludge with higher sludge volume percentage and the mean size was decreased from 256 on stage i to 154 μm meanwhile the vss of this stage also showed a declining behavior passing from 5 07 to 4 02 g l which indicated a loss of biomass in the reactor all of phenomena could be attributed to higher applied nslr than nslr capacity at low temperature which made bacteria cells undergo apoptosis for the micro granules between 200 and 400 μm this range size of particles seemed not greatly susceptible to the variation of low temperature meaning that transformation process between particle size 200 μm and 400 μm presented a relatively stable state the effect of oxygen penetration depth i e influence on the percentage of the aerobic fraction of the granules is more significant for small granules 500 μm and consequently affect the activity of aerobic and anoxic bacterial populations 27 therefore the do concentration should be controlled at a proper level in the system at low temperature 3 2 2 variation of eps production as temperature decreasing bacteria would secrete more eps to protect themselves from damage and maintain their activities however the production of eps was a diversion of energy away from cellular growth which might affect the growth of bacteria 37 as displayed in fig 6 the production of eps was reduced from 290 31 to 109 06 mg g vss in the stage ii indicating that the energy allocated for the synthesis of eps was less with the action of gb combining it with better nitrogen removal performance in this stage the functional bacteria might more incline to adapt to low temperature stress by accumulating gb in response to osmotic pressure because this strategy saved more energy for growth and life activities 23 38 however higher eps content may contribute to the granulation of sludge 39 which could be a reason to explain the particle size decreased in this stage in phase iv after a slight rise in stage iii the eps content decreased to 101 15 mg g vss when the gb was not adding based on the enzyme activities it was speculated that the reason for the delayed response was the bacteria were inhibited in the low temperature and higher substrate load the concentration of eps persistently raised to 279 15 mg g vss at the end of stage iv after decreasing the nitrogen load rate the result indicated that with the improvement of environmental conditions the production of eps would return to the original level which was beneficial for bacteria mass transfer and adhesion 3 protein pn and ps were the main components of eps and the concentration of pn was generally higher than that of ps in the study though the trend of eps and pn was similar the ps content compared to the phase i was increased by 30 47 21 and 47 in phases iii iv v and vi respectively thus ps may contribute more to relieving low temperature stress 40 3 2 3 variation of metabolic enzyme activities enzyme activities are indicatives of the working states of the reaction systems the hzo is an enzyme of anaob the key in the conversion of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas which is only found in anammoxsome inside anaob 41 fig 7 displayed the variation of hzo activity during this study there was a shock of low temperature on day 40 correspondingly the expression of cold shock proteins which could repress the synthesis of most protein for mesophilic bacteria was sharply induced to high levels 42 resulting down regulation of metabolic activity of anaob also operating at lower temperatures could cause a rise in ladderane fatty acids concentrations which in turn reduces membrane permeability and also passives diffusion of protons out of the anammoxosome 43 these variations allow ions to enter the cell in uncontrolled fashion preventing atp synthesis and thereby reducing metabolism which might explain the reason that hzo activity decreased from 19 88 to 15 78 μmol cyt c g vss min at the end of stage i significantly the hzo activity in the stage ii enhanced to 19 81 μmol cyt c g vss min which could be attributed to the role of gb 1 mm in maintaining membrane liquidity at low temperature stabilizing protein at high ionic strength inside the cell and the ability to prevent cold induced aggregation of cellular proteins 16 44 45 however when the gb content increased to 1 5 mm the hzo activity fell significantly to 12 26 μmol cyt c g vss min compared with the previous studies showed in table 3 1 5 mm gb in this study was a higher concentration in the continuous term gb addition adapted reactor accumulation of gb in cell could affect the ecological relationship between denitrifying bacteria db and anaob making the overwhelming species in spna system abdicate this result was in line with the findings of other researcher 15 the downward trend the hzo activity still showed in the stage iv this might be due to the abundance of anaob were not enough to tolerate the high nh4 ninf at low temperature in this stage in phase v with the nlr lowering and 1 mm gb adding the hzo activity was improved at the end of this study this kind of enzyme activity was 11 08 μmol cyt c g vss min meaning that anaob remained active additionally pearson correlation analysis showed that anr was significantly correlated with hzo activity r 0 961 p 0 01 thus the fluctuation in performance of the anammox process under different condition could be partly attributed to the variation of hzo activity nitritation has been reported to be the rate limiting step for pna applications at high temperature 47 the effect of low temperature and gb affecting the physiological activities of aob was investigated by monitoring the hao activity fig 4f compared with that at day 4 the hao activity decreased by 29 29 38 00 and 48 76 respectively at days 46 61 and 72 consequently during the whole study period the hao activity was trending downward which displayed that 1 1 5 mm gb seemed to have a little function for improving hao activity previous finding illustrated that the optimum concentration of gb for aob was higher than that for anaob due to the difference between these two types of bacteria in cellular structure 46 the pearson correlation analysis also displayed that aor was correlated with hao activity r 0 884 p 0 01 3 3 changes of microbial community in the spna sludge there are complex ecological niches including bacteria cooperated to fulfill the nitrogen removal process the dynamic succession of microorganisms in different stages was analyzed by 16s rrna gene targeted amplicon sequencing to determine the mutual relationship of the critical bacterial community the main phyla were proteobacteria planctomycetes bacteroidetes chloroflexi and nitrospirae fig 8a it was worth noting that the planctomycetes showed an increase in stage ii the trend of planctomycetes abundance was similar to that of hzo activity the reason for this phenomenon was that the value of hzo activity was mainly determined by anaob which was phylogenetically clustered with monophyletic groups within brocadiales in the phylum planctomycetes 48 notably the chloroflexi which provides carbon source for db by degrading organics 49 and the bacteroides which have strong metabolic ability to organics maintained relatively higher relative abundances results indicated that both bacteria might consume gb and utilize endogenous organic matters in the metabolic system eventually converting them into energy for db growth and metabolism therefore after stage ii the proteobacteria including many nitrogen fixing bacteria increased 50 making a more complex nitrogen removal pathway in spna system change uncultured cadidatus brocadiaceae were determined to be the main anaob at the genus level fig 8b especially on stage ii with a relative abundance of 18 51 a review article reported the half saturation constant ks for nh4 n of cadidatus kuenenia is much smaller than that of cadidatus brocadia indicating cadidatus brocadia is better adapted to environment with nh4 n rich 51 meanwhile under the condition of oxygen limitation at low temperature if there are organics in the system cadidatus brocadia has a competitive advantage over others 52 accordingly under the action of gb uncultured cadidatus brocadiaceae could maintain higher relative abundance 2 79 even if the temperature was below 15 c on the stage vi the cooperation of microbial community in the spna process is always the major challenge which is related to the competitions between anaob and nob for nitrite and between aob and nob for oxygen 53 the relative abundance of aob dominated by nitrosomaonas was still 5 during the whole experiment indicating no2 n produced by aob oxidizing nh4 n was continuously and stably supplied for anaob notably nob dominated by nitrospira known for successful adaption in hypoxic environmental 54 was also detected on stage ii since the oxygen limiting conditions imposed and the higher relative abundance of anaob there were less oxygen and nitrite available for the growth of nob making the relative abundance of nitrospira reduce however after stage ii with the decrease of particle size and aob activity the anoxic zones of granules were decreasing which meant the oxygen penetrated too deep into the granule to maintain an adequate biomass of anaob for anammox meanwhile when the nob adapted the fa inhibition higher residual nitrite concentrations could hamper nob repression resulting the relative abundance of nitrospira with the lowest half saturation constant 22 increased from 2 10 to 5 60 on stage iv finally to 7 06 on stage vi despite their higher relative abundance in the spna system the performance of nitrogen removal influenced by nob was not obvious significantly after adding gb terrimonas acinetobacter hyphomicrobium thermomonas and so on were growing which likely was responsible for alleviating nitrate accumulation and promoting the production of nitrite meanwhile uncultured anaerolineaceae utilizing glucose and n acetyl glucosamine a main component of cell wall peptidoglycan of most bacteria 55 and ignavibacterium catabolizing extracellular peptides while recycling nitrate to nitrite 56 were the main genera in hb and maintained higher relative abundance after stage ii the growth of hb showed that bacterial apoptosis occurred in the system and thus continuously adding gb and low temperature might promote the growth of db and other hb which facilitates the development of heterotrophic denitrification process in the system 4 conclusions adding 1 mm gb to the spna system at 15 c could immediately improve the nitrogen removal performance by enhancing hzo activity and reducing eps content when the temperature was below 15 c the adverse effects could not be eliminated by increasing the addition amount of gb microbial community analysis indicated that continuously adding gb caused the proliferation of hb the decrease of the relative abundance of anaob and the increase of the relative abundance of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob could lead to the deteriorative performance of nitrogen removal at 13 c funding sources this work was supported by

12802,low activity of anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria anaob at low temperature is still an obstacle to the application of a single stage partial nitritation anammox spna process in order to improve the performance of nitrogen removal of this system at low ambient temperature the glycine betaine gb was added into a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr at 13 15 c at 15 c the nitrogen removal rate nrr was increased from 0 48 to 0 62 g n l d by adding 1 mm gb with the nitrogen loading rate of 0 81 g n l d the activity of hydrazine oxidase hzo was enhanced from 15 78 to 19 81 μmol cyt c g vss min while the extracellular polymeric substances eps production was reduced from 290 31 to 109 06 mg g vss after exogenous gb when the temperature was 15 c however the promoting effect of 1 mm gb was weakened and the nrr was 0 43 g n l d at 13 c increasing the addition of gb to 1 5 mm did not improve nitrogen removal performance at 13 c whereas it promoted the enrichment of heterotrophic bacteria hb overall results suggested gb had the potential to enhance the metabolic capability of anaob which provided a novel strategy for improving the nitrogen removal performance of spna system at low temperature graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords micro granule partial nitritation anammox metabolic enzyme activities low temperature glycine betaine 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is a way of biological nitrogen removal in which anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria anaob take ammonium as electron donor and nitrite as electron acceptor to remove the ammonia nitrogen in the wastewater without demand of oxygen and organic matters 1 due to its better nitrogen removal rate nrr reduced operational expenses and less working space anammox has been an advantageous biological technology since it was discovered which has been extensively studied as an encouraging method to eliminate nitrogen from wastewaters having high concentration of nitrogen 2 single stage partial nitritation anammox spna process a complete autotrophic nitrogen removal system under oxygen limiting conditions in a single reactor is based on partial nitritation and anammox technologies 3 compared with the flocculent sludge granular sludge is a powerful tool for the spna process since it has high biomass transfer gradient and good sludge settleability 4 in the granular spna system ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob are active in the outer layers of the granule and are responsible for the partial oxidation of ammonium the anaob co exist in the granules in inner layers which are protected from oxygen 5 this synergistic and symbiotic relationship between aob and anaob makes spna system have the advantages of a smaller footprint and lower investment cost 6 temperature is a key parameter for microbial metabolism and growth in most cases the temperature of wastewater is far below the optimum temperature range of function bacteria and varies with the seasons 7 specially low activity of anaob at low temperature constitute the biggest hurdle for specific activities and growth rates of aob and anaob 8 on the one hand anaob have lower growth rates compared with nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob at low temperature 9 on the other hand nob as a competitor could consume the nitrite and oxygen required for anaob and aob resulting increases of effluent nitrate concentration and thus the application of spna at low temperature is still inherent challenge in the practical application therefore how to maintain the biomass of anaob and strengthen their metabolic capacities at low temperature has been one of focuses so far numerous microorganisms accumulate organic solutes termed compatible solutes cs 10 that defined as small and soluble organic molecule which could occur at high intracellular concentration without hindering normal cellular metabolism 11 under some extreme environmental conditions including low temperature cs could protect macromolecules such as membranes against denaturation to strengthen the adaptation of cells 12 glycine betaine gb as a kind of a cost effective cs was widely added into the anaerobic treatment of saline wastewater he et al 13 found that gb concentrations of 0 1 and 0 5 mm contributed to higher cod removal and biogas production rates in the anaerobic bioreactor during treatment of mustard tuber wastewater at low temperatures 8 12 c vyrides et al 14 showed that when using a continuous submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor sambr the addition of 5 mm of gb and operation in batch mode for 2 days could substantially enhance organic degradation as reported by jin et al 15 observed that the addition of gb made the performance of the anammox system increased by around 10 at 11 c the study of zhu et al 16 showed that the addition of gb could slightly improve nitrogen removal performance of anammox system at 20 c however to our knowledge less research has focused on strategies to stabilize the spna process at low temperature by adding gb especially in a continuous flow system moreover considering that gb is organic matter it is necessary to investigate whether the gb addition could cause changes of microbial community structure in spna system in this work the primary objective was to clarify the impacts of gb on the nitrogen removal performance in spna system at lower ambient temperature and higher influent nitrogen load meanwhile the physicochemical properties of the micro granules including metabolic enzyme activities eps content particle sizes distribution were investigated moreover the variations of microbial community were also analyzed these findings could advance the understanding of gb functions in the spna system at low temperature and provide deeper insights into the variation in adapting to decreased temperature all of these will provide suggestions to improve adaptation ability of spna system to decreased temperature for its application in wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the diagram of the spna system was the same as the previous study 17 fig 1 the do concentration was controlled in 0 03 0 20 mg l by keeping aeration rate ar at 2 0 l min in the reactor the synthetic influent was transferred to the reactor by a peristaltic pump before the beginning of this study the spna system has been fed continuously by relatively high ammonia synthetic wastewater containing 280 320 mg n l for approximately 80 days at 25 2 c considering that this study was conducted in winter the temperature in the reactor was not controlled and varied with room temperature the ph value and the do concentration in the reaction unit were measured periodically using a portable do meter and ph meter wtw multi 3430 germany the reactor was fed with synthesize wastewater and continuously operated for 72 days according to the variations of room temperatures and the dosage of gb concentration the whole operational process was divided into six stages table 1 2 2 influent wastewater composition the influent nitrogen substance only contained ammonium by adding nh4cl the composition of mineral medium of synthetic

analysis effluent water samples were collected at the top of the sedimentation unit of the reactor and filtered through qualitative filter paper 0 45 μm aperture sludge samples were collected at the medium of the reaction unit the concentration of nitrogen compounds nh4 n no2 n and no3 n and mlss were determined by standard methods 18 according to the equation for nitrogen balance and

n l ph and t were the value of ph and temperature c in the spna system 2 4 extracellular polymer analysis naoh method could significantly improve the solubilities of eps without damaging the structure of the gel matrix 21 the method was improved by wang et al to extract eps 17 briefly samples of granule sludge were washed three times with ultrapure water and were suspended in 50 ml buffer solution ph 7 5 20 mm pbs and centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 20 min then 1 mm naoh was dropped into the mixture making the ph value arrive to 13 lastly the supernatant was filtered with 0 45 μm filter membranes to obtain eps the protein and polysaccharides contents of the granules were analyzed the content of polysaccharides was determined by phenol sulfuric acid method the protein was determined by lowry method as the standard using bovine serum albumin 2 5 metabolic enzyme activities the crude hydrazine oxidase hzo was extracted by the method described by shimamura et al 22 and the hzo activity was determined using hydrazine cytochrome c spectrophotometry 23 the hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao from the autotrophic bacteria could catalyze nh2oh to nitrite 24 according to otte et al 25 and yamanaka et al 24 the extraction method of crude enzyme and detection method of enzyme activity were as follows first 25 ml mixture was taken to centrifuge for 3 min at 4000 r min second after pouring the supernatant the precipitate was resuspended with a buffer ph 7 8 50 mm tris hcl 5 mm mgcl2 to 25 ml and repeated this step three times lastly after resuspending to 25 ml the sample was broken at a cell crusher and then centrifuged at 17 500 g for 60 min to remove cell debris and undisrupted cells at 4 c the 0 5 ml enzyme and 4 ml reaction solution ph 8 0 50 mm tris hcl 2 0 mm k3fe cn 6 2 0 mm nh2oh hcl was taken into colorimetric tube which was put into a constant temperature water bath at 25 c for 10 min to terminate the enzyme reaction 2 ml hcl 2 mol l was added immediately into the tube the reaction solution was measured at 400 nm with a uv spectrophotometer tu 1810 in the control experiment 2 ml hcl 2 mol l was added first and then enzyme solution was added each group of experiments were carried out 3 times at the same time and the average value was taken 12 u hao a 400 ε b t v l b mlvss 10 6 where uhao was the absorbance of k3fe cn 6 at 400 nm ε was molar absorptivity 1 l mol cm b was optical path length 1 cm t was reaction time min vl was measuring fluid volume ml and b was dilution multiple 2 6 ex situ specific activities of anaob aob and nob ex situ batch experiments were carried out to test the specific anammox activity saa ammonia oxidation activity saoa and nitrite oxidation activity snoa in brief after being deoxidized by n2 saa tests were performed in 100 ml serum bottles placed in a shaking bath at 180 rpm at 25 c the nutrient medium consisted of nh4cl 150 mg n l and nano2 114 mg n l as the nitrogen source mgcl2 6h2o 50 mg l cacl2 2h2o 50 mg l kh2po4 100 mg l nahco3 1512 mg l and 1 ml trace element saoa and snoa tests were performed in 120 ml erlenmeyer flasks at a temperature of 30 c except for the nitrogen source the composition of the nutrient medium was the same as that used for saa the nitrogen source for the saoa and snoa tests were nh4cl 150 mg n l and nano2 150 mg n l respectively a gas pump was used to supply air into the solution and the gas flow rate was regulated to keep the do concentration being 0 2 mg l samples were taken every 30 min and the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were measured all of the analysis was conducted in two replicates 2 7 statistical analysis three parallel samples were taken each time and eps components and metabolic enzyme activities were determined the mean values of aor and anr were calculated the mean values were taken within 4 days at 4 d 40 d 46 d 56 d 61 d 65 d and 72 d pearson correlation analysis were analyzed by ibm spss statistic 24 2 8 particle size analysis sludge particle size distribution psd was measured in 25 ml of the mixture every 15 days by mastersizer 2000 malvern 2 9 16s rrna gene targeted amplicon sequencing in order to study the variations of microbial community the sludge samples were extracted from the cstr reactor at 28 51 61 and 71 d and detected on an illumina miseq platform at sangon biotech shanghai co ltd in shanghai the pcr amplicons used for high throughput sequencing primers 341f cctacgggnggcwgcag and 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc belong to the v3 v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene all sequences were divided by otus operational taxonomic units at 97 similarity level and statistical analysis was carried out 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance according to the changes of temperature and gb dosage the whole operational period was divided into 6 stages as shown in figs 2 and 3 stage i was served as the adaption of temperature 23 18 c for the spna system because anaob is highly sensitive to environmental conditions 3 and has lower growth rates compared to other bacteria at low temperature 9 the target in this stage was to achieve stable spna in the medium temperature in this period the nh4 neff was slightly increasing indicating that the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite was inhibited with do 0 1 mg l average are was 84 but the no3 neff was reducing and the nor was decreasing making the stoichiometric ratio of δno3 n δnh4 n gradually close to 0 11 0 23 to 0 18 it had been reported that the ratio was close to 0 11 only when the nh4 ninf was bio converted by the spna process 26 so a stable spna system was gradually obtained in this stage after the period of adaption the average nrr and nre reached 0 55 g n l d 68 respectively which was higher than another study 27 at the end of stage i day 41 the nrr decreased to 0 48 g n l d at 15 c stable performance was disrupted since that low temperature may affected the metabolic enzyme activities and mass transfer rates of functional bacteria 28 to investigate whether gb could enhance the nitrogen removal 1 mm gb was added to cstr reactor at day 42 it was found that anr recovered at once and reached a maximum level 0 62 g n l d after continuously adding gb for 4 days but after day 46 the temperature dropped below 15 c which meant a shock to the spna system in series at the end of this period nrr dropped to 0 43 g n l d at 13 c and the strengthening effect of 1 mm gb was not observed on spna system under 15 c hence the gb concentration was increased to 1 5 mm in the stage iii such that nrr recovered to 0 5 g n l d at day 51 as an organic matter gb can be a kind of electron donor which can encourages the growth of heterotrophic bacteria hb including denitrifiers 29 as a result in the next two days the out competition between hb and autotrophic bacteria made the ratio of δno3 n δnh4 n 0 09 0 11 making the nitrogen removal pathway followed a different metabolic pathway 30 to further investigate the effect of gb on nitrogen removal performance at low temperature gb adding was stopped in the stage iv notably during this stage a strong deterioration of nitrogen removal occurred in the system at the same operating conditions at the end of this stage the nrr and nre decreased to 0 17 g n l d and 25 meanwhile the nitrite accumulation made nap rose to 63 previous studies have shown low temperature would lead to nitrite accumulation a sign of fading anammox activity 31 moreover free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna crucial roles in the spna system increased to 3 63 mg l and 3 70 μg l respectively as previously reported for 1 7 2 0 mg l fa could inhibit anaob and in the cell neutralizes the transmembrane potential by inducing changes in the intracellular ph which in extreme cases may cause cell death 32 strous et al 33 put forward that fna in 6 0 μg l would completely inhibit ca brodcadia activity since it acting as a protonophore could inhibit the production of adenosine triphosphate atp by disrupting bacterial transmembrane proton gradients 34 accordingly in the stage v the nh4 ninf concentration was adjusted to 153 9 20 mg l and nlr came to 0 47 g n l d to prevent further adverse effect of fa and fna on the system performance during stage v with the purpose of assessing the restoring effect of gb on system performance 1 mm gb was added to the cstr reactor the operation result showed that the nitrogen removal performance quickly recovered the average nre increased to 65 and the peak value was 75 at day 62 but the no3 neff concentration reached the minimum over the entire experiment while the no2 neff rose to 26 83 mg l at the end of this stage causing the fna increased to 2 52 μg l accordingly the nrr and nre became 0 27 g n l d and 52 separately this vulnerable phenomenon suggested that the denitrifiers could utilize gb as a substrate to metabolize no3 n in stage vi the system performance had some perturbations when gb was removed from the influent with temperature increasing the nitrogen removal performance of the spna system was improved ultimately the average nlr nrr and nre were 0 52 0 27 g n l d and 66 at 15 c it was not obvious that the effect of gb could affect the metabolic activities of aob at low temperature on the stage iii the average do concentration got to 0 17 mg l on the same ar and aor decreased from 0 27 to 0 19 g n l d in other words this system with fa concentration in the range of 0 2 3 7 mg l could attribute to incomplete oxidation of ammonia previous studies found that fa in amount of 0 1 4 0 mg l and 10 150 mg l were found to inhibit nob and aob 29 in this study the range of fa 0 29 3 63 mg n l allowed for selective inhibition of nob making their metabolic ability keep at a lower level 3 2 variations of granular characteristics 3 2 1 change in size of micro granules and sludge concentration in this study granular sludge was formed by self aggregation in the granules the psd curves fig 4a and b presented sharp peaks between 100 and 400 μm indicating the sizes of the majority of granules were maintained in this range the characteristic of granule size distribution could be attributed to the operating condition of airlift induced complete mixing ar 2 0 l min by a glass tube with a diameter of 6 mm a way leading to lager granular erosion and breakage besides sheer force nitrogen sludge loading rate nslr or the food to microorganism ratio obtained by nlr dividing vss concentration could be adopted to further illustrate the stability of microbial aggregation 35 if the nslr applied is inappropriate with the nslr capacity the stabilization of granule size cannot be maintained 36 that is to say the tradeoff between granulation and degranulation could be broken finally breaking the stabilization of the granule size in this study the nslr capacity was the ex situ specific activity of anaob saa table 2 as shown in fig 5 there were differences between the nslr applied and nslr capacity during the whole experiment in stage ii because the saa was enhanced by gb addition the nslr applied was less than nslr capacity for the granule size 1000 μm internal mass transfer limitations and higher mlvss fig 4c could lead to the starvation of microorganism which made the larger particles fragment compared with the reductive trend of larger granules on stage iv granule size below 200 μm became the granule dominant sludge with higher sludge volume percentage and the mean size was decreased from 256 on stage i to 154 μm meanwhile the vss of this stage also showed a declining behavior passing from 5 07 to 4 02 g l which indicated a loss of biomass in the reactor all of phenomena could be attributed to higher applied nslr than nslr capacity at low temperature which made bacteria cells undergo apoptosis for the micro granules between 200 and 400 μm this range size of particles seemed not greatly susceptible to the variation of low temperature meaning that transformation process between particle size 200 μm and 400 μm presented a relatively stable state the effect of oxygen penetration depth i e influence on the percentage of the aerobic fraction of the granules is more significant for small granules 500 μm and consequently affect the activity of aerobic and anoxic bacterial populations 27 therefore the do concentration should be controlled at a proper level in the system at low temperature 3 2 2 variation of eps production as temperature decreasing bacteria would secrete more eps to protect themselves from damage and maintain their activities however the production of eps was a diversion of energy away from cellular growth which might affect the growth of bacteria 37 as displayed in fig 6 the production of eps was reduced from 290 31 to 109 06 mg g vss in the stage ii indicating that the energy allocated for the synthesis of eps was less with the action of gb combining it with better nitrogen removal performance in this stage the functional bacteria might more incline to adapt to low temperature stress by accumulating gb in response to osmotic pressure because this strategy saved more energy for growth and life activities 23 38 however higher eps content may contribute to the granulation of sludge 39 which could be a reason to explain the particle size decreased in this stage in phase iv after a slight rise in stage iii the eps content decreased to 101 15 mg g vss when the gb was not adding based on the enzyme activities it was speculated that the reason for the delayed response was the bacteria were inhibited in the low temperature and higher substrate load the concentration of eps persistently raised to 279 15 mg g vss at the end of stage iv after decreasing the nitrogen load rate the result indicated that with the improvement of environmental conditions the production of eps would return to the original level which was beneficial for bacteria mass transfer and adhesion 3 protein pn and ps were the main components of eps and the concentration of pn was generally higher than that of ps in the study though the trend of eps and pn was similar the ps content compared to the phase i was increased by 30 47 21 and 47 in phases iii iv v and vi respectively thus ps may contribute more to relieving low temperature stress 40 3 2 3 variation of metabolic enzyme activities enzyme activities are indicatives of the working states of the reaction systems the hzo is an enzyme of anaob the key in the conversion of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas which is only found in anammoxsome inside anaob 41 fig 7 displayed the variation of hzo activity during this study there was a shock of low temperature on day 40 correspondingly the expression of cold shock proteins which could repress the synthesis of most protein for mesophilic bacteria was sharply induced to high levels 42 resulting down regulation of metabolic activity of anaob also operating at lower temperatures could cause a rise in ladderane fatty acids concentrations which in turn reduces membrane permeability and also passives diffusion of protons out of the anammoxosome 43 these variations allow ions to enter the cell in uncontrolled fashion preventing atp synthesis and thereby reducing metabolism which might explain the reason that hzo activity decreased from 19 88 to 15 78 μmol cyt c g vss min at the end of stage i significantly the hzo activity in the stage ii enhanced to 19 81 μmol cyt c g vss min which could be attributed to the role of gb 1 mm in maintaining membrane liquidity at low temperature stabilizing protein at high ionic strength inside the cell and the ability to prevent cold induced aggregation of cellular proteins 16 44 45 however when the gb content increased to 1 5 mm the hzo activity fell significantly to 12 26 μmol cyt c g vss min compared with the previous studies showed in table 3 1 5 mm gb in this study was a higher concentration in the continuous term gb addition adapted reactor accumulation of gb in cell could affect the ecological relationship between denitrifying bacteria db and anaob making the overwhelming species in spna system abdicate this result was in line with the findings of other researcher 15 the downward trend the hzo activity still showed in the stage iv this might be due to the abundance of anaob were not enough to tolerate the high nh4 ninf at low temperature in this stage in phase v with the nlr lowering and 1 mm gb adding the hzo activity was improved at the end of this study this kind of enzyme activity was 11 08 μmol cyt c g vss min meaning that anaob remained active additionally pearson correlation analysis showed that anr was significantly correlated with hzo activity r 0 961 p 0 01 thus the fluctuation in performance of the anammox process under different condition could be partly attributed to the variation of hzo activity nitritation has been reported to be the rate limiting step for pna applications at high temperature 47 the effect of low temperature and gb affecting the physiological activities of aob was investigated by monitoring the hao activity fig 4f compared with that at day 4 the hao activity decreased by 29 29 38 00 and 48 76 respectively at days 46 61 and 72 consequently during the whole study period the hao activity was trending downward which displayed that 1 1 5 mm gb seemed to have a little function for improving hao activity previous finding illustrated that the optimum concentration of gb for aob was higher than that for anaob due to the difference between these two types of bacteria in cellular structure 46 the pearson correlation analysis also displayed that aor was correlated with hao activity r 0 884 p 0 01 3 3 changes of microbial community in the spna sludge there are complex ecological niches including bacteria cooperated to fulfill the nitrogen removal process the dynamic succession of microorganisms in different stages was analyzed by 16s rrna gene targeted amplicon sequencing to determine the mutual relationship of the critical bacterial community the main phyla were proteobacteria planctomycetes bacteroidetes chloroflexi and nitrospirae fig 8a it was worth noting that the planctomycetes showed an increase in stage ii the trend of planctomycetes abundance was similar to that of hzo activity the reason for this phenomenon was that the value of hzo activity was mainly determined by anaob which was phylogenetically clustered with monophyletic groups within brocadiales in the phylum planctomycetes 48 notably the chloroflexi which provides carbon source for db by degrading organics 49 and the bacteroides which have strong metabolic ability to organics maintained relatively higher relative abundances results indicated that both bacteria might consume gb and utilize endogenous organic matters in the metabolic system eventually converting them into energy for db growth and metabolism therefore after stage ii the proteobacteria including many nitrogen fixing bacteria increased 50 making a more complex nitrogen removal pathway in spna system change uncultured cadidatus brocadiaceae were determined to be the main anaob at the genus level fig 8b especially on stage ii with a relative abundance of 18 51 a review article reported the half saturation constant ks for nh4 n of cadidatus kuenenia is much smaller than that of cadidatus brocadia indicating cadidatus brocadia is better adapted to environment with nh4 n rich 51 meanwhile under the condition of oxygen limitation at low temperature if there are organics in the system cadidatus brocadia has a competitive advantage over others 52 accordingly under the action of gb uncultured cadidatus brocadiaceae could maintain higher relative abundance 2 79 even if the temperature was below 15 c on the stage vi the cooperation of microbial community in the spna process is always the major challenge which is related to the competitions between anaob and nob for nitrite and between aob and nob for oxygen 53 the relative abundance of aob dominated by nitrosomaonas was still 5 during the whole experiment indicating no2 n produced by aob oxidizing nh4 n was continuously and stably supplied for anaob notably nob dominated by nitrospira known for successful adaption in hypoxic environmental 54 was also detected on stage ii since the oxygen limiting conditions imposed and the higher relative abundance of anaob there were less oxygen and nitrite available for the growth of nob making the relative abundance of nitrospira reduce however after stage ii with the decrease of particle size and aob activity the anoxic zones of granules were decreasing which meant the oxygen penetrated too deep into the granule to maintain an adequate biomass of anaob for anammox meanwhile when the nob adapted the fa inhibition higher residual nitrite concentrations could hamper nob repression resulting the relative abundance of nitrospira with the lowest half saturation constant 22 increased from 2 10 to 5 60 on stage iv finally to 7 06 on stage vi despite their higher relative abundance in the spna system the performance of nitrogen removal influenced by nob was not obvious significantly after adding gb terrimonas acinetobacter hyphomicrobium thermomonas and so on were growing which likely was responsible for alleviating nitrate accumulation and promoting the production of nitrite meanwhile uncultured anaerolineaceae utilizing glucose and n acetyl glucosamine a main component of cell wall peptidoglycan of most bacteria 55 and ignavibacterium catabolizing extracellular peptides while recycling nitrate to nitrite 56 were the main genera in hb and maintained higher relative abundance after stage ii the growth of hb showed that bacterial apoptosis occurred in the system and thus continuously adding gb and low temperature might promote the growth of db and other hb which facilitates the development of heterotrophic denitrification process in the system 4 conclusions adding 1 mm gb to the spna system at 15 c could immediately improve the nitrogen removal performance by enhancing hzo activity and reducing eps content when the temperature was below 15 c the adverse effects could not be eliminated by increasing the addition amount of gb microbial community analysis indicated that continuously adding gb caused the proliferation of hb the decrease of the relative abundance of anaob and the increase of the relative abundance of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob could lead to the deteriorative performance of nitrogen removal at 13 c funding sources this work was supported by

technology advancement renewable energy sources may decrease the extra energy needed by a membrane with tiny holes recent years have seen a significant increase in interest in three dimensional printing 3d printing 3d p surface imprinting technologies in general have not yet reached the maturity stage of development notably in membrane design and production it is discussed in this review article how different 3d printing technologies are now accessible how they relate to current breakthroughs in the area and how they may be used to fabricate nanosheets module spacers or thin layers design for water purification as well as potential applications of surface imprinting in the near future it is anticipated that the revolutionary synthesis of novel membrane module components will occur in the near future due to recent breakthroughs in 3d p technology it is predicted that 3d p technologies would create a broader range of membrane module components with improved efficacy and

purification photodegradation 1 introduction 3d printing 3d p is not as fast as traditional manufacturing when it comes to producing materials for water desalination and purification it benefits rapid prototyping rp which is helpful in several ways 1 2 a technique for producing objects by layering them together 3d p also known as additive manufacturing am was developed in 1981 and it has since acquired broad popularity 3 since then there has been substantial growth in interest in industrial things due to the complexity and variety of ways they might work following recent technological developments it is now feasible to study the relevance of 3d p in the fabrication of new materials such as nanomaterials biological materials smart materials and membranes 3d p in addition has uses in a variety of industries including construction aerospace medicinal research and the food business to mention a few 3 4 three dimensional printing is becoming more popular in water related procedures such as wastewater treatment desalination or water purification according to recent studies 3d printing has inspired interest in manufacturing membrane modules including spiral wrapped modules swm among other applications 2 5 3d p offers production flexibility it can quickly and inexpensively fabricate complex manufacturing 5 6 however several fabricating constraints must be addressed before the 3d p of membrane module components can be improved which is why this is challenging 7 as a whole 3d p solved several challenges that have developed in the water purification domain including pressure drop concentration polarization fouling issues and inefficient mass transport among other things 8 currently research has focused on surface nanostructured imprinted materials and possibilities in water technology including solvent extraction and purification and other domains have been established 8 surface imprint embedded 3d printing has the potential to significantly enhance the manufacturing of membranes and other water filtration technologies with complicated morphology since imprinting strategies appear more efficient than 3d p approaches in the formulation of polymer based technologies they are more successful at fabricating materials utilized in biofouling or microbial based water purification processes 1 9 although there are various benefits to the procedures used to synthesize molecularly imprinted polymers mips a few disadvantages include restricted mass transfer and a limit on the number of mips created aside from addressing the drawbacks associated with conventional large scale imprinting of mips procedures on polymer or substrate 5 9 global warming has become a greater danger for civilization thus the need for drinkable water has grown substantially 10 11 hence water cleaning and desalination become crucial to recycling and reusability 12 membrane nanotechnology has also acquired crucial relevance in this respect since its incredible capacity and efficiency make them an appealing choice for tackling the problem of water scarcity to meet the growing demand for high efficiency membrane surfaces 3d p was prompted to produce them quickly and precisely to fabricate them quickly and accurately 13 researchers took advantage of this by using the technology for the water energy nexus it is also critical to have precise manufacture of water treatment membrane 3d p would also make it feasible to create strong and thin membranes with consistent pore diameters 14 layer by layering nanofabrication patterning of membrane surface may be used to obtain a well organized pore size and a robust structure in addition to accurate or speedy fabrication 3d p for membrane manufacturing is significant since it allows for more economical and less wasteful production 15 thermally induced phase separation non solvent induced phase separation and vapor induced separation have emerged as widely used membrane production techniques 15 since these procedures need substantial solvent volume they generate enormous amounts of hazardous waste and contribute to environmental damage 15 it is well known that monomers used in membrane production are poisonous that may have severe consequences on human health 16 furthermore mixing these poisonous compounds with water during the membrane production development results in 50 billion liters of wastewater annually which is significant 17 considering the emissions created to clean 50 billion liters of wastewater shipping the manufactured product and the isolation packs becomes an even more noticeable cause of concern 17 18 on top of that the production associated with these traditional technologies leads to a substantial amount of waste being generated 17 19 when 3d p technology became commercially available it completely changed the manufacturing industry because it could make precise and consistent things while being environmentally friendly 18 this technology has been used in water treatment membrane research and other fields of science reducing the number of solvents that are wasted and as a result reducing the amount of carbon dioxide released during making the membranes 20 at the moment a lot of attention is paid to the fabrication of membrane modules 21 nanomaterials have been printed on the membrane surface for high selectivity and low fouling resistance 21 this has helped membrane surface research use inkjet printing to improve surface attributes such as selectivity and fouling resistance 22 3d p based interfacial polymerization has recently been added to the water treatment tech 22 3d p can make things that aren t easy to get stuck to more selective or are more water permeable 23 the old manufacturing methods in treating water were used to create a wide range of tools until 1980 new manufacturing technologies such as 3d p that deposit materials layer by layer were developed in the early 1980s resulting in a rise in the growth of both production and the technology that supports it over time 24 fused deposition modeling fdm printers were the first 3d printers to use a laser beam light to fuse powdered material 24 25 stereolithography sla was developed by alain le méhauté olivier de witte and jean claude andré to advance the technology further 26 sla a vat printing technology uses ultraviolet uv light to photopolymerize liquid polymers resulting in the formation of solids 27 chuck hull built stereolithography files into a new 3d technology he later patented and commercialized the creation of a 3d printer by chuck hull patented in 1976 signified the beginning of contemporary industrial manufacturing 28 before the printing process translating geometric designs into standard triangle language stl files is proceeded through computer aided design cad software as shown in fig 1 a b structures extending from the most basic to the most complex may be created using computer aided design cad the slicing process begins immediately after the cad software generates the stl file 29 a file containing the model s cross sectional layers is prepared using 3d p software and then submitted to a 3d printer 28 3d scanning enables replicating existing products and other approaches to speed up production with cad based model preparation in a nutshell 3d p is advantageous for ecologically friendly environments because of its low waste manufacturing technique and low chemical exposure strategy this study aims to provide a comprehensive and brief overview of 3d p and membrane printing technologies in water purification and nanofiltration applications 30 specifically an in depth overview of numerous 3d p procedures in membrane technology and filtration frameworks were explored it evaluates the possible application directions for manufacturing methods in conjunction with h2o purification technologies based on the literature it concludes with a list of limits and predictions for their prospective practicality and scalability as part of our research we look at some of the most critical aspects of technology that could help us figure out how to use 3d p technology for water treatment in the future 2 classification nowadays manufacturing utilizes various 3d p methods which may be grouped into liquid based powder based and solid based classifications liquid based 3d p technologies are the most common the methods of cutting and joining photo curing joining binding melting and solidifying may also be characterized even since they are defined according to the sort of printing medium they employ introduction of the stereolithography apparatus sla in 3d p 26 several unique techniques have been established included in fig 2 new innovations such as two or multiphoton polymerization also known as 2pp mpp which use photopolymer mediated nonlinear photon absorption have also been categorized 3d p can be divided into 7 kinds according to the american society for testing and materials astm as shown in table 1 30 2 1 scientific applications of 3d p devices for distillation in recent years an upsurge in research has been observed on the development of 3d p in various sectors from engineering technology to life science which has been advantageous environmental research and engineering are beginning to reap the benefits of 3d p 31 miniature devices for toxicity control and environmental evaluations and certain specialized components of water cleaning are being developed using the 3d p method among other applications 12 since research on membrane modules was conducted before using this technology for water cleaning methods the production of membranes is a relatively recent field of study consequently the present study investigates the potential for 3d p to be employed in the production of water treatment desalination membranes are manufactured as thin layers or cylindrical strands lengthy extremely thin rods depending on their intended purpose 12 modules can be manufactured by stacking these membranes and packing them into tubes the most prevalent membrane module designs for reverse osmosis ro systems are hollow fiber and spiral wound membranes swm 32 33 in the design of membrane modules hollow fiber membranes are the most often used kind of membrane sheet and frame modules rotary modules cylindrical modules oscillating modules and cubic vortex are some of the other kinds of modules 34 since its inception in reverse osmosis swm has gained significant acceptance in seawater desalination outpacing hollow fiber membrane modules in profitability and desirability 34 35 swm provides an optimal balance between operational fouling control efficiency and packing density needs the study would benefit from reviewing prior research that has been conducted on 3d p in the creation of module and membrane designs 2 2 3d p in membranes fabrication and spacer design the membranes in the swm module are isolated from one another by carriers which are referred to as spacers because of the way it is manufactured fig 3 to keep membranes apart and provide flow channels it has been recommended that feed spacers which have the appearance of net like structures be placed between membranes this will improve swm modules fluid mixing and overall efficiency by keeping them apart and providing flow channels 36 the stiffness of the membrane sheets must be chosen throughout the manufacturing process to sustain the membrane sheets without harming the membrane sheets furthermore since the feed spacers must be wrapped around the central permeate tube to be functional they cannot be too stiff to do their job correctly polypropylene pp is the most often used material in the manufacturing of spacers because of its elasticity and exceptional chemical resistivity pp spacers are used in various medical devices aerospace and automotive applications 37 several analyses had conducted to determine the influence of various feed spacer characteristics including morphological features on their effectiveness in water purification 38 when using traditional manufacturing processes like injection molding or thermal extrusion the intricacy of spacer designs has proved to be a stumbling barrier 39 previous efforts to create innovative membrane spacers with optimum performance depended heavily on computer simulations to accomplish their goals over the last several years several 3d p technologies have been employed to generate feed spacer components and other parts 40 aside from that the advent of 3d printing has made creating complex geometrical structures more efficient as a result scientists were inspired to employ 3d p to build new feed spacers that overcome manufacturing constraints table 2 summarizes the various types of 3d printed spacers used in water filtration 2 2 1 spacer fabrication via sls as far as we know li et al were the first to investigate the fabrication of membrane spacers using 3d printing which was the first of its type 14 years ago and they were the first to do so 41 furthermore they not only established novel spacers but also emphasized enhancing mass transfer inside the spacer filled channels throughout all stages of the spacers design and development using the selective laser sintering sls process the titanium spacers were cut with a laser before being assembled investigations were conducted to test 3 distinct spacers geometries generated all of which were examined using the limiting current technique in addition the mass transfer rate of the spacers was determined as the researchers discovered in their experiments the geometry of spacers influences their effectiveness in membrane separation procedures and multilayered spacers excelled both helically coiled tubes and modified fiber spacers when it came to performing membrane separation tan et al also fabricate and analyze spacers using the sls method besides thomas et al and sreedhar 42 43 tan et al optimized various process parameters including sheet width temperature and scan structure density utilizing the sls technique 42 additional measurements and analyses were performed on the spacer prototypes including fracture toughness elastic modulus and dimension accuracy pre treating printing materials and sophisticated printing techniques have been proposed in a number of studies to overcome the dimensional inaccuracies of sls technology to increase mechanical attributes tpms topologies according to thomas et al have been explored for their effect on feed spacers fabricated using the sls method 43 compared to commercial feed spacers they have increased the heat transfer coefficient when employed in membrane distillation significantly improving over conventional feed spacers this is due to the interpenetrating structures of the feed spacers which are responsible for this sreedhar and colleagues research on feed spacers for biofouling mitigation aimed to increase spacer efficacy for membrane filtration applications 44 biofouling deposition on 3d printed spacers and membrane was reduced compared to conventional feed spacers 45 2 2 2 spacer fabrication via fdm a new generation of spacer architectures including ladder like structures herringbones and helices were manufactured utilizing fused deposition modeling techniques 46 47 shrivastava et al were particularly interested in investigating the impact of different shaped spacers on concentration polarization and how they may use the knowledge to advance the efficiency of the reverse osmosis process 38 48 a study indicated that helical spacers were the most efficient in terms of enhancing mass transfer 47 they were followed by laddered spacers and finally herringbone spacers completed the pattern another study carried out by kerdi et al investigated the possibility of modifying the feed spacer made using a stereolithography device by perforation to reduce the membrane fouling effect and boost filter flow 49 50 before conducting an experiment computational fluid dynamics cfd is utilized to investigate the perforation effects on local hydrodynamics of the perforated spacers hole perforation was found to have the maximum permeate flow and the most considerable flux 75 at constant pressure consistent feed flow conditions resulted in the maximum permeate flux of 23 51 thus considerable innovative research has indicated the manufacturing of 3dp composite spacers via fdm such as tio2 with polylactichydroxyapatite polyetheretherketone or polycarbonate 20 recent studies have shown that am structures can be used to remediate wastewater polymer zeolite composite structures helped in reducing ammonia accumulation in water 52 hence employing am to create and analyze photoelectrocatalytic reactors for operation and customization can assist in developing architectures that suit site specific requirements the use of buoyant nanostructures to optimize photocatalysts in the photosensitive domain overcomes the limitations of loose granules or slurries that would otherwise gather and collapse lowering overall efficiency 3d p allows easy recovery of catalysts from complicated environmental media preventing harmful residual emissions and potential effects on the environment andrew d mcqueen and his colleagues investigated the photocatalytic ability of tio2 embedded into 3d printable polymer polylactic acid pla via fdm to purify sediment containing organic contamination e g polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah attained from a confined disposal facility cdf pahs have been chosen due to their potential aquatic toxicity in these sediments and photodegradation possibility fig 4 a the benefit of integrating photocatalyst into a 3dp pla is that one can ensure specific targeting of stabilized tio2 in the photosensitive domain restricting settlement and aggregation while avoiding contamination the 3d printed pla tio2 samples disintegrated compounds of pahs in polluted water the pla tio2 composite in a circular disc form as shown in fig 4 b i was printed with nearly 8 cm diameter and 1 mm width the sem images of the 3dp disc confirm the presence of tio2 aggregates observable at or near the surface fig 4 b ii the pah dark analysis shows no significant degradation or contamination decline within 6 h however uv exposure tio2 settled powder and 3d printed pla tio2 disc show significant degradation in pah concentrations after 1 to 6 h of treatment fig 4 c confirming that embedding the photocatalysis in polymer does not eliminate its efficacy achieving nondetectable pah concentrations within hours to days tio2 integrations with inorganic oxides improved photocatalytic degradation under visible light such as tio2 graphene composites ti zno cr2o3 cu n doped tio2 and ti zno composites 53 54 2 2 3 spacer fabrication via polyjet printing siddiqui et al used a membrane fouling simulator msf found that 3d p spacers improved hydrodynamics while reducing biofouling 55 56 as a starting point they compared the geometrical properties of a 3d polyjet printed spacer to those of a traditional spacer with the same geometrical parameters the accumulation of biomass the hydrodynamic behavior and the reduction in pressure were all comparable as a consequence of numerical comparison a redesigned spacer design was devised which resulted in a smaller pressure drop over time and a reduction in biomass accumulation in their research they observed that by utilizing numerical modeling and real testing of spacers built using 3d technology they could design improved spacers that might potentially boost membrane performance however polyjet fabrication of spacers is considered adequate due to the lower cost and higher resolution of the spacers generated by other 3d p procedures 57 fdm and sla printing were determined to be ineffective in printing spacers as fdm created brittle spacers having wider filaments than the original model while sla generated spacers with weaker fracture toughness and mechanical characteristics than the intended design 3 3d p membranes application 3 1 3d p membranes via sls in anti biofouling applications 3d p is currently cumbersome to synthesize thin layers researchers started by investigating how the technology may be used to membrane module components for anti biofouling as a result considerable improvements were concentrated on module studies 58 using sls printer and modeling researchers fabricate filament twisted plates and multi layer spacers having regular filaments using twisted tapes according to the findings of this research computation fluid mechanics cfm can be unreliable due to the complex configuration of the filaments 59 it is observed that twisted structures and modified filaments show less productivity while multi layer alignments have the potential to improve performance this contrasts with prior computational fluid dynamics investigations since those investigations a plethora of research has been conducted to develop novel design techniques for membrane feed spacers 38 40 inspite of the fact that some research has been dependent on alterations of commercially available designs i e deviating the angle configurations i e triply periodic minimal surface spacers tpms as shown in fig 5 a the enhanced interaction of film with the fluid and the water mixing resulted in a considerable improvement in process performance additionally total organic carbon toc biofouling is significantly decreased due to using this novel form of a spacer 60 while the gyroid sk type tmps spacer significantly reduced toc on membranes surface by 91 schwarz p sk and clp sh spacers significantly reduced toc on membranes surface by 65 and 46 respectively fig 5 a 61 the spacers exhibited no mechanical deformation during the operation suggesting their commercial use a pressure drop also decreases as a result of the use of tpms spacers the best performance was achieved by the schwarz p sk which had 12 5 less pressure drop than the commercial spacer a transverse clp spacer was developed by the same research group and used in the membrane distillation md process compared to commercially available net type spacers the transverse clp spacer increased flow by 60 a significant step forward in membrane science has been made possible by developing honeycomb shaped membrane supports using 3d p it has been mainly designed for use with fo membranes so this spacer is the first of its kind fig 5 b in manufacturing electrodialysis ed membranes another 3d printed spacer was used as a support structure using 3d p technologies bai et al created five different spacers to increase the stack voltage limiting current density lcd and pressure drop of ed equipment porous spacers were designed using an fdm and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs filament with minor weave pattern faults 64 the fifth spacer with modified cubic parts had the greatest lcd which was 2 0 3 5 times larger than the lcd of the non spacer particularly spacer 2 has non usable performance when the pressure drops by 5 kpa some studies have focused not only on the geometry of the spacers but also on the substance of the spacers and the influence of the 3d p procedure on the spacers yanar and choi et al investigated the impact of abs polypropylene pp and polylactic acid pla 62 63 they discovered that the printing materials had comparable fouling water flux and mechanical strength to the spacer fig 5 c d 63 autodesk meshmixer and blender were used to create the 3d spacer model for this project 3d p is also an excellent tool for introducing new technologies that are merging vibrating spacers for example are an example of this tan et al and wu et al synthesize vibrating spacers using 3d p 37 42 65 fault mitigation for flat type membranes was improved due to the higher shear rate and turbulence generated by the new type of spacer design research on 3d p spacers is at an early stage it is necessary to evaluate the suitability of 3d p spacers for use in desalination and water purification 2 12 furthermore spiral wound modules are used to construct most membrane modules due to their superior efficiency armbruster et al examined tubular membranes to minimize the fouling on ceramic membranes 66 using a polyjet 3d p a photosensitive acrylate based polymer as a printing medium and a second polymer as support material were manufactured by polymers fabricating the static mixers 66 67 the group developed aerating static mixers to decrease tubular membrane filtration fouling incorporating air sparging and static mixing the group subsequently improved this technology a crucial difficulty for hollow fiber membranes is the buildup of a preserved component on the film s surface which may result in a considerable reduction in mass transfer efficiency it is necessary to formulate the most effective design for momentum adsorption during the extrusion process as a result spinneret design and manufacture are crucial elements to address this issue luelf et al used 3d p to construct a variety of spinnerets with varying shapes 68 al shimmery created composite membranes with enhanced antifouling properties by depositing a thin selective layer on 3d wavy structured supports 69 3 2 3d p membranes via fdm dlp in oil water separation applications another novel use of membrane system technology is the 3d p of microfluidic crossflow filtration systems developed by wardrip et al to show fouling research viability the microfluidic technology operates more effectively and may result in cheaper pricing for foulants and chemicals 70 3d p of a two membrane single pass module was also employed to fabricate another filtering system as of right now the majority of module studies are still relying on simulations researchers may use 3d p to confirm further their data for already completed research projects which is a tremendous opportunity despite the fact the construction of the entire membrane by 3d p has been limited in the past there have recently been several significant investigations that began with an oil water separation membrane as described by lv et al in their pioneering work and progressed from there to other applications they developed superhydrophobic porous membranes for oil water separation and nano silica filled polydimethylsiloxane pdms ink which they used in conjunction with pdms ink 71 consequently 3d p was used to create a superhydrophobic surface on a permeable structure which prevented weak interface adhesion compared to more conventional fabrication techniques according to the researchers the highest oil water separation efficacy 99 6 is achieved with pore diameters of 0 37 mm following this investigation yuan et al conducted a study on oil water separation published in the same journal 72 a superhydrophobic polysulfone psu membrane support was created utilizing 3d p technology known as selective laser sintering to create the final 3d printed membrane performance tests were carried out on the membrane after being coated with candle soot and allowed to dry apart from water the film exhibited superhydrophobicity 161o and excellent biocompatibility additionally it demonstrated a high removal efficiency of 95 for the whole hexane water extraction even after ten operation cycles along with 3d printed polyamide membranes with superhydrophobic and superoleophilic surfaces yuan et al developed superhydrophobic and underwater superoleophilic surfaces by roughening porous and micro nanostructural zeolitic imidazolate frameworks 72 73 when paired with an oil flow 24 000 lmh this approach produced 99 oil rejection three dimensional 3d printing has also been employed to develop curvilinear structures for oil water separation membranes 74 saeed m and his colleagues enhanced the cleanability permeability and fouling build up characteristics of the 3d p composite layers 75 it was shown that permeance recovery was 52 greater and oil rejection rates were 96 higher the permeability of pure water and the recovery of permeance increased by 87 and 53 respectively li et al have offered different techniques including a 3d printed oleophilic and superhydrophobic self floating membrane 76 these oil water separation investigations are complemented by some promising research on other kinds of water treatment membranes such as ion exchange and electrochemical chromatography recent research has focused on utilizing 3d p support for nanofiber casings poly methyl methacrylate graft poly dimethylsiloxane pmma g pdms copolymer and polyamide 6 were used to produce electrospun nanofiber membranes which were then printed in three dimensions 77 additionally 3d p technology may recreate structures inspired by nature which yang et al used to develop an efficient oil water separation solution 78 it was recently discovered that this kind of biomimetic technique might be used for membrane production in the work of xing et al using an fdm printer and was intended for use in oil water separation 79 80 with a pore size of 250 mm it was possible to achieve a separation efficiency of 99 4 79 while other researchers have used this method to print polymeric membranes for water purification hwa et al used it to construct ceramic membranes for water purification clay powders with particle sizes of 75 150 and 250 mm were utilized to produce 3d printed membranes with particle sizes ranging from 75 to 250 mm this was due to the small particles ability to capture larger sized contaminants using 3d p ray and colleagues developed another unique way to produce ceramic membranes the team used the solvent based slurry stereolithography 3s approach the 3s technique varies from conventional 3d p technologies in that it uses an indirect manufacturing strategy rather than direct production the 3s procedure varies from conventional 3d p processes in that it takes an indirect manufacturing approach in which the sintering process accomplishes densification after the green pieces have been 3d printed using alumina material based membranes the researchers could create membranes for ultrafiltration yaoyao ye and his colleagues manufactured double layer ceramic membranes comprising separation and support layers for oil water separation 81 the separation stratum possesses microsized patterns having wavy half cylindrical and triangular morphology the support layer comprises homogenous pores throughout the layer a highly precise design can be generated by regulating the dye percentage of the solution and the optical power density of the printer an oil in water mixture containing 100 mg l oil is processed using a half cylindrical membrane to attain 82 oil rejection 81 layer by layer curing takes place via lowering the platform in a slurry using sunk dlp printer as shown in fig 6 a the membrane fabrication procedure and 3dp filtration structure having wavy cylindrical and triangle patterns are shown in fig 6 b possessing 50 mm diameter of separation and porous layers having 40 μm and 1 54 mm thickness with a total surface area of 1951 mm2 2294 mm2 2370 mm2 additional slurries from 3dp membranes were removed via ultrasonication in water and ethanol fig 6 c i displays sem images to evaluate 3dp layer morphology displaying surface patterns and the support layer s surface pores 150 μm average pore size the pore configuration including size surface area and volume are significant parameters in the filtration mechanism of membranes a half cylindrical 3dp membrane demonstrates a water flux of 145 l m2 h bar having a pore range of 183 nm to 119 μm distributed fig 6 d i shows that the permeate flux as a function of time which shows the permeate flux across the ceramic membrane decreases from 97 to 53 l m2 h bar after an hour reaching a stable flux of 53 l m2 h bar exhibiting oil rejection coefficient r up to 82 performing better treatment for water purification similarly zhipeng jin and his colleagues synthesize a ceramic membrane with a gradient pore structure possessing superhydrophobic superoleophilic properties using 3dp the gradient pore structure manages a flow rate of up to 25 434 l m2h approximately 40 higher than a straight pore structure at 200 c performance was maintained at 97 4 82 table 3 described 3d printed flexible nanofibrous membranes utilized for oil water mixture separation via different techniques exhibiting 95 efficiency although there has been some development in 3d p research there has been minimal progress toward developing devices that can manufacture elastomeric or porcelain membranes nowadays presented printing constituents are regarded to be the focus of most membrane research which are not particularly successful when utilized for filtering purposes when applied to membranes likewise the expansion of printers capable of adjusting the quantity of blended nanoparticles serves an important demand particularly for polymeric membranes as previously stated the development of 3d p expertise to accomplish flawless production of the entire sheath is still in its early stages researchers are looking at printing techniques on membrane surfaces and 3d p of gel or solvent on the layers surface more plausible studies based on current technology due to a risk of failure in the absence of scientific incorporation amid research and 3d p technology 3 3 3d p membranes in photocatalytic and desalination applications environmental protection awareness has resulted in several high efficacy catalytic materials with precise structural characteristics particularly in the study disciplines of photocatalytic degradation electrocatalysis and other related domains increased attention has recently been drawn to the strong relationship between catalyst shape and photocatalytic activity 3d printing monolithic catalysts can effectively handle the confined surface area complex production techniques and severe pore destabilization induced by rapid temperature variations catalysts were split into multiple portions of the catalyst structure to perform complex reactions using the highly tailored distribution of catalytic materials by 3d printing utilization of this technique in the manufacture of microreactors is also conceivable the catalyst component is housed in the printed catalytic structure which also controls the flow of reactants sla among the most popular methods of the 3d p process is particularly well suited for solidifying resin for dye degradation patterned resins may be solidified by varying the length and intensity of irradiation and attaching to a platform or surface consequently the desired structure was created in layers rather than in one piece the need for wide ranging industrial use and concern for environmentally friendly synthesis specify a significant obstacle to the development of a novel catalyst system recently flake reinforcement specimens with three different periodic holes have been generated using sla and sintered in n2 to form carbon ceramic reinforcement to strengthen the resin al2o3 and sio2 particles were included in the polymeric solution and air conditioned ceramic support was also made as a comparison pore size distribution and the micromorphology of the material are greatly influenced by the presence of pyrolyzed carbon resulting in a highly complex microstructure with huge pores a molybdenum disulfide mos2 layer is applied to the surface of the sintered carbon ceramic support or on the ceramic support array patterns and pyrolyzed carbon from n2 protection were studied to see how they affected the photodegradation effectiveness of mos2 several points were raised about the catalyst support system s stability and effectiveness in absorbing light sla has three different geometric array patterns seen in fig 7 the structure of each is shown 99 some light particles spread by the scattered light spots adhered to the wall distorting its boundaries when printing adhesion between adjacent layers may be seen on the support because of the added inorganic nanoparticles in the slurry the laser lost its ability to produce patterns with a circular arc and a sharp angle during printing this new bioinspired carbon support can be made more precisely and faster than previous biomorphic carbon support work it has a considerable advantage over conventional production approaches in terms of customization carbon reinforcements from the photo curable epoxy were made by sintering at 1400 c in n2 while ceramic supports were produced by sintering in air the photocurable resin was protected from degradation by the n2 environment and the amount of pyrolyzed carbon was determined to be 12 86 2 32 wt fig 7 depicts the microstructure of the carbon support which shows how intricate and densely packed it was the micropores decreased to a diameter of 5 μm and had a remarkable uniformity of size distribution across the specimen the protrusions and chip like structure were firmly packed on the support s surface sintering is prevented by pyrolyzed carbon which prevents the mass transfer of ceramic powder resulting in the development of this shape and structure a considerable pressure gradient was not created to break through the surface additionally graphitization enhances the conductivity of pyrolyzed carbon making it simpler to separate photogenerated electron hole pairs as previously explained the laser s circular arc and acute angle features were lost because the laser was scattered by the matrix composites in the slurry the sintering procedure induced significant shrinkage of the material during the thermal treatment square matrix patterning revealed an ideal adsorption performance of 41 37 while the other two arrays exceeded 35 under similar thermal conditions the catalytic efficiency of the catalyst was influenced by the geometrical array design and the carbon concentration of the sintering environment this demonstrated that ceramic support exhibited no deteriorating qualities and adsorption had reached a saturation level of 3 91 after 60 min of incubation photodegradation efficiency of ceramic support with square array increased to 45 95 from 23 35 in contrast the photodegradation efficiency of ceramic support with circular array and diamond array increased to 36 30 and 28 95 which was significantly lower than ceramic support with a square collection although carbon supports experienced a significant improvement in photodegradation efficiency ceramic supports only observed a 5 78 photodegradation efficiency when used in the same geometric array arrangement as a result all three array designs significantly boosted their overall efficiency when their mos2 content was fixed the dispersion of the agglomerated catalyst which required the application of light from a single direction was a significant contributing component the pore was made more complicated by adding pyrolyzed carbon which gave the catalyst a higher chance of attaching itself to it in contrast partially pyrolyzing carbon resulted in partial graphitization resulting in graphite formation with good conductivity besides extraordinarily high photodegradation efficiency catalyst materials utilized in industrial production must also exhibit exceptional stability mos2 photodegradation efficiency declined considerably after two cycles reaching around 87 65 after three cycles and stabilizing at roughly 82 55 after five cycles following carbon support loading this study shows an overall trend toward improved photocatalytic activity on rhb dye degradation after three cycles due to loss of catalyst mass that occurs during the stirring process the photodegradation performance after cycles may be diminished hence 3d printing technology can produce complex and precise structures that can be adjusted and carefully controlled without needing the expensive manufacturing process required by prior approaches resulting in comparatively affordable prices 3d printing on the other hand has significant downsides such as mechanical density and weak impact resistance implying that the catalysts would be unable to endure external pressures while still retaining photocatalytic efficiency aside from melting or sintering or bonding during the printing process causing the breakdown of the functional structure catalysts may also be destroyed furthermore immobilization of the catalyst has the added benefit of improving reaction performance and increasing catalyst recovery the enhanced chemical thermal and mechanical durability of catalyst materials has resulted in a greater catalytic efficiency from support it can be widely used in industrial production only after the catalyst is linked to the support currently the powder condition of the catalyst causes insufficient performance owing to aggregation which is a key constraint of catalyst used as the catalyst s performance and structure are intertwined its recyclability and stability fall short of actual manufacturing requirements for this reason 3d p holds the promising capability to fabricate precise functional structures for catalysts because it can be used to deposit the catalyst onto porous support with a wide surface area 3 4 floating 3d p catalyst for organic contaminants degradation nowadays our society is more concerned about environmental contamination particularly water pollution pharmaceutical products are classified as contaminants of emergent concern cec because they have a refractory character and are difficult to remove from a system or environment it is necessary to develop new treatment procedures to degrade specific organic contaminants it is commonly recognized that heterogeneous photocatalysis with supported tio2 is a reliable method that has been extensively proven this context lends itself to the use of tio2 photocatalysis for cecs extraction from wastewater the presence of a floating catalyst having a lower density than water has the additional benefit of making tio2 reachable to uv rays primarily if that radiation is emitted by the sun and often contaminants may be seen floating on the water surface i e oil pollutants to attain high surface area bifunctional material from waste cork certain members have expertise in making floating adsorbents photocatalysts which have both adsorbents and photocatalytic capabilities in the course of wastewater treatment cork might come loose reducing the system s effectiveness overall low density polyethylene ldpe may be a suitable substrate for floating photocatalysts because it has a lesser density than water and is very stable and resistant to degeneration these floating catalysts glass or polymeric have been explored to eliminate various contaminants tio2 is included in commercial substrates of globular shape or configuration having a low surface to volume ratios which is a noteworthy drawback for surface procedures the use of commercial or lab prepared substrates restricts a number of configurations that may be used 3d p permits creating highly varied geometries that cannot be attained via traditional processing plastics molding injection etc seeking high surface volume ratios this constraint may be overcome according to stefanov et al some studies have been done to remove organic impurities via 3d p photocatalysts 100 hernández afonso et al and skorski et al used ceramics and acrylonitrile butadiene synthetic supports for wastewater purification 101 102 however since these supports aren t floating it s possible that the process efficiency might be enhanced by creating 3d printed floating catalysts that make use of the benefits of floating supports in light of this this investigation determines to explore photo catalytic removal of ofloxacin c18h20fn3o4 an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections from wastewater as a model for cecs zhang et al studied the anatase phase to improve the catalytic activity 103 tio2 is dispersed in ldpe as an extruding agent by mixing the two materials in a cylindrical mixer or employing o xylene or a commercial anionic surfactant to disperse the tio2 particles before extrusion in addition 3d printing of ldpe tio2 meshes increased the surface area of the catalyst compared to a standard ldpe tio2 plate methylene blue was first used to test operating conditions and assess the technology s efficiency the elimination of ofloxacin was then carried out based on the results of this earlier assessment as shown in fig 8 several catalysts may be prepared preparation of the ldpe tio2 plate was done utilizing a cylinder mixer cm guix cylinder temperature of 160 c 104 this plate served as a benchmark for the activity the materials supplied to the extruder were produced by mixing granulated ldpe with tio2 in the presence of o xylene or an anionic surfactant ldpe tio2 o xylene and ldpe tio2 surfactant 3d printing was used to shape the ejected filaments square mesh with a surface volume ratio of 1 mm 0 1 mm was chosen as an adequate morphology for the project the extruder was a filafab pro 350 ex extrusion 235 c nozzle 194 c nozzle diameter 1 75 mm a bed temperature of 45 c an extruder temperature 200 c and a printing speed of 1000 mm were employed in the 3d printing process thus floating photocatalysis allows improved access to uv radiation ofloxacin a model of cec was successfully removed from synthetic wastewater increasing the photocatalyst s active surface increases catalytic activity ldpe tio2 meshes were made using various methods including mixing the two materials or dispersing them with o xylene or anionic surfactant 105 filaments were extruded and utilized to produce meshes during 3d printing errors of 10 were found in the procedure and catalyst activity remained the same after being recycled three times for the first time researchers have found a way to cure pollutants like cecs in situ using photocatalysts and sunlight a promising approach because of its cheap cost and facile implantation 3 5 3d printed residential solar water disinfection applications according to a un study issued in 2015 663 million individuals worldwide lack access to clean water 106 many tenants cannot afford to pay for municipally cleaned water even in regions where it is easily accessible according to the gates foundation around 700 000 children die from diarrhea each year water treatment options for the home that are inexpensive ecologically benign easy to set up and simple to use are in critical need of development sodis solar disinfection of drinking water is a water treatment system that involves exposing a transparent water container such as a plastic bottle to direct sunlight for an extended period this leads to the deactivation of microbes chiefly caused by dna damage produced by ultraviolet uv radiation and contact with reactive oxygen species ros uv light and ros interaction are the most common causes of dna damage in terms of water treatment sodis is a low cost and uncomplicated technology still it requires a significant amount of time with disinfection periods of up to 48 h necessary for some instances 106 the rate of water disinfection may be significantly amplified by developing photocatalysts to produce more reactive oxygen species ros which can then be used to disinfect the water 107 an electron hole pair is formed when a photon impacts a catalyst with an energy larger than or equal to the catalyst bandgap this enables catalysts to react with water and dissolved oxygen to generate ros that is harmful to microbes such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals it has been shown that the ros approach can produce a high rate of water disinfection when using tio2 zno and mos2 as active ingredients 107 108 it is essential to develop a reliable catalyst immobilization technique for these materials before being employed in practical applications which is one of the most significant obstacles to widespread usage it is essential to establish long term immobilization of catalyst material to reduce the amount of catalyst that leaks into drinking water as previously discussed a complicated filtering operation is required to extract nano sized catalyst particles from treated water making the whole process costly and inefficient the use of tio2 thoroughly investigated non toxic catalysts available may assist in mitigating the risks associated with release into the environment tio2 when doped with carbon sulfur nitrogen or hydrogen is capable of collecting light in the ultraviolet and visible bands and it may be utilized to limit the likelihood of environmental release given the unknown health consequences and bad taste of titania particles in drinking water these particles must be eliminated it is necessary to process sodis for up to 48 h since it is based on microbial inactivation induced by solar radiation in the ultraviolet uv spectrum photocatalytic materials like titanium dioxide which captures sunlight and accelerates the creation of reactive oxygen species ros that inactivate bacteria within a few hours may dramatically boost the pace of water treatment in most water treatment systems one major obstacle to the incorporation of photocatalysts is the need for the catalyst particles to be embedded in a 3d configuration having a large surface area that is stable underneath the water current researchers developed the am technique for titanium and proposed an effectual solar water disinfection method centered on architected tio2 that does not need costly catalyst filtration the titanium monomers are produced by ligand interchange reaction among titanium alkoxide and acrylic acid to generate a pre ceramic titanium photoresist that may be printed on ceramic surfaces a commercial stereolithography system is then used to create sophisticated 3d constructions subsequently pyrolyzed to eliminate any remaining organic material from the structures energy dispersive spectroscopy measurements near the structure s surface reveal that it has a chemical composition of 46 ti 31 o and 23 c which is around 40 less in size than the structure as it was originally manufactured eds the 3d structures having sporadic cubic and octet configurations were constructed using this technology with unit cells ranging in size 0 65 to 1 14 mm beam lengths ranging from 115 to 170 mm and relative densities ranging from 11 to 31 the microstructure of these lattices as shown by transmission electron microscopy tem is nanocrystalline titania rutile with a mean grain size of 60 nm this is consistent with the findings of previous research this cubic titania micro lattice has a density of 350 365 kg m3 and mechanical studies indicate compressive strengths of up to 4 3 mpa which is many times higher than the compressive values recorded for titania foams of similar density finally the established am method can be fine tuned to minimize carbon content while still producing components with a titanium content of 99 9 by weight thus it exhibits that proposed titania is used to fabricate effective and economical photocatalytic reactors in domestic water disinfection besides in photocatalytic h2 production co2 conversion and tissue engineering among other things the immobilization of tio2 under the effect of water flow is a significant technical problem as supports for titania various solid substrates have been investigated including carbon particles silica particles glass fibers or sand the introduction of a secondary material decreases available catalytic surface area it restricts reactant s mass transfer resulting in a considerable decline in the overall efficiency of the process using heat treatment of sol gel derived tio2 in the coating of a template material which is readily disrupted during the coating process raises the danger of contamination self supported titania foams have had limited success because of the risk of the foam breaking and leaking material into the water using additive manufacturing am this study proposes a technique for creating sturdy self sustaining 3d photocatalytic tio2 structures to build practical reactors for residential solar water disinfection applications hand agitation was used to mix acrylic acid 17 3 g and titanium iv ethoxide 13 7 g in a glove box fig 9 a i a yellow to orange shift in the fluid s coloration indicated a ligand exchange process in progress after that the mixture was placed in a vacuum chamber for 15 min to remove any leftover ethanol residue on an autodesk ember 3d printer utilizing stereolithography to build up a titanium rich photoresist in layers of 25 μm fig 9 a ii several diverse geometries of structures were printed each with a different amount of uv exposure time 14 s for the initial layer nine seconds for the next four layers and then three seconds for the last layer following a 15 minute soak in pgmea the printed structures were washed in ipa for 10 min fig 9 b depicts the finished product of a titanium containing polymer scaffold in the last phase of this am process a tube furnace was used to pyrolyze the printed titanium containing polymer structures the temperature was raised to 1000 c at 2 c min and kept there for an hour fig 9 b ii iii illustrates typical pyrolyzed titania structures fig 7b i shows a 10 10 10 cubic lattice with unit cell dimensions these samples relative density ranged from 11 to 31 density all samples showed linear shrinkage and mass loss after being pyrolyzed in an ar 1000 c as shown in fig 9 b iii the cubic titania lattices produced had unit cell sizes between 0 66 mm and 0 01 mm and beam widths between 170 mm and 5 mm an sem image of the morphology of the pyrolysis treated octets is shown in fig 9 c at various magnifications sl printer inherent layer to layer transition patterns can be seen in fig 9 which exhibit cells and beams of uniform size with crystals ranging from 20 to 150 nm the structure s surface is coated with porous nanocrystalline 105 a titanium rich photoresist was made and a polymer derived titania am method was shown using octet and cubic morphologies a 60 nm grain titanium dioxide microstructure was found in these lattices according to findings depending on the pyrolysis conditions the titanium concentration in the resultant structure varied from 77 to 99 according to a new study 3d p titania lattices were often stronger than equivalent titania foams of the same density architected photocatalytic devices have large surface areas and sturdy self supporting morphology having the ability to offer effective solar water disinfection without the need for costly catalyst filtration water treatment utilizing architected titania will be tested using organic pollutants and microorganisms in the future other applications include photocatalytic water splitting for h2 production scaffolds for tissue engineering fuel generation from co2 solar cells and photocatalytic water splitting desalination and long term viability depend on developing novel water treatment materials 109 although certain 3d printing techniques may provide fewer obstacles they have shown to be inappropriate for keeping up with the latest conventional membrane manufacturing technology at least for the time being the expense of 3d printed membranes equipment constraints the requirement for operational and technical skills scalability and commercial potential are some primary downsides of this technology there are two types of costs associated with 3d produced membranes the cost of a 3d printer and the printing materials used to create them although 3d printers are becoming more affordable the high cost of these devices has prevented their complete integration into membrane desalination systems polymer printing has also been used to print membranes throughout the course of history 110 3 6 3d p nanomembranes via inkjet printing for degradation and desalination applications the presentation of inkjet printing develops new techniques for synthesizing selective layers of water cleaning using inkjet printing technology 111 despite being extensively utilized in industry it has also been modified for use in scientific research consequently there has been a significant rise in research into biopolymer arrays organic transistors ceramics and light emitting diodes 112 inkjet printing may differ between continuous inkjet cij and drop on demand dod inkjet printing continuous inkjet printing is feasible because it generates a continuous liquid droplets stream and recycles unwanted ink via deflecting an electric field despite the fact that it is a sustainable procedure the recycling step is associated with the danger of contamination as a result of exposure to air in contrast to the cij kind the dod type does not form droplets continuously therefore there is no risk of impurity from ink cartridges inkjet printing was initially used to generate 3d p polymers and nanomaterials uf membranes in particular have been the subject of much investigation 112 113 they created checkerboard patterns in black and white and applied an inkjet printing to fluorine containing diamine monomer to a uh membrane presoaked in mpd aqueous solution consequently it was achieved that improved proficiency for the membrane is achieved marking the first attempt to create tfc membranes having physical characteristics using printing aided fabrication researchers achieved improved salt removal by using a patterned fluorinated diamine to be included in an m phenylenediamine based polyamide the research results revealed that printing technology might be used in interfacial polymerization gao et al advanced the approach by synthesizing polymeric nanomaterials such as polymeric nanotubes nanowires and thin films which they used to enhance the technology further 114 a sacrificial pattern i e polycarbonate track etched stratum must first be created and used after that the substance was applied to the template s surface using a brush nanotubes or nanowires were formed within the pores of the polycarbonate track etched membrane pcte stratum due to the presence of either polymer carbon powder metallic nanoparticles or semiconducting materials within the stratum pore toward the creation of the final shape of the membranes consequently the inkjet printed nanofiltration membranes achieved satisfactory performance in salt rejection and water flow compared to conventional membranes 115 due to having almost equal and charge domains a neutral charge was created in a mosaic membrane which boosted its permeability properties it was observed that functionalized membranes and dissolved ions had a significant impact the potassium chloride kcl enrichment was analyzed for feed solution concentrations of 1 mm and 10 mm to evaluate charge mosaic membranes ionic strength and performance a rejection rate of 17 5 1 mm feed solution and 2 0 1 6 10 mm feed solution was observed respectively indicating that the mosaic membrane could enrich the salt concentration even for these more concentrated feed solutions 115 lee and heo et al printed using inkjet on electrospun polyurethane fibrous membranes to distinguish themselves from other researchers while other researchers used silver nanoparticles bacterial resistance was shown during water purification using membranes coated with silver nanoparticles 116 bernstein and colleagues recently used inkjet printing and graft polymerization to modify thin polymeric layers the tailored layers demonstrated reduced protein fouling qualities as well as decreased biofilm formation 117 to generate ultrathin go membranes fathizadeh and colleagues employed inkjet printing 118 the fabrication of ultrathin 7 560 nm nanofiltration membranes was made possible by following these straightforward processes the 30 nm two times printed surface exhibited the highest methyl orange degradation 95 9 in comparison 15 nm single printed coating had a water permeance that was twice that of the 30 nm coating and an acceptable elimination of 83 9 a 30 nm coated double printed illustration having superior effectiveness elimination showed 76 4 80 1 83 0 and 95 2 rejection rates respectively for gemfibrozil 17α ethynylestradiol diclofenac sodium salt and iodixanol 118 this research lays the groundwork for forthcoming applications of inkjet printing to fabricate efficient water treatment membranes for drinking water treatment applications cnts in particular are renowned due to their excellent implementation as water treatment films they have previously remained effectively used in inkjet printing for cnt coating in a variety of applications including electrical devices in addition to biomimetic applications inkjet printing has a significant role surface alterations achieved by inkjet printing can convert even hydrophilic surfaces into hydrophobic structures in spite of the fact that it has not yet been used in membrane production the work conducted by zhang and colleagues offers an effective method for surface reformation they developed a mussel inspired ink that included optimum dopamine to produce superhydrophobic sheets motivated by the fog collecting skills of stenocara beetles 119 using in situ polymerization superhydrophilic surfaces are turned into superhydrophobic planes and this was accomplished by forming polydopamine in the presence of water the micropatterned surface which had an arrangement extent of around 500 mm and a separation distance of approximately 1000 mm had a water collection capability of 61 8 mg cm2 h 1 from the fog which was four times more than the unmodified surface 119 this approach can be extended to inkjet printing to generate biomimetic superhydrophobic films for water purification in contrast to inkjet printing 3d p using gel or solvent inks started to use in various applications these printing forms produce a repeatable configuration on the membrane s surface that can be controlled to make g c3n4 cn sodium alginate sa ink a combination of cn nanosheets or au dispersion solution was concentrated and then mixed with a sa solution 120 a tabletop 3d printer was used to print the aerogel after it had been prepared and the designs had been programmed in advance aerogels made of au cn sa cn sa 2 1 showed increased degradation with 93 efficiency it was also discovered that increasing the cn sa percentage improved photodegradation and adsorption efficacy also innovative is electro spraying to print nanomaterials on membrane surfaces a technique that has not been used before nanofiltration films with remarkable selectivity were created by coating microfiltration membranes with go according to chen et al according to their findings organic dye rejection rates of 98 8 98 97 and 100 for methylene blue methyl orange and evans blue were acquired at the same time it also eliminated na2so4 nacl mgso4 and mgcl2 63 13 27 86 41 82 and 15 00 120 table 4 represents 3d printed flexible nanofibrous membranes employed for various organic contamination degradation in waste water via different techniques 3 7 molecularly imprinted membranes for anti fouling applications surface printing methods are very important in membrane research because layers anti fouling and selectivity characteristics were largely influenced via the thin stratums on which they are printed 137 furthermore sophisticated printing capable of producing surfaces or supports without human intervention should be regarded as a methodology to be developed further among the most application areas for surface embossing is identifying and eliminating target molecules in mixtures using photoresponsive magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer chen et al discovered sulfonamides a kind of antibiotic employed to suppress microbial contamination 138 the synthetic polymer was employed for solid phase extraction of sulfomides from water suggesting that it might be used to remove and enrich such medications in real world samples in the near future bianchi and colleagues created a molecular imprinting polymer that might be used to detect estrogen in water which is becoming an increasingly prevalent pollutant in the environment 139 the researchers advanced a strategy for recognizing and preconcentrating estrogen in water by deploying a synthetic polymer as a solid phase extraction medium and they published their results in the journal water research in 2012 this unique method according to their results produced excellent resolution moreover meng et al proved salicylic acid might be recovered from an aqueous solution using a wollastonite based imprinted polymer that was made using a surface imprinting approach and used as an adsorbent this study shows that the manufactured adsorbent demonstrated high selectivity and that salicylic acid recovery was possible 140 researchers yang et al also stated that they had developed a dibenzothiophene imprinted polymer that could be used to remove dibenzothiophene from the environment 141 it is also possible to manufacture ion imprinting polymers using surface imprinting techniques which are used to remove heavy metals from various surfaces using a thin coating of thiourea chitosan on the magnetite fan and colleagues documented the synthesis of magnetite that was utilized to extract ag ions from an aqueous solution 142 compared to non imprinted thiourea chitosan beads the performance of ag i imprinted magnetic thiourea chitosan beads ag tcm was better ag tcm may also be used a total of five times which was also conceivable after treatment with cd ii ion imprinted polymer iip in accordance with li et al an aqueous solution was collected for further analysis 143 to eliminate the cd ii ion from the aqueous solution iip was created in their research they observed that after being printed the cd ii ion imprinted polymer had exceptional reusability and stability adsorption of the cd ii ion resulted in the elimination of this ion quite quickly although the adsorption capacity of the material was tested six times there was no obvious decline 143 in their research milja et al publicized that they have produced surface imprinted nanospheres for the purposes of solid phase uranium extraction 144 they were able to create a chemical that was water soluble and effective in the ph range of 5 7 it also displayed a high retention capacity of 97 1 μmol g when exposed to uranium concentrations of 10 mg l chang et al showed zr iv removal from aqueous solution utilizing aqueous solution removal employing a surface imprinted amino functionalized silica gel 145 they showed that sorbent imprinted with ions had the greatest static adsorption capacity with a maximum capacity of 11 mg g the researchers successfully identified the presence of trace zirconium in wastewater and specific alloys by using the newly developed technique surface imprinting is also used to produce mims molecularly imprinted membranes used in separation and other applications the separation of six fluoroquinolones fqs using a unique surface imprinted membrane created by wang et al 2016 146 a significant surface area for separation and high selectivity for recognizing fqs were seen in the fe3o4 ccns mips when they were first made which was confirmed in the experiments the separation procedure was made more straightforward to accomplish by using an external magnetic field to assist according to them this method might be used to remove fluoroquinolones from drinking h2o supplies liu et al showed hydrophilic macroporous cellulose membrane to adsorb protein lysozyme using surface imprinting technology 147 the membrane developed not only displayed strong selective adsorption against the structurally identical protein cytochrome c but also demonstrated a very high specific surface area applying this method to extract a target protein from a complex mixture has been shown and the possibility of using it in the future is being investigated the use of imprinted polymers as water treatment materials is becoming more popular because of their predefined selectivity which allows them to remove particular constituents from wastewater while also producing water with a high degree of purity mips were being investigated as natural receptor substitutes because of ease of manufacture 67 processes used to make mip include the development of a mip complex which may be achieved by densification or curing the polymer network and the elimination of the framework from the polymeric matrix after removing the template from the system it is feasible to build nanocavities of varied sizes shapes and functional group configurations the geometry of the microcavities allows them to differentiate the appropriate template molecule from a mixture passing over an imprinted surface 148 molecular imprinting uses a template molecule monomer cross linker porogenic solvent and numerous initiators relying on the polymerization being employed to create cross linked polymer and a variety of precursors depending on the type of polymers being used since one can identify certain template molecules they may be employed in water purification to eradicate and identify a broad variety of targeted contaminants creating a 3d imprint system is also achievable because of the development of binding sites across bulk materials which is beneficial in many ways on the other hand mip is better at making binding sites for tiny template molecules than the classic bulk imprinting technique for making binding sites for bigger template molecules this is owing to the challenges of employing bigger template molecules like feasible mass transport and the template being permanently entrapped within the polymer matrix surface imprinting is a technique that creates a binding spot which may be utilized to tackle these problems easily 4 perspectives during the last several years 3d p has advanced significantly resulting in a broader range of printing materials as well as more structural complexity and accuracy in printed items other applications for 3d printing technology include the production of electrode materials biopolymers microfluidic devices and the production of traditional structural materials on the other hand nanoscale research has shown considerable potential for 3d printed water treatment membranes and filters since extensive research had been conducted at macro and micro scales the strategy of modules might be considered initially the majority of module studies have concentrated only on the manufacture of spacers 3d p would provide a realistic and adaptable answer than the study done via computer modeling furthermore the module components and pressure vessels must be constructed from environmentally friendly and biocompatible materials research into the 3d p of cellulosic materials leads to developing novel ways for producing membrane modules from low cost and environmentally friendly materials technologies like electrospraying inkjet printing and solvent gel printing on membranes surfaces might be used to substitute previous outdated and inefficient manufacturing techniques aside from that other surface applications should also be considered i e melt electrospinning writing mew 31 a revolutionary additive manufacturing approach mew employs a computer aided deposition process to design and construct micrometer thin fiber layers in a 3d printed structure oil water separation and ultrafiltration nanofiltration membranes have received a lot of attention in the field of membranes it was chowdhury et al who were the first to use 3d p to create ro uf membranes 149 this fouling resistance would be considerably improved with the addition of an active layer it is particularly crucial to research pro since this method is still in the initial phase and has to be expedited to define suitable considerations prior to being used on a large scale 150 for the time being 3d p is critical to advancing scientific discovery and discovery furthermore 3d printed cylindrical layers should be investigated as a potential replacement for the standard flat type membranes now available on the market to achieve nanoscale manufacturing for applications like water treatment membranes 3d p requires new technology recent breakthroughs in 2 p technology on the other hand have the potential to be applied to the field of membrane research one of the most significant areas of upcoming study should be biomimetic purposes given that 3d p is an excellent technique aimed at replicating biological configurations a wide range of scientific domains have already profited from the findings of this type of inquiry although 3d p is often used in water harvesting research to produce biomimetic structures it has not yet been completely converted to membrane based water purification 74 furthermore the information available from existing research does not provide enough information concerning long term performance because of this it is equally important to consider the enduring performance of 3d printed thin coatings pilot scale research might be a good way to understand this better a significant amount of further study is required to enhance the deployment of 3d printing for water purification and to widen the range of applications the post treatment of 3d p spacers is a potential exploration subject since surface irregularity has previously been established to be a significant factor in the degree of biofouling formation among other things no currently available printing medium has shown to be long lasting or trustworthy enough to merit further exploration spacers for example maybe produced using the polyjet process which is relatively inexpensive due to the fact that the photo curable resins employed in this method were sensitive to temperature and light the finished product may deteriorate over time after being exposed to them as a result photopolymer spacers will be examined for their long term effectiveness additionally lee et al explore different 3d p technologies in feed spacer fabrication such as continuous liquid interface production crip and digital light processing dlp 55 151 in addition while investigating am techniques for spacer design functionality it is essential to examine their capacity to work with several materials surface imprint embedded 3d printing is a promising solution for obtaining difficult topography when a complex topography is required the ability to improve the precision of 3d printing materials may open the door to new application areas imprinting procedures considered as more beneficial than 3d p when it comes to the fabrication of polymer based objects particularly for biologically based inspection as a result surface imprinting may be used to generate materials resistant to biofouling or effective in microbial water treatment additionally by imprinting the surface of photocatalytic materials it is possible to make use of their unique properties to increase membrane performance finally future research might concentrate on designing and optimizing novel spacers which would use a range of computational models and experimental testing it was shown that a recommended technique for developing and accessing novel feed spacers for biodegradation and amplification regulation was both cost efficient and successful 5 drawbacks there are various drawbacks to using 3d p most of which may be attributed to the current stage of technical progress 3d p processes that now available are efficient in printing with great resolution in the z dimension the x and y axes on the other hand do not have the same accuracy when it comes to membrane constructions the thickness and porosity of the membrane play a significant role consequently extreme care must be taken to ensure that the axes accuracy is precisely controlled depending on the x y precision the layer porosity is challenging to change by 3d p despite the existing accuracy in the z scale being adequate even for ultrathin membranes additional issue with the present technique is the high cost of 3d printers which is prohibitively costly fdm printers are affordable however that cannot be said of the expenses of other types of 3d printers one of the most costly printing options are high resolution printers like polyjet which are so costly that their ink is out of reach for most users another disadvantage of the present technology is the long printing time it requires despite the fact that a short time duration required for printing makes 3d p more practicable for cleaning and recycling water premature failure of membranes created utilizing the fdm manufacturing technique is possible owing to component layer delamination enhancing the frequency with which membranes must be replaced in desalination and water treatment procedures the performance of fdm printed vesicles and module assemblies is restricted because of the considerable divergence from the desired model that occurs when using fdm furthermore it is unsuitable for commercial applications due to the difficulty of printing large numbers of membranes the diversity of 3d printing processes that may be used for membrane manufacturing will need the acquisition of knowledge and competence in membrane production printed membranes for water treatment procedures might not be straightforward and prior 3d p operators may need further training in membrane module configuration to be successful in their efforts the fabrication of layers with large configurations using 3d p might be problematic since it would need a significant amount of time particularly when the needed pore diameter is about 0 1 nm or less solutions such as the creation of 3d p having several printing nozzles and laser sources that may be operational in parallel were proposed by lowe et al 152 this strategy may aid in the improvement of printing speed although it is still questionable owing to the increased related costs an analysis of spacers manufactured utilizing fdm revealed the highest deviations from the original model still spacers generated through polyjet technology were shown to be the most accurate representation of an original design pressure reduction and power consumption were the highest for fdm printed spacers and they used the most energy in comparison spacers printed using fdm demonstrated the most significant development in mass transfer reducing concentration polarization and biofouling while simultaneously increasing the critical flow of latex particles additionally the sls printed spacers demonstrated a noteworthy increase in mass transfer with the polyjet and commercial spacers trailing closely behind 153 154 aside from that the surface roughness of the 3 printed samples and commercial spacer were assessed and compared after careful examination it was discovered that the surface of the polyjet printed spacer was the roughest followed by the surface of the sls manufactured spacer the fdm printed spacer had the lowest surface roughness among the three materials tested followed by the commercial spacer in order for germs to attach themselves to rough surfaces the roughness of the surface is required the polyjet printed spacer displayed a stronger tendency for bacterial adherence than any of the other spacers evaluated before finally sls printed spacers demonstrated lessening pressure loss among the investigated materials a few scholarly publications have been published in recent years that addressed the benefits of 3d p in spacers manufacture although the field is still in its infancy 121 122 131 as a result of its ability to provide views it is expected to be used by more researchers in the future nevertheless the technology is still in its infancy as a result of the ability to analyze complex spacer geometries previously calculated using cfd and the ability to manufacture complex structures using 3d printing its applicability is expected to expand as well 155 however although research studies on 3d p are still in their early stages research and academic publications are growing as the technology progresses using 3d p technology to construct membrane modules has revolutionized the design of membrane modules 156 it is projected to reduce the energy and

so far the objective of this article is to bring the consideration of researchers and technologists to the need to speed up development as 3d p grows it will impact various other study areas durability uniformity precision the flexibility to customize and the capacity to fabricate replacement components quickly are only a few of the benefits of additive manufacturing due to sustainable low risk accurate and relatively affordable production processes 3d p will have a significant role in developing membrane research in the future however even though 3d printers have been around for a long time and have been used in various technologies in the nano area to achieve this the invention of 3d fabricated water cleaning coatings continues to be an essential objective the study shows that manufacturing thin layer components or membrane reformation is crucial to realizing customized and exact 3d printed membrane manufacture considering the current state of things we can anticipate that as 3d p technology progresses to nanoscale precision this research investigates numerous 3d printing and surface imprinting procedures and current developments in 3d printing technology to enhance the design of membrane module components 3d printed spacers were the subject of more research than 3d printed membranes which was a significant difference this is partly due to a mismatch between the resolution of 3d printing technology and the precision required to construct membranes which has been noted before in addition to being widely employed in wastewater treatment surface imprinting may also have use in water detoxification surface imprinting technologies were becoming practical for the water management process fdm and sla 3d printing were inadequate for generating spacers due to their low mechanical strength and significant deviation from specifications respectively consequently the best solutions were determined to be polyjet and sls the performance of the 3d printed spacers was superior to that of commercial spacers and they also displayed improved mass transfer and less fouling more importantly it has been shown that 3d printed membranes perform far better than standard membranes in a range of applications by employing molecular imprinting photocatalytic materials such as titanium oxide may be utilized to create membranes that have increased functioning and are

purification photodegradation 1 introduction 3d printing 3d p is not as fast as traditional manufacturing when it comes to producing materials for water desalination and purification it benefits rapid prototyping rp which is helpful in several ways 1 2 a technique for producing objects by layering them together 3d p also known as additive manufacturing am was developed in 1981 and it has since acquired broad popularity 3 since then there has been substantial growth in interest in industrial things due to the complexity and variety of ways they might work following recent technological developments it is now feasible to study the relevance of 3d p in the fabrication of new materials such as nanomaterials biological materials smart materials and membranes 3d p in addition has uses in a variety of industries including construction aerospace medicinal research and the food business to mention a few 3 4 three dimensional printing is becoming more popular in water related procedures such as wastewater treatment desalination or water purification according to recent studies 3d printing has inspired interest in manufacturing membrane modules including spiral wrapped modules swm among other applications 2 5 3d p offers production flexibility it can quickly and inexpensively fabricate complex manufacturing 5 6 however several fabricating constraints must be addressed before the 3d p of membrane module components can be improved which is why this is challenging 7 as a whole 3d p solved several challenges that have developed in the water purification domain including pressure drop concentration polarization fouling issues and inefficient mass transport among other things 8 currently research has focused on surface nanostructured imprinted materials and possibilities in water technology including solvent extraction and purification and other domains have been established 8 surface imprint embedded 3d printing has the potential to significantly enhance the manufacturing of membranes and other water filtration technologies with complicated morphology since imprinting strategies appear more efficient than 3d p approaches in the formulation of polymer based technologies they are more successful at fabricating materials utilized in biofouling or microbial based water purification processes 1 9 although there are various benefits to the procedures used to synthesize molecularly imprinted polymers mips a few disadvantages include restricted mass transfer and a limit on the number of mips created aside from addressing the drawbacks associated with conventional large scale imprinting of mips procedures on polymer or substrate 5 9 global warming has become a greater danger for civilization thus the need for drinkable water has grown substantially 10 11 hence water cleaning and desalination become crucial to recycling and reusability 12 membrane nanotechnology has also acquired crucial relevance in this respect since its incredible capacity and efficiency make them an appealing choice for tackling the problem of water scarcity to meet the growing demand for high efficiency membrane surfaces 3d p was prompted to produce them quickly and precisely to fabricate them quickly and accurately 13 researchers took advantage of this by using the technology for the water energy nexus it is also critical to have precise manufacture of water treatment membrane 3d p would also make it feasible to create strong and thin membranes with consistent pore diameters 14 layer by layering nanofabrication patterning of membrane surface may be used to obtain a well organized pore size and a robust structure in addition to accurate or speedy fabrication 3d p for membrane manufacturing is significant since it allows for more economical and less wasteful production 15 thermally induced phase separation non solvent induced phase separation and vapor induced separation have emerged as widely used membrane production techniques 15 since these procedures need substantial solvent volume they generate enormous amounts of hazardous waste and contribute to environmental damage 15 it is well known that monomers used in membrane production are poisonous that may have severe consequences on human health 16 furthermore mixing these poisonous compounds with water during the membrane production development results in 50 billion liters of wastewater annually which is significant 17 considering the emissions created to clean 50 billion liters of wastewater shipping the manufactured product and the isolation packs becomes an even more noticeable cause of concern 17 18 on top of that the production associated with these traditional technologies leads to a substantial amount of waste being generated 17 19 when 3d p technology became commercially available it completely changed the manufacturing industry because it could make precise and consistent things while being environmentally friendly 18 this technology has been used in water treatment membrane research and other fields of science reducing the number of solvents that are wasted and as a result reducing the amount of carbon dioxide released during making the membranes 20 at the moment a lot of attention is paid to the fabrication of membrane modules 21 nanomaterials have been printed on the membrane surface for high selectivity and low fouling resistance 21 this has helped membrane surface research use inkjet printing to improve surface attributes such as selectivity and fouling resistance 22 3d p based interfacial polymerization has recently been added to the water treatment tech 22 3d p can make things that aren t easy to get stuck to more selective or are more water permeable 23 the old manufacturing methods in treating water were used to create a wide range of tools until 1980 new manufacturing technologies such as 3d p that deposit materials layer by layer were developed in the early 1980s resulting in a rise in the growth of both production and the technology that supports it over time 24 fused deposition modeling fdm printers were the first 3d printers to use a laser beam light to fuse powdered material 24 25 stereolithography sla was developed by alain le méhauté olivier de witte and jean claude andré to advance the technology further 26 sla a vat printing technology uses ultraviolet uv light to photopolymerize liquid polymers resulting in the formation of solids 27 chuck hull built stereolithography files into a new 3d technology he later patented and commercialized the creation of a 3d printer by chuck hull patented in 1976 signified the beginning of contemporary industrial manufacturing 28 before the printing process translating geometric designs into standard triangle language stl files is proceeded through computer aided design cad software as shown in fig 1 a b structures extending from the most basic to the most complex may be created using computer aided design cad the slicing process begins immediately after the cad software generates the stl file 29 a file containing the model s cross sectional layers is prepared using 3d p software and then submitted to a 3d printer 28 3d scanning enables replicating existing products and other approaches to speed up production with cad based model preparation in a nutshell 3d p is advantageous for ecologically friendly environments because of its low waste manufacturing technique and low chemical exposure strategy this study aims to provide a comprehensive and brief overview of 3d p and membrane printing technologies in water purification and nanofiltration applications 30 specifically an in depth overview of numerous 3d p procedures in membrane technology and filtration frameworks were explored it evaluates the possible application directions for manufacturing methods in conjunction with h2o purification technologies based on the literature it concludes with a list of limits and predictions for their prospective practicality and scalability as part of our research we look at some of the most critical aspects of technology that could help us figure out how to use 3d p technology for water treatment in the future 2 classification nowadays manufacturing utilizes various 3d p methods which may be grouped into liquid based powder based and solid based classifications liquid based 3d p technologies are the most common the methods of cutting and joining photo curing joining binding melting and solidifying may also be characterized even since they are defined according to the sort of printing medium they employ introduction of the stereolithography apparatus sla in 3d p 26 several unique techniques have been established included in fig 2 new innovations such as two or multiphoton polymerization also known as 2pp mpp which use photopolymer mediated nonlinear photon absorption have also been categorized 3d p can be divided into 7 kinds according to the american society for testing and materials astm as shown in table 1 30 2 1 scientific applications of 3d p devices for distillation in recent years an upsurge in research has been observed on the development of 3d p in various sectors from engineering technology to life science which has been advantageous environmental research and engineering are beginning to reap the benefits of 3d p 31 miniature devices for toxicity control and environmental evaluations and certain specialized components of water cleaning are being developed using the 3d p method among other applications 12 since research on membrane modules was conducted before using this technology for water cleaning methods the production of membranes is a relatively recent field of study consequently the present study investigates the potential for 3d p to be employed in the production of water treatment desalination membranes are manufactured as thin layers or cylindrical strands lengthy extremely thin rods depending on their intended purpose 12 modules can be manufactured by stacking these membranes and packing them into tubes the most prevalent membrane module designs for reverse osmosis ro systems are hollow fiber and spiral wound membranes swm 32 33 in the design of membrane modules hollow fiber membranes are the most often used kind of membrane sheet and frame modules rotary modules cylindrical modules oscillating modules and cubic vortex are some of the other kinds of modules 34 since its inception in reverse osmosis swm has gained significant acceptance in seawater desalination outpacing hollow fiber membrane modules in profitability and desirability 34 35 swm provides an optimal balance between operational fouling control efficiency and packing density needs the study would benefit from reviewing prior research that has been conducted on 3d p in the creation of module and membrane designs 2 2 3d p in membranes fabrication and spacer design the membranes in the swm module are isolated from one another by carriers which are referred to as spacers because of the way it is manufactured fig 3 to keep membranes apart and provide flow channels it has been recommended that feed spacers which have the appearance of net like structures be placed between membranes this will improve swm modules fluid mixing and overall efficiency by keeping them apart and providing flow channels 36 the stiffness of the membrane sheets must be chosen throughout the manufacturing process to sustain the membrane sheets without harming the membrane sheets furthermore since the feed spacers must be wrapped around the central permeate tube to be functional they cannot be too stiff to do their job correctly polypropylene pp is the most often used material in the manufacturing of spacers because of its elasticity and exceptional chemical resistivity pp spacers are used in various medical devices aerospace and automotive applications 37 several analyses had conducted to determine the influence of various feed spacer characteristics including morphological features on their effectiveness in water purification 38 when using traditional manufacturing processes like injection molding or thermal extrusion the intricacy of spacer designs has proved to be a stumbling barrier 39 previous efforts to create innovative membrane spacers with optimum performance depended heavily on computer simulations to accomplish their goals over the last several years several 3d p technologies have been employed to generate feed spacer components and other parts 40 aside from that the advent of 3d printing has made creating complex geometrical structures more efficient as a result scientists were inspired to employ 3d p to build new feed spacers that overcome manufacturing constraints table 2 summarizes the various types of 3d printed spacers used in water filtration 2 2 1 spacer fabrication via sls as far as we know li et al were the first to investigate the fabrication of membrane spacers using 3d printing which was the first of its type 14 years ago and they were the first to do so 41 furthermore they not only established novel spacers but also emphasized enhancing mass transfer inside the spacer filled channels throughout all stages of the spacers design and development using the selective laser sintering sls process the titanium spacers were cut with a laser before being assembled investigations were conducted to test 3 distinct spacers geometries generated all of which were examined using the limiting current technique in addition the mass transfer rate of the spacers was determined as the researchers discovered in their experiments the geometry of spacers influences their effectiveness in membrane separation procedures and multilayered spacers excelled both helically coiled tubes and modified fiber spacers when it came to performing membrane separation tan et al also fabricate and analyze spacers using the sls method besides thomas et al and sreedhar 42 43 tan et al optimized various process parameters including sheet width temperature and scan structure density utilizing the sls technique 42 additional measurements and analyses were performed on the spacer prototypes including fracture toughness elastic modulus and dimension accuracy pre treating printing materials and sophisticated printing techniques have been proposed in a number of studies to overcome the dimensional inaccuracies of sls technology to increase mechanical attributes tpms topologies according to thomas et al have been explored for their effect on feed spacers fabricated using the sls method 43 compared to commercial feed spacers they have increased the heat transfer coefficient when employed in membrane distillation significantly improving over conventional feed spacers this is due to the interpenetrating structures of the feed spacers which are responsible for this sreedhar and colleagues research on feed spacers for biofouling mitigation aimed to increase spacer efficacy for membrane filtration applications 44 biofouling deposition on 3d printed spacers and membrane was reduced compared to conventional feed spacers 45 2 2 2 spacer fabrication via fdm a new generation of spacer architectures including ladder like structures herringbones and helices were manufactured utilizing fused deposition modeling techniques 46 47 shrivastava et al were particularly interested in investigating the impact of different shaped spacers on concentration polarization and how they may use the knowledge to advance the efficiency of the reverse osmosis process 38 48 a study indicated that helical spacers were the most efficient in terms of enhancing mass transfer 47 they were followed by laddered spacers and finally herringbone spacers completed the pattern another study carried out by kerdi et al investigated the possibility of modifying the feed spacer made using a stereolithography device by perforation to reduce the membrane fouling effect and boost filter flow 49 50 before conducting an experiment computational fluid dynamics cfd is utilized to investigate the perforation effects on local hydrodynamics of the perforated spacers hole perforation was found to have the maximum permeate flow and the most considerable flux 75 at constant pressure consistent feed flow conditions resulted in the maximum permeate flux of 23 51 thus considerable innovative research has indicated the manufacturing of 3dp composite spacers via fdm such as tio2 with polylactichydroxyapatite polyetheretherketone or polycarbonate 20 recent studies have shown that am structures can be used to remediate wastewater polymer zeolite composite structures helped in reducing ammonia accumulation in water 52 hence employing am to create and analyze photoelectrocatalytic reactors for operation and customization can assist in developing architectures that suit site specific requirements the use of buoyant nanostructures to optimize photocatalysts in the photosensitive domain overcomes the limitations of loose granules or slurries that would otherwise gather and collapse lowering overall efficiency 3d p allows easy recovery of catalysts from complicated environmental media preventing harmful residual emissions and potential effects on the environment andrew d mcqueen and his colleagues investigated the photocatalytic ability of tio2 embedded into 3d printable polymer polylactic acid pla via fdm to purify sediment containing organic contamination e g polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah attained from a confined disposal facility cdf pahs have been chosen due to their potential aquatic toxicity in these sediments and photodegradation possibility fig 4 a the benefit of integrating photocatalyst into a 3dp pla is that one can ensure specific targeting of stabilized tio2 in the photosensitive domain restricting settlement and aggregation while avoiding contamination the 3d printed pla tio2 samples disintegrated compounds of pahs in polluted water the pla tio2 composite in a circular disc form as shown in fig 4 b i was printed with nearly 8 cm diameter and 1 mm width the sem images of the 3dp disc confirm the presence of tio2 aggregates observable at or near the surface fig 4 b ii the pah dark analysis shows no significant degradation or contamination decline within 6 h however uv exposure tio2 settled powder and 3d printed pla tio2 disc show significant degradation in pah concentrations after 1 to 6 h of treatment fig 4 c confirming that embedding the photocatalysis in polymer does not eliminate its efficacy achieving nondetectable pah concentrations within hours to days tio2 integrations with inorganic oxides improved photocatalytic degradation under visible light such as tio2 graphene composites ti zno cr2o3 cu n doped tio2 and ti zno composites 53 54 2 2 3 spacer fabrication via polyjet printing siddiqui et al used a membrane fouling simulator msf found that 3d p spacers improved hydrodynamics while reducing biofouling 55 56 as a starting point they compared the geometrical properties of a 3d polyjet printed spacer to those of a traditional spacer with the same geometrical parameters the accumulation of biomass the hydrodynamic behavior and the reduction in pressure were all comparable as a consequence of numerical comparison a redesigned spacer design was devised which resulted in a smaller pressure drop over time and a reduction in biomass accumulation in their research they observed that by utilizing numerical modeling and real testing of spacers built using 3d technology they could design improved spacers that might potentially boost membrane performance however polyjet fabrication of spacers is considered adequate due to the lower cost and higher resolution of the spacers generated by other 3d p procedures 57 fdm and sla printing were determined to be ineffective in printing spacers as fdm created brittle spacers having wider filaments than the original model while sla generated spacers with weaker fracture toughness and mechanical characteristics than the intended design 3 3d p membranes application 3 1 3d p membranes via sls in anti biofouling applications 3d p is currently cumbersome to synthesize thin layers researchers started by investigating how the technology may be used to membrane module components for anti biofouling as a result considerable improvements were concentrated on module studies 58 using sls printer and modeling researchers fabricate filament twisted plates and multi layer spacers having regular filaments using twisted tapes according to the findings of this research computation fluid mechanics cfm can be unreliable due to the complex configuration of the filaments 59 it is observed that twisted structures and modified filaments show less productivity while multi layer alignments have the potential to improve performance this contrasts with prior computational fluid dynamics investigations since those investigations a plethora of research has been conducted to develop novel design techniques for membrane feed spacers 38 40 inspite of the fact that some research has been dependent on alterations of commercially available designs i e deviating the angle configurations i e triply periodic minimal surface spacers tpms as shown in fig 5 a the enhanced interaction of film with the fluid and the water mixing resulted in a considerable improvement in process performance additionally total organic carbon toc biofouling is significantly decreased due to using this novel form of a spacer 60 while the gyroid sk type tmps spacer significantly reduced toc on membranes surface by 91 schwarz p sk and clp sh spacers significantly reduced toc on membranes surface by 65 and 46 respectively fig 5 a 61 the spacers exhibited no mechanical deformation during the operation suggesting their commercial use a pressure drop also decreases as a result of the use of tpms spacers the best performance was achieved by the schwarz p sk which had 12 5 less pressure drop than the commercial spacer a transverse clp spacer was developed by the same research group and used in the membrane distillation md process compared to commercially available net type spacers the transverse clp spacer increased flow by 60 a significant step forward in membrane science has been made possible by developing honeycomb shaped membrane supports using 3d p it has been mainly designed for use with fo membranes so this spacer is the first of its kind fig 5 b in manufacturing electrodialysis ed membranes another 3d printed spacer was used as a support structure using 3d p technologies bai et al created five different spacers to increase the stack voltage limiting current density lcd and pressure drop of ed equipment porous spacers were designed using an fdm and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs filament with minor weave pattern faults 64 the fifth spacer with modified cubic parts had the greatest lcd which was 2 0 3 5 times larger than the lcd of the non spacer particularly spacer 2 has non usable performance when the pressure drops by 5 kpa some studies have focused not only on the geometry of the spacers but also on the substance of the spacers and the influence of the 3d p procedure on the spacers yanar and choi et al investigated the impact of abs polypropylene pp and polylactic acid pla 62 63 they discovered that the printing materials had comparable fouling water flux and mechanical strength to the spacer fig 5 c d 63 autodesk meshmixer and blender were used to create the 3d spacer model for this project 3d p is also an excellent tool for introducing new technologies that are merging vibrating spacers for example are an example of this tan et al and wu et al synthesize vibrating spacers using 3d p 37 42 65 fault mitigation for flat type membranes was improved due to the higher shear rate and turbulence generated by the new type of spacer design research on 3d p spacers is at an early stage it is necessary to evaluate the suitability of 3d p spacers for use in desalination and water purification 2 12 furthermore spiral wound modules are used to construct most membrane modules due to their superior efficiency armbruster et al examined tubular membranes to minimize the fouling on ceramic membranes 66 using a polyjet 3d p a photosensitive acrylate based polymer as a printing medium and a second polymer as support material were manufactured by polymers fabricating the static mixers 66 67 the group developed aerating static mixers to decrease tubular membrane filtration fouling incorporating air sparging and static mixing the group subsequently improved this technology a crucial difficulty for hollow fiber membranes is the buildup of a preserved component on the film s surface which may result in a considerable reduction in mass transfer efficiency it is necessary to formulate the most effective design for momentum adsorption during the extrusion process as a result spinneret design and manufacture are crucial elements to address this issue luelf et al used 3d p to construct a variety of spinnerets with varying shapes 68 al shimmery created composite membranes with enhanced antifouling properties by depositing a thin selective layer on 3d wavy structured supports 69 3 2 3d p membranes via fdm dlp in oil water separation applications another novel use of membrane system technology is the 3d p of microfluidic crossflow filtration systems developed by wardrip et al to show fouling research viability the microfluidic technology operates more effectively and may result in cheaper pricing for foulants and chemicals 70 3d p of a two membrane single pass module was also employed to fabricate another filtering system as of right now the majority of module studies are still relying on simulations researchers may use 3d p to confirm further their data for already completed research projects which is a tremendous opportunity despite the fact the construction of the entire membrane by 3d p has been limited in the past there have recently been several significant investigations that began with an oil water separation membrane as described by lv et al in their pioneering work and progressed from there to other applications they developed superhydrophobic porous membranes for oil water separation and nano silica filled polydimethylsiloxane pdms ink which they used in conjunction with pdms ink 71 consequently 3d p was used to create a superhydrophobic surface on a permeable structure which prevented weak interface adhesion compared to more conventional fabrication techniques according to the researchers the highest oil water separation efficacy 99 6 is achieved with pore diameters of 0 37 mm following this investigation yuan et al conducted a study on oil water separation published in the same journal 72 a superhydrophobic polysulfone psu membrane support was created utilizing 3d p technology known as selective laser sintering to create the final 3d printed membrane performance tests were carried out on the membrane after being coated with candle soot and allowed to dry apart from water the film exhibited superhydrophobicity 161o and excellent biocompatibility additionally it demonstrated a high removal efficiency of 95 for the whole hexane water extraction even after ten operation cycles along with 3d printed polyamide membranes with superhydrophobic and superoleophilic surfaces yuan et al developed superhydrophobic and underwater superoleophilic surfaces by roughening porous and micro nanostructural zeolitic imidazolate frameworks 72 73 when paired with an oil flow 24 000 lmh this approach produced 99 oil rejection three dimensional 3d printing has also been employed to develop curvilinear structures for oil water separation membranes 74 saeed m and his colleagues enhanced the cleanability permeability and fouling build up characteristics of the 3d p composite layers 75 it was shown that permeance recovery was 52 greater and oil rejection rates were 96 higher the permeability of pure water and the recovery of permeance increased by 87 and 53 respectively li et al have offered different techniques including a 3d printed oleophilic and superhydrophobic self floating membrane 76 these oil water separation investigations are complemented by some promising research on other kinds of water treatment membranes such as ion exchange and electrochemical chromatography recent research has focused on utilizing 3d p support for nanofiber casings poly methyl methacrylate graft poly dimethylsiloxane pmma g pdms copolymer and polyamide 6 were used to produce electrospun nanofiber membranes which were then printed in three dimensions 77 additionally 3d p technology may recreate structures inspired by nature which yang et al used to develop an efficient oil water separation solution 78 it was recently discovered that this kind of biomimetic technique might be used for membrane production in the work of xing et al using an fdm printer and was intended for use in oil water separation 79 80 with a pore size of 250 mm it was possible to achieve a separation efficiency of 99 4 79 while other researchers have used this method to print polymeric membranes for water purification hwa et al used it to construct ceramic membranes for water purification clay powders with particle sizes of 75 150 and 250 mm were utilized to produce 3d printed membranes with particle sizes ranging from 75 to 250 mm this was due to the small particles ability to capture larger sized contaminants using 3d p ray and colleagues developed another unique way to produce ceramic membranes the team used the solvent based slurry stereolithography 3s approach the 3s technique varies from conventional 3d p technologies in that it uses an indirect manufacturing strategy rather than direct production the 3s procedure varies from conventional 3d p processes in that it takes an indirect manufacturing approach in which the sintering process accomplishes densification after the green pieces have been 3d printed using alumina material based membranes the researchers could create membranes for ultrafiltration yaoyao ye and his colleagues manufactured double layer ceramic membranes comprising separation and support layers for oil water separation 81 the separation stratum possesses microsized patterns having wavy half cylindrical and triangular morphology the support layer comprises homogenous pores throughout the layer a highly precise design can be generated by regulating the dye percentage of the solution and the optical power density of the printer an oil in water mixture containing 100 mg l oil is processed using a half cylindrical membrane to attain 82 oil rejection 81 layer by layer curing takes place via lowering the platform in a slurry using sunk dlp printer as shown in fig 6 a the membrane fabrication procedure and 3dp filtration structure having wavy cylindrical and triangle patterns are shown in fig 6 b possessing 50 mm diameter of separation and porous layers having 40 μm and 1 54 mm thickness with a total surface area of 1951 mm2 2294 mm2 2370 mm2 additional slurries from 3dp membranes were removed via ultrasonication in water and ethanol fig 6 c i displays sem images to evaluate 3dp layer morphology displaying surface patterns and the support layer s surface pores 150 μm average pore size the pore configuration including size surface area and volume are significant parameters in the filtration mechanism of membranes a half cylindrical 3dp membrane demonstrates a water flux of 145 l m2 h bar having a pore range of 183 nm to 119 μm distributed fig 6 d i shows that the permeate flux as a function of time which shows the permeate flux across the ceramic membrane decreases from 97 to 53 l m2 h bar after an hour reaching a stable flux of 53 l m2 h bar exhibiting oil rejection coefficient r up to 82 performing better treatment for water purification similarly zhipeng jin and his colleagues synthesize a ceramic membrane with a gradient pore structure possessing superhydrophobic superoleophilic properties using 3dp the gradient pore structure manages a flow rate of up to 25 434 l m2h approximately 40 higher than a straight pore structure at 200 c performance was maintained at 97 4 82 table 3 described 3d printed flexible nanofibrous membranes utilized for oil water mixture separation via different techniques exhibiting 95 efficiency although there has been some development in 3d p research there has been minimal progress toward developing devices that can manufacture elastomeric or porcelain membranes nowadays presented printing constituents are regarded to be the focus of most membrane research which are not particularly successful when utilized for filtering purposes when applied to membranes likewise the expansion of printers capable of adjusting the quantity of blended nanoparticles serves an important demand particularly for polymeric membranes as previously stated the development of 3d p expertise to accomplish flawless production of the entire sheath is still in its early stages researchers are looking at printing techniques on membrane surfaces and 3d p of gel or solvent on the layers surface more plausible studies based on current technology due to a risk of failure in the absence of scientific incorporation amid research and 3d p technology 3 3 3d p membranes in photocatalytic and desalination applications environmental protection awareness has resulted in several high efficacy catalytic materials with precise structural characteristics particularly in the study disciplines of photocatalytic degradation electrocatalysis and other related domains increased attention has recently been drawn to the strong relationship between catalyst shape and photocatalytic activity 3d printing monolithic catalysts can effectively handle the confined surface area complex production techniques and severe pore destabilization induced by rapid temperature variations catalysts were split into multiple portions of the catalyst structure to perform complex reactions using the highly tailored distribution of catalytic materials by 3d printing utilization of this technique in the manufacture of microreactors is also conceivable the catalyst component is housed in the printed catalytic structure which also controls the flow of reactants sla among the most popular methods of the 3d p process is particularly well suited for solidifying resin for dye degradation patterned resins may be solidified by varying the length and intensity of irradiation and attaching to a platform or surface consequently the desired structure was created in layers rather than in one piece the need for wide ranging industrial use and concern for environmentally friendly synthesis specify a significant obstacle to the development of a novel catalyst system recently flake reinforcement specimens with three different periodic holes have been generated using sla and sintered in n2 to form carbon ceramic reinforcement to strengthen the resin al2o3 and sio2 particles were included in the polymeric solution and air conditioned ceramic support was also made as a comparison pore size distribution and the micromorphology of the material are greatly influenced by the presence of pyrolyzed carbon resulting in a highly complex microstructure with huge pores a molybdenum disulfide mos2 layer is applied to the surface of the sintered carbon ceramic support or on the ceramic support array patterns and pyrolyzed carbon from n2 protection were studied to see how they affected the photodegradation effectiveness of mos2 several points were raised about the catalyst support system s stability and effectiveness in absorbing light sla has three different geometric array patterns seen in fig 7 the structure of each is shown 99 some light particles spread by the scattered light spots adhered to the wall distorting its boundaries when printing adhesion between adjacent layers may be seen on the support because of the added inorganic nanoparticles in the slurry the laser lost its ability to produce patterns with a circular arc and a sharp angle during printing this new bioinspired carbon support can be made more precisely and faster than previous biomorphic carbon support work it has a considerable advantage over conventional production approaches in terms of customization carbon reinforcements from the photo curable epoxy were made by sintering at 1400 c in n2 while ceramic supports were produced by sintering in air the photocurable resin was protected from degradation by the n2 environment and the amount of pyrolyzed carbon was determined to be 12 86 2 32 wt fig 7 depicts the microstructure of the carbon support which shows how intricate and densely packed it was the micropores decreased to a diameter of 5 μm and had a remarkable uniformity of size distribution across the specimen the protrusions and chip like structure were firmly packed on the support s surface sintering is prevented by pyrolyzed carbon which prevents the mass transfer of ceramic powder resulting in the development of this shape and structure a considerable pressure gradient was not created to break through the surface additionally graphitization enhances the conductivity of pyrolyzed carbon making it simpler to separate photogenerated electron hole pairs as previously explained the laser s circular arc and acute angle features were lost because the laser was scattered by the matrix composites in the slurry the sintering procedure induced significant shrinkage of the material during the thermal treatment square matrix patterning revealed an ideal adsorption performance of 41 37 while the other two arrays exceeded 35 under similar thermal conditions the catalytic efficiency of the catalyst was influenced by the geometrical array design and the carbon concentration of the sintering environment this demonstrated that ceramic support exhibited no deteriorating qualities and adsorption had reached a saturation level of 3 91 after 60 min of incubation photodegradation efficiency of ceramic support with square array increased to 45 95 from 23 35 in contrast the photodegradation efficiency of ceramic support with circular array and diamond array increased to 36 30 and 28 95 which was significantly lower than ceramic support with a square collection although carbon supports experienced a significant improvement in photodegradation efficiency ceramic supports only observed a 5 78 photodegradation efficiency when used in the same geometric array arrangement as a result all three array designs significantly boosted their overall efficiency when their mos2 content was fixed the dispersion of the agglomerated catalyst which required the application of light from a single direction was a significant contributing component the pore was made more complicated by adding pyrolyzed carbon which gave the catalyst a higher chance of attaching itself to it in contrast partially pyrolyzing carbon resulted in partial graphitization resulting in graphite formation with good conductivity besides extraordinarily high photodegradation efficiency catalyst materials utilized in industrial production must also exhibit exceptional stability mos2 photodegradation efficiency declined considerably after two cycles reaching around 87 65 after three cycles and stabilizing at roughly 82 55 after five cycles following carbon support loading this study shows an overall trend toward improved photocatalytic activity on rhb dye degradation after three cycles due to loss of catalyst mass that occurs during the stirring process the photodegradation performance after cycles may be diminished hence 3d printing technology can produce complex and precise structures that can be adjusted and carefully controlled without needing the expensive manufacturing process required by prior approaches resulting in comparatively affordable prices 3d printing on the other hand has significant downsides such as mechanical density and weak impact resistance implying that the catalysts would be unable to endure external pressures while still retaining photocatalytic efficiency aside from melting or sintering or bonding during the printing process causing the breakdown of the functional structure catalysts may also be destroyed furthermore immobilization of the catalyst has the added benefit of improving reaction performance and increasing catalyst recovery the enhanced chemical thermal and mechanical durability of catalyst materials has resulted in a greater catalytic efficiency from support it can be widely used in industrial production only after the catalyst is linked to the support currently the powder condition of the catalyst causes insufficient performance owing to aggregation which is a key constraint of catalyst used as the catalyst s performance and structure are intertwined its recyclability and stability fall short of actual manufacturing requirements for this reason 3d p holds the promising capability to fabricate precise functional structures for catalysts because it can be used to deposit the catalyst onto porous support with a wide surface area 3 4 floating 3d p catalyst for organic contaminants degradation nowadays our society is more concerned about environmental contamination particularly water pollution pharmaceutical products are classified as contaminants of emergent concern cec because they have a refractory character and are difficult to remove from a system or environment it is necessary to develop new treatment procedures to degrade specific organic contaminants it is commonly recognized that heterogeneous photocatalysis with supported tio2 is a reliable method that has been extensively proven this context lends itself to the use of tio2 photocatalysis for cecs extraction from wastewater the presence of a floating catalyst having a lower density than water has the additional benefit of making tio2 reachable to uv rays primarily if that radiation is emitted by the sun and often contaminants may be seen floating on the water surface i e oil pollutants to attain high surface area bifunctional material from waste cork certain members have expertise in making floating adsorbents photocatalysts which have both adsorbents and photocatalytic capabilities in the course of wastewater treatment cork might come loose reducing the system s effectiveness overall low density polyethylene ldpe may be a suitable substrate for floating photocatalysts because it has a lesser density than water and is very stable and resistant to degeneration these floating catalysts glass or polymeric have been explored to eliminate various contaminants tio2 is included in commercial substrates of globular shape or configuration having a low surface to volume ratios which is a noteworthy drawback for surface procedures the use of commercial or lab prepared substrates restricts a number of configurations that may be used 3d p permits creating highly varied geometries that cannot be attained via traditional processing plastics molding injection etc seeking high surface volume ratios this constraint may be overcome according to stefanov et al some studies have been done to remove organic impurities via 3d p photocatalysts 100 hernández afonso et al and skorski et al used ceramics and acrylonitrile butadiene synthetic supports for wastewater purification 101 102 however since these supports aren t floating it s possible that the process efficiency might be enhanced by creating 3d printed floating catalysts that make use of the benefits of floating supports in light of this this investigation determines to explore photo catalytic removal of ofloxacin c18h20fn3o4 an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections from wastewater as a model for cecs zhang et al studied the anatase phase to improve the catalytic activity 103 tio2 is dispersed in ldpe as an extruding agent by mixing the two materials in a cylindrical mixer or employing o xylene or a commercial anionic surfactant to disperse the tio2 particles before extrusion in addition 3d printing of ldpe tio2 meshes increased the surface area of the catalyst compared to a standard ldpe tio2 plate methylene blue was first used to test operating conditions and assess the technology s efficiency the elimination of ofloxacin was then carried out based on the results of this earlier assessment as shown in fig 8 several catalysts may be prepared preparation of the ldpe tio2 plate was done utilizing a cylinder mixer cm guix cylinder temperature of 160 c 104 this plate served as a benchmark for the activity the materials supplied to the extruder were produced by mixing granulated ldpe with tio2 in the presence of o xylene or an anionic surfactant ldpe tio2 o xylene and ldpe tio2 surfactant 3d printing was used to shape the ejected filaments square mesh with a surface volume ratio of 1 mm 0 1 mm was chosen as an adequate morphology for the project the extruder was a filafab pro 350 ex extrusion 235 c nozzle 194 c nozzle diameter 1 75 mm a bed temperature of 45 c an extruder temperature 200 c and a printing speed of 1000 mm were employed in the 3d printing process thus floating photocatalysis allows improved access to uv radiation ofloxacin a model of cec was successfully removed from synthetic wastewater increasing the photocatalyst s active surface increases catalytic activity ldpe tio2 meshes were made using various methods including mixing the two materials or dispersing them with o xylene or anionic surfactant 105 filaments were extruded and utilized to produce meshes during 3d printing errors of 10 were found in the procedure and catalyst activity remained the same after being recycled three times for the first time researchers have found a way to cure pollutants like cecs in situ using photocatalysts and sunlight a promising approach because of its cheap cost and facile implantation 3 5 3d printed residential solar water disinfection applications according to a un study issued in 2015 663 million individuals worldwide lack access to clean water 106 many tenants cannot afford to pay for municipally cleaned water even in regions where it is easily accessible according to the gates foundation around 700 000 children die from diarrhea each year water treatment options for the home that are inexpensive ecologically benign easy to set up and simple to use are in critical need of development sodis solar disinfection of drinking water is a water treatment system that involves exposing a transparent water container such as a plastic bottle to direct sunlight for an extended period this leads to the deactivation of microbes chiefly caused by dna damage produced by ultraviolet uv radiation and contact with reactive oxygen species ros uv light and ros interaction are the most common causes of dna damage in terms of water treatment sodis is a low cost and uncomplicated technology still it requires a significant amount of time with disinfection periods of up to 48 h necessary for some instances 106 the rate of water disinfection may be significantly amplified by developing photocatalysts to produce more reactive oxygen species ros which can then be used to disinfect the water 107 an electron hole pair is formed when a photon impacts a catalyst with an energy larger than or equal to the catalyst bandgap this enables catalysts to react with water and dissolved oxygen to generate ros that is harmful to microbes such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals it has been shown that the ros approach can produce a high rate of water disinfection when using tio2 zno and mos2 as active ingredients 107 108 it is essential to develop a reliable catalyst immobilization technique for these materials before being employed in practical applications which is one of the most significant obstacles to widespread usage it is essential to establish long term immobilization of catalyst material to reduce the amount of catalyst that leaks into drinking water as previously discussed a complicated filtering operation is required to extract nano sized catalyst particles from treated water making the whole process costly and inefficient the use of tio2 thoroughly investigated non toxic catalysts available may assist in mitigating the risks associated with release into the environment tio2 when doped with carbon sulfur nitrogen or hydrogen is capable of collecting light in the ultraviolet and visible bands and it may be utilized to limit the likelihood of environmental release given the unknown health consequences and bad taste of titania particles in drinking water these particles must be eliminated it is necessary to process sodis for up to 48 h since it is based on microbial inactivation induced by solar radiation in the ultraviolet uv spectrum photocatalytic materials like titanium dioxide which captures sunlight and accelerates the creation of reactive oxygen species ros that inactivate bacteria within a few hours may dramatically boost the pace of water treatment in most water treatment systems one major obstacle to the incorporation of photocatalysts is the need for the catalyst particles to be embedded in a 3d configuration having a large surface area that is stable underneath the water current researchers developed the am technique for titanium and proposed an effectual solar water disinfection method centered on architected tio2 that does not need costly catalyst filtration the titanium monomers are produced by ligand interchange reaction among titanium alkoxide and acrylic acid to generate a pre ceramic titanium photoresist that may be printed on ceramic surfaces a commercial stereolithography system is then used to create sophisticated 3d constructions subsequently pyrolyzed to eliminate any remaining organic material from the structures energy dispersive spectroscopy measurements near the structure s surface reveal that it has a chemical composition of 46 ti 31 o and 23 c which is around 40 less in size than the structure as it was originally manufactured eds the 3d structures having sporadic cubic and octet configurations were constructed using this technology with unit cells ranging in size 0 65 to 1 14 mm beam lengths ranging from 115 to 170 mm and relative densities ranging from 11 to 31 the microstructure of these lattices as shown by transmission electron microscopy tem is nanocrystalline titania rutile with a mean grain size of 60 nm this is consistent with the findings of previous research this cubic titania micro lattice has a density of 350 365 kg m3 and mechanical studies indicate compressive strengths of up to 4 3 mpa which is many times higher than the compressive values recorded for titania foams of similar density finally the established am method can be fine tuned to minimize carbon content while still producing components with a titanium content of 99 9 by weight thus it exhibits that proposed titania is used to fabricate effective and economical photocatalytic reactors in domestic water disinfection besides in photocatalytic h2 production co2 conversion and tissue engineering among other things the immobilization of tio2 under the effect of water flow is a significant technical problem as supports for titania various solid substrates have been investigated including carbon particles silica particles glass fibers or sand the introduction of a secondary material decreases available catalytic surface area it restricts reactant s mass transfer resulting in a considerable decline in the overall efficiency of the process using heat treatment of sol gel derived tio2 in the coating of a template material which is readily disrupted during the coating process raises the danger of contamination self supported titania foams have had limited success because of the risk of the foam breaking and leaking material into the water using additive manufacturing am this study proposes a technique for creating sturdy self sustaining 3d photocatalytic tio2 structures to build practical reactors for residential solar water disinfection applications hand agitation was used to mix acrylic acid 17 3 g and titanium iv ethoxide 13 7 g in a glove box fig 9 a i a yellow to orange shift in the fluid s coloration indicated a ligand exchange process in progress after that the mixture was placed in a vacuum chamber for 15 min to remove any leftover ethanol residue on an autodesk ember 3d printer utilizing stereolithography to build up a titanium rich photoresist in layers of 25 μm fig 9 a ii several diverse geometries of structures were printed each with a different amount of uv exposure time 14 s for the initial layer nine seconds for the next four layers and then three seconds for the last layer following a 15 minute soak in pgmea the printed structures were washed in ipa for 10 min fig 9 b depicts the finished product of a titanium containing polymer scaffold in the last phase of this am process a tube furnace was used to pyrolyze the printed titanium containing polymer structures the temperature was raised to 1000 c at 2 c min and kept there for an hour fig 9 b ii iii illustrates typical pyrolyzed titania structures fig 7b i shows a 10 10 10 cubic lattice with unit cell dimensions these samples relative density ranged from 11 to 31 density all samples showed linear shrinkage and mass loss after being pyrolyzed in an ar 1000 c as shown in fig 9 b iii the cubic titania lattices produced had unit cell sizes between 0 66 mm and 0 01 mm and beam widths between 170 mm and 5 mm an sem image of the morphology of the pyrolysis treated octets is shown in fig 9 c at various magnifications sl printer inherent layer to layer transition patterns can be seen in fig 9 which exhibit cells and beams of uniform size with crystals ranging from 20 to 150 nm the structure s surface is coated with porous nanocrystalline 105 a titanium rich photoresist was made and a polymer derived titania am method was shown using octet and cubic morphologies a 60 nm grain titanium dioxide microstructure was found in these lattices according to findings depending on the pyrolysis conditions the titanium concentration in the resultant structure varied from 77 to 99 according to a new study 3d p titania lattices were often stronger than equivalent titania foams of the same density architected photocatalytic devices have large surface areas and sturdy self supporting morphology having the ability to offer effective solar water disinfection without the need for costly catalyst filtration water treatment utilizing architected titania will be tested using organic pollutants and microorganisms in the future other applications include photocatalytic water splitting for h2 production scaffolds for tissue engineering fuel generation from co2 solar cells and photocatalytic water splitting desalination and long term viability depend on developing novel water treatment materials 109 although certain 3d printing techniques may provide fewer obstacles they have shown to be inappropriate for keeping up with the latest conventional membrane manufacturing technology at least for the time being the expense of 3d printed membranes equipment constraints the requirement for operational and technical skills scalability and commercial potential are some primary downsides of this technology there are two types of costs associated with 3d produced membranes the cost of a 3d printer and the printing materials used to create them although 3d printers are becoming more affordable the high cost of these devices has prevented their complete integration into membrane desalination systems polymer printing has also been used to print membranes throughout the course of history 110 3 6 3d p nanomembranes via inkjet printing for degradation and desalination applications the presentation of inkjet printing develops new techniques for synthesizing selective layers of water cleaning using inkjet printing technology 111 despite being extensively utilized in industry it has also been modified for use in scientific research consequently there has been a significant rise in research into biopolymer arrays organic transistors ceramics and light emitting diodes 112 inkjet printing may differ between continuous inkjet cij and drop on demand dod inkjet printing continuous inkjet printing is feasible because it generates a continuous liquid droplets stream and recycles unwanted ink via deflecting an electric field despite the fact that it is a sustainable procedure the recycling step is associated with the danger of contamination as a result of exposure to air in contrast to the cij kind the dod type does not form droplets continuously therefore there is no risk of impurity from ink cartridges inkjet printing was initially used to generate 3d p polymers and nanomaterials uf membranes in particular have been the subject of much investigation 112 113 they created checkerboard patterns in black and white and applied an inkjet printing to fluorine containing diamine monomer to a uh membrane presoaked in mpd aqueous solution consequently it was achieved that improved proficiency for the membrane is achieved marking the first attempt to create tfc membranes having physical characteristics using printing aided fabrication researchers achieved improved salt removal by using a patterned fluorinated diamine to be included in an m phenylenediamine based polyamide the research results revealed that printing technology might be used in interfacial polymerization gao et al advanced the approach by synthesizing polymeric nanomaterials such as polymeric nanotubes nanowires and thin films which they used to enhance the technology further 114 a sacrificial pattern i e polycarbonate track etched stratum must first be created and used after that the substance was applied to the template s surface using a brush nanotubes or nanowires were formed within the pores of the polycarbonate track etched membrane pcte stratum due to the presence of either polymer carbon powder metallic nanoparticles or semiconducting materials within the stratum pore toward the creation of the final shape of the membranes consequently the inkjet printed nanofiltration membranes achieved satisfactory performance in salt rejection and water flow compared to conventional membranes 115 due to having almost equal and charge domains a neutral charge was created in a mosaic membrane which boosted its permeability properties it was observed that functionalized membranes and dissolved ions had a significant impact the potassium chloride kcl enrichment was analyzed for feed solution concentrations of 1 mm and 10 mm to evaluate charge mosaic membranes ionic strength and performance a rejection rate of 17 5 1 mm feed solution and 2 0 1 6 10 mm feed solution was observed respectively indicating that the mosaic membrane could enrich the salt concentration even for these more concentrated feed solutions 115 lee and heo et al printed using inkjet on electrospun polyurethane fibrous membranes to distinguish themselves from other researchers while other researchers used silver nanoparticles bacterial resistance was shown during water purification using membranes coated with silver nanoparticles 116 bernstein and colleagues recently used inkjet printing and graft polymerization to modify thin polymeric layers the tailored layers demonstrated reduced protein fouling qualities as well as decreased biofilm formation 117 to generate ultrathin go membranes fathizadeh and colleagues employed inkjet printing 118 the fabrication of ultrathin 7 560 nm nanofiltration membranes was made possible by following these straightforward processes the 30 nm two times printed surface exhibited the highest methyl orange degradation 95 9 in comparison 15 nm single printed coating had a water permeance that was twice that of the 30 nm coating and an acceptable elimination of 83 9 a 30 nm coated double printed illustration having superior effectiveness elimination showed 76 4 80 1 83 0 and 95 2 rejection rates respectively for gemfibrozil 17α ethynylestradiol diclofenac sodium salt and iodixanol 118 this research lays the groundwork for forthcoming applications of inkjet printing to fabricate efficient water treatment membranes for drinking water treatment applications cnts in particular are renowned due to their excellent implementation as water treatment films they have previously remained effectively used in inkjet printing for cnt coating in a variety of applications including electrical devices in addition to biomimetic applications inkjet printing has a significant role surface alterations achieved by inkjet printing can convert even hydrophilic surfaces into hydrophobic structures in spite of the fact that it has not yet been used in membrane production the work conducted by zhang and colleagues offers an effective method for surface reformation they developed a mussel inspired ink that included optimum dopamine to produce superhydrophobic sheets motivated by the fog collecting skills of stenocara beetles 119 using in situ polymerization superhydrophilic surfaces are turned into superhydrophobic planes and this was accomplished by forming polydopamine in the presence of water the micropatterned surface which had an arrangement extent of around 500 mm and a separation distance of approximately 1000 mm had a water collection capability of 61 8 mg cm2 h 1 from the fog which was four times more than the unmodified surface 119 this approach can be extended to inkjet printing to generate biomimetic superhydrophobic films for water purification in contrast to inkjet printing 3d p using gel or solvent inks started to use in various applications these printing forms produce a repeatable configuration on the membrane s surface that can be controlled to make g c3n4 cn sodium alginate sa ink a combination of cn nanosheets or au dispersion solution was concentrated and then mixed with a sa solution 120 a tabletop 3d printer was used to print the aerogel after it had been prepared and the designs had been programmed in advance aerogels made of au cn sa cn sa 2 1 showed increased degradation with 93 efficiency it was also discovered that increasing the cn sa percentage improved photodegradation and adsorption efficacy also innovative is electro spraying to print nanomaterials on membrane surfaces a technique that has not been used before nanofiltration films with remarkable selectivity were created by coating microfiltration membranes with go according to chen et al according to their findings organic dye rejection rates of 98 8 98 97 and 100 for methylene blue methyl orange and evans blue were acquired at the same time it also eliminated na2so4 nacl mgso4 and mgcl2 63 13 27 86 41 82 and 15 00 120 table 4 represents 3d printed flexible nanofibrous membranes employed for various organic contamination degradation in waste water via different techniques 3 7 molecularly imprinted membranes for anti fouling applications surface printing methods are very important in membrane research because layers anti fouling and selectivity characteristics were largely influenced via the thin stratums on which they are printed 137 furthermore sophisticated printing capable of producing surfaces or supports without human intervention should be regarded as a methodology to be developed further among the most application areas for surface embossing is identifying and eliminating target molecules in mixtures using photoresponsive magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer chen et al discovered sulfonamides a kind of antibiotic employed to suppress microbial contamination 138 the synthetic polymer was employed for solid phase extraction of sulfomides from water suggesting that it might be used to remove and enrich such medications in real world samples in the near future bianchi and colleagues created a molecular imprinting polymer that might be used to detect estrogen in water which is becoming an increasingly prevalent pollutant in the environment 139 the researchers advanced a strategy for recognizing and preconcentrating estrogen in water by deploying a synthetic polymer as a solid phase extraction medium and they published their results in the journal water research in 2012 this unique method according to their results produced excellent resolution moreover meng et al proved salicylic acid might be recovered from an aqueous solution using a wollastonite based imprinted polymer that was made using a surface imprinting approach and used as an adsorbent this study shows that the manufactured adsorbent demonstrated high selectivity and that salicylic acid recovery was possible 140 researchers yang et al also stated that they had developed a dibenzothiophene imprinted polymer that could be used to remove dibenzothiophene from the environment 141 it is also possible to manufacture ion imprinting polymers using surface imprinting techniques which are used to remove heavy metals from various surfaces using a thin coating of thiourea chitosan on the magnetite fan and colleagues documented the synthesis of magnetite that was utilized to extract ag ions from an aqueous solution 142 compared to non imprinted thiourea chitosan beads the performance of ag i imprinted magnetic thiourea chitosan beads ag tcm was better ag tcm may also be used a total of five times which was also conceivable after treatment with cd ii ion imprinted polymer iip in accordance with li et al an aqueous solution was collected for further analysis 143 to eliminate the cd ii ion from the aqueous solution iip was created in their research they observed that after being printed the cd ii ion imprinted polymer had exceptional reusability and stability adsorption of the cd ii ion resulted in the elimination of this ion quite quickly although the adsorption capacity of the material was tested six times there was no obvious decline 143 in their research milja et al publicized that they have produced surface imprinted nanospheres for the purposes of solid phase uranium extraction 144 they were able to create a chemical that was water soluble and effective in the ph range of 5 7 it also displayed a high retention capacity of 97 1 μmol g when exposed to uranium concentrations of 10 mg l chang et al showed zr iv removal from aqueous solution utilizing aqueous solution removal employing a surface imprinted amino functionalized silica gel 145 they showed that sorbent imprinted with ions had the greatest static adsorption capacity with a maximum capacity of 11 mg g the researchers successfully identified the presence of trace zirconium in wastewater and specific alloys by using the newly developed technique surface imprinting is also used to produce mims molecularly imprinted membranes used in separation and other applications the separation of six fluoroquinolones fqs using a unique surface imprinted membrane created by wang et al 2016 146 a significant surface area for separation and high selectivity for recognizing fqs were seen in the fe3o4 ccns mips when they were first made which was confirmed in the experiments the separation procedure was made more straightforward to accomplish by using an external magnetic field to assist according to them this method might be used to remove fluoroquinolones from drinking h2o supplies liu et al showed hydrophilic macroporous cellulose membrane to adsorb protein lysozyme using surface imprinting technology 147 the membrane developed not only displayed strong selective adsorption against the structurally identical protein cytochrome c but also demonstrated a very high specific surface area applying this method to extract a target protein from a complex mixture has been shown and the possibility of using it in the future is being investigated the use of imprinted polymers as water treatment materials is becoming more popular because of their predefined selectivity which allows them to remove particular constituents from wastewater while also producing water with a high degree of purity mips were being investigated as natural receptor substitutes because of ease of manufacture 67 processes used to make mip include the development of a mip complex which may be achieved by densification or curing the polymer network and the elimination of the framework from the polymeric matrix after removing the template from the system it is feasible to build nanocavities of varied sizes shapes and functional group configurations the geometry of the microcavities allows them to differentiate the appropriate template molecule from a mixture passing over an imprinted surface 148 molecular imprinting uses a template molecule monomer cross linker porogenic solvent and numerous initiators relying on the polymerization being employed to create cross linked polymer and a variety of precursors depending on the type of polymers being used since one can identify certain template molecules they may be employed in water purification to eradicate and identify a broad variety of targeted contaminants creating a 3d imprint system is also achievable because of the development of binding sites across bulk materials which is beneficial in many ways on the other hand mip is better at making binding sites for tiny template molecules than the classic bulk imprinting technique for making binding sites for bigger template molecules this is owing to the challenges of employing bigger template molecules like feasible mass transport and the template being permanently entrapped within the polymer matrix surface imprinting is a technique that creates a binding spot which may be utilized to tackle these problems easily 4 perspectives during the last several years 3d p has advanced significantly resulting in a broader range of printing materials as well as more structural complexity and accuracy in printed items other applications for 3d printing technology include the production of electrode materials biopolymers microfluidic devices and the production of traditional structural materials on the other hand nanoscale research has shown considerable potential for 3d printed water treatment membranes and filters since extensive research had been conducted at macro and micro scales the strategy of modules might be considered initially the majority of module studies have concentrated only on the manufacture of spacers 3d p would provide a realistic and adaptable answer than the study done via computer modeling furthermore the module components and pressure vessels must be constructed from environmentally friendly and biocompatible materials research into the 3d p of cellulosic materials leads to developing novel ways for producing membrane modules from low cost and environmentally friendly materials technologies like electrospraying inkjet printing and solvent gel printing on membranes surfaces might be used to substitute previous outdated and inefficient manufacturing techniques aside from that other surface applications should also be considered i e melt electrospinning writing mew 31 a revolutionary additive manufacturing approach mew employs a computer aided deposition process to design and construct micrometer thin fiber layers in a 3d printed structure oil water separation and ultrafiltration nanofiltration membranes have received a lot of attention in the field of membranes it was chowdhury et al who were the first to use 3d p to create ro uf membranes 149 this fouling resistance would be considerably improved with the addition of an active layer it is particularly crucial to research pro since this method is still in the initial phase and has to be expedited to define suitable considerations prior to being used on a large scale 150 for the time being 3d p is critical to advancing scientific discovery and discovery furthermore 3d printed cylindrical layers should be investigated as a potential replacement for the standard flat type membranes now available on the market to achieve nanoscale manufacturing for applications like water treatment membranes 3d p requires new technology recent breakthroughs in 2 p technology on the other hand have the potential to be applied to the field of membrane research one of the most significant areas of upcoming study should be biomimetic purposes given that 3d p is an excellent technique aimed at replicating biological configurations a wide range of scientific domains have already profited from the findings of this type of inquiry although 3d p is often used in water harvesting research to produce biomimetic structures it has not yet been completely converted to membrane based water purification 74 furthermore the information available from existing research does not provide enough information concerning long term performance because of this it is equally important to consider the enduring performance of 3d printed thin coatings pilot scale research might be a good way to understand this better a significant amount of further study is required to enhance the deployment of 3d printing for water purification and to widen the range of applications the post treatment of 3d p spacers is a potential exploration subject since surface irregularity has previously been established to be a significant factor in the degree of biofouling formation among other things no currently available printing medium has shown to be long lasting or trustworthy enough to merit further exploration spacers for example maybe produced using the polyjet process which is relatively inexpensive due to the fact that the photo curable resins employed in this method were sensitive to temperature and light the finished product may deteriorate over time after being exposed to them as a result photopolymer spacers will be examined for their long term effectiveness additionally lee et al explore different 3d p technologies in feed spacer fabrication such as continuous liquid interface production crip and digital light processing dlp 55 151 in addition while investigating am techniques for spacer design functionality it is essential to examine their capacity to work with several materials surface imprint embedded 3d printing is a promising solution for obtaining difficult topography when a complex topography is required the ability to improve the precision of 3d printing materials may open the door to new application areas imprinting procedures considered as more beneficial than 3d p when it comes to the fabrication of polymer based objects particularly for biologically based inspection as a result surface imprinting may be used to generate materials resistant to biofouling or effective in microbial water treatment additionally by imprinting the surface of photocatalytic materials it is possible to make use of their unique properties to increase membrane performance finally future research might concentrate on designing and optimizing novel spacers which would use a range of computational models and experimental testing it was shown that a recommended technique for developing and accessing novel feed spacers for biodegradation and amplification regulation was both cost efficient and successful 5 drawbacks there are various drawbacks to using 3d p most of which may be attributed to the current stage of technical progress 3d p processes that now available are efficient in printing with great resolution in the z dimension the x and y axes on the other hand do not have the same accuracy when it comes to membrane constructions the thickness and porosity of the membrane play a significant role consequently extreme care must be taken to ensure that the axes accuracy is precisely controlled depending on the x y precision the layer porosity is challenging to change by 3d p despite the existing accuracy in the z scale being adequate even for ultrathin membranes additional issue with the present technique is the high cost of 3d printers which is prohibitively costly fdm printers are affordable however that cannot be said of the expenses of other types of 3d printers one of the most costly printing options are high resolution printers like polyjet which are so costly that their ink is out of reach for most users another disadvantage of the present technology is the long printing time it requires despite the fact that a short time duration required for printing makes 3d p more practicable for cleaning and recycling water premature failure of membranes created utilizing the fdm manufacturing technique is possible owing to component layer delamination enhancing the frequency with which membranes must be replaced in desalination and water treatment procedures the performance of fdm printed vesicles and module assemblies is restricted because of the considerable divergence from the desired model that occurs when using fdm furthermore it is unsuitable for commercial applications due to the difficulty of printing large numbers of membranes the diversity of 3d printing processes that may be used for membrane manufacturing will need the acquisition of knowledge and competence in membrane production printed membranes for water treatment procedures might not be straightforward and prior 3d p operators may need further training in membrane module configuration to be successful in their efforts the fabrication of layers with large configurations using 3d p might be problematic since it would need a significant amount of time particularly when the needed pore diameter is about 0 1 nm or less solutions such as the creation of 3d p having several printing nozzles and laser sources that may be operational in parallel were proposed by lowe et al 152 this strategy may aid in the improvement of printing speed although it is still questionable owing to the increased related costs an analysis of spacers manufactured utilizing fdm revealed the highest deviations from the original model still spacers generated through polyjet technology were shown to be the most accurate representation of an original design pressure reduction and power consumption were the highest for fdm printed spacers and they used the most energy in comparison spacers printed using fdm demonstrated the most significant development in mass transfer reducing concentration polarization and biofouling while simultaneously increasing the critical flow of latex particles additionally the sls printed spacers demonstrated a noteworthy increase in mass transfer with the polyjet and commercial spacers trailing closely behind 153 154 aside from that the surface roughness of the 3 printed samples and commercial spacer were assessed and compared after careful examination it was discovered that the surface of the polyjet printed spacer was the roughest followed by the surface of the sls manufactured spacer the fdm printed spacer had the lowest surface roughness among the three materials tested followed by the commercial spacer in order for germs to attach themselves to rough surfaces the roughness of the surface is required the polyjet printed spacer displayed a stronger tendency for bacterial adherence than any of the other spacers evaluated before finally sls printed spacers demonstrated lessening pressure loss among the investigated materials a few scholarly publications have been published in recent years that addressed the benefits of 3d p in spacers manufacture although the field is still in its infancy 121 122 131 as a result of its ability to provide views it is expected to be used by more researchers in the future nevertheless the technology is still in its infancy as a result of the ability to analyze complex spacer geometries previously calculated using cfd and the ability to manufacture complex structures using 3d printing its applicability is expected to expand as well 155 however although research studies on 3d p are still in their early stages research and academic publications are growing as the technology progresses using 3d p technology to construct membrane modules has revolutionized the design of membrane modules 156 it is projected to reduce the energy and chemicals required in seawater purification and wastewater cleaning facilities 157 consequently it is essential to review major technology components in a comprehensive report to accelerate this method 6 conclusions herein we provide an overview of using 3d p in cleaning water 3d p for water treatment membranes merits special consideration since water cleaning has emerged as the planet s persistent challenge demanding the development of high efficiency membranes as a result of 3d p it will be possible to lessen the cost of shipping through a compilation of critical research undertaken so far the objective of this article is to bring the consideration of researchers and technologists to the need to speed up development as 3d p grows it will impact various other study areas durability uniformity precision the flexibility to customize and the capacity to fabricate replacement components quickly are only a few of the benefits of additive manufacturing due to sustainable low risk accurate and relatively affordable production processes 3d p will have a significant role in developing membrane research in the future however even though 3d printers have been around for a long time and have been used in various technologies in the nano area to achieve this the invention of 3d fabricated water cleaning coatings continues to be an essential objective the study shows that manufacturing thin layer components or membrane reformation is crucial to realizing customized and exact 3d printed membrane manufacture considering the current state of things we can anticipate that as 3d p technology progresses to nanoscale precision this research investigates numerous 3d printing and surface imprinting procedures and current developments in 3d printing technology to enhance the design of membrane module components 3d printed spacers were the subject of more research than 3d printed membranes which was a significant difference this is partly due to a mismatch between the resolution of 3d printing technology and the precision required to construct membranes which has been noted before in addition to being widely employed in wastewater treatment surface imprinting may also have use in water detoxification surface imprinting technologies were becoming practical for the water management process fdm and sla 3d printing were inadequate for generating spacers due to their low mechanical strength and significant deviation from specifications respectively consequently the best solutions were determined to be polyjet and sls the performance of the 3d printed spacers was superior to that of commercial spacers and they also displayed improved mass transfer and less fouling more importantly it has been shown that 3d printed membranes perform far better than standard membranes in a range of applications by employing molecular imprinting photocatalytic materials such as titanium oxide may be utilized to create membranes that have increased functioning and are appropriate for usage in sun irradiation regions of the world i e tropic regions 3d p will play a more prominent role in water treatment in the future as researchers work to improve the resolution of

12804,halloysite nanotube hnt was incorporated in poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane to remove contaminants of emerging concern cec known as oxytetracycline otc which is extensively used in the aquaculture industry the presence of hnt in the pvdf matrix has improved the characteristics and separation of the pristine membrane this study evaluated the effectiveness of low concentration of hnt loading for treating otc molecules via direct contact membrane distillation dcmd which produced high flux recovery after ethanol cleaning the performance of pvdf hnt phnt membrane with 0 5 hnt loading was compared using immersion time of 5 and 15 s further improvement was carried out by reducing 500 μm of the membrane thickness to 250 and 100 μm the wetting characteristics were determined to achieve the desired properties of dcmd membrane and gain insights into the antifouling mechanism of phnt membrane the modified membrane using 5 s immersion time obtained a high liquid entry pressure and contact angle ca of 2 13 bar 0 34 and 140 3 10 respectively this membrane had removed 95 of otc molecules with a permeate flux of 5 52 l m2h a 38 4 increment in flux permeation with 98 removal was obtained after reducing the membrane thickness to 250 μm 7 64 l m2h the total and irreversible flux decline of this membrane was significantly low as a result the flux recovery obtained above 90 after ethanol cleaning including for membrane regeneration and long term operation investigation otc removal from the feed solution improved from 98 to 100 after the regeneration and long term operation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hnt immersion time and thickness oxytetracycline flux recovery dcmd 1 introduction recently the rapid animal production to support food security has created serious environmental issues such as release of pharmaceutical contaminants particularly antibiotics due to their excessive use as growth promoter and medicine to animal infection 1 2 antibiotics exhibit only 30 absorption in the digestive tract while the excesses are released into the water ecosystem via the body excretions 3 in some rural area the direct discharge of contaminated wastewater sludge with antibiotics to the aquatic environment and at household level has become a serious issue 4 meanwhile the conventional water treatment plants have limited capability to eliminate antibiotics from livestock and aquaculture wastewater low concentrations of antibiotics are detected up to μg l levels in surface water seawater groundwater and even drinking water have proved the persistence of antibiotics in the ecosystem 5 the world health organization who has made a similar remark about the increasing detection of trace levels of pharmaceuticals e g otc in drinking water surface water and groundwater most of which are 1 μg l meanwhile wastewater treatment effluents or wastewater discharge from poorly managed manufacturing sites contains higher concentrations of these pollutants 6 therefore this issue has attracted a great concern as it might build up a resistance ecosystem towards pathogenic organisms eliminating antibiotics from the water ecosystem has become a global imperative among the commonly used antibiotics oxytetracyclines otc from tetracycline group are one of the established veterinary drugs the high demand of otc in livestock industry is due to its ability to resist both gram positive and gram negative bacteria particularly to control the intestinal and respiratory infections 7 in term of chemical structure the existing of four fused benzene rings with multiple functional groups such as amide hydroxyl and tertiary amino groups provide the hydrophilic characteristics of otc molecules 8 the speciation of otc molecules occurs according to ph values which indirectly influences the chemistry of the feed solution resulting in transformation products and exhibits half life time within 6 h to 9 days e g in aquatic environments 9 10 previous studies have also reported that otc residue concentrations in the livestock industry are still range from 0 006 to 136 mg l 11 12 therefore several treatment processes have been implemented to remove otc molecules from water streams such as photocatalysis 13 15 adsorption 8 16 17 and recently membrane distillation md 18 19 from these studies some of them have applied intermediate otc concentrations range within 10 to 25 mg l via adsorption and md treatment processes 8 19 findings report that the introduction of hnt was successfully reduced the otc concentration in the feed solutions hnt is similar to kaolinite but it has an advance morphology of multiwalled nanotubular shaped crystal configuration which provides a high specific surface area to the hnt structure 20 21 the nanotube shaped of hnt is formed by the rolling of aluminosilicate layers due to the mismatch in consistency of sharing oxygen atoms between inner aluminium al and outer silica si and exhibit positive internal aluminol al oh and negative external siloxane si o si surfaces 22 current research has also shown that both covalent 23 24 and supramolecular or electrostatic interactions can be used to selectively modify hnt surfaces in terms of covalent modifications grafting organosilanes onto the outer surface of hnts enabled the development of effective supported catalysts for methyl methacrylate polymerization 25 on the other hand inorganic micelles capable of entrapping hydrophobic molecules were obtained by attaching octadecylphosphonic acid 26 and dopamine derivatives 25 27 to the alumina groups of the internal hnt surface moreover electrostatic interactions between hnts surfaces and amphiphilic molecules surfactants 28 30 polymers 31 32 or enzymes 33 can produce functionalized hnt with specific properties the interactions of hnt positive lumen and the head group of anionic surfactants e g sodium alkanoates 30 34 35 sodium perfluoroalkanoates 28 sodium dodecylsulfate 30 resulted in modified hnt with a hydrophobic lumen study reported that introducing an anionic surfactant to the interior surface of hnt enhanced their net negative charge increasing electrostatic repulsions and thereby dispersion stability 36 it was proved that mixing hnts with anionic surfactants yielded pickering emulsions for oil spill remediation 37 38 for instance sodium alkanoates hnts hybrids can be applied for bioremediation due to their capacity to capture aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons from aqueous and gas phases 35 the functionalized hnt can act as removal agents for decontamination purposes due to their ability to entrap aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons inside their hydrophobically modified lumen 35 the usage of hnt based micellar systems has a variety of benefits including a lower amount of organic surfactant which is far below its critical micellar concentration and a near zero concentration of free surfactant molecules the hydrophobic lumen permits encapsulation of neutral and hydrophobic molecules while the solid polar shell offers stability for hnt dispersion in water and retention of encapsulated molecules 39 these appealing systems allow for a variety of applications including drug immobilization 40 and water purification 35 hence hnt and its composites have been applied in several treatments such as ultrafiltration membrane for bovine serum albumin bsa separation 21 membrane pervaporation for the separation of n butanol aqueous solution 41 adsorption 8 and md membrane 19 for otc removal however incorporation of hnt in polymer membrane modification has received limited attention mainly in md membrane development md process requires high wetting resistance properties to maintain performance efficiency including surface hydrophobicity liquid entry pressure lep and morphology these properties of md membrane assist the thermally driven separation process in which only water vapor can pass through the membrane pores as permeate even though md has been widely established for desalination process it is also a potential process for otc non volatile compound separation as only volatile molecules can penetrate the pores moreover the hydrophilic characteristic of otc will eventually assist its removal due to the hydrophobic interaction occurs during md process the otc removal can be further improved by the introduction of functional groups on the hydrophobic md membrane surface using filler incorporation apart from nanoparticles nano clays like hnt are selected as an alternative filler in md membrane fabrication therefore the interaction mechanism between hnt and pvdf as well as otc separation mechanism have been illustrated in our previous study 19 however fabrication parameters of prepared membrane not only involve the modification of hnt in pvdf matrix but also includes the immersion time and membrane thickness investigation for the improvement of membrane permeability a study by syawaliah and team presented the effect of immersion time for ultrafiltration membrane they found that the duration of immersion time was significantly affect the characteristics and performances of the prepared membranes 42 the effect of immersion time on the membrane structure is highly dependent on the system components and concentrations during phase demixing process 43 a high affinity between non solvent and polymer induces slower precipitation with delayed demixing process liquid liquid phase separation thus a more symmetric structure is formed sukitpaneenit and co worker reported that the increasingly weak non solvent could lead to the formation of interconnected globular structure with the presence of spherical globules from the semi crystalline pvdf 44 consequently it increased the fragility of the membrane therefore an alternative of using weak non solvent such as ethanol and methanol is proposed a study investigated the precipitation rate of pvdf membrane during demixing process using methanol and ethanol as coagulation bath was performed the immersion precipitation rate was influenced differently by different alcohol based non solvents in altering the formation of pore for membrane morphology they discovered that using methanol and ethanol as coagulation bath had changed the solution solid liquid demixing profile that gave different polymer morphology crystallinity and structural stability 45 furthermore there are limited findings reported on the optimal membrane thickness regarding md membrane specifically for direct contact membrane distillation dcmd 46 47 the membrane thickness is significantly influenced the performance of the prepared membrane in md process the application of thin membrane for pure water shows high flux along the md operation however eykens and team reported that a high feed concentration e g high salinity could severely reduce the flux and energy efficiency when using thin membranes which could only be implemented if there was sufficient driving force 47 this statement emphasized that the feed concentration highly influenced the water vapor permeation as the operation process involved thermal conductivity bulk temperature difference and flow velocity for the separation process to work efficiently therefore a limited study on fabrication parameters for md membrane has attracted our attention to perform further experimental investigation in this study non solvent induced phase separation nips was applied for the formation of hydrophobic pvdf hnt membrane by dual immersion process methanol and water nips was chosen because the rate of pvdf crystallization during the liquid liquid demixing process had a substantial effect on the structure of the prepared membrane 43 nips also generates diverse structure high selectivity and only required low operation temperature 48 therefore the objectives of this work are to investigate the effects of fabrication parameters immersion time membrane thickness and coagulation bath temperature on membrane permeability selectivity and antifouling properties of the developed hydrophobic pvdf hnt membrane the evaluation of flux recovery on the selected membranes was conducted to determine the reusability of potential membrane after five cycle of membrane regeneration and long term operation processes this study is a step forward for more investigation oriented approach in developing an md membrane that meets industrial requirements 2 experimental 2 1 materials pvdf solef 6010 1001 powder was purchased from solvay solexis france non toxic triethyl phosphate tep methanol absolute ethanol for analysis were acquired from merck darmstadt germany hnt filler with diameter of 30 70 nm and length of 1 3 μm was supplied by sigma aldrich this filler has specific surface area of 50 150 m2 g and achieves its stability up to 460 c due to the de hydroxylation oxytetracycline hydrochloride mw 496 89 g mol λmax 275 nm molecular formula c22h24n2o9 hcl cas 2058 46 0 was obtained from nano life quest sdn bhd in powder form and classified in the cec group of antibiotics distilled water was used in the second coagulation bath during immersion precipitation 2 2 preparation of phnt membranes via immersion precipitation the preparation method of phnt0 5 membrane was successfully implemented in our previous study for otc removal 19 therefore in this study the previous method was further applied to investigate the applicable immersion time and membrane thickness for the improvement of flux permeation the result of otc removal flux permeability and wetting characteristics of 0 5 hnt loading showed a high potential to be modified for better membrane permeation further experiment was carried out to improve membrane permeation by reducing the immersion time in pure methanol from 15 min to 15 s and 5 s the modified 0 5 hnt membrane by 5 s immersion time was compared with the wetting characteristics and membrane permeability of modified membrane using different nominal thickness of 250 and 100 μm respectively the nominal thickness was defined as the gap of the casting knife before the casting process whereas the actual thickness was measured with a scanning electron microscope sem finally the membrane with 250 μm thickness setting was further investigated for different water coagulation bath temperatures table 1 shows the preparation of the phnt membranes for 0 5 concentration 2 3 membrane characterization membrane distillation requires several criteria of anti wetting properties to ensure an efficient distillation process contact angle ca is a measurement of water repellent properties for membrane surfaces the ca was calculated by the sessile drop technique of a goniometer rame hart 250 f 1 usa approximately 6 μl of a water droplet was set up on the membrane surface and the reading was recorded this step was repeated in several areas to measure the consistency of the hydrophobic angle between droplets and surfaces due to the immersion in pure methanol the ca of all membranes was expected to exceed 90 other than ca liquid entry pressure lep and pore size are considered important factors for separation and permeation processes specifically direct contact membrane distillation dcmd i e the simplest configuration both factors were determined using a porolux 1000 porometer benelux scientific belgium for lep water was used as a high surface tension liquid 72 dynes cm to avoid direct absorption of water in the pores the lep reading was measured by the first bubble point after nitrogen n2 flowed meanwhile the pore size of the prepared membrane was examined using a membrane with 20 mm diameter after immersion in porefil 16 0 dynes cm low surface tension liquid for 1 h the pore size measurement was obtained after the wet and dry curves were recorded the porosity of the prepared membrane is one of the consequences of the membrane permeation rate behavior the prepared membranes of 1 cm 1 cm were immersed in porefil for 1 h then the mass of wet membranes m1 was recorded and dried at 70 c in an oven for 24 h and the mass of dry membranes m2 was obtained all the details were used for porosity ɛ calculation using eq 1 1 ε m 1 m 2 ρ 1 m 1 m 2 ρ 1 m 2 ρ 2 x 100 where ρ1 and ρ2 are the wetting liquid density porefil 1 87 g m3 and polymer density pvdf 1 78 g m3 respectively tensile strength and elongation at break of the prepared membranes were determined by an instron testing machine model 3366 norwood ma usa with the pulling rate of 0 5 mm s the membranes were prepared according to astm d882 standards which is suitable for sample with a thickness of 1 mm the elastic modulus of prepared membranes was evaluated by the stress strain curve the surface and cross section structures of the prepared membranes were examined using a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi tm3000 tabletop microscope hitachi ltd japan at magnifications of 500 and 2 0kx the energy of beam was set to 5 kv 15 kv or analy mode with working distance of 0 5 1 5 mm according to the sample conditions during the analysis the surface pore size sps was manually measured to compare the formation of surface pores after introducing to different parameters modifications e g immersion time membrane thickness and coagulation bath temperature including the actual membrane thickness the cross section structures were characterized after the samples fractured in n2 and gold coated to obtain more clear images surface roughness of selected membranes was analyzed using atomic force microscopy afm ultraobjective the samples were measured at a scan size of 10 μm 10 μm the nanoscope analysis software was used to measure the mean roughness ra of the scanned area fourier transform infrared spectroscopic ftir thermo scientific nicolet nexus 670 was used to determine the functional group of the hnt powder and the membrane with the presence of hnt the transmittance bands of the selected membranes were performed in the range of 500 cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 2 4 dcmd performance for permeability and otc removal this study applied the simplest md configuration dcmd as an alternative separation process to remove low otc concentration 10 ppm in aqueous solution a laboratory scale of dcmd setup is shown in fig 1 with an effective membrane area of 47 5 cm2 the temperature of the feed and permeate solutions were set and fixed as in our previous study 19 for all the prepared membranes of different fabrication parameters throughout the process the flow rates at both hot and cold sides were constantly maintained to 252 36 ml min one litre of otc solution feed was continuously operated for 3 h after flowing with distilled water 3 h a selected phnt0 5 membrane was then carried out for regeneration and long term operation study the regeneration study was performed until 5 cycle operation by 3 h of each otc separation process whereas 24 h was required to complete the long term operation study the mass of permeate solution was weighed with an electronic balance connected to a computer for every 60 s interval the otc rejection was determined by the calculation of the concentration of feed and permeate solutions which were analyzed using an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer cary 60 uv vis agilent technologies two equations were applied to calculate the permeate flux and otc separation as denoted in eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 j w a t where j is the water vapor flux in l m2 h δw is the mass of permeate solution l a is the effective area of membrane m2

transfer across the membrane temperature polarization coefficient tpc is the function of boundary layer resistance on both feed and permeate side of the membrane it indicates the efficiency of the md process the tpc decline is primarily in the range of 0 4 tpc 0 7 49 when the process is limited by mass transfer it approaches unity for the well proposed system the high heat resistance of boundary layers causes the tpc to approach zero in a poorly built system as a result this process is limited by heat transfer 50 4 tpc t fm t pm t fb t pb where tfb and tpb are the bulk temperatures at feed and permeate sides tfm and tpm are the temperatures of the liquid vapor interface at the membrane surface pores of the feed and permeate sides respectively the relation between mass and heat transfer across the membrane from the feed to the permeate must be identified in order to calculate the tpc eqs 5 6 quantifies the heat transported across the feed and permeate boundary layers whereas eq 7 defines the heat transferred through the membrane 5 q f h f t fb t fm 6 q p h p t pm t pb 7 q q c q v k m δ t fm t pm j h v where q is the heat transfer across the membrane hf and hp refer to the heat

modified membranes for different immersion times and thickness setting were further tested for flux recovery after each cycle of treatment these membranes were immersed in ethanol and left in a shaker for 30 min the membranes were then transferred into distilled water for a few minutes before dried overnight then the membranes were tested with distilled water for 3 h to evaluate the water flux recovery after cleaning the flux recovery ratio frr fouling reduction rate frr total flux decline ratio tfdr irreversible flux decline ratio ifdr and normalized flux were calculated for all modified

flux nf was calculated to evaluate the antifouling properties of the modified membranes 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fabrication parameters on the membrane characteristics pvdf membrane morphology after direct water immersion was compared to pvdf membrane morphology after a dual immersion method methanol and water to determine which should be modified further methanol was selected in this study because it precipitated faster than ethanol during the delay demixing process which facilitated the formation of larger pores size of the prepared membrane 45 and enhanced the wetting resistance properties e g ca and lep compared to direct water immersion 51 fig 2 shows the characteristics and real samples of both membranes the pristine membrane by direct water immersion has formed a thinner membrane layer with symmetric structure compared to the dual immersion process even though the membrane formed symmetric structure the ca value was 90 indicating as hydrophilic surface in fact the phase inversion of direct water immersion should result in faster demixing and formed finger like structure which is opposite with the result shown in fig 2a this could be owing to the use of tep solvent which caused the formation of sponge like structure particularly at high pvdf concentration 18 wt tep is a weaker solvent for the polymer than typical hazard solvent and tends to promote large spherulites even when a harsh bath e g water is used due to the crystallization phenomenon 52 the pvdf polymer chains curled more in tep which could be due to the higher steric encumbrance and slightly weaker interactions with polymer chains moreover kinetic studies by previous research reported that water passed more slower in the tep solution than n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp resulting in a slower solvent non solvent exchange rate during phase inversion 53 in general a high polymer concentration raises the viscosity of the polymer solution and slows tep water exchange resulting in a spongy matrix with a narrow porous surface moreover the formation of different types of membrane structure was related to the types of solvent and non solvent used which have an important role in the delay demixing process therefore the purpose of dual coagulation bath is to induce the early onset of solid liquid demixing that could enhance the pvdf crystallization in alpha phase 54 the less affinity between polymer solvent resulted in a lower precipitation rate of polymer via the formation of sponge like structures the lower water absorption capacity of dual coagulation bath proving the higher hydrophobicity than the direct water immersion membrane that showed by ca measurements 55 moreover methanol has high tendency to reduce pore collapsing compared to water due to its lower surface tension property which indirectly maintained the formation of membrane pore size during drying process 56 as a result the process led to the different surface structure and thickness layer of the prepared membranes introducing methanol as a pre coagulant bath improved the membrane structure of the pristine pvdf membrane and resulted in a hydrophobic ca range 90 with a larger pore size fig 2c from this comparison it shows that tep solvent tend to induce slower exchange rate due to its chemical properties and thus forming symmetric structure due to the improvement after using methanol during the casting process further pvdf membrane modification on the fabrication parameters was carried out by the dual immersion process the scanning electron microscopy sem images of the of phnt0 5 membranes for different immersion time and membrane thickness are shown in fig 3 all membranes formed identical surface and cross sectional morphologies the alteration of sps upon the reduction of immersion time and thickness setting was shown in fig 3 a c e g i and fig 3 b d f h j respectively the immersion time during coagulation process influenced the sps and thickness of phnt0 5 membranes the formation of a sponge like structure in the membrane support layer was induced by the contact time between the cast solution with the pure methanol during casting process which facilitated the anti wettability of the inner layer the anti wettability of the inner layer could be identified by the measurement of liquid entry pressure lep this parameter measures the resistance of high surface tension liquid e g water from immediate penetration into the membrane pores by introducing an external pressure of n2 a low lep value indicates the less wetting resistance of the inner layer of the prepared membrane the minimum practical lep value for md is 1 bar and the value should not exceed 3 bars as it will affect membrane permeability this wetting parameter may be affected by the alteration of sps porosity thickness and pore shape finger like or sponge like structure 57 58 in fig 3 the reduction of immersion time to 15 s 1 83 0 01 μm and 5 s 2 50 0 12 μm obtained greater sps compared to 15 min 1 64 0 10 μm reducing the immersion time has increased 20 of the membrane thickness from 238 μm to 262 μm phnt0 5 15 and 264 μm phnt0 5 5 respectively this result was due to the desolvation of solvent into the coagulation bath which influenced the formation of membrane layer a dense layer forms when solvent in the casting solution desolvates before the coagulant medium diffuses into the casting solution whereas the porous layer forms when the coagulant medium diffuses into the casting solution before the desolvation of solvent occurs 55 therefore the less contact time of casting solution with first coagulant bath methanol had enlarged the pore size during immersion process due to the enhancement of delay solvent non solvent exchange rate with water as second coagulant bath hence led to a thicker and symmetric membrane layer this statement is consistent with the results obtained in fig 3 c d and e f in which lower immersion time 5 s increased sps value with higher membrane thickness further investigation on thickness setting of 5 s immersion time was carried out to obtain a thinner membrane layer which is more applicable to be applied for md process the nominal thickness of 250 μm and 100 μm decreased to the actual membrane thickness of 134 μm and 71 μm respectively as shown in sem images the difference between the actual thickness and the nominal thickness was due to the solvent evaporation and polymer molecular structure rearrangement during the drying process a rapid solvent evaporation resulted in faster polymer deposition speed as less layers were involved in the membrane formation 59 60 therefore a difference value of the membrane thickness layer was obtained after the formation of a dried solid membrane meanwhile the sps values was increased up to 2 67 0 38 μm and 2 54 0 18 μm for phnt0 5 5 250 and phnt0 5 5 100 membranes kusworo et al 2017 reported in their study that the lower immersion time could increase the pore size of the membrane 61 relatively the application of 5 s of immersion time with less nominal thickness indirectly enhanced the delay exchange rate of solvent non solvent hence it formed thin membrane layer with larger sps and improved the membrane permeability which will be elaborated in the next section the incorporation of hnt in the pvdf matrix significantly affects the mechanical stability of the resultant pvdf hnt membranes as shown in fig 4 the presence of 0 5 hnt in the pvdf matrix phnt0 5 has lowered the tensile strength to 1 04 mpa with maximum elongation at break of 36 75 and elastic modulus of 44 24 mpa compared to the pristine membrane this could be due to a decrease in pvdf content in the membrane matrix as well as strong interactions between polymer chains and hnt which reduced molecule movement 62 moreover zou et al 2022 reported that membrane with lower pvdf concentrations have poorer tensile strength than those with greater concentrations 63 thus the mechanical stability of the phnt0 5 membrane was lower however the modification on different immersion time at constant nominal thickness did not highly affect the mechanical stability of the pvdf hnt membranes the shorter immersion time in methanol produced larger sps refer fig 3a c e that seemed to slightly reduce the tensile strength of the membrane phnt0 5 5 refer fig 4a this demonstrates that when stress is applied to the phnt0 5 5 membrane it deforms quickly the applied stress may cause particular sections of the membrane to crack resulting in decreased tensile strength meanwhile the slightly higher elastic modulus of the phnt0 5 5 membrane could be owing to a transient increase in applied stress at a specific location before it completely breaks altering the elastic modulus value as shown in fig 4b this could be related with the formation of larger pore size and the porosity of the prepared membrane that influenced the differential force acting on it refer fig 3 and table 2 moreover phnt0 5 5 250 membrane with nominal thickness of 250 μm demonstrated exceptional mechanical stability than 500 μm with a tensile strength of 1 07 mpa a maximum elongation of 94 05 and an elastic modulus of 49 30 mpa the least stress was applied to this membrane resulting in a higher strain and visible deformation consequently the elongation at break and tensile strength of this membrane were increased compared to other pvdf hnt membranes this was indicated as a result of the well distributed hnt particles during the casting process which aided mechanical stability at lower thickness layers in addition hnt can aid inter chain sliding resulting in a high elongation value 64 the most significant wetting resistance properties of md membranes are defined by surface hydrophobicity and membrane wettability these properties were evaluated by the lep and ca measurements as shown in fig 5 as mentioned in the previous paragraph lep is a crucial parameter to maintain the wettability of the prepared membranes particularly for long term operation even though 1 bar of lep is applicable for md operation the wettability of the prepared membrane could slowly decline once it is utilized therefore in this study the lep of all prepared membranes was duplicated and successfully achieved 1 5 bar this outcome was expected to assist the wettability of these membranes after repeated cycles of otc separation hence maintaining the rejection percentage from the graph fig 5a the reduction of immersion time to 5 s obtained the highest ca of 140 3 10 with lep of 2 13 bar 0 34 the results of prepared membranes showed an ascending trend of ca while descending trend not 1 5 bar obtained by lep the formation of larger pores has significantly affected the reduction of lep and their relation was reported in a study by mcgaughey et al 2020 65 a less dense surface structure of phnt0 5 5 membrane was formed due to the formation of thin entangling string like structure fig 3e which improved the surface roughness and increased the pores size compared to denser sponge like structure of phnt0 5 membrane fig 3a thus lower immersion time during casting process has significantly increased the ca but decreased the lep of the prepared membrane the implementation of less thickness setting of 250 μm and 100 μm using the similar formulation of phnt0 5 5 membrane obtained a different trend but it still in the range of wetting characteristic requirements the result in fig 5b shows that decreasing the thickness setting could decrease both ca and lep of the prepared membranes the ca of phnt0 5 5 membranes using 250 μm phnt0 5 5 250 and 100 μm phnt0 5 5 100 has reduced to 131 2 52 and 132 0 03 respectively even though the lep values have decreased to 1 65 bar 0 13 and 1 74 bar 0 01 both are still applicable for further investigation in this study as it met the required range for md application this consequence was suggested due to the enlargement of membrane pore size the thinner membrane could facilitate a faster exchange rate between solvent and non solvent during immersion process and eventually led to the formation of larger pore size it happened due to the less polymer solution volume during the immersion process a lesser amount of concentrated polymer solution was thermodynamically more stable and accelerated kinetics due to less thick layer markedly reduced the time for the membrane to precipitate 66 hence increased pore size and reduced wetting characteristics of the prepared membranes the investigation on the fabrication parameters of prepared membranes was significantly altered the membrane characteristics the prepared pvdf hnt membranes attained a porous membrane structure with high porosity of 85 92 as shown in table 2 however the phnt0 5 15 membrane obtained the lowest porosity among the prepared membranes a higher error bar value of this membrane porosity 85 1 39 indicates the possibility of low interfacial adhesion of hnt loading on pvdf matrix at 15 s of immersion time the formation of uneven pores within the membrane areas led to the large different porosity and thus increased the error bar meanwhile the porosity of phnt0 5 5 membrane has maintained its porous structure and formed more stable pores due to the lower error bar value 86 0 11 compared to phnt0 5 86 0 20 and phnt0 5 15 membranes further investigation on phnt0 5 5 membrane showed a different result on membrane porosity the low thickness setting was significantly increased the membrane porosity to 90 92 respectively the lower thickness 250 and 100 μm and shorter duration of immersion process 5 s in methanol have influenced a higher rate of demixing process of polymer solution compared to 500 μm and 15 min which tend to form larger membrane pores the formation of larger sps in fig 3g and i is consistence to the result obtained by the percentages porosity moreover the surface roughness of selected membranes was characterized to study the impact of hnt presence in the pvdf matrix on the physicochemical properties of membranes from the ca result the addition of hnt in the pvdf matrix was significantly improved this result was consistence with the 3d afm surface graphs of pristine pvdf and phnt0 5 5 250 membranes as shown in fig 6 the pristine membrane allowed the membrane to have surface roughness with a ra value of 165 nm fig 6a after the incorporation of hnt in the membrane matrix the surface roughness become more prominent with ra values of 189 nm fig 6b this was due to the increment of hnt particles in the pvdf matrix which led to the formation of large nodular morphology area as well as dual coagulation bath that induced lower surface energy 67 hence it improved wetting resistance due to its higher surface tension with water meanwhile membrane porosity was found to increase with the membrane average pore size as tabulated in table 3 which eventually improved the membrane performance as discussed in section 3 2 from this study the properties of this pvdf hnt membrane have met the requirements of membrane characteristics for md application the characteristics results of prepared membranes were indirectly influenced by the nature of hnt as mentioned earlier the nanotubular structure of hnt facilitates a well dispersion in the pvdf matrix due to the presence of inner surface of al oh group while the outer layer has been covered by si oh group the presence of both groups was allocated around 902 cm 1 and 989 cm 1 by ftir analysis respectively naturally hnt is one of hydrophilic fillers that contained abundant of oh group due to the availability of si oh on the outer layer the oh bands were indicated by two identical wavenumbers at 3619 cm 1 and 3624 cm 1 as shown in fig 7a 68 however the blending of hnt in pvdf matrix has caused the absence of oh bands present in hnt as observed in fig 7b simultaneously it induced the shifting of cf band by the hydrogen bonding interaction between al oh groups and fluorine of pvdf chains with reduction of band intensity at 773 cm 1 meanwhile the linkage of si oh groups onto the pvdf chain was shifted to 1175 cm 1 with lower intensity compared to the band of pvdf membrane the absence of hydroxyl groups in pvdf hnt chains might be due to the exchange of hydroxyl group in methanol with unbonded hydrogen existed on pvdf hnt chains during phase inversion process consequently this interaction influenced higher hydrophobicity and surface roughness of the prepared membranes further investigation was carried out on the time evolution of ca after the deposition on the membrane surface to quantify their permeability to liquid water fig 8 shows the permeability of the liquid water droplet into the matrix which summarized the variation of ca within 3600 s from the graph different fabrication parameters after the addition of hnt not only improved the ca but the water droplet was insignificantly changed within 120 s spreading and absorption are two main effects that influence the droplet evolution therefore from the graph all the prepared membranes were attributed to experience absorption rather than spreading due to the ca values 90 however the wetting behaviors of hydrophobic membrane surface are similar to hydrophilic surface but with a slower absorption rate at the early stage which forms a shoulder region once the water droplet in contact with the surface 69 this statement consistence with the pristine membrane that observed to slightly decrease after 120 s due to less hydrophobic surface the lowest ca value compared to other modified membranes the absorption phenomena that occurred on the membrane surfaces might be affected by the impact velocity wettability and surface morphology 70 71 due to the test conducted at a height of 0 m the impact velocity was insignificant in this study however in term of wettability the prepared membranes obtained different surface wettability after 3600 s of droplet deposition wenzel claims that high surface roughness amplifies both wetting and liquid repellence 72 surface roughness promotes wetting if ca 90 and it increases liquid repellence if ca 90 as long as the pore size of the surface morphology is considerably lower than the water droplet size 73 75 moreover the surface tension on drop spreading between 50mnm 1 and 73mnm 1 e g water has been investigated to have only minor effect to the water absorption 76 hence the droplet evolution of prepared membranes was decreased depending on the obtained ca due to the formation of different surface roughness and sps value furthermore the formation of isotropic porous structure of all prepared membranes generated the similar trend of the water droplet evolution however in md process the dynamic behavior of droplet absorption using md simulation has no air trapping in the pores due to the absence of air 77 the impact velocity could increase the contact diameter of the droplet which indicated that the absorption time is smaller than the retraction time with consideration of kinetic energy to surface energy and volume conservation the absorption process is determined by the pore size and inertia and indirectly facilitates the permeability and selectivity of the md process 3 2 effect of fabrication parameters on the performance of phnt0 5 membranes the crucial factors of the prepared membranes are their permeability and selectivity in this study the aim of the prepared membranes is to treat the antibiotic found in livestock and aquaculture wastewaters specifically otc and simultaneously obtain good water vapor permeability therefore fig 9a presents the membrane permeability and fig 9b shows the otc removal using the prepared phnt0 5 membranes before and after modification among the prepared membranes phnt0 5 5 100 membrane could not be further tested for its performances due to a sudden rupture red circle after 1 h of permeation test as shown in fig 9c the phnt0 5 membrane was further investigated to improve flux permeation by immersing the cast dope solution at different immersion times of pre non solvent prior to the water bath in comparison 5 s of immersion time for the phnt0 5 5 membrane showed an improvement in flux permeation when the contact time of cast dope solution with methanol was reduced refer to fig 9 the average permeate flux improved up to 5 52 l m2h which is about 10 improvement compared to 15 min of immersion time 4 97 l m2h however a different outcome was obtained after immersing the cast phnt0 5 solution for 15 s the average permeate flux decreased insignificantly to 4 85 l m2h due to the later flux stability after 1 h operation consequently a longer immersion time could lead to the formation of an over dense bottom layer while reducing the flux permeation 78 moreover the longer immersion time 15 s would form a closer surface structure with an sps value of 1 83 μm 0 01 whereas the immersion time of 5 s improved the sps up to 2 50 μm 0 17 as shown in fig 10 a previous study reported that the formation of pores and interconnectivity within the membrane structure would also affect by the temperature of the coagulation bath thereby influencing the rate of polymer precipitation and the exchange rate between non solvent and solvent of polymer solution 79 for this study the illustration of formation of a dense bottom layer is proposed in fig 10 the figure explains that during immersion precipitation methanol molecules non solvent diffused deep inside the cast dope solution and solidified pvdf hnt chains around them simultaneously the molecules tend to move the nearby pvdf hnt chains towards the glass plate due to the poor affinity between them the slow diffusion rate of the non solvent at longer immersion time using pure methanol solution inhibited the pvdf hnt chains from being immediately solidified and moved to the bottom as a result more area of pvdf hnt chains gathered at the interface between the cast dope solution and the glass plate therefore the phnt0 5 15 membrane formed a denser inner layer compared to the loose inner layer of phnt0 5 5 membrane with well distribution of pvdf hnt chain refer to fig 10 this hypothesis is relevant to the formation of the membrane thickness and sps values of phnt0 5 15 min of immersion precipitation and the phnt0 5 15 15 s of immersion precipitation membranes as shown in fig 3b and d hence from this study the optimal membrane for the effect of immersion time was obtained by immersing the membrane in methanol for 5 s and then in water for another 24 h the optimal immersion time of pre coagulation bath methanol was applied for the different thickness investigation on the phnt0 5 5 membrane due to the sudden rupture of phnt0 5 5 100 membrane during performance test only phnt0 5 5 250 membrane was compared for its performances with other prepared membranes an improvement was obtained in otc permeate flux for phnt0 5 5 250 membrane the membrane flux has increased up to 7 64 l m2h for 3 h permeation test which is almost 30 improvement in membrane permeability however the fluctuating flux values in fig 9a might be due to the water vapor pressure change along the md process which predominantly dependent on heat loss from the feed temperature 80 in comparison with previous study the flux rate of the prepared membrane is almost similar as it obtained the same range of surface roughness 81 they found that higher surface roughness had improved the flux rate of the prepared membrane thus due to a slight increase of surface roughness for phnt0 5 5 250 membrane than the pristine fig 6b it still showed some improvement in flux permeation with better otc removal 98 rejection overall a nominal thickness of 250 μm produced the best thickness for the prepared phnt0 5 5 membrane 5 s of immersion time these results are agreed with the membrane characterization as described in the previous section particularly sps value 2 67 0 38 μm and porosity percentage 90 the characterization of this membrane facilitated a higher permeation rate of water vapor passing through the pores hence a higher flux permeation was obtained additionally different coagulation bath temperatures were investigated to determine the characteristics and performance of the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane for former fabrication parameters all the prepared membranes were constantly immersed in coagulation bath at 20 21 c after casting process therefore 10 c and 50 c of coagulation bath temperatures were selected to investigate the effect of different casting conditions on the performances of optimal phnt0 5 5 250 membrane fig 11 displayed the membrane characteristics and performances obtained after immersing the phnt0 5 5 250 casting solution in different coagulation bath temperatures the membrane immersed in 10 c coagulation bath phnt0 5 5 250 cb10 has increased the thickness layer to 176 μm with smaller sps of 1 81 μm and slightly reduced the ca to 129 as shown in fig 11a on the other hand the membrane immersed in 50 c phnt0 5 5 250 cb50 showed no significant change of pore size and thickness compared to phnt0 5 5 250 membrane however 50 c of the coagulation bath has slightly altered the membrane surface structure as shown in fig 11b the cold temperatures e g 10 c and 20 c has formed entangling string like structure while warm temperature produced flower like structure that slightly improved porosity to 92 the obtained membrane porosity is aligned with the formation of sps and the permeation of otc permeate flux refer fig 11c in fig 11c the otc permeate flux at 10 c obtained the lowest permeability compared to 20 c and 50 c the average flux at 50 c is almost closed to phnt0 5 5 250 membrane with stable permeability upon 3 h this shows that at higher temperatures the non solvent solvent exchange rate is accelerated due to rapid phase separation kinetics which results in greater pore size higher porosity and a thinner thickness layer 82 as a result the flux permeability of the prepared membranes is improved in addition all of the prepared membrane using different coagulation bath temperature had similar selectivity after 3 h of operation process 98 of otc rejection as depicted in fig 11d therefore due to the insignificant differences between 20 c and 50 c of modified membranes this study has selected 20 c modified membrane within the ambient temperature range for further flux recovery investigation overall a higher flux permeation and slightly lower selectivity of phnt0 5 5 250 membrane than phnt0 5 membrane were influenced by the formation of larger pore size which suggested due to the mass transfer mechanism in dcmd the viscous flow model is frequently neglected because both feed and permeate solutions are in direct contact with membrane under atmospheric conditions therefore the total pressure remains constant at atmospheric pressure resulting in negligible viscous flow 83 previous research has looked at the flow model prediction on pore sizes that are similar to the pore size measured in this work which increased from 0 39 μm phnt0 5 to 0 44 μm phnt0 5 5 250 at temperatures ranging from 15 to 48 c minimum and 60 to 75 c maximum throughout the dcmd process they found that the estimated mean free path for water vapor obtained slightly lower 0 13 to 0 16 μm than the range of membrane pore size 0 18 to 0 45 μm hence the knudsen number k n has fall within the transition region 0 01 k n 10 and leading to knudsen molecular diffusion 84 85 from this study the improved permeability of the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane with slightly lower selectivity was caused by suspected knudsen molecular diffusion during the dcmd process as it is one of the most accurate predictions of flux for dcmd 3 3 effect of different thickness layer on heat transfer across the membrane heat transfer across the membranes was calculated using the variables parameters displayed in tables 4 5 and 6 the optimized membrane parameters for good permeate flux performance are suggested to have thickness range of 10 to 700 μm depending upon the mass transport and energy loss porosity higher than 75 thermal conductivity in the range of 0 06 w mk and a suitable mechanical strength depends on the membrane material and thickness 86 from this study the value obtained for thickness porosity and thermal conductivity of the prepared membranes are in the range of the suggested value of optimized membrane parameters as shown in table 4 meanwhile the effect of different thickness layer on heat transfer across the membranes and thermal efficiency is depicted in fig 12 in fig 12a heat of conduction qc for phnt0 5 5 membrane thick is 4065 78 w m2 while phnt0 5 5 250 membrane thin has increased up to 5056 65 w m2 respectively this shows that the heat transfer through the thin membrane was greater than that across the thicker membrane due to the heat loss by conduction however the higher flux obtained by thin membrane was suggested due to the increase of vaporization heat qv 5491 63 w m2 during the process than qc consequently it generated more water vapor which influenced the improvement of flux permeation generally the driving force reduction is frequently stated as tpc which typically ranges from 0 to 1 when the tpc drops below 0 2 the process is considered as heat transfer limited implying poor design meanwhile tpc higher than 0 6 indicates a mass transfer limited mechanism with low membrane permeability and the tpc range of 0 4 to 0 7 is deemed satisfactory 49 in this study the tpc values of both membranes could be considered in satisfactory range with values of 0 45 phnt0 5 5 and 0 32 phnt0 5 5 250 respectively the result indicates that the heat loss is not a controlling parameter in this case it was suggested due to less thickness of the prepared membrane that influenced the flux permeation including higher porosity and lower thermal conductivity 87 moreover the presence of hnt in thin layer might facilitated a higher flux permeation due to well distribution in polymer solution and low thermal conductivity property 88 a previous study stated that the thermal insulating filler could separate the polymer molecules and filled the space between the polymer molecules thus imparting a low thermal conductivity of the prepared membrane 87 consequently it induced more energy transferred by the water vapor hence increasing the flux permeability thus this study found that the thin thickness layer has influenced the improvement of flux and increased the thermal efficiency of phnt0 5 5 250 membrane to 52 06 instead of heat loss across the membrane the thermal efficiency is related to the thermal conductivity km of the produced membranes as shown in table 5 the calculation of thermal efficiency is provided in supplementary material sm1 al obaidani used mathematical modelling to determine the relationship between thermal conductivity and flux permeability he claimed that when thermal conductivity increased flux permeability and thermal efficiency decreased 89 a lower km value was discovered to have a higher thermal efficiency during the dcmd process than a higher km value according to a study the temperature difference between two sides of membrane e g tfm tpm for thickness within 150 to 200 μm ought to be 10 c and lower temperature difference could achieve higher thermal efficiency 86 therefore the lower km 0 05970 w mk and temperature difference on both sides tfm and tpm with high ɛ 90 which obtained by thin membrane might facilitate the vaporization heat during dcmd process and thus slightly increased the permeate flux and thermal efficiency of the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane than the phnt0 5 5 membrane 3 4 flux recovery of modified phnt0 5 membrane including regeneration and long term performances the normalized flux of phnt0 5 15 phnt0 5 5 and phnt0 5 5 250 membranes was evaluated and presented in fig 13a meanwhile fig 13b represents the flux recovery and fouling rate of these membranes after 3 h operation process relatively it is necessary to determine performance reversibility for the potential reusable prepared membranes among these membranes the 30 min of ethanol cleaning has significantly removed the fouling resistance of pvdf membrane with 0 5 hnt tian and co workers also found that cleaning using ethanol produced better improvement in flux recovery of the prepared membrane 90 hence this statement supports the result obtained in this study fig 13a shows that most of these three membranes have achieved normalized flux 1 00 of j jo ratio the change of vapor permeation rate was initiated after 1 h of membrane permeation and start to stabilize back at the third hour of separation process reducing the thickness setting with lower immersion time has facilitated a better flux permeability throughout 3 h permeation process compared to higher thickness setting and longer immersion time a good interfacial adhesion between pvdf hnt chains might assist the formation of decent membrane inner layer when applying both parameters 5 s immersion time and 250 μm of thickness setting and improved the performances of phnt0 5 5 250 membrane moreover investigation on flux recovery of these prepared membrane was further identified and proved to achieved high percentages as shown in fig 13b a complete flux recovery was obtained by phnt0 5 5 250 membrane after 3 h of separation process followed by 88 and 79 for phnt0 5 5 and phnt0 5 15 membranes respectively thus lower immersion time and reducing nominal thickness seem to facilitate higher flux recovery compared to higher variables of both parameters relatively the lowest values of tfdr ifdr and frr percentages for pht0 5 5 250 membrane revealed better resistance of organic fouling throughout dcmd 91 aside from partial wetting the calculated negative value of tfdr percentage by eq 18 described the higher penetration of water vapor molecules through the membrane pores during otc separation consequently the higher porosity of this membrane might initiate smaller conductive heat transfer coefficients of the vapor trapped in the pores than the materials of prepared membranes 92 hence reducing temperature polarization and increasing water vapor permeation the resultant antifouling properties of the prepared membranes can be clearly explained through the proposed illustration of process interactions occurring during cleaning as shown in fig 14 the figure shows that the hydrophobic surface of the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane facilitates water vapor permeation and otc removal during dcmd the non volatile otc molecules are attached to the hydrophobic surface by hydrogen bonding and electrical interaction allowing only water vapor to pass through the membrane pores however partial wetting will slowly occur during the operation thereby causing less hydrophobicity to the membrane surface and influencing the penetration of some otc molecules aside from membrane surface these molecules may attach to the inner layer of the membrane or leave the membrane layer depending on the pore interaction the cleaning process using pure ethanol assists the detachment of otc on the surface and inner layer of the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane the h atom of otc molecules attached to the f atom of the phnt surface is held by hydrogen bonding leading to the foulant layer however the weak hydrogen can alleviate the non hydrogen bonded molecules and initiate a weaker hydrogen bond strength hence removing the otc molecules 93 a previous study on the interaction of otc with ethanol aqueous mixture described that the density of otc could reduce in a higher concentration of ethanol at room temperature by increasing its negativity this outcome was due to the strong influence of otc solubility with the strength of the intermolecular forces among the dissolved otc and the surrounding ethanol molecules 94 therefore in this study the immersion of ethanol towards the membrane is suggested to reduce the density of otc attached to the membrane surface or inner layer and bonded with the hydroxyl group oh in ethanol the otc molecules might absorb enough kinetic energy for them to break and form new bonds with ethanol the efficiency of ethanol was proved by tian and co workers in the comparison between sodium hydroxide naoh and ethanol for the cleaning process ethanol cleaning significantly removed the foulant layer compared to naoh cleaning 90 moreover during water permeation of the cleaned membrane the water vapor that continuously moved through the membrane could weaken the hydrogen bonding of remained otc molecules small amount and slowly removed the molecules from the membrane 95 therefore the removal efficiency of otc improved the flux recovery and increased the frr percentage as discussed in the previous paragraph overall the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane showed a significant improvement in membrane performances particularly flux recovery hence this phnt0 5 5 250 membrane was further investigated for regeneration and long term performances regeneration of phnt0 5 5 250 membrane was evaluated for flux permeability otc removal normalized flux and flux recovery with fouling rate after each cycle until the 5th cycle of md operation process each cycle consisting of a 6 h permeation process followed by ethanol cleaning as shown in fig 15 in fig 15a the average flux of phnt0 5 5 250 membrane 6 53 l m2h has slowly decreased to 4 21 l m2h this membrane still can be regenerated over 60 after 5th cycle of the md operation process the reduction of flux permeation could be due to the aromatic rings of otc molecules that interacted with the membrane surface and might require longer cleaning process to increase the regeneration percentage this statement was clarified in previous study using dye molecules which also consisted of aromatic rings in their structure and caused pore blocking hence reduced the vapor permeate flux 96 however the otc removal has maintained 99 for each cycle which proved the ability of this membrane in removing this antibiotic molecule the error bars in fig 15b had significantly proved the high consistency of otc removal for each cycle after duplication in fig 15c the normalized flux of each cycle was evaluated to identify the stability of the flux permeation at each minute a descending trend with minimum ratio value of j jo by 0 63 after the 5th cycle was obtained which corresponded to the flux regeneration percentage as mentioned above below 750 min the permeability of this membrane was significantly inconsistence the water vapor permeation of each minutes obtained higher flux permeation than initial flux and increased up to 1 58 of j jo ratio at certain minute meanwhile above 750 min permeation the flux seemed to show a more stable flux permeability the cleaning process of each cycle might disturb the wetting resistance of this membrane and lead to flux reduction after 5th cycle of membrane regeneration furthermore the calculated flux recovery at different cycle achieved 84 3rd cycle with fouling rate not 31 after ongoing the 5th cycle these results demonstrated that the hnt loadings in pvdf membrane not only played the role as pore forming agent but also as surface modifier to remove otc due to its natural ability 97 phnt0 5 5 250 membrane seems to behave better in long term operation compared to regeneration process of every 6 h permeation water and otc separation long term operation for phnt0 5 5 250 membrane shows a very stable flux permeation after 24 h of otc separation process fig 16a presents the permeate flux of otc solution with normalized flux ratio the consistency of the membrane flux was significantly observed and proved by the normalized flux ratio value which almost closed to 1 00 the long term operation of this membrane not only achieved higher and consistence flux permeation yet it also assisted a complete rejection of otc molecules 100 as shown in fig 10b moreover the prepared membrane has achieved 100 frr which can be due to the wetting resistance properties such as lep and ca that meet the requirement of md membrane the desired wetting resistance characteristics can prevent severe adsorption of the charged antibiotic molecules on the surface of the membrane and produce better antifouling properties 98 the antifouling properties have proved by the low fouling rate frr tfdr and ifdr values which is 10 after 24 h of long term operation process overall the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane has significantly achieved the desired md membrane and improved its performances with better antifouling properties 4 conclusion efficient performance of the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane for the removal of otc antibiotic was obtained using optimal immersion time of 5 s and nominal thickness of 250 μm for the development of new hydrophobic md membrane the introduction of hnt in the hydrophobic pvdf membrane was successfully implemented to improve the characteristics and the performances of the pristine membrane for md application this membrane was compared using 5 s and 15 s of immersion time then improved by 100 μm and 250 μm respectively the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane was evaluated based on the improvement of flux permeation with acceptable otc removal this membrane not only shows a significant improvement in membrane performances but it also obtains the desired wetting characteristics of ca lep porosity as well as pore formation the experimental findings proved that the reduction of membrane thickness using 250 μm could increase the membrane flux about 38 4 however lower thickness 100 μm had reduced the endurance of prepared membrane the excellent interfacial adhesion of 0 5 of hnt particles in the pvdf membrane using 20 c coagulation bath temperature formed better pore formation after introducing low immersion time with less membrane thickness therefore the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane was selected for further investigation on membrane reversibility including regeneration and long term operation the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane was successfully obtained high flux recovery for both operation processes with low fouling rate particularly for long term operation the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane was able to remove up to 98 of otc molecules from the feed solution the regeneration and long operation on the other hand facilitated a 99 9 100 otc removal in conclusion the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane is an alternative hydrophobic membrane for removing otc molecules via dcmd which can be further improved for superhydrophobic surface layer hence assisted higher membrane permeability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

12804,halloysite nanotube hnt was incorporated in poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane to remove contaminants of emerging concern cec known as oxytetracycline otc which is extensively used in the aquaculture industry the presence of hnt in the pvdf matrix has improved the characteristics and separation of the pristine membrane this study evaluated the effectiveness of low concentration of hnt loading for treating otc molecules via direct contact membrane distillation dcmd which produced high flux recovery after ethanol cleaning the performance of pvdf hnt phnt membrane with 0 5 hnt loading was compared using immersion time of 5 and 15 s further improvement was carried out by reducing 500 μm of the membrane thickness to 250 and 100 μm the wetting characteristics were determined to achieve the desired properties of dcmd membrane and gain insights into the antifouling mechanism of phnt membrane the modified membrane using 5 s immersion time obtained a high liquid entry pressure and contact angle ca of 2 13 bar 0 34 and 140 3 10 respectively this membrane had removed 95 of otc molecules with a permeate flux of 5 52 l m2h a 38 4 increment in flux permeation with 98 removal was obtained after reducing the membrane thickness to 250 μm 7 64 l m2h the total and irreversible flux decline of this membrane was significantly low as a result the flux recovery obtained above 90 after ethanol cleaning including for membrane regeneration and long term operation investigation otc removal from the feed solution improved from 98 to 100 after the regeneration and long term operation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hnt immersion time and thickness oxytetracycline flux recovery dcmd 1 introduction recently the rapid animal production to support food security has created serious environmental issues such as release of pharmaceutical contaminants particularly antibiotics due to their excessive use as growth promoter and medicine to animal infection 1 2 antibiotics exhibit only 30 absorption in the digestive tract while the excesses are released into the water ecosystem via the body excretions 3 in some rural area the direct discharge of contaminated wastewater sludge with antibiotics to the aquatic environment and at household level has become a serious issue 4 meanwhile the conventional water treatment plants have limited capability to eliminate antibiotics from livestock and aquaculture wastewater low concentrations of antibiotics are detected up to μg l levels in surface water seawater groundwater and even drinking water have proved the persistence of antibiotics in the ecosystem 5 the world health organization who has made a similar remark about the increasing detection of trace levels of pharmaceuticals e g otc in drinking water surface water and groundwater most of which are 1 μg l meanwhile wastewater treatment effluents or wastewater discharge from poorly managed manufacturing sites contains higher concentrations of these pollutants 6 therefore this issue has attracted a great concern as it might build up a resistance ecosystem towards pathogenic organisms eliminating antibiotics from the water ecosystem has become a global imperative among the commonly used antibiotics oxytetracyclines otc from tetracycline group are one of the established veterinary drugs the high demand of otc in livestock industry is due to its ability to resist both gram positive and gram negative bacteria particularly to control the intestinal and respiratory infections 7 in term of chemical structure the existing of four fused benzene rings with multiple functional groups such as amide hydroxyl and tertiary amino groups provide the hydrophilic characteristics of otc molecules 8 the speciation of otc molecules occurs according to ph values which indirectly influences the chemistry of the feed solution resulting in transformation products and exhibits half life time within 6 h to 9 days e g in aquatic environments 9 10 previous studies have also reported that otc residue concentrations in the livestock industry are still range from 0 006 to 136 mg l 11 12 therefore several treatment processes have been implemented to remove otc molecules from water streams such as photocatalysis 13 15 adsorption 8 16 17 and recently membrane distillation md 18 19 from these studies some of them have applied intermediate otc concentrations range within 10 to 25 mg l via adsorption and md treatment processes 8 19 findings report that the introduction of hnt was successfully reduced the otc concentration in the feed solutions hnt is similar to kaolinite but it has an advance morphology of multiwalled nanotubular shaped crystal configuration which provides a high specific surface area to the hnt structure 20 21 the nanotube shaped of hnt is formed by the rolling of aluminosilicate layers due to the mismatch in consistency of sharing oxygen atoms between inner aluminium al and outer silica si and exhibit positive internal aluminol al oh and negative external siloxane si o si surfaces 22 current research has also shown that both covalent 23 24 and supramolecular or electrostatic interactions can be used to selectively modify hnt surfaces in terms of covalent modifications grafting organosilanes onto the outer surface of hnts enabled the development of effective supported catalysts for methyl methacrylate polymerization 25 on the other hand inorganic micelles capable of entrapping hydrophobic molecules were obtained by attaching octadecylphosphonic acid 26 and dopamine derivatives 25 27 to the alumina groups of the internal hnt surface moreover electrostatic interactions between hnts surfaces and amphiphilic molecules surfactants 28 30 polymers 31 32 or enzymes 33 can produce functionalized hnt with specific properties the interactions of hnt positive lumen and the head group of anionic surfactants e g sodium alkanoates 30 34 35 sodium perfluoroalkanoates 28 sodium dodecylsulfate 30 resulted in modified hnt with a hydrophobic lumen study reported that introducing an anionic surfactant to the interior surface of hnt enhanced their net negative charge increasing electrostatic repulsions and thereby dispersion stability 36 it was proved that mixing hnts with anionic surfactants yielded pickering emulsions for oil spill remediation 37 38 for instance sodium alkanoates hnts hybrids can be applied for bioremediation due to their capacity to capture aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons from aqueous and gas phases 35 the functionalized hnt can act as removal agents for decontamination purposes due to their ability to entrap aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons inside their hydrophobically modified lumen 35 the usage of hnt based micellar systems has a variety of benefits including a lower amount of organic surfactant which is far below its critical micellar concentration and a near zero concentration of free surfactant molecules the hydrophobic lumen permits encapsulation of neutral and hydrophobic molecules while the solid polar shell offers stability for hnt dispersion in water and retention of encapsulated molecules 39 these appealing systems allow for a variety of applications including drug immobilization 40 and water purification 35 hence hnt and its composites have been applied in several treatments such as ultrafiltration membrane for bovine serum albumin bsa separation 21 membrane pervaporation for the separation of n butanol aqueous solution 41 adsorption 8 and md membrane 19 for otc removal however incorporation of hnt in polymer membrane modification has received limited attention mainly in md membrane development md process requires high wetting resistance properties to maintain performance efficiency including surface hydrophobicity liquid entry pressure lep and morphology these properties of md membrane assist the thermally driven separation process in which only water vapor can pass through the membrane pores as permeate even though md has been widely established for desalination process it is also a potential process for otc non volatile compound separation as only volatile molecules can penetrate the pores moreover the hydrophilic characteristic of otc will eventually assist its removal due to the hydrophobic interaction occurs during md process the otc removal can be further improved by the introduction of functional groups on the hydrophobic md membrane surface using filler incorporation apart from nanoparticles nano clays like hnt are selected as an alternative filler in md membrane fabrication therefore the interaction mechanism between hnt and pvdf as well as otc separation mechanism have been illustrated in our previous study 19 however fabrication parameters of prepared membrane not only involve the modification of hnt in pvdf matrix but also includes the immersion time and membrane thickness investigation for the improvement of membrane permeability a study by syawaliah and team presented the effect of immersion time for ultrafiltration membrane they found that the duration of immersion time was significantly affect the characteristics and performances of the prepared membranes 42 the effect of immersion time on the membrane structure is highly dependent on the system components and concentrations during phase demixing process 43 a high affinity between non solvent and polymer induces slower precipitation with delayed demixing process liquid liquid phase separation thus a more symmetric structure is formed sukitpaneenit and co worker reported that the increasingly weak non solvent could lead to the formation of interconnected globular structure with the presence of spherical globules from the semi crystalline pvdf 44 consequently it increased the fragility of the membrane therefore an alternative of using weak non solvent such as ethanol and methanol is proposed a study investigated the precipitation rate of pvdf membrane during demixing process using methanol and ethanol as coagulation bath was performed the immersion precipitation rate was influenced differently by different alcohol based non solvents in altering the formation of pore for membrane morphology they discovered that using methanol and ethanol as coagulation bath had changed the solution solid liquid demixing profile that gave different polymer morphology crystallinity and structural stability 45 furthermore there are limited findings reported on the optimal membrane thickness regarding md membrane specifically for direct contact membrane distillation dcmd 46 47 the membrane thickness is significantly influenced the performance of the prepared membrane in md process the application of thin membrane for pure water shows high flux along the md operation however eykens and team reported that a high feed concentration e g high salinity could severely reduce the flux and energy efficiency when using thin membranes which could only be implemented if there was sufficient driving force 47 this statement emphasized that the feed concentration highly influenced the water vapor permeation as the operation process involved thermal conductivity bulk temperature difference and flow velocity for the separation process to work efficiently therefore a limited study on fabrication parameters for md membrane has attracted our attention to perform further experimental investigation in this study non solvent induced phase separation nips was applied for the formation of hydrophobic pvdf hnt membrane by dual immersion process methanol and water nips was chosen because the rate of pvdf crystallization during the liquid liquid demixing process had a substantial effect on the structure of the prepared membrane 43 nips also generates diverse structure high selectivity and only required low operation temperature 48 therefore the objectives of this work are to investigate the effects of fabrication parameters immersion time membrane thickness and coagulation bath temperature on membrane permeability selectivity and antifouling properties of the developed hydrophobic pvdf hnt membrane the evaluation of flux recovery on the selected membranes was conducted to determine the reusability of potential membrane after five cycle of membrane regeneration and long term operation processes this study is a step forward for more investigation oriented approach in developing an md membrane that meets industrial requirements 2 experimental 2 1 materials pvdf solef 6010 1001 powder was purchased from solvay solexis france non toxic triethyl phosphate tep methanol absolute ethanol for analysis were acquired from merck darmstadt germany hnt filler with diameter of 30 70 nm and length of 1 3 μm was supplied by sigma aldrich this filler has specific surface area of 50 150 m2 g and achieves its stability up to 460 c due to the de hydroxylation oxytetracycline hydrochloride mw 496 89 g mol λmax 275 nm molecular formula c22h24n2o9 hcl cas 2058 46 0 was obtained from nano life quest sdn bhd in powder form and classified in the cec group of antibiotics distilled water was used in the second coagulation bath during immersion precipitation 2 2 preparation of phnt membranes via immersion precipitation the preparation method of phnt0 5 membrane was successfully implemented in our previous study for otc removal 19 therefore in this study the previous method was further applied to investigate the applicable immersion time and membrane thickness for the improvement of flux permeation the result of otc removal flux permeability and wetting characteristics of 0 5 hnt loading showed a high potential to be modified for better membrane permeation further experiment was carried out to improve membrane permeation by reducing the immersion time in pure methanol from 15 min to 15 s and 5 s the modified 0 5 hnt membrane by 5 s immersion time was compared with the wetting characteristics and membrane permeability of modified membrane using different nominal thickness of 250 and 100 μm respectively the nominal thickness was defined as the gap of the casting knife before the casting process whereas the actual thickness was measured with a scanning electron microscope sem finally the membrane with 250 μm thickness setting was further investigated for different water coagulation bath temperatures table 1 shows the preparation of the phnt membranes for 0 5 concentration 2 3 membrane characterization membrane distillation requires several criteria of anti wetting properties to ensure an efficient distillation process contact angle ca is a measurement of water repellent properties for membrane surfaces the ca was calculated by the sessile drop technique of a goniometer rame hart 250 f 1 usa approximately 6 μl of a water droplet was set up on the membrane surface and the reading was recorded this step was repeated in several areas to measure the consistency of the hydrophobic angle between droplets and surfaces due to the immersion in pure methanol the ca of all membranes was expected to exceed 90 other than ca liquid entry pressure lep and pore size are considered important factors for separation and permeation processes specifically direct contact membrane distillation dcmd i e the simplest configuration both factors were determined using a porolux 1000 porometer benelux scientific belgium for lep water was used as a high surface tension liquid 72 dynes cm to avoid direct absorption of water in the pores the lep reading was measured by the first bubble point after nitrogen n2 flowed meanwhile the pore size of the prepared membrane was examined using a membrane with 20 mm diameter after immersion in porefil 16 0 dynes cm low surface tension liquid for 1 h the pore size measurement was obtained after the wet and dry curves were recorded the porosity of the prepared membrane is one of the consequences of the membrane permeation rate behavior the prepared membranes of 1 cm 1 cm were immersed in porefil for 1 h then the mass of wet membranes m1 was recorded and dried at 70 c in an oven for 24 h and the mass of dry membranes m2 was obtained all the details were used for porosity ɛ calculation using eq 1 1 ε m 1 m 2 ρ 1 m 1 m 2 ρ 1 m 2 ρ 2 x 100 where ρ1 and ρ2 are the wetting liquid density porefil 1 87 g m3 and polymer density pvdf 1 78 g m3 respectively tensile strength and elongation at break of the prepared membranes were determined by an instron testing machine model 3366 norwood ma usa with the pulling rate of 0 5 mm s the membranes were prepared according to astm d882 standards which is suitable for sample with a thickness of 1 mm the elastic modulus of prepared membranes was evaluated by the stress strain curve the surface and cross section structures of the prepared membranes were examined using a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi tm3000 tabletop microscope hitachi ltd japan at magnifications of 500 and 2 0kx the energy of beam was set to 5 kv 15 kv or analy mode with working distance of 0 5 1 5 mm according to the sample conditions during the analysis the surface pore size sps was manually measured to compare the formation of surface pores after introducing to different parameters modifications e g immersion time membrane thickness and coagulation bath temperature including the actual membrane thickness the cross section structures were characterized after the samples fractured in n2 and gold coated to obtain more clear images surface roughness of selected membranes was analyzed using atomic force microscopy afm ultraobjective the samples were measured at a scan size of 10 μm 10 μm the nanoscope analysis software was used to measure the mean roughness ra of the scanned area fourier transform infrared spectroscopic ftir thermo scientific nicolet nexus 670 was used to determine the functional group of the hnt powder and the membrane with the presence of hnt the transmittance bands of the selected membranes were performed in the range of 500 cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 2 4 dcmd performance for permeability and otc removal this study applied the simplest md configuration dcmd as an alternative separation process to remove low otc concentration 10 ppm in aqueous solution a laboratory scale of dcmd setup is shown in fig 1 with an effective membrane area of 47 5 cm2 the temperature of the feed and permeate solutions were set and fixed as in our previous study 19 for all the prepared membranes of different fabrication parameters throughout the process the flow rates at both hot and cold sides were constantly maintained to 252 36 ml min one litre of otc solution feed was continuously operated for 3 h after flowing with distilled water 3 h a selected phnt0 5 membrane was then carried out for regeneration and long term operation study the regeneration study was performed until 5 cycle operation by 3 h of each otc separation process whereas 24 h was required to complete the long term operation study the mass of permeate solution was weighed with an electronic balance connected to a computer for every 60 s interval the otc rejection was determined by the calculation of the concentration of feed and permeate solutions which were analyzed using an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer cary 60 uv vis agilent technologies two equations were applied to calculate the

transfer across the membrane temperature polarization coefficient tpc is the function of boundary layer resistance on both feed and permeate side of the membrane it indicates the efficiency of the md process the tpc decline is primarily in the range of 0 4 tpc 0 7 49 when the process is limited by mass transfer it approaches unity for the well proposed system the high heat resistance of boundary layers causes the tpc to approach zero in a poorly built system as a result this process is limited by heat transfer 50 4 tpc t fm t pm t fb t pb where tfb and tpb are the bulk temperatures at feed and permeate sides tfm and tpm are the temperatures of the liquid vapor interface at the membrane surface pores of the feed and permeate sides respectively the relation between mass and heat transfer

modified membranes for different immersion times and thickness setting were further tested for flux recovery after each cycle of treatment these membranes were immersed in ethanol and left in a shaker

recovery after cleaning the flux recovery ratio frr fouling reduction rate frr total flux decline ratio tfdr irreversible flux decline ratio ifdr and normalized flux were calculated for all modified

flux nf was calculated to evaluate the antifouling properties of the modified membranes 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fabrication parameters on the membrane characteristics pvdf membrane morphology after direct water immersion was compared to pvdf membrane morphology after a dual immersion method methanol and water to determine which should be modified further methanol was selected in this study because it precipitated faster than ethanol during the delay demixing process which facilitated the formation of larger pores size of the prepared membrane 45 and enhanced the wetting resistance properties e g ca and lep compared to direct water immersion 51 fig 2 shows the characteristics and real samples of both membranes the pristine membrane by direct water immersion has formed a thinner membrane layer with symmetric structure compared to the dual immersion process even though the membrane formed symmetric structure the ca value was 90 indicating as hydrophilic surface in fact the phase inversion of direct water immersion should result in faster demixing and formed finger like structure which is opposite with the result shown in fig 2a this could be owing to the use of tep solvent which caused the formation of sponge like structure particularly at high pvdf concentration 18 wt tep is a weaker solvent for the polymer than typical hazard solvent and tends to promote large spherulites even when a harsh bath e g water is used due to the crystallization phenomenon 52 the pvdf polymer chains curled more in tep which could be due to the higher steric encumbrance and slightly weaker interactions with polymer chains moreover kinetic studies by previous research reported that water passed more slower in the tep solution than n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp resulting in a slower solvent non solvent exchange rate during phase inversion 53 in general a high polymer concentration raises the viscosity of the polymer solution and slows tep water exchange resulting in a spongy matrix with a narrow porous surface moreover the formation of different types of membrane structure was related to the types of solvent and non solvent used which have an important role in the delay demixing process therefore the purpose of dual coagulation bath is to induce the early onset of solid liquid demixing that could enhance the pvdf crystallization in alpha phase 54 the less affinity between polymer solvent resulted in a lower precipitation rate of polymer via the formation of sponge like structures the lower water absorption capacity of dual coagulation bath proving the higher hydrophobicity than the direct water immersion membrane that showed by ca measurements 55 moreover methanol has high tendency to reduce pore collapsing compared to water due to its lower surface tension property which indirectly maintained the formation of membrane pore size during drying process 56 as a result the process led to the different surface structure and thickness layer of the prepared membranes introducing methanol as a pre coagulant bath improved the membrane structure of the pristine pvdf membrane and resulted in a hydrophobic ca range 90 with a larger pore size fig 2c from this comparison it shows that tep solvent tend to induce slower exchange rate due to its chemical properties and thus forming symmetric structure due to the improvement after using methanol during the casting process further pvdf membrane modification on the fabrication parameters was carried out by the dual immersion process the scanning electron microscopy sem images of the of phnt0 5 membranes for different immersion time and membrane thickness are shown in fig 3 all membranes formed identical surface and cross sectional morphologies the alteration of sps upon the reduction of immersion time and thickness setting was shown in fig 3 a c e g i and fig 3 b d f h j respectively the immersion time during coagulation process influenced the sps and thickness of phnt0 5 membranes the formation of a sponge like structure in the membrane support layer was induced by the contact time between the cast solution with the pure methanol during casting process which facilitated the anti wettability of the inner layer the anti wettability of the inner layer could be identified by the measurement of liquid entry pressure lep this parameter measures the resistance of high surface tension liquid e g water from immediate penetration into the membrane pores by introducing an external pressure of n2 a low lep value indicates the less wetting resistance of the inner layer of the prepared membrane the minimum practical lep value for md is 1 bar and the value should not exceed 3 bars as it will affect membrane permeability this wetting parameter may be affected by the alteration of sps porosity thickness and pore shape finger like or sponge like structure 57 58 in fig 3 the reduction of immersion time to 15 s 1 83 0 01 μm and 5 s 2 50 0 12 μm obtained greater sps compared to 15 min 1 64 0 10 μm reducing the immersion time has increased 20 of the membrane thickness from 238 μm to 262 μm phnt0 5 15 and 264 μm phnt0 5 5 respectively this result was due to the desolvation of solvent into the coagulation bath which influenced the formation of membrane layer a dense layer forms when solvent in the casting solution desolvates before the coagulant medium diffuses into the casting solution whereas the porous layer forms when the coagulant medium diffuses into the casting solution before the desolvation of solvent occurs 55 therefore the less contact time of casting solution with first coagulant bath methanol had enlarged the pore size during immersion process due to the enhancement of delay solvent non solvent exchange rate with water as second coagulant bath hence led to a thicker and symmetric membrane layer this statement is consistent with the results obtained in fig 3 c d and e f in which lower immersion time 5 s increased sps value with higher membrane thickness further investigation on thickness setting of 5 s immersion time was carried out to obtain a thinner membrane layer which is more applicable to be applied for md process the nominal thickness of 250 μm and 100 μm decreased to the actual membrane thickness of 134 μm and 71 μm respectively as shown in sem images the difference between the actual thickness and the nominal thickness was due to the solvent evaporation and polymer molecular structure rearrangement during the drying process a rapid solvent evaporation resulted in faster polymer deposition speed as less layers were involved in the membrane formation 59 60 therefore a difference value of the membrane thickness layer was obtained after the formation of a dried solid membrane meanwhile the sps values was increased up to 2 67 0 38 μm and 2 54 0 18 μm for phnt0 5 5 250 and phnt0 5 5 100 membranes kusworo et al 2017 reported in their study that the lower immersion time could increase the pore size of the membrane 61 relatively the application of 5 s of immersion time with less nominal thickness indirectly enhanced the delay exchange rate of solvent non solvent hence it formed thin membrane layer with larger sps and improved the membrane permeability which will be elaborated in the next section the incorporation of hnt in the pvdf matrix significantly affects the mechanical stability of the resultant pvdf hnt membranes as shown in fig 4 the presence of 0 5 hnt in the pvdf matrix phnt0 5 has lowered the tensile strength to 1 04 mpa with maximum elongation at break of 36 75 and elastic modulus of 44 24 mpa compared to the pristine membrane this could be due to a decrease in pvdf content in the membrane matrix as well as strong interactions between polymer chains and hnt which reduced molecule movement 62 moreover zou et al 2022 reported that membrane with lower pvdf concentrations have poorer tensile strength than those with greater concentrations 63 thus the mechanical stability of the phnt0 5 membrane was lower however the modification on different immersion time at constant nominal thickness did not highly affect the mechanical stability of the pvdf hnt membranes the shorter immersion time in methanol produced larger sps refer fig 3a c e that seemed to slightly reduce the tensile strength of the membrane phnt0 5 5 refer fig 4a this demonstrates that when stress is applied to the phnt0 5 5 membrane it deforms quickly the applied stress may cause particular sections of the membrane to crack resulting in decreased tensile strength meanwhile the slightly higher elastic modulus of the phnt0 5 5 membrane could be owing to a transient increase in applied stress at a specific location before it completely breaks altering the elastic modulus value as shown in fig 4b this could be related with the formation of larger pore size and the porosity of the prepared membrane that influenced the differential force acting on it refer fig 3 and table 2 moreover phnt0 5 5 250 membrane with nominal thickness of 250 μm demonstrated exceptional mechanical stability than 500 μm with a tensile strength of 1 07 mpa a maximum elongation of 94 05 and an elastic modulus of 49 30 mpa the least stress was applied to this membrane resulting in a higher strain and visible deformation consequently the elongation at break and tensile strength of this membrane were increased compared to other pvdf hnt membranes this was indicated as a result of the well distributed hnt particles during the casting process which aided mechanical stability at lower thickness layers in addition hnt can aid inter chain sliding resulting in a high elongation value 64 the most significant wetting resistance properties of md membranes are defined by surface hydrophobicity and membrane wettability these properties were evaluated by the lep and ca measurements as shown in fig 5 as mentioned in the previous paragraph lep is a crucial parameter to maintain the wettability of the prepared membranes particularly for long term operation even though 1 bar of lep is applicable for md operation the wettability of the prepared membrane could slowly decline once it is utilized therefore in this study the lep of all prepared membranes was duplicated and successfully achieved 1 5 bar this outcome was expected to assist the wettability of these membranes after repeated cycles of otc separation hence maintaining the rejection percentage from the graph fig 5a the reduction of immersion time to 5 s obtained the highest ca of 140 3 10 with lep of 2 13 bar 0 34 the results of prepared membranes showed an ascending trend of ca while descending trend not 1 5 bar obtained by lep the formation of larger pores has significantly affected the reduction of lep and their relation was reported in a study by mcgaughey et al 2020 65 a less dense surface structure of phnt0 5 5 membrane was formed due to the formation of thin entangling string like structure fig 3e which improved the surface roughness and increased the pores size compared to denser sponge like structure of phnt0 5 membrane fig 3a thus lower immersion time during casting process has significantly increased the ca but decreased the lep of the prepared membrane the implementation of less thickness setting of 250 μm and 100 μm using the similar formulation of phnt0 5 5 membrane obtained a different trend but it still in the range of wetting characteristic requirements the result in fig 5b shows that decreasing the thickness setting could decrease both ca and lep of the prepared membranes the ca of phnt0 5 5 membranes using 250 μm phnt0 5 5 250 and 100 μm phnt0 5 5 100 has reduced to 131 2 52 and 132 0 03 respectively even though the lep values have decreased to 1 65 bar 0 13 and 1 74 bar 0 01 both are still applicable for further investigation in this study as it met the required range for md application this consequence was suggested due to the enlargement of membrane pore size the thinner membrane could facilitate a faster exchange rate between solvent and non solvent during immersion process and eventually led to the formation of larger pore size it happened due to the less polymer solution volume during the immersion process a lesser amount of concentrated polymer solution was thermodynamically more stable and accelerated kinetics due to less thick layer markedly reduced the time for the membrane to precipitate 66 hence increased pore size and reduced wetting characteristics of the prepared membranes the investigation on the fabrication parameters of prepared membranes was significantly altered the membrane characteristics the prepared pvdf hnt membranes attained a porous membrane structure with high porosity of 85 92 as shown in table 2 however the phnt0 5 15 membrane obtained the lowest porosity among the prepared membranes a higher error bar value of this membrane porosity 85 1 39 indicates the possibility of low interfacial adhesion of hnt loading on pvdf matrix at 15 s of immersion time the formation of uneven pores within the membrane areas led to the large different porosity and thus increased the error bar meanwhile the porosity of phnt0 5 5 membrane has maintained its porous structure and formed more stable pores due to the lower error bar value 86 0 11 compared to phnt0 5 86 0 20 and phnt0 5 15 membranes further investigation on phnt0 5 5 membrane showed a different result on membrane porosity the low thickness setting was significantly increased the membrane porosity to 90 92 respectively the lower thickness 250 and 100 μm and shorter duration of immersion process 5 s in methanol have influenced a higher rate of demixing process of polymer solution compared to 500 μm and 15 min which tend to form larger membrane pores the formation of larger sps in fig 3g and i is consistence to the result obtained by the percentages porosity moreover the surface roughness of selected membranes was characterized to study the impact of hnt presence in the pvdf matrix on the physicochemical properties of membranes from the ca result the addition of hnt in the pvdf matrix was significantly improved this result was consistence with the 3d afm surface graphs of pristine pvdf and phnt0 5 5 250 membranes as shown in fig 6 the pristine membrane allowed the membrane to have surface roughness with a ra value of 165 nm fig 6a after the incorporation of hnt in the membrane matrix the surface roughness become more prominent with ra values of 189 nm fig 6b this was due to the increment of hnt particles in the pvdf matrix which led to the formation of large nodular morphology area as well as dual coagulation bath that induced lower surface energy 67 hence it improved wetting resistance due to its higher surface tension with water meanwhile membrane porosity was found to increase with the membrane average pore size as tabulated in table 3 which eventually improved the membrane performance as discussed in section 3 2 from this study the properties of this pvdf hnt membrane have met the requirements of membrane characteristics for md application the characteristics results of prepared membranes were indirectly influenced by the nature of hnt as mentioned earlier the nanotubular structure of hnt facilitates a well dispersion in the pvdf matrix due to the presence of inner surface of al oh group while the outer layer has been covered by si oh group the presence of both groups was allocated around 902 cm 1 and 989 cm 1 by ftir analysis respectively naturally hnt is one of hydrophilic fillers that contained abundant of oh group due to the availability of si oh on the outer layer the oh bands were indicated by two identical wavenumbers at 3619 cm 1 and 3624 cm 1 as shown in fig 7a 68 however the blending of hnt in pvdf matrix has caused the absence of oh bands present in hnt as observed in fig 7b simultaneously it induced the shifting of cf band by the hydrogen bonding interaction between al oh groups and fluorine of pvdf chains with reduction of band intensity at 773 cm 1 meanwhile the linkage of si oh groups onto the pvdf chain was shifted to 1175 cm 1 with lower intensity compared to the band of pvdf membrane the absence of hydroxyl groups in pvdf hnt chains might be due to the exchange of hydroxyl group in methanol with unbonded hydrogen existed on pvdf hnt chains during phase inversion process consequently this interaction influenced higher hydrophobicity and surface roughness of the prepared membranes further investigation was carried out on the time evolution of ca after the deposition on the membrane surface to quantify their permeability to liquid water fig 8 shows the permeability of the liquid water droplet into the matrix which summarized the variation of ca within 3600 s from the graph different fabrication parameters after the addition of hnt not only improved the ca but the water droplet was insignificantly changed within 120 s spreading and absorption are two main effects that influence the droplet evolution therefore from the graph all the prepared membranes were attributed to experience absorption rather than spreading due to the ca values 90 however the wetting behaviors of hydrophobic membrane surface are similar to hydrophilic surface but with a slower absorption rate at the early stage which forms a shoulder region once the water droplet in contact with the surface 69 this statement consistence with the pristine membrane that observed to slightly decrease after 120 s due to less hydrophobic surface the lowest ca value compared to other modified membranes the absorption phenomena that occurred on the membrane surfaces might be affected by the impact velocity wettability and surface morphology 70 71 due to the test conducted at a height of 0 m the impact velocity was insignificant in this study however in term of wettability the prepared membranes obtained different surface wettability after 3600 s of droplet deposition wenzel claims that high surface roughness amplifies both wetting and liquid repellence 72 surface roughness promotes wetting if ca 90 and it increases liquid repellence if ca 90 as long as the pore size of the surface morphology is considerably lower than the water droplet size 73 75 moreover the surface tension on drop spreading between 50mnm 1 and 73mnm 1 e g water has been investigated to have only minor effect to the water absorption 76 hence the droplet evolution of prepared membranes was decreased depending on the obtained ca due to the formation of different surface roughness and sps value furthermore the formation of isotropic porous structure of all prepared membranes generated the similar trend of the water droplet evolution however in md process the dynamic behavior of droplet absorption using md simulation has no air trapping in the pores due to the absence of air 77 the impact velocity could increase the contact diameter of the droplet which indicated that the absorption time is smaller than the retraction time with consideration of kinetic energy to surface energy and volume conservation the absorption process is determined by the pore size and inertia and indirectly facilitates the permeability and selectivity of the md process 3 2 effect of fabrication parameters on the performance of phnt0 5 membranes the crucial factors of the prepared membranes are their permeability and selectivity in this study the aim of the prepared membranes is to treat the antibiotic found in livestock and aquaculture wastewaters specifically otc and simultaneously obtain good water vapor permeability therefore fig 9a presents the membrane permeability and fig 9b shows the otc removal using the prepared phnt0 5 membranes before and after modification among the prepared membranes phnt0 5 5 100 membrane could not be further tested for its performances due to a sudden rupture red circle after 1 h of permeation test as shown in fig 9c the phnt0 5 membrane was further investigated to improve flux permeation by immersing the cast dope solution at different immersion times of pre non solvent prior to the water bath in comparison 5 s of immersion time for the phnt0 5 5 membrane showed an improvement in flux permeation when the contact time of cast dope solution with methanol was reduced refer to fig 9 the average permeate flux improved up to 5 52 l m2h which is about 10 improvement compared to 15 min of immersion time 4 97 l m2h however a different outcome was obtained after immersing the cast phnt0 5 solution for 15 s the average permeate flux decreased insignificantly to 4 85 l m2h due to the later flux stability after 1 h operation consequently a longer immersion time could lead to the formation of an over dense bottom layer while reducing the flux permeation 78 moreover the longer immersion time 15 s would form a closer surface structure with an sps value of 1 83 μm 0 01 whereas the immersion time of 5 s improved the sps up to 2 50 μm 0 17 as shown in fig 10 a previous study reported that the formation of pores and interconnectivity within the membrane structure would also affect by the temperature of the coagulation bath thereby influencing the rate of polymer precipitation and the exchange rate between non solvent and solvent of polymer solution 79 for this study the illustration of formation of a dense bottom layer is proposed in fig 10 the figure explains that during immersion precipitation methanol molecules non solvent diffused deep inside the cast dope solution and solidified pvdf hnt chains around them simultaneously the molecules tend to move the nearby pvdf hnt chains towards the glass plate due to the poor affinity between them the slow diffusion rate of the non solvent at longer immersion time using pure methanol solution inhibited the pvdf hnt chains from being immediately solidified and moved to the bottom as a result more area of pvdf hnt chains gathered at the interface between the cast dope solution and the glass plate therefore the phnt0 5 15 membrane formed a denser inner layer compared to the loose inner layer of phnt0 5 5 membrane with well distribution of pvdf hnt chain refer to fig 10 this hypothesis is relevant to the formation of the membrane thickness and sps values of phnt0 5 15 min of immersion precipitation and the phnt0 5 15 15 s of immersion precipitation membranes as shown in fig 3b and d hence from this study the optimal membrane for the effect of immersion time was obtained by immersing the membrane in methanol for 5 s and then in water for another 24 h the optimal immersion time of pre coagulation bath methanol was applied for the different thickness investigation on the phnt0 5 5 membrane due to the sudden rupture of phnt0 5 5 100 membrane during performance test only phnt0 5 5 250 membrane was compared for its performances with other prepared membranes an improvement was obtained in otc permeate flux for phnt0 5 5 250 membrane the membrane flux has increased up to 7 64 l m2h for 3 h permeation test which is almost 30 improvement in membrane permeability however the fluctuating flux values in fig 9a might be due to the water vapor pressure change along the md process which predominantly dependent on heat loss from the feed temperature 80 in comparison with previous study the flux rate of the prepared membrane is almost similar as it obtained the same range of surface roughness 81 they found that higher surface roughness had improved the flux rate of the prepared membrane thus due to a slight increase of surface roughness for phnt0 5 5 250 membrane than the pristine fig 6b it still showed some improvement in flux permeation with better otc removal 98 rejection overall a nominal thickness of 250 μm produced the best thickness for the prepared phnt0 5 5 membrane 5 s of immersion time these results are agreed with the membrane characterization as described in the previous section particularly sps value 2 67 0 38 μm and porosity percentage 90 the characterization of this membrane facilitated a higher permeation rate of water vapor passing through the pores hence a higher flux permeation was obtained additionally different coagulation bath temperatures were investigated to determine the characteristics and performance of the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane for former fabrication parameters all the prepared membranes were constantly immersed in coagulation bath at 20 21 c after casting process therefore 10 c and 50 c of coagulation bath temperatures were selected to investigate the effect of different casting conditions on the performances of optimal phnt0 5 5 250 membrane fig 11 displayed the membrane characteristics and performances obtained after immersing the phnt0 5 5 250 casting solution in different coagulation bath temperatures the membrane immersed in 10 c coagulation bath phnt0 5 5 250 cb10 has increased the thickness layer to 176 μm with smaller sps of 1 81 μm and slightly reduced the ca to 129 as shown in fig 11a on the other hand the membrane immersed in 50 c phnt0 5 5 250 cb50 showed no significant change of pore size and thickness compared to phnt0 5 5 250 membrane however 50 c of the coagulation bath has slightly altered the membrane surface structure as shown in fig 11b the cold temperatures e g 10 c and 20 c has formed entangling string like structure while warm temperature produced flower like structure that slightly improved porosity to 92 the obtained membrane porosity is aligned with the formation of sps and the permeation of otc permeate flux refer fig 11c in fig 11c the otc permeate flux at 10 c obtained the lowest permeability compared to 20 c and 50 c the average flux at 50 c is almost closed to phnt0 5 5 250 membrane with stable permeability upon 3 h this shows that at higher temperatures the non solvent solvent exchange rate is accelerated due to rapid phase separation kinetics which results in greater pore size higher porosity and a thinner thickness layer 82 as a result the flux permeability of the prepared membranes is improved in addition all of the prepared membrane using different coagulation bath temperature had similar selectivity after 3 h of operation process 98 of otc rejection as depicted in fig 11d therefore due to the insignificant differences between 20 c and 50 c of modified membranes this study has selected 20 c modified membrane within the ambient temperature range for further flux recovery investigation overall a higher flux permeation and slightly lower selectivity of phnt0 5 5 250 membrane than phnt0 5 membrane were influenced by the formation of larger pore size which suggested due to the mass transfer mechanism in dcmd the viscous flow model is frequently neglected because both feed and permeate solutions are in direct contact with membrane under atmospheric conditions therefore the total pressure remains constant at atmospheric pressure resulting in negligible viscous flow 83 previous research has looked at the flow model prediction on pore sizes that are similar to the pore size measured in this work which increased from 0 39 μm phnt0 5 to 0 44 μm phnt0 5 5 250 at temperatures ranging from 15 to 48 c minimum and 60 to 75 c maximum throughout the dcmd process they found that the estimated mean free path for water vapor obtained slightly lower 0 13 to 0 16 μm than the range of membrane pore size 0 18 to 0 45 μm hence the knudsen number k n has fall within the transition region 0 01 k n 10 and leading to knudsen molecular diffusion 84 85 from this study the improved permeability of the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane with slightly lower selectivity was caused by suspected knudsen molecular diffusion during the dcmd process as it is one of the most accurate predictions of flux for dcmd 3 3 effect of different thickness layer on heat transfer across the membrane heat transfer across the membranes was calculated using the variables parameters displayed in tables 4 5 and 6 the optimized membrane parameters for good permeate flux performance are suggested to have thickness range of 10 to 700 μm depending upon the mass transport and energy loss porosity higher than 75 thermal conductivity in the range of 0 06 w mk and a suitable mechanical strength depends on the membrane material and thickness 86 from this study the value obtained for thickness porosity and thermal conductivity of the prepared membranes are in the range of the suggested value of optimized membrane parameters as shown in table 4 meanwhile the effect of different thickness layer on heat transfer across the membranes and thermal efficiency is depicted in fig 12 in fig 12a heat of conduction qc for phnt0 5 5 membrane thick is 4065 78 w m2 while phnt0 5 5 250 membrane thin has increased up to 5056 65 w m2 respectively this shows that the heat transfer through the thin membrane was greater than that across the thicker membrane due to the heat loss by conduction however the higher flux obtained by thin membrane was suggested due to the increase of vaporization heat qv 5491 63 w m2 during the process than qc consequently it generated more water vapor which influenced the improvement of flux permeation generally the driving force reduction is frequently stated as tpc which typically ranges from 0 to 1 when the tpc drops below 0 2 the process is considered as heat transfer limited implying poor design meanwhile tpc higher than 0 6 indicates a mass transfer limited mechanism with low membrane permeability and the tpc range of 0 4 to 0 7 is deemed satisfactory 49 in this study the tpc values of both membranes could be considered in satisfactory range with values of 0 45 phnt0 5 5 and 0 32 phnt0 5 5 250 respectively the result indicates that the heat loss is not a controlling parameter in this case it was suggested due to less thickness of the prepared membrane that influenced the flux permeation including higher porosity and lower thermal conductivity 87 moreover the presence of hnt in thin layer might facilitated a higher flux permeation due to well distribution in polymer solution and low thermal conductivity property 88 a previous study stated that the thermal insulating filler could separate the polymer molecules and filled the space between the polymer molecules thus imparting a low thermal conductivity of the prepared membrane 87 consequently it induced more energy transferred by the water vapor hence increasing the flux permeability thus this study found that the thin thickness layer has influenced the improvement of flux and increased the thermal efficiency of phnt0 5 5 250 membrane to 52 06 instead of heat loss across the membrane the thermal efficiency is related to the thermal conductivity km of the produced membranes as shown in table 5 the calculation of thermal efficiency is provided in supplementary material sm1 al obaidani used mathematical modelling to determine the relationship between thermal conductivity and flux permeability he claimed that when thermal conductivity increased flux permeability and thermal efficiency decreased 89 a lower km value was discovered to have a higher thermal efficiency during the dcmd process than a higher km value according to a study the temperature difference between two sides of membrane e g tfm tpm for thickness within 150 to 200 μm ought to be 10 c and lower temperature difference could achieve higher thermal efficiency 86 therefore the lower km 0 05970 w mk and temperature difference on both sides tfm and tpm with high ɛ 90 which obtained by thin membrane might facilitate the vaporization heat during dcmd process and thus slightly increased the permeate flux and thermal efficiency of the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane than the phnt0 5 5 membrane 3 4 flux recovery of modified phnt0 5 membrane including regeneration and long term performances the normalized flux of phnt0 5 15 phnt0 5 5 and phnt0 5 5 250 membranes was evaluated and presented in fig 13a meanwhile fig 13b represents the flux recovery and fouling rate of these membranes after 3 h operation process relatively it is necessary to determine performance reversibility for the potential reusable prepared membranes among these membranes the 30 min of ethanol cleaning has significantly removed the fouling resistance of pvdf membrane with 0 5 hnt tian and co workers also found that cleaning using ethanol produced better improvement in flux recovery of the prepared membrane 90 hence this statement supports the result obtained in this study fig 13a shows that most of these three membranes have achieved normalized flux 1 00 of j jo ratio the change of vapor permeation rate was initiated after 1 h of membrane permeation and start to stabilize back at the third hour of separation process reducing the thickness setting with lower immersion time has facilitated a better flux permeability throughout 3 h permeation process compared to higher thickness setting and longer immersion time a good interfacial adhesion between pvdf hnt chains might assist the formation of decent membrane inner layer when applying both parameters 5 s immersion time and 250 μm of thickness setting and improved the performances of phnt0 5 5 250 membrane moreover investigation on flux recovery of these prepared membrane was further identified and proved to achieved high percentages as shown in fig 13b a complete flux recovery was obtained by phnt0 5 5 250 membrane after 3 h of separation process followed by 88 and 79 for phnt0 5 5 and phnt0 5 15 membranes respectively thus lower immersion time and reducing nominal thickness seem to facilitate higher flux recovery compared to higher variables of both parameters relatively the lowest values of tfdr ifdr and frr percentages for pht0 5 5 250 membrane revealed better resistance of organic fouling throughout dcmd 91 aside from partial wetting the calculated negative value of tfdr percentage by eq 18 described the higher penetration of water vapor molecules through the membrane pores during otc separation consequently the higher porosity of this membrane might initiate smaller conductive heat transfer coefficients of the vapor trapped in the pores than the materials of prepared membranes 92 hence reducing temperature polarization and increasing water vapor permeation the resultant antifouling properties of the prepared membranes can be clearly explained through the proposed illustration of process interactions occurring during cleaning as shown in fig 14 the figure shows that the hydrophobic surface of the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane facilitates water vapor permeation and otc removal during dcmd the non volatile otc molecules are attached to the hydrophobic surface by hydrogen bonding and electrical interaction allowing only water vapor to pass through the membrane pores however partial wetting will slowly occur during the operation thereby causing less hydrophobicity to the membrane surface and influencing the penetration of some otc molecules aside from membrane surface these molecules may attach to the inner layer of the membrane or leave the membrane layer depending on the pore interaction the cleaning process using pure ethanol assists the detachment of otc on the surface and inner layer of the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane the h atom of otc molecules attached to the f atom of the phnt surface is held by hydrogen bonding leading to the foulant layer however the weak hydrogen can alleviate the non hydrogen bonded molecules and initiate a weaker hydrogen bond strength hence removing the otc molecules 93 a previous study on the interaction of otc with ethanol aqueous mixture described that the density of otc could reduce in a higher concentration of ethanol at room temperature by increasing its negativity this outcome was due to the strong influence of otc solubility with the strength of the intermolecular forces among the dissolved otc and the surrounding ethanol molecules 94 therefore in this study the immersion of ethanol towards the membrane is suggested to reduce the density of otc attached to the membrane surface or inner layer and bonded with the hydroxyl group oh in ethanol the otc molecules might absorb enough kinetic energy for them to break and form new bonds with ethanol the efficiency of ethanol was proved by tian and co workers in the comparison between sodium hydroxide naoh and ethanol for the cleaning process ethanol cleaning significantly removed the foulant layer compared to naoh cleaning 90 moreover during water permeation of the cleaned membrane the water vapor that continuously moved through the membrane could weaken the hydrogen bonding of remained otc molecules small amount and slowly removed the molecules from the membrane 95 therefore the removal efficiency of otc improved the flux recovery and increased the frr percentage as discussed in the previous paragraph overall the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane showed a significant improvement in membrane performances particularly flux recovery hence this phnt0 5 5 250 membrane was further investigated for regeneration and long term performances regeneration of phnt0 5 5 250 membrane was evaluated for flux permeability otc removal normalized flux and flux recovery with fouling rate after each cycle until the 5th cycle of md operation process each cycle consisting of a 6 h permeation process followed by ethanol cleaning as shown in fig 15 in fig 15a the average flux of phnt0 5 5 250 membrane 6 53 l m2h has slowly decreased to 4 21 l m2h this membrane still can be regenerated over 60 after 5th cycle of the md operation process the reduction of flux permeation could be due to the aromatic rings of otc molecules that interacted with the membrane surface and might require longer cleaning process to increase the regeneration percentage this statement was clarified in previous study using dye molecules which also consisted of aromatic rings in their structure and caused pore blocking hence reduced the vapor permeate flux 96 however the otc removal has maintained 99 for each cycle which proved the ability of this membrane in removing this antibiotic molecule the error bars in fig 15b had significantly proved the high consistency of otc removal for each cycle after duplication in fig 15c the normalized flux of each cycle was evaluated to identify the stability of the flux permeation at each minute a descending trend with minimum ratio value of j jo by 0 63 after the 5th cycle was obtained which corresponded to the flux regeneration percentage as mentioned above below 750 min the permeability of this membrane was significantly inconsistence the water vapor permeation of each minutes obtained higher flux permeation than initial flux and increased up to 1 58 of j jo ratio at certain minute meanwhile above 750 min permeation the flux seemed to show a more stable flux permeability the cleaning process of each cycle might disturb the wetting resistance of this membrane and lead to flux reduction after 5th cycle of membrane regeneration furthermore the calculated flux recovery at different cycle achieved 84 3rd cycle with fouling rate not 31 after ongoing the 5th cycle these results demonstrated that the hnt loadings in pvdf membrane not only played the role as pore forming agent but also as surface modifier to remove otc due to its natural ability 97 phnt0 5 5 250 membrane seems to behave better in long term operation compared to regeneration process of every 6 h permeation water and otc separation long term operation for phnt0 5 5 250 membrane shows a very stable flux permeation after 24 h of otc separation process fig 16a presents the permeate flux of otc solution with normalized flux ratio the consistency of the membrane flux was significantly observed and proved by the normalized flux ratio value which almost closed to 1 00 the long term operation of this membrane not only achieved higher and consistence flux permeation yet it also assisted a complete rejection of otc molecules 100 as shown in fig 10b moreover the prepared membrane has achieved 100 frr which can be due to the wetting resistance properties such as lep and ca that meet the requirement of md membrane the desired wetting resistance characteristics can prevent severe adsorption of the charged antibiotic molecules on the surface of the membrane and produce better antifouling properties 98 the antifouling properties have proved by the low fouling rate frr tfdr and ifdr values which is 10 after 24 h of long term operation process overall the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane has significantly achieved the desired md membrane and improved its performances with better antifouling properties 4 conclusion efficient performance of the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane for the removal of otc antibiotic was obtained using optimal immersion time of 5 s and nominal thickness of 250 μm for the development of new hydrophobic md membrane the introduction of hnt in the hydrophobic pvdf membrane was successfully implemented to improve the characteristics and the performances of the pristine membrane for md application this membrane was compared using 5 s and 15 s of immersion time then improved by 100 μm and 250 μm respectively the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane was evaluated based on the improvement of flux permeation with acceptable otc removal this membrane not only shows a significant improvement in membrane performances but it also obtains the desired wetting characteristics of ca lep porosity as well as pore formation the experimental findings proved that the reduction of membrane thickness using 250 μm could increase the membrane flux about 38 4 however lower thickness 100 μm had reduced the endurance of prepared membrane the excellent interfacial adhesion of 0 5 of hnt particles in the pvdf membrane using 20 c coagulation bath temperature formed better pore formation after introducing low immersion time with less membrane thickness therefore the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane was selected for further investigation on membrane reversibility including regeneration and long term operation the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane was successfully obtained high flux recovery for both operation processes with low fouling rate particularly for long term operation the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane was able to remove up to 98 of otc molecules from the feed solution the regeneration and long operation on the other hand facilitated a 99 9 100 otc removal in conclusion the phnt0 5 5 250 membrane is an alternative hydrophobic membrane for removing otc molecules via dcmd which can be further improved for superhydrophobic surface layer hence assisted higher membrane permeability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
