15825,genx the ammonium salt of hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid has been used as a replacement for perfluorooctanoic acid due to its widespread uses genx has been detected in waters around the world amid growing concerns about its persistence and adverse health effects as relevant regulations are rapidly evolving new technologies are needed to cost effectively remove and degrade genx in this study we developed an adsorptive photocatalyst by depositing a small amount 3 wt of bismuth bi onto activated carbon supported titanate nanotubes bi tnts ac and tested the material for adsorption and subsequent solid phase photodegradation of genx bi tnts ac at 1 g l was able to adsorb genx 100 µg l ph 7 0 within 1 h and then degrade 70 0 and mineralize 42 7 of pre sorbed genx under uv 254 nm in 4 h the efficient degradation also regenerated the material allowing for repeated uses without chemical regeneration material characterizations revealed that the active components of bi tnts ac included activated carbon anatase and bi nanoparticles with a metallic bi core and an amorphous bi2o3 shell electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping uv vis diffuse reflectance spectrometry and photoluminescence analyses indicated the superior photoactivity of bi tnts ac was attributed to enhanced light harvesting and generation of charge carriers due to the uv induced surface plasmon resonance effect which was enabled by the metallic bi nanoparticles oh radicals and photogenerated holes h were responsible for degradation of genx based on the analysis of degradation byproducts and density functional theory calculations photocatalytic degradation of genx started with cleavage of the carboxyl group and or ether group by oh h and or eaq and the resulting intermediates were transformed into shorter chain fluorochemicals following the stepwise defluorination mechanism bi tnts ac holds the potential for more cost effective degradation of genx and other per and polyfluorinated alkyl substances graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords genx adsorptive photocatalyst adsorption photocatalysis defluorination pfas 1 introduction per and polyfluorinated alkyl substances pfas are a diverse group of organic chemicals with an aliphatic carbon backbone where all or most of the c h bonds are replaced with c f bonds the highly polarized and stable c f bonds 531 5 kj mol make these chemicals thermally and chemically stable and unreactive yang et al 2015 because of the unique properties pfas have been used in a wide array of commercial and industrial products or processes rahman et al 2014 wang et al 2015 currently more than 4000 pfas are available on the global market lenka et al 2021 consequently pfas have been widely detected in the aquatic systems perfluorooctanoate pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos have been of particular concern due to widespread occurrence in water bodies adverse health effect and resistance to conventional water treatment processes cui et al 2018 lindstrom et al 2011 human exposure to pfoa and pfos has been linked to cancer elevated cholesterol immune suppression and endocrine disruption li et al 2020a the health concerns prompted manufacturers in europe and north america to replace pfoa and pfos with shorter chain pfas in the early 2000s sunderland et al 2019 the most notable substitute is the chemical known as genx which is also known as hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid hfpo da or perfluoro 2 propoxypropanoic acid pfpropra genx was introduced in 2009 by dupont de nemours inc in addition from 2003 on 3m company replaced pfos with perfluorobutanesulfonate pfbs in several of its major products christensen et al 2019 as regulatory actions have been focused on the legacy pfas pfoa and pfos the use of short chain substitutes has become a norm in the global fluoropolymer industry the european union produced 10 100 tons of genx per year heydebreck et al 2015 consequently genx has been increasingly detected in waters since 2015 at levels from tens of ng l to 4 5 µg l and in many cases genx became the predominant pfas brandsma et al 2019 heydebreck et al 2015 likewise pfbs was detected in drinking water at concentrations as high as 0 3 µg l mdh minnesota department of health 2017 while genx was thought to be a sustainable replacement for pfoa some recent studies have raised growing concerns about its potential adverse effects gomis et al 2018 reported that genx showed higher toxicity for male rats than pfoa wang et al 2017 observed that exposure to hfpo da 1 mg kg body weight induced more extensive hepatomegaly for mice than pfoa the latest assessment from the u s environmental protection agency us epa reported a safe daily ingestion level of 3 10 6 mg genx per kg body weight which is lower than the 2018 level by a factor of 2 7 the hill 2021 genx has been widely detected in rivers impacted by fluorochemical plants in the netherlands germany china and united states with the highest concentrations at 812 86 1 3100 and 4500 ng l respectively brandsma et al 2019 gebbink et al 2017 heydebreck et al 2015 sun et al 2016 the genx concentrations in these drinking water sources far exceeded the us epa s lifetime health advisory level of 70 ng l for the sum of pfoa and pfos in drinking water epa 2016a 2016b a recent study reported that genx was detected in 659 out of 837 private wells surrounding a fluorochemical manufacturing facility in north carolina with the maximum genx concentration reaching 4000 ng l and genx in 207 wells exceeded the state s provisional drinking water health goal of 140 ng l deq north carolina department of environmental quality 2018 to mitigate human exposure researchers have tested various technologies to remove or degrade genx in drinking water for example dixit et al 2021 reported that 221 g l of a strong base anion exchange resin purolite a860 was able to decrease genx levels from 10 µg l to 10 ng l wang et al 2019 compared adsorption of genx by activated carbon ac and ion exchange resins and found that the ira67 resin offered 4 times greater capacity than the best ac tested mantripragada et al 2021 observed that functionalized nanofibers provided a maximum genx removal capacity of 0 6 mmol g while these adsorbents could physically remove genx they do not degrade the chemical moreover the regeneration of these rather expensive materials requires toxic volatile and costly solvents such as methanol and generates large amounts of toxic spent regenerant that requires additional handling and disposal xu et al 2020a destructive techniques such as advanced oxidation and reduction processes have also been investigated in recent years bao et al 2018 olvera vargas et al 2021 pica et al 2019 bao et al 2018 reported that nearly complete genx was reductively degraded after 2 h in a uv sulfite system and 90 of fluoride ions were recovered after 6 h pica et al 2019 reported that boron doped diamond anodes were capable of degrading 60 of genx 4 98 mg l in nanofiltration retentate within 4 h and olvera vargas et al 2021 found that 90 genx was mineralized by electro fenton paired with boron doped diamond information has been very limited on photocatalytic degradation of genx using heterogeneous photocatalysts in a recent work that primarily targeting pfoa duan et al 2020 observed that about 16 of genx c0 50 mg l ph 3 0 was degraded after 120 min of uv 254 nm irradiation and in the presence of boron nitride in addition current photocatalytic practices have been limited to treating bulk water by irradiating large volumes of water photocatalysts mixtures which is not only energy intensive but also requires large volume reactors and equipment due to the high capital and operation costs herkert et al 2020 these technologies may be feasible to degrade high concentrations of pfas but less practical for treatment of large volumes of water containing low concentrations of pfas in a previous work we developed ac supported titanate nanotubes tnts ac through a hydrothermal treatment approach using commercially available ac and tio2 liu et al 2016 tnts ac was able to pre concentrate low concentrations of phenanthrene onto the photoactive surface heterojunctions and subsequently degrade the chemical such adsorptive photocatalysts enable a novel concentrate destroy strategy where the target pfas are pre concentrated from a large volume of water onto a small volume of a photocatalyst and then degraded by irradiation of the pfas bearing solid particles namely instead of applying uv irradiation to a large volume of raw water only a small volume of the solids is subjected to uv light resulting in a significant energy saving however plain tnts ac bear with some critical drawbacks for the treatment of pfas li et al 2020a including 1 the negative surface potential of tnts leads to unfavorable adsorption of pfas anions and 2 the relatively low separation efficiency of photoinduced electron hole e h pairs renders limited photoactivity for both legacy and emerging pfas although detailed information has yet to be explored to improve the performances for pfoa and pfos we doped tnts ac with a small fraction of fe and ga respectively in particular li et al 2020a modified tnts ac with 1 wt of fe2 1 g l ph 3 0 and found that the dopant not only facilitated a heads on adsorption mode of pfoa but also enhanced the subsequent photocatalytic degradation of pfoa with 90 of pre adsorbed pfoa degraded and 62 mineralized in 4 h under uv 254 nm irradiation more recently zhu et al 2021 developed a ga doped tnts ac and found the composite was able to completely adsorb pfos within 10 min and defluorinate 66 2 of the pre sorbed pfos after 4 h of the uv irradiation these prior studies also revealed that the different metal dopants resulted in different material structure and photocatalytic properties and reaction mechanisms for example the introduction of ga created oxygen vacancies that facilitated separation of e h pairs and generation of o2 radicals which effectively degraded pfos while fe doping caused direct decarboxylation of pfoa by h and generation of oh radicals however our preliminary tests showed that fe or ga doped tnts ac photocatalysts were less effective for genx degradation and defluorination bismuth based photocatalysts have been found effective for degrading persistent organic pollutants pops including pfas dong et al 2015 weng et al 2013 song et al 2017 reported that biocl nanosheets were able to defluorinate 59 3 of pfoa after 12 h of uv irradiation and the degradation rate was 1 7 and 14 6 times faster than that of commercial in2o3 and tio2 respectively yang et al 2021 prepared bi5o7i zno heterojunction microspheres and found the material degraded 91 of pfoa after 6 h of visible light irradiation owing to heterojunction structures formed upon calcination at 400 c which also extended the photo response to the visible light region and increased the separation efficiency of e h pairs metallic bi can also act as an excellent cocatalyst to facilitate charge carrier separation of bi3 based photocatalysts dong et al 2014a dong et al 2015 although its role has not been explored for photocatalytic degradation of pfas dong et al 2015 investigated a semimetal organic bi g c3n4 nanohybrid which showed some unique visible light photocatalytic properties when used for no removal the superior photoactivity was ascribed to the surface plasmonic resonance spr endowed by bi metal to enhance visible light harvesting and charge separation while these works have revealed the potential of bi0 bi3 based photocatalysts especially the spr enhanced photocatalytic activity these materials have not been explored for treatment of pfas the overall goal of this study was to develop and test an adsorptive photocatalyst bi tnts ac for enhanced adsorption and subsequent degradation of genx in water the specific objectives were to 1 synthesize the desired catalyst through a two step hydrothermal calcination method 2 measure the adsorption kinetics and capacity of bi tnts ac for genx 3 evaluate the material stability and reusability and 4 elucidate the reaction pathway and the underlying mechanisms for the enhanced photocatalytic activity through detailed material

3600i plus spectrophotometer 2 4 adsorption kinetic and isotherm tests adsorption kinetic experiments were conducted in 45 ml high density polypropylene hdpe vials to facilitate the chemical analysis and evaluation of material effectiveness the experimental solutions were prepared with an initial genx concentration of 100 µg l the adsorption was initiated by adding 0 04 g bi tnts ac to 40 ml of a 100 µg l genx solution with an initial ph of 7 0 0 1 the vials were placed on a rotator 70 rpm at 25 c in the dark duplicate vials were sacrificially sampled at predetermined times upon filtering through a 0 22 μm polyether sulfone pes membrane the filtrates were analyzed for genx remaining adsorption isotherms were measured in a similar manner but the mixtures were equilibrated for 24 h to ensure equilibrium the initial genx concentration was varied i e 0 1 0 4 1 3 5 20 50 80 100 mg l while the dosage of bi tnts ac was kept at 1 g l for comparison the kinetic and equilibrium isotherm tests were also carried out with treated ac and tnts ac following the same experimental protocols note no bi was detected in the supernatant during the kinetics and isotherm experiments 2 5 photodegradation of pre sorbed genx the photocatalytic degradation experiments were carried out in a rayonet rpr 100 uv reactor southern new england ultraviolet co branford ct usa equipped with 16 rpr

total genx recovery was 95 and thus no surrogate is was used during the extraction no fluoride was detected when the solids were washed with 20 ml of a 1 m naoh solution the effect of catalyst dosage on the photodegradation effectiveness were carried out following the same experimental protocol but the material dosage was varied from 1 to 5 g l 2 6 ph effect to evaluate effect of solution ph on the adsorption process experiments were conducted with 3 bi tnts ac the best performing material at a dose of 1 g l and an initial genx concentration of 100 µg l the equilibrium solution ph was 3 5 0

experimental protocols for the adsorption and the subsequent photodegradation were followed and leaching of bi and ti into the aqueous phase was analyzed after each cycle 2 8 roles of uv induced reactive species the contribution of common uv induced reactive species to the photocatalytic degradation of genx was assessed using various scavengers in particular edta isa bq and nan3 were added to experimental mixtures to quench photogenerated holes h hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 respectively van doorslaer et al 2012 the same experimental procedures were followed for the adsorption and photodegradation tests except one of the scavengers was present during the photodegradation at various concentrations 0 5 1 0 5 0 and 10 0 mm the use of the molarity units was to facilitate cross comparison among the scavengers and with literature data for other materials 2 9 density functional theory calculations the fukui functions which are based on the density functional theory dft were employed to predict the attack sites in genx for different radicals using the gaussian 16 c 01 package ji et al 2020 the geometry optimization and single point energy calculations were carried out via the b3lyp method with the 6 31 g d p basis set section s1 in sm provides more details on the dft calculations 2 10 chemical analysis aqueous phase genx concentrations

optical emission spectroscopy icp oes 710 es varian usa with a detection limit of 100 µg l and 50 µg l respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 material phases and chemical composition fig 1 a shows the xrd patterns of calcined tnts ac and bi tnts ac loaded with 1 5 wt bi for tnts ac the diffraction peaks at 10 5 24 4 28 4 and 47 8 are assigned to sodium tri titanate with a chemical formula of na x h2 x ti3o7 x depends on the sodium content wang et al 2018 the basic skeleton of tri titanate was composed of edge sharing triple tio6 octahedrons with na and h attached at the interlayers as exchangeable counter ions ma et al 2017 the intensity of the diffraction peaks of tnts ac were notably decreased compared to those of uncalcined tnts ac and uncalcined 3 bi tnts ac fig s1 which can be attributed to breakage of the tubular and layered structures during calcination razali et al 2012 partial collapse of polymerized ti species ti o ti species and or decrease in isolated ti species with higher coordination numbers yang and li 2002 moreover the xrd diffraction pattern for calcined tnts ac showed a red shift compared to that of uncalcined tnts ac e g from 9 8 to 10 5 fig s1 indicating a decrease in interlayer distance due to the release of water molecules qamar et al 2008 compared to calcined tnts ac and uncalcined bi tnts ac the xrd patterns for calcined bi tnts ac with different bi contents displayed five characteristic peaks with 2θ values of 25 3º 37 8º 48 1º 54 2º and 62 2º corresponding to the 101 004 200 211 and 213 planes of tetragonal anatase jcpds icdd no 21 1272 respectively this result indicates that sodium tri titanate was transformed into anatase due to bi doping and calcination the adsorption of bi3 ions on tnts ac partially replaced na ions which is conducive to the formation of anatase upon calcination cai et al 2017 lee et al 2007 in addition for bi tnts ac fig 1 a the characteristic peaks at 22 5º 27 2º 39 6º 44 6º 46 0º 48 7º 64 5º and 70 8º confirmed the existence of the rhombohedral phase of metallic bi jcpds icdd no 44 1246 in contrast no evidence of metallic bi peaks was observed for uncalcined bi tnts ac fig s1 indicating that the calcination facilitated the reduction of bi3 into bi0 the xps analysis confirmed that bi3 on tnts ac was reduced into bi0 with ac as the electron donor at 550 ºc fig 1 a also indicates that increasing the bi content from 1 wt to 3 wt enhanced the peak intensities of bi whereas further increasing bi to 4 and 5 wt resulted in a lower bi intensity accordingly 3 bi tnts ac demonstrated the highest genx defluorination efficiency section 3 4 and was therefore selected for further testing xps spectra were obtained to examine the chemical composition of bi tnts ac and tnts ac the scans were performed in two ways one on the pristine material surface and the other after ar ion etching at depths of 50 and 150 nm fig s2a confirms the presence of ti c na o and bi on the 3 bi tnts ac surface for the spectra of bi 4f without etching fig 1 b the peaks centered at 164 0 and 158 7 ev are characteristic of bi3 in bismuth oxides and are ascribed to bi 4f5 2 and bi 4f7 2 respectively lan et al 2020 in conjunction with the xrd results which showed no crystalline bi2o3 on bi tnts ac the bi2o3 identified by xps was amorphous the two bi 4f peaks in fig 1 b shifted from 164 0 158 7 ev to lower binding energies of 163 9 158 6 ev with 50 nm etching and 163 6 158 4 ev with 150 nm etching these results can be attributed to the partial reduction of bi3 x species liu et al 2017 two additional peaks were present at 161 6 and 156 3 ev after the 50 nm etching and these peaks were attributed to bi bi bonds and confirmed the presence of metallic bi in the composite yang et al 2020 the bi bi peak intensity was stronger for the 150 nm etching suggesting that more metallic bi was present in the particle core namely the bi particles consisted of a metallic bi core and a thin amorphous bi2o3 shell on the surface of bi tnts ac the binding energies were corrected by the c 1s levels at 284 8 ev as a reference the c 1s spectra fig 1 c measured at the surface of the pristine sample can be deconvoluted into three peaks corresponding to c o 286 0 ev c o 287 2 ev and o c o 289 6 ev bonds which were also present after the 150 nm etching with the exception of o c o bonds gopiraman et al 2017 after the 50 nm etching the oxygenated carbon groups disappeared and two additional peaks occurred at 284 6 ev and 286 6 ev the peak at 284 6 ev highlights the existence of c c groups wang et al 2020 whereas the peak at 286 6 ev was attributed to carbonyl or quinine groups ma et al 2015 in addition the o 1s xps spectra fig s2b highlighted the presence of bi o bonds at 529 7 ev and the regular lattice oxygen ti o ti at 531 3 ev almeida et al 1998 dong et al 2015 the peaks at 458 2 ev and 464 0 ev in fig s2c belong to ti 2p3 2 and ti 2p1 2 respectively which are characteristic of ti4 li et al 2020b 3 2 morphological characterization figs s3a and s3b show the sem images of 3 bi tnts ac calcined at 550 c where the surface displayed a flower like structure with interwoven tnts grafted on the ac petals micro or nano ac particles were attached to well defined tnts figs 2 a and s3b this observation indicates that the hydrothermal treatment under alkaline conditions not only converted tio2 into tnts but also altered the structure of the ac resulting in mutual modification of ac and tnts the eds mapping figs s3c and s3d revealed that five major elements i e c o ti na and bi were uniformly distributed on 3 bi tnts ac and table s3 presents the percentile of each element the high ti 36 2 c 19 2 and bi 5 2 contents corroborate the formation of bi tnts ac figs 2 a 2 c present the tem images of 3 bi tnts ac fig 2 a confirms the hybridization of tnts and ac nanoparticles the coated carbon particles on tnts are beneficial and facilitate hydrophobic interactions with genx and anion π interactions between genx and the electron deficient aromatic skeletons of ac the interlayer distance of tnts was 0 75 nm fig 2 c which agrees with the crystal plane 020 of titanate wang et al 2018 whereas the lattice fringe spacing of 0 35 nm fig 2 b conforms to the 101 plane of anatase prior work on tnts ac showed that no transformation from tri titanate to anatase would occur upon calcination without a metal dopant zhu et al 2021 this observation suggests that bi on tnts facilitated transformation from titanate to anatase while tnts retained its nanotube structure with an inner diameter of 5 nm and an outer diameter of 12 nm fig 2 c in addition the lattice spacing 0 328 nm shown in fig 2 c corresponds to the 012 lattice plane of metallic bi dong et al 2015 which is expected to facilitate electron transfer and inhibit recombination of electron hole pairs section 3 4 fig s4a shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of tnts ac and bi tnts ac with 1 5 wt bi according to the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac classification system all isotherms are type iv and characteristic of mesoporous materials in the low p p0 range the shape of the isotherms conformed to monolayer multilayer adsorption subsequently the h3 type hysteresis loops appeared at around p p0 0 40 suggesting that another adsorption mechanism such as capillary condensation occurred in the nanotubes and or mesoporous channels liu et al 2016 when the bi content was increased from 1 to 5 wt the hysteresis loop became larger which aligns with the capillary condensation mechanism el sheikh et al 2017 fig s4b gives the pore size distribution determined using the bjh method except for tnts ac and 3 bi tnts ac the pore size distributions displayed a bimodal profile with major peaks at 3 7 nm and minor peaks at 8 9 16 0 nm 3 bi tnts ac showed the most uniform pore size distribution of the bi doped composites table s4 summarizes the ssa and pore volume for all materials the ssa of tnts ac was 243 77 m2 g which is lower than that for the ac by a factor of 2 4 indicating partial blockage of the internal pores pore volume also decreased by 2 4 upon the loading of tnts when loaded with 1 2 3 4 and 5 wt of bi the ssa was increased from 243 77 m2 g for tnts ac to 307 50 279 60 289 84 285 26 and 269 78 m2 g respectively the increase in ssa stemmed from pore volume increases table s4 resulting from the bi mediated phase transformation and restructuring of tnts and ac fig s3 subramaniam et al 2017 excessive bi doping resulted in a slight decrease in ssa due to the increased crystal sizes of anatase and metallic bi which partially blocked nanopores table s5 zhong et al 2012 the newly created sites associated with the elevated ssa are expected to not only facilitate genx adsorption but also be more photoactive due to the hybridization of bi tnts and ac 3 3 genx adsorption kinetics and isotherms fig 3 a compares the genx adsorption kinetics of 3 bi tnts ac and its precursor materials ac and tnts ac which were subjected to the same hydrothermal treatment and calcination process the rate of genx adsorption by 3 bi tnts ac was nearly the same as that of the treated ac on an equal mass basis 40 mg and 99 of genx was removed in 1 h with 90 of the removal occurred in the first 10 min tnts ac showed a slower adsorption rate and equilibrium was not reached until 120 min due to the poor affinity of genx to the negatively charged tnts fig s5 shows that when the material dosage was halved to 20 mg 3 bi tnts ac displayed clearly faster adsorption rate than the treated ac the results confirmed that the bi loading notably improved the adsorption rate of genx due to 1 suppression of the negative surface potential of tnts the p h pzc of tnts and 3 bi tnts were 2 6 and 6 3 respectively and 2 lewis acid base interactions between bi and the carboxylate group of genx the pseudo first order eq 1 and pseudo second order eq 2 kinetic models were utilized to interpret the kinetic data 1 q t q e q e exp k 1 t 2 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where q t and q e µg g are the solid phase genx concentrations at time t min and equilibrium respectively and k 1 min 1 and k 2 g µg min are the respective rate constants table s6 summarizes the kinetic parameters for both models the pseudo second order model gave a better goodness of fit as evidence by the r2 0 99 for all three materials however both models can adequately fit the kinetic data the different rate constants are in line with the characterization results that the bi and tnts modifications of the ac along with the hydrothermal and calcination treatments altered accessibility of the adsorption sites because genx concentrations in industrial and contaminated waters can widely vary detailed isotherms were constructed for ac and 3 bi tnts ac over a broad range of equilibrium concentrations namely 0 1 100 mg l fig 3 b the classical langmuir eq 3 and freundlich eq eq 4 isotherm models were tested to fit the experimental data 3 q e q m a x b c e 1 b c e 4 q e k f c e 1 n where qmax mg g is the langmuir maximum capacity b l mg is the langmuir affinity coefficient kf mg g l mg 1 n is the freundlich capacity parameter and n is the heterogeneity factor related to the presence and distribution of different sorption sites table s7 summarizes the parameters for the models based on the coefficients of determination r2 both models were able to adequately fit the experimental data though the freundlich model offered better fitting for ac and tnts ac suggesting a heterogeneous nature in terms of adsorption energy and modes according to the langmuir model the maximum adsorption capacities of genx on ac tnts ac and 3 bi tnts ac were 120 26 79 96 and 101 77 mg g respectively while the ssa of treated ac was about 2 4 times greater than that of 3 bi tnts ac the langmuir maximum capacity of ac was only 1 2 times higher this disproportionality indicates that although the loading of tnts and bi on ac resulted in partial loss of the adsorption sites in the core ac it created a layer of new sites on the ac the new sites consisted of mixed phases of tnts ac particles and bi nanoparticles which enabled a synergized adsorption mechanism and enhanced affinity for genx the enhanced affinity of 3 bi tnts ac for genx can be well revealed when the isotherm data are plotted based on the surface area normalized uptake fig 3 c table s8 and fig s6 shows that the adsorption of genx by 3 bi tnts ac was much more favorable in the lower genx concentration range c e 2 mg l than treated ac and tnts ac the ssa based qmax values mg m2 followed the order of 3 bi tnts ac 0 35 tnts ac 0 33 ac 0 18 treated ac offered higher genx uptake only when the genx concentration is very high ce 2 mg l fig 3 b due to its much larger ssa 591 38 m2 g the enhanced performance of 3 bi tnts ac can be attributed to synergistic adsorption interactions between anionic genx and 3 bi tnts ac i e hydrophobic lewis acid base and anion π interactions whereas only hydrophobic interaction was operative for treated ac and tnts ac thus the improved affinity of bi tnts ac for genx is expected to not only selectively concentrate genx on the photoactive surface sites but also facilitate the subsequent solid phase photocatalytic degradation of genx fig s7 shows the measured zeta potential of 3 bi tnts ac which exhibited a p h pzc of 3 8 hence in the circumneutral ph range the adsorption of genx anions p k a 2 8 by 3 bi tnts ac would not be favorable due to electrostatic repulsion although the loading of bi suppressed the surface negative potential fig s7 while the tail group of genx is not expected to interact with tnts p h pzc 2 6 the bi deposited on the surface of bi tnts ac may react with genx through concurrent electrostatic and lewis acid base interactions between bi3 and the hydrophilic head groups coo of genx khan and siddiqui 2021 liu et al 2015 liu et al 2016 which is in line with the strong adsorption observed at neutral ph the higher genx adsorption by 3 bi tnts ac could also be due to the larger ssa resulting from the mixed phases section 3 2 which enables hydrophobic reactions between the c f chain of genx except one oxygen atom in the carbon chain and the ac surface furthermore anion π interactions may also occur between genx anions and aromatic groups on the ac surface xu et al 2020 the presence of ac and bi in the composite materials therefore enabled cooperative hydrophobic lewis acid base and anion π interactions not only enhanced the adsorption capacity for genx but also facilitated a side on adsorption mode which is conducive to the in situ photochemical degradation of pre adsorbed genx li et al 2020a 3 4 photodegradation of pre concentrated genx on bi tnts ac fig 4 shows the photocatalytic degradation rates of pre adsorbed genx by treated ac tnts ac and bi tnts ac with 1 5 wt bi after 4 h of the uv irradiation almost no genx degradation was observed for ac and tnts ac in contrast bi tnts ac degraded up to 70 0 of the pre concentrated genx with up to 42 7 defluorinated i e conversion of fluorine into fluoride extending the uv irradiation to 6 and 8 h elevated the genx photodegradation to 75 1 and 77 2 and mineralization to 45 3 and 46 1 respectively fig s8 in accord with the material characterization data 3 bi tnts ac exhibited the highest photoactivity for genx excessive bi i e 3 wt may act as recombination centers of the photo generated electrons and holes fig 5 a shows the effect of catalyst dosage 1 2 3 and 5 g l during the adsorption stage on the subsequent photodegradation defluorination of genx under uv irradiation increasing the photocatalyst dosage from 1 to 2 g l improved the 4 h genx degradation and defluorination from 70 0 to 74 1 and from 42 7 to 48 3 respectively however further increasing the dosage to 3 or 5 g l resulted in lower rates of degradation and defluorination which can be attributed to diminished light penetration as a result of elevated shading effects from denser suspended particles and aggregation of the particles ahmadpour et al 2020 mirzaei et al 2018 consequently the dosage of 2 g l was used in the subsequent studies in practice the material dosage should be tuned according to the target water quality conditions different catalyst dosages during the adsorption stage result in adsorption of genx on sites with different accessibility and photoactivity kinetically genx will be loaded on the more easily accessible sites at higher material doses from the photoactivity perspective the hybrid sites with bi tnts ac are more photoactive while the pure ac phase may only adsorb but not degrade genx while most adsorption sites of ac are located inside the particles the main adsorption sites for 3 bi tnts ac are likely to be on the outside shell the differences in adsorption sites were evidenced by the reduced ssa of 3 bi tnts ac compared to the parent ac table s4 the overall degradation efficiency depends on the fraction of genx loaded on the more photoactive sites which are accessible to not only genx but also photons photogenerated charge carriers and reactive oxygen species ros ding et al 2013 section 3 7 in practice the low fraction of non reactive sites should not affect the overall process because this photo inert adsorption capacity will remain constant in each treatment cycle and will not affect genx adsorption and photodegradation on the reactive sites which are automatically regenerated upon the photodegradation 3 5 ph effects on genx adsorption and photodegradation fig 5 b shows the effect of ph on genx adsorption by 3 bi tnts ac nearly all 99 of the genx was consistently adsorbed from the solution over a broad ph range of 3 5 10 upon equilibrium due to the low p k a value 2 8 genx mainly existed in the anionic form in the ph range tested in light of the phpzc of 3 8 for 3 bi tnts ac and 6 3 for bi tnts section 3 3 a negative overall surface potential would be expected for 3 bi tnts ac in the experimental ph range except for ph 3 5 namely electrostatic interactions between genx and 3 bi tnts ac are unfavorable at neutral or alkaline ph at more alkaline ph the surface potential of bi tnts turned more negative p h pzc 6 3 and thus the interaction with the carboxylate group of genx became more unfavorable due to electrostatic repulsion and competition of oh consequently adsorption of genx would largely rely on the hydrophobic and anion π interactions between genx and ac resulting in a vertical tail on orientation adsorption mode li et al 2020a conversely at more acidic ph adsorption of genx becomes more favorable for enhanced electrostatic interaction between the positively charged surface of bi tnts and genx and lewis acid base interaction between genx and the metals i e bi ti in this case genx tends to be adsorbed in the parallel or side on mode with both the head and tail of genx bound to the mixed phases it is noteworthy that the observed no effect of ph on adsorption could also be due to the very high removal of genx in all cases our goal here was to show that 3 bi tnts ac was able to effectively concentrate genx over a broad ph range at practically relevant dosages thus the photodegradation efficiency of genx is evaluated at the five different ph values fig 5 b the 4 h genx photodegradation showed a clear decreasing trend with increasing ph from 78 4 at ph 3 5 to 76 4 74 1 68 0 and 44 8 at ph 5 0 7 0 8 5 and 10 0 respectively apparently the photodegradation effectiveness is associated with the adsorption modes of genx as to be illustrated in sections 3 7 and 3 8 the head group decarboxylation is a critical step in the genx degradation process as such the head on or side on adsorption mode is more favorable than the vertical tail on mode for the photo generated holes and radicals to attack both the head and tail groups of a genx molecule in addition the production of photogenerated holes and radicals can be suppressed under alkaline conditions excessively high ho could react with photogenerated holes to produce excessive oh which inhibit the direct hole oxidation of genx section 3 7 li et al 2020a moreover acidic conditions are favorable for formation of ho2 which is a precursor of h2o2 and oh eq 6 song et al 2012 6 o 2 h ho 2 p k a 4 88 3 6 stability and reusability of bi tnts ac the efficient photodegradation of sorbed genx was expected to automatically regenerate the material for repeated uses to test this hypothesis 3 bi tnts ac was subjected to five consecutive cycles of adsorption and photodegradation after the fifth cycle 3 bi tnts ac was still able to adsorb 98 of the genx from solution fig 5 c indicating that the material retained its adsorption capacity in addition the genx mineralization efficiency only exhibited a modest decrease from 48 3 to 43 7 after the five cycles potentially due to competition from accumulated short chain intermediates produced in previous cycles no loss in ti content was detected and 1 0 wt of the doped bi leached into the solution after the five cycles 3 7 mechanisms of enhanced genx photodegradation by bi tnts ac to understand the roles of common reactive species photocatalytic degradation experiments were carried out in the presence of radical scavengers namely isa for oh bq for o2 edta for the photo generated h and nan3 for 1o2 fig 6 a shows the 4 h photodegradation efficiency for genx in the presence of variable concentrations 0 5 1 5 and 10 mm of isa nan3 bq or edta nan3 and bq showed only modest or negligible effects on the photodegradation indicating that neither o2 nor 1o2 reacted with genx in contrast the photodegradation decreased from 74 1 without a scavenger to 43 0 in the presence of 0 5 mm isa and to 1 5 when the isa concentration was increased to 10 mm indicating that oh played a critical role in the photodegradation process the addition of 0 5 10 mm of edta lowered the genx degradation to 66 9 56 2 suggesting that h also played an important role fig 6 b compares the epr spectra of dmpo oh adducts generated in the tnts ac and 3 bi tnts ac systems after 10 and 20 min of uv irradiation a weaker oh signal four lines with an intensity ratio of nearly 1 2 2 1 was observed for tnts ac while a stronger oh signal was evident after the incorporation of 3 wt bi on tnts ac the oh signal intensity increased with the irradiation time fig 6 b due to the resulting oh no o2 or 1o2 signals were detected for 3 bi tnts ac figs s9a and s9b the results confirmed the findings from the radical quenching experiments fig 6 a fig 6 c compares the optical properties of tnts ac and bi tnts ac with 1 5 wt bi bi tnts ac exhibited greater light absorption than tnts ac throughout the uv and visible ranges 200 800 nm though tnts ac did demonstrate notable light absorbance due to the carbon kakavandi et al 2019 velasco arias et al 2012 in particular the maximum absorbance 285 nm for 3 bi tnts ac was 14 higher than that 310 nm for tnts ac these results confirmed that the bi particles on the surface enhanced light harvesting leading to enhanced photogeneration of electrons and holes this phenomenon is attributed to the spr effect endowed by the metallic bi on tnts ac dong et al 2015 showed that the electromagnetic field distribution of bi spheres reached its maximum at the surface of metallic bi particles and they observed that the spr property of bi could markedly enhance visible light harvesting and charge separation when the surface plasmon wave interacts with a local particle or rough surface some of the energy can be re emitted as light other studies have also demonstrated that bi particles display strong spr effects in the uv range 228 280 nm depending on their particle size and shape dong et al 2014b ma et al 2013 wang et al 2005 for instance ma et al 2013 determined two spr absorption peaks at 228 nm and 256 nm for mixed plate like 40 70 nm and polyhedral 500 nm bi nanocrystals wang et al 2005 synthesized stabilized bismuth nanoparticles 10 nm that showed a surface plasmon absorption peak at 281 nm moreover 3 bi tnts ac also exhibited enhanced visible light absorption which is in agreement with previous reports that bi displayed spr effect in both ultraviolet and visible light domains sun et al 2015 sun et al 2017 pl emission intensity has been used to measure the recombination of photo induced electrons and holes fig s10 shows the pl emission spectra of tnts ac and 3 bi tnts ac while the pl intensity for tnts ac included two large peaks the spectra for 3 bi tnts ac was almost flat indicating that deposition of bi resulted in a remarkable decline in the recombination of electron hole pairs this observation agrees with the notion that metallic bi can serve as an effective electron trap and thus facilitate electron hole separation dong et al 2014a chen et al 2017 prepared bi bi2o3 core shell nanoparticles and found that metallic bi nanoparticles can generate charge carriers due to the spr effect while the amorphous bi2o3 surface layer serves as an efficient electron and hole acceptor to guide the directional transfer of photo charges and enhance the separation of electron hole pairs the bi2o3 shell could also protect the metallic bi core from oxidation which not only preserves the reactive lifetime but also provides a safe environment for photocatalytic reactions chen et al 2017 based on the experimental results and material characterization fig 7 illustrates the key mechanisms governing the enhanced adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of genx by bi tnts ac first the incorporation of bi nanoparticles on bi tnts ac creates a more favorable environment for adsorption due to suppression of the surface negative potential the surface bi along with ti also serves as a lewis acid to bind with the carboxylate group of genx anions which is conducive to the decarboxylation reaction that is often an essential step for pfas degradation zhu et al 2021 second the bi nanoparticles enhance light absorbance fig 6 c favoring the production of photogenerated electrons and holes third due to photo induced spr the metallic bi is photoexcited and promotes excitation of surface electrons generation of more charge carriers and interfacial electron transfer chen et al 2017 fourth because the fermi level vs nhe of metallic bi 0 17 ev dong et al 2015 is lower than the conduction band cb level of tnts ac 0 12 ev dang et al 2020 the photoexcited electrons tend to flow from bi to tnts ac decreasing the recombination rate of electron hole pairs and increasing the lifetime of charge carriers in tnts ac fifth the electron release results in positively charged bin which attract and trap photoexcited electrons from the valence band vb of tnts ac to maintain charge neutrality dong et al 2014a further inhibiting e h recombination and leaving more holes available for reacting with genx lastly the local electromagnetic field representing the spr effects of bi metal can also enhance the generation of electron hole pairs and subsequent separation of the charge carriers tu et al 2015 afterwards the separated electrons will reduce o2 to h2o2 because the redox potential of o2 h2o2 0 695 ev moon et al 2017 is more positive than that of the cb of tnts ac and subsequently h2o2 is transformed into oh by trapping an electron dong et al 2014a given the redox potential of o2 o2 0 33 ev the cb electrons are less likely to react with o2 dong et al 2014a conversely the holes with a redox potential of 3 85 ev can facilitate decarboxylation of genx and oxidation of ho into oh radicals e0 1 99 ev for oh oh dong et al 2014a as oh radicals and h are the major reactive species the photocatalytic degradation of genx adsorbed on bi tnts ac was enhanced fig 8 a shows the molecular structure of genx with labeled sites figs 8 b and 8 c show the highest occupied molecule orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo of genx respectively and indicate that the carboxylate group is a favorable attack site for photogenerated holes and radicals while the gain or loss of electrons on each genx molecule site cannot be accurately obtained ji et al 2020 the condensed fukui functions were calculated based on the natural population analysis npa scheme to identify the electrophilic f nucleophilic f and radical f 0 reactive sites in genx fig 8 d based on the condensed fukui function values of 0 3309 and 0 3273 the most reactive sites for electrophilic attack are o19 and o20 respectively of the carboxylate group the same sites also exhibit the highest f 0 values namely 0 1906 and 0 1981 respectively therefore the carboxylate group of genx is most prone to the attack by the photogenerated radicals which is in agreement with previous reports of photocatalytic degradation of long chain pfas xu et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 the surface contour of f for genx indicates that c1 0 1084 and c2 0 1188 in the cf3cf2cf2 end group are most vulnerable to nucleophilic attack this observation agrees with the report by bao et al 2018 however bao et al 2018 also proposed that the optimal trajectory for radicals to attack the carboxyl group of genx is blocked by cf3 due to steric hindrance pica et al 2019 asserted that oh attack on the ether bond of genx is kinetically unfavorable because of the high activation barrier 321 kj mol though the attack can result in concurrent decarboxylation while the initial oxidative attack does not break the ether bond stepwise mineralization can occur along the acidic side chain moreover the ether bond introduces a weak point in the perfluorinated carbon chain facilitating degradation by hydrated electrons 3 8 pathways of genx photodegradation by bi tnts ac fig s11 shows the chromatograms of two major stable intermediate products tfa cf3cooh and pfa c2f5cooh detected after the 4 h photocatalytic degradation of genx by 3 bi tnts ac other intermediates were either unstable or unidentifiable taken together the mechanism analysis reactive species quenching data dft calculations intermediates and findings from recent studies bao et al 2018 pica et al 2019 vakili et al 2021 the photodegradation of genx by 3 bi tnts ac may occur along two possible pathways fig 9 the first pathway starts with decarboxylation by oh and or h to generate an activated intermediate c5f11o then the c5f11o radical interacts with oh and or h2o to form unstable c3f7ocf3cfoh which subsequently transforms into c3f7ocof after elimination of a cf3 moiety on the α carbon pica et al 2019 upon further reaction with oh c3f7ocof converts into c4f8ho3 and subsequently generates cf3cf2cf2o through cleavage of the fcooh moiety finally cf3cf2cf2o continues to lose the cf2o groups until complete mineralization pica et al 2019 vakili et al 2021 the second pathway is initiated by reduction of the ether group by photogenerated electrons to form c3f7 and c3f4o3 fragments the carboxylate fragment c3f4o3 is degraded in a similar manner as pathway 1 specifically the carboxylate group is cleaved and the active intermediate reacts with oh and or h2o to form the unstable c2f4ooh which is converted to c2f4o after one h2o molecule is eliminated then c2f4o is hydrolyzed to cf3coo tfa with the expulsion of h and f the c3f7 fragment may react with oh or h2o to generate unstable c3f7oh which further transforms into cf3cf2cof upon hydrolysis cf3cf2cof converts into c2f5coo pfa which is converted into c2f5oh upon decarboxylation by oh and h niu et al 2012 the unstable alcohol undergoes intramolecular rearrangement to form cf3cof and converts into cf3coo niu et al 2012 in addition electrons may attack other fluorine atoms in the fluorocarbon tail park et al 2009 song et al 2013 resulting in an alternative pathway for pfa photodegradation where pfa is transformed into cf3ch2coo via h f exchange and subsequently converted into cf3coo upon elimination of a ch2 moiety bao et al 2018 park et al 2009 song et al 2013 the tfa generated from decomposition of the two genx fragments may be further degraded to cf3 and coo the resulting cf3 may combine with other radicals e g cf3 or h to form gaseous products e g cf3h c2f6 bao et al 2018 4 conclusions a new adsorptive photocatalyst was prepared characterized and tested for degradation of genx as a model emerging pfas the major findings are summarized as follows 1 the most reactive bi tnts ac was prepared by depositing 3 wt bi on ac supported titanate nanotubes constructed with commercially available ac and p25 2 material characterization indicated that bi was deposited on the material surface as nanoparticles with a metallic bi core and amorphous bi2o3 shell in addition micro or nanoscale ac particles were also observed on tnts 3 bi tnts ac was able to adsorb nearly all genx in 1 h effectively concentrating genx on the photoactive sites subsequently 70 0 of the pre sorbed genx was degraded including 42 7 defluorinated after 4 h of uv irradiation the photodegradation process also regenerated the material enabling repeated uses without additional chemical regeneration 4 the hybrid bi anatase and ac phases at the microscale or nanoscale facilitated enhanced adsorption of genx through concurrent and synergistic hydrophobic lewis acid base and anion π interactions 5 the spr effect enabled by the metallic bi nanoparticles greatly enhanced light harvesting generation of charge carriers and separation of e h pairs 6 while dft findings suggested that the carboxylate group was the prone to the radical attack in the uv system the ether bond was a favorable attack site for photogenerated electrons 7 oh radicals and photogenerated h were the main reactive species for the photocatalytic degradation of genx by bi tnts ac which starts with cleavage of the carboxylate group conversion to cf3cf2cf2o via decarboxylation and cf3 elimination and continues through sequential loss of cf2o groups until complete mineralization in addition the ether bond in the genx molecule may be attacked by photogenerated electrons opening up another degradation pathway given the widespread use of genx as a substitute for legacy pfas and the growing health concerns bi tnts ac and the concentrate and destroy concept may serve as an important technology for cost effective treatment of genx contaminated waters credit authorship contribution statement yangmo zhu conceptualization methodology software formal analysis

15825,genx the ammonium salt of hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid has been used as a replacement for perfluorooctanoic acid due to its widespread uses genx has been detected in waters around the world amid growing concerns about its persistence and adverse health effects as relevant regulations are rapidly evolving new technologies are needed to cost effectively remove and degrade genx in this study we developed an adsorptive photocatalyst by depositing a small amount 3 wt of bismuth bi onto activated carbon supported titanate nanotubes bi tnts ac and tested the material for adsorption and subsequent solid phase photodegradation of genx bi tnts ac at 1 g l was able to adsorb genx 100 µg l ph 7 0 within 1 h and then degrade 70 0 and mineralize 42 7 of pre sorbed genx under uv 254 nm in 4 h the efficient degradation also regenerated the material allowing for repeated uses without chemical regeneration material characterizations revealed that the active components of bi tnts ac included activated carbon anatase and bi nanoparticles with a metallic bi core and an amorphous bi2o3 shell electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping uv vis diffuse reflectance spectrometry and photoluminescence analyses indicated the superior photoactivity of bi tnts ac was attributed to enhanced light harvesting and generation of charge carriers due to the uv induced surface plasmon resonance effect which was enabled by the metallic bi nanoparticles oh radicals and photogenerated holes h were responsible for degradation of genx based on the analysis of degradation byproducts and density functional theory calculations photocatalytic degradation of genx started with cleavage of the carboxyl group and or ether group by oh h and or eaq and the resulting intermediates were transformed into shorter chain fluorochemicals following the stepwise defluorination mechanism bi tnts ac holds the potential for more cost effective degradation of genx and other per and polyfluorinated alkyl substances graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords genx adsorptive photocatalyst adsorption photocatalysis defluorination pfas 1 introduction per and polyfluorinated alkyl substances pfas are a diverse group of organic chemicals with an aliphatic carbon backbone where all or most of the c h bonds are replaced with c f bonds the highly polarized and stable c f bonds 531 5 kj mol make these chemicals thermally and chemically stable and unreactive yang et al 2015 because of the unique properties pfas have been used in a wide array of commercial and industrial products or processes rahman et al 2014 wang et al 2015 currently more than 4000 pfas are available on the global market lenka et al 2021 consequently pfas have been widely detected in the aquatic systems perfluorooctanoate pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos have been of particular concern due to widespread occurrence in water bodies adverse health effect and resistance to conventional water treatment processes cui et al 2018 lindstrom et al 2011 human exposure to pfoa and pfos has been linked to cancer elevated cholesterol immune suppression and endocrine disruption li et al 2020a the health concerns prompted manufacturers in europe and north america to replace pfoa and pfos with shorter chain pfas in the early 2000s sunderland et al 2019 the most notable substitute is the chemical known as genx which is also known as hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid hfpo da or perfluoro 2 propoxypropanoic acid pfpropra genx was introduced in 2009 by dupont de nemours inc in addition from 2003 on 3m company replaced pfos with perfluorobutanesulfonate pfbs in several of its major products christensen et al 2019 as regulatory actions have been focused on the legacy pfas pfoa and pfos the use of short chain substitutes has become a norm in the global fluoropolymer industry the european union produced 10 100 tons of genx per year heydebreck et al 2015 consequently genx has been increasingly detected in waters since 2015 at levels from tens of ng l to 4 5 µg l and in many cases genx became the predominant pfas brandsma et al 2019 heydebreck et al 2015 likewise pfbs was detected in drinking water at concentrations as high as 0 3 µg l mdh minnesota department of health 2017 while genx was thought to be a sustainable replacement for pfoa some recent studies have raised growing concerns about its potential adverse effects gomis et al 2018 reported that genx showed higher toxicity for male rats than pfoa wang et al 2017 observed that exposure to hfpo da 1 mg kg body weight induced more extensive hepatomegaly for mice than pfoa the latest assessment from the u s environmental protection agency us epa reported a safe daily ingestion level of 3 10 6 mg genx per kg body weight which is lower than the 2018 level by a factor of 2 7 the hill 2021 genx has been widely detected in rivers impacted by fluorochemical plants in the netherlands germany china and united states with the highest concentrations at 812 86 1 3100 and 4500 ng l respectively brandsma et al 2019 gebbink et al 2017 heydebreck et al 2015 sun et al 2016 the genx concentrations in these drinking water sources far exceeded the us epa s lifetime health advisory level of 70 ng l for the sum of pfoa and pfos in drinking water epa 2016a 2016b a recent study reported that genx was detected in 659 out of 837 private wells surrounding a fluorochemical manufacturing facility in north carolina with the maximum genx concentration reaching 4000 ng l and genx in 207 wells exceeded the state s provisional drinking water health goal of 140 ng l deq north carolina department of environmental quality 2018 to mitigate human exposure researchers have tested various technologies to remove or degrade genx in drinking water for example dixit et al 2021 reported that 221 g l of a strong base anion exchange resin purolite a860 was able to decrease genx levels from 10 µg l to 10 ng l wang et al 2019 compared adsorption of genx by activated carbon ac and ion exchange resins and found that the ira67 resin offered 4 times greater capacity than the best ac tested mantripragada et al 2021 observed that functionalized nanofibers provided a maximum genx removal capacity of 0 6 mmol g while these adsorbents could physically remove genx they do not degrade the chemical moreover the regeneration of these rather expensive materials requires toxic volatile and costly solvents such as methanol and generates large amounts of toxic spent regenerant that requires additional handling and disposal xu et al 2020a destructive techniques such as advanced oxidation and reduction processes have also been investigated in recent years bao et al 2018 olvera vargas et al 2021 pica et al 2019 bao et al 2018 reported that nearly complete genx was reductively degraded after 2 h in a uv sulfite system and 90 of fluoride ions were recovered after 6 h pica et al 2019 reported that boron doped diamond anodes were capable of degrading 60 of genx 4 98 mg l in nanofiltration retentate within 4 h and olvera vargas et al 2021 found that 90 genx was mineralized by electro fenton paired with boron doped diamond information has been very limited on photocatalytic degradation of genx using heterogeneous photocatalysts in a recent work that primarily targeting pfoa duan et al 2020 observed that about 16 of genx c0 50 mg l ph 3 0 was degraded after 120 min of uv 254 nm irradiation and in the presence of boron nitride in addition current photocatalytic practices have been limited to treating bulk water by irradiating large volumes of water photocatalysts mixtures which is not only energy intensive but also requires large volume reactors and equipment due to the high capital and operation costs herkert et al 2020 these technologies may be feasible to degrade high concentrations of pfas but less practical for treatment of large volumes of water containing low concentrations of pfas in a previous work we developed ac supported titanate nanotubes tnts ac through a hydrothermal treatment approach using commercially available ac and tio2 liu et al 2016 tnts ac was able to pre concentrate low concentrations of phenanthrene onto the photoactive surface heterojunctions and subsequently degrade the chemical such adsorptive photocatalysts enable a novel concentrate destroy strategy where the target pfas are pre concentrated from a large volume of water onto a small volume of a photocatalyst and then degraded by irradiation of the pfas bearing solid particles namely instead of applying uv irradiation to a large volume of raw water only a small volume of the solids is subjected to uv light resulting in a significant energy saving however plain tnts ac bear with some critical drawbacks for the treatment of pfas li et al 2020a including 1 the negative surface potential of tnts leads to unfavorable adsorption of pfas anions and 2 the relatively low separation efficiency of photoinduced electron hole e h pairs renders limited photoactivity for both legacy and emerging pfas although detailed information has yet to be explored to improve the performances for pfoa and pfos we doped tnts ac with a small fraction of fe and ga respectively in particular li et al 2020a modified tnts ac with 1 wt of fe2 1 g l ph 3 0 and found that the dopant not only facilitated a heads on adsorption mode of pfoa but also enhanced the subsequent photocatalytic degradation of pfoa with 90 of pre adsorbed pfoa degraded and 62 mineralized in 4 h under uv 254 nm irradiation more recently zhu et al 2021 developed a ga doped tnts ac and found the composite was able to completely adsorb pfos within 10 min and defluorinate 66 2 of the pre sorbed pfos after 4 h of the uv irradiation these prior studies also revealed that the different metal dopants resulted in different material structure and photocatalytic properties and reaction mechanisms for example the introduction of ga created oxygen vacancies that facilitated separation of e h pairs and generation of o2 radicals which effectively degraded pfos while fe doping caused direct decarboxylation of pfoa by h and generation of oh radicals however our preliminary tests showed that fe or ga doped tnts ac photocatalysts were less effective for genx degradation and defluorination bismuth based photocatalysts have been found effective for degrading persistent organic pollutants pops including pfas dong et al 2015 weng et al 2013 song et al 2017 reported that biocl nanosheets were able to defluorinate 59 3 of pfoa after 12 h of uv irradiation and the degradation rate was 1 7 and 14 6 times faster than that of commercial in2o3 and tio2 respectively yang et al 2021 prepared bi5o7i zno heterojunction microspheres and found the material degraded 91 of pfoa after 6 h of visible light irradiation owing to heterojunction structures formed upon calcination at 400 c which also extended the photo response to the visible light region and increased the separation efficiency of e h pairs metallic bi can also act as an excellent cocatalyst to facilitate charge carrier separation of bi3 based photocatalysts dong et al 2014a dong et al 2015 although its role has not been explored for photocatalytic degradation of pfas dong et al 2015 investigated a semimetal organic bi g c3n4 nanohybrid which showed some unique visible light photocatalytic properties when used for no removal the superior photoactivity was ascribed to the surface plasmonic resonance spr endowed by bi metal to enhance visible light harvesting and charge separation while these works have revealed the potential of bi0 bi3 based photocatalysts especially the spr enhanced photocatalytic activity these materials have not been explored for treatment of pfas the overall goal of this study was to develop and test an adsorptive photocatalyst bi tnts ac for enhanced adsorption and subsequent degradation of genx in water the specific objectives were to 1 synthesize the desired catalyst through a two step hydrothermal calcination method 2 measure the adsorption kinetics and capacity of bi tnts ac for genx 3 evaluate the material stability and reusability and 4 elucidate the reaction pathway and the underlying mechanisms for the enhanced photocatalytic activity through detailed material

and evaluation of material effectiveness the experimental solutions were prepared with an initial genx concentration of 100 µg l the adsorption was initiated by adding 0 04 g bi tnts ac to 40 ml of a 100 µg l genx solution with an initial ph of 7 0 0 1 the vials were placed on a rotator 70 rpm at 25 c in the dark duplicate vials were sacrificially sampled at predetermined times upon filtering through a 0 22 μm polyether sulfone pes membrane the filtrates were analyzed for genx remaining adsorption isotherms were measured in a similar manner but the mixtures were equilibrated for 24 h to ensure equilibrium the initial genx concentration was varied i e 0 1 0 4 1 3 5 20 50 80 100 mg l while the dosage of bi tnts ac was kept at 1 g l for comparison the kinetic and equilibrium isotherm tests were also carried out with treated ac and tnts ac following the same experimental protocols note no bi was detected in the supernatant during the kinetics and isotherm experiments 2 5

genx and fluoride to measure the residual solid phase genx concentration the solids were extracted using 20 ml methanol at 80 c for 4 h in a water bath after centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was transferred to a clean vial and then the solids were extracted with another 20 ml of methanol under the same conditions the extractants were then combined and analyzed for genx the total genx recovery was 95 and thus no surrogate is was used during the extraction no fluoride was detected when the solids were washed with 20 ml of a 1 m naoh solution the effect of catalyst dosage on the photodegradation effectiveness were carried out following the same experimental protocol but the material dosage was varied from 1 to 5 g l 2 6 ph effect to evaluate effect of solution ph on the adsorption process experiments were conducted with 3 bi tnts ac the best performing material at a dose of 1 g l and an initial genx concentration of 100 µg l the equilibrium solution ph was 3 5 0

experimental protocols for the adsorption and the subsequent photodegradation were followed and leaching of bi and ti into the aqueous phase was analyzed after each cycle 2 8 roles of uv induced reactive species the contribution of common uv induced reactive species to the photocatalytic degradation of genx was assessed using various scavengers in particular edta isa bq and nan3 were added to experimental mixtures to quench photogenerated holes h hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 respectively van doorslaer et al 2012 the same experimental procedures were followed for the adsorption and photodegradation tests except one of the scavengers was present during the photodegradation at various concentrations 0 5 1 0 5 0 and 10 0 mm the use of the molarity units was to facilitate cross comparison among the scavengers and with literature data for other materials 2 9 density functional theory calculations the fukui functions which are based on the density functional theory dft were employed to predict the attack sites in genx for different radicals using the gaussian 16 c 01 package ji et al 2020 the geometry optimization and single point energy calculations were carried out via the b3lyp method with the 6 31 g d p basis set section s1 in sm provides more details on the dft calculations 2 10 chemical analysis aqueous phase genx concentrations

optical emission spectroscopy icp oes 710 es varian usa with a detection limit of 100 µg l and 50 µg l respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 material phases and chemical composition fig 1 a shows the xrd patterns of calcined tnts ac and bi tnts ac loaded with 1 5 wt bi for tnts ac the diffraction peaks at 10 5 24 4 28 4 and 47 8 are assigned to sodium tri titanate with a chemical formula of na x h2 x ti3o7 x depends on the sodium content wang et al 2018 the basic skeleton of tri titanate was composed of edge sharing triple tio6 octahedrons with na and h attached at the interlayers as exchangeable counter ions ma et al 2017 the intensity of the diffraction peaks of tnts ac were notably decreased compared to those of uncalcined tnts ac and uncalcined 3 bi tnts ac fig s1 which can be attributed to breakage of the tubular and layered structures during calcination razali et al 2012 partial collapse of polymerized ti species ti o ti species and or decrease in isolated ti species with higher coordination numbers yang and li 2002 moreover the xrd diffraction pattern for calcined tnts ac showed a red shift compared to that of uncalcined tnts ac e g from 9 8 to 10 5 fig s1 indicating a decrease in interlayer distance due to the release of water molecules qamar et al 2008 compared to calcined tnts ac and uncalcined bi tnts ac the xrd patterns for calcined bi tnts ac with different bi contents displayed five characteristic peaks with 2θ values of 25 3º 37 8º 48 1º 54 2º and 62 2º corresponding to the 101 004 200 211 and 213 planes of tetragonal anatase jcpds icdd no 21 1272 respectively this result indicates that sodium tri titanate was transformed into anatase due to bi doping and calcination the adsorption of bi3 ions on tnts ac partially replaced na ions which is conducive to the formation of anatase upon calcination cai et al 2017 lee et al 2007 in addition for bi tnts ac fig 1 a the characteristic peaks at 22 5º 27 2º 39 6º 44 6º 46 0º 48 7º 64 5º and 70 8º confirmed the existence of the rhombohedral phase of metallic bi jcpds icdd no 44 1246 in contrast no evidence of metallic bi peaks was observed for uncalcined bi tnts ac fig s1 indicating that the calcination facilitated the reduction of bi3 into bi0 the xps analysis confirmed that bi3 on tnts ac was reduced into bi0 with ac as the electron donor at 550 ºc fig 1 a also indicates that increasing the bi content from 1 wt to 3 wt enhanced the peak intensities of bi whereas further increasing bi to 4 and 5 wt resulted in a lower bi intensity accordingly 3 bi tnts ac demonstrated the highest genx defluorination efficiency section 3 4 and was therefore selected for further testing xps spectra were obtained to examine the chemical composition of bi tnts ac and tnts ac the scans were performed in two ways one on the pristine material surface and the other after ar ion etching at depths of 50 and 150 nm fig s2a confirms the presence of ti c na o and bi on the 3 bi tnts ac surface for the spectra of bi 4f without etching fig 1 b the peaks centered at 164 0 and 158 7 ev are characteristic of bi3 in bismuth oxides and are ascribed to bi 4f5 2 and bi 4f7 2 respectively lan et al 2020 in conjunction with the xrd results which showed no crystalline bi2o3 on bi tnts ac the bi2o3 identified by xps was amorphous the two bi 4f peaks in fig 1 b shifted from 164 0 158 7 ev to lower binding energies of 163 9 158 6 ev with 50 nm etching and 163 6 158 4 ev with 150 nm etching these results can be attributed to the partial reduction of bi3 x species liu et al 2017 two additional peaks were present at 161 6 and 156 3 ev after the 50 nm etching and these peaks were attributed to bi bi bonds and confirmed the presence of metallic bi in the composite yang et al 2020 the bi bi peak intensity was stronger for the 150 nm etching suggesting that more metallic bi was present in the particle core namely the bi particles consisted of a metallic bi core and a thin amorphous bi2o3 shell on the surface of bi tnts ac the binding energies were corrected by the c 1s levels at 284 8 ev as a reference the c 1s spectra fig 1 c measured at the surface of the pristine sample can be deconvoluted into three peaks corresponding to c o 286 0 ev c o 287 2 ev and o c o 289 6 ev bonds which were also present after the 150 nm etching with the exception of o c o bonds gopiraman et al 2017 after the 50 nm etching the oxygenated carbon groups disappeared and two additional peaks occurred at 284 6 ev and 286 6 ev the peak at 284 6 ev highlights the existence of c c groups wang et al 2020 whereas the peak at 286 6 ev was attributed to carbonyl or quinine groups ma et al 2015 in addition the o 1s xps spectra fig s2b highlighted the presence of bi o bonds at 529 7 ev and the regular lattice oxygen ti o ti at 531 3 ev almeida et al 1998 dong et al 2015 the peaks at 458 2 ev and 464 0 ev in fig s2c belong to ti 2p3 2 and ti 2p1 2 respectively which are characteristic of ti4 li et al 2020b 3 2 morphological characterization figs s3a and s3b show the sem images of 3 bi tnts ac calcined at 550 c where the surface displayed a flower like structure with interwoven tnts grafted on the ac petals micro or nano ac particles were attached to well defined tnts figs 2 a and s3b this observation indicates that the hydrothermal treatment under alkaline conditions not only converted tio2 into tnts but also altered the structure of the ac resulting in mutual modification of ac and tnts the eds mapping figs s3c and s3d revealed that five major elements i e c o ti na and bi were uniformly distributed on 3 bi tnts ac and table s3 presents the percentile of each element the high ti 36 2 c 19 2 and bi 5 2 contents corroborate the formation of bi tnts ac figs 2 a 2 c present the tem images of 3 bi tnts ac fig 2 a confirms the hybridization of tnts and ac nanoparticles the coated carbon particles on tnts are beneficial and facilitate hydrophobic interactions with genx and anion π interactions between genx and the electron deficient aromatic skeletons of ac the interlayer distance of tnts was 0 75 nm fig 2 c which agrees with the crystal plane 020 of titanate wang et al 2018 whereas the lattice fringe spacing of 0 35 nm fig 2 b conforms to the 101 plane of anatase prior work on tnts ac showed that no transformation from tri titanate to anatase would occur upon calcination without a metal dopant zhu et al 2021 this observation suggests that bi on tnts facilitated transformation from titanate to anatase while tnts retained its nanotube structure with an inner diameter of 5 nm and an outer diameter of 12 nm fig 2 c in addition the lattice spacing 0 328 nm shown in fig 2 c corresponds to the 012 lattice plane of metallic bi dong et al 2015 which is expected to facilitate electron transfer and inhibit recombination of electron hole pairs section 3 4 fig s4a shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of tnts ac and bi tnts ac with 1 5 wt bi according to the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac classification system all isotherms are type iv and characteristic of mesoporous materials in the low p p0 range the shape of the isotherms conformed to monolayer multilayer adsorption subsequently the h3 type hysteresis loops appeared at around p p0 0 40 suggesting that another adsorption mechanism such as capillary condensation occurred in the nanotubes and or mesoporous channels liu et al 2016 when the bi content was increased from 1 to 5 wt the hysteresis loop became larger which aligns with the capillary condensation mechanism el sheikh et al 2017 fig s4b gives the pore size distribution determined using the bjh method except for tnts ac and 3 bi tnts ac the pore size distributions displayed a bimodal profile with major peaks at 3 7 nm and minor peaks at 8 9 16 0 nm 3 bi tnts ac showed the most uniform pore size distribution of the bi doped composites table s4 summarizes the ssa and pore volume for all materials the ssa of tnts ac was 243 77 m2 g which is lower than that for the ac by a factor of 2 4 indicating partial blockage of the internal pores pore volume also decreased by 2 4 upon the loading of tnts when loaded with 1 2 3 4 and 5 wt of bi the ssa was increased from 243 77 m2 g for tnts ac to 307 50 279 60 289 84 285 26 and 269 78 m2 g respectively the increase in ssa stemmed from pore volume increases table s4 resulting from the bi mediated phase transformation and restructuring of tnts and ac fig s3 subramaniam et al 2017 excessive bi doping resulted in a slight decrease in ssa due to the increased crystal sizes of anatase and metallic bi which partially blocked nanopores table s5 zhong et al 2012 the newly created sites associated with the elevated ssa are expected to not only facilitate genx adsorption but also be more photoactive due to the hybridization of bi tnts and ac 3 3 genx adsorption kinetics and isotherms fig 3 a compares the genx adsorption kinetics of 3 bi tnts ac and its precursor materials ac and tnts ac which were subjected to the same hydrothermal treatment and calcination process the rate of genx adsorption by 3 bi tnts ac was nearly the same as that of the treated ac on an equal mass basis 40 mg and 99 of genx was removed in 1 h with 90 of the removal occurred in the first 10 min tnts ac showed a slower adsorption rate and equilibrium was not reached until 120 min due to the poor affinity of genx to the negatively charged tnts fig s5 shows that when the material dosage was halved to 20 mg 3 bi tnts ac displayed clearly faster adsorption rate than the treated ac the results confirmed that the bi loading notably improved the adsorption rate of genx due to 1 suppression of the negative surface potential of tnts the p h pzc of tnts and 3 bi tnts were 2 6 and 6 3 respectively and 2 lewis acid base interactions between bi and the carboxylate group of genx the pseudo first order eq 1 and pseudo second order eq 2 kinetic models were utilized to interpret the kinetic data 1 q t q e q e exp k 1 t 2 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where q t and q e µg g are the solid phase genx concentrations at time t min and equilibrium respectively and k 1 min 1 and k 2 g µg min are the respective rate constants table s6 summarizes the kinetic parameters for both models the pseudo second order model gave a better goodness of fit as evidence by the r2 0 99 for all three materials however both models can adequately fit the kinetic data the different rate constants are in line with the characterization results that the bi and tnts modifications of the ac along with the hydrothermal and calcination treatments altered accessibility of the adsorption sites because genx concentrations in industrial and contaminated waters can widely vary detailed isotherms were constructed for ac and 3 bi tnts ac over a broad range of equilibrium concentrations namely 0 1 100 mg l fig 3 b the classical langmuir eq 3 and freundlich eq eq 4 isotherm models were tested to fit the experimental data 3 q e q m a x b c e 1 b c e 4 q e k f c e 1 n where qmax mg g is the langmuir maximum capacity b l mg is the langmuir affinity coefficient kf mg g l mg 1 n is the freundlich capacity parameter and n is the heterogeneity factor related to the presence and distribution of different sorption sites table s7 summarizes the parameters for the models based on the coefficients of determination r2 both models were able to adequately fit the experimental data though the freundlich model offered better fitting for ac and tnts ac suggesting a heterogeneous nature in terms of adsorption energy and modes according to the langmuir model the maximum adsorption capacities of genx on ac tnts ac and 3 bi tnts ac were 120 26 79 96 and 101 77 mg g respectively while the ssa of treated ac was about 2 4 times greater than that of 3 bi tnts ac the langmuir maximum capacity of ac was only 1 2 times higher this disproportionality indicates that although the loading of tnts and bi on ac resulted in partial loss of the adsorption sites in the core ac it created a layer of new sites on the ac the new sites consisted of mixed phases of tnts ac particles and bi nanoparticles which enabled a synergized adsorption mechanism and enhanced affinity for genx the enhanced affinity of 3 bi tnts ac for genx can be well revealed when the isotherm data are plotted based on the surface area normalized uptake fig 3 c table s8 and fig s6 shows that the adsorption of genx by 3 bi tnts ac was much more favorable in the lower genx concentration range c e 2 mg l than treated ac and tnts ac the ssa based qmax values mg m2 followed the order of 3 bi tnts ac 0 35 tnts ac 0 33 ac 0 18 treated ac offered higher genx uptake only when the genx concentration is very high ce 2 mg l fig 3 b due to its much larger ssa 591 38 m2 g the enhanced performance of 3 bi tnts ac can be attributed to synergistic adsorption interactions between anionic genx and 3 bi tnts ac i e hydrophobic lewis acid base and anion π interactions whereas only hydrophobic interaction was operative for treated ac and tnts ac thus the improved affinity of bi tnts ac for genx is expected to not only selectively concentrate genx on the photoactive surface sites but also facilitate the subsequent solid phase photocatalytic degradation of genx fig s7 shows the measured zeta potential of 3 bi tnts ac which exhibited a p h pzc of 3 8 hence in the circumneutral ph range the adsorption of genx anions p k a 2 8 by 3 bi tnts ac would not be favorable due to electrostatic repulsion although the loading of bi suppressed the surface negative potential fig s7 while the tail group of genx is not expected to interact with tnts p h pzc 2 6 the bi deposited on the surface of bi tnts ac may react with genx through concurrent electrostatic and lewis acid base interactions between bi3 and the hydrophilic head groups coo of genx khan and siddiqui 2021 liu et al 2015 liu et al 2016 which is in line with the strong adsorption observed at neutral ph the higher genx adsorption by 3 bi tnts ac could also be due to the larger ssa resulting from the mixed phases section 3 2 which enables hydrophobic reactions between the c f chain of genx except one oxygen atom in the carbon chain and the ac surface furthermore anion π interactions may also occur between genx anions and aromatic groups on the ac surface xu et al 2020 the presence of ac and bi in the composite materials therefore enabled cooperative hydrophobic lewis acid base and anion π interactions not only enhanced the adsorption capacity for genx but also facilitated a side on adsorption mode which is conducive to the in situ photochemical degradation of pre adsorbed genx li et al 2020a 3 4 photodegradation of pre concentrated genx on bi tnts ac fig 4 shows the photocatalytic degradation rates of pre adsorbed genx by treated ac tnts ac and bi tnts ac with 1 5 wt bi after 4 h of the uv irradiation almost no genx degradation was observed for ac and tnts ac in contrast bi tnts ac degraded up to 70 0 of the pre concentrated genx with up to 42 7 defluorinated i e conversion of fluorine into fluoride extending the uv irradiation to 6 and 8 h elevated the genx photodegradation to 75 1 and 77 2 and mineralization to 45 3 and 46 1 respectively fig s8 in accord with the material characterization data 3 bi tnts ac exhibited the highest photoactivity for genx excessive bi i e 3 wt may act as recombination centers of the photo generated electrons and holes fig 5 a shows the effect of catalyst dosage 1 2 3 and 5 g l during the adsorption stage on the subsequent photodegradation defluorination of genx under uv irradiation increasing the photocatalyst dosage from 1 to 2 g l improved the 4 h genx degradation and defluorination from 70 0 to 74 1 and from 42 7 to 48 3 respectively however further increasing the dosage to 3 or 5 g l resulted in lower rates of degradation and defluorination which can be attributed to diminished light penetration as a result of elevated shading effects from denser suspended particles and aggregation of the particles ahmadpour et al 2020 mirzaei et al 2018 consequently the dosage of 2 g l was used in the subsequent studies in practice the material dosage should be tuned according to the target water quality conditions different catalyst dosages during the adsorption stage result in adsorption of genx on sites with different accessibility and photoactivity kinetically genx will be loaded on the more easily accessible sites at higher material doses from the photoactivity perspective the hybrid sites with bi tnts ac are more photoactive while the pure ac phase may only adsorb but not degrade genx while most adsorption sites of ac are located inside the particles the main adsorption sites for 3 bi tnts ac are likely to be on the outside shell the differences in adsorption sites were evidenced by the reduced ssa of 3 bi tnts ac compared to the parent ac table s4 the overall degradation efficiency depends on the fraction of genx loaded on the more photoactive sites which are accessible to not only genx but also photons photogenerated charge carriers and reactive oxygen species ros ding et al 2013 section 3 7 in practice the low fraction of non reactive sites should not affect the overall process because this photo inert adsorption capacity will remain constant in each treatment cycle and will not affect genx adsorption and photodegradation on the reactive sites which are automatically regenerated upon the photodegradation 3 5 ph effects on genx adsorption and photodegradation fig 5 b shows the effect of ph on genx adsorption by 3 bi tnts ac nearly all 99 of the genx was consistently adsorbed from the solution over a broad ph range of 3 5 10 upon equilibrium due to the low p k a value 2 8 genx mainly existed in the anionic form in the ph range tested in light of the phpzc of 3 8 for 3 bi tnts ac and 6 3 for bi tnts section 3 3 a negative overall surface potential would be expected for 3 bi tnts ac in the experimental ph range except for ph 3 5 namely electrostatic interactions between genx and 3 bi tnts ac are unfavorable at neutral or alkaline ph at more alkaline ph the surface potential of bi tnts turned more negative p h pzc 6 3 and thus the interaction with the carboxylate group of genx became more unfavorable due to electrostatic repulsion and competition of oh consequently adsorption of genx would largely rely on the hydrophobic and anion π interactions between genx and ac resulting in a vertical tail on orientation adsorption mode li et al 2020a conversely at more acidic ph adsorption of genx becomes more favorable for enhanced electrostatic interaction between the positively charged surface of bi tnts and genx and lewis acid base interaction between genx and the metals i e bi ti in this case genx tends to be adsorbed in the parallel or side on mode with both the head and tail of genx bound to the mixed phases it is noteworthy that the observed no effect of ph on adsorption could also be due to the very high removal of genx in all cases our goal here was to show that 3 bi tnts ac was able to effectively concentrate genx over a broad ph range at practically relevant dosages thus the photodegradation efficiency of genx is evaluated at the five different ph values fig 5 b the 4 h genx photodegradation showed a clear decreasing trend with increasing ph from 78 4 at ph 3 5 to 76 4 74 1 68 0 and 44 8 at ph 5 0 7 0 8 5 and 10 0 respectively apparently the photodegradation effectiveness is associated with the adsorption modes of genx as to be illustrated in sections 3 7 and 3 8 the head group decarboxylation is a critical step in the genx degradation process as such the head on or side on adsorption mode is more favorable than the vertical tail on mode for the photo generated holes and radicals to attack both the head and tail groups of a genx molecule in addition the production of photogenerated holes and radicals can be suppressed under alkaline conditions excessively high ho could react with photogenerated holes to produce excessive oh which inhibit the direct hole oxidation of genx section 3 7 li et al 2020a moreover acidic conditions are favorable for formation of ho2 which is a precursor of h2o2 and oh eq 6 song et al 2012 6 o 2 h ho 2 p k a 4 88 3 6 stability and reusability of bi tnts ac the efficient photodegradation of sorbed genx was expected to automatically regenerate the material for repeated uses to test this hypothesis 3 bi tnts ac was subjected to five consecutive cycles of adsorption and photodegradation after the fifth cycle 3 bi tnts ac was still able to adsorb 98 of the genx from solution fig 5 c indicating that the material retained its adsorption capacity in addition the genx mineralization efficiency only exhibited a modest decrease from 48 3 to 43 7 after the five cycles potentially due to competition from accumulated short chain intermediates produced in previous cycles no loss in ti content was detected and 1 0 wt of the doped bi leached into the solution after the five cycles 3 7 mechanisms of enhanced genx photodegradation by bi tnts ac to understand the roles of common reactive species photocatalytic degradation experiments were carried out in the presence of radical scavengers namely isa for oh bq for o2 edta for the photo generated h and nan3 for 1o2 fig 6 a shows the 4 h photodegradation efficiency for genx in the presence of variable concentrations 0 5 1 5 and 10 mm of isa nan3 bq or edta nan3 and bq showed only modest or negligible effects on the photodegradation indicating that neither o2 nor 1o2 reacted with genx in contrast the photodegradation decreased from 74 1 without a scavenger to 43 0 in the presence of 0 5 mm isa and to 1 5 when the isa concentration was increased to 10 mm indicating that oh played a critical role in the photodegradation process the addition of 0 5 10 mm of edta lowered the genx degradation to 66 9 56 2 suggesting that h also played an important role fig 6 b compares the epr spectra of dmpo oh adducts generated in the tnts ac and 3 bi tnts ac systems after 10 and 20 min of uv irradiation a weaker oh signal four lines with an intensity ratio of nearly 1 2 2 1 was observed for tnts ac while a stronger oh signal was evident after the incorporation of 3 wt bi on tnts ac the oh signal intensity increased with the irradiation time fig 6 b due to the resulting oh no o2 or 1o2 signals were detected for 3 bi tnts ac figs s9a and s9b the results confirmed the findings from the radical quenching experiments fig 6 a fig 6 c compares the optical properties of tnts ac and bi tnts ac with 1 5 wt bi bi tnts ac exhibited greater light absorption than tnts ac throughout the uv and visible ranges 200 800 nm though tnts ac did demonstrate notable light absorbance due to the carbon kakavandi et al 2019 velasco arias et al 2012 in particular the maximum absorbance 285 nm for 3 bi tnts ac was 14 higher than that 310 nm for tnts ac these results confirmed that the bi particles on the surface enhanced light harvesting leading to enhanced photogeneration of electrons and holes this phenomenon is attributed to the spr effect endowed by the metallic bi on tnts ac dong et al 2015 showed that the electromagnetic field distribution of bi spheres reached its maximum at the surface of metallic bi particles and they observed that the spr property of bi could markedly enhance visible light harvesting and charge separation when the surface plasmon wave interacts with a local particle or rough surface some of the energy can be re emitted as light other studies have also demonstrated that bi particles display strong spr effects in the uv range 228 280 nm depending on their particle size and shape dong et al 2014b ma et al 2013 wang et al 2005 for instance ma et al 2013 determined two spr absorption peaks at 228 nm and 256 nm for mixed plate like 40 70 nm and polyhedral 500 nm bi nanocrystals wang et al 2005 synthesized stabilized bismuth nanoparticles 10 nm that showed a surface plasmon absorption peak at 281 nm moreover 3 bi tnts ac also exhibited enhanced visible light absorption which is in agreement with previous reports that bi displayed spr effect in both ultraviolet and visible light domains sun et al 2015 sun et al 2017 pl emission intensity has been used to measure the recombination of photo induced electrons and holes fig s10 shows the pl emission spectra of tnts ac and 3 bi tnts ac while the pl intensity for tnts ac included two large peaks the spectra for 3 bi tnts ac was almost flat indicating that deposition of bi resulted in a remarkable decline in the recombination of electron hole pairs this observation agrees with the notion that metallic bi can serve as an effective electron trap and thus facilitate electron hole separation dong et al 2014a chen et al 2017 prepared bi bi2o3 core shell nanoparticles and found that metallic bi nanoparticles can generate charge carriers due to the spr effect while the amorphous bi2o3 surface layer serves as an efficient electron and hole acceptor to guide the directional transfer of photo charges and enhance the separation of electron hole pairs the bi2o3 shell could also protect the metallic bi core from oxidation which not only preserves the reactive lifetime but also provides a safe environment for photocatalytic reactions chen et al 2017 based on the experimental results and material characterization fig 7 illustrates the key mechanisms governing the enhanced adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of genx by bi tnts ac first the incorporation of bi nanoparticles on bi tnts ac creates a more favorable environment for adsorption due to suppression of the surface negative potential the surface bi along with ti also serves as a lewis acid to bind with the carboxylate group of genx anions which is conducive to the decarboxylation reaction that is often an essential step for pfas degradation zhu et al 2021 second the bi nanoparticles enhance light absorbance fig 6 c favoring the production of photogenerated electrons and holes third due to photo induced spr the metallic bi is photoexcited and promotes excitation of surface electrons generation of more charge carriers and interfacial electron transfer chen et al 2017 fourth because the fermi level vs nhe of metallic bi 0 17 ev dong et al 2015 is lower than the conduction band cb level of tnts ac 0 12 ev dang et al 2020 the photoexcited electrons tend to flow from bi to tnts ac decreasing the recombination rate of electron hole pairs and increasing the lifetime of charge carriers in tnts ac fifth the electron release results in positively charged bin which attract and trap photoexcited electrons from the valence band vb of tnts ac to maintain charge neutrality dong et al 2014a further inhibiting e h recombination and leaving more holes available for reacting with genx lastly the local electromagnetic field representing the spr effects of bi metal can also enhance the generation of electron hole pairs and subsequent separation of the charge carriers tu et al 2015 afterwards the separated electrons will reduce o2 to h2o2 because the redox potential of o2 h2o2 0 695 ev moon et al 2017 is more positive than that of the cb of tnts ac and subsequently h2o2 is transformed into oh by trapping an electron dong et al 2014a given the redox potential of o2 o2 0 33 ev the cb electrons are less likely to react with o2 dong et al 2014a conversely the holes with a redox potential of 3 85 ev can facilitate decarboxylation of genx and oxidation of ho into oh radicals e0 1 99 ev for oh oh dong et al 2014a as oh radicals and h are the major reactive species the photocatalytic degradation of genx adsorbed on bi tnts ac was enhanced fig 8 a shows the molecular structure of genx with labeled sites figs 8 b and 8 c show the highest occupied molecule orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo of genx respectively and indicate that the carboxylate group is a favorable attack site for photogenerated holes and radicals while the gain or loss of electrons on each genx molecule site cannot be accurately obtained ji et al 2020 the condensed fukui functions were calculated based on the natural population analysis npa scheme to identify the electrophilic f nucleophilic f and radical f 0 reactive sites in genx fig 8 d based on the condensed fukui function values of 0 3309 and 0 3273 the most reactive sites for electrophilic attack are o19 and o20 respectively of the carboxylate group the same sites also exhibit the highest f 0 values namely 0 1906 and 0 1981 respectively therefore the carboxylate group of genx is most prone to the attack by the photogenerated radicals which is in agreement with previous reports of photocatalytic degradation of long chain pfas xu et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 the surface contour of f for genx indicates that c1 0 1084 and c2 0 1188 in the cf3cf2cf2 end group are most vulnerable to nucleophilic attack this observation agrees with the report by bao et al 2018 however bao et al 2018 also proposed that the optimal trajectory for radicals to attack the carboxyl group of genx is blocked by cf3 due to steric hindrance pica et al 2019 asserted that oh attack on the ether bond of genx is kinetically unfavorable because of the high activation barrier 321 kj mol though the attack can result in concurrent decarboxylation while the initial oxidative attack does not break the ether bond stepwise mineralization can occur along the acidic side chain moreover the ether bond introduces a weak point in the perfluorinated carbon chain facilitating degradation by hydrated electrons 3 8 pathways of genx photodegradation by bi tnts ac fig s11 shows the chromatograms of two major stable intermediate products tfa cf3cooh and pfa c2f5cooh detected after the 4 h photocatalytic degradation of genx by 3 bi tnts ac other intermediates were either unstable or unidentifiable taken together the mechanism analysis reactive species quenching data dft calculations intermediates and findings from recent studies bao et al 2018 pica et al 2019 vakili et al 2021 the photodegradation of genx by 3 bi tnts ac may occur along two possible pathways fig 9 the first pathway starts with decarboxylation by oh and or h to generate an activated intermediate c5f11o then the c5f11o radical interacts with oh and or h2o to form unstable c3f7ocf3cfoh which subsequently transforms into c3f7ocof after elimination of a cf3 moiety on the α carbon pica et al 2019 upon further reaction with oh c3f7ocof converts into c4f8ho3 and subsequently generates cf3cf2cf2o through cleavage of the fcooh moiety finally cf3cf2cf2o continues to lose the cf2o groups until complete mineralization pica et al 2019 vakili et al 2021 the second pathway is initiated by reduction of the ether group by photogenerated electrons to form c3f7 and c3f4o3 fragments the carboxylate fragment c3f4o3 is degraded in a similar manner as pathway 1 specifically the carboxylate group is cleaved and the active intermediate reacts with oh and or h2o to form the unstable c2f4ooh which is converted to c2f4o after one h2o molecule is eliminated then c2f4o is hydrolyzed to cf3coo tfa with the expulsion of h and f the c3f7 fragment may react with oh or h2o to generate unstable c3f7oh which further transforms into cf3cf2cof upon hydrolysis cf3cf2cof converts into c2f5coo pfa which is converted into c2f5oh upon decarboxylation by oh and h niu et al 2012 the unstable alcohol undergoes intramolecular rearrangement to form cf3cof and converts into cf3coo niu et al 2012 in addition electrons may attack other fluorine atoms in the fluorocarbon tail park et al 2009 song et al 2013 resulting in an alternative pathway for pfa photodegradation where pfa is transformed into cf3ch2coo via h f exchange and subsequently converted into cf3coo upon elimination of a ch2 moiety bao et al 2018 park et al 2009 song et al 2013 the tfa generated from decomposition of the two genx fragments may be further degraded to cf3 and coo the resulting cf3 may combine with other radicals e g cf3 or h to form gaseous products e g cf3h c2f6 bao et al 2018 4 conclusions a new adsorptive photocatalyst was prepared characterized and tested for degradation of genx as a model emerging pfas the major findings are summarized as follows 1 the most reactive bi tnts ac was prepared by depositing 3 wt bi on ac supported titanate nanotubes constructed with commercially available ac and p25 2 material characterization indicated that bi was deposited on the material surface as nanoparticles with a metallic bi core and amorphous bi2o3 shell in addition micro or nanoscale ac particles were also observed on tnts 3 bi tnts ac was able to adsorb nearly all genx in 1 h effectively concentrating genx on the photoactive sites subsequently 70 0 of the pre sorbed genx was degraded including 42 7 defluorinated after 4 h of uv irradiation the photodegradation process also regenerated the material enabling repeated uses without additional chemical regeneration 4 the hybrid bi anatase and ac phases at the microscale or nanoscale facilitated enhanced adsorption of genx through concurrent and synergistic hydrophobic lewis acid base and anion π interactions 5 the spr effect enabled by the metallic bi nanoparticles greatly enhanced light harvesting generation of charge carriers and separation of e h pairs 6 while dft findings suggested that the carboxylate group was the prone to the radical attack in the uv system the ether bond was a favorable attack site for photogenerated electrons 7 oh radicals and photogenerated h were the main reactive species for the photocatalytic degradation of genx by bi tnts ac which starts with cleavage of the carboxylate group conversion to cf3cf2cf2o via decarboxylation and cf3 elimination and continues through sequential loss of cf2o groups until complete mineralization in addition the ether bond in the genx molecule may be attacked by photogenerated electrons opening up another degradation pathway given the widespread use of genx as a substitute for legacy pfas and the growing health concerns bi tnts ac and the concentrate and destroy concept may serve as an important technology for cost effective treatment of genx contaminated waters credit authorship contribution statement yangmo zhu conceptualization methodology software formal analysis

15826,pharmaceutical and illicit drug residues in sewage sludge may present important risks following direct application to agricultural soils potentially resulting in uptake by plants leaching desorption tests were performed on different types of stabilized sewage sludge originating from multiple treatment technologies in the slovak republic acid rain and base rich condition of soil with different ph conditions were simulated to model the effect of widely varying ph ph 2 4 7 9 and 12 on the leaching desorption of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs twenty nine of 93 target analytes were found above the limit of quantification in sludge or associated leachates total desorbed amounts of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs ranged from 810 to 4000 µg kg and 110 to 3600 µg kg of the dry mass of anaerobic and aerobic sludge respectively desorbed fractions were calculated as these values are normalized to initial sludge concentration and therefore were more suitable for qualitative description of the behavior of individual compounds using principal component analysis qualitative analysis of the desorbed fraction confirmed the differences among sludge types pharmaceuticals and desorption ph desorbed fractions could not be related to the octanol water distribution coefficient desorbed fractions also did not reflect the expected ionization of studied molecules unless converted into their relative values generally the lowest mobility was observed within the environmentally relevant ph range of 4 9 and high ph generally resulted in high desorption especially in anaerobically stabilized sludges graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dewatered stabilized sludge wastewater treatment plant anaerobic aerobic mobility 1 introduction management of sewage sludge is a problem of great concern in europe and other parts of the world in fact sewage sludge production in the europe union eu increased from about 10 million tons of dry matter dm in 2003 2006 to 11 5 million tons of dm in 2010 with an estimated 13 5 million tons of dm in 2020 bianchini et al 2016 since the improvement of collection and treatment systems for wastewater in eu countries leads to increased sludge production about 15 million tons of sewage sludge dm are expected to be produced within the next five years this amount represents about 70 million tons of new sludge that needs to be properly treated and disposed therefore it is urgent to find a solution to the problem of sewage sludge disposal which has faced increasing issues in the eu member states in the last few years bianchini et al 2016 đurđević et al 2020 eurostat 2020 havukainen et al 2022 nearly 35 of sludge produced in the eu is estimated to be spread directly for agricultural use and about 12 is used in compost and probably also will be applied to soil in forestry on gardens and city greens more than half of sludge production is composted or applied to land in some countries czech republic lithuania ireland hungary on the other hand no sludge is directly recycled for agriculture in four countries malta netherlands slovenia and slovakia eurostat 2020 ivanova et al 2018 because of the physical chemical processes involved in activated sludge wastewater treatment systems sludge accumulates heavy metals pathogen microorganisms diverse organic compounds e g pahs pcbs and other potential contaminants in the past sludge management activities have primarily been focused on the removal of conventional pollutants which has led to more stringent regulations to restrict the direct use of sewage sludge on soil bianchini et al 2016 european council directive 1986 fytili and zabaniotou 2008 this historical regulation aimed to gradually attenuate metals emissions from production processes such as industrial wastewaters and other commercial activities e g mercury in dental technology as a result metals concentrations in the sludge have decreased over time alloway and jackson 1991 gendebien 2010 metcalf and eddy 1991 with the fast development of analytical methods mainly liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection a new group of micropollutants pharmaceuticals emerged which continues to attract the attention of researchers first studies reported a wide range of pharmaceuticals in sewage and surface water daughton and ternes 1999 hirsch et al 1999 kümmerer 2008 later research aimed to describe the presence and fate of pharmaceuticals in wastewater during the treatment castiglioni et al 2006 golovko et al 2014 khasawneh and palaniandy 2021 li 2014 park et al 2017 priya et al 2022 rout et al 2021 snyder et al 2012 tran and gin 2017 verlicchi and zambello 2015 however data on pharmaceutical concentrations in different types of final sludge from wastewater treatment is scarce in the literature which may have resulted because the sludge is a more complex matrix for analysis gago ferrero et al 2015 golovko et al 2016 peysson and vulliet 2013 pharmaceuticals can occur at high levels in sludge for example ibuprofen 1274 ng g dm citalopram 3300 ng g dm telmisartan 3400 ng g dm fexofenadine 5600 ng g dm ciprofloxacin 6300 ng g dm and norfloxacin 8300 ng g dm ivanova et al 2018 verlicchi and zambello 2015 the amount of these compounds in the final treated effluent discharge can be influenced by their sorption affinity to sludge components horsing et al 2011 and generally depends on the ionization of the molecules under different phs for instance venkatesan and halden 2016 developed a partitioning model to assess the influence of ph on the sorption of ionizable organic contaminants to municipal sewage sludge and based on these modeling results suggested that a sequential ph treatment acidic ph 2 followed by basic ph 12 treatment has the potential to reduce the amount of these compounds in sludge prior to its application to soil it has also been documented e g kim et al 2010 mancuso et al 2019 that alkaline conditions affect sewage sludge disintegration thus it can also be postulated that sludge disintegration can increase the release of these compounds from sewage sludge in addition both effects can differ for sludges resulting from different treatment technologies pharmaceuticals and other organic compounds can potentially leach from soils amended with sewage sludge and subsequently contaminate groundwater or surface water and accumulate in crops ben mordechay et al 2021 ben mordechay et al 2018 clarke and smith 2011 kodesova et al 2019 lapworth et al 2012 wu et al 2010 there is an ongoing discussion on evaluating environmental and human health risks due to the transfer of pharmaceuticals from sludge to the soil groundwater and terrestrial and aquatic trophic levels and crops carter et al 2019 schapira et al 2020 a recent thorough review of pharmaceuticals fate and effects assessment by schwarz et al 2021 showed that most active pharmaceutical ingredients are persistent or highly persistent leading to possible soil accumulation the same paper and earlier contributions by carter and kinney 2018 indicated that the effects of chronic exposure to terrestrial biota from soil contamination are limited compared to aquatic systems since sorption of pharmaceuticals to sludge and soils largely controls their mobility and can also affect their availability for plants and other organisms knowledge of chemical specific sorption behavior both in the sludge itself and subsequently in the soil environment is fundamentally important understanding the different effects of various environmental conditions such as ph on the release of substances from the sludge can also help understand subsequent pharmaceutical behavior after applying sludge to the soil therefore the objective of the presented study was to examine whether widely varying ph ph 2 4 7 9 and 12 influences the leaching desorption of pharmaceuticals from sewage sludge originating from different treatment technologies leaching desorption tests were performed on stabilized sewage sludge from five wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the slovak republic ivanova et al 2018 we specifically tested the hypotheses that trends in desorption of compounds of analogous dissociation will be similar and simultaneously different from the trends for the other groups of compounds in addition results obtained under ph close to soil ph i e between 4 and 9 were used to consider the potential release of measured compounds to other environmental matrices 2 material and methods 2 1 characterization of the investigated sludge and sampling of the sludge sludges from five different wwtps were investigated within the study three of them utilize the anaerobic digestion of sludge and another two use aerobic digestion of sludge the basic characterization of the sludge types is given in table 1 sludge was sampled from containers prepared for transport from wwtps after completed stabilization in february 2017 subsamples approximately 500 ml each day were taken over three days to obtain approximately 1500 ml of sludge for the experiment each sludge sample was homogenized and analyzed in triplicate sample aliquots were frozen 20 c and transported to an analytical laboratory at the faculty of fisheries and water protection of usb in vodňany czech republic 2 2 desorption tests desorption experiments were realized with 50 g of the investigated wet sludge from all wwtps sludge was added to 1000 ml of the water with ph adjusted by the solution of koh 0 5 mol l or hcl 0 5 mol l to the required ph ph 2 4 7 9 12 the suspension was mixed 250 rpm for 1 hour at a horizontal shaker sludge solution was filtered regenerated cellulose filter with pore size 0 45 µm after mixing and water leachate samples were collected and stored frozen 20 c until analysis 2 3 analysis of the sludge and the water samples after desorption ninty three pharmaceuticals illicit drugs and metabolites were selected by their occurrence in wastewater sludge and the potential to elicit adverse effects on aquatic organisms fedorova et al 2022 golovko et al 2016 golovko et al 2014 koba et al 2018 the analytes from collected sludge samples were extracted by a 2 step extraction procedure described in golovko et al 2016 briefly 2 g of dry sludge with the addition of isotopically labeled internal standards were extracted with 4 ml of acetonitrile water 1 1 v v with 0 1 formic acid sonicated for 15 min and the supernatant was filtered through a syringe filter 0 45 μm regenerated cellulose into 10 ml vials the same procedure was repeated in the second step with 4 ml of acetonitrile 2 propanol water 3 3 4 v v v with 0 1 formic acid the sludge extracts were combined and stored in a freezer at 20 c until the lc ms ms analysis after desorption tests isotopically labeled internal standards were added to 10 ml of homogenized and filtered 0 45 μm regenerated cellulose leachate samples were then analyzed according to the inline spe lc ms ms method by lindberg et al 2014 if the ph of the leachates was higher than ph compatible with the inline spe column 11 it was adjusted with formic acid all

provided elsewhere fedorova et al 2013 golovko et al 2016 lindberg et al 2014 2 4 calculations 2 4 1 calculation of the desorbed amount of compound from sludge the desorbed amount of the compound i mi desorbed from dry sludge is the amount of the pharmaceuticals or illicit drugs desorbed from 1 kg of the dry sludge under experimental conditions mentioned in section 2 2 this amount was calculated according to the following equation 1 m i d e s o r b e d ρ i d e s o r b e d w d r y s l u d g e μ g kgdm where ρi desorbed is the measured mass concentration of compound i in the solution under ph 2 4 7 9 12 after desorption process µg l wdry sludge is the mass concentration of dry sludge in solution kg dm l which was calculated assuming mass fraction of total solids in 50 g of tested wet sludge and dry matter content in table 1 and volume of liquid in the solution applied and increased by the fraction of water in the tested 50 g of wet sludge 2 4 2 calculation of desorbed fraction of the investigated compound from the sludge the desorbed fraction of compound i dfi from stabilized sludge under given experimental conditions ph 2 4 7 9 12 was calculated according to the following equation 2 d f i m i d e s o r b e d s i d r y s l u d g e 100 where si dry sludge is the measured initial mass concentration of compound i in dry sludge µg kg in addition relative values of dfi rdfi were calculated by dividing the dfi values by the median evaluated for a particular compound and all conditions i e for all sludges and ph 2 4 3 statistical analysis principle component analysis pca of the dataset on desorbed fractions df and relative desorbed fractions rdf was performed in dell statistica dell inc 2016 data analysis software system version 13 desorbed fractions as a value independent of concentration in sludge are suitable for gaining qualitative information on the pharmaceutical behavior in different sludge types under variable ph we estimated the maximal or minimal desorbed fraction in the values where only sludge or water data were above the limit of quantification loq for those cases where sludge and water concentration of given analyte were below loq no desorbed fraction was calculated only compounds with all variables df and rdf calculated were included in the pca analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 desorption of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs from stabilized sludge twenty nine of 93 target analytes were found at least once in concentrations higher than the loq in the sludge samples or the samples of the water leachate the occurrence and levels of pharmaceuticals in the sludges were discussed in detail in our previous study ivanova et al 2018 we showed differences between anaerobically and aerobically stabilized sludge but no significant difference was found within the groups consequently this follow up work reports the calculated desorbed amounts of drugs as a range for aerobic and anaerobic sludge for different ph the resulting desorbed amounts of compounds per unit of dry sludge mi desorbed are summarized in table 2 we obtained two top five lists comparing the highest median concentration in studied sludges ivanova et al 2018 and those with the highest median release at ph 7 the highest content in sludge was found for fexofenadine verapamil citalopram telmisartan sertraline while the highest desorbed amounts were descending in order telmisartan fexofenadine diclofenac valsartan carbamazepine thc cooh the potential release of studied compounds varied within five orders of magnitude from tens of ng kg dm to hundreds of micrograms kg dm total desorbed amounts of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs ranged from 810 to 4000 µg kg dm and 110 to 3600 µg kg dm for anaerobic and aerobic sludge respectively the maximum values were found at ph 12 the environmentally relevant range ph showed a much lower desorbed amount there are some apparent differences between sludge types and ph 3 2 desorbed fractions of compounds that were initially sorbed in stabilized sludge desorbed fractions dfi calculated using equation 2 for each combination of compound vs wwtp vs ph are reported in table 3 these values are normalized to initial sludge concentration and therefore more suitable for the qualitative description of individual compound behaviors the results are presented as average value standard deviation there are some values significantly exceeding 100 the possible formation of the target compound from metabolites conjugates or complexes can explain elevated dr especially under border ph conditions we used pca of the desorbed fraction dataset to find relationships among chemical individuals sludge and desorption conditions the variables were desorbed fractions of pharmaceuticals in a specific sludge type and at given ph the results of pca are shown in fig 1 according to fig 1 studied pharmaceuticals can be divided into three groups three individual compounds outlaying any group desorbed fractions for mentioned six groups and a group containing compounds excluded from pca number 7 are shown in the boxplot graph in fig 2 where the middle point is median and box borders are minimal and maximal values in the group one important general finding is evident at first sight in fig 2 aerobically stabilized sludges showed lower desorbed fractions within the group than anaerobically stabilized ones this fact is also reflected in fig 1b where desorbed fractions from aerobically stabilized sludges at ph 2 9 are separated from all other variables detailed information on the correlation of the variables with factors principal components is reported in table s1 in supplementary materials principal component 1 strongly negatively correlated 0 70 0 90 with df from all anaerobically stabilized sludges at ph 4 to 9 and all dfs at ph 12 principal component 2 negatively correlated weaker 0 65 0 76 than pc1 with df from aerobically stabilized sludges at ph 4 to 9 compounds in group 1 showed low desorption from all sludge types across the ph range except for ph 12 citalopram sertraline verapamil and fexofenadine were immobile under all conditions with maximal df of 10 for fexofenadine at ph 12 atorvastatin alfuzosin and sulfapyridine were desorbed from the sludges with a rate below 10 in the ph range 2 9 however they became mobile at ph 12 compounds in group 2 valsartan diclofenac metoprolol memantine irbesartan mirtazapine and cetirizine seem more mobile from anaerobic sludges df 9 to 120 under experimental ph range 2 9 than in aerobic ones where df did not exceed 16 the highest df was found for all of these pharmaceuticals at ph 12 the only exception was memantine showing declining df with increasing ph group 3 can be characterized by a minimal desorbed fraction at ph 7 and 9 both extreme acidic and basic conditions stimulated transport to the water phase azithromycin and clindamycin highly exceeded 100 of df in ba dnv and kom sludge at ph 12 while in ba cnt and both aerobically stabilized sludges were at the same ph relatively low 2 38 generally compounds in this group showed diverse desorbed fractions despite the structural similarity with azithromycin clarithromycin was clearly separated from groups 1 3 in fig 1 and was marked as group 4 this compound was highly sorbed and exhibited a long degradation half life in our previous experiments in soils kodesova et al 2015 kodesova et al 2016 results of the sludge experiments in this work confirmed its low mobility even under extreme ph conditions max 35 at ph 12 two other detached pharmaceuticals were carbamazepine group 5 and telmisartan group 6 carbamazepine is a small neutral molecule with low sorption kodesova et al 2015 this soil behavior corresponded to results in our recent study where we found desorption between 30 and 58 across the ph and matrices with one exception in kom anaerobic sludge at ph 12 540 telmisartan appeared in fig 1 as a completely separated from all other compounds this pharmaceutical showed high df in anaerobic sludges under acidic to weakly basic conditions 50 235 while in aerobic ones it was low 8 13 all results from the experiments at ph 12 showed df exceeding 100 we can only speculate the reason for extremely high desorbed fractions we observed them only for a few compounds and always in an anaerobically stabilized sludge at ph 12 however only for telmisartan in all samples we cannot exclude some specific matrix effects following the alkaline digestion of the matrix during the desorption on the other hand the same digestion can convert parent compounds from conjugates metabolites or complexes the paper by van nuijs et al 2015 reported ratios between predicted prescription based and measured loads in wastewater telmisartan showed a relatively low ratio 0 06 0 37 indicating high transformation between excretion 97 of the compound is excreted in unchanged form in humans telmisartan drugs 2022 and wastewater treatment plant influent further transformation can be expected during the treatment process in the recent study by lang et al 2021 many telmisartan metabolites and conjugates were described in cress irrigated with wwtp effluent this phenomenon is worthy of further investigation in the future as there is a lack of information on sludge soil matrix metabolites conversion in recent literature group 7 was excluded from pca analysis because these compounds were present neither in water nor solid phase in all snv and some kom experiments this way we tried to avoid distortion of the pca analysis there are four illicit drugs mdma methadone methamphetamine and thc cooh bisoprolol metoprolol acid and rosuvastatin all compounds were more mobile from anaerobically stabilized sludges than aerobically stabilized ones illicit drug consumption in slovakia showed a general spatial trend of descending consumption from the west to the east mackuľak et al 2016 mackulak et al 2014 the absence of these compounds in sludge from spišská nová ves located in east slovakia can be explained by this trend methadone showed low mobility across the ph range df between 1 and 8 and behaved similarly to group 1 thc cooh desorbed relatively low from all sludge types with maximal values at strong basic conditions which corresponds with acidic properties of this thc metabolite mdma ecstasy was found only in three of five studied matrices and seemed to be medium mobile with no apparent trend within the ph range methamphetamine was desorbed from about 50 in all anaerobically stabilized sludge and 4 5 to 12 in one aerobic sludge rosuvastatin seems to be low mobile with elevated dr at both extreme ph both compounds belonging to cardiac drugs bisoprolol and metoprolol acid are medium mobile and highly mobile with somewhat higher desorption at ph 12 and in some matrices even at ph 2 in summary it was difficult to identify a straight explanation of the grouping factors in the pca analyses as mentioned above the sorption behavior of ionizable compounds can have multiple driving forces the group by pca analysis median values of calculated dfs predicted and experimental octanol water partition coefficients logps drugbank chemaxon predicted values were used and dissociation constants pka drugbank chemaxon predicted values were used are reported in table 4 in addition assuming that trends in desorption of compounds should reflect their ionization venkatesan and halden 2016 measured compounds were according to their pka values divided into six groups a cations and partly neutral pka basic 8 b cations and neutral pka basic 8 c neutral molecules and mostly anions d neutral molecules and anions e cations zwitterions anions f mostly neutral molecules target pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs were ordered by ascending median desorbed fraction for ph range 4 9 compounds with desorbed fractions below 10 can be considered low mobile under the typical soil ph range 4 9 this group includes all pca 1 group compounds methadone and rosuvastatin a high span of logp within this selection illustrates its impropriety for any theoretical estimation of sorption properties for such variable matrix as sludge is despite relatively low desorption compounds highly concentrated in the sludge can contribute significantly to total water pharmaceutical concentration e g fexofenadine among moderately mobile pollutants are compounds with median df between 10 and 20 from pca group 2 and then two illicit drugs metabolites from group 7 mdma and thc cooh clarithromycin group 4 and azithromycin group 3 this group can also be described with elevated release from sludge at some or both border ph values increasing desorption of these compounds especially at ph 12 can be highly important when acidic or basic treatment is used e g lime sanitation schwarz et al 2021 the third group showed df values between 20 and 32 which can be assumed as medium mobility in sludge a significant u shape for df vs experimental ph for most sludge matrices indicates higher desorption at low and high ph however a few exceptions exist for some combinations of drug sludge without any apparent trend the group list included psychoactive drugs venlafaxine tramadol oxazepam codeine and methamphetamine cardiovascular ones metoprolol bisoprolol and valsartan and antibiotic clindamycin carbamazepine telmisartan and metoprolol acid are the most mobile among all studied compounds but with diverse desorption patterns while carbamazepine did not show significant differences among sludge types and ph with one extreme at ph 12 telmisartan df appeared to be consistently elevated at ph 12 with apparently lower desorption from aerobically stabilized sludge metoprolol acid a metabolite of atenolol and metoprolol seems to be more mobile in anaerobically stabilized sludges with increasing ph ionization of the compounds with ph is expectable for telmisartan and metoprolol acid because pka lays within the studied ph range while carbamazepine stays neutral under the same conditions it is not surprising that desorbed fractions are not correlated with logp as illustrated in fig s1 in the supplementary materials however table 4 shows that the pca grouping by df does not correspond to the ionization of the expected compounds thus this comparison again indicates that the magnitude of df values mainly influenced the pca grouping by df 3 3 relative values of desorbed fraction of compound that was initially sorbed in stabilized sludge the relative desorption fractions rdfs df values divided by the median of particular compound df for all conditions were used to compare desorption trends of compounds from a particular group by ionization with different magnitudes of df fig 3 and table s2 supplementary materials shows the median values and standard deviations of rdf calculated for each ph from rdf for all sludges the variability of rdf values for different wwtps was in some cases considerable thus differences between ph treatments were not significant nevertheless the trends of the average values in fig 3 are at least briefly annotated here fig 3 illustrates that trends in the rdf values for a group which are characterized by larger values at ph of 2 and 12 in comparison to those at ph 4 7 and 9 are very similar except for two compounds sertraline and memantine and also differ from the rdf trends for compounds from other groups the larger rdf values may be associated with the lower sorption affinity of positively charged compounds under a very low ph venkatesan and halden 2016 the large rdf values under a ph of 12 could be partly explained by the lower sorption affinity of molecules present under this ph in mostly neutral forms venkatesan and halden 2016 however larger removal of these compounds from sludge is likely associated with the disintegration of sewage sludge under alkaline conditions kim et al 2010 mancuso et al 2019 a similar increase in rdf values at a ph of 12 is visible almost for all compounds except two mostly neutral compounds carbamazepine and oxazepam group f this group noticeably differs from the others because ph had a subtle impact on compounds desorption from sludge the negligible influence of ph on carbamazepine release stands in contrast with the study by wang et al 2018 who observed decreased leaching of carbamazepine from sludge with increasing ph between 5 5 and 11 5 they suggested that the mobility of carbamazepine was dependent on the influence of elevated ph on both the hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding of carbamazepine and dissolved organic matter i e on the impact of ph on dissolved organic matter functional groups and constituents however this effect was likely negligible in the case of ionic compounds another group that was supposed to reveal an evident desorption trend is group c with compounds mostly in an anionic form in this case an increasing trend in desorption with increasing ph was expected venkatesan and halden 2016 in some cases this trend is indicated e g atorvastatin thc cooh but the variability of values is too high to confirm this relationship statistically the behavior of compounds from other groups was even more affected by their various forms under different trends therefore there is even more difficult to observe any trends in their desorption behavior the pca analysis fig s2 in supplementary material for the drf values did not reveal clear groups of compounds as was the case with the df values however this analysis identified group a except sertraline it is also interesting that it showed a similarity in the behavior of compounds from group f oxazepam and carbamazepine to which compounds from group e fexofenadine cetirizine and even telmisartan could also be assigned it should be noted that while in this study desorption behavior of the zwitterionic compounds group e was similar to those in neutral forms group f previous studies focused on the sorption of fexofenadine in seven soils klement et al 2018 schmidtova et al 2020 reported similarity to the behavior of mostly anionic compounds however these two studies also demonstrated similar fexofenadine and irbesartan sorption behaviors group d as indicated in fig 3 and the pca analyses fig s2 in supplementary materials it should also be pointed out that sorption desorption of ionizable compounds can also be highly affected by the presence of other ionic and nonionic compounds in the solution kodesova et al 2020 schmidtova et al 2020 thus desorption of measured compounds could be affected positively due to competition of compounds including chemicals used for ph adjustment for the same sorption sites as well as negatively by their synergic sorption 3 4 implication our study showed that extreme ph values particularly ph of 12 may considerably increase the release of most studied substances therefore technologies based on elevated ph conditions can contribute to the reduction of these substances in the sludge venkatesan and halden 2016 before their application to the soil as also mentioned above both aerobically stabilized sludges generally showed a lower desorbed fraction and total desorbed amount of pharmaceuticals than anaerobic ones unfortunately due to biogas production and subsequent utilization as an energy source anaerobic sludge stabilization is used dominantly in large wwtps above 10 15 thousand pe although large wwtps account for only about 10 15 of the total number of treatment plants in most european countries the amount of sludge processed in these facilities represents more than 70 80 of the total sludge produced bodík and kubaska 2013 đurđević et al 2019 the behavior of pharmaceuticals in anaerobically stabilized sludge thus represents the major part of sludge application onto soils considering the possible release of substances from the sludge after their application e g to the soils the values measured under environmentally relevant ph conditions 4 7 and 9 are the most important assuming a high variability of the rdf values it is impossible to discover any evident trend for particular groups by compound ionization profiles therefore dividing the studied compounds according to their mobility desorbed fraction within this environmentally expected ph range seems more practical and straightforward it allows for a ranking potential release of specific chemicals from applied sludge and hazard for groundwater and aquatic biota six of the ten most mobile compounds according to table 4 order belong to psychoactive compounds which possess biological activity which may not be adequately characterized using traditional acute ecotoxicity assays but have been demonstrated to sublethally affect aquatic invertebrates and vertebrates bláha et al 2019 brodin et al 2013 buric et al 2018 horký et al 2021 hossain et al 2019 hubená et al 2021 santos et al 2021 sehonova et al 2018 the ordering presented in table 4 can be helpful for future risk evaluation of pharmaceuticals leaching and transport to recipients however missing data on pharmaceuticals terrestrial toxicity can lead to underestimating the potential risk of pharmaceuticals in the sediment sludge matrix schwarz et al 2021 following the above knowledge gap compounds with low desorbed fractions cannot be assumed immobile in more complex systems than water sludge high bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals ranked by desorption from sludge as low mobile was reported in spinach growing in soils amended with sewage sludge kodesova et al 2019 for example sertraline the least desorbed compound reached comparable leaf levels as the highly mobile compound carbamazepine in plants that were planted in higher ph soils on the other hand despite its large desorption in the present study telmisartan was found only in roots not in leaves likely due to its positive charge under lower soil ph and its sorption on the root surface another reason can also be its negative charge that can cause its mobility in soils due to repulsion from the soil particle surface but due to the same reason also its entrap after entering the plant cells brunetti et al 2021 2022 developed a theoretical model for predicting the fate of nonionic and ionizable compounds in the soil plant continuum however the transport mechanism of sludge to water immobile compounds to plants needs to be elucidated and included in risk evaluation 4 conclusion as expected we observed the total desorbed amount to follow the total pharmaceutical concentration in the corresponding sludge aerobic stabilization appeared to lead to lower levels in final sludge than anaerobic conditions however anaerobic stabilization remains prevalent in eu countries because of energy recovery the order of pharmaceuticals by the total desorbed amounts did not follow the total sludge concentration order qualitative analysis of the desorbed fractions confirmed the differences among sludge types pharmaceuticals and desorption ph however a prediction of sorption mobility based on the distribution coefficient octanol water and a fraction of organic carbon failed as would be predicted using equilibrium partitioning based approaches for nonionizable organic contaminants burgess et al 2013 in addition the desorbed fractions also directly did not associate with an expected ionization of the compounds unless converted to the relative values i e relative desorbed fractions generally the lowest mobility was observed in the environmental ph range of 4 9 high ph corresponded to generally high desorption especially in anaerobically stabilized sludges consequently using an alkaline treatment for sanitation or other purposes can lead to higher mobility of pharmaceuticals between sludge and water these relatively simple experiments can help prioritize highly mobile compounds as a potential threat to groundwater or surface water however transport to plants was observed for the compounds showing the lowest desorption under such conditions e g sertraline the evaluation scheme for the terrestrial organism needs to involve transport mechanisms not discovered yet unless the potential risk of sludge application onto soils can be underestimated declaration of competing interest the

15826,pharmaceutical and illicit drug residues in sewage sludge may present important risks following direct application to agricultural soils potentially resulting in uptake by plants leaching desorption tests were performed on different types of stabilized sewage sludge originating from multiple treatment technologies in the slovak republic acid rain and base rich condition of soil with different ph conditions were simulated to model the effect of widely varying ph ph 2 4 7 9 and 12 on the leaching desorption of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs twenty nine of 93 target analytes were found above the limit of quantification in sludge or associated leachates total desorbed amounts of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs ranged from 810 to 4000 µg kg and 110 to 3600 µg kg of the dry mass of anaerobic and aerobic sludge respectively desorbed fractions were calculated as these values are normalized to initial sludge concentration and therefore were more suitable for qualitative description of the behavior of individual compounds using principal component analysis qualitative analysis of the desorbed fraction confirmed the differences among sludge types pharmaceuticals and desorption ph desorbed fractions could not be related to the octanol water distribution coefficient desorbed fractions also did not reflect the expected ionization of studied molecules unless converted into their relative values generally the lowest mobility was observed within the environmentally relevant ph range of 4 9 and high ph generally resulted in high desorption especially in anaerobically stabilized sludges graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dewatered stabilized sludge wastewater treatment plant anaerobic aerobic mobility 1 introduction management of sewage sludge is a problem of great concern in europe and other parts of the world in fact sewage sludge production in the europe union eu increased from about 10 million tons of dry matter dm in 2003 2006 to 11 5 million tons of dm in 2010 with an estimated 13 5 million tons of dm in 2020 bianchini et al 2016 since the improvement of collection and treatment systems for wastewater in eu countries leads to increased sludge production about 15 million tons of sewage sludge dm are expected to be produced within the next five years this amount represents about 70 million tons of new sludge that needs to be properly treated and disposed therefore it is urgent to find a solution to the problem of sewage sludge disposal which has faced increasing issues in the eu member states in the last few years bianchini et al 2016 đurđević et al 2020 eurostat 2020 havukainen et al 2022 nearly 35 of sludge produced in the eu is estimated to be spread directly for agricultural use and about 12 is used in compost and probably also will be applied to soil in forestry on gardens and city greens more than half of sludge production is composted or applied to land in some countries czech republic lithuania ireland hungary on the other hand no sludge is directly recycled for agriculture in four countries malta netherlands slovenia and slovakia eurostat 2020 ivanova et al 2018 because of the physical chemical processes involved in activated sludge wastewater treatment systems sludge accumulates heavy metals pathogen microorganisms diverse organic compounds e g pahs pcbs and other potential contaminants in the past sludge management activities have primarily been focused on the removal of conventional pollutants which has led to more stringent regulations to restrict the direct use of sewage sludge on soil bianchini et al 2016 european council directive 1986 fytili and zabaniotou 2008 this historical regulation aimed to gradually attenuate metals emissions from production processes such as industrial wastewaters and other commercial activities e g mercury in dental technology as a result metals concentrations in the sludge have decreased over time alloway and jackson 1991 gendebien 2010 metcalf and eddy 1991 with the fast development of analytical methods mainly liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection a new group of micropollutants pharmaceuticals emerged which continues to attract the attention of researchers first studies reported a wide range of pharmaceuticals in sewage and surface water daughton and ternes 1999 hirsch et al 1999 kümmerer 2008 later research aimed to describe the presence and fate of pharmaceuticals in wastewater during the treatment castiglioni et al 2006 golovko et al 2014 khasawneh and palaniandy 2021 li 2014 park et al 2017 priya et al 2022 rout et al 2021 snyder et al 2012 tran and gin 2017 verlicchi and zambello 2015 however data on pharmaceutical concentrations in different types of final sludge from wastewater treatment is scarce in the literature which may have resulted because the sludge is a more complex matrix for analysis gago ferrero et al 2015 golovko et al 2016 peysson and vulliet 2013 pharmaceuticals can occur at high levels in sludge for example ibuprofen 1274 ng g dm citalopram 3300 ng g dm telmisartan 3400 ng g dm fexofenadine 5600 ng g dm ciprofloxacin 6300 ng g dm and norfloxacin 8300 ng g dm ivanova et al 2018 verlicchi and zambello 2015 the amount of these compounds in the final treated effluent discharge can be influenced by their sorption affinity to sludge components horsing et al 2011 and generally depends on the ionization of the molecules under different phs for instance venkatesan and halden 2016 developed a partitioning model to assess the influence of ph on the sorption of ionizable organic contaminants to municipal sewage sludge and based on these modeling results suggested that a sequential ph treatment acidic ph 2 followed by basic ph 12 treatment has the potential to reduce the amount of these compounds in sludge prior to its application to soil it has also been documented e g kim et al 2010 mancuso et al 2019 that alkaline conditions affect sewage sludge disintegration thus it can also be postulated that sludge disintegration can increase the release of these compounds from sewage sludge in addition both effects can differ for sludges resulting from different treatment technologies pharmaceuticals and other organic compounds can potentially leach from soils amended with sewage sludge and subsequently contaminate groundwater or surface water and accumulate in crops ben mordechay et al 2021 ben mordechay et al 2018 clarke and smith 2011 kodesova et al 2019 lapworth et al 2012 wu et al 2010 there is an ongoing discussion on evaluating environmental and human health risks due to the transfer of pharmaceuticals from sludge to the soil groundwater and terrestrial and aquatic trophic levels and crops carter et al 2019 schapira et al 2020 a recent thorough review of pharmaceuticals fate and effects assessment by schwarz et al 2021 showed that most active pharmaceutical ingredients are persistent or highly persistent leading to possible soil accumulation the same paper and earlier contributions by carter and kinney 2018 indicated that the effects of chronic exposure to terrestrial biota from soil contamination are limited compared to aquatic systems since sorption of pharmaceuticals to sludge and soils largely controls their mobility and can also affect their availability for plants and other organisms knowledge of chemical specific sorption behavior both in the sludge itself and subsequently in the soil environment is fundamentally important understanding the different effects of various environmental conditions such as ph on the release of substances from the sludge can also help understand subsequent pharmaceutical behavior after applying sludge to the soil therefore the objective of the presented study was to examine whether widely varying ph ph 2 4 7 9 and 12 influences the leaching desorption of pharmaceuticals from sewage sludge originating from different treatment technologies leaching desorption tests were performed on stabilized sewage sludge from five wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the slovak republic ivanova et al 2018 we specifically tested the hypotheses that trends in desorption of compounds of analogous dissociation will be similar and simultaneously different from the trends for the other groups of compounds in addition results obtained under ph close to soil ph i e between 4 and 9 were used to consider the potential release of measured compounds to other environmental matrices 2 material and methods 2 1 characterization of the investigated sludge and sampling of the sludge sludges from five different wwtps were investigated within the study three of them utilize the anaerobic digestion of sludge and another two use aerobic digestion of sludge the basic characterization of the sludge types is given in table 1 sludge was sampled from containers prepared for transport from wwtps after completed stabilization in february 2017 subsamples approximately 500 ml each day were taken over three days to obtain approximately 1500 ml of sludge for the experiment each sludge sample was homogenized and analyzed in triplicate sample aliquots were frozen 20 c and transported to an analytical laboratory at the faculty of fisheries and water protection of usb in vodňany czech republic 2 2 desorption tests desorption experiments were realized with 50 g of the investigated wet sludge from all wwtps sludge was added to 1000 ml of the water with ph adjusted by the solution of koh 0 5 mol l or hcl 0 5 mol l to the required ph ph 2 4 7 9 12 the suspension was mixed 250 rpm for 1 hour at a horizontal shaker sludge solution was filtered regenerated cellulose filter with pore size 0 45 µm after mixing and water leachate samples were collected and stored frozen 20 c until analysis 2 3 analysis of the sludge and the water samples after desorption ninty three pharmaceuticals illicit drugs and metabolites were

analytes from collected sludge samples were extracted by a 2 step extraction procedure described in golovko et al 2016 briefly 2 g of dry sludge with the addition of isotopically labeled internal standards were extracted with 4 ml of acetonitrile water 1 1 v v with 0 1 formic acid sonicated for 15 min and the supernatant was filtered through a syringe filter 0 45 μm regenerated cellulose into 10 ml vials the same procedure was repeated in the second step with 4 ml of acetonitrile 2 propanol water 3 3 4 v v v with 0 1 formic acid the sludge extracts were combined and stored in a freezer at 20 c until the lc ms ms analysis after desorption tests isotopically labeled internal standards were added to 10 ml of homogenized and filtered 0 45 μm regenerated cellulose leachate samples were then analyzed according to the inline spe lc ms ms method by lindberg et al 2014 if the ph of the leachates was higher than ph compatible with the inline spe column 11 it was adjusted with formic acid all

provided elsewhere fedorova et al 2013 golovko et al 2016 lindberg et al 2014 2 4 calculations 2 4 1 calculation of the desorbed amount of compound from sludge the desorbed amount of the compound i mi desorbed from dry sludge is the amount of the pharmaceuticals or illicit drugs desorbed from 1 kg of the dry sludge under experimental conditions mentioned in section 2 2 this amount was calculated according to the following equation 1 m i d e s o r b e d ρ i d e s o r b e d w d r y s l u d g e μ g kgdm where ρi desorbed is the measured mass concentration of compound i in the solution under ph 2 4 7 9 12 after desorption process µg l wdry sludge is the mass concentration of dry sludge in solution kg dm l which was calculated assuming mass fraction of total solids in 50 g of tested wet sludge and dry matter content in table 1 and volume of liquid in the solution applied and increased by the fraction of water in the tested 50 g of wet sludge 2 4 2 calculation of desorbed fraction of the investigated compound from the sludge the desorbed fraction of compound i dfi from stabilized sludge under given experimental conditions ph 2 4 7 9 12 was calculated according to the following equation 2 d f i m i d e s o r b e d s i d r y s l u d g e 100 where si dry sludge is the measured initial mass concentration of compound i in dry sludge µg kg in addition relative values of dfi rdfi were calculated by dividing the dfi values by the median evaluated for a particular compound and all conditions i e for all sludges and ph 2 4 3 statistical analysis principle component analysis pca of the dataset on desorbed fractions df and relative desorbed fractions rdf was performed in dell statistica dell inc 2016 data analysis software system version 13 desorbed fractions as a value independent of concentration in sludge are suitable for gaining qualitative information on the pharmaceutical behavior in different sludge types under variable ph we estimated the maximal or minimal desorbed fraction in the values where only sludge or water data were above the limit of quantification loq for those cases where sludge and water concentration of given analyte were below loq no desorbed fraction was calculated only compounds with all variables df and rdf calculated were included in the pca analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 desorption of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs from stabilized sludge twenty nine of 93 target analytes were found at least once in concentrations higher than the loq in the sludge samples or the samples of the water leachate the occurrence and levels of pharmaceuticals in the sludges were discussed in detail in our previous study ivanova et al 2018 we showed differences between anaerobically and aerobically stabilized sludge but no significant difference was found within the groups consequently this follow up work reports the calculated desorbed amounts of drugs as a range for aerobic and anaerobic sludge for different ph the resulting desorbed amounts of compounds per unit of dry sludge mi desorbed are summarized in table 2 we obtained two top five lists comparing the highest median concentration in studied sludges ivanova et al 2018 and those with the highest median release at ph 7 the highest content in sludge was found for fexofenadine verapamil citalopram telmisartan sertraline while the highest desorbed amounts were descending in order telmisartan fexofenadine diclofenac valsartan carbamazepine thc cooh the potential release of studied compounds varied within five orders of magnitude from tens of ng kg dm to hundreds of micrograms kg dm total desorbed amounts of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs ranged from 810 to 4000 µg kg dm and 110 to 3600 µg kg dm for anaerobic and aerobic sludge respectively the maximum values were found at ph 12 the environmentally relevant range ph showed a much lower desorbed amount there are some apparent differences between sludge types and ph 3 2 desorbed fractions of compounds that were initially sorbed in stabilized sludge desorbed fractions dfi calculated using equation 2 for each combination of compound vs wwtp vs ph are reported in table 3 these values are normalized to initial sludge concentration and therefore more suitable for the qualitative description of individual compound behaviors the results are presented as average value standard deviation there are some values significantly exceeding 100 the possible formation of the target compound from metabolites conjugates or complexes can explain elevated dr especially under border ph conditions we used pca of the desorbed fraction dataset to find relationships among chemical individuals sludge and desorption conditions the variables were desorbed fractions of pharmaceuticals in a specific sludge type and at given ph the results of pca are shown in fig 1 according to fig 1 studied pharmaceuticals can be divided into three groups three individual compounds outlaying any group desorbed fractions for mentioned six groups and a group containing compounds excluded from pca number 7 are shown in the boxplot graph in fig 2 where the middle point is median and box borders are minimal and maximal values in the group one important general finding is evident at first sight in fig 2 aerobically stabilized sludges showed lower desorbed fractions within the group than anaerobically stabilized ones this fact is also reflected in fig 1b where desorbed fractions from aerobically stabilized sludges at ph 2 9 are separated from all other variables detailed information on the correlation of the variables with factors principal components is reported in table s1 in supplementary materials principal component 1 strongly negatively correlated 0 70 0 90 with df from all anaerobically stabilized sludges at ph 4 to 9 and all dfs at ph 12 principal component 2 negatively correlated weaker 0 65 0 76 than pc1 with df from aerobically stabilized sludges at ph 4 to 9 compounds in group 1 showed low desorption from all sludge types across the ph range except for ph 12 citalopram sertraline verapamil and fexofenadine were immobile under all conditions with maximal df of 10 for fexofenadine at ph 12 atorvastatin alfuzosin and sulfapyridine were desorbed from the sludges with a rate below 10 in the ph range 2 9 however they became mobile at ph 12 compounds in group 2 valsartan diclofenac metoprolol memantine irbesartan mirtazapine and cetirizine seem more mobile from anaerobic sludges df 9 to 120 under experimental ph range 2 9 than in aerobic ones where df did not exceed 16 the highest df was found for all of these pharmaceuticals at ph 12 the only exception was memantine showing declining df with increasing ph group 3 can be characterized by a minimal desorbed fraction at ph 7 and 9 both extreme acidic and basic conditions stimulated transport to the water phase azithromycin and clindamycin highly exceeded 100 of df in ba dnv and kom sludge at ph 12 while in ba cnt and both aerobically stabilized sludges were at the same ph relatively low 2 38 generally compounds in this group showed diverse desorbed fractions despite the structural similarity with azithromycin clarithromycin was clearly separated from groups 1 3 in fig 1 and was marked as group 4 this compound was highly sorbed and exhibited a long degradation half life in our previous experiments in soils kodesova et al 2015 kodesova et al 2016 results of the sludge experiments in this work confirmed its low mobility even under extreme ph conditions max 35 at ph 12 two other detached pharmaceuticals were carbamazepine group 5 and telmisartan group 6 carbamazepine is a small neutral molecule with low sorption kodesova et al 2015 this soil behavior corresponded to results in our recent study where we found desorption between 30 and 58 across the ph and matrices with one exception in kom anaerobic sludge at ph 12 540 telmisartan appeared in fig 1 as a completely separated from all other compounds this pharmaceutical showed high df in anaerobic sludges under acidic to weakly basic conditions 50 235 while in aerobic ones it was low 8 13 all results from the experiments at ph 12 showed df exceeding 100 we can only speculate the reason for extremely high desorbed fractions we observed them only for a few compounds and always in an anaerobically stabilized sludge at ph 12 however only for telmisartan in all samples we cannot exclude some specific matrix effects following the alkaline digestion of the matrix during the desorption on the other hand the same digestion can convert parent compounds from conjugates metabolites or complexes the paper by van nuijs et al 2015 reported ratios between predicted prescription based and measured loads in wastewater telmisartan showed a relatively low ratio 0 06 0 37 indicating high transformation between excretion 97 of the compound is excreted in unchanged form in humans telmisartan drugs 2022 and wastewater treatment plant influent further transformation can be expected during the treatment process in the recent study by lang et al 2021 many telmisartan metabolites and conjugates were described in cress irrigated with wwtp effluent this phenomenon is worthy of further investigation in the future as there is a lack of information on sludge soil matrix metabolites conversion in recent literature group 7 was excluded from pca analysis because these compounds were present neither in water nor solid phase in all snv and some kom experiments this way we tried to avoid distortion of the pca analysis there are four illicit drugs mdma methadone methamphetamine and thc cooh bisoprolol metoprolol acid and rosuvastatin all compounds were more mobile from anaerobically stabilized sludges than aerobically stabilized ones illicit drug consumption in slovakia showed a general spatial trend of descending consumption from the west to the east mackuľak et al 2016 mackulak et al 2014 the absence of these compounds in sludge from spišská nová ves located in east slovakia can be explained by this trend methadone showed low mobility across the ph range df between 1 and 8 and behaved similarly to group 1 thc cooh desorbed relatively low from all sludge types with maximal values at strong basic conditions which corresponds with acidic properties of this thc metabolite mdma ecstasy was found only in three of five studied matrices and seemed to be medium mobile with no apparent trend within the ph range methamphetamine was desorbed from about 50 in all anaerobically stabilized sludge and 4 5 to 12 in one aerobic sludge rosuvastatin seems to be low mobile with elevated dr at both extreme ph both compounds belonging to cardiac drugs bisoprolol and metoprolol acid are medium mobile and highly mobile with somewhat higher desorption at ph 12 and in some matrices even at ph 2 in summary it was difficult to identify a straight explanation of the grouping factors in the pca analyses as mentioned above the sorption behavior of ionizable compounds can have multiple driving forces the group by pca analysis median values of calculated dfs predicted and experimental octanol water partition coefficients logps drugbank chemaxon predicted values were used and dissociation constants pka drugbank chemaxon predicted values were used are reported in table 4 in addition assuming that trends in desorption of compounds should reflect their ionization venkatesan and halden 2016 measured compounds were according to their pka values divided into six groups a cations and partly neutral pka basic 8 b cations and neutral pka basic 8 c neutral molecules and mostly anions d neutral molecules and anions e cations zwitterions anions f mostly neutral molecules target pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs were ordered by ascending median desorbed fraction for ph range 4 9 compounds with desorbed fractions below 10 can be considered low mobile under the typical soil ph range 4 9 this group includes all pca 1 group compounds methadone and rosuvastatin a high span of logp within this selection illustrates its impropriety for any theoretical estimation of sorption properties for such variable matrix as sludge is despite relatively low desorption compounds highly concentrated in the sludge can contribute significantly to total water pharmaceutical concentration e g fexofenadine among moderately mobile pollutants are compounds with median df between 10 and 20 from pca group 2 and then two illicit drugs metabolites from group 7 mdma and thc cooh clarithromycin group 4 and azithromycin group 3 this group can also be described with elevated release from sludge at some or both border ph values increasing desorption of these compounds especially at ph 12 can be highly important when acidic or basic treatment is used e g lime sanitation schwarz et al 2021 the third group showed df values between 20 and 32 which can be assumed as medium mobility in sludge a significant u shape for df vs experimental ph for most sludge matrices indicates higher desorption at low and high ph however a few exceptions exist for some combinations of drug sludge without any apparent trend the group list included psychoactive drugs venlafaxine tramadol oxazepam codeine and methamphetamine cardiovascular ones metoprolol bisoprolol and valsartan and antibiotic clindamycin carbamazepine telmisartan and metoprolol acid are the most mobile among all studied compounds but with diverse desorption patterns while carbamazepine did not show significant differences among sludge types and ph with one extreme at ph 12 telmisartan df appeared to be consistently elevated at ph 12 with apparently lower desorption from aerobically stabilized sludge metoprolol acid a metabolite of atenolol and metoprolol seems to be more mobile in anaerobically stabilized sludges with increasing ph ionization of the compounds with ph is expectable for telmisartan and metoprolol acid because pka lays within the studied ph range while carbamazepine stays neutral under the same conditions it is not surprising that desorbed fractions are not correlated with logp as illustrated in fig s1 in the supplementary materials however table 4 shows that the pca grouping by df does not correspond to the ionization of the expected compounds thus this comparison again indicates that the magnitude of df values mainly influenced the pca grouping by df 3 3 relative values of desorbed fraction of compound that was initially sorbed in stabilized sludge the relative desorption fractions rdfs df values divided by the median of particular compound df for all conditions were used to compare desorption trends of compounds from a particular group by ionization with different magnitudes of df fig 3 and table s2 supplementary materials shows the median values and standard deviations of rdf calculated for each ph from rdf for all sludges the variability of rdf values for different wwtps was in some cases considerable thus differences between ph treatments were not significant nevertheless the trends of the average values in fig 3 are at least briefly annotated here fig 3 illustrates that trends in the rdf values for a group which are characterized by larger values at ph of 2 and 12 in comparison to those at ph 4 7 and 9 are very similar except for two compounds sertraline and memantine and also differ from the rdf trends for compounds from other groups the larger rdf values may be associated with the lower sorption affinity of positively charged compounds under a very low ph venkatesan and halden 2016 the large rdf values under a ph of 12 could be partly explained by the lower sorption affinity of molecules present under this ph in mostly neutral forms venkatesan and halden 2016 however larger removal of these compounds from sludge is likely associated with the disintegration of sewage sludge under alkaline conditions kim et al 2010 mancuso et al 2019 a similar increase in rdf values at a ph of 12 is visible almost for all compounds except two mostly neutral compounds carbamazepine and oxazepam group f this group noticeably differs from the others because ph had a subtle impact on compounds desorption from sludge the negligible influence of ph on carbamazepine release stands in contrast with the study by wang et al 2018 who observed decreased leaching of carbamazepine from sludge with increasing ph between 5 5 and 11 5 they suggested that the mobility of carbamazepine was dependent on the influence of elevated ph on both the hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding of carbamazepine and dissolved organic matter i e on the impact of ph on dissolved organic matter functional groups and constituents however this effect was likely negligible in the case of ionic compounds another group that was supposed to reveal an evident desorption trend is group c with compounds mostly in an anionic form in this case an increasing trend in desorption with increasing ph was expected venkatesan and halden 2016 in some cases this trend is indicated e g atorvastatin thc cooh but the variability of values is too high to confirm this relationship statistically the behavior of compounds from other groups was even more affected by their various forms under different trends therefore there is even more difficult to observe any trends in their desorption behavior the pca analysis fig s2 in supplementary material for the drf values did not reveal clear groups of compounds as was the case with the df values however this analysis identified group a except sertraline it is also interesting that it showed a similarity in the behavior of compounds from group f oxazepam and carbamazepine to which compounds from group e fexofenadine cetirizine and even telmisartan could also be assigned it should be noted that while in this study desorption behavior of the zwitterionic compounds group e was similar to those in neutral forms group f previous studies focused on the sorption of fexofenadine in seven soils klement et al 2018 schmidtova et al 2020 reported similarity to the behavior of mostly anionic compounds however these two studies also demonstrated similar fexofenadine and irbesartan sorption behaviors group d as indicated in fig 3 and the pca analyses fig s2 in supplementary materials it should also be pointed out that sorption desorption of ionizable compounds can also be highly affected by the presence of other ionic and nonionic compounds in the solution kodesova et al 2020 schmidtova et al 2020 thus desorption of measured compounds could be affected positively due to competition of compounds including chemicals used for ph adjustment for the same sorption sites as well as negatively by their synergic sorption 3 4 implication our study showed that extreme ph values particularly ph of 12 may considerably increase the release of most studied substances therefore technologies based on elevated ph conditions can contribute to the reduction of these substances in the sludge venkatesan and halden 2016 before their application to the soil as also mentioned above both aerobically stabilized sludges generally showed a lower desorbed fraction and total desorbed amount of pharmaceuticals than anaerobic ones unfortunately due to biogas production and subsequent utilization as an energy source anaerobic sludge stabilization is used dominantly in large wwtps above 10 15 thousand pe although large wwtps account for only about 10 15 of the total number of treatment plants in most european countries the amount of sludge processed in these facilities represents more than 70 80 of the total sludge produced bodík and kubaska 2013 đurđević et al 2019 the behavior of pharmaceuticals in anaerobically stabilized sludge thus represents the major part of sludge application onto soils considering the possible release of substances from the sludge after their application e g to the soils the values measured under environmentally relevant ph conditions 4 7 and 9 are the most important assuming a high variability of the rdf values it is impossible to discover any evident trend for particular groups by compound ionization profiles therefore dividing the studied compounds according to their mobility desorbed fraction within this environmentally expected ph range seems more practical and straightforward it allows for a ranking potential release of specific chemicals from applied sludge and hazard for groundwater and aquatic biota six of the ten most mobile compounds according to table 4 order belong to psychoactive compounds which possess biological activity which may not be adequately characterized using traditional acute ecotoxicity assays but have been demonstrated to sublethally affect aquatic invertebrates and vertebrates bláha et al 2019 brodin et al 2013 buric et al 2018 horký et al 2021 hossain et al 2019 hubená et al 2021 santos et al 2021 sehonova et al 2018 the ordering presented in table 4 can be helpful for future risk evaluation of pharmaceuticals leaching and transport to recipients however missing data on pharmaceuticals terrestrial toxicity can lead to underestimating the potential risk of pharmaceuticals in the sediment sludge matrix schwarz et al 2021 following the above knowledge gap compounds with low desorbed fractions cannot be assumed immobile in more complex systems than water sludge high bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals ranked by desorption from sludge as low mobile was reported in spinach growing in soils amended with sewage sludge kodesova et al 2019 for example sertraline the least desorbed compound reached comparable leaf levels as the highly mobile compound carbamazepine in plants that were planted in higher ph soils on the other hand despite its large desorption in the present study telmisartan was found only in roots not in leaves likely due to its positive charge under lower soil ph and its sorption on the root surface another reason can also be its negative charge that can cause its mobility in soils due to repulsion from the soil particle surface but due to the same reason also its entrap after entering the plant cells brunetti et al 2021 2022 developed a theoretical model for predicting the fate of nonionic and ionizable compounds in the soil plant continuum however the transport mechanism of sludge to water immobile compounds to plants needs to be elucidated and included in risk evaluation 4 conclusion as expected we observed the total desorbed amount to follow the total pharmaceutical concentration in the corresponding sludge aerobic stabilization appeared to lead to lower levels in final sludge than anaerobic conditions however anaerobic stabilization remains prevalent in eu countries because of energy recovery the order of pharmaceuticals by the total desorbed amounts did not follow the total sludge concentration order qualitative analysis of the desorbed fractions confirmed the differences among sludge types pharmaceuticals and desorption ph however a prediction of sorption mobility based on the distribution coefficient octanol water and a fraction of organic carbon failed as would be predicted using equilibrium partitioning based approaches for nonionizable organic contaminants burgess et al 2013 in addition the desorbed fractions also directly did not associate with an expected ionization of the compounds unless converted to the relative values i e relative desorbed fractions generally the lowest mobility was observed in the environmental ph range of 4 9 high ph corresponded to generally high desorption especially in anaerobically stabilized sludges consequently using an alkaline treatment for sanitation or other purposes can lead to higher mobility of pharmaceuticals between sludge and water these relatively simple experiments can help prioritize highly mobile compounds as a potential threat to groundwater or surface water however transport to plants was observed for the compounds showing the lowest desorption under such conditions e g sertraline the evaluation scheme for the terrestrial organism needs to involve transport mechanisms not discovered yet unless the potential risk of sludge application onto soils can be underestimated declaration of competing interest the

15827,major seasonal quasi stationary fronts on shelves play an important role in regulating the spatiotemporal variations in the phytoplankton community however knowledge of their effects on the timing and magnitude of spring phytoplankton bloom spb remains limited here based on decadal satellite data 2003 2020 we examine the climatological relationship between the shandong coastal front scf and spb in the yellow sea the results show that the onset of spb occurs either in march 56 of the seasons examined or in april 44 the peak of spb most often occurs in april 56 of the seasons examined or is advanced to march 16 or delayed to may 28 and that the peak ranges from 1 04 to 2 54 mg chl a m 3 the onset of spb matches with lower turbulence particularly when the rate of generation of turbulent kinetic energy tkert reaches zero a higher magnitude of bloom is associated with a greater change in front and a lower tkert the in situ observations along the scf transects in the yellow sea indicate that weakened scf in spring associated with a shallower mixing layer enhances the transport of nutrients from the coastal to the shelf waters weakened frontal structure and atmospheric forcing in spring can further increase the water stability and decrease turbulence in the upper waters the variation in hydrodynamic conditions allows shelf phytoplankton to stay longer in the upper waters with sufficient light and nutrients and consequently generate a chl a peak the results suggest that the seasonal changes in front intensity and structure and turbulence are important prerequisites for initiating spb on the shelf and that further determines the magnitude of spb graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords turbulent kinetic energy shandong coastal front mixed layer critical turbulence chlorophyll a maximum water stability 1 introduction marine phytoplankton are the most important primary producer in the ocean and play an essential role in the cycling of matter and energy flow in marine ecosystems field et al 1998 the spatiotemporal variations in the phytoplankton community in the ocean greatly depend on the property of the water mass in which they live margalef 1997 ocean fronts are defined as narrow zones with intensified horizontal gradients of water properties e g temperature salinity nutrients and act as boundaries separating water masses with different physical and chemical properties belkin 2002 fedorov 1986 the physical mechanism of cross front convergence and strong along front advection can lead to the accumulation of nutrients and phytoplankton biomass at the front and often generate a zone with high primary production olson et al 1994 pingree et al 1975 venables et al 2012 woodson and litvin 2015 therefore fronts have been considered important mesoscale and sub mesoscale physical processes that regulate the spatiotemporal variations in phytoplankton production on shelves acha et al 2015 longhurst 2006 major quasi stationary or seasonally persistent fronts commonly exist on shelves e g the bering sea okhotsk sea north sea and yellow sea belkin et al 2009 the satellite data have identified six persistent thermal fronts in the yellow sea china they develop in autumn peak in winter and fade in summer belkin et al 2009 in winter these fronts become evident between coastal and shelf waters subject to the intrusion of the yellow sea warm current yswc and strong north winds su 2001 field observations in the yellow sea found that winter fronts can distinctly reduce the transport of matter and energy from the coast to the shelf waters wang et al 2013 wei et al 2016 during this period the sediment input and strong mixing pump up sufficient nutrients and generate high turbidity in the yellow sea xie et al 2002 zang et al 2015 nutrients and temperature are regarded as non limiting factors for phytoplankton with their patterns poorly matching that of chlorophyll a chl a while light exhibits intensive limitation fu et al 2009 jin et al 2013 lin et al 2019a in spring the weakened monsoon and faded yswc erode the front huang et al 2010 meanwhile the seasonal change in atmospheric forcing with increased irradiance promotes the growth of phytoplankton and generates a distinct spring phytoplankton bloom spb in the yellow sea jang et al 2013 lin et al 2019a the timing magnitude duration and species composition of spb can significantly impact the production of zooplankton and larval fish in the annual cycle of the pelagic ecosystem carlotti et al 2008 pedersen et al 1999 therefore understanding the characteristics and mechanisms of spb formation is an important topic for predicting the production of marine ecosystems several hypotheses have provided potential mechanisms to explain the formation of spb on shelves e g critical depth critical turbulence and disturbance recovery behrenfeld and boss 2018 gran and braarud 1935 huisman et al 1999 sverdrup 1953 in the hypothesis of critical depth spb might initiate when the upper mixed layer is shallower than the critical depth at which phytoplankton growth balances its respiration losses gran and braarud 1935 sverdrup 1953 in the hypothesis of critical turbulence spb often occurs when turbulent diffusivity is less than critical turbulence which is that the relaxation of turbulent mixing allows phytoplankton to overcome turbulent dilution and aggregate in upper waters to obtain sufficient light huisman et al 1999 taylor and ferrari 2011a further the hypothesis of disturbance recovery mentions that environmental disturbances of various forms e g mixed layer light levels and nutrient availability enable to accelerate phytoplankton division and provide biological potential for their blooms behrenfeld and boss 2018 the premise of these hypotheses is based on the change in the physical or chemical properties of seawater induced by seasonal change the variations in the position and intensity of the front are also caused by seasonal changes in the physical properties of seawater and can produce a marked impact on the depth of the mixed layer and turbulent kinetic energy moreover the horizontal diffusion and upwelling transport of nutrients associated with the change in front structure from winter to spring have been considered important physical forces to support the spb gao et al 2016 lü et al 2010 son et al 2006 thus it is necessary to deeply explore the role of front change in regulating the characteristics of spb the aim of the research is to reveal the role of the shandong coastal front scf and its potential mechanisms on the timing and magnitude of spb here we analysed the climatological relationship between chl a and scf from winter to spring based on 18 year 2003 2020 satellite derived data to detect the effect of front change on the characteristics of spb furthermore three sets of cross front observational data from winter to spring in the yellow sea were used to validate the spatial effects of front change on chl a and environmental factors the relationship among front change the rate of generation of turbulent kinetic energy tkert chl a and environmental factors was analysed the forcing mechanisms of scf and turbulence on the timing and magnitude of spb were discussed based on the related hypotheses to explain the mechanism of spring

trend from winter to spring spb initiates when tkert reaches nearly zero fig 3a the results show that the onset of spb accounted for 56 of the seasons examined in march and 44 in april from 2003 to 2020 the spb magnitude ranged from 1 04 to 2 54 mg chl a m 3 and the occurrence of the chl a peak had a 16 probability in march 56 in april and 28 in may fig 3a the annual chl a peak spb magnitude

were exhibited in coastal waters especially for din fig 4c e in early spring april 2018 the horizontal gradients of sea temperature were weakened and the structure of the front tilted with a shallower

decreased sharply compared with those in january higher nutrients were observed at sites a3 b3 b4 and c2 fig 5c e in late spring may 2014 the horizontal gradients of sea temperature were weakened and a distinct thermocline formed at waters deeper than 30 m fig 6 a the average chl a concentrations in may 1 73 mg m 3 were lower than those in april higher chl a concentrations 2 mg m 3 were mostly distributed in the upper water column 40 m water depth fig 6b in contrast higher nutrient concentrations were observed in the subsurface and in bottom waters which was particularly true for dsi fig 6c e the observations in different months show the changes in frontal structure and chl a which are consistent with the analysis of satellite data and also demonstrate the seasonal pattern of nutrients 3 3 effects of front and turbulence on tsm and light nutrients temperature and light availability are important environmental factors that determine the formation of spb in the yellow sea the spatial variation in tsm concentrations is an important parameter to assess the levels of nutrients and irradiation in the water column in winter tsm concentrations are high in coastal waters 8 99 15 68 mg l 1 matching the high tkert but they decrease sharply in shelf waters 1 10 10 77 mg l 1 i m is generally low 40 μmol photons m 2 s 1 particularly in the frontal zone fig 7 a in spring the spatial pattern of tsm does not change much but the concentrations greatly decrease 1 14 8 09 mg l 1 matching the low tkert consequently a low tsm generates a high i m 80 μmol photons m 2 s 1 environment weak scf lower than 0 10 c km corresponds to the narrows of spatial difference between the coastal and shelf waters fig 7b high chl a is present in the shelf waters which matches low turbulence and high i m 4 discussion the satellite data revealed that the timing and magnitude of spb were highly associated with the seasonal changes in scf and tkert from winter to spring although the observational data came from different years and had an interannual impact on the result the cross front observations in the yellow sea generally show that the changes in front intensity and structure play an important role in the characteristics of spb by regulating mixed layer depth enhancing the spatial transport of nutrients and accumulating phytoplankton here we discuss the possible physical and chemical effects of front on the timing and magnitude of spb in the yellow sea combined with the related hypotheses to explain the mechanism of spb formation in this study the variations in scf and chl a patterns from winter to spring are consistent with previous observations in the yellow sea huang et al 2010 song et al 2020 in winter the two reverse well mixed currents fig 1 yscc and yswc with marked temperature contrast form a typical thermal front scf around the shandong peninsula at water depths of 35 50 m gao et al 2016 wang and liu 2009 wang et al 2012 as a distinct horizontal sst gradient occurred in winter fig 2a f january high chl a concentrations near the front were observed based on satellite chl a fig 2k l and the phenomenon was further verified by winter observations january 2016 in the yellow sea accompanied by high nutrients fig 4b e high chl a on the front was reported in the iroise sea cadier et al 2017 south brazil bight brandini et al 2018 and georges bank mann and lazier 2005 it is considered to be the double effect of the rapid phytoplankton growth rate and physical accumulation of front convergence the physical actions from front convergence and along front advection contribute a favorable condition which contains complementary factors from opposite sides of the front to promote phytoplankton photosynthesis liu et al 2003 savidge 1976 in addition the convergence on the front can physically accumulate phytoplankton and other materials e g plankton and debris which might also promote chl a signals from satellites acha et al 2015 in spring the increased surface heating rate and decreased wind forcing weaken turbulent convection and enhance water stability hu et al 2004 olita et al 2014 as shown in fig 3a the tkert significantly decreased indicating increased water stability from winter to spring meanwhile weakened yscc and yswc and rising temperature induced by atmospheric forcing can reduce the intensity of scf and lead to a relaxed front structure huang et al 2010 jang et al 2013 in this study sst gradients from satellite and observations displayed a loosened isotherm in april and horizontal gradients front in january were gradually replaced by vertical gradients stratification in may figs 2f j 4a 5a and 6a during the time satellite and observational data showed distinctly high chl a concentrations in shelf waters figs 2m o 5b one potential reason is that front convergence could physically accumulate phytoplankton and other materials and the input of those local and allochthonous organic matter possibly contribute to a high chl a signal acha et al 2015 longhurst 2006 besides the shaped structure of front in spring is beneficial for phytoplankton growth the symmetric and baroclinic instability of the front in spring promotes rearrangement of potential vorticity which can lead to a shallower mld and promote the restratification process through the following two step process taylor and ferrari 2011b thomas and ferrari 2008 first the symmetric instability in the front potentially rearranges the surface boundary layer of which is defined as the upper layer with enhanced turbulence taylor and ferrari 2011b later with the development of meanders and eddies baroclinic instability promotes isotherm slumps and therefore suppresses vertical mixing taylor and ferrari 2011b although the increased insolation and reduced winds can enhance stratification the seasonal change strengthens the unstable of the front equilibrium which can accelerate the instability of front and further promote restratification and shallow the mld turbulence weakening and mld shallowing are physically conducive to the accumulation of phytoplankton in the upper waters these spatial variations can decrease the losses of phytoplankton imposed by turbulent diffusion taylor and ferrari 2011a and promote the light conditions for phytoplankton growth hjerne et al 2019 lin et al 2019a in this study the chl a maximum appeared when tkert reached zero fig 3a and a negative relationship between bloom magnitude and tkert p 0 05 r 0 56 in 2003 2020 was identified fig 3b these seasonal variations in physical processes can also redistribute the nutrients and tsm in the water column and replenish the nutrient supply on the shelf waters liu and wang 2013 in winter mineralization of organic matter and strong mixing enrich the nutrient and tsm concentrations in coastal waters in this study nutrients at most sites were well mixed in winter and higher din and dip were observed in coastal waters fig 4c e tsm concentrations were also high in coastal waters fig 7a a high intensity of scf in winter can become a barrier for offshore sediment transport which explains why tsm and nutrients drop sharply near the front gao et al 2016 shi et al 2019 wang et al 2013 the restricted cross frontal transportation resulted in lower tsm and nutrient concentrations in shelf waters than in coastal waters fig 7a in spring the front intensity and structure became weaker and the isotherms tilted from vertical to horizontal figs 5a and 6a the transport of nutrients from coastal to shelf waters is enhanced when front become weak and the process provides more nutrients for phytoplankton growth although the offshore dispersal of sediment is facilitated the low turbulence combined with the blocking effects of the front lead to relatively low tsm in shelf waters fig 7b thus the low tsm with the increased irradiance promotes light availability and i m reached 90 μmol photons m 2 s 1 during spring fig 7b the enhancement of the available light from 20 μmol photons m 2 s 1 to 90 μmol photons m 2 s 1 during winter to spring could lead to an approximately 5 fold phytoplankton growth rate eppley 1972 platt et al 2003 while previous studies also found that a spring bloom occurs when i m reaches 80 μmol photons m 2 s 1 in shelf seas hitchcock and smayda 1977 townsend and spinrad 1986 the absolute thresholds of nutrient limitation for din dip and dsi were 1 μmol l 1 0 1 μmol l 1 and 2 μmol l 1 respectively justić et al 1995 the nutrient concentrations in this study fig 4c e and in previous surveys e g fu et al 2009 jin et al 2013 lin et al 2019a proved that absolute nutrient limitations do not exist in winter besides it has been demonstrated that relative nutrient limitations are absent in the yellow sea in winter fu et al 2009 jin et al 2013 the spb consumes nutrients and leads to low nutrient concentrations in spring fig 5c e while the nutrients supplement from coastal to shelf waters enhanced by the weakened front is beneficial for bloom accordingly the weakening of front promotes changes in abiotic factors which accelerates the phytoplankton division process and therefore impacts bloom characteristics as shown in fig 3c a greater change in front was linked with higher peak values of spb p 0 05 r 0 50 our results support and supplement the mechanisms in the hypotheses of critical depth critical turbulence and disturbance recovery in the hypotheses of critical depth and turbulence the shallowing of mld and the increase in water stability are important prerequisites to ensure the physical aggregation of phytoplankton in the upper ocean to obtain more light for growth the resulting environmental changes consequently accelerate the growth rate of phytoplankton in the upper ocean and realize the formation of spb disturbance recovery hypothesis the seasonal transformation of the front contributes to the completion of the above physical and chemical processes and becomes an important timing for phytoplankton outbreaks in spring 5 conclusions based on decadal satellite data and observations this study illustrated the effects of front on the timing and magnitude of spb in the yellow sea the following conclusions can be drawn the intensity and structure of scf have distinct seasonal changes from winter to spring the timing and magnitude of spb are highly associated with a weakened front and decreased turbulence in spring phytoplankton growth and physical aggregation contribute to increased chl a concentrations at the convergence of the front the change in front intensity and structure combined with atmospheric forcing in spring contributes to a shallow mld and decreases turbulence in the upper waters these changes enable shelf phytoplankton to stay longer in the upper waters and obtain sufficient light and nutrients to generate a chl a maximum thus the intensity of the front and turbulence on a seasonal scale are important parameters in model simulation

15827,major seasonal quasi stationary fronts on shelves play an important role in regulating the spatiotemporal variations in the phytoplankton community however knowledge of their effects on the timing and magnitude of spring phytoplankton bloom spb remains limited here based on decadal satellite data 2003 2020 we examine the climatological relationship between the shandong coastal front scf and spb in the yellow sea the results show that the onset of spb occurs either in march 56 of the seasons examined or in april 44 the peak of spb most often occurs in april 56 of the seasons examined or is advanced to march 16 or delayed to may 28 and that the peak ranges from 1 04 to 2 54 mg chl a m 3 the onset of spb matches with lower turbulence particularly when the rate of generation of turbulent kinetic energy tkert reaches zero a higher magnitude of bloom is associated with a greater change in front and a lower tkert the in situ observations along the scf transects in the yellow sea indicate that weakened scf in spring associated with a shallower mixing layer enhances the transport of nutrients from the coastal to the shelf waters weakened frontal structure and atmospheric forcing in spring can further increase the water stability and decrease turbulence in the upper waters the variation in hydrodynamic conditions allows shelf phytoplankton to stay longer in the upper waters with sufficient light and nutrients and consequently generate a chl a peak the results suggest that the seasonal changes in front intensity and structure and turbulence are important prerequisites for initiating spb on the shelf and that further determines the magnitude of spb graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords turbulent kinetic energy shandong coastal front mixed layer critical turbulence chlorophyll a maximum water stability 1 introduction marine phytoplankton are the most important primary producer in the ocean and play an essential role in the cycling of matter and energy flow in marine ecosystems field et al 1998 the spatiotemporal variations in the phytoplankton community in the ocean greatly depend on the property of the water mass in which they live margalef 1997 ocean fronts are defined as narrow zones with intensified horizontal gradients of water properties e g temperature salinity nutrients and act as boundaries separating water masses with different physical and chemical properties belkin 2002 fedorov 1986 the physical mechanism of cross front convergence and strong along front advection can lead to the accumulation of nutrients and phytoplankton biomass at the front and often generate a zone with high primary production olson et al 1994 pingree et al 1975 venables et al 2012 woodson and litvin 2015 therefore fronts have been considered important mesoscale and sub mesoscale physical processes that regulate the spatiotemporal variations in phytoplankton production on shelves acha et al 2015 longhurst 2006 major quasi stationary or seasonally persistent fronts commonly exist on shelves e g the bering sea okhotsk sea north sea and yellow sea belkin et al 2009 the satellite data have identified six persistent thermal fronts in the yellow sea china they develop in autumn peak in winter and fade in summer belkin et al 2009 in winter these fronts become evident between coastal and shelf waters subject to the intrusion of the yellow sea warm current yswc and strong north winds su 2001 field observations in the yellow sea found that winter fronts can distinctly reduce the transport of matter and energy from the coast to the shelf waters wang et al 2013 wei et al 2016 during this period the sediment input and strong mixing pump up sufficient nutrients and generate high turbidity in the yellow sea xie et al 2002 zang et al 2015 nutrients and temperature are regarded as non limiting factors for phytoplankton with their patterns poorly matching that of chlorophyll a chl a while light exhibits intensive limitation fu et al 2009 jin et al 2013 lin et al 2019a in spring the weakened monsoon and faded yswc erode the front huang et al 2010 meanwhile the seasonal change in atmospheric forcing with increased irradiance promotes the growth of phytoplankton and generates a distinct spring phytoplankton bloom spb in the yellow sea jang et al 2013 lin et al 2019a the timing magnitude duration and species composition of spb can significantly impact the production of zooplankton and larval fish in the annual cycle of the pelagic ecosystem carlotti et al 2008 pedersen et al 1999 therefore understanding the characteristics and mechanisms of spb formation is an important topic for predicting the production of marine ecosystems several hypotheses have provided potential mechanisms to explain the formation of spb on shelves e g critical depth critical turbulence and disturbance recovery behrenfeld and boss 2018 gran and braarud 1935 huisman et al 1999 sverdrup 1953 in the hypothesis of critical depth spb might initiate when the upper mixed layer is shallower than the critical depth at which phytoplankton growth balances its respiration losses gran and braarud 1935 sverdrup 1953 in the hypothesis of critical turbulence spb often occurs when turbulent diffusivity is less than critical turbulence which is that the relaxation of turbulent mixing allows phytoplankton to overcome turbulent dilution and aggregate in upper waters to obtain sufficient light huisman et al 1999 taylor and ferrari 2011a further the hypothesis of disturbance recovery mentions that environmental disturbances of various forms e g mixed layer light levels and nutrient availability enable to accelerate phytoplankton division and provide biological potential for their blooms behrenfeld and boss 2018 the premise of these hypotheses is based on the change in the physical or chemical properties of seawater induced by seasonal change the variations in the position and intensity of the front are also caused by seasonal changes in the physical properties of seawater and can produce a marked impact on the depth of the mixed layer and turbulent kinetic energy moreover the horizontal diffusion and upwelling transport of nutrients associated with the change in front structure from winter to spring have been considered important physical forces to support the spb gao et al 2016 lü et al 2010 son et al 2006 thus it is necessary to deeply explore the role of front change in regulating the characteristics of spb the aim of the research is to reveal the role of the shandong coastal front scf and its potential mechanisms on the timing and magnitude of spb here we analysed the climatological relationship between chl a and scf from winter to spring based on 18 year 2003 2020 satellite derived data to detect the effect of front change on the characteristics of spb furthermore three sets of cross front observational data from winter to spring in the yellow sea were used to validate the spatial effects of front change on chl a and environmental factors the relationship among front change the rate of generation of turbulent kinetic energy tkert chl a and environmental factors was analysed the forcing mechanisms of scf and turbulence on the timing and magnitude of spb were discussed based on the related hypotheses to explain the mechanism of spring

a2 and b3 fig 4a corresponding to the scf position at water depths of 35 50 m fig 2f g higher chl a concentrations were observed in coastal waters site a1 0 91 1 64 mg m 3 and the frontal zone site b2 1 23 1 77 mg m 3 lower chl a concentrations were observed in shelf waters 1 mg m 3 fig 4b nutrient concentrations were vertically homogeneous in the water column and higher nutrient concentrations were exhibited in coastal waters especially for din fig 4c e in early spring april 2018 the horizontal gradients of sea temperature were weakened and the structure of the front tilted with a shallower mld at transects a and b but it was still distinct at transect c fig 5 a the average chl a concentrations at the three transects 2 73 1 79 mg m 3 increased remarkably compared with those in winter 0

decreased sharply compared with those in january higher nutrients were observed at sites a3 b3 b4 and c2 fig 5c e in late spring may 2014 the horizontal gradients of sea temperature were weakened and a distinct thermocline formed at waters deeper than 30 m fig 6 a the average chl a concentrations in may 1 73 mg m 3 were lower than those in april higher chl a concentrations 2 mg m 3 were mostly distributed in the upper water column 40 m water depth fig 6b in contrast higher nutrient concentrations were observed in the subsurface and in bottom waters which was particularly true for dsi fig 6c e the observations in different months show the changes in frontal structure and chl a which are consistent with the analysis of satellite data and also demonstrate the seasonal pattern of nutrients 3 3 effects of front and turbulence on tsm and light nutrients temperature and light availability are important environmental factors that determine the formation of spb in the yellow sea the spatial variation in tsm concentrations is an important parameter to assess the levels of nutrients and irradiation in the water column in winter tsm concentrations are high in coastal waters 8 99 15 68 mg l 1 matching the high tkert but they decrease sharply in shelf waters 1 10 10 77 mg l 1 i m is generally low 40 μmol photons m 2 s 1 particularly in the frontal zone fig 7 a in spring the spatial pattern of tsm does not change much but the concentrations greatly decrease 1 14 8 09 mg l 1 matching the low tkert consequently a low tsm generates a high i m 80 μmol photons m 2 s 1 environment weak scf lower than 0 10 c km corresponds to the narrows of spatial difference between the coastal and shelf waters fig 7b high chl a is present in the shelf waters which matches low turbulence and high i m 4 discussion the satellite data revealed that the timing and magnitude of spb were highly associated with the seasonal changes in scf and tkert from winter to spring although the observational data came from different years and had an interannual impact on the result the cross front observations in the yellow sea generally show that the changes in front intensity and structure play an important role in the characteristics of spb by regulating mixed layer depth enhancing the spatial transport of nutrients and accumulating phytoplankton here we discuss the possible physical and chemical effects of front on the timing and magnitude of spb in the yellow sea combined with the related hypotheses to explain the mechanism of spb formation in this study the variations in scf and chl a patterns from winter to spring are consistent with previous observations in the yellow sea huang et al 2010 song et al 2020 in winter the two reverse well mixed currents fig 1 yscc and yswc with marked temperature contrast form a typical thermal front scf around the shandong peninsula at water depths of 35 50 m gao et al 2016 wang and liu 2009 wang et al 2012 as a distinct horizontal sst gradient occurred in winter fig 2a f january high chl a concentrations near the front were observed based on satellite chl a fig 2k l and the phenomenon was further verified by winter observations january 2016 in the yellow sea accompanied by high nutrients fig 4b e high chl a on the front was reported in the iroise sea cadier et al 2017 south brazil bight brandini et al 2018 and georges bank mann and lazier 2005 it is considered to be the double effect of the rapid phytoplankton growth rate and physical accumulation of front convergence the physical actions from front convergence and along front advection contribute a favorable condition which contains complementary factors from opposite sides of the front to promote phytoplankton photosynthesis liu et al 2003 savidge 1976 in addition the convergence on the front can physically accumulate phytoplankton and other materials e g plankton and debris which might also promote chl a signals from satellites acha et al 2015 in spring the increased surface heating rate and decreased wind forcing weaken turbulent convection and enhance water stability hu et al 2004 olita et al 2014 as shown in fig 3a the tkert significantly decreased indicating increased water stability from winter to spring meanwhile weakened yscc and yswc and rising temperature induced by atmospheric forcing can reduce the intensity of scf and lead to a relaxed front structure huang et al 2010 jang et al 2013 in this study sst gradients from satellite and observations displayed a loosened isotherm in april and horizontal gradients front in january were gradually replaced by vertical gradients stratification in may figs 2f j 4a 5a and 6a during the time satellite and observational data showed distinctly high chl a concentrations in shelf waters figs 2m o 5b one potential reason is that front convergence could physically accumulate phytoplankton and other materials and the input of those local and allochthonous organic matter possibly contribute to a high chl a signal acha et al 2015 longhurst 2006 besides the shaped structure of front in spring is beneficial for phytoplankton growth the symmetric and baroclinic instability of the front in spring promotes rearrangement of potential vorticity which can lead to a shallower mld and promote the restratification process through the following two step process taylor and ferrari 2011b thomas and ferrari 2008 first the symmetric instability in the front potentially rearranges the surface boundary layer of which is defined as the upper layer with enhanced turbulence taylor and ferrari 2011b later with the development of meanders and eddies baroclinic instability promotes isotherm slumps and therefore suppresses vertical mixing taylor and ferrari 2011b although the increased insolation and reduced winds can enhance stratification the seasonal change strengthens the unstable of the front equilibrium which can accelerate the instability of front and further promote restratification and shallow the mld turbulence weakening and mld shallowing are physically conducive to the accumulation of phytoplankton in the upper waters these spatial variations can decrease the losses of phytoplankton imposed by turbulent diffusion taylor and ferrari 2011a and promote the light conditions for phytoplankton growth hjerne et al 2019 lin et al 2019a in this study the chl a maximum appeared when tkert reached zero fig 3a and a negative relationship between bloom magnitude and tkert p 0 05 r 0 56 in 2003 2020 was identified fig 3b these seasonal variations in physical processes can also redistribute the nutrients and tsm in the water column and replenish the nutrient supply on the shelf waters liu and wang 2013 in winter mineralization of organic matter and strong mixing enrich the nutrient and tsm concentrations in coastal waters in this study nutrients at most sites were well mixed in winter and higher din and dip were observed in coastal waters fig 4c e tsm concentrations were also high in coastal waters fig 7a a high intensity of scf in winter can become a barrier for offshore sediment transport which explains why tsm and nutrients drop sharply near the front gao et al 2016 shi et al 2019 wang et al 2013 the restricted cross frontal transportation resulted in lower tsm and nutrient concentrations in shelf waters than in coastal waters fig 7a in spring the front intensity and structure became weaker and the isotherms tilted from vertical to horizontal figs 5a and 6a the transport of nutrients from coastal to shelf waters is enhanced when front become weak and the process provides more nutrients for phytoplankton growth although the offshore dispersal of sediment is facilitated the low turbulence combined with the blocking effects of the front lead to relatively low tsm in shelf waters fig 7b thus the low tsm with the increased irradiance promotes light availability and i m reached 90 μmol photons m 2 s 1 during spring fig 7b the enhancement of the available light from 20 μmol photons m 2 s 1 to 90 μmol photons m 2 s 1 during winter to spring could lead to an approximately 5 fold phytoplankton growth rate eppley 1972 platt et al 2003 while previous studies also found that a spring bloom occurs when i m reaches 80 μmol photons m 2 s 1 in shelf seas hitchcock and smayda 1977 townsend and spinrad 1986 the absolute thresholds of nutrient limitation for din dip and dsi were 1 μmol l 1 0 1 μmol l 1 and 2 μmol l 1 respectively justić et al 1995 the nutrient concentrations in this study fig 4c e and in previous surveys e g fu et al 2009 jin et al 2013 lin et al 2019a proved that absolute nutrient limitations do not exist in winter besides it has been demonstrated that relative nutrient limitations are absent in the yellow sea in winter fu et al 2009 jin et al 2013 the spb consumes nutrients and leads to low nutrient concentrations in spring fig 5c e while the nutrients supplement from coastal to shelf waters enhanced by the weakened front is beneficial for bloom accordingly the weakening of front promotes changes in abiotic factors which accelerates the phytoplankton division process and therefore impacts bloom characteristics as shown in fig 3c a greater change in front was linked with higher peak values of spb p 0 05 r 0 50 our results support and supplement the mechanisms in the hypotheses of critical depth critical turbulence and disturbance recovery in the hypotheses of critical depth and turbulence the shallowing of mld and the increase in water stability are important prerequisites to ensure the physical aggregation of phytoplankton in the upper ocean to obtain more light for growth the resulting environmental changes consequently accelerate the growth rate of phytoplankton in the upper ocean and realize the formation of spb disturbance recovery hypothesis the seasonal transformation of the front contributes to the completion of the above physical and chemical processes and becomes an important timing for phytoplankton outbreaks in spring 5 conclusions based on decadal satellite data and observations this study illustrated the effects of front on the timing and magnitude of spb in the yellow sea the following conclusions can be drawn the intensity and structure of scf have distinct seasonal changes from winter to spring the timing and magnitude of spb are highly associated with a weakened front and decreased turbulence in spring phytoplankton growth and physical aggregation contribute to increased chl a concentrations at the convergence of the front the change in front intensity and structure combined with atmospheric forcing in spring contributes to a shallow mld and decreases turbulence in the upper waters these changes enable shelf phytoplankton to stay longer in the upper waters and obtain sufficient light and nutrients to generate a chl a maximum thus the intensity of the front and turbulence on a seasonal scale are important parameters in model simulation

15828,in comparison with the middle and high latitude regions the low latitude regions are less associated with the occurrence of 2 methylisoborneol mib episodes since most of the previously identified mib producers favor moderate low light temperature conditions here we report a serious mib outbreak over the period from jul 2018 to jun 2019 in a low latitude reservoir with a mean annual water temperature of 25 6 c the mib episode lasted for a long period from jul 2018 to jan 2019 and planktothricoides raciborskii was confirmed to be the main mib producer the growth characteristics of p raciborskii were explored through both laboratory culturing and on site verification experiments the results indicated that this strain was not nutrient sensitive at tn 800 μg l 1 and tp 10 μg l 1 but favored moderate light intensity 54 μmol photon m 2 s 1 and high temperature 30 c the two bloom forming genera limnothrix and aphanizomenon favoring lower temperature and similar or relatively higher light intensity showed much greater proliferation about 13 folds limnothrix and 58 folds aphanizomenon from dec to jun by contrast the high water temperature 29 9 2 8 c and light intensity 189 1 87 6 μmol photon m 2 s 1 from jul to nov were not favorable to limnothrix or aphanizomenon which might have created an opportunity for the growth of mib producing p raciborskii in addition we also found that high temperature could promote the release of mib from p raciborskii cells therefore exerting increased pressure on drinking water treatment processes graphical abstract graphical abstract

pseudanabaena sp izaguirre and taylor 1998 zhang et al 2016 and phormidium sp yagi 1988 etc in drinking water reservoirs these species tend to grow in the mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes or reservoirs where the density of blooming cyanobacteria is normally not so high as to restrict their growth jüttner and watson 2007 su et al 2015 watson et al 2008 they prefer to live in subsurface or deep layers of the water column where the nutrient availability is high halstvedt et al 2007 su et al 2015 wood et al 2001 in addition to nutrients light availability and water temperature have also been considered to be key environmental factors affecting their growth jia et al 2019 paerl and otten 2013 the optimum light intensity and temperature for typical mib producing cyanobacteria including pseudanabaena sp fachb1277 25 μmol photon m 2 s 1 and 25 c zhang et al 2016 anabaena sp fachb1384 10 60 μmol photon m 2 s 1 and 21 8 25 9 c oh et al 2017 and microcoleus vaginatus 17 μmol photon m 2 s

it has been reported that the growth of pseudanabaena sp fachb1277 was inhibited at light intensities above 55 μmol photon m 2 s 1or temperatures above 30 c zhang et al 2020 wang and li 2015 observed that the growth rate of pseudanabaena sp dqh15 dropped markedly above 30 μmol photon m 2 s 1 this could explain why mib episodes are mainly observed in the middle latitude regions where even in summer the surface solar radiation is usually lower than 150 μmol photon m 2 s 1 and the water temperature is below 30 c ha et al 2015 jia et al 2019 wu et al 2021 however mib episodes have recently been observed in several low latitude regions pham et al 2021 rong et al 2018 sh et al 2017 where in summer the surface solar radiation is usually higher than 500 μmol photon m 2 s 1 li et al 2013 and the water temperature can exceed 30 c bordet et al 2017 the low latitude fh reservoir 22 20 n 113 33 e for example has been suffering from mib problems for several years the surface water temperature is about 30 c and the light intensity is around 200 μmol photon m 2 s 1 in summer in this reservoir gao et al 2018 wu et al 2021 which are not suitable for the growth of typical mib producing cyanobacteria thus it is interesting to know why mib episodes could occur in such a low latitude reservoir in this study the variations in the phytoplankton communities as well as the mib concentrations and major environmental parameters were revealed based on a monthly field investigation over a period from jul 2018 to jun 2019 an overlooked cyanobacterial strain planktothricoides raciborskii was isolated from the reservoir and identified to be the mib producer based upon a culturing experiment and mib synthesis gene verification the growth and mib production features of this isolated strain were explored through laboratory culturing and on site verification experiments this study can strengthen our understanding of the driving forces for the growth of the mib producing cyanobacteria in low latitude regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and field investigation fh reservoir a subtropical mesotrophic reservoir in a coastal city zhuhai supplies source water 1

extracellular mib ratios being a little higher suggesting that the lab experimental results could reflect the field situation to some extent 4 discussion 4 1 driving forces for the growth of p raciborskii in fh reservoir p raciborskii was identified as the main mib producer in fh reservoir p raciborskii was moved out from the genus planktothrix based on fatty acid composition and 16s rdna sequence information in 2002 suda et al 2002 four recorded instances were reported for the planktothricoides genus in freshwater systems including a hot spring in east africa dadheech et al 2013 fish ponds and reservoirs in southeast asia tawong 2017 te et al 2017 and spatial investigation in china wu et al 2008 the global distribution patterns of p raciborskii suggest that this strain may favor high light intensity and water temperature here we investigated the major driving forces via culturing experiments and field verification most reported mib producing strains including pseudanabaena sp fachb1277 25 c microcoleus vaginatus 25 c and anabaena sp fachb1384 21 8 25 9 c exhibit a mild optimum temperature alghanmi et al 2018 gao et al 2018 oh et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 while pseudanabaena sp dqh15 exhibited a preference for much lower temperatures 10 c wang and li 2015 at the same time most of the mib producing strains favor a relatively low light intensity the optimum light intensities for pseudanabaena planktothrix and anabaena were 27 μmol photon m 2 s 1 36 μmol photon m 2 s 1 and 10 μmol photon m 2 s 1 respectively gao et al 2018 jia et al 2019 wang and li 2015 thus the high mean annual water temperature 25 6 c and surface light intensity 146 0 μmol photon m 2 s 1 in this reservoir do not favor the growth of most of the previously reported mib producers as summarized in table 4 p raciborskii exhibited the highest optimum temperature 30 c and light intensity 54 μmol photon m 2 s 1 among the mib producing strains though light inhibition occurred at a light intensity of 81 μmol photon m 2 s 1 it should not be a serious challenge for p raciborskii since it has gas vesicles to facilitate its movement up and down in the water column cai et al 2020 further this reservoir is well mixed as indicated by temperature differences of 1 5 2 2 c between surface and bottom layer and other parameters during jul to sep p values 0 050 table s4 hence unresisted nutrient transport within the water column and constantly high water temperature guaranteed relatively high primary production and in turn consumed lots of nutrients and resulted in relative low nutrient condition tn 717 307 μg l 1 tp 55 38 μg l 1 however p raciborskii could grow well under the low nutrient condition tn 800 μg l 1 tp 10 μg l 1 according to the culture experiment suggesting that the nutrient conditions in fh reservoir were not the limiting factor for this strain thus p raciborskii might be one of the very few mib producers that can adapt to the environmental conditions of fh reservoir significant seasonality was observed in the p raciborskii abundance and mib concentration in fh reservoir the abundance of p raciborskii kept increasing from jul to nov 2018 figure s3 and the mib episode lasted for about 7 months from jul 2018 to jan 2019 while most reported mib episodes in the mid latitude regions usually only last for several weeks su et al 2015 wu et al 2021 zuo et al 2010 we speculate that the competition succession between the two dominant bloom forming strains limnothrix and aphanizomenon and p raciborskii may have played an essential role the abundances of limnothrix and aphanizomenon were much lower during the mib episode compared with the other seasons p value 0 001 figure s2b limnothrix prefers relatively low light intensity according to a field study of limnothrix redekei as it was more competitive under light limitation rucker et al 1997 and light inhibition was observed for limnothrix fachb1088 at the light intensity of fh reservoir 135 μmol photons m 2s 1 figure s7 in addition the optimal temperature for limnothrix was around 20 c nicklisch 1989 and high temperature 30 c was reported to greatly promote its cell lysis kitazaki et al 2013 moustaka gouni et al 2007 found that limnothrix redekei dominated in winter where the abundance was significantly negatively correlated with water temperature likewise the optimal temperature of aphanizomenon is lower than 20 c a gracile 15 16 c a flos aquae 20 c casero et al 2014 preußel et al 2009 a flos aquae was replaced by microcystis aeruginosa in dianchi lake in summer when the temperature was relatively high therefore the high water temperature 29 9 2 8 c and light intensity 189 1 87 6 μmol photon m 2 s 1 from jul to nov were not friendly to limnothrix and aphanizomenon which might have created an opportunity for the growth of mib producing p raciborskii a similar result was obtained for the succession between surface living microcystis and subsurface living planktothrix in miyun reservoir where the planktothrix quickly proliferated after the microcystis bloom receded su et al 2019 4 2 mib production characteristics p raciborskii has a mib productivity quota of 0 15 0 22 0 02 pg cell 1 which is higher than that of pseudanabaena 0 008 pg cell 1 zhang et al 2016 and planktothrix 0 085 pg cell 1 su et al 2015 but lower than phormidium 0 2 0 7 pg cell 1 li et al 2012 the mib productivity quota for p raciborskii increased with light intensity in this study which was in accordance with those for planktothrix jia et al 2019 and phormidium li et al 2012 meanwhile high temperature may promote the mib production of p raciborskii according to this study table 3 which is also supported by the mib synthesis gene expression test result for pseudanabaena limnetica kakimoto et al 2014 in comparison the mib productivity quota of pseudanabaena sp fachb1277 was relatively higher at 10 c and 35 c compared with other sets 15 20 25 30 c zhang et al 2016 and pseudanabaena sp dqh15 also exhibited the highest mib productivity quota at 35 c wang and li 2015 these results show that the mib productivity quota is negatively correlated with the cell growth rate we speculate that the calculated mib productivity quota may be overestimated due to mib accumulation and low cell density when the environment is hostile figure s9 and the mib productivity quota was determined using only the peak value at the end of the logarithmic growth period in those investigations jia et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 however in this study the calculation was optimized by considering the whole logarithmic growth period variation in mib and cell density and the results indicated that the mib productivity quota could also be positively correlated with cell growth and especially with temperature the extracellular ratio of mib is a very important parameter for mib control in waterworks the cellular mib can be removed along with algal cells while the extracellular mib can only be removed through activated carbon adsorption or ozonation li et al 2018 wert et al 2014 our results suggest high light intensity and temperature promote mib release by p raciborskii table 3 the extracellular mib ratio value at 20 c was meaningless since inhibition of p raciborskii s growth occurred other mib producing cyanobacteria strains exhibited similar patterns from 25 17 μmol photon m 2 s 1 to 66 250 μmol photon m 2 s 1 for planktothrix jia et al 2019 from 38 3 56 9 10 μmol photon m 2 s 1 to 53 9 78 6 60 μmol photon m 2 s 1 for pseudanabaena sp dqh15 wang and li 2015 from 26 10 μmol photon m 2 s 1 to 68 85 μmol photon m 2 s 1 for pseudanabaena sp fachb1277 zhang et al 2016 and from 41 4 17 μmol photon m 2 s 1 to 56 9 50 μmol photon m 2 s 1 for microcoleus vaginatus alghanmi et al 2018 besides a higher extracellular mib ratio was observed at 35 c compared to 27 c for dolichospermum spiroides zhang et al 2017 these results indicate that the mib episodes in low latitude regions are more difficult to treat in drinking water plants because of the high extracellular mib ratio suggesting that in situ control of mib producers in the reservoirs is preferred jia et al 2019 su et al 2017 2021a 4 3 environmental implications mib episodes caused by cyanobacteria in drinking water reservoirs are more common in mid latitude regions izaguirre and taylor 1998 su et al 2015 sugiura et al 1998 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 while the driving forces for the mib producing cyanobacteria in low latitude reservoirs have not been well understood in this study an mib episode in a low latitude drinking water reservoir was investigated the filamentous cyanobacteria strain planktothricoides raciborskii was isolated and identified as the main mib producer based on culturing experiments and in situ verification the physiological characteristics of p raciborskii were explored our results indicated that p raciborskii was not sensitive to the nutrient concentration but favored high water temperature 30 c and moderate light intensity 54 μmol photon m 2 s 1 the relatively low abundance of major competitors including bloom forming limnothrix and aphanizomenon during jul to nov might have created an opportunity for the continuous growth of p raciborskii in addition high water temperature promoted the extracellular release of mib posing a greater risk to water treatment plants in low latitude reservoirs this study could also provide scientific basis regarding the prevention and or control of mib producing p raciborskii in source water reservoirs 5 conclusion in this study a mib episode in a low latitude drinking water reservoir was investigated filamentous cyanobacteria strain planktothricoides raciborskii was isolated and identified as the main mib producer in this reservoir based on the culturing experiments and in situ verification the physiological characteristics of p raciborskii was explored and the following conclusions can be drawn 1 p raciborskii could grow under a low nutrient condition tn 800 μg l 1 tp 10 μg l 1 but favored moderate light intensity 54 μmol photon m 2 s 1 and high temperature 30 c 2 the long period of high temperature might have inhibited the growth of the bloom forming limnothrix and aphanizomenon creating the opportunity for the continuous growth of p raciborskii 3 the mib synthesis and extracellular release could be enhanced by high light and temperature posing a greater risk to water plants in low latitude regions declaration of competing interest the authors declare

15828,in comparison with the middle and high latitude regions the low latitude regions are less associated with the occurrence of 2 methylisoborneol mib episodes since most of the previously identified mib producers favor moderate low light temperature conditions here we report a serious mib outbreak over the period from jul 2018 to jun 2019 in a low latitude reservoir with a mean annual water temperature of 25 6 c the mib episode lasted for a long period from jul 2018 to jan 2019 and planktothricoides raciborskii was confirmed to be the main mib producer the growth characteristics of p raciborskii were explored through both laboratory culturing and on site verification experiments the results indicated that this strain was not nutrient sensitive at tn 800 μg l 1 and tp 10 μg l 1 but favored moderate light intensity 54 μmol photon m 2 s 1 and high temperature 30 c the two bloom forming genera limnothrix and aphanizomenon favoring lower temperature and similar or relatively higher light intensity showed much greater proliferation about 13 folds limnothrix and 58 folds aphanizomenon from dec to jun by contrast the high water temperature 29 9 2 8 c and light intensity 189 1 87 6 μmol photon m 2 s 1 from jul to nov were not favorable to limnothrix or aphanizomenon which might have created an opportunity for the growth of mib producing p raciborskii in addition we also found that high temperature could promote the release of mib from p raciborskii cells therefore exerting increased pressure on drinking water treatment processes graphical abstract graphical abstract

reservoirs where the density of blooming cyanobacteria is normally not so high as to restrict their growth jüttner and watson 2007 su et al 2015 watson et al 2008 they prefer to live in subsurface or deep layers of the water column where the nutrient availability is high halstvedt et al 2007 su et al 2015 wood et al 2001 in addition to nutrients light availability and water temperature have also been considered to be key environmental factors affecting their growth jia et al 2019 paerl and otten 2013 the optimum light intensity and temperature for typical mib producing cyanobacteria including pseudanabaena sp fachb1277 25 μmol photon m 2 s 1 and 25 c zhang et al 2016 anabaena sp fachb1384 10 60 μmol photon m 2 s 1 and 21 8 25 9 c oh et al 2017 and microcoleus vaginatus 17 μmol photon m 2 s

it has been reported that the growth of pseudanabaena sp fachb1277 was inhibited at light intensities above 55 μmol photon m 2 s 1or temperatures above 30 c zhang et al 2020 wang and li 2015 observed that the growth rate of pseudanabaena sp dqh15 dropped markedly above 30 μmol photon m 2 s 1 this could explain why mib episodes are mainly observed in the middle latitude regions where even in summer the surface solar radiation is usually lower than 150 μmol photon m 2 s 1 and the water temperature is below 30 c ha et al 2015 jia et al 2019 wu et al 2021 however mib episodes have recently been observed in several low latitude regions pham et al 2021 rong et al 2018 sh et al 2017 where in summer the surface solar radiation is usually higher than 500 μmol photon m 2 s 1 li et al 2013 and the water temperature can exceed 30 c bordet et al 2017 the low latitude fh reservoir 22 20 n 113 33 e for example has been suffering from mib problems for several years the surface water temperature is about 30 c and the light intensity is around 200 μmol photon m 2 s 1 in summer in this reservoir gao et al 2018 wu et al 2021 which are not suitable for the growth of typical mib producing cyanobacteria thus it is interesting to know why mib episodes could occur in such a low latitude reservoir in this study the variations in the phytoplankton communities as well as the mib concentrations and major environmental parameters were revealed based on a monthly field investigation over a period from jul 2018 to jun 2019 an overlooked cyanobacterial strain planktothricoides raciborskii was isolated from the reservoir and identified to be the mib producer based upon a culturing experiment and mib synthesis gene verification the growth and mib production features of this isolated strain were explored through laboratory culturing and on site verification experiments this study can strengthen our understanding of the driving forces for the growth of the mib producing cyanobacteria in low latitude regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and field investigation fh reservoir a subtropical mesotrophic reservoir in a coastal city zhuhai supplies source water 1

community a total of 57 genera were collected in fh reservoir over the investigation period from jul 2018 to jun 2019 the dominant genera belonged to chlorophyta n 21 cyanophyta 15 and bacillariophyta 11 with the other 10 genera belonging to dinophyta 4 chrysophya 3 euglenophyta 2 and cryptophyta 1 respectively cyanobacteria dominated the phytoplankton community accounting for 93 5 iqr 7 2 in cell density more than 96 of cell density was contributed by the top 10 genera including aphanizomenon 45 79 limnothrix 36 49 microcystis 8 10 pseudanabaena 4 42 anabaena 1 00 chlorella 0 62 peridinium 0

then low mib concentrations lasted for nearly 5 months until the end of the study 3 0 2 3 ng l 1 as shown in table 2 aphanizomenon exhibited the highest correlation coefficient r2 0 40 p value 0 001 with the mib concentration followed by limnothrix r2 0 27 p value 0 001 however these two genera were unlikely to be the mib producers because of their high false negative ratios 63 3 and 42 2 peridinium ankistrodesmus and cryptomonas were also excluded due to their low correlation coefficients 0 07 0 05 0 09 and high false ratios 39 5 52 3 58 6 p raciborskii was the only valid candidate with a relatively high correlation coefficient r2 0 20 p value 0 040 fig 2b and low false ratios fp 4 8 fn 14 3 subsequently we isolated several filamentous strains for further verification showing that p raciborskii was the mib producer according to cellular morphological features 16s rrna gene sequence and mib synthesis gene sequence figure s4 in addition the mib synthesis gene was detected in the reservoir water and its sequence indicated that mib was only produced by p raciborskii but not others including actinomycetes table s5 p raciborskii exhibited a similar seasonal pattern to mib figure s3 it was almost not observed in jul 2018 the cell density increased rapidly from 8 82 8 08 104 cells l 1 in aug 2018 to 425 67 788 35 104 cells l 1 in sep following a slight decrease in oct 139 34 103 19 104 cells l 1 the highest abundance of p raciborskii was obtained in nov 535 44 325 31 104 cells l 1 then the cell density decreased to 35 28 44 06 104 cell l 1 in dec and remained at a very low level during the rest period 8 93 11 15 104 cells l 1 jan jun 2019 3 4 growth characteristics of isolated p raciborskii p raciborskii exhibited similar growth patterns in terms of cell density under two nutrient conditions p value 0 0059 fig 3 a exponential growth started on day 6 lnp 21 60 11 76 106 cell l 1 hnp 23 36 4 88 106 cells l 1 and ended on day 12 lnp 119 09 21 98 106 cells l 1 hnp 163 03 12 90 106 cells l 1 both sets demonstrated rapid declines from day 16 lnp 87 7 hnp 73 3 the specific growth rate of the hnp set 0 33 0 05 d 1 in the logarithmic phase was only slightly higher than that of the lnp set lnp 0 31 0 10 d 1 p value 0 792 table 3 the maximum cell density increased from 110 78 24 04 106 to 165 43 34 44 106 and 192 21 7 33 106 cells l 1 with the increase in light intensity from 13 5 to 27 0 and 54 0 μmol photon m 2 s 1 respectively but decreased to 102 66 20 07 106 cells l 1 at 81 μmol photon m 2 s 1 fig 3b showing that p raciborskii favors moderate light intensities the specific growth rates in the logarithmic phase were 0 24 0 22 0 28 0 07 0 40 0 04 and 0 30 0 04 d 1 respectively for the 4 light intensity conditions p raciborskii was sensitive to low temperature as shown in fig 3c it hardly grew at 20 c and the specific growth rate increased from 0 19 0 14 d 1 to 0 28 0 07 d 1 when the temperature was increased from 20 c to 30 c table 3 3 5 effects of environmental factors on mib production both the dissolved and total mib concentrations showed an increasing trend for all sets over the incubation time figure s5a s5b the high temperature set 30 c was the first to show an increase in the mib concentration on day 7 by contrast the mib concentration kept at a low level for the low temperature set 20 c the extracellular mib ratio changed continuously over the incubation time figure s5c as shown in table 3 the total mib productivity quota at lnp 0 22 0 02 pg cell 1 was significantly higher than that at hnp 0 15 0 02 pg cell 1 p value 0 0086 although no significant difference was observed for both total and extracellular mib concentrations between the two sets p values 0 7920 0 9325 the extracellular mib ratios dmib tmib were 37 3 6 6 and 47 2 10 9 for the lnp and hnp sets p value 0 2479 respectively no significant difference was observed for the cellular mib yield 0 15 0 03 0 19 0 01 pg cell 1 between different light conditions p value 0 1528 the extracellular mib ratio increased from 37 3 4 2 to 57 3 8 9 with the increase in light intensity from 13 5 to 81 μmol photons m 2 s 1 temperature showed significant effects on the cellular mib yield of p raciborskii p value 0 0001 the highest mib yield was obtained for the high temperature set 0 21 0 01 pg cell 1 followed by the middle 0 15 0 02 pg cell 1 and low temperature sets 0 01 0 01 pg cell 1 the extracellular mib was also highest for the high temperature set 75 7 11 5 3 6 growth features of p raciborskii confirmed in field culture experiment as shown in fig 4 a and figure s6 p raciborskii grew normally in the upper three layers 0 5 m 1 5 m 2 5 m corresponding to light intensities of 92 6 20 7 and 4 6 μmol photons m 2 s 1 entering the logarithmic growth phase on day 6 with cell densities of 5 33 5 89 106 cell l 1 3 65 2 99 106 cell l 1 2 22 0 66 106 cell l 1 respectively the cell densities on day 13 reached up to 21 55 4 72 106 cell l 1 13 49 3 38 106 cell l 1 and 8 63 6 66 106 cell l 1 the specific growth rates of p raciborskii in the upper three layers were slightly different 0 5 m 0 26 0 17 d 1 1 5 m 0 23 0 11 d 1 2 5 m 0 17 0 15 d 1 p value 0 455 table s2 and figure s6b by contrast growth in the lower two layers 4 m and 6 m was not observed due to low light intensity the total mib concentrations on day 13 were 3553 3 ng l 1 1389 5 ng l 1 1007 5 ng l 1 6 8 ng l 1 and 12 5 ng l 1 for the 5 layers from 0 5 m to 6 m the cellular mib yields of the top three layers were 0 23 0 06 pg cell 1 0 5 m 0 13 0 03 pg cell 1 1 5 m and 0 09 0 12 pg cell 1 2 5 m respectively with extracellular mib ratios of 83 1 6 4 85 0 14 7 and 67 5 14 8 the specific growth rate mib productivity quota and extracellular mib ratio of p raciborskii in lab experiment with light intensity similar to the depth of these top 3 layers were 81 μmol photons m 2 s 1 0 30 0 04 d 1 0 19 0 01 pg cell 1 57 3 8 9 27 μmol photons m 2 s 1 0 28 0 07 d 1 0 15 0 02 pg cell 1 39 9 12 6 13 5 μmol photons m 2 s 1 0 24 0 22 d 1 0 15 0 03 pg cell 1 37 3 4 2 the specific growth rates and mib yields were equivalent to those obtained in the lab experiment with the extracellular mib ratios being a little higher suggesting that the lab experimental results could reflect the field situation to some extent 4 discussion 4 1 driving forces for the growth of p raciborskii in fh reservoir p raciborskii was identified as the main mib producer in fh reservoir p raciborskii was moved out from the genus planktothrix based on fatty acid composition and 16s rdna sequence information in 2002 suda et al 2002 four recorded instances were reported for the planktothricoides genus in freshwater systems including a hot spring in east africa dadheech et al 2013 fish ponds and reservoirs in southeast asia tawong 2017 te et al 2017 and spatial investigation in china wu et al 2008 the global distribution patterns of p raciborskii suggest that this strain may favor high light intensity and water temperature here we investigated the major driving forces via culturing experiments and field verification most reported mib producing strains including pseudanabaena sp fachb1277 25 c microcoleus vaginatus 25 c and anabaena sp fachb1384 21 8 25 9 c exhibit a mild optimum temperature alghanmi et al 2018 gao et al 2018 oh et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 while pseudanabaena sp dqh15 exhibited a preference for much lower temperatures 10 c wang and li 2015 at the same time most of the mib producing strains favor a relatively low light intensity the optimum light intensities for pseudanabaena planktothrix and anabaena were 27 μmol photon m 2 s 1 36 μmol photon m 2 s 1 and 10 μmol photon m 2 s 1 respectively gao et al 2018 jia et al 2019 wang and li 2015 thus the high mean annual water temperature 25 6 c and surface light intensity 146 0 μmol photon m 2 s 1 in this reservoir do not favor the growth of most of the previously reported mib producers as summarized in table 4 p raciborskii exhibited the highest optimum temperature 30 c and light intensity 54 μmol photon m 2 s 1 among the mib producing strains though light inhibition occurred at a light intensity of 81 μmol photon m 2 s 1 it should not be a serious challenge for p raciborskii since it has gas vesicles to facilitate its movement up and down in the water column cai et al 2020 further this reservoir is well mixed as indicated by temperature differences of 1 5 2 2 c between surface and bottom layer and other parameters during jul to sep p values 0 050 table s4 hence unresisted nutrient transport within the water column and constantly high water temperature guaranteed relatively high primary production and in turn consumed lots of nutrients and resulted in relative low nutrient condition tn 717 307 μg l 1 tp 55 38 μg l 1 however p raciborskii could grow well under the low nutrient condition tn 800 μg l 1 tp 10 μg l 1 according to the culture experiment suggesting that the nutrient conditions in fh reservoir were not the limiting factor for this strain thus p raciborskii might be one of the very few mib producers that can adapt to the environmental conditions of fh reservoir significant seasonality was observed in the p raciborskii abundance and mib concentration in fh reservoir the abundance of p raciborskii kept increasing from jul to nov 2018 figure s3 and the mib episode lasted for about 7 months from jul 2018 to jan 2019 while most reported mib episodes in the mid latitude regions usually only last for several weeks su et al 2015 wu et al 2021 zuo et al 2010 we speculate that the competition succession between the two dominant bloom forming strains limnothrix and aphanizomenon and p raciborskii may have played an essential role the abundances of limnothrix and aphanizomenon were much lower during the mib episode compared with the other seasons p value 0 001 figure s2b limnothrix prefers relatively low light intensity according to a field study of limnothrix redekei as it was more competitive under light limitation rucker et al 1997 and light inhibition was observed for limnothrix fachb1088 at the light intensity of fh reservoir 135 μmol photons m 2s 1 figure s7 in addition the optimal temperature for limnothrix was around 20 c nicklisch 1989 and high temperature 30 c was reported to greatly promote its cell lysis kitazaki et al 2013 moustaka gouni et al 2007 found that limnothrix redekei dominated in winter where the abundance was significantly negatively correlated with water temperature likewise the optimal temperature of aphanizomenon is lower than 20 c a gracile 15 16 c a flos aquae 20 c casero et al 2014 preußel et al 2009 a flos aquae was replaced by microcystis aeruginosa in dianchi lake in summer when the temperature was relatively high therefore the high water temperature 29 9 2 8 c and light intensity 189 1 87 6 μmol photon m 2 s 1 from jul to nov were not friendly to limnothrix and aphanizomenon which might have created an opportunity for the growth of mib producing p raciborskii a similar result was obtained for the succession between surface living microcystis and subsurface living planktothrix in miyun reservoir where the planktothrix quickly proliferated after the microcystis bloom receded su et al 2019 4 2 mib production characteristics p raciborskii has a mib productivity quota of 0 15 0 22 0 02 pg cell 1 which is higher than that of pseudanabaena 0 008 pg cell 1 zhang et al 2016 and planktothrix 0 085 pg cell 1 su et al 2015 but lower than phormidium 0 2 0 7 pg cell 1 li et al 2012 the mib productivity quota for p raciborskii increased with light intensity in this study which was in accordance with those for planktothrix jia et al 2019 and phormidium li et al 2012 meanwhile high temperature may promote the mib production of p raciborskii according to this study table 3 which is also supported by the mib synthesis gene expression test result for pseudanabaena limnetica kakimoto et al 2014 in comparison the mib productivity quota of pseudanabaena sp fachb1277 was relatively higher at 10 c and 35 c compared with other sets 15 20 25 30 c zhang et al 2016 and pseudanabaena sp dqh15 also exhibited the highest mib productivity quota at 35 c wang and li 2015 these results show that the mib productivity quota is negatively correlated with the cell growth rate we speculate that the calculated mib productivity quota may be overestimated due to mib accumulation and low cell density when the environment is hostile figure s9 and the mib productivity quota was determined using only the peak value at the end of the logarithmic growth period in those investigations jia et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 however in this study the calculation was optimized by considering the whole logarithmic growth period variation in mib and cell density and the results indicated that the mib productivity quota could also be positively correlated with cell growth and especially with temperature the extracellular ratio of mib is a very important parameter for mib control in waterworks the cellular mib can be removed along with algal cells while the extracellular mib can only be removed through activated carbon adsorption or ozonation li et al 2018 wert et al 2014 our results suggest high light intensity and temperature promote mib release by p raciborskii table 3 the extracellular mib ratio value at 20 c was meaningless since inhibition of p raciborskii s growth occurred other mib producing cyanobacteria strains exhibited similar patterns from 25 17 μmol photon m 2 s 1 to 66 250 μmol photon m 2 s 1 for planktothrix jia et al 2019 from 38 3 56 9 10 μmol photon m 2 s 1 to 53 9 78 6 60 μmol photon m 2 s 1 for pseudanabaena sp dqh15 wang and li 2015 from 26 10 μmol photon m 2 s 1 to 68 85 μmol photon m 2 s 1 for pseudanabaena sp fachb1277 zhang et al 2016 and from 41 4 17 μmol photon m 2 s 1 to 56 9 50 μmol photon m 2 s 1 for microcoleus vaginatus alghanmi et al 2018 besides a higher extracellular mib ratio was observed at 35 c compared to 27 c for dolichospermum spiroides zhang et al 2017 these results indicate that the mib episodes in low latitude regions are more difficult to treat in drinking water plants because of the high extracellular mib ratio suggesting that in situ control of mib producers in the reservoirs is preferred jia et al 2019 su et al 2017 2021a 4 3 environmental implications mib episodes caused by cyanobacteria in drinking water reservoirs are more common in mid latitude regions izaguirre and taylor 1998 su et al 2015 sugiura et al 1998 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 while the driving forces for the mib producing cyanobacteria in low latitude reservoirs have not been well understood in this study an mib episode in a low latitude drinking water reservoir was investigated the filamentous cyanobacteria strain planktothricoides raciborskii was isolated and identified as the main mib producer based on culturing experiments and in situ verification the physiological characteristics of p raciborskii were explored our results indicated that p raciborskii was not sensitive to the nutrient concentration but favored high water temperature 30 c and moderate light intensity 54 μmol photon m 2 s 1 the relatively low abundance of major competitors including bloom forming limnothrix and aphanizomenon during jul to nov might have created an opportunity for the continuous growth of p raciborskii in addition high water temperature promoted the extracellular release of mib posing a greater risk to water treatment plants in low latitude reservoirs this study could also provide scientific basis regarding the prevention and or control of mib producing p raciborskii in source water reservoirs 5 conclusion in this study a mib episode in a low latitude drinking water reservoir was investigated filamentous cyanobacteria strain planktothricoides raciborskii was isolated and identified as the main mib producer in this reservoir based on the culturing experiments and in situ verification the physiological characteristics of p raciborskii was explored and the following conclusions can be drawn 1 p raciborskii could grow under a low nutrient condition tn 800 μg l 1 tp 10 μg l 1 but favored moderate light intensity 54 μmol photon m 2 s 1 and high temperature 30 c 2 the long period of high temperature might have inhibited the growth of the bloom forming limnothrix and aphanizomenon creating the opportunity for the continuous growth of p raciborskii 3 the mib synthesis and extracellular release could be enhanced by high light and temperature posing a greater risk to water plants in low latitude regions declaration of competing interest the authors declare

15829,an industrial ceramic nanofiltration membrane pore size 0 9 nm was tested in a canadian oil field for more than 12 500 h to treat wastewater directly from daily operations without any type of pre treatment this wastewater contained a high content of total suspended solids 13 to 510 mg kg and total organic carbon 31 to 134 mg kg the membrane unit was operated at different transmembrane pressure tmp set points 4 16 bar and recovery set points 40 80 the data show that ion and compound rejection depend strongly on a combination of both tmp and recovery with the largest rejection occurring at low recovery values and high tmp values two mechanisms were responsible for rejection sieving which mostly impacted compound rejection and electrostatic phenomena that impacted ion rejection it is shown that ion rejection depends linearly on charge density of the ion ion rejection was measured as high as 85 and compounds such as tss were rejected as high as 100 the specific flux varied between 1 10 l m2 h bar results from this field testing indicate the possibility of using these types of ceramic membranes for oil field wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical

in the oil and gas sector is treated and recirculated by different means both chemically and mechanically the water quality to be treated varies greatly by geography and type of reservoir but in general the water will contain cations ranging from sodium to calcium magnesium and barium anions including sulfates chlorides and bicarbonate and traces of oil sand and clay padaki et al 2015 oil and solids are typically characterized as total organic carbon toc morgan 2018 and total suspended solids tss respectively whereas the ions are combined as total dissolved solids tds basha et al 2008 typical water treatment technologies in the oil and gas industry include the use of chemical additives such as clarifiers demulsifiers and softeners and the use of microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf and reverse osmosis ro membranes adham et al 2018 awwa 1996 lately the use of nanofiltration nf membranes has been more prominent especially in desalination and sulphate removal units and multi valent ion removal adham et al 2018 nf membranes can be defined as those membranes with a pore diameter below 2 nm molecular weight cut offs mwco for neutral species in the range of 150 2000 da and in general constituting separation performances between ultra filtration uf and reverse osmosis ro biron et al 2018 nf membranes typically reject divalent cations more than monovalent cations but overall can reject a significant amount of the ions present in these waters in addition to the bigger chemical structures of oil sand and clay hemati et al 2010 deriszadeh ali and thomas 2010 mueller et al 2008 duraisamy et al 2013 ashaghi et al 2008 moreover they can do so with a much lower pressure rating than reverse osmosis and hence constitute a lower energy consumption solution to ion separation whenever the separation performance is acceptable nf membranes are sometimes referred to leaky ro because some monovalent ions pass through the membrane as opposed to ro membranes in oil and gas applications this leaky performance may be acceptable for most applications peng et al 2004 nf membranes have an active layer which is where most of the separation occurs typically these layers contain ionizable groups that charge the membrane surface allowing for an extra mechanism for separation biron et al 2018 the materials used to manufacture nf membranes can be polymeric in which the active surface may be comprised of carboxylic or sulfonic acid groups or ceramic in which the active surface is comprised of metal oxides such as titania and zirconia polymeric membranes have the advantage of being very inexpensive sturdy to cracking and easy to manufacture padaki et al 2015 while ceramic membranes are more resistant to abrasion chemical stress thermal aging and fouling lobo et al 2006 sadeghian et al 2010 furthermore ceramic membranes are easier to maintain have longer life spans and do not swell or compact during operation amin and abdallah 2016 tarabara et al 2010 nf ceramic membranes also have a narrower and better defined pore structure as compared to polymeric membranes padaki et al 2015 these characteristics make ceramic membranes better performers than polymeric membranes in systems that contain oil contaminants hemati et al 2010 ashaghi et al 2008 even with these potential advantages for ceramic membranes the low costs of polymeric membranes continue to make them popular for many academic research efforts although polymeric nf membranes have been introduced since the 1970s it was only after the late 1980s that they started to being used more frequently for oil and gas applications biron et al 2018 in particular polymeric nf membranes are not widely used water filtration is mostly dominated by uf and ro combinations but they have been used to treat wastewater from oil fields in various benchtop experiments where hardness calcium and magnesium and naphthenic acids have been removed by more than 95 peng et al 2004 and toc tds and divalent ions have been rejected by more than 98 farrukh 2018 the use of ceramic membranes has been introduced later than polymeric membranes mainly to separate non aqueous solvents lately however ceramic membranes were also used in some studies of oil and gas wastewaters as they become more economic over time padaki et al 2015 nf membranes with pore sizes between 1 8 2 5 nm were used with synthetic oil field water to demonstrate a very high rejection of oil content by up to 99 these series of experiments were executed with trans membrane pressure tmp ranging from 0 5 to 2 bar and crossflow velocity cfv from 0 6 to 1 3 m s the obtained specific fluxes ranged from 3 4 to 3300 l m2 h bar ebrahimi et al 2009 2010 a reduction of more than 95 of organic content in oil field wastewater was obtained in another series of experiments on laboratory scale using ceramic nf membrane with selective layers made of titania alumina or zirconia and pore sizes between 3 5 nm at 85 c and tmp of 5 bar yang et al 2022 ceramic nf membranes have also shown more selectivity for polar components than to non polar components in wastewater streams as an example those components in oil wastewater considered polar organic acids were shown to have lower rejection than non polar compounds e g aromatics paraffins in a series of experiments yang et al 2022 in addition it has been proven that increasing the size of flocs in wastewater by using coagulants leads to an increase in rejection of ions for both polymeric and ceramic nf membranes loganathan et al 2015 for example nacl rejection was increased from 69 to 82 in a series of experiments by the use of coagulants while overall fouling was decreased kim et al 2011 nf membranes provide strong performance on the removal of toc and tds from oil and gas operations wastewater moreover the advantages of ceramic over polymeric materials mostly its duration and thermal and abrasion resistance has led the authors to develop and study a novel commercial scale unit with titania membranes contrary to previous work this titania nanofiltration unit tnu was tested directly into an oil and gas application area not in a laboratory environment motta cabrera et al 2021 the unit was tested using wastewater from an oil field in canada containing a high content of ions solids and heavy oil viscosity 100 000 to 1 000 000 cp khan et al 1984 this wastewater continuously fed to the tnu presented variations in seasonal temperature water quality and other contaminants resulting from a 24 7 oil production the authors will explore and present in this work the effects of tmp recovery temperature and feed composition to the overall rejection of ions oil and solids content to demonstrate the viability of implementing ceramic nf technology in a field environment and select them most appropriate conditions to achieve maximum rejection 2 equipment and system description 2 1 commercial titania nanofiltration unit tnu the titania nanofiltration unit tnu is a fully automated membrane filtration unit containing four modules in series fig 1 each of the tnu membrane modules contains 45 membrane tubes fig 2 while each membrane tube has 151 channels or inner tubes where the wastewater enters the membrane unit puhlfürß et al 2000 a more in depth description of the unit can be found in previous work motta cabrera et al 2021 the tnu is connected to a wastewater source in a canadian oil mine field as shown in fig 3 the wastewater from this oil production field is partially stored in a pond and then fed to the tnu by a pump without any type of pre treatment this feed is recycled internally in the tnu through an internal recycle loop to increase crossflow velocity and control fouling feed water from the loop enters the inner tubes of the membrane with clean water being produced axially towards the outer layer of the membrane permeate the retentate or concentrate is produced at the end of the inner tube and enters the loop in addition there is a bleed retentate line the purple line in fig 3 each of the streams in the unit is equipped with a sampling point as seen in fig 3 flowmeters and pressure gauges all measured values such as temperature pressure and volumetric flow are recorded every 30 min the tnu can also run in two different operational modes stage cut constant mode where the tnu maintains a constant recovery by adjusting the tmp and tmp constant mode where the tmp is maintained by adjusting the recovery at the point where either parameter cannot be maintained constant the unit is stopped for an automatic chemical cleaning with caustic soda and citric acid table 1 shows the main design specifications and available ranges that can be introduced as settings in the tnu system 2 2 ceramic membranes the main properties of the membrane according to supplier rauschert inopor germany are shown in table 2 each membrane is comprised of three layers and applied on a macroporous alumina support this configuration is shown in the membrane sem image fig 2 the first layer is made of titania with a pore size of 5 nm followed by a zirconia intermediate layer with a pore size of 3 nm and ending in the main titania zirconia separation layer with a pore size of 0 9 nm voigt et al 2019 the total thickness of the latter two layers is 100 nm 3 experimental design 3 1 operational program in constant recovery mode the tnu will modify the tmp to obtain the set point as the membrane fouls over time and its specific flux decreases the system increases the tmp to reach the desired recovery when the tnu is not able to maintain the recovery then the unit is stopped for an automatic chemical cleaning after cleaning the specific flux l h m2 bar of the membrane is recovered fully as demonstrated in previous work motta cabrera et al 2021 conversely at tmp constant mode the tnu will utilize a variable recovery to reach the set tmp value as the membrane looses specific flux due to fouling the recovery is decreased until the tmp is reached or until a minimum value of specific flux is reached around 1 l m2 h bar at this point the system is chemically cleaned in previous work motta cabrera et al 2021 the tnu was operated at a constant recovery of 50 to eliminate this variable from the analysis and focus on the effect of tmp and specific flux on the ion rejection in the work shown in this paper the recovery has been varied between 40 and 80 to include its effect on rejection the constant tmp mode was also used at a wider pressure range 4 to 16 bar the specific fluxes obtained during the trial ranged from 1 to 10 l m2 h bar during the tests of the membrane unit wastewater temperature ph and composition of feed water changed over time and could not be controlled although they were measured hence the effect of these variables to rejection could be studied of these variables the one that presented most variability was the feed temperature as the trial was run with no temperature control for more than 12 500 h running through the seasons in the canadian subarctic wastewater temperature fluctuated between 4 and 50 c and ph varied between 7 7 and 8 4 the variability in temperature ph tss toc and tds are shown in table 3 electromagnetic flow sensors were used to measure the volumetric flow rates of feed permeate and retentate in the tnu whereas the inlet and outlet line temperatures were measured with thermocouples the tnu calculates the tmp as the average pressure difference between the permeate and retentate side using diaphragm pressure gauges the specific flux was calculated using the tmp the permeate volumetric rate and the membrane surface area per module 3 2 analytical sampling program the composition of the permeate feed and retentate were obtained through sampling during the trial about 200 samples of permeate feed and retentate were collected and analyzed from sampling points shown in fig 3 the samples were obtained using purging valves these samples were then analyzed by a third party lab to measure solids and oil content via dean stark distillation assay acosa 1984 as well as ion composition toc tss and tds table 4 lists all the 18 ions and 10 compounds detected inductive coupled plasma was used to detect cations ion chromatography was used for the anions and titration was used to evaluate bicarbonate content the tss was measured by suction filtration and drying at 105 c whereas the tds was measured by filtration with a whatman 934 ah filter and drying at 180 c finally the toc was measured through high temperature combustion rice et al 2017 3 3 data evaluation methodology the results obtained from this analytical sampling program were used to analyze the performance of the membranes the apparent rejection coefficient ro calculated as ro 1 ion permeate ion bulk where ion is the concentration of a particular ion in the permeate or the feed or bulk is often used to evaluate ion rejection in a membrane wang et al 2012 in this work however a mass balance approach is taken where the evaluation of the membrane performance is simply described as how much of an ion is rejected as a ratio of how much of that ion is in the feed this ion mass rejection rm is defined by eq 1 this definition provides a more straightforward representation of membrane ion rejection for industrial purposes for example a mass rejection of 60 implies that 60 of the mass of an ion is retained by the membrane and rejected in the retentate 1 rm mass rejection mass of ion in retentate mass of ion in feed m retentate x ion retentate m feed x ion feed 1 m permeate m feed x ion permeate ion feed here m is the mass flow of a stream and ion represents ion or compound concentration in the stream the mass flows in eq 1 were calculated using the volumetric flow values measured by the tnu and the density of the stream this density is calculated using the density of water at the measured temperature and the solids content assuming regular solution mixing rules reid et al 1977 it is important to mention that the observed trend of the mass rejection values versus tmp and recovery are the same as those of the apparent ion rejection coefficient ro in other words as will be discussed in section 4 1 if the mass rejection of an ion increases with tmp the rejection coefficient also increases with tmp as an example fig 4 a and b show respectively the mass rejection rm and apparent rejection coefficient ro of one of the ions studied in this work ca2 as a function of tmp at constant recoveries of 45 50 and 60 65 as can be seen both behaviors are linear and the slope is positive another aspect that can be seen in fig 4 is that the scatter in mass rejection is lower than that of the apparent rejection coefficient as mentioned in previous work motta cabrera et al 2021 the use of mass rejection helps to minimize the noise present in the data this noise could be caused by a variety of reasons including perturbations on feed mass flow temperature and composition which are common and unavoidable in a 24 7 oil operation it is important to note that the experimental values used in this work are in pseudo steady state fig 5 shows a schematic of a change in tmp for the tnu and when the samples are taken prior to changing a value of tmp in the tnu a sample is taken and deemed representative of the first steady state as explained earlier when the tmp is changed the tnu responds by changing the recovery until the set tmp is achieved the second sample is taken when the tmp is steady and deemed representative of the second steady state etc each state is not a true steady state because 1 the tnu is constantly being perturbed by external factors such as temperature flow rate and feed conditions since it is a live oil extraction operation and 2 the tnu is constantly adjusting the recovery in this case since the tmp is not only changing due to a change in the set point but also because of fouling as will be discussed in section 4 1 hence the values taken from the samples are considered at pseudo steady state although the experimental program executed with the tnu includes the measurement of transient values the transient analysis of the membrane is outside of the scope of this work finally the viscosity of the wastewater fed to the unit was considered to assess its effect on ion and compounds rejection the viscosity was calculated as a function of temperature based on the water viscosity utilizing the vogel fulcher tamman semi empirical equation and the einstein equation to adjust for the solid content in the water since its concentration is less than 10 reid et al 1977 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of tmp and recovery on membrane specific flux preliminary results from the tests with the tnu showed a correlation between ion rejection and transmembrane pressure tmp positive relation and membrane specific flux l m2 h bar negative relation at a constant recovery value of 50 the relationship between these variables indicated the formation of a cake layer or solute solute attachment to the membrane that was favoring ions rejection motta cabrera et al 2021 fig 6 a shows the specific flux as a function of tmp 4 16 bar for all data collected which includes a broad range of recoveries 35 80 as can be seen there is a correlation between these two variables where the higher the tmp the lower the specific flux this indicates as shown in previous work that the formation of a cake layer is likely occurring at all conditions interestingly the specific flux of the membrane does not have a notable correlation with recovery as seen in fig 6b although it may be expected that an increase in recovery may lead to lower specific flux it seems that changes in recovery are not associated with changes in the specific flux of the membrane and therefore with changes of the thickness of the charged cake layer at pseudo steady state however an increase in recovery most likely changes the rate at which the specific flux of the membrane is reduced this transient behavior of the membrane is out of the scope of this paper and will be covered in a future manuscript as part of these series of papers describing the performance of the tnu membranes 4 2 effect of recovery on ion and compound rejection to explore the effect of recovery on ion mass rejection data were collected when the tnu was operated at constant tmp mode as an example a divalent cation calcium ca2 and a divalent anion sulfate so 4 2 were chosen for this analysis fig 7 shows the ion mass rejection of calcium and sulfate for different tmp set points as a function of recovery as can be seen there is a linear correlation between ion mass rejection and recovery regardless of the nature of the ion moreover there is no significant variation between the results in the tmp range of 4 to 16 bar consequently a single linear correlation covers the data well across these tmps the behavior shown in fig 7 could be related to an increase in ions concentration at the surface of the membrane as the recovery is increased at a constant pressure singh 2006 as long as the crossflow velocity is maintained constant in these experiments the crossflow was maintained at 2 0 m s with an increment in recovery more ions are drawn towards the wall of the membrane and hence the ion concentration at the membrane wall increases this represents a gain in ion flux due to diffusion across the membrane and hence a reduction in rejection is expected i e more ions pass to the permeate proof of this phenomenon could be explored by modeling the membrane behavior which is beyond the scope of this paper the linear correlation shown in fig 7 for calcium and sulfate ions extend across all ions tested with the slopes listed in table 5 the values of the slope are remarkably consistent across monovalent and divalent ions with some exceptions for iron manganese aluminum nitrite nitrate and bromine monovalent ions of both cations and anions have slopes between 0 90 and 0 96 whereas the slope of divalent ions range between 0 73 and 0 78 this means that the mass rejection of monovalent ions is more susceptible to changes in recovery than divalent ions as will be discussed in section 4 4 it is expected that ions with a larger charge density such as divalent ions in this case will be rejected more than monovalent ions under the same circumstances hence the effect of changes in recovery to mass rejection may be less pronounced in higher charge density ions which is in accordance with the differences in slopes seen in table 5 this simple evaluation of the mass rejection of ions as a function of recovery helps to elucidate important differences between ions with different charge densities one aspect seen in fig 7 is that the behavior is unlikely to be linear where the recovery is close to 100 eq 1 based on eq 1 it is expected that the data must obey two points in the plot at recovery 0 the mass rejection is 100 and at a recovery 100 the mass rejection is 0 these are two evident physical states at each extreme of operation where there is no flow either in the permeate or the retentate i e a dead end filtration at one extreme when there is no flow to the permeate then the mass rejection is complete since the permeate would not have ion mass at the other extreme when the flow of the permeate equals that of the feed the reject would contain no ion mass and hence there would be no mass rejection most of the intercepts listed in table 5 representing the rejection at recovery 0 are very close to 100 with small variations likely related to perturbations in the data this is consistent with eq 1 however the extrapolation of these values towards a recovery 100 often goes beyond the 0 mass rejection to illustrate this point fig 7 also shows an extrapolation to these two extremes the extrapolation does not represent any model it is shown as a guide to the eye as can be seen the linear behavior must become non linear near 100 recovery to fit the definition of mass rejection in eq 1 in fact this behavior is typically seen in nf and ro types of membranes singh 2006 unfortunately these regions were not evaluated during the trial and remain speculative fig 8 shows the mass rejection as a function of the recovery for toc and tss as examples of compounds that are expected to be rejected mainly on its size i e sieving effect as can be seen the linear correlation in this case is weaker with a much larger scatter than in the case of the ions as shown in fig 7 the hypothesized behavior of an increase in solute concentration at the wall of the membrane as the recovery increases hence increasing ion diffusion is not as evident with the components there is some correlation with toc as some of the smaller organic components may indeed diffuse through the membrane for tss the sieving effect is more apparent as the mass rejection remains very high at all values of recovery 4 3 effect of tmp on ion and compound mass rejection to elucidate the relationship between recovery and ion mass rejection at all tmp values measured the complete set of sampled data obtained in the tnu testing tnu run at constant recovery and tmp constant mode were analyzed as discussed in section 4 1 previous work demonstrated a strong linear dependency of ion mass rejection on tmp at a constant recovery 50 that was linked to a reduction in specific flux and the formation of a cake layer motta cabrera et al 2021 based on the correlations found in fig 7 it would be expected that the linear dependency between ion mass rejection and tmp at other values of rejection would run parallel to the correlation at a rejection of 50 to develop this parallel line the change in the ion mass rejection δrm is calculated as the change in the recovery δy multiplied by the slope listed in table 5 the new ion mass rejection rm ynew is calculated as shown in eq 2 2 rm y new rm y 50 m rm y x y new y 50 for example at a recovery y 47 5 and a tmp of 4 bar the measured rejection of ca2 is 58 to calculate the rejection at a recovery y 57 5 the change in recovery δy 10 is multiplied by the slope listed in table 5 0 77 to obtain a change in rejection of δrm 8 hence the new rejection of ca2 is 50 at 4 bar and a recovery y 57 5 fig 9 shows ion mass rejection as a function of tmp for the same ions shown in fig 7 ca2 and so 4 2 at various ranges of recovery values in addition the figure shows trends developed using eq 2 and the mid point value of the experimental ranges of recovery for example the black dots represent experimental data for recovery values ranging from 55 1 to 60 and the model recovery my is calculated at the mid point 57 5 black line as can be seen even with the basic model shown in eq 2 the calculated values follow the experimental data trends the data shown in fig 9 confirms that a linear correlation between mass rejection and tmp is held at all recovery values within the experimental range of 40 80 it is likely that this behavior is due to a reduction in specific flux at all recovery set points at any given tmp meaning that a cake layer is formed in a similar manner regardless of the recovery or the tmp fig 10 shows mass rejection as a function of tmp at various recoveries for two types of compounds toc and tss included are the trends calculated using eq 2 as discussed in section 4 2 the correlation between toc and tss mass rejection and recovery is not as strong as with ions in general the predictions of the recovery trends for toc follow the same pattern as the experimental data but have significant scatter mass rejection for tss do not follow the experimental data trends reflecting the lack of correlation seen in fig 8b 4 4 effect of charge density on ion rejection the metal oxide titania zirconia at the membrane surface can help dissociate water via chemisorption into m oh2 or m o m stands for a metal oxide essentially acting as a base or an acid depending on the ph the point at which this transition occurs is called the isoelectric point of the membrane iep gun ko et al 1999 liang 2018 tamura et al 2001 whenever the membrane is exposed to water with a ph lower than the iep the membrane is charged positively by the formation of the m oh2 bond at the surface of the metal oxide while the m o bond will be formed at ph higher than the iep charging the membrane negatively as the ph of the wastewater fed to the tnu ranged between 7 7 and 8 4 and with the titania zirconia membrane surface having an isoelectric point iep between 6 5 and 7 0 it is expected that the membrane is negatively charged at all conditions presented here as such negatively charged ions are expected to be rejected due to repulsion forces from the charged membrane or the charged cake layer however if only electrostatic repulsion is considered the anions would be dominant in the retentate resulting in an imbalance of charge at both sides of the membrane hence as the anions are rejected then the cations must be rejected to counteract the potential difference across the membrane in order to maintain electroneutrality liang 2018 to have a better understanding of how the electrical charge of the ions impact their rejection fig 11 shows the ion mass rejection of selected cations and anions as a function of their charge density calculated as the ratio of the valence and the hydrated radii of the ion in previous work motta cabrera et al 2021 it was shown that at a constant tmp of 13 bar and recovery of 50 cations and anions were rejected linearly with their charge density with those with the highest charge density being rejected the most these 50 recovery data are shown in fig 11 together with more data at different recovery values and tmp values the linear relationship found in earlier work is maintained at different tmp and recovery values the ions with the largest charge density are rejected the most for both cations and anions this further is evidence of electrostatic phenomena impacting the rejection of these ions the changes in rejection seen in fig 11 would not be significantly influenced by the change in ion size since the hydrated diameter is smaller than the membrane pore diameter as shown in table s1 or in other words if the membrane was not charged the rejection of this ions would have been much smaller from the point of view of sieving effect only fig 11 also shows the mass rejection of ions at different selected tmp and recovery conditions as discussed earlier tmp and recovery play an important role this can be seen in the figure as the mass rejections change with a change in tmp or recovery however it may be inferred that there is little apparent effect of the tmp and recovery on the electrostatic phenomena since the changes in mass rejection remain similar at all conditions in other words the slope of the lines in fig 9 are very similar with the difference between the lowest and largest rejection being about 10 points at all conditions and for both types of ions 4 5 effect of temperature on ion mass rejection the effect of the seasonal temperature variations was evaluated through the viscosity of the wastewater feed to the tnu it may be argued that an increase in temperature and hence a reduction in viscosity would have increased the water flux and hence the rejection singh 2006 however as seen fig 12 there is negligible correlation between the viscosity and specific flux of the membrane treating the wastewater of this oil field other factors discussed before such as the variables tmp and recovery and electrostatic and sieving phenomena seem to have much more influence in the ion mass rejection than temperature 4 6 overall behaviour of ion mass rejection previous sections in this work discussed the effects of tmp and recovery and showed evidence of electrostatic phenomena for one cation and anion the intent of this section is to provide a holistic view of how the rejection behaves with these variables and how all the anions and cations present in the wastewater show very similar and systematic trends due to the large amount of data collected in this work heat maps are used to better visualize the entire data set a generic heat map example is shown in fig 13 in the heat maps the colors stand for in red an ion with a low mass rejection 20 or less and in green an ion with mass rejection of 80 or more there is a color gradient connecting the two colors the columns of the heat map represent narrow recovery ranges tested in the tnu starting from 45 up to 80 the rows show tmp values from 4 to 16 bar in the heat map example the transition from low rejection in red towards higher rejection in green follow a trend where the lowest rejection is seen at high recovery and low tmp and the highest rejection is shown at a low recovery and high tmp in other words the mass rejection increases from top right to lower left since the heat map represents the behavior of the rejection with both tmp and recovery the complete set of data is used including both operating modes of the tnu fig 14 shows the heat maps applied for all cations evaluated during the test monovalent divalent and trivalent each heat map is labelled with the cation symbol and its hydrated radius from left to right heat maps are given with decreasing hydrated radii for ions with identical charge the mass rejections in these heat maps were taken from linear correlations of the actual data obtained by the tnu for each recovery range some of the ions displayed in table 4 are not included in the heat map since the third party lab found only traces of these ions from 0 005 to 0 2 mg kg in the permeate stream as can be seen from the results in fig 14 divalent ions are rejected more than monovalent ions as evidenced by the darker green colors on the lower left corner for divalent ions and the darker red color at the top right corner for monovalent ions it could also bee seen that smaller cations are rejected better than larger ones the highest rejection for monovalent cations is 67 potassium and 78 for divalent cations barium fig 15 shows the heat maps for anions the trends seen for anions are very similar to those seen for cations the highest rejection for monovalent anions is 70 nitrate and 73 for divalent anions sulfate bromine shows an even larger rejection 78 however in previous work motta cabrera et al 2021 bromine showed erratic behaviour when compared with all the other ions a tendency that continued with the work presented in this manuscript it is likely that the detection of this ion has some analytical errors in fact some of these errors can be seen in the heat map as the color in some columns is not a continuous gradient from red to green all relevant data can be found in the supplementary information tables s2 s4 which includes main operation conditions during the tnu testing and rejections of all ions and compounds as listed in table 4 5 conclusions a commercial ceramic nanofiltration membrane made of titania and zirconia has been tested for more than 12 500 h to treat wastewater in a 24 7 oil field operation in canada the wastewater quality varied during the testing of the titania nanofiltration unit tnu due to normal operations the total suspended solids tss in the feed ranged between 13 and 510 mg kg and the total dissolved solids tds or ion content in the water varied between 695 and 1350 mg kg with a variance of 100 and 129 mg kg respectively total organic content toc which indicated mainly how much oil was in the water changed between 31 and 134 mg kg with a variance of 16 mg kg ph ranges between 7 7 and 8 4 and temperature varies between 4 2 and 49 5 c depending on the season the unit was tested in two modes recovery constant mode where the transmembrane pressure tmp was modified to achieve the recovery set point and tmp constant mode where the recovery was the variable changed to achieve a set tmp value values of recovery and tmp ranged between 40 and 80 and 4 and 16 bar respectively the specific flux range during the experiments varied between 1 10 l m2 h bar across all conditions tss were rejected between 86 and 100 and toc between 58 and 93 the rejection of tss and toc is most likely driven by sieving effect since the size of these compounds is expected to be larger than the average membrane pore size 0 9 nm in the case of organic matter coming form the oil some light compounds with a low carbon number may have ended up in the permeate reducing the overall toc rejection the sieving effect was apparent for these two types of compounds after evaluating the trends of rejection with recovery in the case of tss and toc the rejection remained high at all conditions tested contrary to ion rejection where sieving may be only partially responsible the behavior of ion mass rejection across all 18 ions tested in the wastewater follow similar trends except for a few outliers in general ion mass rejection increased linearly with an increase in tmp and decreased linearly with an increase in recovery this linear behavior was seen within the conditions tested although it is speculated that the behavior may be non linear outside of these boundaries moreover a strong relationship of specific flux of the membrane with tmp was seen the fact that ion mass rejection increased with an increase tmp and a decrease of specific flux led to the conclusion of the formation of a cake layer that is enhancing ion rejection on the other hand the specific flux did not have a strong correlation with recovery it is assumed that a change in recovery will affect the rate of cake layer formation but not its steady state value the data also shows that the membrane preferentially rejects ions with a larger charge density at all conditions for both cations and anions this trend seems not to be impacted significantly by tmp nor recovery for anions rejection is likely linked to repulsion with the charged membrane cake layer whereas cations are rejected by the membrane to allow for electroneutrality across the membrane separation unit declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15829,an industrial ceramic nanofiltration membrane pore size 0 9 nm was tested in a canadian oil field for more than 12 500 h to treat wastewater directly from daily operations without any type of pre treatment this wastewater contained a high content of total suspended solids 13 to 510 mg kg and total organic carbon 31 to 134 mg kg the membrane unit was operated at different transmembrane pressure tmp set points 4 16 bar and recovery set points 40 80 the data show that ion and compound rejection depend strongly on a combination of both tmp and recovery with the largest rejection occurring at low recovery values and high tmp values two mechanisms were responsible for rejection sieving which mostly impacted compound rejection and electrostatic phenomena that impacted ion rejection it is shown that ion rejection depends linearly on charge density of the ion ion rejection was measured as high as 85 and compounds such as tss were rejected as high as 100 the specific flux varied between 1 10 l m2 h bar results from this field testing indicate the possibility of using these types of ceramic membranes for oil field wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical

in the oil and gas sector is treated and recirculated by different means both chemically and mechanically the water quality to be treated varies greatly by geography and type of reservoir but in general the water will contain cations ranging from sodium to calcium magnesium and barium anions including sulfates chlorides and bicarbonate and traces of oil sand and clay padaki et al 2015 oil and solids are typically characterized as total organic carbon toc morgan 2018 and total suspended solids tss respectively whereas the ions are combined as total dissolved solids tds basha et al 2008 typical water treatment technologies in the oil and gas industry include the use of chemical additives such as clarifiers demulsifiers and softeners and the use of microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf and reverse osmosis ro membranes adham et al 2018 awwa 1996 lately the use of nanofiltration nf membranes has been more prominent especially in desalination and sulphate removal units and multi valent ion removal adham et al 2018 nf membranes can be defined as those membranes with a pore diameter below 2 nm molecular weight cut offs mwco for neutral species in the range of 150 2000 da and in general constituting separation performances between ultra filtration uf and reverse osmosis ro biron et al 2018 nf membranes typically reject divalent cations more than monovalent cations but overall can reject a significant amount of the ions present in these waters in addition to the bigger chemical structures of oil sand and clay hemati et al 2010 deriszadeh ali and thomas 2010 mueller et al 2008 duraisamy et al 2013 ashaghi et al 2008 moreover they can do so with a much lower pressure rating than reverse osmosis and hence constitute a lower energy consumption solution to ion separation whenever the separation performance is acceptable nf membranes are sometimes referred to leaky ro because some monovalent ions pass through the membrane as opposed to ro membranes in oil and gas applications this leaky performance may be acceptable for most applications peng et al 2004 nf membranes have an active layer which is where most of the separation occurs typically these layers contain ionizable groups that charge the membrane surface allowing for an extra mechanism for separation biron et al 2018 the materials used to manufacture nf membranes can be polymeric in which the active surface may be comprised of carboxylic or sulfonic acid groups or ceramic in which the active surface is comprised of metal oxides such as titania and zirconia polymeric membranes have the advantage of being very inexpensive sturdy to cracking and easy to manufacture padaki et al 2015 while ceramic membranes are more resistant to abrasion chemical stress thermal aging and fouling lobo et al 2006 sadeghian et al 2010 furthermore ceramic membranes are easier to maintain have longer life spans and do not swell or compact during operation amin and abdallah 2016 tarabara et al 2010 nf ceramic membranes also have a narrower and better defined pore structure as compared to polymeric membranes padaki et al 2015 these characteristics make ceramic membranes better performers than polymeric membranes in systems that contain oil contaminants hemati et al 2010 ashaghi et al 2008 even with these potential advantages for ceramic membranes the low costs of polymeric membranes continue to make them popular for many academic research efforts although polymeric nf membranes have been introduced since the 1970s it was only after the late 1980s that they started to being used more frequently for oil and gas applications biron et al 2018 in particular polymeric nf membranes are not widely used water filtration is mostly dominated by uf and ro combinations but they have been used to treat wastewater from oil fields in various benchtop experiments where hardness calcium and magnesium and naphthenic acids have been removed by more than 95 peng et al 2004 and toc tds and divalent ions have been rejected by more than 98 farrukh 2018 the use of ceramic membranes has been introduced later than polymeric membranes mainly to separate non aqueous solvents lately however ceramic membranes were also used in some studies of oil and gas wastewaters as they become more economic over time padaki et al 2015 nf membranes with pore sizes between 1 8 2 5 nm were used with synthetic oil field water to demonstrate a very high rejection of oil content by up to 99 these series of experiments were executed with trans membrane pressure tmp ranging from 0 5 to 2 bar and crossflow velocity cfv from 0 6 to 1 3 m s the obtained specific fluxes ranged from 3 4 to 3300 l m2 h bar ebrahimi et al 2009 2010 a reduction of more than 95 of organic content in oil field wastewater was obtained in another series of experiments on laboratory scale using ceramic nf membrane with selective layers made of titania alumina or zirconia and pore sizes between 3 5 nm at 85 c and tmp of 5 bar yang et al 2022 ceramic nf membranes have also shown more selectivity for polar components than to non polar components in wastewater streams as an example those components in oil wastewater considered polar organic acids were shown to have lower rejection than non polar compounds e g aromatics paraffins in a series of experiments yang et al 2022 in addition it has been proven that increasing the size of flocs in wastewater by using coagulants leads to an increase in rejection of ions for both polymeric and ceramic nf membranes loganathan et al 2015 for example nacl rejection was increased from 69 to 82 in a series of experiments by the use of coagulants while overall fouling was decreased kim et al 2011 nf membranes provide strong performance on the removal of toc and tds from oil and gas operations wastewater moreover the advantages of ceramic over polymeric materials mostly its duration and thermal and abrasion resistance has led the authors to develop and study a novel commercial scale unit with titania membranes contrary to previous work this titania nanofiltration unit tnu was tested directly into an oil and gas application area not in a laboratory environment motta cabrera et al 2021 the unit was tested using wastewater from an oil field in canada containing a high content of ions solids and heavy oil viscosity 100 000 to 1 000 000 cp khan et al 1984 this wastewater continuously fed to the tnu presented variations in seasonal temperature water quality and other contaminants resulting from a 24 7 oil production the authors will explore and present in this work the effects of tmp recovery temperature and feed composition to the overall rejection of ions oil and solids content to demonstrate the viability of implementing ceramic nf technology in a field environment and select them most appropriate conditions to achieve maximum rejection 2 equipment and system description 2 1 commercial titania nanofiltration unit tnu

membrane tube has 151 channels or inner tubes where the wastewater enters the membrane unit puhlfürß et al 2000 a more in depth description of the unit can be found in previous work motta cabrera et al 2021 the tnu is connected to a wastewater source in a canadian oil mine field as shown in fig 3 the wastewater from this oil production field is partially stored in a pond and then fed to the tnu by a pump without any type of pre treatment this feed is recycled internally in the tnu through an internal recycle loop to increase crossflow velocity and control fouling feed water from the loop enters the inner tubes of the membrane with clean water being produced axially towards the outer layer of the membrane permeate the retentate or concentrate is produced at the end of the inner tube and enters the loop in addition there is a bleed retentate line the purple line in fig 3 each of the streams in the unit is equipped with a sampling point as seen in fig 3 flowmeters and pressure gauges all measured values such as temperature pressure and volumetric flow are recorded every 30 min the tnu can also run in two different operational modes stage cut constant mode where the tnu maintains a constant recovery by adjusting the tmp and tmp constant mode where the tmp is maintained by adjusting the recovery at the point where either parameter cannot be maintained constant the unit is stopped for an automatic chemical cleaning with caustic soda and citric acid table 1 shows the main design specifications and available ranges that can be introduced as settings in the tnu system 2 2 ceramic membranes the main properties of the membrane according to supplier rauschert inopor germany are shown in table 2 each membrane is comprised of three layers and applied on a macroporous alumina support this configuration is shown in the membrane sem image fig 2 the first layer is made of titania with a pore size of 5 nm followed by a zirconia intermediate layer with a pore size of 3 nm and ending in the main titania zirconia separation layer with a pore size of 0 9 nm voigt et al 2019 the total thickness of the latter two layers is 100 nm 3 experimental design 3 1 operational program in constant recovery mode the tnu will modify the tmp to obtain the set point as the membrane fouls over time and its specific flux decreases the system increases the tmp to reach the desired recovery when the tnu is not able to maintain the recovery then the unit is stopped for an automatic chemical cleaning after cleaning the specific flux l h m2 bar of the membrane is recovered fully as demonstrated in previous work motta cabrera et al 2021 conversely at tmp constant mode the tnu will utilize a variable recovery to reach the set tmp value as the membrane looses specific flux due to fouling the recovery is decreased until the tmp is reached or until a minimum value of specific flux is reached around 1 l m2 h bar at this point the system is chemically cleaned in previous work motta cabrera et al 2021 the tnu was operated at a constant recovery of 50 to eliminate this variable from the analysis and focus on the effect of tmp and specific flux on the ion rejection in the work shown in this paper the recovery has been varied between 40 and 80 to include its effect on rejection the constant tmp mode was also used at a wider pressure range 4 to 16 bar the specific fluxes obtained during the trial ranged from 1 to 10 l m2 h bar during the tests of the membrane unit wastewater temperature ph and composition of feed water changed over time and could not be controlled although they were measured hence the effect of these variables to rejection could be studied of these variables the one that presented most variability was the feed temperature as the trial was run with no temperature control for more than 12 500 h running through the seasons in the canadian subarctic wastewater temperature fluctuated between 4 and 50 c and ph varied between 7 7 and 8 4 the variability in temperature ph tss toc and tds are shown in table 3 electromagnetic flow sensors were used to measure the volumetric flow rates of feed permeate and retentate in the tnu whereas the inlet and outlet line temperatures were measured with thermocouples the tnu calculates the tmp as the average pressure difference between the permeate and retentate side using diaphragm pressure gauges the specific flux was calculated using the tmp the permeate volumetric rate and the membrane surface area per module 3 2 analytical sampling program the composition of the permeate feed and retentate were obtained through sampling during the trial about 200 samples of permeate feed and retentate were collected and analyzed from sampling points shown in fig 3 the samples were obtained using purging valves these samples were then analyzed by a third party lab to measure solids and oil content via dean stark distillation assay acosa 1984 as well as ion composition toc tss and tds table 4 lists all the 18 ions and 10 compounds detected inductive coupled plasma was used to detect cations ion chromatography was used for the anions and titration was used to evaluate bicarbonate content the tss was measured by suction filtration and drying at 105 c whereas the tds was measured by filtration with a whatman 934 ah filter and drying at 180 c finally the toc was measured through high temperature combustion rice et al 2017 3 3 data evaluation methodology the results obtained from this analytical sampling program were used to analyze the performance of the membranes the apparent rejection coefficient ro calculated as ro 1 ion permeate ion bulk where ion is the concentration of a particular ion in the permeate or the feed or bulk is often used to evaluate ion rejection in a membrane wang et al 2012 in this work however a mass balance approach is taken where the evaluation of the membrane performance is simply described as how much of an ion is rejected as a ratio of how much of that ion is in the feed this ion mass rejection rm is defined by eq 1 this definition provides a more straightforward representation of membrane ion rejection for industrial purposes for example a mass rejection of 60 implies that 60 of the mass of an ion is retained by the membrane and rejected in the retentate 1 rm mass rejection mass of ion in retentate mass of ion in feed m retentate x ion retentate m feed x ion feed 1 m permeate m feed x ion permeate ion feed here m is the mass flow of a stream and ion represents ion or compound concentration in the stream the mass flows in eq 1 were calculated using the volumetric flow values measured by the tnu and the density of the stream this density is calculated using the density of water at the measured temperature and the solids content assuming regular solution mixing rules reid et al 1977 it is important to mention that the observed trend of the mass rejection values versus tmp and recovery are the same as those of the apparent ion rejection coefficient ro in other words as will be discussed in section 4 1 if the mass rejection of an ion increases with tmp the rejection coefficient also increases with tmp as an example fig 4 a and b show respectively the mass rejection rm and apparent rejection coefficient ro of one of the ions studied in this work ca2 as a function of tmp at constant recoveries of 45 50 and 60 65 as can be seen both behaviors are linear and the slope is positive another aspect that can be seen in fig 4 is that the scatter in mass rejection is lower than that of the apparent rejection coefficient as mentioned in previous work motta cabrera et al 2021 the use of mass rejection helps to minimize the noise present in the data this noise could be caused by a variety of reasons including perturbations on feed mass flow temperature and composition which are common and unavoidable in a 24 7 oil operation it is important to note that the experimental values used in this work are in pseudo steady state fig 5 shows a schematic of a change in tmp for the tnu and when the samples are taken prior to changing a value of tmp in the tnu a sample is taken and deemed representative of the first steady state as explained earlier when the tmp is changed the tnu responds by changing the recovery until the set tmp is achieved the second sample is taken when the tmp is steady and deemed representative of the second steady state etc each state is not a true steady state because 1 the tnu is constantly being perturbed by external factors such as temperature flow rate and feed conditions since it is a live oil extraction operation and 2 the tnu is constantly adjusting the recovery in this case since the tmp is not only changing due to a change in the set point but also because of fouling as will be discussed in section 4 1 hence the values taken from the samples are considered at pseudo steady state although the experimental program executed with the tnu includes the measurement of transient values the transient analysis of the membrane is outside of the scope of this work finally the viscosity of the wastewater fed to the unit was considered to assess its effect on ion and compounds rejection the viscosity was calculated as a function of temperature based on the water viscosity utilizing the vogel fulcher tamman semi empirical equation and the einstein equation to adjust for the solid content in the water since its concentration is less than 10 reid et al 1977 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of tmp and recovery on membrane specific flux preliminary results from the tests with the tnu showed a correlation between ion rejection and transmembrane pressure tmp positive relation and membrane specific flux l m2 h bar negative relation at a constant recovery value of 50 the relationship between these variables indicated the formation of a cake layer or solute solute attachment to the membrane that was favoring ions rejection motta cabrera et al 2021 fig 6 a shows the specific flux as a function of tmp 4 16 bar for all data collected which includes a broad range of recoveries 35 80 as can be seen there is a correlation between these two variables where the higher the tmp the lower the specific flux this indicates as shown in previous work that the formation of a cake layer is likely occurring at all conditions interestingly the specific flux of the membrane does not have a notable correlation with recovery as seen in fig 6b although it may be expected that an increase in recovery may lead to lower specific flux it seems that changes in recovery are not associated with changes in the specific flux of the membrane and therefore with changes of the thickness of the charged cake layer at pseudo steady state however an increase in recovery most likely changes the rate at which the specific flux of the membrane is reduced this transient behavior of the membrane is out of the scope of this paper and will be covered in a future manuscript as part of these series of papers describing the performance of the tnu membranes 4 2 effect of recovery on ion and compound rejection to explore the effect of recovery on ion mass rejection data were collected when the tnu was operated at constant tmp mode as an example a divalent cation calcium ca2 and a divalent anion sulfate so 4 2 were chosen for this analysis fig 7 shows the ion mass rejection of calcium and sulfate for different tmp set points as a function of recovery as can be seen there is a linear correlation between ion mass rejection and recovery regardless of the nature of the ion moreover there is no significant variation between the results in the tmp range of 4 to 16 bar consequently a single linear correlation covers the data well across these tmps the behavior shown in fig 7 could be related to an increase in ions concentration at the surface of the membrane as the recovery is increased at a constant pressure singh 2006 as long as the crossflow velocity is maintained constant in these experiments the crossflow was maintained at 2 0 m s with an increment in recovery more ions are drawn towards the wall of the membrane and hence the ion concentration at the membrane wall increases this represents a gain in ion flux due to diffusion across the membrane and hence a reduction in rejection is expected i e more ions pass to the permeate proof of this phenomenon could be explored by modeling the membrane behavior which is beyond the scope of this paper the linear correlation shown in fig 7 for calcium and sulfate ions extend across all ions tested with the slopes listed in table 5 the values of the slope are remarkably consistent across monovalent and divalent ions with some exceptions for iron manganese aluminum nitrite nitrate and bromine monovalent ions of both cations and anions have slopes between 0 90 and 0 96 whereas the slope of divalent ions range between 0 73 and 0 78 this means that the mass rejection of monovalent ions is more susceptible to changes in recovery than divalent ions as will be discussed in section 4 4 it is expected that ions with a larger charge density such as divalent ions in this case will be rejected more than monovalent ions under the same circumstances hence the effect of changes in recovery to mass rejection may be less pronounced in higher charge density ions which is in accordance with the differences in slopes seen in table 5 this simple evaluation of the mass rejection of ions as a function of recovery helps to elucidate important differences between ions with different charge densities one aspect seen in fig 7 is that the behavior is unlikely to be linear where the recovery is close to 100 eq 1 based on eq 1 it is expected that the data must obey two points in the plot at recovery 0 the mass rejection is 100 and at a recovery 100 the mass rejection is 0 these are two evident physical states at each extreme of operation where there is no flow either in the permeate or the retentate i e a dead end filtration at one extreme when there is no flow to the permeate then the mass rejection is complete since the permeate would not have ion mass at the other extreme when the flow of the permeate equals that of the feed the reject would contain no ion mass and hence there would be no mass rejection most of the intercepts listed in table 5 representing the rejection at recovery 0 are very close to 100 with small variations likely related to perturbations in the data this is consistent with eq 1 however the extrapolation of these values towards a recovery 100 often goes beyond the 0 mass rejection to illustrate this point fig 7 also shows an extrapolation to these two extremes the extrapolation does not represent any model it is shown as a guide to the eye as can be seen the linear behavior must become non linear near 100 recovery to fit the definition of mass rejection in eq 1 in fact this behavior is typically seen in nf and ro types of membranes singh 2006 unfortunately these regions were not evaluated during the trial and remain speculative fig 8 shows the mass rejection as a function of the recovery for toc and tss as examples of compounds that are expected to be rejected mainly on its size i e sieving effect as can be seen the linear correlation in this case is weaker with a much larger scatter than in the case of the ions as shown in fig 7 the hypothesized behavior of an increase in solute concentration at the wall of the membrane as the recovery increases hence increasing ion diffusion is not as evident with the components there is some correlation with toc as some of the smaller organic components may indeed diffuse through the membrane for tss the sieving effect is more apparent as the mass rejection remains very high at all values of recovery 4 3 effect of tmp on ion and compound mass rejection to elucidate the relationship between recovery and ion mass rejection at all tmp values measured the complete set of sampled data obtained in the tnu testing tnu run at constant recovery and tmp constant mode were analyzed as discussed in section 4 1 previous work demonstrated a strong linear dependency of ion mass rejection on tmp at a constant recovery 50 that was linked to a reduction in specific flux and the formation of a cake layer motta cabrera et al 2021 based on the correlations found in fig 7 it would be expected that the linear dependency between ion mass rejection and tmp at other values of rejection would run parallel to the correlation at a rejection of 50 to develop this parallel line the change in the ion mass rejection δrm is calculated as the change in the recovery δy multiplied by the slope listed in table 5 the new ion mass rejection rm ynew is calculated as shown in eq 2 2 rm y new rm y 50 m rm y x y new y 50 for example at a recovery y 47 5 and a tmp of 4 bar the measured rejection of ca2 is 58 to calculate the rejection at a recovery y 57 5 the change in recovery δy 10 is multiplied by the slope listed in table 5 0 77 to obtain a change in rejection of δrm 8 hence the new rejection of ca2 is 50 at 4 bar and a recovery y 57 5 fig 9 shows ion mass rejection as a function of tmp for the same ions shown in fig 7 ca2 and so 4 2 at various ranges of recovery values in addition the figure shows trends developed using eq 2 and the mid point value of the experimental ranges of recovery for example the black dots represent experimental data for recovery values ranging from 55 1 to 60 and the model recovery my is calculated at the mid point 57 5 black line as can be seen even with the basic model shown in eq 2 the calculated values follow the experimental data trends the data shown in fig 9 confirms that a linear correlation between mass rejection and tmp is held at all recovery values within the experimental range of 40 80 it is likely that this behavior is due to a reduction in specific flux at all recovery set points at any given tmp meaning that a cake layer is formed in a similar manner regardless of the recovery or the tmp fig 10 shows mass rejection as a function of tmp at various recoveries for two types of compounds toc and tss included are the trends calculated using eq 2 as discussed in section 4 2 the correlation between toc and tss mass rejection and recovery is not as strong as with ions in general the predictions of the recovery trends for toc follow the same pattern as the experimental data but have significant scatter mass rejection for tss do not follow the experimental data trends reflecting the lack of correlation seen in fig 8b 4 4 effect of charge density on ion rejection the metal oxide titania zirconia at the membrane surface can help dissociate water via chemisorption into m oh2 or m o m stands for a metal oxide essentially acting as a base or an acid depending on the ph the point at which this transition occurs is called the isoelectric point of the membrane iep gun ko et al 1999 liang 2018 tamura et al 2001 whenever the membrane is exposed to water with a ph lower than the iep the membrane is charged positively by the formation of the m oh2 bond at the surface of the metal oxide while the m o bond will be formed at ph higher than the iep charging the membrane negatively as the ph of the wastewater fed to the tnu ranged between 7 7 and 8 4 and with the titania zirconia membrane surface having an isoelectric point iep between 6 5 and 7 0 it is expected that the membrane is negatively charged at all conditions presented here as such negatively charged ions are expected to be rejected due to repulsion forces from the charged membrane or the charged cake layer however if only electrostatic repulsion is considered the anions would be dominant in the retentate resulting in an imbalance of charge at both sides of the membrane hence as the anions are rejected then the cations must be rejected to counteract the potential difference across the membrane in order to maintain electroneutrality liang 2018 to have a better understanding of how the electrical charge of the ions impact their rejection fig 11 shows the ion mass rejection of selected cations and anions as a function of their charge density calculated as the ratio of the valence and the hydrated radii of the ion in previous work motta cabrera et al 2021 it was shown that at a constant tmp of 13 bar and recovery of 50 cations and anions were rejected linearly with their charge density with those with the highest charge density being rejected the most these 50 recovery data are shown in fig 11 together with more data at different recovery values and tmp values the linear relationship found in earlier work is maintained at different tmp and recovery values the ions with the largest charge density are rejected the most for both cations and anions this further is evidence of electrostatic phenomena impacting the rejection of these ions the changes in rejection seen in fig 11 would not be significantly influenced by the change in ion size since the hydrated diameter is smaller than the membrane pore diameter as shown in table s1 or in other words if the membrane was not charged the rejection of this ions would have been much smaller from the point of view of sieving effect only fig 11 also shows the mass rejection of ions at different selected tmp and recovery conditions as discussed earlier tmp and recovery play an important role this can be seen in the figure as the mass rejections change with a change in tmp or recovery however it may be inferred that there is little apparent effect of the tmp and recovery on the electrostatic phenomena since the changes in mass rejection remain similar at all conditions in other words the slope of the lines in fig 9 are very similar with the difference between the lowest and largest rejection being about 10 points at all conditions and for both types of ions 4 5 effect of temperature on ion mass rejection the effect of the seasonal temperature variations was evaluated through the viscosity of the wastewater feed to the tnu it may be argued that an increase in temperature and hence a reduction in viscosity would have increased the water flux and hence the rejection singh 2006 however as seen fig 12 there is negligible correlation between the viscosity and specific flux of the membrane treating the wastewater of this oil field other factors discussed before such as the variables tmp and recovery and electrostatic and sieving phenomena seem to have much more influence in the ion mass rejection than temperature 4 6 overall behaviour of ion mass rejection previous sections in this work discussed the effects of tmp and recovery and showed evidence of electrostatic phenomena for one cation and anion the intent of this section is to provide a holistic view of how the rejection behaves with these variables and how all the anions and cations present in the wastewater show very similar and systematic trends due to the large amount of data collected in this work heat maps are used to better visualize the entire data set a generic heat map example is shown in fig 13 in the heat maps the colors stand for in red an ion with a low mass rejection 20 or less and in green an ion with mass rejection of 80 or more there is a color gradient connecting the two colors the columns of the heat map represent narrow recovery ranges tested in the tnu starting from 45 up to 80 the rows show tmp values from 4 to 16 bar in the heat map example the transition from low rejection in red towards higher rejection in green follow a trend where the lowest rejection is seen at high recovery and low tmp and the highest rejection is shown at a low recovery and high tmp in other words the mass rejection increases from top right to lower left since the heat map represents the behavior of the rejection with both tmp and recovery the complete set of data is used including both operating modes of the tnu fig 14 shows the heat maps applied for all cations evaluated during the test monovalent divalent and trivalent each heat map is labelled with the cation symbol and its hydrated radius from left to right heat maps are given with decreasing hydrated radii for ions with identical charge the mass rejections in these heat maps were taken from linear correlations of the actual data obtained by the tnu for each recovery range some of the ions displayed in table 4 are not included in the heat map since the third party lab found only traces of these ions from 0 005 to 0 2 mg kg in the permeate stream as can be seen from the results in fig 14 divalent ions are rejected more than monovalent ions as evidenced by the darker green colors on the lower left corner for divalent ions and the darker red color at the top right corner for monovalent ions it could also bee seen that smaller cations are rejected better than larger ones the highest rejection for monovalent cations is 67 potassium and 78 for divalent cations barium fig 15 shows the heat maps for anions the trends seen for anions are very similar to those seen for cations the highest rejection for monovalent anions is 70 nitrate and 73 for divalent anions sulfate bromine shows an even larger rejection 78 however in previous work motta cabrera et al 2021 bromine showed erratic behaviour when compared with all the other ions a tendency that continued with the work presented in this manuscript it is likely that the detection of this ion has some analytical errors in fact some of these errors can be seen in the heat map as the color in some columns is not a continuous gradient from red to green all relevant data can be found in the supplementary information tables s2 s4 which includes main operation conditions during the tnu testing and rejections of all ions and compounds as listed in table 4 5 conclusions a commercial ceramic nanofiltration membrane made of titania and zirconia has been tested for more than 12 500 h to treat wastewater in a 24 7 oil field operation in canada the wastewater quality varied during the testing of the titania nanofiltration unit tnu due to normal operations the total suspended solids tss in the feed ranged between 13 and 510 mg kg and the total dissolved solids tds or ion content in the water varied between 695 and 1350 mg kg with a variance of 100 and 129 mg kg respectively total organic content toc which indicated mainly how much oil was in the water changed between 31 and 134 mg kg with a variance of 16 mg kg ph ranges between 7 7 and 8 4 and temperature varies between 4 2 and 49 5 c depending on the season the unit was tested in two modes recovery constant mode where the transmembrane pressure tmp was modified to achieve the recovery set point and tmp constant mode where the recovery was the variable changed to achieve a set tmp value values of recovery and tmp ranged between 40 and 80 and 4 and 16 bar respectively the specific flux range during the experiments varied between 1 10 l m2 h bar across all conditions tss were rejected between 86 and 100 and toc between 58 and 93 the rejection of tss and toc is most likely driven by sieving effect since the size of these compounds is expected to be larger than the average membrane pore size 0 9 nm in the case of organic matter coming form the oil some light compounds with a low carbon number may have ended up in the permeate reducing the overall toc rejection the sieving effect was apparent for these two types of compounds after evaluating the trends of rejection with recovery in the case of tss and toc the rejection remained high at all conditions tested contrary to ion rejection where sieving may be only partially responsible the behavior of ion mass rejection across all 18 ions tested in the wastewater follow similar trends except for a few outliers in general ion mass rejection increased linearly with an increase in tmp and decreased linearly with an increase in recovery this linear behavior was seen within the conditions tested although it is speculated that the behavior may be non linear outside of these boundaries moreover a strong relationship of specific flux of the membrane with tmp was seen the fact that ion mass rejection increased with an increase tmp and a decrease of specific flux led to the conclusion of the formation of a cake layer that is enhancing ion rejection on the other hand the specific flux did not have a strong correlation with recovery it is assumed that a change in recovery will affect the rate of cake layer formation but not its steady state value the data also shows that the membrane preferentially rejects ions with a larger charge density at all conditions for both cations and anions this trend seems not to be impacted significantly by tmp nor recovery for anions rejection is likely linked to repulsion with the charged membrane cake layer whereas cations are rejected by the membrane to allow for electroneutrality across the membrane separation unit declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
