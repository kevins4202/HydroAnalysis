9765,inappropriate irrigation and nitrogen application had caused low water and nitrogen use efficiency and severe no3 n leaching in spring wheat field in the wuliangshuhai lake watershed wlslw of northwest china thus aimed at determining the rational irrigation and nitrogen fertilization for spring wheat in this area field experiments were carried out in the 2019 and 2020 seasons to investigate the effects of irrigation and nitrogen application on soil water and nitrogen status grain yield and water and nitrogen use efficiency three irrigation levels i e 180 315 and 450 mm i3 i2 and i1 and three nitrogen fertilization rates i e 170 250 and 340 kg n ha 1 n3 n2 and n1 were respectively considered in the experiments results indicated that increasing irrigation depth increased root zone soil available water and increasing nitrogen application could significantly enhance the available nitrogen content in root zone soils and the soil water utilization amount by wheat under the control treatment i1n1 about 25 32 of the applied nitrogen was leached out of the root zone soils throughout the year compared to the control treatment the i2n2 treatment could reduce no3 n leaching by 32 and increased the water use efficiency wue and partial factor productivity of nitrogen fertilizer pfpn by 33 and 44 respectively in addition the highest yield and net profit of 8078 kg ha 1 and 1 82 104 chinese yuan ha 1 was achieved by the i2n2 treatment respectively and it was 6 higher than that of the control treatment therefore considering the grain yield wue pfpn economic benefits and environmental impacts the strategy of 315 mm irrigation and 250 kg n ha 1 nitrogen application is recommended for spring wheat in the arid agricultural watershed of northwest china and areas with similar conditions keywords irrigation and fertilization management water saving groundwater pollution water productivity partial factor productivity of nitrogen fertilizer 1 introduction at the global scale the food demand is expected to double by the middle of the 21st century due to rapid population growth tilman et al 2011 wheat is one of the most globally consumed food crops and it is also the main food crop in china playing a significant role in ensuring food security and socio economic stability jiang et al 2012 wang et al 2019 in china huge amounts of water and fertilizer resources have been used for wheat production to ensure food supply but it has brought a series of adverse problems such as water shortages low water and fertilizer use efficiency and it has also brought environmental pollution caused by water and fertilizer loss liang et al 2014 li et al 2019 the wuliangsuhai lake watershed wlslw is a main high quality wheat production region in northwest china with a growing area of about 4 7 104 ha in recent years due to the climate characteristics of scarce precipitation and intense evaporation irrigation and fertilization become the necessary technical measures for crop production liu et al 2016 the irrigation depth of spring wheat in the wlslw exceeds 400 mm during the growth season zhang et al 2013 in addition in november each year local farmers also implement an autumn irrigation with about 250 mm water which is mainly for the purpose of salt leaching these factors cause about 150 mm of water loss annually through deep percolation xu et al 2010 meanwhile a relatively high nitrogen application rate with about 350 kg ha 1 per season has been used to ensure high yield such use leads to high soil no3 n accumulation and no3 n leaching to groundwater and drainage ditches and then the leached nitrogen flows to the wuliangsu lake through the drainage water both excessive irrigation and nitrogen application result in low water and nitrogen use efficiency increase the risk of groundwater and surface water pollution and threaten the sustainability of agro eco environmental systems in the wlslw according to the report of liu et al 2007 about 2 7 106 kg of nitrogen is discharged into the wuliangshuhai lake annually causing the eutrophication and swamping of the wuliangsuhai lake li et al 2020 therefore it becomes necessary to search for appropriate irrigation and nitrogen application strategies with the consideration of maintaining relatively high crop yield and improving water use efficiency wue and nitrogen use efficiency nue while minimizing nitrogen leaching in the wlslw in general an appropriate irrigation strategy can reduce irrigation applied water and it can improve wue while maintaining crop yield to some extent igbadun et al 2008 jiang et al 2012 for example ning et al 2010 found that in the huanghuaihai region of china decreasing the irrigation depth to some extent had no significant effect on crop yield but obviously increased the wue of winter wheat zhao et al 2003 reported that in the north china plain the wue of winter wheat increased with the decrease of irrigation depth to a range of 105 450 mm and the highest yield and high wue were achieved with an irrigation depth of 370 mm chen et al 2018 also found that in the arid region of northwest china for drip irrigated wheat its yield and wue first increased and then decreased when decreasing the irrigation quota from 320 mm to 180 mm and the highest wheat yield and wue were obtained with the irrigation quota of 290 mm in addition previous findings also confirmed that appropriate deficit irrigation could increase wue while it did not significantly impact grain yield by reducing the total irrigation amount jiang et al 2012 wen et al 2019 found that deficit irrigation with 60 of soil water holding capacity in sandy loam soil was beneficial to increasing spring wheat wue and maintaining its yield jin et al 1999 reported that excessive irrigation decreased crops wue and effective deficit irrigation resulted in higher yield and wue fertilization is another critical factor for crop production reasonable nitrogen application is conducive to high crop yield and efficient nitrogen utilization mon et al 2016 wu et al 2008 found that the nitrogen application of 150 kg ha 1 increased the nue of wheat by 44 and maintained high yield in the loamy soil field with high fertility compared with the nitrogen application of 250 kg ha 1 ye and li 2009 found that in the desert soil farmland a 225 kg ha 1 nitrogen application obtained higher yield and nue of wheat riley et al 2001 also reported that adequate nitrogen supply to meet the requirement of wheat nitrogen consumption was essential for achieving highest grain yield but excessive nitrogen application over crop requirement reduced grain yield and nue additionally excessive nitrogen supply in high soil moisture conditions enhances the risk of nitrogen leaching loss and reasonably reducing the nitrogen application rate is an effective way to solve this problem du et al 2011 liu et al 2003 found that in the north china plain reducing the nitrogen application rate from 360 kg ha 1 to 120 kg ha 1 minimized no3 n leaching loss while maintaining high crop yield and nue in winter wheat summer maize cropping system shi et al 2012 reported that in the middle and lower yangtze river basin of china reducing the nitrogen from 350 kg ha 1 to 210 kg ha 1 could effectively reduce nitrogen leaching loss and improved grain yield and nue previous studies have found that reasonable irrigation and nitrogen application can effectively increase crop yield and water and nitrogen use efficiency and reduce nitrogen leaching liu et al 2003 jiang et al 2012 however due to the differences in climate and soil conditions the optimal irrigation and nitrogen application rates may vary in different regions in addition most previous studies mainly focus on no3 n leaching loss caused by irrigation during the crop growth period little attention has been paid to no3 n leaching loss caused by autumn irrigation so the annual total no3 n leaching and its potential risk to environmental pollution may be underestimated therefore in order to alleviate the low water and nitrogen use efficiency and serious non point source pollution caused by excessive irrigation and fertilization it is important to accurately evaluate the total no3 n leaching and search an appropriate irrigation and nitrogen application strategy for crops e g wheat in the wlslw we hypothesized that the traditional irrigation and nitrogen application rates for spring wheat fields were the same in the wlslw the main research objectives are 1 to investigate the impact of irrigation and nitrogen application on soil available water and nitrogen status grain yield and water and nitrogen use efficiency of spring wheat farmland 2 to quantitatively evaluate the annual no3 n leaching loss of surface irrigated spring wheat farmland 3 to propose an appropriate irrigation and nitrogen application strategy for spring wheat in the arid agricultural watershed of northwest china 2 materials and method 2 1 experimental site description field experiments were conducted at the fenzidi experimental station in the wlslw in 2019 and 2020 the experimental station is located in the northern part of wlslw latitude 41 09 n longitude 107 39 e with an average elevation of 1031 m the climatic condition in the study area is a semi arid temperate continental climate characterized by sufficient sunshine a large temperature difference between day and night and the annual average temperature of 6 8 the annual precipitation is around 160 240 mm with significant seasonality the annual reference evapotranspiration et0 is about 800 1200 mm and the et0 during the growth season of spring wheat is about 400 550 mm the reference evapotranspiration was estimated by the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 soils were classified as a silt loam soil at the depth of 0 70 cm and loamy soil at the depth of 70 100 cm according to the us textural classification shirazi and boersma 1984 the average organic matter content of 0 100 cm soil is 14 33 g kg 1 detailed physical and chemical properties of soils in the study site are presented in table 1 li et al 2020 a miniature weather station hobo u30 usa was installed in the test field and the meteorological data precipitation and air temperature were recorded every 30 min the groundwater table was monitored with an automatic water level logger buried in an observation well within the experimental field the meteorological data precipitation and air temperature and groundwater table during the spring wheat growth periods in 2019 and 2020 are shown in fig 1 the precipitation during the growth period in 2019 and 2020 was 14 mm and 42 2 mm respectively and the groundwater depth was between 1 and 2 7 m 2 2 experimental design and field management the experimental design was completely randomized in considering the two factors of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization in the 2019 and 2020 growth seasons the experiments included three irrigation levels i e high water i1 450 mm medium water i2 315 mm and low water i3 180 mm and two nitrogen fertilization rates i e high nitrogen n1 340 kg ha 1 and low nitrogen n3 170 kg ha 1 there were six treatments i e i1n1 i2n1 i3n1 i1n3 i2n3 and i3n3 in addition a treatment with a medium nitrogen application rate i e n2 250 kg ha 1 and medium water level was also considered in 2020 among these treatments i1n1 is the control treatment corresponding to the local farmer practices each treatment had three replications each test plot had an area of 175 m2 with a length of 25 m and a width of 7 m a buffer zone with a width of 10 m was set up surrounding the experimental plots to avoid the influence of irrigation and fertilization from the nearby areas the field ridges with a height of 0 4 m and a width of 0 6 m were built and surrounded each plot to minimize the horizontal interference of adjacent plots water was applied to field with surface irrigation and the amount of irrigation in each plot was measured by the water meter lxs 25e china the 3 irrigations were carried out on may 10th may 21th and june 18th in 2019 and on may 10th may 21th and june 18th in 2020 respectively the average irrigation flow was 18 m3 h 1 and the water depth of each irrigation event for i1 i2 and i3 treatments was 150 105 and 60 mm respectively the test field was leveled before sowing to ensure the irrigation uniformity for each plot the fertilizer was evenly sprayed on soil surface 1 h before irrigation and the method type and time of fertilization were consistent with the local spring wheat production the basal fertilizer was applied in the field before sowing with the same amount of phosphate p and potassium k and nitrogen n in all treatment plots the p k and n application amounts for each plot were 95 95 and 50 kg ha 1 respectively 60 of the remaining nitrogen fertilization was applied at the tillering stage and the other 40 was used at the jointing stage the p k and n fertilizers were diammonium phosphate p 50 potassium oxide k 50 and urea n 46 table 2 shows the specific water and fertilizer treatments according to the local agricultural practices autumn irrigation with a depth of about 250 mm was implemented in november each year the purpose of autumn irrigation was to control soil salinity at a low level the average ec of the 0 100 cm soil layer was about 240 μs cm 1 after salt leaching so that the crop growth in the next season was not affected by salinity in addition autumn irrigation also produced a large amount of nitrogen leaching thus the difference of soil water and nitrogen content among the treatments was not significant at the beginning of the growth season the tested wheat cultivar was the yongliang no 4 which was widely planted in the wlslw the wheat was sowed on march 15th and harvested on july 20th in two experimental seasons the division of spring wheat growth stages in 2019 and 2020 is shown in table 3 the planting row spacing was 15 cm and the planting density was about 6 03 106 plants per hectare cultivation planting density and pest and disease management were the same as the local farmer practices 2 3 sample collection and measurement before sowing soil samples were taken from 0 to 100 cm soil depth according to the soil profile layering for soil physical and chemical properties analysis see table 1 then during wheat growing season soil samples from each plot were collected in a 10 day interval for soil water content nh4 n and no3 n determination soil sampling was performed at 10 cm intervals down to 20 cm and 20 cm intervals down to 100 cm soil depth using an auger soil water content was measured by the gravimetric method soil organic matter was measured using the potassium dichromate volumetric external heating method soil solution was extracted from the mixture of soil and 2 mol l 1 kcl solution at a ratio of 1 5 the solutions were then measured within 48 h for determining nh4 n and no3 n content using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv 3100 china sakamoto et al 2009 a similar method as that applied by li et al 2020 was also used for soil no3 n leaching measurement a steel bucket called leakage bucket consisting of a cylinder with a height of 100 cm and a diameter of 40 cm and a cone container with a height of 40 cm was buried in the middle of each plot the 100 cm cylinder of bucket was filled with soil at the same bulk density as that in the field and the conical part was emptied to collect the percolated soil solution the percolated solution was pumped 48 h after each irrigation and rainfall event until the leakage bucket was completely emptied and the volume and the concentration of inorganic nitrogen of the percolated solution were measured accordingly the soil solution collected in the seepage bucket was only used to quantitatively describe the amount of inorganic nitrogen leaching caused by the downward water flow in with irrigation and rainfall therefore the capillary compensation effect of groundwater was not considered at harvest the wheat plants from a 1 m2 area in each plot were cut off to measure the aboveground dry biomass these plants were first dried at 105 c for 1 h to inactivate the enzyme then they were dried at the temperature of 75 c to a constant weight this weight was recorded as the aboveground dry biomass per unit area for the corresponding treatment plot ten dried plant samples from each plot were selected and ground to 0 5 mm with an ultra micro crusher xl 30c china 50 0 mg plant samples were weighted and the plant samples were tightly wrapped in tin foil cones and then they were placed into an automatic injection tray of element analyzer vario macro cn german the analysis mode was set to cn the nitrogen content n ratio in plants was determined using the dry combustion method with element analyzer in addition with the same sampling method of mon et al 2016 peng et al 2019 and zhou 2020 the wheat plants in another 1 m2 area of each plot undisturbed by conventional samplings were also harvested for the measurement of grain yield and its components i e the ears per unit area kernel per ear and 1000 kernel weight the grains with a water content of 14 were considered as the standard yield of wheat 2 4 calculation and statistical analysis soil water storage in each growth stage can be

difference among treatments was determined by the least significant difference lsd at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil water storage and available nitrogen accumulation table 4 shows soil water storage at different growth stages for different treatments in 2019 and 2020 compared with i3 irrigation treatment except for the seeding stage i2 and i1 irrigation treatments increased the soil water storage by 6 15 in the tillering stage 8 20 in the jointing stage 0 1 19 in the heading stage 13 22 in the filling stage and 10 20 in the mature stage respectively there was no significant difference in soil water storage between i2 and i1 irrigation treatments however the nitrogen application rate had no significant impact on soil water storage at each growth stage the depletion of soil water storage in root zone 0 100 cm during the whole growth season for different treatments is presented in fig 2 it can be found that soil water depletion showed an increasing trend with the decrease of irrigation depth and the increase of nitrogen application table 5 shows soil available nitrogen at different growth stages for different treatments in 2019 and 2020 the results indicated that the effects of irrigation on soil available nitrogen were different for different stages from the seeding stage to the jointing stage there was no significant difference in root zone soil available nitrogen among the irrigation treatments however from the heading stage to the mature stage soil available nitrogen showed an increasing trend with the increase of irrigation depth the impacts of nitrogen application on soil available nitrogen were similar in different growth stages except for the seeding stage compared with n3 nitrogen application treatment n1 nitrogen application treatment obviously increased soil available nitrogen by 2 47 in tillering stage 19 72 in the jointing stage 17 140 in the heading stage 30 258 in the filling stage and 1 43 in the mature stage respectively in the 2019 and 2020 seasons whereas there was no obvious difference in soil available nitrogen between n1 and n2 nitrogen application treatments 3 2 no3 n leaching the cumulative no3 n leaching in 2019 and 2020 for different treatments is shown in fig 3 the value of cumulative no3 n leaching was in the range of 30 44 kg ha 1 in 2019 and 31 46 kg ha 1 in 2020 no3 n leaching during the growth season showed a decreasing trend with the decrease of irrigation depth and nitrogen application in addition 250 mm autumn irrigation resulted in a large amount of no3 n leaching for example with autumn irrigation no3 n leaching loss was in the range of 36 40 kg ha 1 in 2019 and 43 65 kg ha 1 in 2020 see fig 3c and d for the control treatment i e i1n1 the total no3 n leaching loss i e full anniversary no3 n leaching caused by growing season irrigations and autumn irrigation after harvest were 84 kg ha 1 in 2019 and 110 kg ha 1 in 2020 this indicated that about 25 32 of the applied nitrogen was leached out of the root zone compared with the control one the i2n2 and i3n3 irrigation and nitrogen application treatments reduced the full anniversary no3 n leaching by 32 and 39 respectively these results showed that reasonably reducing the irrigation depth and nitrogen application rate can effectively decrease no3 n leaching in addition the annual no3 n leaching in 2020 was 12 32 higher than that in 2019 the difference of no3 n leaching between the two experimental years might be attributed to the climatic variation 3 3 plant biomass and nitrogen uptake the aboveground dry biomass at harvest in 2019 and 2020 for different treatments is shown in fig 4 the aboveground dry biomass showed a decreasing trend with the decrease of irrigation depth and nitrogen application the control treatment obtained the highest dry biomass with values of 18 000 kg ha 1 in 2019 and 21 000 kg ha 1 in 2020 there was no difference in the aboveground dry biomass between the i2n2 irrigation and nitrogen application treatment and the control treatment compared with the i3n3 irrigation and nitrogen application treatment the i2n2 irrigation and nitrogen application treatment increased the aboveground dry biomass by 22 the impact of irrigation and nitrogen application on wheat nitrogen uptake was consistent with that of irrigation on the aboveground dry biomass fig 4c and d the control treatment obtained the highest nitrogen uptake of 325 kg ha 1 in 2019 and 323 kg ha 1 in 2020 moreover the i2n2 irrigation and nitrogen application treatment also obtained a high nitrogen uptake of 322 kg ha 1 these results indicated that the effects of the i2n2 irrigation and nitrogen application treatment on dry biomass production and wheat nitrogen uptake were almost the same as those of the control treatment 3 4 grain yield and yield components the anova and percentage of variance for the ears per unit area kernel per ear 1000 kernel weight and grain yield are shown in table 6 the results indicated that the anovas explained a range of total variability extending from 49 44 1000 kernel weight to 83 91 kernel per ear with an average of 70 79 these results generally showed that wheat grain yield and yield components were affected by irrigation fertilization and climate in addition irrigation explained the greatest amount of variability 36 42 for grain yield followed by the year 22 21 and nitrogen application 12 37 which indicated that grain yield was mainly influenced by irrigation followed by climatic variation and nitrogen application the above results indicated that yield production in this area was more sensitive to water than nitrogen wheat grain yield and yield components for different irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer treatments are shown in table 7 the value of grain yield was in the range of 5382 3 7125 1 kg ha 1 in 2019 and 6386 8 8078 3 kg ha 1 in 2020 compared with i3 irrigation treatment i1 irrigation treatment significantly increased grain yield by about 17 there was no significant difference in grain yield between i1 and i2 irrigation treatments the effect of irrigation on yield components ears per unit area kernel per ear and 1000 kernel weight was consistent with that of irrigation on grain yield n1 nitrogen application treatment had a higher grain yield than n3 nitrogen application treatment for i2 irrigation depth in 2020 wheat grain yield first increased and then decreased as nitrogen application increased and n2 nitrogen application treatment obtained the highest grain yield of 8078 3 kg ha 1 the effect of nitrogen application on kernel per ear and 1000 kernel weight was consistent with that of nitrogen application on grain yield these results indicated that the i3n3 irrigation and nitrogen application treatment was deficient in water and nitrogen for wheat production in addition the grain yield observed between i1 and i2 irrigation treatments had no significant difference compared with n2 nitrogen application treatment n1 nitrogen application treatment reduced grain yield these results suggested that the irrigation depth of i1 and nitrogen application of n1were excessive for wheat production in the study area furthermore the grain yield in 2020 was 7 19 higher than that in 2019 and compared with 2019 the differences in grain yield among different nitrogen treatments in 2020 were relatively small the difference of grain yield between the two experimental years might be attributed to the climatic variation 3 5 water and nitrogen use efficiency the wue of wheat showed an increasing trend with the decrease of irrigation depth table 7 compared with i1 irrigation treatment i2 and i3 irrigation treatments increased wue by 14 21 and 36 46 respectively compared with n1 and n3 nitrogen application treatment n2 nitrogen application treatment increased wue by 13 and 25 respectively whereas there was no significant difference of wue between n1 and n3 nitrogen application treatments this result indicated that appropriate irrigation and fertilization can effectively improve wue for example the i2n2 irrigation and nitrogen application treatment obtained a high wue of 18 56 kg ha 1 mm 1 which was about 33 higher than the wue for the control one the pfpn of wheat increased with the increase in irrigation depth table 7 compared with i3 irrigation treatment i1 and i2 irrigation treatments significantly increased pfpn there was no significant difference in pfpn between i1 and i2 irrigation treatments this result indicated that over irrigation could not significantly improve pfpn in addition reducing nitrogen application significantly increased pfpn of wheat the n2 and n3 nitrogen application treatments both obtained high pfpn values which were significantly higher than the pfpn for the n1 nitrogen application treatment however the n3 nitrogen application treatment was deficient in nitrogen for wheat production 3 6 correlations between soil water nitrogen and yield the mic and linear regression analyses were performed between the yield and soil water storage and soil available nitrogen at the tillering jointing heading and filling stages the results are listed in table 8 the mic values between the soil water storage at the tillering stage and ears per m2 and grain yield were 0 66 and 0 65 respectively this result indicated that the soil water storage at the tillering stage was closely related to the ears per unit area and grain yield the mic value showed the relationship between two factors without implying the type of association further analysis showed that there was a significant positive linear relationship between the soil water storage at the tillering stage and ears per m2 and grain yield see fig 5a and g the mic values between the soil water storage at the jointing and heading stages and the ears per m2 kernel per ear and grain yield and between the soil water storage at the filling stage and the 1000 kernel weight and grain yield were both larger than 0 5 it was also found that there was a significant positive linear relationship between the soil water storage at the jointing and heading stages and the ears per m2 kernel per ear and grain yield see fig 5b e h and i and there was a significant positive linear relationship between the soil water storage at the filling stage and the 1000 kernel weight and grain yield see fig 5f and j in addition there was a close correlation between the soil available nitrogen at the jointing stage and the kernel per ear and grain yield further analysis found a significant positive linear relationship between the soil available nitrogen at the jointing stage and the kernel per ear and grain yield see fig 5k and l however the soil available nitrogen at other growth stages had little impact on yield components and grain yield the above results indicated that sufficient water supply from the tillering stage to the filling stage can increase wheat grain yield by increasing the number and the weight of grains per unit area the higher soil available nitrogen at the jointing stage can increase the grain yield by increasing the kernel per ear 4 discussion 4 1 impact of irrigation on soil water storage increasing irrigation depth to some extent can increase soil water storage in the root zone but continuously increasing the irrigation depth is invaluable for soil water storage the reason for this result is that over irrigation may cause soil water content to exceed the field capacity thereby leads to deep percolation without significantly increase the soil water storage bethune et al 2008 li et al 2020 this result is in agreement with the findings of many previous studies wan et al 2018 wu et al 2019 this result demonstrates that there is a relatively large space for reducing the irrigation depth for spring wheat farmland in the wlslw therefore compared with the local practices i e i1 irrigation depth the appropriate irrigation practices with an irrigation depth of i2 can save 6 4 107 m3 irrigation water annually based on the spring wheat planting area of 4 7 104 ha 4 2 impact of irrigation and fertilization on soil available nitrogen accumulation and no3 n leaching increasing the irrigation depth usually increases nitrogen leaching thereby reducing soil available nitrogen accumulation in the root zone in this study increasing irrigation depth significantly decreased soil available nitrogen from the heading stage to the mature stage see table 5 this finding is primarily because no3 n was leached out of the wheat root zone by the three irrigations at the tillering jointing and heading stages and was also taken up by the wheat no3 n leaching and wheat nitrogen uptake was significantly increased with the increase of irrigation depth see figs 3a b and 4c d thereby decreased the soil available nitrogen du et al 2011 this result agrees with earlier studies of wang et al 2010 and lu et al 2019 who found that increasing irrigation depth increased inorganic nitrogen leaching and decreased soil nitrogen accumulation however there is no significant difference in soil available nitrogen among the different irrigation depth treatments at the tillering and jointing stages the reason for this result may be that no3 n was not leached out the 0 100 cm soil layer in a short period right after irrigations in addition the no3 n leaching in 2020 was higher than that in 2019 the reason for this result is that in 2020 the precipitation from wheat planting to the end of autumn irrigation was 68 mm higher than that in 2019 the higher precipitation resulted in higher deep percolation causing larger no3 n leaching many previous studies showed that increasing nitrogen fertilizer application can increase soil available nitrogen in the root zone and no3 n leaching shi et al 2012 he et al 2016 in this study soil available nitrogen significantly increased with the increase of nitrogen application from the tillering stage to the mature stage after topdressing see table 5 meanwhile no3 n leaching also showed an increasing trend with the increase of nitrogen application see fig 3a and b the result agrees with earlier studies of he et al 2016 and chen et al 2020 who found that compared with the low nitrogen application treatments high nitrogen application treatments provided more sources for soil available nitrogen supplementation lu et al 2019 also found that higher available nitrogen accumulation in soils increased the risk of nitrate leaching to groundwater however nitrogen application had no significant impacts on soil available nitrogen at the seedling stage and this might be attributed to that the basal fertilizer application was the same among the treatments no3 n leaching from root zone soil is a potential risk of surface and ground water pollution in the wlslw so optimizing the irrigation and fertilization strategy is critical to mitigate no3 n leaching for the local framer practices the annual no3 n leaching loss was estimated at about 5 2 106 kg from the wheat fields on the basis of its planting area this leaching amount accounts for about 25 32 of total applied nitrogen due to the local groundwater table being shallow the nitrogen is directly leached out of the root zone and accumulates in groundwater resulting in groundwater pollution part of the no3 n in groundwater gradually gets into the drainage ditches through groundwater flow and then flows through the drainage ditches to the downstream of the wlslw li et al 2020 and finally causes surface water pollution in the wuliangsuhai lake this study confirmed that reasonably reducing the irrigation depth and nitrogen application rate can effectively decrease no3 n leaching compared with the local farmer practices the appropriate irrigation and fertilization practices i e i2n2 can reduce no3 n leaching by about 32 and the total annual no3 n leaching loss from wheat fields of about 1 7 106 kg and can save 30 of total applied water and 27 of total applied nitrogen fertilizers respectively 4 3 impact of irrigation and fertilization on biomass yield and its components irrigation is a main agricultural management measure in arid areas of northern china which can improve soil available water first subsequently promotes wheat growth and ultimately increases biomass and grain yield wang et al 2010 ma and song 2018 the biomass increased with the increase of irrigation depth because increasing irrigation depth increased the root zone soil water storage see table 4 this result agrees with the findings of several previous studies zheng et al 2009 djaman et al 2013 in addition higher soil moisture from the tillering stage to the heading stage improved the ears per m2 and kernel per ear see fig 5a c the reason for this result is that tillering jointing and heading stages are the critical periods in determining the rate of ear and kernel formation adequate water supplies can lead to more available water and nutrients absorbed by wheat plants thereby promoting wheat reproductive development and ultimately increasing the ears and kernel per unit area wang and yu 2008 furthermore higher soil moisture at the filling stage increased the 1000 kernel weight see fig 5f this result agrees with the finding of yan et al 2019 who found that sufficient soil available water at the filling stage significantly increased wheat grain weight since the ears per unit area kernel per ear and 1000 kernel weight are decisive factors for making up wheat yield darroch and baker 1990 lizana et al 2010 therefore its grain yield also increased with the increase of soil water storage from the tillering stage to the filling stage see fig 5g j increasing irrigation depth improved the root zone soil water storage thus the grain yield increased with the increase of irrigation depth but there was no significant difference in biomass and grain yield between i1 and i2 irrigation treatments because over irrigation cannot significantly increase the soil water storage moreover the precipitation during the wheat growth season in 2020 was 28 2 mm higher than that in 2019 which inevitably led to the higher water supply during the wheat growth season in 2020 than that in 2019 this may be the reason that the grain yield in 2020 was higher than that in 2019 nitrogen application is another critical agricultural management measure affecting crops growth and production which can improve soil available nitrogen thereby influencing crop biomass accumulation and yield forde and lorenzo 2001 guan et al 2014 compared with n3 nitrogen application treatment n1 nitrogen application treatment increased the biomass see fig 4a and b the reason may be that increasing nitrogen application increased the root zone soil available nitrogen and thereby more available nitrogen was absorbed by wheat plants and translated into biomass liu et al 2003 guan et al 2014 in addition n1 nitrogen application treatment had a higher grain yield than n3 nitrogen application treatment because increasing nitrogen application increased the kernel per ear by increasing the soil available nitrogen see fig 5k and l this result is in agreement with the findings of many previous studies song et al 2016 2019 however excessive soil nitrogen content in the late growth stage was not conducive to wheat plant reproductive development riley et al 2001 jiang et al 2016 therefore the 1000 kernel weight and grain yield first increased with the increase of nitrogen application from n3 to n2 and then decreased with the increase of nitrogen application from n2 and n1 whereas there was little difference in biomass between n1 and n2 nitrogen application treatments the result agrees with earlier studies of yang et al 2001 and liang et al 2017 who found that excessive nitrogen application inhibited grain filling and caused lodging thereby resulting in biomass and grain loss moreover compared with 2019 the differences in wheat yield among different nitrogen treatments in 2020 were relatively small the main reason for this result may be that the precipitation during the wheat growth season in 2020 was higher than that in 2019 and relatively adequate water supply may alleviate the inhibitory effect of reduced nitrogen fertilization on wheat grain yield min et al 2016 yin et al 2016 4 4 impact of irrigation and fertilization on water and nitrogen use efficiency reasonable water and nitrogen management strategies can reduce water percolation and improve soil water use in the root zone ultimately increasing the wue li et al 2002 sun et al 2018a in our study over irrigation significantly reduced wheat wue while decreasing the irrigation depth increased wue the reason for this result is that on the one hand decreasing the irrigation depth may reduce deep percolation and on the other hand decreasing the irrigation depth can increase soil water depletion to supplement insufficient irrigation water this then results in a slight grain yield loss but a relatively large reduction of actual evapotranspiration and thus ultimately increases wue this result is in agreement with the findings of many previous studies yang et al 2009 xue et al 2014 additionally compared with low nitrogen application treatment high nitrogen application treatment increased wue because increasing nitrogen application can promote crop root growth and enhance the root water absorption and ultimately improve wue zhao et al 2003 that is also why increasing nitrogen application increased soil water depletion see fig 2 the above results revealed why wue increased with the increase of soil water storage depletion see fig 6a this means that appropriately reducing irrigation and increasing nitrogen fertilization can increase soil water utilization by wheat and thus improve wue this result agrees with the earlier study of zhang et al 2019 who found that increasing soil water storage consumption could improve wue reasonable irrigation and fertilization can promote the uptake of fertilizer nitrogen and soil nitrogen by wheat thereby increasing the nitrogen use efficiency kaiser et al 2010 our study showed that low irrigation depth significantly reduced wheat pfpn while increasing irrigation depth improved pfpn the reason for this result was that low irrigation depth e g i3 irrigation depth might result in water stress and inhibit plant growth and nitrogen uptake brockley 1981 increasing the irrigation depth alleviated the water stress first subsequently rapidly increased the wheat nitrogen uptake and ultimately increased pfpn see fig 6b dashed circle a similar result was obtained by mon et al 2016 in contrast under sufficient water conditions e g i1 and i2 irrigation depth nitrogen application had little impact on wheat nitrogen uptake mon et al 2016 shi et al 2012 therefore there was little difference in wheat nitrogen uptake among the nitrogen application treatments see the solid circles in fig 6b this result indicated that under the sufficient water conditions appropriately reducing the nitrogen application can decrease the nitrogen loss without affecting crop nitrogen uptake therefore the pfpn increased with the decrease of nitrogen application this result agrees with many previous studies shi et al 2012 wang et al 2016 the above results indicate that under water deficient conditions increasing irrigation depth can increase pfpn by improving the plants nitrogen uptake whereas under water sufficient conditions appropriately reducing nitrogen fertilizer application is an effective way to increase pfpn 4 5 irrigation and fertilization strategies for wheat appropriate water and nitrogen management strategies should consider grain yield water and nitrogen use efficiency economic benefits and environmental pollution risks caused by nitrate leaching in the wlslw excessive irrigation and nitrogen application had caused low water and nitrogen use efficiency low grain yield low net profit and high no3 n leaching loss however our study found that appropriately reducing the irrigation depth and the fertilization rate can effectively mitigate these problems for example reducing the irrigation depth from i1 450 mm to i2 315 mm and nitrogen application from n1 340 kg ha 1 to n2 250 kg ha 1 reduced the no3 n leaching by 32 increased grain yield wue pfpn and net profit by 6 33 44 and 6 respectively furthermore under similar nitrogen application conditions compared with the 150 210 mm irrigation depth recommended by zhang et al 2013 and li et al 2015 in this area the i2 irrigation treatment in this study increased yield and wue by about 7 20 and 4 14 respectively and under similar irrigation conditions compared with the 120 180 kg ha 1 nitrogen application rate recommended by dong et al 2011 and jia et al 2020 in this area the n2 nitrogen application treatment in this study reduced nue slightly and increased the yield and wue by 14 50 and 13 15 respectively therefore comprehensively considering yield wue nue economic benefits and environment impacts border irrigation with a depth of 315 mm and nitrogen fertilization with a rate of 250 kg ha 1 is regarded as an appropriate irrigation and fertilization strategy for spring wheat production in the arid agricultural watershed of northwest china although the effect of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization on crops grain yield and water and nitrogen use efficiency had been widely reported previous studies have obtained different results about the recommended irrigation depth and fertilization rate for wheat production this may be attributed to the issues that on the one hand different regions have different climate and soil conditions and on the other hand the best economic benefit and or the highest grain yield are considered as the sole objective of crop production whereas the multiple objectives with a reasonable economic benefit and or grain yield while with the lowest negative environmental and ecological impacts are pursued by different levels of government agencies for example in the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system in the weishan irrigation district at the lower yellow river basin an irrigation depth of 300 mm and a nitrogen application of 611 kg ha 1 were implemented by farmers to obtain the highest crops yield and net income but the government agencies recommend irrigation depth of 240 mm and nitrogen application of 458 kg ha 1 to control nitrogen leaching for reducing the risk of agricultural non point source pollution while maintaining high yield and net income tang et al 2015 in the north china plain farmers generally use excessive water and fertilizers with an irrigation depth of 285 375 mm and nitrogen application of 250 kg ha 1 to obtain the highest grain yield but comprehensively considering yield economic benefits and water and nitrogen use efficiency the irrigation depth of 240 260 mm and the nitrogen application of 210 kg ha 1 are recommended for winter wheat chen et al 2007 due to the limitations of field experiments this study can only obtain a relatively appropriate irrigation depth and fertilization strategy therefore further study is required to obtain an optimal irrigation and fertilization strategy using both the field trial tests and numerical simulations with considering both the economic and environmental benefits 5 conclusion increasing irrigation depth increased root zone soil available water but over irrigation was not useful for soil water storage and caused significant no3 n leaching whereas increasing nitrogen application significantly enhanced available nitrogen content in root zone soils in general the local farmer practices i1n1 for spring wheat resulted in higher no3 n leaching reducing irrigation depth to i2 and nitrogen application rate to n2 could effectively reduce no3 n leaching loss as well as maintaining grain yield and improved water and nitrogen use efficiency and net profit by taking this changed irrigation and fertilization practice for spring wheat in the wlslw about 6 4 107 m3 irrigation water can be saved and 1 7 106 tons of nitrogen will not be imposed on the water environment it can be concluded that the strategy with 315 mm irrigation and 250 kg ha 1 nitrogen application is recommendable for spring wheat in the arid agricultural watershed of northwest china and those areas with the reference evapotranspiration in a range of 400 550 mm during the growth season and the average organic matter content of root zone soil a value of about 14 g kg 1 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

9765,inappropriate irrigation and nitrogen application had caused low water and nitrogen use efficiency and severe no3 n leaching in spring wheat field in the wuliangshuhai lake watershed wlslw of northwest china thus aimed at determining the rational irrigation and nitrogen fertilization for spring wheat in this area field experiments were carried out in the 2019 and 2020 seasons to investigate the effects of irrigation and nitrogen application on soil water and nitrogen status grain yield and water and nitrogen use efficiency three irrigation levels i e 180 315 and 450 mm i3 i2 and i1 and three nitrogen fertilization rates i e 170 250 and 340 kg n ha 1 n3 n2 and n1 were respectively considered in the experiments results indicated that increasing irrigation depth increased root zone soil available water and increasing nitrogen application could significantly enhance the available nitrogen content in root zone soils and the soil water utilization amount by wheat under the control treatment i1n1 about 25 32 of the applied nitrogen was leached out of the root zone soils throughout the year compared to the control treatment the i2n2 treatment could reduce no3 n leaching by 32 and increased the water use efficiency wue and partial factor productivity of nitrogen fertilizer pfpn by 33 and 44 respectively in addition the highest yield and net profit of 8078 kg ha 1 and 1 82 104 chinese yuan ha 1 was achieved by the i2n2 treatment respectively and it was 6 higher than that of the control treatment therefore considering the grain yield wue pfpn economic benefits and environmental impacts the strategy of 315 mm irrigation and 250 kg n ha 1 nitrogen application is recommended for spring wheat in the arid agricultural watershed of northwest china and areas with similar conditions keywords irrigation and fertilization management water saving groundwater pollution water productivity partial factor productivity of nitrogen fertilizer 1 introduction at the global scale the food demand is expected to double by the middle of the 21st century due to rapid population growth tilman et al 2011 wheat is one of the most globally consumed food crops and it is also the main food crop in china playing a significant role in ensuring food security and socio economic stability jiang et al 2012 wang et al 2019 in china huge amounts of water and fertilizer resources have been used for wheat production to ensure food supply but it has brought a series of adverse problems such as water shortages low water and fertilizer use efficiency and it has also brought environmental pollution caused by water and fertilizer loss liang et al 2014 li et al 2019 the wuliangsuhai lake watershed wlslw is a main high quality wheat production region in northwest china with a growing area of about 4 7 104 ha in recent years due to the climate characteristics of scarce precipitation and intense evaporation irrigation and fertilization become the necessary technical measures for crop production liu et al 2016 the irrigation depth of spring wheat in the wlslw exceeds 400 mm during the growth season zhang et al 2013 in addition in november each year local farmers also implement an autumn irrigation with about 250 mm water which is mainly for the purpose of salt leaching these factors cause about 150 mm of water loss annually through deep percolation xu et al 2010 meanwhile a relatively high nitrogen application rate with about 350 kg ha 1 per season has been used to ensure high yield such use leads to high soil no3 n accumulation and no3 n leaching to groundwater and drainage ditches and then the leached nitrogen flows to the wuliangsu lake through the drainage water both excessive irrigation and nitrogen application result in low water and nitrogen use efficiency increase the risk of groundwater and surface water pollution and threaten the sustainability of agro eco environmental systems in the wlslw according to the report of liu et al 2007 about 2 7 106 kg of nitrogen is discharged into the wuliangshuhai lake annually causing the eutrophication and swamping of the wuliangsuhai lake li et al 2020 therefore it becomes necessary to search for appropriate irrigation and nitrogen application strategies with the consideration of maintaining relatively high crop yield and improving water use efficiency wue and nitrogen use efficiency nue while minimizing nitrogen leaching in the wlslw in general an appropriate irrigation strategy can reduce irrigation applied water and it can improve wue while maintaining crop yield to some extent igbadun et al 2008 jiang et al 2012 for example ning et al 2010 found that in the huanghuaihai region of china decreasing the irrigation depth to some extent had no significant effect on crop yield but obviously increased the wue of winter wheat zhao et al 2003 reported that in the north china plain the wue of winter wheat increased with the decrease of irrigation depth to a range of 105 450 mm and the highest yield and high wue were achieved with an irrigation depth of 370 mm chen et al 2018 also found that in the arid region of northwest china for drip irrigated wheat its yield and wue first increased and then decreased when decreasing the irrigation quota from 320 mm to 180 mm and the highest wheat yield and wue were obtained with the irrigation quota of 290 mm in addition previous findings also confirmed that appropriate deficit irrigation could increase wue while it did not significantly impact grain yield by reducing the total irrigation amount jiang et al 2012 wen et al 2019 found that deficit irrigation with 60 of soil water holding capacity in sandy loam soil was beneficial to increasing spring wheat wue and maintaining its yield jin et al 1999 reported that excessive irrigation decreased crops wue and effective deficit irrigation resulted in higher yield and wue fertilization is another critical factor for crop production reasonable nitrogen application is conducive to high crop yield and efficient nitrogen utilization mon et al 2016 wu et al 2008 found that the nitrogen application of 150 kg ha 1 increased the nue of wheat by 44 and maintained high yield in the loamy soil field with high fertility compared with the nitrogen application of 250 kg ha 1 ye and li 2009 found that in the desert soil farmland a 225 kg ha 1 nitrogen application obtained higher yield and nue of wheat riley et al 2001 also reported that adequate nitrogen supply to meet the requirement of wheat nitrogen consumption was essential for achieving highest grain yield but excessive nitrogen application over crop requirement reduced grain yield and nue additionally excessive nitrogen supply in high soil moisture conditions enhances the risk of nitrogen leaching loss and reasonably reducing the nitrogen application rate is an effective way to solve this problem du et al 2011 liu et al 2003 found that in the north china plain reducing the nitrogen application rate from 360 kg ha 1 to 120 kg ha 1 minimized no3 n leaching loss while maintaining high crop yield and nue in winter wheat summer maize cropping system shi et al 2012 reported that in the middle and lower yangtze river basin of china reducing the nitrogen from 350 kg ha 1 to 210 kg ha 1 could effectively reduce nitrogen leaching loss and improved grain yield and nue previous studies have found that reasonable irrigation and nitrogen application can effectively increase crop yield and water and nitrogen use efficiency and reduce nitrogen leaching liu et al 2003 jiang et al 2012 however due to the differences in climate and soil conditions the optimal irrigation and nitrogen application rates may vary in different regions in addition most previous studies mainly focus on no3 n leaching loss caused by irrigation during the crop growth period little attention has been paid to no3 n leaching loss caused by autumn irrigation so the annual total no3 n leaching and its potential risk to environmental pollution may be underestimated therefore in order to alleviate the low water and nitrogen use efficiency and serious non point source pollution caused by excessive irrigation and fertilization it is important to accurately evaluate the total no3 n leaching and search an appropriate irrigation and nitrogen application strategy for crops e g wheat in the wlslw we hypothesized that the traditional irrigation and nitrogen application rates for spring wheat fields were the same in the wlslw the main research objectives are 1 to investigate the impact of irrigation and nitrogen application on soil available water and nitrogen status grain yield and water and nitrogen use efficiency of spring wheat farmland 2 to quantitatively evaluate the annual no3 n leaching loss of surface irrigated spring wheat farmland 3 to propose an appropriate irrigation and nitrogen application strategy for spring wheat in the arid agricultural watershed of northwest china 2 materials and method 2 1 experimental site description field experiments were conducted at the fenzidi experimental station in the wlslw in 2019 and 2020 the experimental station is located in the northern part of wlslw latitude 41 09 n longitude 107 39 e with an average elevation of 1031 m the climatic condition in the study area is a semi arid temperate continental climate characterized by sufficient sunshine a large temperature difference between day and night and the annual average temperature of 6 8 the annual precipitation is around 160 240 mm with significant seasonality the annual reference evapotranspiration et0 is about 800 1200 mm and the et0 during the growth season of spring wheat is about 400 550 mm the reference evapotranspiration was estimated by the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 soils were classified as a silt loam soil at the depth of 0 70 cm and loamy soil at the depth of 70 100 cm according to the us textural classification shirazi and boersma 1984 the average organic matter content of 0 100 cm soil is 14 33 g kg 1 detailed physical and chemical properties of soils in the study site are presented in table 1 li et al 2020 a miniature weather station hobo u30 usa was installed in the test field and the meteorological data precipitation and air temperature were recorded every 30 min the groundwater table was monitored with an automatic water level logger buried in an observation well within the experimental field the meteorological data precipitation and air temperature and groundwater table during the spring wheat growth periods in 2019 and 2020 are shown in fig 1 the precipitation during the growth period in 2019 and 2020 was 14 mm and 42 2 mm respectively and the groundwater depth was between 1 and 2 7 m 2 2 experimental design and field management the experimental design was completely randomized in considering the two factors of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization in the 2019 and 2020 growth seasons the experiments included three irrigation levels i e high water i1 450 mm medium water i2 315 mm and low water i3 180 mm and two nitrogen fertilization rates i e high nitrogen n1 340 kg ha 1 and low nitrogen n3 170 kg ha 1 there were six treatments i e i1n1 i2n1 i3n1 i1n3 i2n3 and i3n3 in addition a treatment with a medium nitrogen application rate i e n2 250 kg ha 1 and medium water level was also considered in 2020 among these treatments i1n1 is the control treatment corresponding to the local farmer practices each treatment had three replications each test plot had an area of 175 m2 with a length of 25 m and a width of 7 m a buffer zone with a width of 10 m was set up surrounding the experimental plots to avoid the influence of irrigation and fertilization from the nearby areas the field ridges with a height of 0 4 m and a width of 0 6 m were built and surrounded each plot to minimize the horizontal interference of adjacent plots water was applied to field with surface irrigation and the amount of irrigation in each plot was measured by the water meter lxs 25e china the 3 irrigations were carried out on may 10th may 21th and june 18th in 2019 and on may 10th may 21th and june 18th in 2020 respectively the average irrigation flow was 18 m3 h 1 and the water depth of each irrigation event for i1 i2 and i3 treatments was 150 105 and 60 mm respectively the test field was leveled before sowing to ensure the irrigation uniformity for each plot the fertilizer was evenly sprayed on soil surface 1 h before irrigation and the method type and time of fertilization were consistent with the local spring wheat production the basal fertilizer was applied in the field before sowing with the same amount of phosphate p and potassium k and nitrogen n in all treatment plots the p k and n application amounts for each plot were 95 95 and 50 kg ha 1 respectively 60 of the remaining nitrogen fertilization was applied at the tillering stage and the other 40 was used at the jointing stage the p k and n fertilizers were diammonium phosphate p 50 potassium oxide k 50 and urea n 46 table 2 shows the specific water and fertilizer treatments according to the local agricultural practices autumn irrigation with a depth of about 250 mm was implemented in november each year the purpose of autumn irrigation was to control soil salinity at a low level the average ec of the 0 100 cm soil layer was about 240 μs cm 1 after salt leaching so that the crop growth in the next season was not affected by salinity in addition autumn irrigation also produced a large amount of nitrogen leaching thus the difference of soil water and nitrogen content among the treatments was not significant at the beginning of the growth season the tested wheat cultivar was the yongliang no 4 which was widely planted in the wlslw the wheat was sowed on march 15th and harvested on july 20th in two experimental seasons the division of spring wheat growth stages in 2019 and 2020 is shown in table 3 the planting row spacing was 15 cm and the planting density was about 6 03 106 plants per hectare cultivation planting density and pest and disease management were the same as the local farmer practices 2 3 sample collection and measurement before sowing soil samples were taken from 0 to 100 cm soil depth according to the soil profile layering for soil physical and chemical properties analysis see table 1 then during wheat growing season soil samples from each plot were collected in a 10 day interval for soil water content nh4 n and no3 n determination soil sampling was performed at 10 cm intervals down to 20 cm and 20 cm intervals down to 100 cm soil depth using an auger soil water content was measured by the gravimetric method soil organic matter was measured using the potassium dichromate volumetric external heating method soil solution was extracted from the mixture of soil and 2 mol l 1 kcl solution at a ratio of 1 5 the solutions were then measured within 48 h for determining nh4 n and no3 n content using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv 3100 china sakamoto et al 2009 a similar method as that applied by li et al 2020 was also used for soil no3 n leaching measurement a steel bucket called leakage bucket consisting of a cylinder with a height of 100 cm and a diameter of 40 cm and a cone container with a height of 40 cm was buried in the middle of each plot the 100 cm cylinder of bucket was filled with soil at the same bulk density as that in the field and the conical part was emptied to collect the percolated soil solution the percolated solution was pumped 48 h after each irrigation and rainfall event until the leakage bucket was completely emptied and the volume and the concentration of inorganic nitrogen of the percolated solution were measured accordingly the soil solution collected in the seepage bucket was only used to quantitatively describe the amount of inorganic nitrogen leaching caused by the downward water flow in with irrigation and rainfall therefore the capillary compensation effect of groundwater was not considered at harvest the wheat plants from a 1 m2 area in each plot were cut off to measure the aboveground dry biomass these plants were first dried at 105 c for 1 h to inactivate the enzyme then they were dried at the temperature of 75 c to a constant weight this weight was recorded as the aboveground dry biomass per unit area for the corresponding treatment plot ten dried plant samples from each plot were selected and ground to 0 5 mm with an ultra micro crusher xl 30c china 50 0 mg plant samples were weighted and the plant samples were tightly wrapped in tin foil cones and then they were placed into an automatic injection tray of element analyzer vario macro cn german the analysis mode was set to cn the nitrogen content n ratio in plants was determined using the dry combustion method with element analyzer in addition with the same sampling method of mon et al 2016 peng et al 2019 and zhou 2020 the wheat plants in another 1 m2 area of each plot undisturbed by conventional samplings were also harvested for the measurement of grain yield and its components i e the ears per unit area kernel per ear and 1000 kernel weight the grains with a water content of 14 were considered as the standard yield of wheat 2 4 calculation and statistical analysis soil water storage in each growth stage can be

difference among treatments was determined by the least significant difference lsd at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil water storage and available nitrogen accumulation table 4 shows soil water storage at different growth stages for different treatments in 2019 and 2020 compared with i3 irrigation treatment except for the seeding stage i2 and i1 irrigation treatments increased the soil water storage by 6 15 in the tillering stage 8 20 in the jointing stage 0 1 19 in the heading stage 13 22 in the filling stage and 10 20 in the mature stage respectively there was no significant difference in soil water storage between i2 and i1 irrigation treatments however the nitrogen application rate had no significant impact on soil water storage at each growth stage the depletion of soil water storage in root zone 0 100 cm during the whole growth season for different treatments is presented in fig 2 it can be found that soil water depletion showed an increasing trend with the decrease of irrigation depth and the increase of nitrogen application table 5 shows soil available nitrogen at different growth stages for different treatments in 2019 and 2020 the results indicated that the effects of irrigation on soil available nitrogen were different for different stages from the seeding stage to the jointing stage there was no significant difference in root zone soil available nitrogen among the irrigation treatments however from the heading stage to the mature stage soil available nitrogen showed an increasing trend with the increase of irrigation depth the impacts of nitrogen application on soil available nitrogen were similar in different growth stages except for the seeding stage compared with n3 nitrogen application treatment n1 nitrogen application treatment obviously increased soil available nitrogen by 2 47 in tillering stage 19 72 in the jointing stage 17 140 in the heading stage 30 258 in the filling stage and 1 43 in the mature stage respectively in the 2019 and 2020 seasons whereas there was no obvious difference in soil available nitrogen between n1 and n2 nitrogen application treatments 3 2 no3 n leaching the cumulative no3 n leaching in 2019 and 2020 for different treatments is shown in fig 3 the value of cumulative no3 n leaching was in the range of 30 44 kg ha 1 in 2019 and 31 46 kg ha 1 in 2020 no3 n leaching during the growth season showed a decreasing trend with the decrease of irrigation depth and nitrogen application in addition 250 mm autumn irrigation resulted in a large amount of no3 n leaching for example with autumn irrigation no3 n leaching loss was in the range of 36 40 kg ha 1 in 2019 and 43 65 kg ha 1 in 2020 see fig 3c and d for the control treatment i e i1n1 the total no3 n leaching loss i e full anniversary no3 n leaching caused by growing season irrigations and autumn irrigation after harvest were 84 kg ha 1 in 2019 and 110 kg ha 1 in 2020 this indicated that about 25 32 of the applied nitrogen was leached out of the root zone compared with the control one the i2n2 and i3n3 irrigation and nitrogen application treatments reduced the full anniversary no3 n leaching by 32 and 39 respectively these results showed that reasonably reducing the irrigation depth and nitrogen application rate can effectively decrease no3 n leaching in addition the annual no3 n leaching in 2020 was 12 32 higher than that in 2019 the difference of no3 n leaching between the two experimental years might be attributed to the climatic variation 3 3 plant biomass and nitrogen uptake the aboveground dry biomass at harvest in 2019 and 2020 for different treatments is shown in fig 4 the aboveground dry biomass showed a decreasing trend with the decrease of irrigation depth and nitrogen application the control treatment obtained the highest dry biomass with values of 18 000 kg ha 1 in 2019 and 21 000 kg ha 1 in 2020 there was no difference in the aboveground dry biomass between the i2n2 irrigation and nitrogen application treatment and the control treatment compared with the i3n3 irrigation and nitrogen application treatment the i2n2 irrigation and nitrogen application treatment increased the aboveground dry biomass by 22 the impact of irrigation and nitrogen application on wheat nitrogen uptake was consistent with that of irrigation on the aboveground dry biomass fig 4c and d the control treatment obtained the highest nitrogen uptake of 325 kg ha 1 in 2019 and 323 kg ha 1 in 2020 moreover the i2n2 irrigation and nitrogen application treatment also obtained a high nitrogen uptake of 322 kg ha 1 these results indicated that the effects of the i2n2 irrigation and nitrogen application treatment on dry biomass production and wheat nitrogen uptake were almost the same as those of the control treatment 3 4 grain yield and yield components the anova and percentage of variance for the ears per unit area kernel per ear 1000 kernel weight and grain yield are shown in table 6 the results indicated that the anovas explained a range of total variability extending from 49 44 1000 kernel weight to 83 91 kernel per ear with an average of 70 79 these results generally showed that wheat grain yield and yield components were affected by irrigation fertilization and climate in addition irrigation explained the greatest amount of variability 36 42 for grain yield followed by the year 22 21 and nitrogen application 12 37 which indicated that grain yield was mainly influenced by irrigation followed by climatic variation and nitrogen application the above results indicated that yield production in this area was more sensitive to water than nitrogen wheat grain yield and yield components for different irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer treatments are shown in table 7 the value of grain yield was in the range of 5382 3 7125 1 kg ha 1 in 2019 and 6386 8 8078 3 kg ha 1 in 2020 compared with i3 irrigation treatment i1 irrigation treatment significantly increased grain yield by about 17 there was no significant difference in grain yield between i1 and i2 irrigation treatments the effect of irrigation on yield components ears per unit area kernel per ear and 1000 kernel weight was consistent with that of irrigation on grain yield n1 nitrogen application treatment had a higher grain yield than n3 nitrogen application treatment for i2 irrigation depth in 2020 wheat grain yield first increased and then decreased as nitrogen application increased and n2 nitrogen application treatment obtained the highest grain yield of 8078 3 kg ha 1 the effect of nitrogen application on kernel per ear and 1000 kernel weight was consistent with that of nitrogen application on grain yield these results indicated that the i3n3 irrigation and nitrogen application treatment was deficient in water and nitrogen for wheat production in addition the grain yield observed between i1 and i2 irrigation treatments had no significant difference compared with n2 nitrogen application treatment n1 nitrogen application treatment reduced grain yield these results suggested that the irrigation depth of i1 and nitrogen application of n1were excessive for wheat production in the study area furthermore the grain yield in 2020 was 7 19 higher than that in 2019 and compared with 2019 the differences in grain yield among different nitrogen treatments in 2020 were relatively small the difference of grain yield between the two experimental years might be attributed to the climatic variation 3 5 water and nitrogen use efficiency the wue of wheat showed an increasing trend with the decrease of irrigation depth table 7 compared with i1 irrigation treatment i2 and i3 irrigation treatments increased wue by 14 21 and 36 46 respectively compared with n1 and n3 nitrogen application treatment n2 nitrogen application treatment increased wue by 13 and 25 respectively whereas there was no significant difference of wue between n1 and n3 nitrogen application treatments this result indicated that appropriate irrigation and fertilization can effectively improve wue for example the i2n2 irrigation and nitrogen application treatment obtained a high wue of 18 56 kg ha 1 mm 1 which was about 33 higher than the wue for the control one the pfpn of wheat increased with the increase in irrigation depth table 7 compared with i3 irrigation treatment i1 and i2 irrigation treatments significantly increased pfpn there was no significant difference in pfpn between i1 and i2 irrigation treatments this result indicated that over irrigation could not significantly improve pfpn in addition reducing nitrogen application significantly increased pfpn of wheat the n2 and n3 nitrogen application treatments both obtained high pfpn values which were significantly higher than the pfpn for the n1 nitrogen application treatment however the n3 nitrogen application treatment was deficient in nitrogen for wheat production 3 6 correlations between soil water nitrogen and yield the mic and linear regression analyses were performed between the yield and soil water storage and soil available nitrogen at the tillering jointing heading and filling stages the results are listed in table 8 the mic values between the soil water storage at the tillering stage and ears per m2 and grain yield were 0 66 and 0 65 respectively this result indicated that the soil water storage at the tillering stage was closely related to the ears per unit area and grain yield the mic value showed the relationship between two factors without implying the type of association further analysis showed that there was a significant positive linear relationship between the soil water storage at the tillering stage and ears per m2 and grain yield see fig 5a and g the mic values between the soil water storage at the jointing and heading stages and the ears per m2 kernel per ear and grain yield and between the soil water storage at the filling stage and the 1000 kernel weight and grain yield were both larger than 0 5 it was also found that there was a significant positive linear relationship between the soil water storage at the jointing and heading stages and the ears per m2 kernel per ear and grain yield see fig 5b e h and i and there was a significant positive linear relationship between the soil water storage at the filling stage and the 1000 kernel weight and grain yield see fig 5f and j in addition there was a close correlation between the soil available nitrogen at the jointing stage and the kernel per ear and grain yield further analysis found a significant positive linear relationship between the soil available nitrogen at the jointing stage and the kernel per ear and grain yield see fig 5k and l however the soil available nitrogen at other growth stages had little impact on yield components and grain yield the above results indicated that sufficient water supply from the tillering stage to the filling stage can increase wheat grain yield by increasing the number and the weight of grains per unit area the higher soil available nitrogen at the jointing stage can increase the grain yield by increasing the kernel per ear 4 discussion 4 1 impact of irrigation on soil water storage increasing irrigation depth to some extent can increase soil water storage in the root zone but continuously increasing the irrigation depth is invaluable for soil water storage the reason for this result is that over irrigation may cause soil water content to exceed the field capacity thereby leads to deep percolation without significantly increase the soil water storage bethune et al 2008 li et al 2020 this result is in agreement with the findings of many previous studies wan et al 2018 wu et al 2019 this result demonstrates that there is a relatively large space for reducing the irrigation depth for spring wheat farmland in the wlslw therefore compared with the local practices i e i1 irrigation depth the appropriate irrigation practices with an irrigation depth of i2 can save 6 4 107 m3 irrigation water annually based on the spring wheat planting area of 4 7 104 ha 4 2 impact of irrigation and fertilization on soil available nitrogen accumulation and no3 n leaching increasing the irrigation depth usually increases nitrogen leaching thereby reducing soil available nitrogen accumulation in the root zone in this study increasing irrigation depth significantly decreased soil available nitrogen from the heading stage to the mature stage see table 5 this finding is primarily because no3 n was leached out of the wheat root zone by the three irrigations at the tillering jointing and heading stages and was also taken up by the wheat no3 n leaching and wheat nitrogen uptake was significantly increased with the increase of irrigation depth see figs 3a b and 4c d thereby decreased the soil available nitrogen du et al 2011 this result agrees with earlier studies of wang et al 2010 and lu et al 2019 who found that increasing irrigation depth increased inorganic nitrogen leaching and decreased soil nitrogen accumulation however there is no significant difference in soil available nitrogen among the different irrigation depth treatments at the tillering and jointing stages the reason for this result may be that no3 n was not leached out the 0 100 cm soil layer in a short period right after irrigations in addition the no3 n leaching in 2020 was higher than that in 2019 the reason for this result is that in 2020 the precipitation from wheat planting to the end of autumn irrigation was 68 mm higher than that in 2019 the higher precipitation resulted in higher deep percolation causing larger no3 n leaching many previous studies showed that increasing nitrogen fertilizer application can increase soil available nitrogen in the root zone and no3 n leaching shi et al 2012 he et al 2016 in this study soil available nitrogen significantly increased with the increase of nitrogen application from the tillering stage to the mature stage after topdressing see table 5 meanwhile no3 n leaching also showed an increasing trend with the increase of nitrogen application see fig 3a and b the result agrees with earlier studies of he et al 2016 and chen et al 2020 who found that compared with the low nitrogen application treatments high nitrogen application treatments provided more sources for soil available nitrogen supplementation lu et al 2019 also found that higher available nitrogen accumulation in soils increased the risk of nitrate leaching to groundwater however nitrogen application had no significant impacts on soil available nitrogen at the seedling stage and this might be attributed to that the basal fertilizer application was the same among the treatments no3 n leaching from root zone soil is a potential risk of surface and ground water pollution in the wlslw so optimizing the irrigation and fertilization strategy is critical to mitigate no3 n leaching for the local framer practices the annual no3 n leaching loss was estimated at about 5 2 106 kg from the wheat fields on the basis of its planting area this leaching amount accounts for about 25 32 of total applied nitrogen due to the local groundwater table being shallow the nitrogen is directly leached out of the root zone and accumulates in groundwater resulting in groundwater pollution part of the no3 n in groundwater gradually gets into the drainage ditches through groundwater flow and then flows through the drainage ditches to the downstream of the wlslw li et al 2020 and finally causes surface water pollution in the wuliangsuhai lake this study confirmed that reasonably reducing the irrigation depth and nitrogen application rate can effectively decrease no3 n leaching compared with the local farmer practices the appropriate irrigation and fertilization practices i e i2n2 can reduce no3 n leaching by about 32 and the total annual no3 n leaching loss from wheat fields of about 1 7 106 kg and can save 30 of total applied water and 27 of total applied nitrogen fertilizers respectively 4 3 impact of irrigation and fertilization on biomass yield and its components irrigation is a main agricultural management measure in arid areas of northern china which can improve soil available water first subsequently promotes wheat growth and ultimately increases biomass and grain yield wang et al 2010 ma and song 2018 the biomass increased with the increase of irrigation depth because increasing irrigation depth increased the root zone soil water storage see table 4 this result agrees with the findings of several previous studies zheng et al 2009 djaman et al 2013 in addition higher soil moisture from the tillering stage to the heading stage improved the ears per m2 and kernel per ear see fig 5a c the reason for this result is that tillering jointing and heading stages are the critical periods in determining the rate of ear and kernel formation adequate water supplies can lead to more available water and nutrients absorbed by wheat plants thereby promoting wheat reproductive development and ultimately increasing the ears and kernel per unit area wang and yu 2008 furthermore higher soil moisture at the filling stage increased the 1000 kernel weight see fig 5f this result agrees with the finding of yan et al 2019 who found that sufficient soil available water at the filling stage significantly increased wheat grain weight since the ears per unit area kernel per ear and 1000 kernel weight are decisive factors for making up wheat yield darroch and baker 1990 lizana et al 2010 therefore its grain yield also increased with the increase of soil water storage from the tillering stage to the filling stage see fig 5g j increasing irrigation depth improved the root zone soil water storage thus the grain yield increased with the increase of irrigation depth but there was no significant difference in biomass and grain yield between i1 and i2 irrigation treatments because over irrigation cannot significantly increase the soil water storage moreover the precipitation during the wheat growth season in 2020 was 28 2 mm higher than that in 2019 which inevitably led to the higher water supply during the wheat growth season in 2020 than that in 2019 this may be the reason that the grain yield in 2020 was higher than that in 2019 nitrogen application is another critical agricultural management measure affecting crops growth and production which can improve soil available nitrogen thereby influencing crop biomass accumulation and yield forde and lorenzo 2001 guan et al 2014 compared with n3 nitrogen application treatment n1 nitrogen application treatment increased the biomass see fig 4a and b the reason may be that increasing nitrogen application increased the root zone soil available nitrogen and thereby more available nitrogen was absorbed by wheat plants and translated into biomass liu et al 2003 guan et al 2014 in addition n1 nitrogen application treatment had a higher grain yield than n3 nitrogen application treatment because increasing nitrogen application increased the kernel per ear by increasing the soil available nitrogen see fig 5k and l this result is in agreement with the findings of many previous studies song et al 2016 2019 however excessive soil nitrogen content in the late growth stage was not conducive to wheat plant reproductive development riley et al 2001 jiang et al 2016 therefore the 1000 kernel weight and grain yield first increased with the increase of nitrogen application from n3 to n2 and then decreased with the increase of nitrogen application from n2 and n1 whereas there was little difference in biomass between n1 and n2 nitrogen application treatments the result agrees with earlier studies of yang et al 2001 and liang et al 2017 who found that excessive nitrogen application inhibited grain filling and caused lodging thereby resulting in biomass and grain loss moreover compared with 2019 the differences in wheat yield among different nitrogen treatments in 2020 were relatively small the main reason for this result may be that the precipitation during the wheat growth season in 2020 was higher than that in 2019 and relatively adequate water supply may alleviate the inhibitory effect of reduced nitrogen fertilization on wheat grain yield min et al 2016 yin et al 2016 4 4 impact of irrigation and fertilization on water and nitrogen use efficiency reasonable water and nitrogen management strategies can reduce water percolation and improve soil water use in the root zone ultimately increasing the wue li et al 2002 sun et al 2018a in our study over irrigation significantly reduced wheat wue while decreasing the irrigation depth increased wue the reason for this result is that on the one hand decreasing the irrigation depth may reduce deep percolation and on the other hand decreasing the irrigation depth can increase soil water depletion to supplement insufficient irrigation water this then results in a slight grain yield loss but a relatively large reduction of actual evapotranspiration and thus ultimately increases wue this result is in agreement with the findings of many previous studies yang et al 2009 xue et al 2014 additionally compared with low nitrogen application treatment high nitrogen application treatment increased wue because increasing nitrogen application can promote crop root growth and enhance the root water absorption and ultimately improve wue zhao et al 2003 that is also why increasing nitrogen application increased soil water depletion see fig 2 the above results revealed why wue increased with the increase of soil water storage depletion see fig 6a this means that appropriately reducing irrigation and increasing nitrogen fertilization can increase soil water utilization by wheat and thus improve wue this result agrees with the earlier study of zhang et al 2019 who found that increasing soil water storage consumption could improve wue reasonable irrigation and fertilization can promote the uptake of fertilizer nitrogen and soil nitrogen by wheat thereby increasing the nitrogen use efficiency kaiser et al 2010 our study showed that low irrigation depth significantly reduced wheat pfpn while increasing irrigation depth improved pfpn the reason for this result was that low irrigation depth e g i3 irrigation depth might result in water stress and inhibit plant growth and nitrogen uptake brockley 1981 increasing the irrigation depth alleviated the water stress first subsequently rapidly increased the wheat nitrogen uptake and ultimately increased pfpn see fig 6b dashed circle a similar result was obtained by mon et al 2016 in contrast under sufficient water conditions e g i1 and i2 irrigation depth nitrogen application had little impact on wheat nitrogen uptake mon et al 2016 shi et al 2012 therefore there was little difference in wheat nitrogen uptake among the nitrogen application treatments see the solid circles in fig 6b this result indicated that under the sufficient water conditions appropriately reducing the nitrogen application can decrease the nitrogen loss without affecting crop nitrogen uptake therefore the pfpn increased with the decrease of nitrogen application this result agrees with many previous studies shi et al 2012 wang et al 2016 the above results indicate that under water deficient conditions increasing irrigation depth can increase pfpn by improving the plants nitrogen uptake whereas under water sufficient conditions appropriately reducing nitrogen fertilizer application is an effective way to increase pfpn 4 5 irrigation and fertilization strategies for wheat appropriate water and nitrogen management strategies should consider grain yield water and nitrogen use efficiency economic benefits and environmental pollution risks caused by nitrate leaching in the wlslw excessive irrigation and nitrogen application had caused low water and nitrogen use efficiency low grain yield low net profit and high no3 n leaching loss however our study found that appropriately reducing the irrigation depth and the fertilization rate can effectively mitigate these problems for example reducing the irrigation depth from i1 450 mm to i2 315 mm and nitrogen application from n1 340 kg ha 1 to n2 250 kg ha 1 reduced the no3 n leaching by 32 increased grain yield wue pfpn and net profit by 6 33 44 and 6 respectively furthermore under similar nitrogen application conditions compared with the 150 210 mm irrigation depth recommended by zhang et al 2013 and li et al 2015 in this area the i2 irrigation treatment in this study increased yield and wue by about 7 20 and 4 14 respectively and under similar irrigation conditions compared with the 120 180 kg ha 1 nitrogen application rate recommended by dong et al 2011 and jia et al 2020 in this area the n2 nitrogen application treatment in this study reduced nue slightly and increased the yield and wue by 14 50 and 13 15 respectively therefore comprehensively considering yield wue nue economic benefits and environment impacts border irrigation with a depth of 315 mm and nitrogen fertilization with a rate of 250 kg ha 1 is regarded as an appropriate irrigation and fertilization strategy for spring wheat production in the arid agricultural watershed of northwest china although the effect of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization on crops grain yield and water and nitrogen use efficiency had been widely reported previous studies have obtained different results about the recommended irrigation depth and fertilization rate for wheat production this may be attributed to the issues that on the one hand different regions have different climate and soil conditions and on the other hand the best economic benefit and or the highest grain yield are considered as the sole objective of crop production whereas the multiple objectives with a reasonable economic benefit and or grain yield while with the lowest negative environmental and ecological impacts are pursued by different levels of government agencies for example in the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system in the weishan irrigation district at the lower yellow river basin an irrigation depth of 300 mm and a nitrogen application of 611 kg ha 1 were implemented by farmers to obtain the highest crops yield and net income but the government agencies recommend irrigation depth of 240 mm and nitrogen application of 458 kg ha 1 to control nitrogen leaching for reducing the risk of agricultural non point source pollution while maintaining high yield and net income tang et al 2015 in the north china plain farmers generally use excessive water and fertilizers with an irrigation depth of 285 375 mm and nitrogen application of 250 kg ha 1 to obtain the highest grain yield but comprehensively considering yield economic benefits and water and nitrogen use efficiency the irrigation depth of 240 260 mm and the nitrogen application of 210 kg ha 1 are recommended for winter wheat chen et al 2007 due to the limitations of field experiments this study can only obtain a relatively appropriate irrigation depth and fertilization strategy therefore further study is required to obtain an optimal irrigation and fertilization strategy using both the field trial tests and numerical simulations with considering both the economic and environmental benefits 5 conclusion increasing irrigation depth increased root zone soil available water but over irrigation was not useful for soil water storage and caused significant no3 n leaching whereas increasing nitrogen application significantly enhanced available nitrogen content in root zone soils in general the local farmer practices i1n1 for spring wheat resulted in higher no3 n leaching reducing irrigation depth to i2 and nitrogen application rate to n2 could effectively reduce no3 n leaching loss as well as maintaining grain yield and improved water and nitrogen use efficiency and net profit by taking this changed irrigation and fertilization practice for spring wheat in the wlslw about 6 4 107 m3 irrigation water can be saved and 1 7 106 tons of nitrogen will not be imposed on the water environment it can be concluded that the strategy with 315 mm irrigation and 250 kg ha 1 nitrogen application is recommendable for spring wheat in the arid agricultural watershed of northwest china and those areas with the reference evapotranspiration in a range of 400 550 mm during the growth season and the average organic matter content of root zone soil a value of about 14 g kg 1 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

pursue high yield zhang et al 2018 this common agricultural practice not only wastes water resources but also reduces crop quality water is essential to growth of sweet pepper and other crops crops absorb soil water through roots and maintain normal physiological functions of organs above ground chandra and singh 2017 appropriate increase of irrigation amount can improve fruit yield total biomass and nitrogen use efficiency kabir et al 2021 excessive soil water lowers wue while severe water deficit inhibits crop growth and reduces crop yield biomass and harvest index shao et al 2010 however appropriate water stress exercise during crop growth and development can remarkably enhance root water uptake efficiencies leaves receive the root signal to adjust stomatal aperture to maintain the optimal opening which can greatly reduce the crop transpiration without sacrificing the accumulation of crop photosynthetic products dorji and behboudian 2005 a reasonable irrigation treatment can largely improve crop leaf area index promote the accumulation and transfer of crop biomass improve the photosynthetic assimilation ability of crops and promote the growth and development of crop groups du et al 2017 kabir et al 2021 fertilizer is another critical to growth of crops such as sweet pepper aminifard et al 2012 ortas 2013 wu et al 2015 yasuor et al 2013 suggested that a nitrogen concentration of 56 2 mg l was most favorable to nutrients absorption and utilization for sweet pepper under drip irrigation without residual nitrogen pollution or reduce sweet pepper yield and quality due to malnutrition bar tal et al 2001 reported that nutrient solution nitrogen concentration affects sweet pepper growth and the optimal nitrogen concentration for above ground dry matter was 9 2 m mol l excessive fertilization leads to the decrease of fertilizer use efficiency the increase of production cost and nutrient loss delang and claudio 2017 cassman et al 2002 and halvorson et al 2008 showed that excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer promotes soil nitrate transport to groundwater and n2o diffusion to the air therefore it is very important to determine a reasonable irrigation and fertilization management system the coupling of water and nitrogen has greatly affect crop yield growth wue and fertilizer use efficiency hong et al 2021 the coupling effects of water and nitrogen both interact and inhibit each other and appropriate water supply can increase the nitrogen harvest index plaut et al 2004 xu et al 2010 hong et al 2021 under reasonable water treatments increasing fertilizer can increase chlorophyll content by promoting photosynthesis and thus yield proper control of water and nitrogen supplies can maintain high crop growth rates and improve wue and yield yang et al 2014 du et al 2017 li et al 2018 wang et al 2018 however previous studies mainly focused on cucumber wang et al 2019a 2019b tomato xing et al 2015 maize zou et al 2020 and other crops there is a lack of research on the organic unity and synchronous utilization of water and fertilizer on sweet pepper furthermore the multi objective optimization of water and nitrogen management based on yield water and nitrogen use efficiency and quality of sweet pepper is rare therefore a consecutive two year experiment was carried out on greenhouse sweet pepper under drip fertigation in the guanzhong plain of china the main objectives were to 1 understand the response of the yield quality water and fertilizer utilization efficiency of sweet pepper to different water and nitrogen regimes 2 clarify the incentive mechanism of wue and nitrogen mobilization and the synergistic effect of water nitrogen application and plant water nitrogen uptake 3 optimize the water and nitrogen management strategy with high quality yield and water nitrogen use efficiency the study aims to provide specific technical supports to optimize water and fertilizer management in facility cultivation and serves as a theoretical basis for the high quality efficient and large scale production of greenhouse sweet pepper in northwest china 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental materials the experiments were

combination and a total of 48 plots the area of each field plot was 8 40 m2 6 70 m 1 25 m the local typical furrows covered with film were adopted the height and width of ridge were 25 cm and 75 cm respectively the ridge top was made into flat and the ridge spacing was 50 cm to prevent the interaction of water and fertilizer between neighboring plots the plots were separated by burying cells in 1 m deep soil layer with plastic film drip irrigation pipes were arranged between two rows of sweet pepper with 45 cm plant spacing and 30 cm row spacing individual planting was used with a planting

irrigation and fertilization are shown in table 2 american c annuum marco capsicum annuum l var grossum marco f1 was used in this study because it is suitable for greenhouse production the shape of

significant difference in the fruit yield between the two treatments and the same years w3n3 treatment under the same irrigation amount the fruit yield showed a single peak trend with the increase of nitrogen application rates and there was no significant difference between n1 and n4 levels indicating that excessive and low nitrogen application rates reduce fruit yield in the two year experiment

because sweet pepper is one of the important natural sources of vitamin c and soluble sugar which determine the taste of sweet pepper nitrate content of greenhouse vegetables is much higher than that of open air vegetables which is not conducive to human health thereby affecting the quality and nutritional value of sweet pepper therefore the contents of soluble sugar vitamin c and nitrate were used as the quality indexes of sweet pepper in this study the irrigation water amount and nitrogen application rate had significant effects on soluble sugar content of sweet pepper table 4 in the two year experiment under the same irrigation level the soluble sugar content of sweet pepper increased first and then decreased with the increase of nitrogen application rate and achieved a maximum at n3 level followed by n2 level under the same nitrogen application rate the soluble sugar content of sweet pepper decreased with the increase of the level of irrigation while there were no significant

sweet pepper in greenhouse were significant table 4 with the increasing irrigation level the nitrate content of sweet pepper increased under the same nitrogen application rate in the two year experiment except the w2 level in 2014 there was no significant difference between n4 and n3 treatment at each irrigation level however except the w2 level in 2014 the nitrate content of n4 level was significantly lower than that of n2 level at each irrigation level under the same nitrogen application rate the nitrate content of sweet pepper decreased with the increase of the irrigation level water except n4 level at n3 and n4 levels there was no significant difference in nitrate content between w1 and w3 levels in the two year experiment the nitrate content of sweet pepper reached the

year 3 5 coupling effect of water and fertilizer on sweet pepper yield wue pfpn and quality to pursue high yield efficiency quality and sustainable production of sweet pepper in solar greenhouses this study used yield wue nitrogen partial factor productivity pfpn and quality as evaluation indexes to comprehensively evaluate the coupling effect of water and nitrogen on sweet pepper water and nitrogen amounts were independent variables yield wue pfpn vitamin c and soluble sugar content were response variables based on the least square method mathematica 9 0 software was used to analyze the test data and binary quadratic regression equations were established to calculate the amounts of water and nitrogen needed to maximize the above parameters table 5 then the optimal systems of single indexes were solved and the amounts of water and nitrogen corresponding to the optimal solution of each index in the confidence interval were obtained the results showed that the influence of water and nitrogen input on the dependent variables reached a very significant level p 0 01 table 5 the amounts of irrigation and nitrogen application corresponding to the maximum value of each index were shown in table 5 as showed in table 5 it was difficult to obtain the maximum yield wue pfpn vitamin c and soluble sugar content simultaneously in 2014 the maximum sweet pepper yield of 34 9 t ha was obtained when 230 5 mm of irrigation water and 185 6 kg ha of nitrogen were applied while the largest wue of 17 0 kg m3 was obtained when 213 1 mm of irrigation water and 187 0 kg ha of nitrogen were applied the pfpn was maximized at 333 0 kg kg with the application of 248 0 mm of irrigation water and 75 kg ha of nitrogen while the maximum content of vitamin c was obtained when 221 3 mm of irrigation water and 189 0 kg ha of nitrogen were applied and the maximum soluble sugar content of 41 5 was obtained when 167 8 mm of irrigation water and 183 9 kg ha of nitrogen were applied table 5 in 2015 the maximum sweet pepper yield of 34 4 t ha could be obtained when 216 2 mm of irrigation water and 193 5 kg ha of nitrogen were applied while the largest wue of 17 3 kg m3 was obtained when 190 1 mm of irrigation water and 192 6 kg ha of nitrogen were applied the pfpn was maximized at 319 5 kg kg with the application of 222 0 mm of irrigation water and 75 kg ha of nitrogen whilst the maximum content of vitamin c of 192 9 mg 100 g was obtained when 207 2 mm of irrigation water and 189 5 kg ha of nitrogen were applied and the maximum soluble sugar content of 42 1 was obtained when 158 3 mm of irrigation water and 191 3 kg ha of nitrogen were applied table 5 because the yield wue pfpn vitamin c and soluble sugar content cannot be maximized simultaneously for 2014 and 2015 some decisions have to be made in the actual planting of sweet pepper therefore it is necessary to further analyze and investigate the water and nitrogen input combination to obtain the best indicators the coupling effects of water and nitrogen inputs on the sweet pepper yield wue and vitamin c content of sweet pepper in the two year experiment exhibited a downward convex shape and the coupling effect of pfpn exhibited a decreasing tendency the coupling effect of soluble sugar content was a downward convex shape with downward opening and increasing with the decrease of irrigation amount figs 4 and 5 considering some indicators had the similar fertilization range some indicator had small interaction range we did not consider pfpn and soluble sugar content in the comprehensive evaluation the acceptable regions of 95 90 85 80 and 75 of yield wue and vitamin c content were analyzed we found that 95 and 90 acceptable ranges of yield deviated too far from 95 and 90 acceptable ranges of wue and vitamin c content it was impossible to find their overlapping ranges the yield wue and vitamin c content in the 80 and 75 acceptable regions could be found in some overlapping ranges while the indicators deviated too much from their extreme values we also found that the overlapping ranges could be achieved at the acceptable range of 85 simultaneously and the ranges of the three indicators were similar therefore the ranges of greater than or equal to the 85 were considered a reasonable acceptable range figs 4 and 5 based on the analysis of mathematic 9 0 the optimal solutions were found in the best confidence intervals of 85 the yield wue and vitamin c content could achieve the ranges of greater than or equal to the 85 reasonable acceptable range simultaneously at the irrigation water and nitrogen amount of 195 9 212 9 mm is the 78 2 85 0 of etc and 190 5 209 8 kg ha in 2014 while 160 7 185 1 mm 71 3 80 8 etc and 164 5 189 5 kg ha in 2015 respectively considering comprehensively all factors such as meteorological condition of the two different hydrological years 2014 and 2015 under the treatments of this study the sweet pepper yield wue and vitamin c content could achieve the optimal value of 85 simultaneously at the irrigation water and nitrogen application ranges of 78 2 80 8 etc and 164 5 189 5 kg ha respectively table 6 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation amount and nitrogen rate on yield above ground dry matter and hi soil moisture is the basis of soil nutrient release and fertilization can improve water use efficiency of crops nakamura et al 2005 suitable water and fertilizer supply has a significant positive coupling effect on crop yield leading to increased total above ground dry matter and hi yang et al 2014 du et al 2017 kabir et al 2021 irrigation amount has a great impact on crop growth and yield wang et al 2019a 2019b si et al 2020 in this study the yield of sweet pepper increased first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation amount and both the highest w1 and lowest w4 irrigation amounts inhibited sweet pepper yield which was similar the finding of previous studies on broccoli erdem et al 2010 and tomato li et al 2020 appropriate water deficit can promote crop yield however severe water stress cannot meet crop growth need resulting in lower crop yield zhang et al 2018 excessive soil moisture will increase the stem and leaf of crops increases nutritional competition between vegetative organs and fruits and may reduce crop yields lodhi et al 2014 du et al 2017 under the same irrigation amount the crop yield under high nitrogen level n1 and low nitrogen level n4 was close both of which were lower than under n2 and n3 treatments table 3 this finding indicates that nitrogen rates excess or shortage cannot enhance crop yield excessive nitrogen application can promote excessive vegetative growth of plants thereby delaying crop maturity and increasing susceptibility to various diseases and reducing crop yield and productivity hocking et al 1987 du et al 2021 massignam et al 2009 and zou et al 2020 found that nitrogen deficiency results in premature senescence lowers photosynthetic intensity and thus reduces crop yields therefore reasonable water and fertilizer inputs are crucial to improve crop yield our results showed that w2 and w3 irrigation levels and n2 and n3 nitrogen levels were favorable to the accumulation of the total above ground dry matter of sweet pepper which was similar to previous studies sezen et al 2006 gadissa and chemeda 2009 yang et al 2014 showed that increasing irrigation within a certain range was conducive to the accumulation of dry matter in crop above ground consistent with our findings increasing irrigation can alleviate the adverse effects of drought on crop growth to some extent prolong the green holding time of leaves and thus increase the quality of above ground dry matter ierna et al 2011 under suitable water conditions increasing nitrogen level could increase crop growth rate while nitrogen consumption could not produce corresponding relative growth rate and net absorption rate mojaddam et al 2011 in addition previous studies have obtained that vegetables grow best under medium water and nutrient conditions such as watermelon shao et al 2010 xing et al 2015 wang et al 2019a 2019b the change of hi is based on the change of crop yield and dry matter quality under different water and nitrogen conditions hi reflects the ability of photosynthetic product in crop population to transform into economic products xie et al 2011 some studies have shown that severe water stress reduces plant biomass accumulation leading to severe early senescence and decrease in yield and hi yang et al 2000 farooq et al 2014 ünlü et al 2011 and wang et al 2018 revealed that the greatest harvest index was observed under a suitable deficit irrigation amount which was similar to our results under the same irrigation conditions the sweet pepper hi first increased and then decreased with increasing fertilizer rate similar trend was found under the same nitrogen application in the two year experiment hi reached a maximum of 0 66 in the w3n3 treatment in 2014 and 0 69 in the w2n3 treatment in 2015 respectively our study shows that hi is higher under the combination of medium water and medium fertilizer which is consistent with previous studies yan et al 2021 wang et al 2019a 2019b we also found that medium water and fertilizer was a suitable water and fertilizer strategy for sweet pepper in greenhouse 4 2 effects of irrigation amount and nitrogen rate on wue pfpn and fruit quality water and nutrient supplies directly affect plant growth determine the ability of plants to absorb nutrients affect the change and distribution of nutrient content in plants and ultimately influence fruit quality du et al 2017 hong et al 2021 fertilization can improve crop water status and crop water use efficiency but excessive or unpleasant fertilization can reduce crop wue lodhi et al 2014 coupling of water and fertilizer affects crop growth and wue b li et al 2021 h li et al 2021 suitable deficit irrigation can enhance crop yield and wue sezen et al 2006 ozbahce and tari 2010 lodhi et al 2014 wang et al 2019a 2019b found that increasing nitrogen application rates within a certain range improved crop wue which was consistent with our study this may be due to fertilization promoted root growth and canopy development and crops absorbed more soil moisture significantly improved water use efficiency under the condition of constant or little increase intotal water supply li et al 2018 xing et al 2015 kumari et al 2014 indicated that drip fertigation could improve wue of sweet pepper by 94 79 compared with traditional furrow irrigation fertilizer partial productivity is a comprehensive indicator reflecting the local fertilizer application rate and soil basic nutrient level hebbar et al 2004 wu et al 2014 in the two year experiment nitrogen application rate had significant effect on nitrogen use efficiency the average pfpn under high nitrogen level was 75 11 kg kg while the average pfpn under low nitrogen level was 295 89 kg kg similar results was obtained in many field crops xing et al 2015 b li et al 2021 h li et al 2021 and greenhouse crops farneselli et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2019a 2019b despite nitrogen application nitrogen cannot be completely absorbed by crops and thus the nitrogen conversion rate is not 100 yang et al 2007 declared that optimizing water and nitrogen supply can significantly improve nitrogen use efficiency and partial nitrogen productivity under the condition of ensuring yield in this study pfpn was similarly affected by water and fertilizer we found that the effect of fertilization on pfpn was greater than irrigation confirming results of previous studies zhang et al 2018 wu et al 2014 with the improvement of living standards agricultural production not only pursues product output but also demands higher quality the impacts of water and fertilizer on fruit and vegetable quality under drip irrigation have been reported by a number of studies ertek and kara 2013 akhtar et al 2014 wang et al 2019a 2019b previous studies have shown that suitable water and nitrogen supply could not only promote crop growth and fruit development but also improve crop quality without significant decrease in yield du et al 2017 kabir et al 2021 yasuor et al 2013 found that under drip irrigation condition it would not reduce the quality of sweet pepper or produce excess nitrogen to pollute the environment at the nitrogen concentration of 56 2 mg l akhtar et al 2014 showed that reduced irrigation significantly enhanced tomato soluble solids organic acids and vc content despite slight yield reductions compared to full irrigation our results showed that optimizing irrigation and nitrogen management could reduce water and nitrogen input control nitrate content within a certain range and maximize soluble sugar and vc content similar to sezen et al 2006 and xing et al 2015 this study found that it could have a good coupling effect on water and nitrogen in the w3n3 treatment but limited the absorption of fruit nutrition in the w4n4 treatment 4 3 the optimal combination of irrigation amount and nitrogen rate intervals thompson et al 2000 used multiple regression analysis method to comprehensively evaluate the agronomic economic and environmental benefits of drip irrigation and fertilization of cauliflower they obtained that the water and nitrogen ranges corresponding to the near overlapping areas of each index acceptable region the maximum value of 95 were 100 120 mm and 300 400 kg ha respectively xing et al 2015 studied the effects of water and fertilizer combination on root growth yield water and fertilizer use efficiency and quality of greenhouse tomato under drip irrigation fertilization by using multiple regression analysis and spatial analysis wang et al 2019a 2019b considered that the confidence interval of the maximum 90 of cucumber yield wue quality pfpn and other indicators in greenhouse and the optimal drip irrigation interval of 124 151 mm and the nitrogen application interval of 318 504 kg ha it followed that the use of multivariate regression can accurately quantify the optimal value of the target and determine the acceptable areas that meet different requirements rather than compare the change trend and simple size wang et al 2018 zou et al 2020 yan et al 2021 in this study we further analyzed the relationships between sweet pepper yield wue and quality by considering the 85 confidence interval for the maximum values of those parameters based on the analysis of mathematic 9 0 we found that the optimal values of sweet pepper yield wue and quality could be achieved simultaneously at the acceptable range of 85 with irrigation water and nitrogen ranges of 78 2 80 8 etc and 164 5 189 5 kg ha fig 4 these ranges of irrigation water and nitrogen were recommended as the optimal irrigation and fertilization strategy for sustainable sweet pepper production in the study region 5 conclusions at the same fertilization application rate the indexes such as the total of above ground dry matter yield hi and wue iwue of sweet pepper first increased and then decreased with the increase of irrigation amount with maximums at the irrigation levels of 75 etc or 90 etc under the same irrigation amount condition the indexes such as wue and hi increased first and then decreased with the increase of nitrogen application rate reaching the maximum at the fertilization amount of 225 kg ha despite downward trends of the nitrogen related indexes e g npfp the low irrigation level of 60 etc did not enhance fertilizer efficiency while the irrigation level of 75 etc or 90 etc could significantly improve the yield and quality due to the lack of water resources in northwest china 75 etc irrigation and 225 kg ha fertilization are the best fertilization strategies for drip irrigation based on the principle of least square method and mathematica 9 0 analysis each index above cannot reach the maximum at the same time the yield wue and fruit quality of sweet pepper could be achieved the optimal value in the optimal 85 confidence interval with the irrigation level of 78 2 80

same nitrogen irrigation levels the partial factor productivity of nitrogen pfpn decreased significantly with the increase of nitrogen application rate while it increased first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation level the pfpn reached a peak at w2 level despite no significant difference between w2 and w3 levels with the increase of nitrogen application rate soluble sugar and vitamin c content increased first and then decreased with a maximum at n3 level nitrate content increased with the increase of nitrogen application rate and there was no significant difference between n4 and n3 levels the contents of soluble sugar and nitrate nitrogen decreased with the increase of irrigation amount and they did not differ between w1 and w3 levels at n3 level the vitamin c content increased first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation amount reaching the maximum in w2 or w3 treatments considering the shortage of water resources in the study area the w3n3 treatment

transformation the demand for facility agricultural land in china is growing rapidly in northwest china zhou et al 2019 which is rich in light and heat resources and suitable for the development of facility agriculture facility agriculture is an effective way to improve the economy of northwest china rural economic benefits and farmer s living standards zhang and meng 2016 greenhouses are one of the most important facilities for the production of winter spring vegetables all over the world wang et al 2019a 2019b sweet pepper is a common greenhouse vegetable in northwest china is one of the important protected vegetables and has high nutritional value sweet pepper can improve human immunity resistance to cataracts and heart disease and reduce the risk of sarcoidosis in the elderly palacios and seguí simarro 2021 wang et al 2021 sweet pepper is mainly cultivated in north and south china with a planting area of about 50 000 ha stricevic 2015 with the rapid development of agricultural modernization in china drip fertilization has been widely applied fan et al 2017 wang et al 2019a 2019b drip fertilization refers to use plastic tubing to drip water and fertilizer at the base of plants in a regulated way which is an efficient way to attain high yield and high efficiency bar yosef 1999 hu et al 2021 showed that drip fertigation increased water and nitrogen use efficiency and reduced nitrogen leaching relative to the conventional flood irrigation and over fertilization in greenhouse vegetable production compared with farmers traditional practices of irrigation furrowing irrigate and fertilization spreading n fertilizer drip fertigation could significantly decrease crop evapotranspiration by 11 3 enhance higher yields 12 0 and nitrogen use

vegetables xing et al 2015 traditionally famers believe that high crop yield depends on high amount of irrigation water and fertilizer resulting in excessive irrigation and fertilization applied to pursue high yield zhang et al 2018 this common agricultural practice not only wastes water resources but also reduces crop quality water is essential to growth of sweet pepper and other crops crops absorb soil water through roots and maintain normal physiological functions of organs above ground chandra and singh 2017 appropriate increase of irrigation amount can improve fruit yield total biomass and nitrogen use efficiency kabir et al 2021 excessive soil water lowers wue while severe water deficit inhibits crop growth and reduces crop yield biomass and harvest index shao et al 2010 however appropriate water stress exercise during crop growth and development can remarkably enhance root water uptake efficiencies leaves receive the root signal to adjust stomatal aperture to maintain the optimal opening which can greatly reduce the crop transpiration without sacrificing the accumulation of crop photosynthetic products dorji and behboudian 2005 a reasonable irrigation treatment can largely improve crop leaf area index promote the accumulation and transfer of crop biomass improve the photosynthetic assimilation ability of crops and promote the growth and development of crop groups du et al 2017 kabir et al 2021 fertilizer is another critical to growth of crops such as sweet pepper aminifard et al 2012 ortas 2013 wu et al 2015 yasuor et al 2013 suggested that a nitrogen concentration of 56 2 mg l was most favorable to nutrients absorption and utilization for sweet pepper under drip irrigation without residual nitrogen pollution or reduce sweet pepper yield and quality due to malnutrition bar tal et al 2001 reported that nutrient solution nitrogen concentration affects sweet pepper growth and the optimal nitrogen concentration for above ground dry matter was 9 2 m mol l excessive fertilization leads to the decrease of fertilizer use efficiency the increase of production cost and nutrient loss delang and claudio 2017 cassman et al 2002 and halvorson et al 2008 showed that excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer promotes soil nitrate transport to groundwater and n2o diffusion to the air therefore it is very important to determine a reasonable irrigation and fertilization management system the coupling of water and nitrogen has greatly affect crop yield growth wue and fertilizer use efficiency hong et al 2021 the coupling effects of water and nitrogen both interact and inhibit each other and appropriate water supply can increase the nitrogen harvest index plaut et al 2004 xu et al 2010 hong et al 2021 under reasonable water treatments increasing fertilizer can increase chlorophyll content by promoting photosynthesis and thus yield proper control of water and nitrogen supplies can maintain high crop growth rates and improve wue and yield yang et al 2014 du et al 2017 li et al 2018 wang et al 2018 however previous studies mainly focused on cucumber wang et al 2019a 2019b tomato xing et al 2015 maize zou et al 2020 and other crops there is a lack of research on the organic unity and synchronous utilization of water and fertilizer on sweet pepper furthermore the multi objective optimization of water and nitrogen management based on yield water and nitrogen use efficiency and quality of sweet pepper is rare therefore a consecutive two year experiment was carried out on greenhouse sweet pepper under drip fertigation in the guanzhong plain of china the main objectives were to 1 understand the response of the yield quality water and fertilizer utilization efficiency of sweet pepper to different water and nitrogen regimes 2 clarify the incentive mechanism of wue and nitrogen mobilization and the synergistic effect of water nitrogen application and plant water nitrogen uptake 3 optimize the water and nitrogen management strategy with high quality yield and water nitrogen use efficiency the study aims to provide specific technical supports to optimize water and fertilizer management in facility cultivation and serves as a theoretical basis for the high quality efficient and large scale production of greenhouse sweet pepper in northwest china 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental materials the experiments were

irrigation and fertilization are shown in table 2 american c annuum marco capsicum annuum l var grossum marco f1 was used in this study because it is suitable for greenhouse production the shape of sweet pepper is close to that of long lantern the pepper color starts off green and gradually changes to red as it matures the fertilizers used in the experiment were urea calcium superphosphate and

nitrogen the fruit yield did not reach the maximum but the maximum fruit yield appeared at w2n2 2014 and w1n3 treatments 2015 instead respectively however it should be noted that there was no significant difference in the fruit yield between the two treatments and the same years w3n3 treatment under the same irrigation amount the fruit yield showed a single peak trend with the increase of nitrogen application rates and there was no significant difference between n1 and n4 levels indicating that excessive and low nitrogen application rates reduce fruit yield in the two year experiment

of open air vegetables which is not conducive to human health thereby affecting the quality and nutritional value of sweet pepper therefore the contents of soluble sugar vitamin c and nitrate were used as the quality indexes of sweet pepper in this study the irrigation water amount and nitrogen application rate had significant effects on soluble sugar content of sweet pepper table 4 in the two year experiment under the same irrigation level the soluble sugar content of sweet pepper increased first and then decreased with the increase of nitrogen application rate and achieved a maximum at n3 level followed by n2 level under the same nitrogen application rate the soluble sugar content of sweet pepper decreased with the increase of the level of irrigation while there were no significant difference between w3 and w4 levels except for w3n3 and w4n3 treatments the soluble sugar content reached a maximum at the w4n3 treatment followed by w4n2 and w3n3 treatments under the same nitrogen application rate except under the n4 level in 2014 the vitamin c content of sweet pepper increased first and then decreased with the increase of the level of irrigation water with a maximum at w2 or w3 levels table 4 under the n1 n3 and n4 level condition there was no significant difference in the vitamin content between w2 and w3 levels in 2014 with the increase of the level of irrigation the vitamin content of sweet pepper increased at n4 level and there was no significant difference between w1n4 w2n4 and w3n4 treatment in the two year experiment under the same of irrigation level the vitamin content of sweet pepper increased first and then decreased with the increase of the nitrogen application rate and the vitamin content of each treatment reached the maximum at n3 level in 2014 the vitamin contents of all treatments at n3 level were 10 22 26 45 28 40 52 85 11 44 59 65 and 14 02 61 48 higher than those of n1 n2 and n4 levels respectively in 2015 the vitamin contents of all treatments at n3 level was 6 26 28 12 31 53 53 48 6 65 57 95 and 15 57 61 41 higher than that of n1 n2 and n4 levels respectively the effects of irrigation and fertilization on nitrate content of sweet pepper in greenhouse were significant table 4 with the increasing irrigation level the nitrate content of sweet pepper increased under the same nitrogen application rate in the two year experiment except the w2 level in 2014 there was no significant difference between n4 and n3 treatment at each irrigation level however except the w2 level in 2014 the nitrate content of n4 level was significantly lower than that of n2 level at each irrigation level under the same nitrogen application rate the nitrate content of sweet pepper decreased with the increase of the irrigation level water except n4 level at n3 and n4 levels there was no significant difference in nitrate content between w1 and w3 levels in the two year experiment the nitrate content of sweet pepper reached the minimum of 0 21 mg kg 2014 and 0 24 mg kg 2015 at the w2n4 level respectively and there was no significant difference in the nitrate content between the two treatments and w3n3 treatment in the same year 3 5 coupling effect of water and fertilizer on sweet pepper yield wue pfpn and quality to pursue high yield efficiency quality and sustainable production of sweet pepper in solar greenhouses this study used yield wue nitrogen partial factor productivity pfpn and quality as evaluation indexes to comprehensively evaluate the coupling effect of water and nitrogen on sweet pepper water and nitrogen amounts were independent variables yield wue pfpn vitamin c and soluble sugar content were response variables based on the least square method mathematica 9 0 software was used to analyze the test data and binary quadratic regression equations were established to calculate the amounts of water and nitrogen needed to maximize the above parameters table 5 then the optimal systems of single indexes were solved and the amounts of water and nitrogen corresponding to the optimal solution of each index in the confidence interval were obtained the results showed that the influence of water and nitrogen input on the dependent variables reached a very significant level p 0 01 table 5 the amounts of irrigation and nitrogen application corresponding to the maximum value of each index were shown in table 5 as showed in table 5 it was difficult to obtain the maximum yield wue pfpn vitamin c and soluble sugar content simultaneously in 2014 the maximum sweet pepper yield of 34 9 t ha was obtained when 230 5 mm of irrigation water and 185 6 kg ha of nitrogen were applied while the largest wue of 17 0 kg m3 was obtained when 213 1 mm of irrigation water and 187 0 kg ha of nitrogen were applied the pfpn was maximized at 333 0 kg kg with the application of 248 0 mm of irrigation water and 75 kg ha of nitrogen while the maximum content of vitamin c was obtained when 221 3 mm of irrigation water and 189 0 kg ha of nitrogen were applied and the maximum soluble sugar content of 41 5 was obtained when 167 8 mm of irrigation water and 183 9 kg ha of nitrogen were applied table 5 in 2015 the maximum sweet pepper yield of 34 4 t ha could be obtained when 216 2 mm of irrigation water and 193 5 kg ha of nitrogen were applied while the largest wue of 17 3 kg m3 was obtained when 190 1 mm of irrigation water and 192 6 kg ha of nitrogen were applied the pfpn was maximized at 319 5 kg kg with the application of 222 0 mm of irrigation water and 75 kg ha of nitrogen whilst the maximum content of vitamin c of 192 9 mg 100 g was obtained when 207 2 mm of irrigation water and 189 5 kg ha of nitrogen were applied and the maximum soluble sugar content of 42 1 was obtained when 158 3 mm of irrigation water and 191 3 kg ha of nitrogen were applied table 5 because the yield wue pfpn vitamin c and soluble sugar content cannot be maximized simultaneously for 2014 and 2015 some decisions have to be made in the actual planting of sweet pepper therefore it is necessary to further analyze and investigate the water and nitrogen input combination to obtain the best indicators the coupling effects of water and nitrogen inputs on the sweet pepper yield wue and vitamin c content of sweet pepper in the two year experiment exhibited a downward convex shape and the coupling effect of pfpn exhibited a decreasing tendency the coupling effect of soluble sugar content was a downward convex shape with downward opening and increasing with the decrease of irrigation amount figs 4 and 5 considering some indicators had the similar fertilization range some indicator had small interaction range we did not consider pfpn and soluble sugar content in the comprehensive evaluation the acceptable regions of 95 90 85 80 and 75 of yield wue and vitamin c content were analyzed we found that 95 and 90 acceptable ranges of yield deviated too far from 95 and 90 acceptable ranges of wue and vitamin c content it was impossible to find their overlapping ranges the yield wue and vitamin c content in the 80 and 75 acceptable regions could be found in some overlapping ranges while the indicators deviated too much from their extreme values we also found that the overlapping ranges could be achieved at the acceptable range of 85 simultaneously and the ranges of the three indicators were similar therefore the ranges of greater than or equal to the 85 were considered a reasonable acceptable range figs 4 and 5 based on the analysis of mathematic 9 0 the optimal solutions were found in the best confidence intervals of 85 the yield wue and vitamin c content could achieve the ranges of greater than or equal to the 85 reasonable acceptable range simultaneously at the irrigation water and nitrogen amount of 195 9 212 9 mm is the 78 2 85 0 of etc and 190 5 209 8 kg ha in 2014 while 160 7 185 1 mm 71 3 80 8 etc and 164 5 189 5 kg ha in 2015 respectively considering comprehensively all factors such as meteorological condition of the two different hydrological years 2014 and 2015 under the treatments of this study the sweet pepper yield wue and vitamin c content could achieve the optimal value of 85 simultaneously at the irrigation water and nitrogen application ranges of 78 2 80 8 etc and 164 5 189 5 kg ha respectively table 6 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation amount and nitrogen rate on yield above ground dry matter and hi soil moisture is the basis of soil nutrient release and fertilization can improve water use efficiency of crops nakamura et al 2005 suitable water and fertilizer supply has a significant positive coupling effect on crop yield leading to increased total above ground dry matter and hi yang et al 2014 du et al 2017 kabir et al 2021 irrigation amount has a great impact on crop growth and yield wang et al 2019a 2019b si et al 2020 in this study the yield of sweet pepper increased first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation amount and both the highest w1 and lowest w4 irrigation amounts inhibited sweet pepper yield which was similar the finding of previous studies on broccoli erdem et al 2010 and tomato li et al 2020 appropriate water deficit can promote crop yield however severe water stress cannot meet crop growth need resulting in lower crop yield zhang et al 2018 excessive soil moisture will increase the stem and leaf of crops increases nutritional competition between vegetative organs and fruits and may reduce crop yields lodhi et al 2014 du et al 2017 under the same irrigation amount the crop yield under high nitrogen level n1 and low nitrogen level n4 was close both of which were lower than under n2 and n3 treatments table 3 this finding indicates that nitrogen rates excess or shortage cannot enhance crop yield excessive nitrogen application can promote excessive vegetative growth of plants thereby delaying crop maturity and increasing susceptibility to various diseases and reducing crop yield and productivity hocking et al 1987 du et al 2021 massignam et al 2009 and zou et al 2020 found that nitrogen deficiency results in premature senescence lowers photosynthetic intensity and thus reduces crop yields therefore reasonable water and fertilizer inputs are crucial to improve crop yield our results showed that w2 and w3 irrigation levels and n2 and n3 nitrogen levels were favorable to the accumulation of the total above ground dry matter of sweet pepper which was similar to previous studies sezen et al 2006 gadissa and chemeda 2009 yang et al 2014 showed that increasing irrigation within a certain range was conducive to the accumulation of dry matter in crop above ground consistent with our findings increasing irrigation can alleviate the adverse effects of drought on crop growth to some extent prolong the green holding time of leaves and thus increase the quality of above ground dry matter ierna et al 2011 under suitable water conditions increasing nitrogen level could increase crop growth rate while nitrogen consumption could not produce corresponding relative growth rate and net absorption rate mojaddam et al 2011 in addition previous studies have obtained that vegetables grow best under medium water and nutrient conditions such as watermelon shao et al 2010 xing et al 2015 wang et al 2019a 2019b the change of hi is based on the change of crop yield and dry matter quality under different water and nitrogen conditions hi reflects the ability of photosynthetic product in crop population to transform into economic products xie et al 2011 some studies have shown that severe water stress reduces plant biomass accumulation leading to severe early senescence and decrease in yield and hi yang et al 2000 farooq et al 2014 ünlü et al 2011 and wang et al 2018 revealed that the greatest harvest index was observed under a suitable deficit irrigation amount which was similar to our results under the same irrigation conditions the sweet pepper hi first increased and then decreased with increasing fertilizer rate similar trend was found under the same nitrogen application in the two year experiment hi reached a maximum of 0 66 in the w3n3 treatment in 2014 and 0 69 in the w2n3 treatment in 2015 respectively our study shows that hi is higher under the combination of medium water and medium fertilizer which is consistent with previous studies yan et al 2021 wang et al 2019a 2019b we also found that medium water and fertilizer was a suitable water and fertilizer strategy for sweet pepper in greenhouse 4 2 effects of irrigation amount and nitrogen rate on wue pfpn and fruit quality water and nutrient supplies directly affect plant growth determine the ability of plants to absorb nutrients affect the change and distribution of nutrient content in plants and ultimately influence fruit quality du et al 2017 hong et al 2021 fertilization can improve crop water status and crop water use efficiency but excessive or unpleasant fertilization can reduce crop wue lodhi et al 2014 coupling of water and fertilizer affects crop growth and wue b li et al 2021 h li et al 2021 suitable deficit irrigation can enhance crop yield and wue sezen et al 2006 ozbahce and tari 2010 lodhi et al 2014 wang et al 2019a 2019b found that increasing nitrogen application rates within a certain range improved crop wue which was consistent with our study this may be due to fertilization promoted root growth and canopy development and crops absorbed more soil moisture significantly improved water use efficiency under the condition of constant or little increase intotal water supply li et al 2018 xing et al 2015 kumari et al 2014 indicated that drip fertigation could improve wue of sweet pepper by 94 79 compared with traditional furrow irrigation fertilizer partial productivity is a comprehensive indicator reflecting the local fertilizer application rate and soil basic nutrient level hebbar et al 2004 wu et al 2014 in the two year experiment nitrogen application rate had significant effect on nitrogen use efficiency the average pfpn under high nitrogen level was 75 11 kg kg while the average pfpn under low nitrogen level was 295 89 kg kg similar results was obtained in many field crops xing et al 2015 b li et al 2021 h li et al 2021 and greenhouse crops farneselli et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2019a 2019b despite nitrogen application nitrogen cannot be completely absorbed by crops and thus the nitrogen conversion rate is not 100 yang et al 2007 declared that optimizing water and nitrogen supply can significantly improve nitrogen use efficiency and partial nitrogen productivity under the condition of ensuring yield in this study pfpn was similarly affected by water and fertilizer we found that the effect of fertilization on pfpn was greater than irrigation confirming results of previous studies zhang et al 2018 wu et al 2014 with the improvement of living standards agricultural production not only pursues product output but also demands higher quality the impacts of water and fertilizer on fruit and vegetable quality under drip irrigation have been reported by a number of studies ertek and kara 2013 akhtar et al 2014 wang et al 2019a 2019b previous studies have shown that suitable water and nitrogen supply could not only promote crop growth and fruit development but also improve crop quality without significant decrease in yield du et al 2017 kabir et al 2021 yasuor et al 2013 found that under drip irrigation condition it would not reduce the quality of sweet pepper or produce excess nitrogen to pollute the environment at the nitrogen concentration of 56 2 mg l akhtar et al 2014 showed that reduced irrigation significantly enhanced tomato soluble solids organic acids and vc content despite slight yield reductions compared to full irrigation our results showed that optimizing irrigation and nitrogen management could reduce water and nitrogen input control nitrate content within a certain range and maximize soluble sugar and vc content similar to sezen et al 2006 and xing et al 2015 this study found that it could have a good coupling effect on water and nitrogen in the w3n3 treatment but limited the absorption of fruit nutrition in the w4n4 treatment 4 3 the optimal combination of irrigation amount and nitrogen rate intervals thompson et al 2000 used multiple regression analysis method to comprehensively evaluate the agronomic economic and environmental benefits of drip irrigation and fertilization of cauliflower they obtained that the water and nitrogen ranges corresponding to the near overlapping areas of each index acceptable region the maximum value of 95 were 100 120 mm and 300 400 kg ha respectively xing et al 2015 studied the effects of water and fertilizer combination on root growth yield water and fertilizer use efficiency and quality of greenhouse tomato under drip irrigation fertilization by using multiple regression analysis and spatial analysis wang et al 2019a 2019b considered that the confidence interval of the maximum 90 of cucumber yield wue quality pfpn and other indicators in greenhouse and the optimal drip irrigation interval of 124 151 mm and the nitrogen application interval of 318 504 kg ha it followed that the use of multivariate regression can accurately quantify the optimal value of the target and determine the acceptable areas that meet different requirements rather than compare the change trend and simple size wang et al 2018 zou et al 2020 yan et al 2021 in this study we further analyzed the relationships between sweet pepper yield wue and quality by considering the 85 confidence interval for the maximum values of those parameters based on the analysis of mathematic 9 0 we found that the optimal values of sweet pepper yield wue and quality could be achieved simultaneously at the acceptable range of 85 with irrigation water and nitrogen ranges of 78 2 80 8 etc and 164 5 189 5 kg ha fig 4 these ranges of irrigation water and nitrogen were recommended as the optimal irrigation and fertilization strategy for sustainable sweet pepper production in the study region 5 conclusions at the same fertilization application rate the indexes such as the total of above ground dry matter yield hi and wue iwue of sweet pepper first increased and then decreased with the increase of irrigation amount with maximums at the irrigation levels of 75 etc or 90 etc under the same irrigation amount condition the indexes such as wue and hi increased first and then decreased with the increase of nitrogen application rate reaching the maximum at the fertilization amount of 225 kg ha despite downward trends of the nitrogen related indexes e g npfp the low irrigation level of 60 etc did not enhance fertilizer efficiency while the irrigation level of 75 etc or 90 etc could significantly improve the yield and quality due to the lack of water resources in northwest china 75 etc irrigation and 225 kg ha fertilization are the best fertilization strategies for drip irrigation based on the principle of least square method and mathematica 9 0 analysis each index above cannot reach the maximum at the same time the yield wue and fruit quality of sweet pepper could be achieved the optimal value in the optimal 85 confidence interval with the irrigation level of 78 2 80 8 etc and the nitrogen amount of 164 5 189 5 kg ha applied together our results are of great significance for the scientific management of facility agriculture water and fertilization of sweet pepper

9767,irrigation methods can affect nitrogen loss in agricultural soil exploring the effects of different irrigation methods on soil nitrogen losses in arid areas can provide a basis for more effective water and fertilizer management a 2 year field experiment was performed using a static chamber and soil solution extractor to quantify nitrous oxide n2o emissions and nitrogen leaching from upland soils during various potato plant growth stages the treatments included drip fertigation without fertilizer drip fertigation 500 kg n hm2 drip fertigation 1000 kg n hm2 furrow irrigation without fertilizer furrow irrigation 500 kg n hm2 and furrow irrigation 1000 kg n hm2 n2o emissions and nitrogen leaching were significantly different at the different potato growth stages p 0 01 under both irrigation methods the peak n2o emissions appeared during the tuber setting and swelling stages and the total emission ratios of the two stages under each treatment in these two periods were 56 89 in 2018 and 2019 nitrogen dioxide no2 plays a crucial role in n2o emissions a significant peak in n2o emissions was found to be related to the existence of no2 the correlation coefficient between no2 concentration and n2o emissions reached 0 6413 p 0 05 leaching losses also peaked during the tuber setting and swelling stages with ratios of 51 14 84 22 compared with furrow irrigation the n2o emissions from drip irrigation were decreased by 34 10 81 36 nitrogen leaching decreased by 35 26 68 35 and the n2o emission intensity decreased by 40 0 86 9 drip irrigation can effectively decrease nitrogen losses and is an effective strategy to save water to mitigate the emission of atmospheric pollutants such as n2o and reduce nitrogen leaching graphical abstract ga1 keywords irrigation method nitrogen dioxide nitrate ammonium n2o emission 1 introduction n2o is an important greenhouse gas among greenhouse gases n2o is the third highest contributor to global warming after ch4 and co2 yang et al 2019 the loss of nitrogen through n2o emissions has attracted considerable attention owing to its tremendous global warming potential which is approximately 265 fold that of co2 yang et al 2018b n2o also plays an important role in the depletion of stratospheric ozone as it passes through the stratosphere it generates nox through a photochemical reaction nox destroys the ozone layer and increases the ultraviolet radiation reaching the surface of the earth threatening the human living environment ravishankara et al 2009 n2o emissions are an important nitrogen loss pathway in agronomy systems ipcc 2014 and agricultural soil is considered an important source of atmospheric n2o tian et al 2017 to obtain better crop yields farmers in china generally use large amounts of fertilizer and water which leads to the extensive loss of water resources and nitrogen fertilizer nitrogen leaching is another important nitrogen loss pathway in agronomy systems local farmers in china usually adopt furrow irrigation and high fertilizer usage based farmland management strategies high fertilizer usage leads to a large amount of residual nitrogen in the soil furrow irrigation causes this residual nitrogen to leach into deeper soil layers or into the groundwater yang et al 2020 subsequently contaminating the groundwater and affecting drinking water safety yang et al 2019 some studies have shown that nitrification and denitrification account for 54 and 30 of cumulative n2o emissions respectively the substrates of both nitrification and denitrification nh4 and no3 can be supplied in nitrogen fertilizer resulting in high n2o emissions gu et al 2013 irrigation can affect n2o emissions and nitrogen leaching most irrigation methods also affect the physicochemical and structural properties of the soil resulting in changes in soil permeability and soil microbial activity yang et al 2020 2019 thus both nitrification and denitrification which affect n2o emissions and the amount of nitrogen leaching are influenced by irrigation li et al 2020 however the effects of irrigation methods on n2o emissions differ from their effects on nitrogen leaching some studies have shown that compared with conventional furrow irrigation the cumulative n2o emission of drip irrigation can be reduced by 30 40 kennedy et al 2013 but other studies have concluded that the high frequency irrigation in drip fertigation results in denitrification thus increasing n2o emissions zhang et al 2016 however only a few studies have simultaneously observed n2o emissions and nitrogen leaching under different irrigation methods therefore in this study n2o emissions and nitrogen leaching were monitored simultaneously under two irrigation methods drip irrigation and furrow irrigation to determine their characteristics studies on factors that influence n2o emissions commonly focus on no3 and nh4 li et al 2015 while less attention has been paid to the role of no2 in n2o emissions no2 is an important intermediate product of nitrification and denitrification although the no2 concentration is lower than the no3 and nh4 concentrations its contribution to n2o production cannot be ignored therefore it is necessary to gain an understanding of the mechanisms underlying the contribution of no2 to n2o emissions through systematic studies in this study a 2 year experiment was conducted to investigate the characteristics of n2o emissions and nitrogen leaching in a potato field at different depths and growth stages under drip and furrow irrigation treatments in addition the influence of no2 on n2o emissions was explored the objectives of this experiment were as follows 1 to measure n2o emissions during different potato growth stages under drip and furrow irrigation 2 to determine the amount of nitrogen leaching in a potato field in different soil layers 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm as well as the effects of the two irrigation methods on these values and 3 to identify the key role of no2 in n2o emissions the findings from this study will inform strategies for reducing the loss of nitrogen fertilizer by decreasing n2o emissions and nitrogen leaching 2 materials and methods 2 1 field

nutritionally poor according to the standard nitrogen requirements of potato crops producing 4 5 104 kg hm2 500 kg n hm2 needed to be added to the measured soil nitrogen content this is the standard nitrogen application rate under drip fertigation the application of 1000 kg n hm2 is a conventional local fertilization method under furrow irrigation the nitrogen fate of the treatments with different irrigation methods and fertilization rates could be easily compared all treatments were replicated three times with the experimental plots arranged in a complete randomized block design eight rows of potatoes were planted in each plot with ridge spacing height and row lengths of 90 cm 30 cm and 11 2 m respectively 2 1 2 1 irrigation management each drip irrigation treatment had a separate irrigation system each system comprised a screen filter a fertilizer tank and eight drip tapes with one valve one water flow meter and one pressure gauge to control the operating pressure and measure irrigation quantity thin wall drip tapes drip tapes lvyuan co beijing china with 20 cm dripper spacing a flow rate of 1 38 l m h and an operating pressure of 0 1 mpa were placed in the center of each of the raised beds irrigation began on 15 may 2018 and 19 may 2019 immediately after the potatoes were planted the initial water application intensity was 20 mm 4 h 48 min for drip irrigation and about 120 mm for furrow irrigation after potato emergence the soil matric potential smp an indicator of soil water content measured using a tensiometer in the 20 cm soil layer under the emitters can be used to schedule drip irrigation wan et al 2013 in terms of potato growth irrigation water use efficiency results suggest that an smp of 25 kpa is favorable for potato production wang et al 2007 irrigation was initiated when the mean smp approached a threshold value of 25 kpa the irrigation duration was determined by the wetting of the main potato root zones and usually took about 1 h 12 min providing around 5 mm of water each time drip fertigation was stopped 20 d before harvesting the average total amount of water supplied across a unit area of the field subjected to the drip irrigation treatments was 193 3 mm in the 2018 growing season and 197 9 mm in the 2019 growing season the timing and amount of furrow irrigation was decided based on local irrigation practices after the potatoes sprouted furrow irrigation was uniformly applied twice the first application during the tuber setting stage and the second during the tuber swelling stage the average total amount of irrigation under the furrow irrigation treatments over the whole crop growing season was 356 8 mm in 2018 and 366 6 mm in 2019 2 1 2 2 fertilization management n p and k compound fertilizer for potatoes was applied as the base fertilizer urea and potassium nitrate were applied as a topdressing fertilizer from potato emergence to 20 d before potato harvest in the drip irrigation as well as the furrow irrigation treatments drip irrigation was used for drip fertigation during topdressing urea and potassium nitrate were applied in split doses once a day under the drip irrigation system urea was applied for 25 d as a topdressing fertilizer from the emergence of potatoes potassium nitrate was applied for 70 d from potato emergence to 20 d before potato harvest if for example no water was required for three consecutive days owing to rainy weather the fertilizer for the first 3 d was applied together with the fertilizer for the fourth day when irrigation commenced fertilizer was applied through conventional fertilization in the furrow irrigation treatments all the fertilizer for the entire potato growth period was applied twice the base fertilizer was applied once during planting and the topdressing was applied once during the tuber swelling stage a potato crop solanum tuberosum l cv favorita requiring about 105 d to reach maturity was planted by a potato seeder on 15 may 2018 and 19 may 2019 the potatoes were harvested in september in both 2018 and 2019 the preceding crop in 2018 and the succeeding crop in 2019 were both corn crops 2 1 3 chemical analyses 2 1 3 1 n2o emissions n2o emission fluxes were observed by the static chamber chromatography method the sampling box was composed of top and base boxes the length and width of the top box were both 50 cm and plastic foam was used to wrap the outside of the box which is convenient for mixing gases a small fan was installed inside the top box to ensure uniform gas distribution the whole box was covered with sealing strips to ensure appropriate sealing the top box was equipped with a temperature sensor gas sample connector and fan connector the base box was buried in the ground after the crop was sown the top box was used along with the base and was placed on the ridge before the crop was planted and its position remained unchanged throughout the experiment to ensure that soil n2o emission was as uniform as possible the sampling boxes in each plot were placed at the center of the plot to cover a potato seedling and the water pressure of each plot was kept consistent during irrigation before sampling sufficient water was injected into the base to test the sealing between the top and base boxes during sampling the top box was placed on the base following which 80 ml gas samples were extracted from the box with a 100 ml syringe with a three way head at 0 5 10 15 and 20 min and transported to the laboratory for n2o concentration analysis samples were collected once a week after potato sowing and the collection time was usually between 08 00 and 11 00 the sample in the syringe was determined using an agilent 6890 gas chromatograph agilent 6820d agilent corporation california

originpro 2018 and excel 2010 software 3 results 3 1 characteristics of n2o emissions during potato growing seasons cumulative n2o emissions showed significant seasonal variations under drip and furrow irrigation in 2018 and 2019 n2o emissions during the tuber setting and swelling stages were higher than those during other growth stages under both irrigation methods and in both years fig 3a

of nitrate ranging from 0 95 to 3 38 kg n hm2 figs 4a and 5a the same results were obtained using the furrow irrigation method nitrate leaching losses ranged from 13 24 to 46 28 kg n hm2 which were far higher than those of ammonia which ranged from 1 69 to 6 60 kg n hm2 figs 4a and 5a compared with furrow irrigation drip irrigation significantly reduced the amount of no3 n and nh4 n leached by 35 26 and 68 35 at soil depths of 0 40 cm respectively and by 48 79 and 43 79 at soil depths of 40 80 cm respectively the amount of nitrate leached from the 40 80 cm layer was lower than that from the

emissions an incubation experiment was conducted to determine the concentration of no2 and verify its effect on n2o emissions the results show that n2o emissions increased as the amount of irrigation and applied nitrogen increased n2o emissions under nitrogen fertilizer treatment were higher than those under the control treatment additionally these emissions were higher after treatment with high irrigation volumes than after treatment with low irrigation volumes during the entire experimental period the peak value of n2o emission flux appeared within the first 7 d the peak values of the n2o emission fluxes in n1 n2 l1 h1 l2 and h2 treatments were 78 05 89 05 919 76 1976 08 598 71 and 1255 50 µg m2 h respectively fig 6 the two control treatments showed no significant differences while the peak values under the l1 and h1 treatments were approximately 2 fold higher than those under the l2 and h2 treatments fig 7 previous studies have usually ignored the concentration of no2 n often not measuring it at all in the soil solution however in the present study we determined the existence of no2 n in the soil solution no2 n concentrations were the highest during the first 7 d of treatment and gradually decreased with time the peak no2 n value over all treatments with nitrogen fertilizer was approximately 6 mg l however the control treatment showed no significant differences p 0 01 throughout the experiment fig 8 the peak no2 n value appeared during the first 7 d of the experiment and it maintained consistency with the peak value of n2o emissions the relationship between no2 and n2o emissions showed a significant positive correlation as the correlation coefficient reached 0 6413 p 0 05 fig 8 in this study the no3 n concentration exhibited similar trends in the l1 h1 l2 and h2 treatments the no3 n concentrations under the l1 h1 l2 and h2 treatments were the highest during the first 7 d and gradually decreased with time fig 9a the concentrations under the four aforementioned treatments ranged from 2 30 to 21 13 12 98 31 94 2 34 20 28 and 12 97 31 34 mg l respectively no significant differences were observed between the n1 and n2 treatments throughout the experiment but the no3 n concentrations in the l1 and l2 treatments were lower than those in h1 and h2 treatments p 0 01 the no3 n concentration under the h1 treatment remained higher than that under the l1 treatment however there was no significant difference in nitrate concentration under different irrigation levels with the same nitrogen application rate p 0 05 the change in the nh4 n concentration differed from those in the no3 n concentration the nh4 n concentration gradually decreased with time and the concentration under all treatments reached approximately 0 mg l by the end of the experiment fig 9b the highest nh4 n concentrations under the l1 h1 l2 and h2 treatments were 7 73 11 19 7 33 and 11 28 mg l respectively the nh4 n concentration under the h1 treatment remained higher than that under the l1 treatment however there was no significant difference in ammonia concentrations under different irrigation levels with the same nitrogen application rate p 0 05 throughout the experiment the concentration of inorganic compounds was measured and the concentration of no3 n was higher than that of nh4 n the highest concentration of no3 n was approximately 3 fold that of nh4 n 3 4 n2o emission intensities under drip and furrow irrigation the n2o emission intensities based on cumulative n2o emissions and potato yields are shown in fig 10 the figure shows that the n2o emission intensities of drip irrigation was significantly lower than that of furrow irrigation in both years p 0 01 and the intensity was lower in 2019 than in 2018 under the same irrigation modes the n2o emission intensities value increased with the increase of the nitrogen application rate in 2018 the values under the dn dl dh fn fl and fh treatments were 0 05 0 08 0 19 0 09 0 61 and 1 17 kg n t respectively in 2019 the values were 0 06 0 07 0 17 0 10 0 18 and 0 39 kg n t respectively there were significant differences in n2o emission intensities among the treatments p 0 05 compared with the furrow irrigation fn fl and fh treatments the n2o emission intensities in the drip irrigation dn dl and dh treatments decreased by 44 4 86 9 and 83 8 in 2018 and by 40 0 61 1 and 56 4 in 2019 respectively table 3 4 discussion 4 1 drip fertigation can effectively reduce n2o emissions during potato growth stages drip irrigation is one of the water saving irrigation methods that is widely adopted in agricultural production under drip irrigation since the water supply is lower soil porosity is higher and soil is looser than that in furrow irrigated fields sun et al 2008 lv et al 2010 the process of soil n2o production from denitrification will be limited all of which are conducive to the inhibition of n2o emissions kallenbach et al 2010 sánchez martín et al 2010 the environmental conditions of soils in drip irrigation favor nitrification which contribute to lower emissions of n2o ding et al 2019 sánchez martín et al 2008 previous studies have shown that compared with furrow irrigation drip fertigation can effectively reduce n2o emissions the same result was also obtained in the present study drip irrigation is widely used in china to reduce these emissions the difference in the n2o emission fluxes was affected by the change in irrigation methods however the amount of water applied in conventional furrow irrigation was greater than the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil with furrows remaining flooded for a long time in furrow irrigation the high rate of water application led to the rapid dissolution of the fertilizers and produced large amounts of nh4 n in the soil the nh4 n in the wetting soil was rapidly nitrified which increased the concentration of no3 n high concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n accelerate higher n2o emissions during nitrification and denitrification reactions yang et al 2019 the rapid dissolution of a large amount of fertilizer would partly explain the significantly larger no3 n and nh4 n concentrations that were found in furrow irrigated soil compared to drip irrigated soil figs 4 and 5 the use of furrow irrigation has been shown to lead to higher n2o emissions than drip irrigation sánchez martín et al 2008 the addition of nitrogen fertilizer generally increases n2o emissions signor et al 2013 huang et al 2014 in our study soil in furrow irrigated potato fields emits more n2o than that in drip irrigated potato fields the current study revealed that the cumulative n2o emissions in 2019 were lower than that in 2018 the inter annual difference indicated a possible link between n2o emissions and precipitation in the rainy season under the condition that drip and furrow irrigation measures are consistent in 2018 and 2019 in this study the highest cumulative n2o emissions were mainly observed during the tuber setting and swelling stages of potato growth which occur in july and august respectively the climate of inner mongolia is classified as an arid semi arid region and the annual precipitation is mainly concentrated in july and august the precipitation in 2018 is more than that in 2019 fig 1 after more precipitation the soil surface is moist for a long time and the soil moisture content increases significantly which enhances microbial activity that is conducive to the denitrification process thereby increasing n2o emissions saggar et al 2008 such an effect on n2o emissions was attributed to a stimulated microbial activity from the higher temperature and moisture of soil in july and august resulting in the denitrification the process of denitrification microorganism participated had a significant effect on n2o emissions zhang and han 2008 our study shows a high positive correlation between precipitation and n2o emissions over two years fig 11 similar to our observations a previous study found that the highest n2o emissions occurred during the more rainy season in california s central valley in soils from other arid and semi arid regions kallenbach et al 2010 4 2 drip fertigation can effectively reduce nitrogen leaching losses during potato growth in our study the cumulative no3 n and nh4 n in the soil layer of 40 cm under drip irrigation was less than that under furrow irrigation throughout the potato growing season the highest no3 n content was mainly concentrated in the root zone of the potato to ensure that the potato can effectively absorb nutrition under drip irrigation yang et al 2020 found that water saving irrigation can effectively reduce the amount of leached nitrogen leakage of no3 n under the drip irrigation system was less than that in the furrow irrigation system li et al 2016 this may be owing to the low intensity of drip irrigation weakening the ability of the water to move downwards through the soil nitrogen leaching is an important pathway through which the nitrogen fertilizer applied to the soil for crop growth is lost under furrow irrigation nitrogen in chemical fertilizers mainly exists in a soluble inorganic form that can dissolve rapidly in water after being applied to the soil thereby allowing it to be easily leached by soil water movement under furrow irrigation gilliam et al 2016 in addition with an increase in soil water content in furrow irrigation the adsorption capacity of soil particles to nitrogen decreases which further promotes nitrogen leaching yang et al 2019 the results of the present study confirm this hypothesis and we concluded that the amount of nitrogen leached under drip irrigation is significantly lower than that under furrow irrigation 4 3 relationship between n2o emissions and nitrogen leaching some studies barton et al 2007 ma et al 2010 have shown a positive correlation between n2o emissions and the amount of nitrogen leached while other studies zhou et al 2013 have shown a negative correlation a strong relationship between n2o fluxes and nitrogen leaching losses was found in various potato growth stages in our study fig 12 the results of our study are consistent with those of barton et al 2007 and ma et al 2010 these findings support our hypothesis that in the investigated cropland nitrogen leaching promoted the formation of n2o via denitrification under furrow irrigation n2o emissions tend to be high when nitrogen leaching is high under furrow irrigation potato is a typical crop of shallow root the soil in our study area was chestnut soil with a sandy clay loam texture which has poor ability to intercept water and fertilizer from the point of view of environmental friendliness and reduction of environmental risk the comprehensive technology of water and nutrient management under drip irrigation in potato production has more important practical significance in arid and semi arid areas 4 4 influence of no2 on n2o emissions our results show that the peak no2 concentration was highly consistent with n2o emissions which were mainly concentrated in the first 7 d of the experiment therefore we speculate that the existence of nitrite nitrogen plays an essential role in promoting n2o emissions combining the results of the field experiment laboratory experiment and the conceptual understanding of the mechanisms underlying microbial nitrification and denitrification the mechanism underlying n2o emissions from the soil solution is shown in fig 13 no2 can possibly promote n2o emissions because the existence of no2 in the soil solution inhibits the activity of n2o reductase and promotes n2o emissions this hypothesis can be tested in future studies by performing incubation experiments and measuring the abundance of functional genes associated with nitrogen cycling 5 conclusions changes in n2o emissions and the amount of nitrogen leached at depths of 40 and 80 cm in the soil solution during different potato growth stages were evaluated in drip and furrow irrigated potato fields for 2 years cumulative n2o emissions and nitrogen leaching losses under drip irrigation were less than that under furrow irrigation during various growth stages in potato fields moreover our study showed that the concentration of no2 is positively correlated with n2o emissions and the key role of no2 in n2o emissions was explored compared with conventional irrigation furrow irrigation water saving irrigation drip irrigation can effectively reduce losses owing to n2o emissions and nitrogen leaching it can also improve fertilizer utilization rates increase potato yields and reduce environmental pollution further research is required to explore the microbial mechanisms underlying n2o emissions from no2 using both field and laboratory experiments funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china china grant numbers 42175038 41765010 the program

9767,irrigation methods can affect nitrogen loss in agricultural soil exploring the effects of different irrigation methods on soil nitrogen losses in arid areas can provide a basis for more effective water and fertilizer management a 2 year field experiment was performed using a static chamber and soil solution extractor to quantify nitrous oxide n2o emissions and nitrogen leaching from upland soils during various potato plant growth stages the treatments included drip fertigation without fertilizer drip fertigation 500 kg n hm2 drip fertigation 1000 kg n hm2 furrow irrigation without fertilizer furrow irrigation 500 kg n hm2 and furrow irrigation 1000 kg n hm2 n2o emissions and nitrogen leaching were significantly different at the different potato growth stages p 0 01 under both irrigation methods the peak n2o emissions appeared during the tuber setting and swelling stages and the total emission ratios of the two stages under each treatment in these two periods were 56 89 in 2018 and 2019 nitrogen dioxide no2 plays a crucial role in n2o emissions a significant peak in n2o emissions was found to be related to the existence of no2 the correlation coefficient between no2 concentration and n2o emissions reached 0 6413 p 0 05 leaching losses also peaked during the tuber setting and swelling stages with ratios of 51 14 84 22 compared with furrow irrigation the n2o emissions from drip irrigation were decreased by 34 10 81 36 nitrogen leaching decreased by 35 26 68 35 and the n2o emission intensity decreased by 40 0 86 9 drip irrigation can effectively decrease nitrogen losses and is an effective strategy to save water to mitigate the emission of atmospheric pollutants such as n2o and reduce nitrogen leaching graphical abstract ga1 keywords irrigation method nitrogen dioxide nitrate ammonium n2o emission 1 introduction n2o is an important greenhouse gas among greenhouse gases n2o is the third highest contributor to global warming after ch4 and co2 yang et al 2019 the loss of nitrogen through n2o emissions has attracted considerable attention owing to its tremendous global warming potential which is approximately 265 fold that of co2 yang et al 2018b n2o also plays an important role in the depletion of stratospheric ozone as it passes through the stratosphere it generates nox through a photochemical reaction nox destroys the ozone layer and increases the ultraviolet radiation reaching the surface of the earth threatening the human living environment ravishankara et al 2009 n2o emissions are an important nitrogen loss pathway in agronomy systems ipcc 2014 and agricultural soil is considered an important source of atmospheric n2o tian et al 2017 to obtain better crop yields farmers in china generally use large amounts of fertilizer and water which leads to the extensive loss of water resources and nitrogen fertilizer nitrogen leaching is another important nitrogen loss pathway in agronomy systems local farmers in china usually adopt furrow irrigation and high fertilizer usage based farmland management strategies high fertilizer usage leads to a large amount of residual nitrogen in the soil furrow irrigation causes this residual nitrogen to leach into deeper soil layers or into the groundwater yang et al 2020 subsequently contaminating the groundwater and affecting drinking water safety yang et al 2019 some studies have shown that nitrification and denitrification account for 54 and 30 of cumulative n2o emissions respectively the substrates of both nitrification and denitrification nh4 and no3 can be supplied in nitrogen fertilizer resulting in high n2o emissions gu et al 2013 irrigation can affect n2o emissions and nitrogen leaching most irrigation methods also affect the physicochemical and structural properties of the soil resulting in changes in soil permeability and soil microbial activity yang et al 2020 2019 thus both nitrification and denitrification which affect n2o emissions and the amount of nitrogen leaching are influenced by irrigation li et al 2020 however the effects of irrigation methods on n2o emissions differ from their effects on nitrogen leaching some studies have shown that compared with conventional furrow irrigation the cumulative n2o emission of drip irrigation can be reduced by 30 40 kennedy et al 2013 but other studies have concluded that the high frequency irrigation in drip fertigation results in denitrification thus increasing n2o emissions zhang et al 2016 however only a few studies have simultaneously observed n2o emissions and nitrogen leaching under different irrigation methods therefore in this study n2o emissions and nitrogen leaching were monitored simultaneously under two irrigation methods drip irrigation and furrow irrigation to determine their characteristics studies on factors that influence n2o emissions commonly focus on no3 and nh4 li et al 2015 while less attention has been paid to the role of no2 in n2o emissions no2 is an important intermediate product of nitrification and denitrification although the no2 concentration is lower than the no3 and nh4 concentrations its contribution to n2o production cannot be ignored therefore it is necessary to gain an understanding of the mechanisms underlying the contribution of no2 to n2o emissions through systematic studies in this study a 2 year experiment was conducted to investigate the characteristics of n2o emissions and nitrogen leaching in a potato field at different depths and growth stages under drip and furrow irrigation treatments in addition the influence of no2 on n2o emissions was explored the objectives of this experiment were as follows 1 to measure n2o emissions during different potato growth stages under drip and furrow irrigation 2 to determine the amount of nitrogen leaching in a potato field in different soil layers 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm as well as the effects of the two irrigation methods on these values and 3 to identify the key role of no2 in n2o emissions the findings from this study will inform strategies for reducing the loss of nitrogen fertilizer by decreasing n2o emissions and nitrogen leaching 2 materials and methods 2 1 field

min providing around 5 mm of water each time drip fertigation was stopped 20 d before harvesting the average total amount of water supplied across a unit area of the field subjected to the drip irrigation treatments was 193 3 mm in the 2018 growing season and 197 9 mm in the 2019 growing season the timing and amount of furrow irrigation was decided based on local irrigation practices after the potatoes sprouted furrow irrigation was uniformly applied twice the first application during the tuber setting stage and the second during the tuber swelling stage the average total amount of irrigation under the furrow irrigation treatments over the whole crop growing season was 356 8 mm in 2018 and 366 6 mm in 2019 2 1 2 2 fertilization management n p and k compound fertilizer for potatoes was applied as the base fertilizer urea and potassium nitrate were applied as a topdressing fertilizer from potato emergence to 20 d before potato harvest in the drip irrigation as well as the furrow irrigation treatments drip irrigation was used for drip fertigation during topdressing urea and potassium nitrate were applied in split doses once a day under the drip irrigation system urea was applied for 25 d as a topdressing fertilizer from the emergence of potatoes potassium nitrate was applied for 70 d from potato emergence to 20 d before potato harvest if for example no water was required for three consecutive days owing to rainy weather the fertilizer for the first 3 d was applied together with the fertilizer for the fourth day when irrigation commenced fertilizer was applied through conventional fertilization in the furrow irrigation treatments all the fertilizer for the entire potato growth period was applied twice the base fertilizer was applied once during planting and the topdressing was applied once during the tuber swelling stage a potato crop solanum tuberosum l cv favorita requiring about 105 d to reach maturity was planted by a potato seeder on 15 may 2018 and 19 may 2019 the potatoes were harvested in september in both 2018 and 2019 the preceding crop in 2018 and the succeeding crop in 2019 were both corn crops 2 1 3 chemical analyses 2 1 3 1 n2o emissions n2o emission fluxes were observed by the static chamber chromatography method the sampling box was composed of top and base boxes the length and width of the top box were both 50 cm and plastic foam was used to wrap the outside of the box which is convenient for mixing gases a small fan was installed inside the top box to ensure uniform gas distribution the whole box was covered with sealing strips to ensure appropriate sealing the top box was equipped with a temperature sensor gas sample connector and fan connector the base box was buried in the ground after the crop was sown the top box was used along with the base and was placed on the ridge before the crop was planted and its position remained unchanged throughout the experiment to ensure that soil n2o emission was as uniform as possible the sampling boxes in each plot were placed at the center of the plot to cover a potato seedling and the water pressure of each plot was kept consistent during irrigation before sampling sufficient water was injected into the base to test the sealing between the top and base boxes during sampling the top box was placed on the base following which 80 ml gas samples were extracted from the box with a 100 ml syringe with a three way head at 0 5 10 15 and 20 min and transported to the laboratory for n2o concentration analysis samples were collected once a week after

furrow irrigation in 2018 and 2019 n2o emissions during the tuber setting and swelling stages were higher than those during other growth stages under both irrigation methods and in both years fig 3a

39 and 26 respectively the percentages of n2o emissions under the fn fl and fh treatments over the two growing seasons were 39 and 27 52 and 24 and 55 and 24 respectively 3 2 characteristics of nitrogen leaching during potato growing seasons in 2018 under drip fertigation nitrate leaching losses ranged from 4 19 to 29 96 kg n hm2 while ammonia leaching losses were markedly higher than those of nitrate ranging from 0 95 to 3 38 kg n hm2 figs 4a and 5a the same results were obtained using the furrow irrigation method nitrate leaching losses ranged from 13 24 to 46 28 kg n hm2 which were far higher than those of ammonia which ranged from 1 69 to 6 60 kg n hm2 figs 4a and 5a compared with furrow irrigation drip irrigation significantly reduced the amount of no3 n and nh4 n leached by 35 26 and 68 35 at soil depths of 0 40 cm respectively and by 48 79 and 43 79 at soil depths of 40 80 cm respectively the amount of nitrate leached from the 40 80 cm layer was lower than that from the 0 40 cm layer under both irrigation methods similar results were obtained for leached ammonia the highest values of leached nitrate and ammonia were mainly observed during the tuber setting and swelling stages figs 4 and 5 the percentages of leached nitrate and ammonia during these two stages were higher than that during other growth stages for both irrigation methods the percentages of

emissions an incubation experiment was conducted to determine the concentration of no2 and verify its effect on n2o emissions the results show that n2o emissions increased as the amount of irrigation and applied nitrogen increased n2o emissions under nitrogen fertilizer treatment were higher than those under the control treatment additionally these emissions were higher after treatment with high irrigation volumes than after treatment with low irrigation volumes during the entire experimental period the peak value of n2o emission flux appeared within the first 7 d the peak values of the n2o emission fluxes in n1 n2 l1 h1 l2 and h2 treatments were 78 05 89 05 919 76 1976 08 598 71 and 1255 50 µg m2 h respectively fig 6 the two control treatments showed no significant differences while the peak values under the l1 and h1 treatments were approximately 2 fold higher than those under the l2 and h2 treatments fig 7 previous studies have usually ignored the concentration of no2 n often not measuring it at all in the soil solution however in the present study we determined the existence of no2 n in the soil solution no2 n concentrations were the highest during the first 7 d of treatment and gradually decreased with time the peak no2 n value over all treatments with nitrogen fertilizer was approximately 6 mg l however the control treatment showed no significant differences p 0 01 throughout the experiment fig 8 the peak no2 n value appeared during the first 7 d of the experiment and it maintained consistency with the peak value of n2o emissions the relationship between no2 and n2o emissions showed a significant positive correlation as the correlation coefficient reached 0 6413 p 0 05 fig 8 in this study the no3 n concentration exhibited similar trends in the l1 h1 l2 and h2 treatments the no3 n concentrations under the l1 h1 l2 and h2 treatments were the highest during the first 7 d and gradually decreased with time fig 9a the concentrations under the four aforementioned treatments ranged from 2 30 to 21 13 12 98 31 94 2 34 20 28 and 12 97 31 34 mg l respectively no significant differences were observed between the n1 and n2 treatments throughout the experiment but the no3 n concentrations in the l1 and l2 treatments were lower than those in h1 and h2 treatments p 0 01 the no3 n concentration under the h1 treatment remained higher than that under the l1 treatment however there was no significant difference in nitrate concentration under different irrigation levels with the same nitrogen application rate p 0 05 the change in the nh4 n concentration differed from those in the no3 n concentration the nh4 n concentration gradually decreased with time and the concentration under all treatments reached approximately 0 mg l by the end of the experiment fig 9b the highest nh4 n concentrations under the l1 h1 l2 and h2 treatments were 7 73 11 19 7 33 and 11 28 mg l respectively the nh4 n concentration under the h1 treatment remained higher than that under the l1 treatment however there was no significant difference in ammonia concentrations under different irrigation levels with the same nitrogen application rate p 0 05 throughout the experiment the concentration of inorganic compounds was measured and the concentration of no3 n was higher than that of nh4 n the highest concentration of no3 n was approximately 3 fold that of nh4 n 3 4 n2o emission intensities under drip and furrow irrigation the n2o emission intensities based on cumulative n2o emissions and potato yields are shown in fig 10 the figure shows that the n2o emission intensities of drip irrigation was significantly lower than that of furrow irrigation in both years p 0 01 and the intensity was lower in 2019 than in 2018 under the same irrigation modes the n2o emission intensities value increased with the increase of the nitrogen application rate in 2018 the values under the dn dl dh fn fl and fh treatments were 0 05 0 08 0 19 0 09 0 61 and 1 17 kg n t respectively in 2019 the values were 0 06 0 07 0 17 0 10 0 18 and 0 39 kg n t respectively there were significant differences in n2o emission intensities among the treatments p 0 05 compared with the furrow irrigation fn fl and fh treatments the n2o emission intensities in the drip irrigation dn dl and dh treatments decreased by 44 4 86 9 and 83 8 in 2018 and by 40 0 61 1 and 56 4 in 2019 respectively table 3 4 discussion 4 1 drip fertigation can effectively reduce n2o emissions during potato growth stages drip irrigation is one of the water saving irrigation methods that is widely adopted in agricultural production under drip irrigation since the water supply is lower soil porosity is higher and soil is looser than that in furrow irrigated fields sun et al 2008 lv et al 2010 the process of soil n2o production from denitrification will be limited all of which are conducive to the inhibition of n2o emissions kallenbach et al 2010 sánchez martín et al 2010 the environmental conditions of soils in drip irrigation favor nitrification which contribute to lower emissions of n2o ding et al 2019 sánchez martín et al 2008 previous studies have shown that compared with furrow irrigation drip fertigation can effectively reduce n2o emissions the same result was also obtained in the present study drip irrigation is widely used in china to reduce these emissions the difference in the n2o emission fluxes was affected by the change in irrigation methods however the amount of water applied in conventional furrow irrigation was greater than the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil with furrows remaining flooded for a long time in furrow irrigation the high rate of water application led to the rapid dissolution of the fertilizers and produced large amounts of nh4 n in the soil the nh4 n in the wetting soil was rapidly nitrified which increased the concentration of no3 n high concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n accelerate higher n2o emissions during nitrification and denitrification reactions yang et al 2019 the rapid dissolution of a large amount of fertilizer would partly explain the significantly larger no3 n and nh4 n concentrations that were found in furrow irrigated soil compared to drip irrigated soil figs 4 and 5 the use of furrow irrigation has been shown to lead to higher n2o emissions than drip irrigation sánchez martín et al 2008 the addition of nitrogen fertilizer generally increases n2o emissions signor et al 2013 huang et al 2014 in our study soil in furrow irrigated potato fields emits more n2o than that in drip irrigated potato fields the current study revealed that the cumulative n2o emissions in 2019 were lower than that in 2018 the inter annual difference indicated a possible link between n2o emissions and precipitation in the rainy season under the condition that drip and furrow irrigation measures are consistent in 2018 and 2019 in this study the highest cumulative n2o emissions were mainly observed during the tuber setting and swelling stages of potato growth which occur in july and august respectively the climate of inner mongolia is classified as an arid semi arid region and the annual precipitation is mainly concentrated in july and august the precipitation in 2018 is more than that in 2019 fig 1 after more precipitation the soil surface is moist for a long time and the soil moisture content increases significantly which enhances microbial activity that is conducive to the denitrification process thereby increasing n2o emissions saggar et al 2008 such an effect on n2o emissions was attributed to a stimulated microbial activity from the higher temperature and moisture of soil in july and august resulting in the denitrification the process of denitrification microorganism participated had a significant effect on n2o emissions zhang and han 2008 our study shows a high positive correlation between precipitation and n2o emissions over two years fig 11 similar to our observations a previous study found that the highest n2o emissions occurred during the more rainy season in california s central valley in soils from other arid and semi arid regions kallenbach et al 2010 4 2 drip fertigation can effectively reduce nitrogen leaching losses during potato growth in our study the cumulative no3 n and nh4 n in the soil layer of 40 cm under drip irrigation was less than that under furrow irrigation throughout the potato growing season the highest no3 n content was mainly concentrated in the root zone of the potato to ensure that the potato can effectively absorb nutrition under drip irrigation yang et al 2020 found that water saving irrigation can effectively reduce the amount of leached nitrogen leakage of no3 n under the drip irrigation system was less than that in the furrow irrigation system li et al 2016 this may be owing to the low intensity of drip irrigation weakening the ability of the water to move downwards through the soil nitrogen leaching is an important pathway through which the nitrogen fertilizer applied to the soil for crop growth is lost under furrow irrigation nitrogen in chemical fertilizers mainly exists in a soluble inorganic form that can dissolve rapidly in water after being applied to the soil thereby allowing it to be easily leached by soil water movement under furrow irrigation gilliam et al 2016 in addition with an increase in soil water content in furrow irrigation the adsorption capacity of soil particles to nitrogen decreases which further promotes nitrogen leaching yang et al 2019 the results of the present study confirm this hypothesis and we concluded that the amount of nitrogen leached under drip irrigation is significantly lower than that under furrow irrigation 4 3 relationship between n2o emissions and nitrogen leaching some studies barton et al 2007 ma et al 2010 have shown a positive correlation between n2o emissions and the amount of nitrogen leached while other studies zhou et al 2013 have shown a negative correlation a strong relationship between n2o fluxes and nitrogen leaching losses was found in various potato growth stages in our study fig 12 the results of our study are consistent with those of barton et al 2007 and ma et al 2010 these findings support our hypothesis that in the investigated cropland nitrogen leaching promoted the formation of n2o via denitrification under furrow irrigation n2o emissions tend to be high when nitrogen leaching is high under furrow irrigation potato is a typical crop of shallow root the soil in our study area was chestnut soil with a sandy clay loam texture which has poor ability to intercept water and fertilizer from the point of view of environmental friendliness and reduction of environmental risk the comprehensive technology of water and nutrient management under drip irrigation in potato production has more important practical significance in arid and semi arid areas 4 4 influence of no2 on n2o emissions our results show that the peak no2 concentration was highly consistent with n2o emissions which were mainly concentrated in the first 7 d of the experiment therefore we speculate that the existence of nitrite nitrogen plays an essential role in promoting n2o emissions combining the results of the field experiment laboratory experiment and the conceptual understanding of the mechanisms underlying microbial nitrification and denitrification the mechanism underlying n2o emissions from the soil solution is shown in fig 13 no2 can possibly promote n2o emissions because the existence of no2 in the soil solution inhibits the activity of n2o reductase and promotes n2o emissions this hypothesis can be tested in future studies by performing incubation experiments and measuring the abundance of functional genes associated with nitrogen cycling 5 conclusions changes in n2o emissions and the amount of nitrogen leached at depths of 40 and 80 cm in the soil solution during different potato growth stages were evaluated in drip and furrow irrigated potato fields for 2 years cumulative n2o emissions and nitrogen leaching losses under drip irrigation were less than that under furrow irrigation during various growth stages in potato fields moreover our study showed that the concentration of no2 is positively correlated with n2o emissions and the key role of no2 in n2o emissions was explored compared with conventional irrigation furrow irrigation water saving irrigation drip irrigation can effectively reduce losses owing to n2o emissions and nitrogen leaching it can also improve fertilizer utilization rates increase potato yields and reduce environmental pollution further research is required to explore the microbial mechanisms underlying n2o emissions from no2 using both field and laboratory experiments funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china china grant numbers 42175038 41765010 the program

9768,agricultural policies and social change influence irrigation management decisions and their associated effects the changes in the common agricultural policy of the european union have deeply affected irrigated agriculture in the mediterranean region in this region hydrology is rather complex and the environment particularly vulnerable we monitored cropping patterns and the water balance in a sprinkler irrigated catchment in central portugal over thirteen irrigation seasons and twelve rainfall seasons there was wide variation in annual rainfall from 283 mm to 667 mm and in the intensity of rainfall events from year to year a monitoring station at the catchment outlet was installed to measure runoff which together with field observations allowed us to compute a water balance for both the rainfed and the irrigation seasons changes in cropping intensity led to changes in the depth of irrigation irrigation runoff followed irrigation depth and both followed the trend of cropping intensity less intensive cropping also reduced the off site effects of agricultural activities the runoff coefficient was 0 28 in the rainfed seasons and 0 02 in the irrigation seasons the changes in the irrigation hydrology and in the off site effects of agricultural activities in the catchment were caused by changes in cropping intensity induced by the european union common agricultural policy reforms rather than by environmental or technical factors keywords irrigation performance catchment common agricultural policy runoff coefficient relative irrigation supply irrigation consumptive use coefficient 1 introduction agricultural policies and social change influence the management of land and water resources in ways that can affect the long term productivity and sustainability of farms and the pollution of surrounding hydrological systems farmers policymakers and society at large need to be aware how these off site effects are manifested when aiming to improve the sustainability of agricultural water management wichelns and oster 2006 biggs et al 2015 irrigation management decisions and their associated effects vary among regions according to differences in economics environments and social preferences in portugal the rural population is ageing at one of the highest rates in the european union european commission 2013 ine 2019 ageing appears to be one of the primary causes of the abandonment of agricultural land in portugal and other southern european countries castillo et al 2018 farmers within the european union eu have been subjected to a common agricultural policy cap since the creation of the eu but the cap has changed directions several times aiming at vastly different objectives these policy changes are a major factor in the destabilisation of farming and thus despite the benefits brought about by subsidies they have generated a climate that has not always been conducive to a productive and sustainable agriculture this is particularly true for the irrigated agricultural systems of the interior of southern europe where relatively poor soils and a harsh climate combine to limit the cropping options of farmers to winter cereals and a few summer field crops the lack of promising cropping options limits the long term economic viability of irrigated agriculture in many of those regions the latest policy reforms of the cap eu shifted the subsidies from production of specific crops to the compensation of farmers for income losses favouring payments for land stewardship the responses to such policy change have led to a change in cropping patterns and generally to a reduction in the level of intensification of the irrigated farming systems in the interior of southern european countries despite the long history of agriculture in the region mediterranean type environments are in some ways particularly complex and vulnerable because dry summers make irrigation essential for crop production and because of the intense rainfall that is concentrated during the autumn and winter this hydrological regime has consequences on the one hand it has relatively high irrigation requirements and the associated return flows which can carry high sediment and nutrient loads whilst on the other there are difficulties associated with controlling runoff and percolation in areas where it is not unusual to have intense rainfall events following the irrigation season irrigation performance at a scale greater than that of an individual field is usually assessed by considering a group of farms or all those farms that comprise a single irrigation scheme lorite et al 2004 lozano and mateos 2008 zema et al 2019 however when the objectives include assessing the effects of irrigation on the surrounding environment it is more appropriate to include the catchment domain in performance assessments barros et al 2011 marek et al 2017 merchán et al 2018 samimi et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 the catchment scale is also the preferred domain for water management and its monitoring under the eu water framework directive wfd because at that scale the uncertainties about the magnitudes of the water balance components are the least however because the boundaries of irrigated areas seldom match catchment boundaries it is not always easy to carry out irrigation performance assessments at the catchment scale the objective of this work was the assessment of how the water balance and irrigation performance in an irrigation scheme in a mediterranean environment was affected by the changes in the cropping pattern a gauging station was designed and tested as part of the assessment with the specific purpose of quantifying return flows by using the catchment as the monitoring domain this novel approach based on a long time series differs from conventional irrigation performance assessment and allows establishing causal relationships useful for the evaluation of water and agricultural policies 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study catchment the study catchment is located within the idanha irrigation scheme idanha a nova portugal north of the tagus river fig 1 the climate is mediterranean continental average annual rainfall at ladoeiro 8 5 km east of the catchment fig 1 is 604 mm with a rainless summer the average temperature varies from 8 1 c in january to 25 3 c in august and the average reference evapotranspiration et o varies from 0 6 mm day 1 in december to 7 1 mm day 1 in july apa 2020 the idanha irrigation scheme is supplied by the idanha dam in the ponsul river a tributary of the tagus river the dam was constructed between 1935 and 1950 and is the oldest public irrigation scheme in portugal the farmers in the scheme belong to a water users association water is distributed through a branched open channel network covering 8198 ha of irrigated land centre pivot is the main irrigation method employed in the scheme 90 the channels supply water to on farm reservoirs from which water is pumped to the sprinkler systems the channel system operates without interruption during the irrigation operation with upstream control gates at each division node although the reservoirs belong to the individual farmers and function as on farm regulators their entrance gates and water levels are controlled by employees of the water users association therefore they serve as control elements of the collective network as well this implies that rotation is not necessary and farmers do not need to submit water requests typically the capacity of the on farm reservoirs allows for two irrigation events the catchment studied here covers an area of 189 ha it is divided into 18 fields fig 2 belonging to four farmers about one third of the catchment field 6 in fig 2 is not irrigable and is devoted to a young cork tree forest that was planted in 2001 the cropping pattern and cropping intensity defined as the ratio between the actually cultivated and the total arable areas were recorded from 1 june 2004 to 15 september 2016 the natural drainage network was surveyed in 2004 with the aid of a gps geoexplorer3 trimble navigation ltd california and a reference station that allowed post processing differential correction the main natural creek runs north southwest fig 3a the drainage density of the natural permanent channels is 12 2 m ha 1 the limits and topography of the catchment were determined from a digital elevation model with a precision of 1 m altitude varies from 212 m at the outlet of the catchment to 248 m at a plateau located towards the northeast the slopes range from 0 to 4 thus the topography is flat to gently undulating fig 3a soils in the catchment were mapped based on the soil description and cartography of the region ministério da agricultura pescas e florestas 2004 field inspections photo interpretation and soil samples taken at 17 locations distributed across the catchment fig 3b according to the fao classification system fao 1998 the predominant soil groups in the catchment are luvisol and cambisol which originated from fluvial deposits associated with the tributaries of the tagus river fig 3b fluvisols are also present in the catchment originating from alluvial deposits associated with the main creek the upper 40 cm of the soil in the catchment have a sandy loam or loamy sand texture an impermeable fractured soil layer underlies the three soil classes at a depth of approximately 0 4 m table 1 shows relevant physical and chemical properties of the soils present in the study catchment field capacity and wilting point were estimated from soil texture allen et al 1998 and values were assigned to each field the spatial variation in field capacity and wilting point had little effect on the field water balances computed as described below since the variation in available soil moisture was relatively small table 1 the irrigation method used in the study catchment is sprinkler with four centre pivot units fields 1 3 11 12 and 15 in fig 2 and the rest irrigated by stationary sprinklers the water is pumped from the on farm reservoirs to the sprinkler systems the reservoir that regulates the supply of the northern farm reservoir c fields 1 5 in fig 2 is near the head of a secondary canal the other two farms that were irrigated in the period of study farms composed of fields 8 13 and 14 18 served by reservoirs b and c respectively are located at the tail of a fourth order branch fig 2 each sprinkler system was evaluated once each season following keller and bliesner 1990 procedures to determine its uniformity and application intensity in addition each farmer recorded the time and duration of each irrigation event throughout each season application intensity and duration were used to compute the applied depth for each irrigation event distribution uniformity keller and bliesner 1990 varied between 77 and 86 these values being in the range of fair to good uniformity all other farming activities soil tillage pesticide application fertiliser application planting and harvesting were also recorded on a form completed with our assistance by each farmer these records detailed the date type of machinery used product type and amount and other ancillary information 2 2 the hydrological station a hydrological station was constructed and installed in 2004 to measure runoff at the outlet of the catchment 39 50 48 n 7 10 00 w the station consisted of a long throated flume with a triangular control section for shallow water conditions and a triangular trapezoidal section for deep water conditions designed and calibrated following the procedure described by bos et al 1991 fig 4 an ultrasonic sensor the probe manufactured by milltronics siemens milltronics process instruments inc ontario canada connected to a datalogger continuously measured and recorded the water level at the flume in this study we present runoff data for the period 1 june 2004 15 september 2016 originally rainfall was measured continuously with a tipping bucket rain gauge located next to the hydrological station the early failure of this rain gauge forced the use of rainfall data from nearby weather stations during the years 2004 2012 we used the weather data from the ladoeiro weather station 39 49 48 n 7 16 1 w belonging to the portuguese environmental agency and located within the idanha irrigation scheme fig 1 subsequently the water users association of the idanha irrigation scheme installed its own weather station in cascalhal 39 51 36 n 7 11 5 w nearer to the hydrological station fig 1 so that from 2013 to 2016 the data used in this study were those obtained at the cascalhal station although both weather stations collect data every 10 min we use daily aggregations of precipitation and averages of the necessary variables to calculate et o i e solar radiation maximum and minimum temperature and relative humidity and wind speed 2 3 water balance a daily root zone water balance was computed for each individual field in the catchment this was undertaken first to determine the optimum irrigation schedule and resulting evapotranspiration and second to estimate evapotranspiration and catchment deep percolation under the actual irrigation schedule the water balance was formulated as follows 1 r z w d i r z w d i 1 r i i i e t i r o i d p i where rzwd i and rzwd i 1 mm are the root zone soil water depletion on days i and i 1 respectively and r i mm i i et i ro i and dp i all in mm are rainfall irrigation crop evapotranspiration irrigation runoff and deep percolation respectively on day i it is assumed that the root zone is full of water rzwd 0 when its water content is at field capacity and that it is devoid of water when the water content is at the wilting point therefore for the purpose of the crop water balance runoff plus deep percolation was calculated as the root zone soil water content in excess of field capacity rainfall and irrigation amounts for each field were obtained as explained in previous sections evapotranspiration was estimated using the fao methodology based on the concepts of crop coefficient and reference evapotranspiration doorenbos and pruitt 1977 reference evapotranspiration et o mm was calculated using the fao penman monteith equation monteith and unsworth 1990 allen et al 1998 with data pertaining to solar radiation wind speed air temperature and relative humidity acquired from the selected weather stations the crop coefficients were derived using the dual approach wright 1982 in the manner proposed by the fao allen et al 1998 the fao approach treats crop transpiration and evaporation from the soil surface separately as follows 2 e t k c b k s k e e t o where k cb is the basal crop coefficient k e is the soil evaporation coefficient and k s quantifies the reduction in crop transpiration due to the soil water deficit the variation in k cb is typically traced from the values of k cb at the initial intermediate and final stages of crop growth and the duration of the initial rapid growth mid season and late season phases a specific k cb curve was drawn for each field based on the dates of planting and harvesting and on sporadic field observations of ground cover the coefficient k e was calculated taking into consideration topsoil wetting events due to irrigation or rainfall and the availability of energy at the soil surface following the procedure described by allen et al 1998 the stress coefficient k s was assumed to be unity when the root zone soil water content was greater than a characteristic value that varied from crop to crop below which transpiration is restricted and reduced linearly from that point to reach zero at the root zone water content at the wilting point allen et al 1998 the root zone depth was calculated as a function of k cb assuming that the depth increases linearly from a minimum seedling rooting depth reaching maximum rooting depth when k cb reaches its maximum value fereres et al 1981 when the root zone soil water balance model was used to estimate evapotranspiration under the optimum irrigation schedule et et potential irrigation was triggered at a value of rzwd equal to the management defined depletion here et potential is defined as the et in the absence of water deficits that reduce crop transpiration for the optimum schedule the required depth of irrigation was that needed to return the root zone back to field capacity rzwd 0 when the model was used to estimate the actual evapotranspiration of each field et et actual the recorded irrigation dates and depths were entered into the water balance model catchment deep percolation was estimated as the residual component in the catchment water balance as follows 3 d p δ r z w d r i e t a c t u a l r o where the addends now refer to the entire catchment therefore the main uncertainty in the water balance stems from the uncertainty in the estimate of et which affects the estimation of dp as well the water balance was computed for the period 1 june 2004 15 september 2016 except for the irrigation season of 2011 when the datalogger failed irrigation and rainfed seasons were analysed separately the date separating the irrigation seasons from their subsequent rainfed season was 15 september the date separating the rainfed seasons from their subsequent irrigation season was 1 june except in 2006 and 2007 when it was 15 june 2 4 water use indicators irrigation performance and catchment water usage were quantified for various periods using the following indicators molden and gates 1990 burt et al 1997 4 deficitcoefficient d c 1 e t a c t u a l e t p o t e n t i a l 5 relativewatersupply r w s r i e t p o t e n t i a l 6 relativeirrigationsupply r i s i i r e q u i r e d 7 runoffcoefficient r o c r o r 8 irrigationconsumptiveusecoefficient i c u c e t i i δ s e t a c t u a l r i δ s icuc is equivalent to the irrigation efficiency if it is assumed that the only beneficial use of irrigation water is crop evapotranspiration therefore icuc is defined as the ratio between the irrigation water used beneficially which we define here as the irrigation water that is consumed as et et i and the irrigation water applied i minus the increment of irrigation water storage δs during the period of interest burt et al 1997 the volume of irrigation water consumed as et was calculated as the difference between et actual and rainfall during the period of interest et i et actual r 3 results 3 1 cropping pattern of the 189 ha of the catchment 130 4 ha are irrigable with the remaining 58 6 ha field 6 in fig 2 being used for a cork tree plantation maize and tobacco were the two main crops in the first irrigation season studied table 2 the cropping pattern of this season may be considered as the baseline since in earlier years from 1990 to 2003 these two crops predominated in the idanha irrigation scheme after the third irrigation season tobacco was no longer grown in the catchment and the area devoted to maize fluctuated table 2 both changes were driven by the last reform of the eu cap that substituted subsidies for the production of these crops by a fixed payment for land stewardship fluctuation of the area devoted to maize and subsequent reduction of its area was also due to variations in grain prices on the international market sorghum soybean and ryegrass initially substituted tobacco and maize although more recently the catchment has oriented its production to grass and ryegrass for livestock grazing the cropping intensity ci here defined as the ratio of arable to cultivated area never recovered to its baseline values table 2 since the cropping pattern in the catchment is largely determined by what is grown in field 3 the general decreasing trend of ci can be more clearly seen by computing this indicator for the entire idanha irrigation scheme fig 5 the mean decreasing rate from 2004 was 2 6 year 1 1 2 year 1 in the entire scheme the maximum catchment ci in the irrigation season was 0 81 in the first year of analysis when ci in the rainfed season was 0 23 a value that decreased during 2006 2009 period to recover the initial value after the 2009 10 rainfed seasons table 2 oats and wheat were the main rainfed crops grown during the first part of the study period currently the largest portion of the irrigable area in the catchment is left fallow during the rainfed season except the area reserved for grazing all along the year 3 2 patterns of rainfall irrigation and runoff during the second fortnight of october 2004 there was rainfall of 139 mm the first rainfall event in this period 20 october was of 40 mm producing only 4 4 mm of runoff whereas the last rainfall event 27 october although having almost the same rainfall than the first event 42 mm resulted in much greater runoff 37 mm roc 0 84 at that time the catchment was occupied by mature maize the oak plantation and fallow the hyetograph and hydrograph of these two events exemplified the typical hydrological response of the catchment fig 6 the hydrographs increased shortly after the start of the storms the runoff peak of the first event was 0 23 m3 s 1 fig 6 while the peak of the second hydrograph was 2 56 m3 s 1 fig 6 other examples illustrated how rainfall patterns and soil water content interact in determining the roc during the rainfed season when intense rainfall episodes occurred on fallow ground and after previous precipitation events that had wetted the soil surface roc increased dramatically in contrast if rainfall was evenly distributed without very intense episodes and winter crops covered the ground roc diminished substantially for instance although in the 2005 06 season there was almost twice as much rain than in the preceding season table 3 there were hardly any episodes of intense rainfall and the rain was distributed evenly the soil moisture content was therefore relatively constant and the roc for each of the rainfall events did not vary markedly in the next rainfed season 2006 07 the first major rainfall event occurred between 16 and 27 october only interrupted by one day without rainfall the first period of the event 58 mm of rain generated 0 4 mm of runoff only while the second period 168 mm produced 42 mm of runoff the preceding rainfall provoked this dramatic change in roc from 0 01 to 0 25 in 2007 08 the autumn rainfalls started later than usual despite the significant amount of rain 79 mm during the first relevant events 19 22 november there was little runoff 2 mm however the next significant rain 35 mm during 2 5 january fell on wet or relatively wet soil generating 8 mm of runoff more examples of this behaviour were identified in subsequent rain seasons fig 7 condensed the rainfall runoff response of a set of 38 events selected along the study period considering that they were isolated or relatively isolated thus the pattern of their hyetograph hydrographs could be interpreted more easily as expected runoff increased with rainfall however the slope of the runoff rainfall relationship tended to be greater as the preceding soil moisture here estimated as rainfall during the 10 day precedent period increased fig 7 a multiple linear regression analysis showed that rainfall explained 38 r2 0 38 of the variance of runoff while adding the variable 10 day preceding rainfall it was explained 47 of the variance of runoff r2 0 47 according to the multiple linear regression each mm of rainfall increased runoff by 0 32 mm while each mm of 10 day preceding rainfall increased runoff by 0 12 mm precipitation intensity surely had an important effect also borga and morin 2014 although the location and time resolution of our rainfall data did not allow for verification of this hypothesis regarding the irrigation season runoff was significant in 2004 and 2008 also in 2011 although that year the gauging station was out of service small in 2005 2006 and 2010 and negligible in 2007 2009 and the years 2012 2016 table 3 the seasonal roc did not exceed 0 09 table 4 the daily evolution of irrigation runoff is shown in fig 8 for 2008 one of the three years with most irrigation runoff increased with some oscillations up to a peak in mid august fig 8 mean runoff rate was 0 19 mm day 1 and peak runoff 1 1 mm day 1 the oscillations in runoff observed in 2008 and the other years with significant irrigation were associated with the on off cycles of the centre pivots used in the catchment for irrigation the relationships that determine roc illustrated above may be summarised in terms of the monthly values of mean rainfall irrigation runoff and roc fig 9 the dominant water input in june july and august was from irrigation in those months mean roc was less than 0 10 with the highest value in august may and september were the month when both irrigation and rainfall occurred thus their effects on runoff were mixed october was the month with highest mean rainfall however mean roc 0 16 was less than in any other month in autumn or winter mean roc increased from october into the winter up to 0 48 in february to decreased into the spring fig 9 in april despite mean rainfall being as high as it was in february or march the mean roc decreased to 0 16 indicating that evapotranspiration in that month contributed more to soil drying than it did in previous months 3 3 seasonal water balance and water use indicators mean annual rainfall for the 12 complete water years october 1 through september 30 in the study period 493 mm was below the long term mean of 604 mm 85 years in two of the 12 years 2004 2005 and 2011 2012 rainfall was almost half of the 12 year mean while in one year it was about 35 greater than the mean table 3 the roc in the rainfed season varied between 0 10 and 0 50 table 4 the year 2004 2005 was one of the two years with least rainfall however its roc was 0 36 table 4 estimated deep percolation in the rainfed season exceeded measured runoff in 2 of the 12 monitored seasons table 3 with respect to the irrigation season the irrigation depth applied over the area varied between 26 mm in 2009 and 333 mm in 2004 table 3 irrigation runoff followed irrigation depth and both followed the trend of ci during the irrigation season fig 10 total return flow measured runoff plus estimated deep percolation was also correlated with ci fig 10 the recorded fraction of runoff water was greatest for the two irrigation seasons with greatest irrigation depth viz 2004 and 2008 tables 3 and 4 unfortunately runoff in 2011 was not recorded which could have confirmed or rejected this trend the icuc was only computed for the years in which irrigation was significant 2004 2005 2008 and 2011 with irrigation depth greater than 100 mm when the irrigation depth is relatively shallow the two terms in the numerator of eq 8 have similar magnitudes and the same occurs with the terms in the denominator thus small errors in the water balance used to compute et actual and δs could lead to large errors in icuc icuc was relatively high in the catchment varying between 0 80 in 2004 and 0 90 in 2008 table 4 ris was one or greater than one in the years of more water supply 2004 2008 and 2011 while it was significantly less than one in the interval 0 26 0 79 in the rest of the years table 4 this suggested that reduction of irrigation on the catchment was related not only to ci but also to a shift towards a deficit irrigation strategy this was supported by the estimated deficit coefficient which was less than 0 37 in the later group of irrigation seasons whereas it was greater than 0 54 in the former table 4 although it should be noted that dc computed for irrigation seasons where there was short supply is subject to errors similar to those previously described for icuc the shallow or relatively shallow irrigation depths in the 2006 2010 irrigation seasons except the season of 2008 contrasted with the excess of water during the subsequent rainfed seasons the rws was less than and greater than one in 5 and 7 of the 12 rain seasons respectively table 4 indicating that crop water demand was not matched by water supply in the former and suggesting that the crops could have enough water supply in the latter this was corroborated by the estimated dc which was greater than 0 39 the years with rws less than one 3 4 variability in water usage among fields water usage varied from crop to crop the area weighted mean ris for the study period was 1 04 0 66 0 54 and 0 14 for maize tobacco grass and sorghum respectively apparently maize was the crop for which water deficit was avoided however there was a farm pattern as well the area weighted mean ris for the period of study was 0 86 in the northern farm fields 1 5 in fig 2 and 0 47 in the two southern farms fields 7 18 while maize dominated production in the northern farm 80 of the total area over the study it was seldom grown in the southern farms this could explain crop and farm ris variations in order to understand these differences we interviewed the scheme manager and the catchment farmers and found another factor that could explain ris variations the delivery capacity of the distribution system could be insufficient to satisfy full irrigation demand in mid summer at the two southern farms whereas the reservoir of the northern farm is served by a first order channel branch with a capacity of 650 l s 1 the reservoirs of the two southern farms are located at the tail of a fourth order branch with a capacity of 65 l s 1 at its head this is just about sufficient to deliver the full irrigation requirements of these farms however when seepage losses are subtracted and when control of the channel reservoir network is suboptimal which is normally the case these tail farms could suffer water shortages in some irrigation seasons 4 discussion in 2005 47 of the portuguese rural population was older than 65 years ine 2007 this statistic was representative of the study catchment where two of the four farmers were older than 65 years moreover since 2005 the cap reforms have affected farming activities in the idanha irrigation schemes by discouraging farmers from growing tobacco and other crops formerly of importance in the scheme and also discouraging them from taking new intensification initiatives the combination of social change aging and lack of generational renovation and the cap reform led to changes in patterns of water use in the study catchment we have compared the acreages devoted to different crops in the study catchment and the whole irrigation scheme since 2004 we found that the study catchment was representative of the whole scheme as its allocation to different crops was similar to that of the irrigation scheme the fact that irrigation water is delivered to the farms in the catchment from channel branches of different orders first and fourth further supported the catchment as the unit of analysis representative of the whole scheme in years of low cropping intensity irrigation water usage was reduced as was irrigation return flow and apparently the fraction of return flows the cropping pattern in the study catchment changed drastically from the first to the second irrigation season this trend became even more pronounced in irrigation seasons 2006 and 2007 and was then partially reversed in the 2008 irrigation season due to the international increase in grain prices cropping intensity fluctuated but showed an overall decreasing trend that was evident when examined for the entire idanha irrigation scheme fig 5 an important feature of irrigation performance that distinguishes seasons with high and low usage of irrigation water was evidenced by the ris indicator that took values greater than 1 and smaller than 0 80 in the years with high and low irrigation water use respectively the same pattern was reflected in the irrigation consumptive use coefficient which took values around 0 90 and 0 80 in the low and high water usage years respectively table 4 a value of icuc less than 0 80 is generally found to be characteristic of traditional irrigation schemes whereas values around 0 90 are encountered in modern irrigation schemes or in irrigation schemes with a high level of water re use mateos el al 2000 isidoro et al 2004 causapé 2009 barros et al 2012 the irrigation scheme studied cannot be classified as modern nor does it re use water however the high icuc in years of low ris highlights the fact that icuc depends not only on irrigation system characteristics but also on the applied water depth losada et al 1990 which is something that is frequently overlooked when water plans are being developed for catchments that suffer water deficit several studies have documented changes of irrigation performance indicators with different crops and their disposition in space and time tedeschi et al 2001 calculated an irrigation performance indicator equal to the inverse of ris that varied from crop to crop and over the irrigation season these authors interpreted these variations on the basis of cultivation practices and crop productivity goals similar interpretations of ris variations were presented by lorite et al 2004 who related yield to productivity targets determined by the crop subsidy causapé et al 2004 and goncalves et al 2015 reported variations in an indicator equivalent to the rws that were attributed to the irrigation method flood or sprinkler and or soil differences across the irrigation scheme barros et al 2012 reported changes in the irrigation consumptive use coefficient due to modernisation of the on farm and delivery irrigation systems lozano and mateos 2008 estimated ris variations among the sectors of an irrigation scheme that were relatively small for a given delivery schedule but varied notably between alternative delivery schedules recently benavides et al 2021 have reviewed technical factors determining ris concluding that the characteristics of modern schemes tend to decrease ris while the variations of ris observed by these various authors were driven by environmental agronomic or irrigation system factors the variations of ris and icuc observed in this study were caused mainly by a reduction of cropping intensity in the catchment area which in turn was caused by socio economic changes the hydrological behaviour of an irrigated catchment in a mediterranean climate can be expected to differ markedly between the rainfed season and the irrigation season cid et al 2016 even if the volume of precipitation was the same as the applied irrigation water the highly variable intensity and the frequency of rainfall events are very different from the constant intensity and the regular depth and frequency of irrigation events fig 8 moreover while the soil is bare or sparsely vegetated during the rainfed season the fraction of ground covered by vegetation nearly doubles during the irrigation season the marked climatic seasonality and the stochastic pattern of rainfall of the mediterranean climate make the rainfall runoff relationship particularly complex in this type of environment beven 2002 peña angulo et al 2019 martínez mena et al 2020 for instance the inter seasonal variability of rainfall accounted for the fact that in the second rainfed season of the period of analysis 2005 06 twice as much rain fell as in the previous year however the distribution of rainfall within each season was such that runoff in both years was rather similar table 3 another feature revealed in this study was the dependence of the roc on the preceding rainfall which was consistent with the findings of latron and gallart 2008 they also described based on an exhaustive monitoring of soil moisture and water table depth across a mediterranean catchment different hydrographic patterns which were characteristic of the dry wetting up and wet periods the first rainfed season studied 2004 05 probably represented an extreme situation the small amount of rain that fell during this season produced a roc of 0 36 which contrasted with a roc of 0 10 in another dry rainfed season 2011 12 the latter value was similar to those measured by ceballos and schnabel 1998 in a nearby catchment in years of similar rainfall land use in ceballos and schnabel s catchment was agro silvo pastoral and the size of the catchment was only 35 ha however casalí et al 2008 presented ten year averages for roc of 0 30 and 0 23 in two rainfed agricultural catchments of 207 ha and 169 ha respectively in northern spain these values are similar to the 11 year mean roc of 0 28 obtained at our study catchment in the rain seasons the complexity of the interaction between factors affecting runoff in mediterranean watersheds has been analysed recently by taguas et al 2017 while schoener and stone 2019 have highlighted the difficulties of upscaling small plot observations to watershed scale it appears that the hydrology of the idanha catchment was more affected by rainfall than by irrigation in that regard the concentration of runoff in the autumn which often occurs in this environment has the potential to wash away and erode soil irrespective of whether the cropping system is irrigated or rainfed serpa et al 2015 rodriguez lloveras et al 2016 mediterranean irrigated agriculture is more intensive in terms of the agrochemical applications it receives than rainfed agriculture a fraction of these agrochemicals remains in the irrigated soils after harvest ready to be washed out by the runoff resulting from autumn rainfall in our study the first flush effect obermann et al 2007 was apparent during the intense rainfall events like the event occurred on 27 october 2004 fig 6 and the consequent runoff peak that washed a significant amount of sediment and nitrogen out of the catchment duarte 2011 2017 similar effect was reported by merchán et al 2018 for an irrigated watershed in northern spain monitoring the hydrology of the catchment revealed a number of relationships that are important to document in order to assess the interactions between the eu cap which influences cropping pattern and intensity and water policies such as the eu water framework directive wfd that established the regulations for water usage and conservation in the eu the hydrological station installed at the outlet of the study catchment and the protocol for recording water inputs and outputs both proved to be effective instruments for a water usage monitoring programme in mediterranean environments furthermore the concept of catchment as the monitoring unit is consistent with the principles embedded in the wfd 5 conclusions irrigation water use irrigation return flow and the fraction of irrigation return flows varied notably in the study catchment during the years of monitoring the changes in land use in the catchment led to changes in the irrigated area and in the depth of applied irrigation water the reduction in cropping intensity not only elicited a better performance as judged by the increased irrigation consumptive use coefficient but must have also reduced the environmental impact of irrigation the changes in the irrigation hydrology and in the off site effects of agricultural activities appeared to be due to the effects of agricultural policy reforms rather than to environmental or technical factors the hydrological behaviour of the catchment was quite different in the rainfed and irrigation seasons the runoff coefficient was much greater in the rainfed seasons than in the irrigation seasons in addition the dependence of this coefficient on soil moisture was evidenced in the rainfed seasons while any such dependence was masked during the irrigation seasons by the regular application of water and its constant intensity the eu wfd adopted the catchment as the appropriate water management domain for which precise monitoring is essential hydrological stations such as the one designed and used for the evaluation of a small catchment in this study should become part of a programme for following up the interaction between cap reforms and the implementation and effectiveness of the wfd in the agricultural sector our study supports the recommendation by other authors barros et al 2012 merchán et al 2018 of monitoring the quality of the return flows as part of future research although this research approach does not have a conventional experimental design it is based on thorough quantitative observations of natural events and uncontrolled farming activities natural experiments in their real conditions as the time series is longer the cause effect relationships induced from those observations gain robustness which explains its more and more widespread acceptance in scientific research the recommendation derived from these conclusions is that agricultural policies that affect mediterranean agroecosystems are supported with water accounting that allows evaluating whether the effects of these policies are as expected or not for this purpose hydrological studies in irrigated catchments such as the one proposed here should be generalised declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the

9768,agricultural policies and social change influence irrigation management decisions and their associated effects the changes in the common agricultural policy of the european union have deeply affected irrigated agriculture in the mediterranean region in this region hydrology is rather complex and the environment particularly vulnerable we monitored cropping patterns and the water balance in a sprinkler irrigated catchment in central portugal over thirteen irrigation seasons and twelve rainfall seasons there was wide variation in annual rainfall from 283 mm to 667 mm and in the intensity of rainfall events from year to year a monitoring station at the catchment outlet was installed to measure runoff which together with field observations allowed us to compute a water balance for both the rainfed and the irrigation seasons changes in cropping intensity led to changes in the depth of irrigation irrigation runoff followed irrigation depth and both followed the trend of cropping intensity less intensive cropping also reduced the off site effects of agricultural activities the runoff coefficient was 0 28 in the rainfed seasons and 0 02 in the irrigation seasons the changes in the irrigation hydrology and in the off site effects of agricultural activities in the catchment were caused by changes in cropping intensity induced by the european union common agricultural policy reforms rather than by environmental or technical factors keywords irrigation performance catchment common agricultural policy runoff coefficient relative irrigation supply irrigation consumptive use coefficient 1 introduction agricultural policies and social change influence the management of land and water resources in ways that can affect the long term productivity and sustainability of farms and the pollution of surrounding hydrological systems farmers policymakers and society at large need to be aware how these off site effects are manifested when aiming to improve the sustainability of agricultural water management wichelns and oster 2006 biggs et al 2015 irrigation management decisions and their associated effects vary among regions according to differences in economics environments and social preferences in portugal the rural population is ageing at one of the highest rates in the european union european commission 2013 ine 2019 ageing appears to be one of the primary causes of the abandonment of agricultural land in portugal and other southern european countries castillo et al 2018 farmers within the european union eu have been subjected to a common agricultural policy cap since the creation of the eu but the cap has changed directions several times aiming at vastly different objectives these policy changes are a major factor in the destabilisation of farming and thus despite the benefits brought about by subsidies they have generated a climate that has not always been conducive to a productive and sustainable agriculture this is particularly true for the irrigated agricultural systems of the interior of southern europe where relatively poor soils and a harsh climate combine to limit the cropping options of farmers to winter cereals and a few summer field crops the lack of promising cropping options limits the long term economic viability of irrigated agriculture in many of those regions the latest policy reforms of the cap eu shifted the subsidies from production of specific crops to the compensation of farmers for income losses favouring payments for land stewardship the responses to such policy change have led to a change in cropping patterns and generally to a reduction in the level of intensification of the irrigated farming systems in the interior of southern european countries despite the long history of agriculture in the region mediterranean type environments are in some ways particularly complex and vulnerable because dry summers make irrigation essential for crop production and because of the intense rainfall that is concentrated during the autumn and winter this hydrological regime has consequences on the one hand it has relatively high irrigation requirements and the associated return flows which can carry high sediment and nutrient loads whilst on the other there are difficulties associated with controlling runoff and percolation in areas where it is not unusual to have intense rainfall events following the irrigation season irrigation performance at a scale greater than that of an individual field is usually assessed by considering a group of farms or all those farms that comprise a single irrigation scheme lorite et al 2004 lozano and mateos 2008 zema et al 2019 however when the objectives include assessing the effects of irrigation on the surrounding environment it is more appropriate to include the catchment domain in performance assessments barros et al 2011 marek et al 2017 merchán et al 2018 samimi et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 the catchment scale is also the preferred domain for water management and its monitoring under the eu water framework directive wfd because at that scale the uncertainties about the magnitudes of the water balance components are the least however because the boundaries of irrigated areas seldom match catchment boundaries it is not always easy to carry out irrigation performance assessments at the catchment scale the objective of this work was the assessment of how the water balance and irrigation performance in an irrigation scheme in a mediterranean environment was affected by the changes in the cropping pattern a gauging station was designed and tested as part of the assessment with the specific purpose of quantifying return flows by using the catchment as the monitoring domain this novel approach based on a long time series differs from conventional irrigation performance assessment and allows establishing causal relationships useful for the evaluation of water and agricultural policies 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study catchment the study catchment is located within the idanha irrigation scheme idanha a nova portugal north of the tagus river fig 1 the climate is mediterranean continental average annual rainfall at ladoeiro 8 5 km east of the catchment fig 1 is 604 mm with a rainless summer the average temperature varies from 8 1 c in january to 25 3 c in august and the average reference evapotranspiration et o varies from 0 6 mm day 1 in december to 7 1 mm day 1 in july apa 2020 the idanha irrigation scheme is supplied by the idanha dam in the ponsul river a tributary of the tagus river the dam was constructed between 1935 and 1950 and is the oldest public irrigation scheme in portugal the farmers in the scheme belong to a water users association water is distributed through a branched open channel network covering 8198 ha of irrigated land centre pivot is the main irrigation method employed in the scheme 90 the channels supply water to on farm reservoirs from which water is pumped to the sprinkler systems the channel system operates without interruption during the irrigation operation with upstream control gates at each division node although the reservoirs belong to the individual farmers and function as on farm regulators their entrance gates and water levels are controlled by employees of the water users association therefore they serve as control elements of the collective network as well this implies that rotation is not necessary and farmers do not need to submit water requests typically the capacity of the on farm reservoirs allows for two irrigation events the catchment studied here covers an area of 189 ha it is divided into 18 fields fig 2 belonging to four farmers about one third of the catchment field 6 in fig 2 is not irrigable and is devoted to a young cork tree forest that was planted in 2001 the cropping pattern and cropping intensity defined as the ratio between the actually cultivated and the total arable areas were recorded from 1 june 2004 to 15 september 2016 the natural drainage network was surveyed in 2004 with the aid of a gps geoexplorer3 trimble navigation ltd california and a reference station that allowed post processing differential correction the main natural creek runs north southwest fig 3a the drainage density of the natural permanent channels is 12 2 m ha 1 the limits and topography of the catchment were determined from a digital elevation model with a precision of 1 m altitude varies from 212 m at the outlet of the catchment to 248 m at a plateau located towards the northeast the slopes range from 0 to 4 thus the topography is flat to gently undulating fig 3a soils in the catchment were mapped based on the soil description and cartography of the region ministério da agricultura pescas e florestas 2004 field inspections photo interpretation and soil samples taken at 17 locations distributed across the catchment fig 3b according to the fao classification system fao 1998 the predominant soil groups in the catchment are luvisol and cambisol which originated from fluvial deposits associated with the tributaries of the tagus river fig 3b fluvisols are also present in the catchment originating from alluvial deposits associated with the main creek the upper 40 cm of the soil in the catchment have a sandy loam or loamy sand texture an impermeable fractured soil layer underlies the three soil classes at a depth of approximately 0 4 m table 1 shows relevant physical and chemical properties of the soils present in the study catchment field capacity and wilting point were estimated from soil texture allen et al 1998 and values were assigned to each field the spatial variation in field capacity and wilting point had little effect on the field water balances computed as described below since the variation in available soil moisture was relatively small table 1 the irrigation method used in the study catchment is sprinkler with four centre pivot units fields 1 3 11 12 and 15 in fig 2 and the rest irrigated by stationary sprinklers the water is pumped from the on farm reservoirs to the sprinkler systems the reservoir that regulates the supply of the northern farm reservoir c fields 1 5 in fig 2 is near the head of a secondary canal the other two farms that were irrigated in the period of study farms composed of fields 8 13 and 14 18 served by reservoirs b and c respectively are located at the tail of a fourth order branch fig 2 each sprinkler system was evaluated once each season following keller and bliesner 1990 procedures to determine its uniformity and application intensity in addition each farmer recorded the time and duration of each irrigation event throughout each season application intensity and duration were used to compute the applied depth for each irrigation event distribution uniformity keller and bliesner 1990 varied between 77 and 86 these values being in the range of fair to good uniformity all other farming activities soil tillage pesticide application fertiliser application planting and harvesting were also recorded on a form completed with our assistance by each farmer these records detailed the date type of machinery used product type and amount and other ancillary information 2 2 the hydrological station a hydrological station was constructed and installed in 2004 to measure runoff at the outlet of the catchment 39 50 48 n 7 10 00 w the station consisted of a long throated flume with a triangular control section for shallow water conditions and a triangular trapezoidal section for deep water conditions designed and calibrated following the procedure described by bos et al 1991 fig 4 an ultrasonic sensor the probe manufactured by milltronics siemens milltronics process instruments inc ontario canada connected to a datalogger continuously measured and recorded the water level at the flume in this study we present runoff data for the period 1 june 2004 15 september 2016 originally rainfall was measured continuously with a tipping bucket rain gauge located next to the hydrological station the early failure of this rain gauge forced the use of rainfall data from nearby weather stations during the years 2004 2012 we used the weather data from the ladoeiro weather station 39 49 48 n 7 16 1 w belonging to the portuguese environmental agency and located within the idanha irrigation scheme fig 1 subsequently the water users association of the idanha irrigation scheme installed its own weather station in cascalhal 39 51 36 n 7 11 5 w nearer to the hydrological station fig 1 so that from 2013 to 2016 the data used in this study were those obtained at the cascalhal station although both weather stations collect data every 10 min we use daily aggregations of precipitation and averages of the necessary variables to calculate et o i e solar radiation maximum and minimum temperature and relative humidity and wind speed 2 3 water balance a daily root zone water balance was computed for each individual field in the catchment this was undertaken first to determine the optimum irrigation schedule and resulting evapotranspiration and second to estimate evapotranspiration and catchment deep percolation under the actual irrigation schedule the water balance was formulated as follows 1 r z w d i r z w d i 1 r i i i e t i r o i d p i where rzwd i and rzwd i 1 mm are the root zone soil water depletion on days i and i 1 respectively and r i mm i i et i ro i and dp i all in mm are rainfall irrigation crop evapotranspiration irrigation runoff and deep percolation respectively on day i it is assumed that the root zone is full of water rzwd 0 when its water content is at field capacity and that it is devoid of water when the water content is at the wilting point therefore for the purpose of the crop water balance runoff plus deep percolation was calculated as the root zone soil water content in excess of field capacity rainfall and irrigation amounts for each field were obtained as explained in previous sections evapotranspiration was estimated using the fao methodology based on the concepts of crop coefficient and reference evapotranspiration doorenbos and pruitt 1977 reference evapotranspiration et o mm was calculated using the fao penman monteith equation monteith and unsworth 1990 allen et al 1998 with data pertaining to solar radiation wind speed air temperature and relative humidity acquired from the selected weather stations the crop coefficients were derived using the dual approach wright 1982 in the manner proposed by the fao allen et al 1998 the fao approach treats crop transpiration and evaporation from the soil surface separately as follows 2 e t k c b k s k e e t o where k cb is the basal crop coefficient k e is the soil evaporation coefficient and k s quantifies the reduction in crop transpiration due to the soil water deficit the variation in k cb is typically traced from the values of k cb at the initial intermediate and final stages of crop growth and the duration of the initial rapid growth mid season and late season phases a specific k cb curve was drawn for each field based on the dates of planting and harvesting and on sporadic field observations of ground cover the coefficient k e was calculated taking into consideration topsoil wetting events due to irrigation or rainfall and the availability of energy at the soil surface following the procedure described by allen et al 1998 the stress coefficient k s was assumed to be unity when the root zone soil water content was greater than a characteristic value that varied from crop to crop below which transpiration is restricted and reduced linearly from that point to reach zero at the root zone water content at the wilting point allen et al 1998 the root zone depth was calculated as a function of k cb assuming that the depth increases linearly from a minimum seedling rooting depth reaching maximum rooting depth when k cb reaches its maximum value fereres et al 1981 when the root zone soil water balance model was used to estimate evapotranspiration under the optimum irrigation schedule et et potential irrigation was triggered at a value of rzwd equal to the management defined depletion here et potential is defined as the et in the absence of water deficits that reduce crop transpiration for the optimum schedule the required depth of irrigation was that needed to return the root zone back to field capacity rzwd 0 when the model was used to estimate the actual evapotranspiration of each field et et actual the recorded irrigation dates and depths were entered into the water balance model catchment deep percolation was estimated as the residual component in the catchment water balance as follows 3 d p δ r z w d r i e t a c t u a l r o where the addends now refer to the entire catchment therefore the main uncertainty in the water balance stems from the uncertainty in the estimate of et which affects the estimation of dp as well the water balance was computed for the period 1 june 2004 15 september 2016 except for the irrigation season of 2011 when the datalogger failed irrigation and rainfed seasons were analysed separately the date separating the irrigation seasons from their subsequent rainfed season was 15 september the date separating the rainfed seasons from their subsequent irrigation season was 1 june except in 2006 and 2007 when it was 15 june 2 4 water use indicators irrigation performance and catchment water usage were quantified for various periods using the following indicators molden and gates 1990 burt et al 1997 4 deficitcoefficient d c 1 e t a c t u a l e t p o t e n t i a l 5 relativewatersupply r w s r i e t p o t e n t i a l 6 relativeirrigationsupply r i s i i r e q u i r e d 7 runoffcoefficient r o c r o r 8 irrigationconsumptiveusecoefficient i c u c e t i i δ s e t a c t u a l r i δ s icuc is equivalent to the irrigation efficiency if it is assumed that the only beneficial use of irrigation water is crop evapotranspiration therefore icuc is defined as the ratio between the irrigation water used beneficially which we define here as the irrigation water that is consumed as et et i and the irrigation water applied i minus the increment of irrigation water storage δs during the period of interest burt et al 1997 the volume of irrigation water consumed as et was calculated as the difference between et actual and rainfall during the period of interest et i et actual r 3 results 3 1 cropping pattern of the 189 ha of the catchment 130 4 ha are irrigable with the remaining 58 6 ha field 6 in fig 2 being used for a cork tree plantation maize and tobacco were the two main crops in the first irrigation season studied table 2 the cropping pattern of this season may be considered as the baseline since in earlier years from 1990 to 2003 these two crops predominated in the idanha irrigation scheme after the third irrigation season tobacco was no longer grown in the catchment and the area devoted to maize fluctuated table 2 both changes were driven by the last reform of the eu cap that substituted subsidies for the production of these crops by a fixed payment for land stewardship fluctuation of the area devoted to maize and subsequent reduction of its area was also due to variations in grain prices on the international market sorghum soybean and ryegrass initially substituted tobacco and maize although more recently the catchment has oriented its production to grass and ryegrass for livestock grazing the cropping intensity ci here defined as the ratio of arable to cultivated area never recovered to its baseline values table 2 since the cropping pattern in the catchment is largely determined by what is grown in field 3 the general decreasing trend of ci can be more clearly seen by computing this indicator for the entire idanha irrigation scheme fig 5 the mean decreasing rate from 2004 was 2 6 year 1 1 2 year 1 in the entire scheme the maximum catchment ci in the irrigation season was 0 81 in the first year of analysis when ci in the rainfed season was 0 23 a value that decreased during 2006 2009 period to recover the initial value after the 2009 10 rainfed seasons table 2 oats and wheat were the main rainfed crops grown during the first part of the study period currently the largest portion of the irrigable area in the catchment is left fallow during the rainfed season except the area reserved for grazing all along the year 3 2 patterns of rainfall irrigation and runoff during the second fortnight of october 2004 there was rainfall of 139 mm the first rainfall event in this period 20 october was of 40 mm producing only 4 4 mm of runoff whereas the last rainfall event 27 october although having almost the same rainfall than the first event 42 mm resulted in much greater runoff 37 mm roc 0 84 at that time the catchment was occupied by mature maize the oak plantation and fallow the hyetograph and hydrograph of these two events exemplified the typical hydrological response of the catchment fig 6 the hydrographs increased shortly after the start of the storms the runoff peak of the first event was 0 23 m3 s 1 fig 6 while the peak of the second hydrograph was 2 56 m3 s 1 fig 6 other examples illustrated how rainfall patterns and soil water content interact in determining the roc during the rainfed season when intense rainfall episodes occurred on fallow ground and after previous precipitation events that had wetted the soil surface roc increased dramatically in contrast if rainfall was evenly distributed without very intense episodes and winter crops covered the ground roc diminished substantially for instance although in the 2005 06 season there was almost twice as much rain than in the preceding season table 3 there were hardly any episodes of intense rainfall and the rain was distributed evenly the soil moisture content was therefore relatively constant and the roc for each of the rainfall events did not vary markedly in the next rainfed season 2006 07 the first major rainfall event occurred between 16 and 27 october only interrupted by one day without rainfall the first period of the event 58 mm of rain generated 0 4 mm of runoff only while the second period 168 mm produced 42 mm of runoff the preceding rainfall provoked this dramatic change in roc from 0 01 to 0 25 in 2007 08 the autumn rainfalls started later than usual despite the significant amount of rain 79 mm during the first relevant events 19 22 november there was little runoff 2 mm however the next significant rain 35 mm during 2 5 january fell on wet or relatively wet soil generating 8 mm of runoff more examples of this behaviour were identified in subsequent rain seasons fig 7 condensed the rainfall runoff response of a set of 38 events selected along the study period considering that they were isolated or relatively isolated thus the pattern of their hyetograph hydrographs could be interpreted more easily as expected runoff increased with rainfall however the slope of the runoff rainfall relationship tended to be greater as the preceding soil moisture here estimated as rainfall during the 10 day precedent period increased fig 7 a multiple linear regression analysis showed that rainfall explained 38 r2 0 38 of the variance of runoff while adding the variable 10 day preceding rainfall it was explained 47 of the variance of runoff r2 0 47 according to the multiple linear regression each mm of rainfall increased runoff by 0 32 mm while each mm of 10 day preceding rainfall increased runoff by 0 12 mm precipitation intensity surely had an important effect also borga and morin 2014 although the location and time resolution of our rainfall data did not allow for verification of this hypothesis regarding the irrigation season runoff was significant in 2004 and 2008 also in 2011 although that year the gauging station was out of service small in 2005 2006 and 2010 and negligible in 2007 2009 and the years 2012 2016 table 3 the seasonal roc did not exceed 0 09 table 4 the daily evolution of irrigation runoff is shown in fig 8 for 2008 one of the three years with most irrigation runoff increased with some oscillations up to a peak in mid august fig 8 mean runoff rate was 0 19 mm day 1 and peak runoff 1 1 mm day 1 the oscillations in runoff observed in 2008 and the other years with significant irrigation were associated with the on off cycles of the centre pivots used in the catchment for irrigation the relationships that determine roc illustrated above may be summarised in terms of the monthly values of mean rainfall irrigation runoff and roc fig 9 the dominant water input in june july and august was from irrigation in those months mean roc was less than 0 10 with the highest value in august may and september were the month when both irrigation and rainfall occurred thus their effects on runoff were mixed october was the month with highest mean rainfall however mean roc 0 16 was less than in any other month in autumn or winter mean roc increased from october into the winter up to 0 48 in february to decreased into the spring fig 9 in april despite mean rainfall being as high as it was in february or march the mean roc decreased to 0 16 indicating that evapotranspiration in that month contributed more to soil drying than it did in previous months 3 3 seasonal water balance and water use indicators mean annual rainfall for the 12 complete water years october 1 through september 30 in the study period 493 mm was below the long term mean of 604 mm 85 years in two of the 12 years 2004 2005 and 2011 2012 rainfall was almost half of the 12 year mean while in one year it was about 35 greater than the mean table 3 the roc in the rainfed season varied between 0 10 and 0 50 table 4 the year 2004 2005 was one of the two years with least rainfall however its roc was 0 36 table 4 estimated deep percolation in the rainfed season exceeded measured runoff in 2 of the 12 monitored seasons table 3 with respect to the irrigation season the irrigation depth applied over the area varied between 26 mm in 2009 and 333 mm in 2004 table 3 irrigation runoff followed irrigation depth and both followed the trend of ci during the irrigation season fig 10 total return flow measured runoff plus estimated deep percolation was also correlated with ci fig 10 the recorded fraction of runoff water was greatest for the two irrigation seasons with greatest irrigation depth viz 2004 and 2008 tables 3 and 4 unfortunately runoff in 2011 was not recorded which could have confirmed or rejected this trend the icuc was only computed for the years in which irrigation was significant 2004 2005 2008 and 2011 with irrigation depth greater than 100 mm when the irrigation depth is relatively shallow the two terms in the numerator of eq 8 have similar magnitudes and the same occurs with the terms in the denominator thus small errors in the water balance used to compute et actual and δs could lead to large errors in icuc icuc was relatively high in the catchment varying between 0 80 in 2004 and 0 90 in 2008 table 4 ris was one or greater than one in the years of more water supply 2004 2008 and 2011 while it was significantly less than one in the interval 0 26 0 79 in the rest of the years table 4 this suggested that reduction of irrigation on the catchment was related not only to ci but also to a shift towards a deficit irrigation strategy this was supported by the estimated deficit coefficient which was less than 0 37 in the later group of irrigation seasons whereas it was greater than 0 54 in the former table 4 although it should be noted that dc computed for irrigation seasons where there was short supply is subject to errors similar to those previously described for icuc the shallow or relatively shallow irrigation depths in the 2006 2010 irrigation seasons except the season of 2008 contrasted with the excess of water during the subsequent rainfed seasons the rws was less than and greater than one in 5 and 7 of the 12 rain seasons respectively table 4 indicating that crop water demand was not matched by water supply in the former and suggesting that the crops could have enough water supply in the latter this was corroborated by the estimated dc which was greater than 0 39 the years with rws less than one 3 4 variability in water usage among fields water usage varied from crop to crop the area weighted mean ris for the study period was 1 04 0 66 0 54 and 0 14 for maize tobacco grass and sorghum respectively apparently maize was the crop for which water deficit was avoided however there was a farm pattern as well the area weighted mean ris for the period of study was 0 86 in the northern farm fields 1 5 in fig 2 and 0 47 in the two southern farms fields 7 18 while maize dominated production in the northern farm 80 of the total area over the study it was seldom grown in the southern farms this could explain crop and farm ris variations in order to understand these differences we interviewed the scheme manager and the catchment farmers and found another factor that could explain ris variations the delivery capacity of the distribution system could be insufficient to satisfy full irrigation demand in mid summer at the two southern farms whereas the reservoir of the northern farm is served by a first order channel branch with a capacity of 650 l s 1 the reservoirs of the two southern farms are located at the tail of a fourth order branch with a capacity of 65 l s 1 at its head this is just about sufficient to deliver the full irrigation requirements of these farms however when seepage losses are subtracted and when control of the channel reservoir network is suboptimal which is normally the case these tail farms could suffer water shortages in some irrigation seasons 4 discussion in 2005 47 of the portuguese rural population was older than 65 years ine 2007 this statistic was representative of the study catchment where two of the four farmers were older than 65 years moreover since 2005 the cap reforms have affected farming activities in the idanha irrigation schemes by discouraging farmers from growing tobacco and other crops formerly of importance in the scheme and also discouraging them from taking new intensification initiatives the combination of social change aging and lack of generational renovation and the cap reform led to changes in patterns of water use in the study catchment we have compared the acreages devoted to different crops in the study catchment and the whole irrigation scheme since 2004 we found that the study catchment was representative of the whole scheme as its allocation to different crops was similar to that of the irrigation scheme the fact that irrigation water is delivered to the farms in the catchment from channel branches of different orders first and fourth further supported the catchment as the unit of analysis representative of the whole scheme in years of low cropping intensity irrigation water usage was reduced as was irrigation return flow and apparently the fraction of return flows the cropping pattern in the study catchment changed drastically from the first to the second irrigation season this trend became even more pronounced in irrigation seasons 2006 and 2007 and was then partially reversed in the 2008 irrigation season due to the international increase in grain prices cropping intensity fluctuated but showed an overall decreasing trend that was evident when examined for the entire idanha irrigation scheme fig 5 an important feature of irrigation performance that distinguishes seasons with high and low usage of irrigation water was evidenced by the ris indicator that took values greater than 1 and smaller than 0 80 in the years with high and low irrigation water use respectively the same pattern was reflected in the irrigation consumptive use coefficient which took values around 0 90 and 0 80 in the low and high water usage years respectively table 4 a value of icuc less than 0 80 is generally found to be characteristic of traditional irrigation schemes whereas values around 0 90 are encountered in modern irrigation schemes or in irrigation schemes with a high level of water re use mateos el al 2000 isidoro et al 2004 causapé 2009 barros et al 2012 the irrigation scheme studied cannot be classified as modern nor does it re use water however the high icuc in years of low ris highlights the fact that icuc depends not only on irrigation system characteristics but also on the applied water depth losada et al 1990 which is something that is frequently overlooked when water plans are being developed for catchments that suffer water deficit several studies have documented changes of irrigation performance indicators with different crops and their disposition in space and time tedeschi et al 2001 calculated an irrigation performance indicator equal to the inverse of ris that varied from crop to crop and over the irrigation season these authors interpreted these variations on the basis of cultivation practices and crop productivity goals similar interpretations of ris variations were presented by lorite et al 2004 who related yield to productivity targets determined by the crop subsidy causapé et al 2004 and goncalves et al 2015 reported variations in an indicator equivalent to the rws that were attributed to the irrigation method flood or sprinkler and or soil differences across the irrigation scheme barros et al 2012 reported changes in the irrigation consumptive use coefficient due to modernisation of the on farm and delivery irrigation systems lozano and mateos 2008 estimated ris variations among the sectors of an irrigation scheme that were relatively small for a given delivery schedule but varied notably between alternative delivery schedules recently benavides et al 2021 have reviewed technical factors determining ris concluding that the characteristics of modern schemes tend to decrease ris while the variations of ris observed by these various authors were driven by environmental agronomic or irrigation system factors the variations of ris and icuc observed in this study were caused mainly by a reduction of cropping intensity in the catchment area which in turn was caused by socio economic changes the hydrological behaviour of an irrigated catchment in a mediterranean climate can be expected to differ markedly between the rainfed season and the irrigation season cid et al 2016 even if the volume of precipitation was the same as the applied irrigation water the highly variable intensity and the frequency of rainfall events are very different from the constant intensity and the regular depth and frequency of irrigation events fig 8 moreover while the soil is bare or sparsely vegetated during the rainfed season the fraction of ground covered by vegetation nearly doubles during the irrigation season the marked climatic seasonality and the stochastic pattern of rainfall of the mediterranean climate make the rainfall runoff relationship particularly complex in this type of environment beven 2002 peña angulo et al 2019 martínez mena et al 2020 for instance the inter seasonal variability of rainfall accounted for the fact that in the second rainfed season of the period of analysis 2005 06 twice as much rain fell as in the previous year however the distribution of rainfall within each season was such that runoff in both years was rather similar table 3 another feature revealed in this study was the dependence of the roc on the preceding rainfall which was consistent with the findings of latron and gallart 2008 they also described based on an exhaustive monitoring of soil moisture and water table depth across a mediterranean catchment different hydrographic patterns which were characteristic of the dry wetting up and wet periods the first rainfed season studied 2004 05 probably represented an extreme situation the small amount of rain that fell during this season produced a roc of 0 36 which contrasted with a roc of 0 10 in another dry rainfed season 2011 12 the latter value was similar to those measured by ceballos and schnabel 1998 in a nearby catchment in years of similar rainfall land use in ceballos and schnabel s catchment was agro silvo pastoral and the size of the catchment was only 35 ha however casalí et al 2008 presented ten year averages for roc of 0 30 and 0 23 in two rainfed agricultural catchments of 207 ha and 169 ha respectively in northern spain these values are similar to the 11 year mean roc of 0 28 obtained at our study catchment in the rain seasons the complexity of the interaction between factors affecting runoff in mediterranean watersheds has been analysed recently by taguas et al 2017 while schoener and stone 2019 have highlighted the difficulties of upscaling small plot observations to watershed scale it appears that the hydrology of the idanha catchment was more affected by rainfall than by irrigation in that regard the concentration of runoff in the autumn which often occurs in this environment has the potential to wash away and erode soil irrespective of whether the cropping system is irrigated or rainfed serpa et al 2015 rodriguez lloveras et al 2016 mediterranean irrigated agriculture is more intensive in terms of the agrochemical applications it receives than rainfed agriculture a fraction of these agrochemicals remains in the irrigated soils after harvest ready to be washed out by the runoff resulting from autumn rainfall in our study the first flush effect obermann et al 2007 was apparent during the intense rainfall events like the event occurred on 27 october 2004 fig 6 and the consequent runoff peak that washed a significant amount of sediment and nitrogen out of the catchment duarte 2011 2017 similar effect was reported by merchán et al 2018 for an irrigated watershed in northern spain monitoring the hydrology of the catchment revealed a number of relationships that are important to document in order to assess the interactions between the eu cap which influences cropping pattern and intensity and water policies such as the eu water framework directive wfd that established the regulations for water usage and conservation in the eu the hydrological station installed at the outlet of the study catchment and the protocol for recording water inputs and outputs both proved to be effective instruments for a water usage monitoring programme in mediterranean environments furthermore the concept of catchment as the monitoring unit is consistent with the principles embedded in the wfd 5 conclusions irrigation water use irrigation return flow and the fraction of irrigation return flows varied notably in the study catchment during the years of monitoring the changes in land use in the catchment led to changes in the irrigated area and in the depth of applied irrigation water the reduction in cropping intensity not only elicited a better performance as judged by the increased irrigation consumptive use coefficient but must have also reduced the environmental impact of irrigation the changes in the irrigation hydrology and in the off site effects of agricultural activities appeared to be due to the effects of agricultural policy reforms rather than to environmental or technical factors the hydrological behaviour of the catchment was quite different in the rainfed and irrigation seasons the runoff coefficient was much greater in the rainfed seasons than in the irrigation seasons in addition the dependence of this coefficient on soil moisture was evidenced in the rainfed seasons while any such dependence was masked during the irrigation seasons by the regular application of water and its constant intensity the eu wfd adopted the catchment as the appropriate water management domain for which precise monitoring is essential hydrological stations such as the one designed and used for the evaluation of a small catchment in this study should become part of a programme for following up the interaction between cap reforms and the implementation and effectiveness of the wfd in the agricultural sector our study supports the recommendation by other authors barros et al 2012 merchán et al 2018 of monitoring the quality of the return flows as part of future research although this research approach does not have a conventional experimental design it is based on thorough quantitative observations of natural events and uncontrolled farming activities natural experiments in their real conditions as the time series is longer the cause effect relationships induced from those observations gain robustness which explains its more and more widespread acceptance in scientific research the recommendation derived from these conclusions is that agricultural policies that affect mediterranean agroecosystems are supported with water accounting that allows evaluating whether the effects of these policies are as expected or not for this purpose hydrological studies in irrigated catchments such as the one proposed here should be generalised declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the

9769,the continuing decline in water availability for agricultural uses and increased energy costs have made it necessary to improve water productivity in crops the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi methodology was developed to maximize the yield of annual crops under water scarce conditions either by reaching a specific deficit target or distributing a limited volume of irrigation water throughout the growing season ordil the objective of this study was for a limited amount of available irrigation water to determine the effect of ordil methodology on yield agronomic and irrigation water productivity and water footprint of a purple garlic cultivar crop under semi arid conditions to this end five irrigation treatments were evaluated from 2015 to 2017 on an

scheduling 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is essential to ensure increasing food production needed to meet the current and future needs of the world population singh and panda 2012 moreover the continuous reduction in the availability of water for agricultural uses due to the priority of other uses including environmental services together with the decrease in resources as a result of global warming and the continued increase in energy costs require improved efficiency in the use of water and energy in agriculture so that it can be a sustainable activity fao 2016 minetur 2015 moreover the population s increasing concern about the environment has triggered the development of indicators able to measure the impact of productive sectors on natural resources the water footprint wf hoekstra et al 2009 determines the amount of water required to produce a certain good or service and may be improved by methodologies able to increase water use efficiency defined as kg of crop production per volume m3 of water received by the crop agronomic water productivity wp fernández et al 2020 worldwide in vegetable cultivation garlic allium sativum l is ranked 14th in dedicated area fao 2016 in spain castilla la mancha clm is the largest producing region with 58 of the national total production magrama 2016 garlic is a crop of great economic and social significance in clm where there is a unique purple garlic cultivar which is promoted under the protected geographical indication ajo morado de las pedroñeras pgiamp fig 1 a protected geographical indication is a quality distinction granted by the european union that links the quality of products to their geographical location the pgiamp consists of approximately 350 000 ha of irrigated land distributed over 26 200 km2 with 5500 ha year 1 dedicated to purple garlic igpamp 2016 fig 1 purple garlic occupies 1 6 of irrigated area in clm and generates an annual income of 75 million euros although the average yield 8990 kg ha 1 is approximately half that of other varieties in clm and spain magrama 2016 in semi arid areas like clm garlic requires irrigation depths of around 310 mm year 1 as with other horticultural crops with high added value and high labor needs in production and post harvest the cultivation of garlic can positively contribute to the local economy of rural areas but needs tools to help in decision making for more efficient use of water and other means of production to make it more sustainable regulated deficit irrigation rdi techniques may allow water productivity to be increased english 1990 this methodology is based on the different sensitivities of crops to water deficit throughout their growth stages thus the effect of water stress on the yield of garlic and other crops is conditioned by both the intensity of the deficit and the stage in which it occurs in addition other parameters such as the size of the fruits bulbs berries grains etc or sugar concentration may be affected anirudh and zora 2012 fabeiro et al 2003 hanson et al 2003 marouelli et al 2002 martín de santa olalla et al 2004 villalobos et al 2004 the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi methodology maximizes the yield of annual crops when the objective is to reach a certain deficit for the whole growing period domínguez et al 2012c or when the amount of available irrigation water is limited and lower than the requirements of the crop ordil leite et al 2015b this methodology was adapted by the model for the economic optimization of irrigation water mopeco ortega et al 2004 which was conceived to optimize the gross margin gm of irrigated farms located in water scarce areas it distributes the available water among the different crops on the farm by establishing the irrigation schedules for each of the crops simulating crop yields by using the equation proposed by stewart et al 1977 mopeco has been calibrated for the main extensive annual crops in clm and other areas of the world carvalho et

methodology under real management conditions for three different limited volumes of available irrigation water and determine its effect on yield agronomic water productivity and water footprint of a garlic crop under the semi arid climatic conditions in clm 2 material and methods 2 1 description of irrigated lands in castilla la mancha agriculture in clm occupies an area of 3 773 029 ha of which 557 851 ha are irrigated lands mapa 2018 mainly with sprinkler and drip irrigation systems the use of irrigation in the area is the result of low average annual precipitation from around 400 mm year 1 and high reference evapotranspiration of over 1100 mm year 1 characterizing the area as semi arid domínguez and de juan 2008 approximately 70 of the irrigable area in clm is located close to groundwater sources given that most surface water resources are used in other bordering regions fig 1 the most common crops in these areas are grapes cereals garlic onion melon watermelon pepper and others such as sunflower potato and alfalfa 2 2 field experiments the field trials were conducted in 2015 2016 and 2017 at the integrated center for vocational training in aguas nuevas longitude 1º 53

at the beginning of the initial growing season 25 soil samples totaling approximately 5 kg were taken from the plot in a zig zag pattern using an auger inclined about 20º sampling depth was 0 4 m were a compacted layer limits the soil depth with no observable horizonation for retrieved samples for this portion of the profile a subsample was analyzed to determine the physicochemical properties soil water retention characteristics were evaluated with undisturbed samples using pressure plate apparatus vanderlinden et al 2003 carducci et al 2012 volumetric water contents were determined for a range

0 372 m3 m 3 and 0 244 m3 m 3 respectively the experimental area of 4730 m2 consisted of four 51 m x 18 m plots fig 2 each year 2 5 m x 18 m subplots with 3 m buffers on either end were laid out with one of the four subdivided plots fig 3 five irrigation treatments were implemented no deficit nd control which was full irrigated according to calculated etc and four with different volumes of available irrigation water corresponding to 100 t100 90 t90 80 t80 and 70 t70 of garlic net irrigation requirements in the weather conditions of the intermediate typical meteorological year domínguez et al 2013 given the few studies in the area the kc values were calibrated for the ajo morado de las pedroñeras variety during 2015 using the water balance in the soil obtained by the soil moisture sensors and validated with the records obtained by a weighing mini lysimeter nicolás cuevas et al 2020 whose effective dimensions were 1 00 0 50 0 40 m installed in the middle of one of the nd treatment subplots during 2016 figs 2 and 3 so the lysimeter was fully integrated into the plot maintaining the same plant density both inside and outside and the distance to the four edges of the plot was 16 5 m and 34 m towards the 18 m border and 8 5 m and 8 5 m towards the 51 m border of the plot all the treatments were randomized with 4 repetitions for t90 t80 t70 and 3 repetitions for t100 and nd fig 3 these last two treatments should be the same under the conditions of intermediate and humid years and only in dry years should they be different at the end of the cropping period when the amount of irrigation water of t100 is depleted the water was applied by a drip irrigation system in which the spacing between drip tape was 0 5 0 5 m the drip lines were located in the middle of the crop rows and it was equipped with pressure compensated drip emitters providing 3 8 l h 1 of nominal discharge an irrigation evaluation was carried out at the beginning of each phenological development stage and the distribution uniformity was 98 on average five high accuracy 2 flowmeters one per treatment were used to monitor the volume of water applied in each irrigation event and for each irrigation treatment level in this experiment the net irrigation water was considered to be the total amount of gross irrigation water supplied by the irrigation system as the drift and evaporation losses may be considered negligible ortíz et al 2009 tarjuelo et al 2000 fertilizer application rates were determined according to the results of the analysis of the soil samples collected at the beginning of the experiment and to the expected yield simulated by mopeco for a typical meteorological year tmy fertilizers were applied twice one as basal in solid form before sowing day and incorporated by tillage which were on january 14 in 2015 and 2016 and on january 16 in 2017 and the second top dressing injected by the drip system during the crop development growth stage table 1 in top dressing each application of fertirrigation was performed 14 days apart by applying about 17 kg n ha 1 per event until the full dose was reached for the calculated requirements of each treatment during the field trials daily irrigation scheduling was performed using the simplified water balance methodology in the root zone allen et al 1998 pereira and allen 1999 which is that used by mopeco domínguez et al 2011 the simulated soil water balance was monitored and compared with the real one provided by the soil moisture sensors until harvest the climatic data were collected from the albacete weather station located at the experimental farm fig 2 which belongs to the national network of the agroclimatic information system for irrigation siar 2018 managed by the spanish ministry of agriculture fishery and food mapa ministerio de agricultura pesca y alimentación in three of the four plot replicates of t90 t80 and t70 and in two of the three plot replicates of nd and t100 we installed sensors for monitoring the soil moisture content during the experiments fig 3 watermark tensiometer sensors at 20 and 40 cm depth and delta t pr2 volumetric soil water sensors at 10 20 30 and 40 cm depth these sensors were placed in representative areas of the experimental plots 20 cm from drip lines and 5 cm from the crop row approximately this experiment was also used to measure different physiological parameters during the cropping season sánchez virosta et al 2020 to determine the yield at harvest two samples of 2 m of plants representative of the plot were harvested from each repetition 2 m x 0 5 m 1 m2 36 samples in total were taken at the two central rows which were not necessarily adjacent after 15 days of drying at outdoor temperature as done in commercial garlic bulbs were weighed and final yields were estimated kg m 2 2 3 soil water balance the daily water balance in the soil simulated by mopeco to determine the irrigation schedules was validated after each irrigation event using the readings of the watermark sensors installed in the subplots fig 3 water potentials measured using the watermark sensors were converted to volumetric soil water content based on water desorption curves developed with disturbed soil samples or intact soil cores at potentials ranging from 33 to 1500 kpa using pressure plate apparatus léllis 2017 1 et c z r θ i θ j z r θ j i

the root growth in 2016 an experimental continuous weighing mini lysimeter figs 3 and 4 was also used to validate the kc values proposed for the area by fabeiro et al 2003 who determined these without performing soil moisture measurements the weights record is carried out by means of 4 load cells located in the corners of the protection frame with a maximum capacity of 150 kg each and a sensitivity

a long period and was adapted by domínguez et al 2013 for forecasting irrigation schedules being used also by other authors martínez romero et al 2019 a tmy consists of 12 months selected from individual years and concatenated to form a complete year with daily values in this study the tmys dry intermediate and wet determined by leite et al 2015a were used which were calculated by using the 1951 2004 climatic series generated by the los llanos weather station located 3 km from the experimental area table 2 pardo et al 2020 tmy daily data and the daily growing degree days gdd determined by the double triangulation method proposed by sevacherian et al 1997 were used in order to predict the duration of garlic growth stages 2 5 optimized regulated deficit irrigation for limited volumes of irrigation water ordil mopeco uses the equation proposed by stewart et al 1977 to estimate crop yield ya as a function of the actual versus maximum evapotranspiration ratio eta etc in the different growth stages the potential yield in the area ym and the crop yield response factor ky by growing stage in the case of garlic vegetative period yield formation and ripening doorenbos and kassam 1979 if the soil water content is higher than the fraction of the total available water taw that a crop can extract without suffering water stress due to water deficit then the crop is considered not to be affected by water deficit conditions and ya will be equal to ym under water deficit conditions eta is calculated according to allen et al 1998 domínguez et al 2011 and ya will be lower than ym 4 y a y

et al 2001 was used to determine the phenological growth stages of garlic daily etc was calculated by multiplying daily crop coefficient kc by daily reference evapotranspiration eto values determined by the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 daily eta under water deficit conditions was calculated using the equation implemented by domínguez et al 2013 with the depletion fraction below which water stress occurs p as a function of et c evaluated using the exponential function of danuso et al 1995 which requires a daily balance of water in the soil domínguez et al 2011 according to danuso et al 1995 the value of p is a daily variable value which depends on the type of crop and the eto p was calculated as 5 p a 1 b e c et c m by using crop group 1 where a 0 85 b 1 585 and c 0 405 the net irrigation requirements of a garlic crop under the tmy intermediate conditions were estimated by using the mopeco model this volume of water was considered as the reference and was assigned to the t100 treatment the three ordil strategies associated with available irrigation water volumes corresponded to 90 t90 80 t80 and 70 t70 of net irrigation requirements t100 in addition one treatment under no deficit conditions nd was implemented the nd and the t100 treatments received the same irrigation schedule up to harvest or until the depletion of the amount of irrigation water available for the t100 treatment in dryer years than the tmy the irrigation schedules of the three ordil treatments followed the methodology established by leite et al 2015b fig 5 in order to maximize yield the methodology determines the deficit in terms of eta etc to be applied to the crop at each ky stage and estimates the amount of irrigation water required to reach that level of deficit using the tmy climatic data and the mopeco simulation model 1st optimization domínguez et al 2013 calibrated the ky values in the area table 3 the maximum difference between eta etc rates of two consecutive ky stages was determined as 0 40 while minimum eta etc rate for ky i was 0 8 in order to avoid nascence and or establishment problems during the kc i stage domínguez et al 2012a 2012b 2013 during the first ky stage the objective is to apply the irrigation schedule that reaches the eta etc objective determined by the methodology for that stage under real management conditions at the end of the first stage the eta etc reached by the crop estimated by mopeco should be similar to the target in the first stage there is enough irrigation water or higher if the climatic conditions and or the soil water availability do not allow that level of deficit to be generated however the amount of irrigation water applied to the crop will likely be different to that forecast by the model consequently after the first ky stage the methodology determines updated eta etc targets for the following ky stages considering the actual remaining irrigation water 2nd optimization the same methodology is followed at the end of each ky stage during the optimizations a portion of irrigation water is saved for the last stage ky iii that determined in the 2nd optimization in order to avoid the early total depletion of irrigation water during ky iii moreover the tmy used may be changed to the wet intermediate or dry series depending on the progression of the climatic conditions in order to better fit the optimizations to the characteristics of the actual year 2 6 agronomic and irrigation water productivity for each irrigation strategy nd t100 t90 t80 and t70 the irrigation water productivity wpi

was analyzed as the sum of the blue wfblue green wfgreen and grey wfgrey components the blue water footprint wfblue refers to consumption of blue water resources surface and groundwater along the supply chain of a product consumption refers to loss of water from the available ground surface water body in a catchment area which happens when water evaporates returns to another catchment area or the sea or is incorporated into a product the green water footprint wfgreen refers to consumption of green water resources rainwater stored in the soil as soil moisture this part of the precipitation eventually evaporates or transpires through plants the grey water footprint wfgrey is an indicator of the degree of freshwater pollution that can be associated with the process and is defined as the volume of fresh water required to assimilate the load of pollutants based on existing ambient water quality standards in agriculture it is calculated as the volume of water that is required to dilute pollutants to such an extent that the quality of the ambient water remains above agreed water quality standards franke et al 2013 hoekstra et al 2009 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 8 wf process wf blue wf

considered significant for 0 01 p 0 05 or highly significant when p 0 01 using the duncan s test westfall and stanley 1993 the standard deviation sd and the coefficient of variation cv were used to analyze the variability of the collected samples within the treatments for the relationship between observed and simulated results the root mean square error rmse and the normalized root mean square error nrmse were performed 3 results and discussion 3 1 phenological monitoring length of growth stages was similar for the three years of the trial table 4 although slightly greater than that proposed by domínguez et al 2013 accumulated gdd for the complete crop cycle by these authors was determined to be pgiamp 2044 137 ºc between 5 and 11 lower than the gdd calculated for the years of the current study table 3 in 2016 the first two stages of kc occurred with a lower accumulation of gdd compared to the values proposed by domínguez et al 2013 and with respect to the observed gdd in 2015 and 2017 the climatic conditions of 2016 probably contributed to these observed results given that the average temperatures were above average for the first stage being above the threshold of optimal temperatures for the development of garlic 18 20 c this caused an advance in the growth of the crop in the early stages as has been observed by other authors del pozo et al 1997 del pozo and gonzález 2005 espagnacq et al 1987 gorini 1977 macêdo et al 2006 pooler and simon 1993 on the other hand the crop cycle was lengthened in the following stages accumulating more gdd compared with the other study years lengthening the growth stage by 9 and 21 days in relation to 2015 and 2017 respectively although 2016 had the lowest amount of precipitation it was also the one in which the crop received the greatest water depth precipitation and irrigation during the last stage which could have contributed to increasing the duration of the phenological stage and prolonging attainment of physiological maturity for the same year no significant differences between treatments were observed on the length of the growth stages this may be because garlic could withstand well the moderate water deficit imposed by ordil and recover physiological normal development denoting that previous water limitation did not produced chronic damage sánchez virosta et al 2020 3 2 soil water balance in 2015 for the climatic conditions of the tmy intermediate table 2 and using the kc coefficients proposed by fabeiro et al 2003 the net growing season irrigation requirements of garlic were established as 3400 m3 ha 1 t100 however at the beginning of the irrigation period the readings of the watermark sensors indicated a higher moisture content than that estimated by the model so it was considered that the kc values were possibly overestimated and that the crop was being over irrigated therefore to achieve a deficit in the ordil treatments the irrigation schedules of the nd treatments were determined using the soil water potential measured with the watermark sensors irrigation was scheduled when the average readings of the sensors located in the soil profile occupied by the roots attained a water potential between 40 and 60 cbar soil water potential typically declined became less negative to approximately 20 cbar after irrigation application i e around 28 mm during the period of higher irrigation requirements in order to follow the ordil methodology as closely as possible in 2015 the irrigation schedules of the deficit treatments were carried out by decreasing a certain percentage the amount of water supplied to nd treatment this percentage was similar to the eta etc objective calculated by ordil for the initial scenario irrigation water availability for t100 3400 m3 ha 1 and kc calibrated by fabeiro et al 2003 by using the soil moisture sensor readings obtained in 2015 for the nd treatment the kc values for garlic were calibrated for that year eq 2 these values were validated in 2016 with the soil moisture readings registered by the sensors installed in the experimental plot and those provided by one continuous weighing mini lysimeter eq 1 fig 6 the final kc values were 0 25 0 95 0 40 table 5 which were obtained after fitting the cloud of points formed by the calculated kc segment curve eq 2 to the classical shape of the kc progression proposed by allen et al 1998 fig 6 although they were obtained under non standard climatic conditions they are lower than those generally recommended by fao 0 70 1 00 0 70 and those used in previous works in the area 0 40 1 00 0 60 fabeiro et al 2003 table 3 where kc adjusted based on sensors data line was obtained after fitting the cloud of points formed by the calculated kc values to the classical shape of the kc progression by using the average values of the soil moisture sensors and the lysimeter readings although strictly speaking the climatic and management conditions were not the same other authors ayars 2008 bryla et al 2010 villalobos et al 2004 pereira et al 2021 proposed as maximum kc values those ranging from 1 00 to 1 20 in semi arid areas of california usa and córdoba spain although the values in table 5 are lower than those proposed by fao under standard climatic conditions 0 40 and 0 70 for initial and final stages respectively allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2021 bryla et al 2010 also stated low values in late season 0 16 so pereira et al 2021 indicated that discrepancies in the kc values at the end season of certain crops as garlic may be caused by the crop management the crop cultivar and environmental conditions prior to harvesting which influence on the duration of senescence the lower values determined in this study may have been partially affected by the irrigation system used drip irrigation and not sprinkling by reducing the evaporative fraction of eto especially in the stages of establishment and vegetative development in any event the values obtained are better adjusted to the test conditions than to the values indicated by fao for garlic by using the proposed kc values table 5 mopeco simulated the evolution of the water content in the soil similarly to the values estimated by the watermark sensors as an example fig 7 shows these values for the nd treatment in 2016 the watermark sensors were installed on julian day 26 12 days after planting and during the first days they marked high water contents values since they were installed saturating the soil in contact with them in the following days the soil water contents using sensor measurements based on mopeco simulations exhibited the same trend and showed similar values on day 150 due to a fault in the pumping system it was not possible to irrigate for a week and the crop was stressed due to water deficit as shown by both representations of soil moisture as the available water line of the soil is below 1 p which indicates that the fraction of total available water taw had been exhausted so theoretically the crop entered into stress due to water deficit allen et al 1998 one week before the harvest irrigation was terminated to facilitate the drying of the bulbs which is reflected in the decrease in soil moisture at the end of the cycle 3 3 management of irrigation water for the climatic conditions of the tmy intermediate table 2 and using the crop parameters in table 3 and corrected kc values table 5 the calculated reference net seasonal irrigation requirements of garlic t100 were 2750 m3 ha 1 this value was used to calculate the amount of irrigation water available for the ordil strategies t90 2475 m3 ha 1 t80 2200 m3 ha 1 and t70 1925 m3 ha 1 in 2016 and 2017 table 6 for the three study years accumulated eto at the end of the growing season was greater than that corresponding to tmy intermediate between 10 and 15 fig 8 this outcome was also observed by pardo et al 2020 during the same years for barley the accumulated rainfall in 2017 was slightly 5 greater than that approximated by the tmy intermediate nevertheless accumulated precipitation between 71 and 73 julian days in 2017 was 58 mm which resulted in the deep percolation of a considerable proportion of the rainfall that could not be used by the crop 41 mm in the nd treatment according to the simulations of mopeco on the other hand cumulative precipitation in 2015 and 2016 was lower than the tmy intermediate projections starting with the middle of the growing cycle in 2015 and for the entire growing season in 2016 which was the driest year with a 21 less rainfall compared with tmy intermediate projections consequently the weather conditioned the eta etc objectives for each stage as well as the amount of irrigation water applied at each ky stage the three experimental years were adverse in terms of irrigation water requirements because initially the climatology was similar 2015 and 2016 or even better 2017 than the reference conditions tmy intermediate but the three seasons progressed to drier than normal conditions table 7 therefore the crop was under a greater water deficit than projected in all the treatments during the final growth stage except for nd fig 9 and was therefore considerably complex with regards to the application of the ordil methodology as a consequence irrigation requirements of garlic nd were greater compared with that projected for a tmy intermediate year 14 2 33 4 and 47 2 for 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively nonetheless the methodology allowed the limited volumes of water to be managed and reduced the effects of adverse weather conditions by redistributing the irrigation water for the most sensitive stages the methodology assumed a theoretical optimal distribution of deficit at the beginning of the irrigation season according to the projected precipitation and eto and the available irrigation water fig 9 the ordil methodology suggests maintaining stage ky ii with the least possible water deficit fig 9 since this is the bulbification stage in which the greatest impact on yield occurs under a water deficit stress table 3 consequently the most restrictive target eta etc values corresponded to vegetative development ky i and ripening ky iii this distribution of the water deficit proposed by ordil takes into account the different sensitivities to water deficit during the growth stages and corresponds to the recommendations published by other authors domínguez et al 2013 fabeiro et al 2003 lipinski and gaviola 2011 sadaria et al 1997 the deficit objectives proposed for each treatment conditioned the irrigation schedules applied only in 2015 were the nd and t100 treatments the same so the global for the whole growth cycle eta etc ratio that is the ratio over the complete crop cycle was 0 90 in both treatments fig 9 by applying 3 less of the total water planned for irrigation at the end of the season table 8 for the other treatments in 2015 the total water applied was between 17 and 19 lower than the projected volume as reference consumption table 6 in 2016 and 2017 this was partially caused by a failure in the pumping system and by the need to readjust the kc values in order to avoid over watering in 2016 and 2017 scheduling irrigation using the known kc table 5 the final applied volume ranged between 0 and 5 higher than that projected using the intermediate tmy depending on the treatment and year considered table 8 therefore the ordil methodology was able to accommodate the planned irrigation scheduling for the volume of available water in each treatment however slight adjustments in proposed irrigation applications were necessary to account for small deviations between planned and applied irrigation based on measured volumes with the flowmeters although the volumes of irrigation applied in each treatment were similar in 2016 and 2017 the global eta etc ratios actually achieved differed between 2 and 5 from 0 85 to 0 90 from 0 85 to 0 88 from 0 79 to 0 83 and from 0 74 to 0 76 in the eta etc relationships for treatments t100 t90 t80 and t70 respectively fig 9 so the weather conditions and especially the distribution of rainfall determined different levels of stress due to water deficit with equal irrigation volumes applying similar volumes of irrigation water the weather conditions caused the t100 treatments to be deficient in the three years so that in general the target eta etc values proposed by the model at the beginning of the cycle were greater than those actually attained it is also important to note that even under unfavorable weather conditions the model reserved an amount of water for the last stage of crop development fig 9 leite et al 2015b this highlights the potential of this methodology when managing limited volumes of water even under adverse weather conditions so as not to cause high water deficits at any stage of the crop exceeding in all cases the minimum value of eta etc 0 5 considered for this methodology allen et al 1998 domínguez et al 2013 although the model favors water application in the most sensitive crop stages the distribution of the irrigation varies according to the years table 8 thus stage ky ii the one with the greatest water requirements villalobos et al 2004 received the greatest amount of irrigation water between 60 and 80 of the total in deficit treatments with increasing percentages with lower water availability being approximately 50 in the nd treatments while during the establishment stage ky i it was unnecessary to apply irrigation in years 2015 and 2017 table 8 fig 9 the total water applied in the treatments with no deficit was between 450 and 480 mm similar to the values recorded by fabeiro et al 2003 with 490 mm hanson et al 2003 applied 430 450 mm of seasonal irrigation for garlic in a semi arid area of california usa with total rainfall less than 23 mm from establishment to harvest they observed significant yield differences between treatments receiving lower applied irrigation levels 3 4 effect of ordil on yield as expected the yield was reduced by decreasing the supply of irrigation water applied to each treatment normally with significant differences between treatments within the same year table 9 in all years the highest yields were achieved in the no deficit treatments and in 2016 it was significantly different from t100 t70 treatments achieved the lowest yields with no significant differences compared with the t80 in 2015 the maximum amount of irrigation water set for a tmy intermediate year was not achieved due to a failure in the pumping system between days 138 and 145 after sowing so the maximum global eta etc was 0 90 fig 9 and table 9 in 2016 which was predominantly a dry growing season table 7 the water assigned for t100 was not sufficient to cover the real needs during the year eta etc 0 88 thus causing water stress which was more noticeable in the later growth stages consequently significantly lower yield was observed for the nd treatment eta etc 0 98 and that achieved in the previous year in t100 eta etc 0 90 t80 treatments eta etc 0 76 0 82 and t70 eta etc 0 69 0 76 showed no significant differences between each other within each year although the mean yields were always greater for t80 table 9 although the global eta etc ratios were relatively similar for the same treatments in the different years the yields were statistically different in most cases table 9 this was especially noticeable in 2017 when in all treatments the yields were statistically lower than the rest of the equivalent treatments in 2015 and 2016 initially 2017 was characterized as tmy wet with high precipitation table 7 fig 8 but the climatic conditions during the cycle changed to tmy dry in addition during the crop development cycle temperatures were higher than usual causing early development of the aerial part consequently the performance of all the treatments in this year was negatively affected by the climatic characteristics in 2017 performance in the nd t100 and t90 treatments fell approximately 30 compared to the same treatments in the years 2015 and 2016 while in t80 and t70 the loss of yields reached 42 this is an example of how the year on year yield in horticultural crops such as garlic can be strongly influenced by climatic conditions in addition to hydric conditions in the same experiment sánchez virosta et al 2020 in 2017 found different correlations on physiology parameters such as net assimilation rates and stomatal conductance with higher temperatures when vapour pressure deficit vpd and mean temperature impacted negatively on stomatal conductance values gs unlike the 2016 year the effect of the increase in temperature and long photoperiods favors in general the growth of the garlic bulb however if the temperatures are very high during its development above 25 ºc bulb size decreases and consequently causes a lower production considering that the increase in temperatures shortens the ripening stage it can have a negative effect on growth wu et al 2014 in addition for garlic night temperatures during the rest of the growing stages including the storage of the garlic clove for planting could affect the yield wu et al 2016b 2016a for the same limited volume of water an influence of the climatic conditions of each year fig 8 on the yields was expected eta etc ratios indicates differences table 9 which indicates that the yields may be different for the same treatment in 2015 and 2016 for which maximum yields were similar the differences between ranges in yield might be related to the global eta etc ratios in 2015 a 7 reduction in total water applied t90 vs t80 involved yield losses of 4 0 34 t ha 1 and a decrease in global eta etc of 0 79 0 76 the same reduction in total water applied between treatments t70 and t80 involved yield losses of 2 0 10 t ha 1 with a more noticeable difference in the global eta etc ratio de 0 76 a 0 69 table 9 the results in 2016 were similar an 8 reduction in total water applied t90 vs t80 involved yield losses of 7 0 67 t ha 1 and a decrease in global eta etc of 0 06 0 85 0 79 for t70 and t80 the yield losses were as in 2015 of 2 0 67 t ha 1 with 11 less total water applied and global eta etc ratios that fell from 0 79 to 0 75 on the other hand in 2017 both the percentage losses of yield 9 and 3 when comparing the treatments t90 vs t80 and t80 vs t70 and the percentage reductions of total water supplied 7 and 8 when comparing the treatments t90 vs t80 and t80 vs t70 were similar to those observed in the previous two years but the total yields were lower than those obtained in 2015 and 2016 in 2017 eta etc ratios for each treatment were similar or slightly higher than the previous two years so the crop was no longer stressed due to water deficit in addition the total amounts of water received by the crop in each of the treatments were greater compared with 2015 and 2016 between 15 and 22 for deficit treatments and between 11 and 7 for t100 respectively this is likely a result of weather conditions in 2017 since although the precipitation recorded was high it was poorly distributed and therefore less effective since 91 was recorded in the early stages of development table 8 fig 7 in test fields average yields in 2015 and 2016 were slightly higher than the average for the area 9 0 t ha 1 corroborating a general loss of performance in the area in 2017 magrama 2016 coopaman 2017 these results show that this crop is sensitive to high temperatures at least during the early stages of development the potential yield of 11 2 t ha 1 proposed by fabeiro et al 2003 and used by domínguez et al 2013 to calibrate ky coefficients was not attained in any of the years reaching a maximum in 2016 at 10 2 t ha 1 the potential yield of other garlic varieties is thus greater hanson et al 2003 reported a yield of 19 2 t ha 1 with the white garlic variety california early applying an irrigation volume of 363 mm with a constant deficit of eta etc 0 8 during all growth stages however according to the results of hanson et al 2003 similar reductions in the eta etc ratios to those studied in the present work with respect to the nd treatments likewise caused comparable reductions in yield the yields obtained in the present work were slightly lower than those obtained by lipinski and gaviola 2011 in a purple garlic cultivar lican inta and clearly lower in two white garlic cultivars snow inta and unión between 10 800 and 17 150 kg ha 1 these works were carried out in the san carlos region mendoza argentina with plant densities 30 greater than those of the present work on the other hand yield responses reported by marouelli et al 2002 diverged from the above reported results of the other authors for an irrigation depth of 323 mm which corresponds to 80 of the net irrigation requirements of the crop and using constant regulated deficit irrigation techniques throughout the crop cycle they observed a 63 reduction in yield compared to the treatments with no deficit in the present study for similar deficits the yields fell by a maximum of 35 year 2017 for the most restrictive treatment t70 the yield declines with respect to nd were 15 20 and 25 in 2015 2016 y 2017 respectively the reduction in water applied for these years was 27 35 and 29 and the reduction in global eta etc ratios was 21 19 and 24 respectively these results show that the ordil methodology limited the yield declines despite the different internal weather conditions this result coincides with those obtained by other authors in the management of regulated deficit irrigation for this and other crops hanson et al 2003 domínguez et al 2012a forey et al 2016 martín de santa olalla et al 2004 phogat et al 2017 3 5 effect of ordil on agronomic and irrigation water productivity both agronomic wp and irrigation wpi water productivity was greatly influenced by yields eqs 6 and 7 because water volumes were similar across years thus wp was lowest in 2017 compared with other years table 9 in all years wp was increased by reducing the applied water normally showing significant differences between treatments with this being more marked in the wpi in this sense and in this same experiment sánchez virosta et al 2020 found a higher intrinsic water use efficiency ratio between net co2 assimilation and leaf stomatal conductance in higher deficit treatments and mainly in yield formation stage in t70 wp increased by 5 in 2017 and 20 on average in 2015 and 2016 relative to nd for these same treatments wpi increased 26 in 2017 and 44 on average in 2015 and 2016 except for the year 2017 with adverse and atypical climatic conditions for the development of the crop and in semi arid climates such as that of the test area the stress conditions due to water deficit increased the wp and especially wpi with an increase of 26 in 2017 and 44 on average in 2015 and 2016 between extreme treatments table 9 in the same area for barley pardo et al 2020 obtained slightly lower increases 32 and 10 in the irrigation and wp respectively in areas with a semi arid climate where the main limiting yield factor is water available for irrigation the increase in wp would allow a higher total yield for the entire farm if the same amount of irrigation water was applied to a larger cultivable area when possible i e if part of the farm is not irrigated due to insufficient irrigation water which could generate a higher income for the farmer however because input costs for garlic production are high it would be necessary to carry out an economic analysis to check whether this option is profitable in addition several quality factors affecting final prices obtained by farmers size and color of the bulbs e g may be negatively affected by deficit irrigation for several crops under rdi techniques similar trends have been observed whereby wp increases with increasing water deficits when the methodology takes into account the sensitivity of the yield to the deficit at different stages of development 1 8 2 5 kg m 3 for garlic mandefro and shoeb 2015 fabeiro et al 2003 from 2 2 to 3 4 kg m 3 for maize domínguez et al 2012a from 2 1 to 2 7 kg m 3 for carrot carvalho et al 2014 léllis et al 2017 although in other crops with very high yields the values are clearly higher varying from 10 4 to 12 0 kg m 3 for onion domínguez et al 2012b from 5 0 to 12 0 kg m 3 for melon leite et al 2015a and from 17 to 40 from 23 to 32 from 24 to 39 and from 35 to 53 kg m 3 for four different potato varieties martínez romero et al 2019 3 6 effect of ordil on the water footprint the lower the availability of irrigation water the greater was the value of the green water footprint wfgreen table 10 after each irrigation event high deficit treatments recharged a lower percentage of taw than nd or low deficit treatments therefore in the case of abundant precipitation the percentage of rainwater retained in the root zone increased and reduced or avoided percolation this is an advantage of the ordil methodology thus wfgreen depends on the local climate and weather conditions mainly precipitation depth and its seasonal distribution and the water storage capacity of the soil wfgreen varied between 84 and 185 m3 mg 1 across all treatments with the lowest and greatest values observed for the nd and t70 treatments respectively these results are consistent with those obtained for barley during the same years and in the same field by pardo et al 2020 who obtained increases in wfgreen between 50 and 80 in this study increases in wfgreen for garlic varied between approximately 28 and 120 which is possibly explained by the distribution of rainfall as discussed earlier mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 indicated that in humid climate areas wfgreen of garlic may reach values of up to 337 m3 mg 1 such a high green water footprint could not be achieved for semi arid conditions and shallow soils characteristic of this study area therefore the comparison of this indicator across areas with different climatology must be performed with caution fernández et al 2020 pardo et al 2020 however it can be useful to compare the environmental impact on water of different treatments carried out in the same area or in areas with similar characteristics as expected wfblue decreased with wp being greater in the nd treatments and in the drier years table 8 in addition for a rainier year 2015 wfblue was lower than for a drier one 2016 in the case of deficit treatments although it may be strongly influenced by the distribution of rainfall and percolation thus in 2017 these values were considerably greater due to the concentration of rain in a few days in march that was ineffective in elevating yield that year mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 determined an average worldwide value of 81 m3 mg 1 for garlic which is clearly lower than that obtained in this study as in the case of wfgreen climate greatly influences the magnitude of wfblue because in areas where rainfall supplies all or the major part of the water requirements of the crop this indicator should tend to zero wfblue is directly related to the carbon footprint in those cases where pressurized irrigation systems require conventional energy as in most of the irrigated lands in clm and other semi arid areas consequently reducing this indicator implies a lower impact of irrigated agriculture on global warming pardo et al 2020 the main feature of wfgrey is reducing the concentration of dissolved nitrogen in the percolated water in the optimized treatments t70 t80 and t90 the indicator decreased with deficit table 10 thus ordil together with a suitable fertilization based on the expected yield lower for more deficit treatments allowed this value to be lowered broadly speaking t100 treatments reached the highest values since the nitrogenous fertilization was the same as in the nd treatment but the final yield was lower the values for this treatment were 60 lower than those established by mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 average 170 m3 mg 1 finally the estimated total water footprint of the process wfprocess ranged between approximately 350 m3 mg 1 and 475 m3 mg 1 being the smallest for the deficit treatments these values are lower than those estimated by mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 589 m3 mg 1 due to the dependence of wfgreen on the magnitude of precipitation in 2017 wfprocess with values ranging between 631 and 655 m3 mg 1 was considerably greater compared with the other years because of the relatively lower yields combined with poorly distributed precipitation in that year in this sense the ordil methodology allows the impact of the water footprint in the environment to be reduced by increasing both the effectiveness of precipitation use and wp and by decreasing the percolation losses and the corresponding risks of contamination of groundwater resources this finding could represent a commercial advantage in the future if consumers and markets set a value on the sustainability of agricultural practices 4 conclusions for shallow soils and in areas where standard lysimetric stations are not available mini lysimeters may be a suitable option for measuring a good approximation of crop evapotranspiration and determining relatively accurate kc coefficients for herbaceous crops such as garlic moreover a lower manufacturing and installation price its smaller size offers a higher versatility and portability although the nd treatment achieved the highest yields and t70 the lowest average 19 yield loss the application of the ordil methodology permitted the attainment of increased irrigation water productivity with t70 being the treatment achieving the greatest wp average 38 and 15 higher than nd for wpi and wp respectively thus from the environmental point of view application of the ordil methodology resulted in a decrease in the water footprint by up to 30 t70 and increased the use of green water up to 120 nevertheless an economic analysis is required to analyze if ordil would be advisable in terms of profitability consequently this study demonstrates ordil can be used under real management conditions of a garlic crop when the availability of water is limited and lower than the crop water requirements combining this methodology with models such as mopeco may help farmers improve the efficiency of resource use and reduce the impact on the environment under water scarce conditions declaration of competing

9769,the continuing decline in water availability for agricultural uses and increased energy costs have made it necessary to improve water productivity in crops the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi methodology was developed to maximize the yield of annual crops under water scarce conditions either by reaching a specific deficit target or distributing a limited volume of irrigation water throughout the growing season ordil the objective of this study was for a limited amount of available irrigation water to determine the effect of ordil methodology on yield agronomic and irrigation water productivity and water footprint of a purple garlic cultivar crop under semi arid conditions to this end five irrigation treatments were evaluated from 2015 to 2017 on an

scheduling 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is essential to ensure increasing food production needed to meet the current and future needs of the world population singh and panda 2012 moreover the continuous reduction in the availability of water for agricultural uses due to the priority of other uses including environmental services together with the decrease in resources as a result of global warming and the continued increase in energy costs require improved efficiency in the use of water and energy in agriculture so that it can be a sustainable activity fao 2016 minetur 2015 moreover the

unique purple garlic cultivar which is promoted under the protected geographical indication ajo morado de las pedroñeras pgiamp fig 1 a protected geographical indication is a quality distinction granted by the european union that links the quality of products to their geographical location the pgiamp consists of approximately 350 000 ha of irrigated land distributed over 26 200 km2 with 5500

approximately half that of other varieties in clm and spain magrama 2016 in semi arid areas like clm garlic requires irrigation depths of around 310 mm year 1 as with other horticultural crops with high added value and high labor needs in production and post harvest the cultivation of garlic can positively contribute to the local economy of rural areas but needs tools to help in decision making for more efficient use of water and other means of production to make it more sustainable regulated deficit irrigation rdi techniques may allow water productivity to be increased english 1990 this methodology is based on the different sensitivities of crops to water deficit throughout their growth stages thus the effect of water stress on the yield of garlic and other crops is conditioned by both the intensity of the deficit and the stage in which it occurs in addition other parameters such as the size of the fruits bulbs berries grains etc or sugar concentration may be affected anirudh and zora 2012 fabeiro et al 2003 hanson et al 2003 marouelli et al 2002 martín de santa olalla et al 2004 villalobos et al 2004 the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi methodology maximizes the yield of annual crops when the objective is to reach a certain deficit for the whole growing period domínguez et al 2012c or when the amount of available irrigation water is limited and lower than the requirements of the crop ordil leite et al 2015b this methodology was adapted by the model for the economic optimization of irrigation water mopeco ortega et al 2004 which was conceived to optimize the gross margin gm of irrigated farms located in water scarce areas it distributes the available water among the different crops on the farm by establishing the irrigation schedules for each of the crops simulating crop yields by using the equation proposed by stewart et al 1977 mopeco has been calibrated for the main extensive annual crops in clm and other areas of the world carvalho et

development stage and the distribution uniformity was 98 on average five high accuracy 2 flowmeters one per treatment were used to monitor the volume of water applied in each irrigation event and for each irrigation treatment level in this experiment the net irrigation water was considered to be the total amount of gross irrigation water supplied by the irrigation system as the drift and evaporation losses may be considered negligible ortíz et al 2009 tarjuelo et al 2000 fertilizer application rates were determined according to the results of the analysis of the soil samples collected

a long period and was adapted by domínguez et al 2013 for forecasting irrigation schedules being used also by other authors martínez romero et al 2019 a tmy consists of 12 months selected from individual years and concatenated to form a complete year with daily values in this study the tmys dry intermediate and wet determined by leite et al 2015a were used which were calculated by using the 1951 2004 climatic series generated by the los llanos weather station located 3 km from the experimental area table 2 pardo et al 2020 tmy daily data and the daily growing degree days gdd determined by the double triangulation method proposed by sevacherian et al 1997 were used in order to predict the duration of garlic growth stages 2 5 optimized regulated deficit irrigation for limited volumes

the net irrigation requirements of a garlic crop under the tmy intermediate conditions were estimated by using the mopeco model this volume of water was considered as the reference and was assigned to the t100 treatment the three ordil strategies associated with available irrigation water volumes corresponded to 90 t90 80 t80 and 70 t70 of net irrigation requirements t100 in addition one treatment under no deficit conditions nd was implemented the nd and the t100 treatments received the same irrigation schedule up to harvest or until the depletion of the amount of irrigation water available for the t100 treatment in dryer years than the tmy the irrigation schedules of the three ordil treatments followed the methodology established by leite et al 2015b fig 5 in order to maximize yield the methodology determines the deficit in terms of eta etc to be applied to the crop at each ky stage and estimates the amount of irrigation water required to reach that level of deficit using the tmy climatic data and the mopeco simulation model 1st optimization domínguez et al 2013 calibrated the ky values in the area table 3 the maximum difference between eta etc rates of two consecutive ky stages was determined as 0 40 while minimum eta etc rate for ky i was 0 8 in order to avoid nascence and or establishment problems during the kc i stage domínguez et al 2012a 2012b 2013 during the first ky stage the objective is to apply the irrigation schedule that reaches the eta etc objective determined by the methodology for that stage under real management conditions at the end of the first stage the eta etc reached by the crop estimated by mopeco should be similar to the target in the first stage there is enough irrigation water or higher if the climatic conditions and or the soil water availability do not allow that level of deficit to be generated however the amount of irrigation water applied to the crop will likely be different to that forecast by the model consequently after the first ky stage the methodology determines updated eta etc targets for the following ky stages considering the actual remaining irrigation water 2nd optimization the same methodology is followed at the end of each ky stage during the optimizations a portion of irrigation water is saved for the last stage ky iii that determined in the 2nd optimization in order to avoid the early total depletion of irrigation water during ky iii moreover the tmy used may be changed to the wet intermediate or dry series depending on the progression of the climatic conditions in order to better fit the optimizations to the characteristics of the actual year 2 6 agronomic and irrigation water productivity for each irrigation strategy nd t100 t90 t80 and t70 the irrigation water productivity wpi

was analyzed as the sum of the blue wfblue green wfgreen and grey wfgrey components the blue water footprint wfblue refers to consumption of blue water resources surface and groundwater along the supply chain of a product consumption refers to loss of water from the available ground surface water body in a catchment area which happens when water evaporates returns to another catchment area or the sea or is incorporated into a product the green water footprint wfgreen refers to consumption of green water resources rainwater stored in the soil as soil moisture this part of the precipitation eventually evaporates or transpires through plants the grey water footprint wfgrey is an indicator of the degree of freshwater pollution that can be associated with the process and is defined as the volume of fresh water required to assimilate the load of pollutants based on existing ambient water quality standards in agriculture it is calculated as the volume of water that is required to dilute

considered significant for 0 01 p 0 05 or highly significant when p 0 01 using the duncan s test westfall and stanley 1993 the standard deviation sd and the coefficient of variation cv were used to analyze the variability of the collected samples within the treatments for the relationship between observed and simulated results the root mean square error rmse and the normalized root mean square error nrmse were performed 3 results and discussion 3 1 phenological monitoring length of growth stages was similar for the three years of the trial table 4 although slightly greater than that proposed by domínguez et al 2013 accumulated gdd for the complete crop cycle by these authors was determined to be pgiamp 2044 137 ºc between 5 and 11 lower than the gdd calculated for the years of the current study table 3 in 2016 the first two stages of kc occurred with a lower accumulation of gdd compared to the values proposed by domínguez et al 2013 and with respect to the observed gdd in 2015 and 2017 the climatic conditions of 2016 probably contributed to these observed results given that the average temperatures were above average for the first stage being above the threshold of optimal temperatures for the development of garlic 18 20 c this caused an advance in the growth of the crop in the early stages as has been observed by other authors del pozo et al 1997 del pozo and gonzález 2005 espagnacq et al 1987 gorini 1977 macêdo et al 2006 pooler and simon 1993 on the other hand the crop cycle was lengthened in the following stages accumulating more gdd compared with the other study years lengthening the growth stage by 9 and 21 days in relation to 2015 and 2017 respectively although 2016 had the lowest amount of precipitation it was also the one in which the crop received the greatest water depth precipitation and irrigation during the last stage which could have contributed to increasing the duration of the phenological stage and prolonging attainment of physiological maturity for the same year no significant differences between treatments were observed on the length of the growth stages this may be because garlic could withstand well the moderate water deficit imposed by ordil and recover physiological normal development denoting that previous water limitation did not produced chronic damage sánchez virosta et al 2020 3 2 soil water balance in 2015 for the climatic conditions of the tmy intermediate table 2 and using the kc coefficients proposed by fabeiro et al 2003 the net growing season irrigation requirements of garlic were established as 3400 m3 ha 1 t100 however at the beginning of the irrigation period the readings of the watermark sensors indicated a higher moisture content than that estimated by the model so it was considered that the kc values were possibly overestimated and that the crop was being over irrigated therefore to achieve a deficit in the ordil treatments the irrigation schedules of the nd treatments were determined using the soil water potential measured with the watermark sensors irrigation was scheduled when the average readings of the sensors located in the soil profile occupied by the roots attained a water potential between 40 and 60 cbar soil water potential typically declined became less negative to approximately 20 cbar after irrigation application i e around 28 mm during the period of higher irrigation requirements in order to follow the ordil methodology as closely as possible in 2015 the irrigation schedules of the deficit treatments were carried out by decreasing a certain percentage the amount of water supplied to nd treatment this percentage was similar to the eta etc objective calculated by ordil for the initial scenario irrigation water availability for t100 3400 m3 ha 1 and kc calibrated by fabeiro et al 2003 by using the soil moisture sensor readings obtained in 2015 for the nd treatment the kc values for garlic were calibrated for that year eq 2 these values were validated in 2016 with the soil moisture readings registered by the sensors installed in the experimental plot and those provided by one continuous weighing mini lysimeter eq 1 fig 6 the final kc values were 0 25 0 95 0 40 table 5 which were obtained after fitting the cloud of points formed by the calculated kc segment curve eq 2 to the classical shape of the kc progression proposed by allen et al 1998 fig 6 although they were obtained under non standard climatic conditions they are lower than those generally recommended by fao 0 70 1 00 0 70 and those used in previous works in the area 0 40 1 00 0 60 fabeiro et al 2003 table 3 where kc adjusted based on sensors data line was obtained after fitting the cloud of points formed by the calculated kc values to the classical shape of the kc progression by using the average values of the soil moisture sensors and the lysimeter readings although strictly speaking the climatic and management conditions were not the same other authors ayars 2008 bryla et al 2010 villalobos et al 2004 pereira et al 2021 proposed as maximum kc values those ranging from 1 00 to 1 20 in semi arid areas of california usa and córdoba spain although the values in table 5 are lower than those proposed by fao under standard climatic conditions 0 40 and 0 70 for initial and final stages respectively allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2021 bryla et al 2010 also stated low values in late season 0 16 so pereira et al 2021 indicated that discrepancies in the kc values at the end season of certain crops as garlic may be caused by the crop management the crop cultivar and environmental conditions prior to harvesting which influence on the duration of senescence the lower values determined in this study may have been partially affected by the irrigation system used drip irrigation and not sprinkling by reducing the evaporative fraction of eto especially in the stages of establishment and vegetative development in any event the values obtained are better adjusted to the test conditions than to the values indicated by fao for garlic by using the proposed kc values table 5 mopeco simulated the evolution of the water content in the soil similarly to the values estimated by the watermark sensors as an example fig 7 shows these values for the nd treatment in 2016 the watermark sensors were installed on julian day 26 12 days after planting and during the first days they marked high water contents values since they were installed saturating the soil in contact with them in the following days the soil water contents using sensor measurements based on mopeco simulations exhibited the same trend and showed similar values on day 150 due to a fault in the pumping system it was not possible to irrigate for a week and the crop was stressed due to water deficit as shown by both representations of soil moisture as the available water line of the soil is below 1 p which indicates that the fraction of total available water taw had been exhausted so theoretically the crop entered into stress due to water deficit allen et al 1998 one week before the harvest irrigation was terminated to facilitate the drying of the bulbs which is reflected in the decrease in soil moisture at the end of the cycle 3 3 management of irrigation water for the climatic conditions of the tmy intermediate table 2 and using the crop parameters in table 3 and corrected kc values table 5 the calculated reference net seasonal irrigation requirements of garlic t100 were 2750 m3 ha 1 this value was used to calculate the amount of irrigation water available for the ordil strategies t90 2475 m3 ha 1 t80 2200 m3 ha 1 and t70 1925 m3 ha 1 in 2016 and 2017 table 6 for the three study years accumulated eto at the end of the growing season was greater than that corresponding to tmy intermediate between 10 and 15 fig 8 this outcome was also observed by pardo et al 2020 during the same years for barley the accumulated rainfall in 2017 was slightly 5 greater than that approximated by the tmy intermediate nevertheless accumulated precipitation between 71 and 73 julian days in 2017 was 58 mm which resulted in the deep percolation of a considerable proportion of the rainfall that could not be used by the crop 41 mm in the nd treatment according to the simulations of mopeco on the other hand cumulative precipitation in 2015 and 2016 was lower than the tmy intermediate projections starting with the middle of the growing cycle in 2015 and for the entire growing season in 2016 which was the driest year with a 21 less rainfall compared with tmy intermediate projections consequently the weather conditioned the eta etc objectives for each stage as well as the amount of irrigation water applied at each ky stage the three experimental years were adverse in terms of irrigation water requirements because initially the climatology was similar 2015 and 2016 or even better 2017 than the reference conditions tmy intermediate but the three seasons progressed to drier than normal conditions table 7 therefore the crop was under a greater water deficit than projected in all the treatments during the final growth stage except for nd fig 9 and was therefore considerably complex with regards to the application of the ordil methodology as a consequence irrigation requirements of garlic nd were greater compared with that projected for a tmy intermediate year 14 2 33 4 and 47 2 for 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively nonetheless the methodology allowed the limited volumes of water to be managed and reduced the effects of adverse weather conditions by redistributing the irrigation water for the most sensitive stages the methodology assumed a theoretical optimal distribution of deficit at the beginning of the irrigation season according to the projected precipitation and eto and the available irrigation water fig 9 the ordil methodology suggests maintaining stage ky ii with the least possible water deficit fig 9 since this is the bulbification stage in which the greatest impact on yield occurs under a water deficit stress table 3 consequently the most restrictive target eta etc values corresponded to vegetative development ky i and ripening ky iii this distribution of the water deficit proposed by ordil takes into account the different sensitivities to water deficit during the growth stages and corresponds to the recommendations published by other authors domínguez et al 2013 fabeiro et al 2003 lipinski and gaviola 2011 sadaria et al 1997 the deficit objectives proposed for each treatment conditioned the irrigation schedules applied only in 2015 were the nd and t100 treatments the same so the global for the whole growth cycle eta etc ratio that is the ratio over the complete crop cycle was 0 90 in both treatments fig 9 by applying 3 less of the total water planned for irrigation at the end of the season table 8 for the other treatments in 2015 the total water applied was between 17 and 19 lower than the projected volume as reference consumption table 6 in 2016 and 2017 this was partially caused by a failure in the pumping system and by the need to readjust the kc values in order to avoid over watering in 2016 and 2017 scheduling irrigation using the known kc table 5 the final applied volume ranged between 0 and 5 higher than that projected using the intermediate tmy depending on the treatment and year considered table 8 therefore the ordil methodology was able to accommodate the planned irrigation scheduling for the volume of available water in each treatment however slight adjustments in proposed irrigation applications were necessary to account for small deviations between planned and applied irrigation based on measured volumes with the flowmeters although the volumes of irrigation applied in each treatment were similar in 2016 and 2017 the global eta etc ratios actually achieved differed between 2 and 5 from 0 85 to 0 90 from 0 85 to 0 88 from 0 79 to 0 83 and from 0 74 to 0 76 in the eta etc relationships for treatments t100 t90 t80 and t70 respectively fig 9 so the weather conditions and especially the distribution of rainfall determined different levels of stress due to water deficit with equal irrigation volumes applying similar volumes of irrigation water the weather conditions caused the t100 treatments to be deficient in the three years so that in general the target eta etc values proposed by the model at the beginning of the cycle were greater than those actually attained it is also important to note that even under unfavorable weather conditions the model reserved an amount of water for the last stage of crop development fig 9 leite et al 2015b this highlights the potential of this methodology when managing limited volumes of water even under adverse weather conditions so as not to cause high water deficits at any stage of the crop exceeding in all cases the minimum value of eta etc 0 5 considered for this methodology allen et al 1998 domínguez et al 2013 although the model favors water application in the most sensitive crop stages the distribution of the irrigation varies according to the years table 8 thus stage ky ii the one with the greatest water requirements villalobos et al 2004 received the greatest amount of irrigation water between 60 and 80 of the total in deficit treatments with increasing percentages with lower water availability being approximately 50 in the nd treatments while during the establishment stage ky i it was unnecessary to apply irrigation in years 2015 and 2017 table 8 fig 9 the total water applied in the treatments with no deficit was between 450 and 480 mm similar to the values recorded by fabeiro et al 2003 with 490 mm hanson et al 2003 applied 430 450 mm of seasonal irrigation for garlic in a semi arid area of california usa with total rainfall less than 23 mm from establishment to harvest they observed significant yield differences between treatments receiving lower applied irrigation levels 3 4 effect of ordil on yield as expected the yield was reduced by decreasing the supply of irrigation water applied to each treatment normally with significant differences between treatments within the same year table 9 in all years the highest yields were achieved in the no deficit treatments and in 2016 it was significantly different from t100 t70 treatments achieved the lowest yields with no significant differences compared with the t80 in 2015 the maximum amount of irrigation water set for a tmy intermediate year was not achieved due to a failure in the pumping system between days 138 and 145 after sowing so the maximum global eta etc was 0 90 fig 9 and table 9 in 2016 which was predominantly a dry growing season table 7 the water assigned for t100 was not sufficient to cover the real needs during the year eta etc 0 88 thus causing water stress which was more noticeable in the later growth stages consequently significantly lower yield was observed for the nd treatment eta etc 0 98 and that achieved in the previous year in t100 eta etc 0 90 t80 treatments eta etc 0 76 0 82 and t70 eta etc 0 69 0 76 showed no significant differences between each other within each year although the mean yields were always greater for t80 table 9 although the global eta etc ratios were relatively similar for the same treatments in the different years the yields were statistically different in most cases table 9 this was especially noticeable in 2017 when in all treatments the yields were statistically lower than the rest of the equivalent treatments in 2015 and 2016 initially 2017 was characterized as tmy wet with high precipitation table 7 fig 8 but the climatic conditions during the cycle changed to tmy dry in addition during the crop development cycle temperatures were higher than usual causing early development of the aerial part consequently the performance of all the treatments in this year was negatively affected by the climatic characteristics in 2017 performance in the nd t100 and t90 treatments fell approximately 30 compared to the same treatments in the years 2015 and 2016 while in t80 and t70 the loss of yields reached 42 this is an example of how the year on year yield in horticultural crops such as garlic can be strongly influenced by climatic conditions in addition to hydric conditions in the same experiment sánchez virosta et al 2020 in 2017 found different correlations on physiology parameters such as net assimilation rates and stomatal conductance with higher temperatures when vapour pressure deficit vpd and mean temperature impacted negatively on stomatal conductance values gs unlike the 2016 year the effect of the increase in temperature and long photoperiods favors in general the growth of the garlic bulb however if the temperatures are very high during its development above 25 ºc bulb size decreases and consequently causes a lower production considering that the increase in temperatures shortens the ripening stage it can have a negative effect on growth wu et al 2014 in addition for garlic night temperatures during the rest of the growing stages including the storage of the garlic clove for planting could affect the yield wu et al 2016b 2016a for the same limited volume of water an influence of the climatic conditions of each year fig 8 on the yields was expected eta etc ratios indicates differences table 9 which indicates that the yields may be different for the same treatment in 2015 and 2016 for which maximum yields were similar the differences between ranges in yield might be related to the global eta etc ratios in 2015 a 7 reduction in total water applied t90 vs t80 involved yield losses of 4 0 34 t ha 1 and a decrease in global eta etc of 0 79 0 76 the same reduction in total water applied between treatments t70 and t80 involved yield losses of 2 0 10 t ha 1 with a more noticeable difference in the global eta etc ratio de 0 76 a 0 69 table 9 the results in 2016 were similar an 8 reduction in total water applied t90 vs t80 involved yield losses of 7 0 67 t ha 1 and a decrease in global eta etc of 0 06 0 85 0 79 for t70 and t80 the yield losses were as in 2015 of 2 0 67 t ha 1 with 11 less total water applied and global eta etc ratios that fell from 0 79 to 0 75 on the other hand in 2017 both the percentage losses of yield 9 and 3 when comparing the treatments t90 vs t80 and t80 vs t70 and the percentage reductions of total water supplied 7 and 8 when comparing the treatments t90 vs t80 and t80 vs t70 were similar to those observed in the previous two years but the total yields were lower than those obtained in 2015 and 2016 in 2017 eta etc ratios for each treatment were similar or slightly higher than the previous two years so the crop was no longer stressed due to water deficit in addition the total amounts of water received by the crop in each of the treatments were greater compared with 2015 and 2016 between 15 and 22 for deficit treatments and between 11 and 7 for t100 respectively this is likely a result of weather conditions in 2017 since although the precipitation recorded was high it was poorly distributed and therefore less effective since 91 was recorded in the early stages of development table 8 fig 7 in test fields average yields in 2015 and 2016 were slightly higher than the average for the area 9 0 t ha 1 corroborating a general loss of performance in the area in 2017 magrama 2016 coopaman 2017 these results show that this crop is sensitive to high temperatures at least during the early stages of development the potential yield of 11 2 t ha 1 proposed by fabeiro et al 2003 and used by domínguez et al 2013 to calibrate ky coefficients was not attained in any of the years reaching a maximum in 2016 at 10 2 t ha 1 the potential yield of other garlic varieties is thus greater hanson et al 2003 reported a yield of 19 2 t ha 1 with the white garlic variety california early applying an irrigation volume of 363 mm with a constant deficit of eta etc 0 8 during all growth stages however according to the results of hanson et al 2003 similar reductions in the eta etc ratios to those studied in the present work with respect to the nd treatments likewise caused comparable reductions in yield the yields obtained in the present work were slightly lower than those obtained by lipinski and gaviola 2011 in a purple garlic cultivar lican inta and clearly lower in two white garlic cultivars snow inta and unión between 10 800 and 17 150 kg ha 1 these works were carried out in the san carlos region mendoza argentina with plant densities 30 greater than those of the present work on the other hand yield responses reported by marouelli et al 2002 diverged from the above reported results of the other authors for an irrigation depth of 323 mm which corresponds to 80 of the net irrigation requirements of the crop and using constant regulated deficit irrigation techniques throughout the crop cycle they observed a 63 reduction in yield compared to the treatments with no deficit in the present study for similar deficits the yields fell by a maximum of 35 year 2017 for the most restrictive treatment t70 the yield declines with respect to nd were 15 20 and 25 in 2015 2016 y 2017 respectively the reduction in water applied for these years was 27 35 and 29 and the reduction in global eta etc ratios was 21 19 and 24 respectively these results show that the ordil methodology limited the yield declines despite the different internal weather conditions this result coincides with those obtained by other authors in the management of regulated deficit irrigation for this and other crops hanson et al 2003 domínguez et al 2012a forey et al 2016 martín de santa olalla et al 2004 phogat et al 2017 3 5 effect of ordil on agronomic and irrigation water productivity both agronomic wp and irrigation wpi water productivity was greatly influenced by yields eqs 6 and 7 because water volumes were similar across years thus wp was lowest in 2017 compared with other years table 9 in all years wp was increased by reducing the applied water normally showing significant differences between treatments with this being more marked in the wpi in this sense and in this same experiment sánchez virosta et al 2020 found a higher intrinsic water use efficiency ratio between net co2 assimilation and leaf stomatal conductance in higher deficit treatments and mainly in yield formation stage in t70 wp increased by 5 in 2017 and 20 on average in 2015 and 2016 relative to nd for these same treatments wpi increased 26 in 2017 and 44 on average in 2015 and 2016 except for the year 2017 with adverse and atypical climatic conditions for the development of the crop and in semi arid climates such as that of the test area the stress conditions due to water deficit increased the wp and especially wpi with an increase of 26 in 2017 and 44 on average in 2015 and 2016 between extreme treatments table 9 in the same area for barley pardo et al 2020 obtained slightly lower increases 32 and 10 in the irrigation and wp respectively in areas with a semi arid climate where the main limiting yield factor is water available for irrigation the increase in wp would allow a higher total yield for the entire farm if the same amount of irrigation water was applied to a larger cultivable area when possible i e if part of the farm is not irrigated due to insufficient irrigation water which could generate a higher income for the farmer however because input costs for garlic production are high it would be necessary to carry out an economic analysis to check whether this option is profitable in addition several quality factors affecting final prices obtained by farmers size and color of the bulbs e g may be negatively affected by deficit irrigation for several crops under rdi techniques similar trends have been observed whereby wp increases with increasing water deficits when the methodology takes into account the sensitivity of the yield to the deficit at different stages of development 1 8 2 5 kg m 3 for garlic mandefro and shoeb 2015 fabeiro et al 2003 from 2 2 to 3 4 kg m 3 for maize domínguez et al 2012a from 2 1 to 2 7 kg m 3 for carrot carvalho et al 2014 léllis et al 2017 although in other crops with very high yields the values are clearly higher varying from 10 4 to 12 0 kg m 3 for onion domínguez et al 2012b from 5 0 to 12 0 kg m 3 for melon leite et al 2015a and from 17 to 40 from 23 to 32 from 24 to 39 and from 35 to 53 kg m 3 for four different potato varieties martínez romero et al 2019 3 6 effect of ordil on the water footprint the lower the availability of irrigation water the greater was the value of the green water footprint wfgreen table 10 after each irrigation event high deficit treatments recharged a lower percentage of taw than nd or low deficit treatments therefore in the case of abundant precipitation the percentage of rainwater retained in the root zone increased and reduced or avoided percolation this is an advantage of the ordil methodology thus wfgreen depends on the local climate and weather conditions mainly precipitation depth and its seasonal distribution and the water storage capacity of the soil wfgreen varied between 84 and 185 m3 mg 1 across all treatments with the lowest and greatest values observed for the nd and t70 treatments respectively these results are consistent with those obtained for barley during the same years and in the same field by pardo et al 2020 who obtained increases in wfgreen between 50 and 80 in this study increases in wfgreen for garlic varied between approximately 28 and 120 which is possibly explained by the distribution of rainfall as discussed earlier mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 indicated that in humid climate areas wfgreen of garlic may reach values of up to 337 m3 mg 1 such a high green water footprint could not be achieved for semi arid conditions and shallow soils characteristic of this study area therefore the comparison of this indicator across areas with different climatology must be performed with caution fernández et al 2020 pardo et al 2020 however it can be useful to compare the environmental impact on water of different treatments carried out in the same area or in areas with similar characteristics as expected wfblue decreased with wp being greater in the nd treatments and in the drier years table 8 in addition for a rainier year 2015 wfblue was lower than for a drier one 2016 in the case of deficit treatments although it may be strongly influenced by the distribution of rainfall and percolation thus in 2017 these values were considerably greater due to the concentration of rain in a few days in march that was ineffective in elevating yield that year mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 determined an average worldwide value of 81 m3 mg 1 for garlic which is clearly lower than that obtained in this study as in the case of wfgreen climate greatly influences the magnitude of wfblue because in areas where rainfall supplies all or the major part of the water requirements of the crop this indicator should tend to zero wfblue is directly related to the carbon footprint in those cases where pressurized irrigation systems require conventional energy as in most of the irrigated lands in clm and other semi arid areas consequently reducing this indicator implies a lower impact of irrigated agriculture on global warming pardo et al 2020 the main feature of wfgrey is reducing the concentration of dissolved nitrogen in the percolated water in the optimized treatments t70 t80 and t90 the indicator decreased with deficit table 10 thus ordil together with a suitable fertilization based on the expected yield lower for more deficit treatments allowed this value to be lowered broadly speaking t100 treatments reached the highest values since the nitrogenous fertilization was the same as in the nd treatment but the final yield was lower the values for this treatment were 60 lower than those established by mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 average 170 m3 mg 1 finally the estimated total water footprint of the process wfprocess ranged between approximately 350 m3 mg 1 and 475 m3 mg 1 being the smallest for the deficit treatments these values are lower than those estimated by mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 589 m3 mg 1 due to the dependence of wfgreen on the magnitude of precipitation in 2017 wfprocess with values ranging between 631 and 655 m3 mg 1 was considerably greater compared with the other years because of the relatively lower yields combined with poorly distributed precipitation in that year in this sense the ordil methodology allows the impact of the water footprint in the environment to be reduced by increasing both the effectiveness of precipitation use and wp and by decreasing the percolation losses and the corresponding risks of contamination of groundwater resources this finding could represent a commercial advantage in the future if consumers and markets set a value on the sustainability of agricultural practices 4 conclusions for shallow soils and in areas where standard lysimetric stations are not available mini lysimeters may be a suitable option for measuring a good approximation of crop evapotranspiration and determining relatively accurate kc coefficients for herbaceous crops such as garlic moreover a lower manufacturing and installation price its smaller size offers a higher versatility and portability although the nd treatment achieved the highest yields and t70 the lowest average 19 yield loss the application of the ordil methodology permitted the attainment of increased irrigation water productivity with t70 being the treatment achieving the greatest wp average 38 and 15 higher than nd for wpi and wp respectively thus from the environmental point of view application of the ordil methodology resulted in a decrease in the water footprint by up to 30 t70 and increased the use of green water up to 120 nevertheless an economic analysis is required to analyze if ordil would be advisable in terms of profitability consequently this study demonstrates ordil can be used under real management conditions of a garlic crop when the availability of water is limited and lower than the crop water requirements combining this methodology with models such as mopeco may help farmers improve the efficiency of resource use and reduce the impact on the environment under water scarce conditions declaration of competing
