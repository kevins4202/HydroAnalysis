10365,actual and potential evapotranspiration et are important variables for regional and global environmental modelling these elements provide better understanding and management of the hydrological cycle particularly in relation to several environmental stresses affecting ecosystems with the advancement of airborne techniques remote sensing approaches have enabled an accurate estimation of crop actual et with limited field visits in this study an enhanced version i e m sebali of the improved surface energy balance model for land surnamed sebali will be presented main improvements concern the retrieval of 10 m et values using sentinel 2 images and modis terra lst 1 km datasets the other enhancement considers the usage of monthly only climatic datasets instead of the required hourly daily and monthly data in sebali calibrations and validations were made in china belgium germany lebanon and italy between 2013 and 2017 yielding adequate rsme i e 20 06 mm month and ame i e 15 69 mm month values these countries represent four different climatic regions i e continental semi arid monsoon influenced warm summer humid continental mediterranean hot summer and oceanic climates thus landast 8 thermal bands will be unnecessary to implement sebali also the conversion between hourly and daily climatic data and monthly climatic datasets in sebali showed a pearson value of 93 3 thus seven of the required inputs in sebali were eliminated in m sebali saving on time and resources furthermore the wheat seasonal trend is produced in the bekaa valley lebanon between november 2018 and july 2019 showing an average et value of 620 mm in a region with 510 mm of precipitations during the same period two peaks were visible in january and may signaling the different wheat phenological stages the importance of m sebali lies in providing an automated retrieval of 10 m et biomass production and water productivity wp among other variables in diverse climatic regions such improvements shall improve the assessment of et and wp towards better management of water resources particularly in regions lacking some required inputs keywords sebali modis water productivity china developing country farm scale 1 introduction evapotranspiration et rates are a key factor in assessing water needs and demands nasrallah et al 2019 2020 establishing an et system that can accurately estimate water consumption is particularly pivotal to increase our understanding of the crop water productivity while conserving water resources for our future generations mhawej et al 2020a such system should benefit from the advancement of the airborne technologies mainly in the areas of remote sensing techniques promising saving on time personal and resources faour et al 2018 ghoussein et al 2018 furthermore with the migration towards cloud computing tchernykh et al 2019 these et systems should be more user oriented and widely applicable in any region across the globe when retrieved et rates could be included with water influxes such as precipitation and groundwater amounts to conduct a comprehensive water accounting for a specific basin karimi et al 2013 several previous surface energy balance seb models studies were proposed based on satellite images and remote sensing techniques such as the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a b the mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution using internalized calibration metric allen et al 2005 2007 the surface energy balance index sebi menenti and choudhury 1993 the surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 and the et watch wu et al 2008 in these approaches et is considered as a residual of the surface energy balance liou and kar 2014 validations of these systems showed an annual fluctuation between 5 36 in comparison to flux towers et values mhawej et al 2020b their main used satellite sensors include modis avhrr gimms landsat with the latter having the best spatial resolution of 30 m still limitations exist when implementing any of these seb models particularly related to the large number of the required inputs mhawej et al 2020a b in this context an improved et model surnamed surface energy balance algorithm for land improved sebali was proposed in 2020 bridging the gaps between the previously available models main enhancements of sebali concern a reduced number of required inputs a more adequate automated and dynamic selection of hot cold pixels over agricultural areas the usage of atmospherically corrected i e bottom of atmosphere satellite images and the usage of water stress ws factor as a surrogate to the vapor pressure deficit vpd and the soil related datasets a detailed description of sebali is found in mhawej et al 2020a b furthermore the highest spatial resolution et value produced to our knowledge is based on the landsat satellites with a 30 m spatial resolution more precisely none of the previous studies was able to accurately produce 10 m et outputs using for instance sentinel 2 satellite images even though the latter was launched nearly five years ago sentinel 2 has his advantages over using landsat 8 satellite images in terms of better spatial spectral and temporal resolutions more precisely a study conducted by battude et al 2016 has tried to tackle the usage of sentinel 2 satellite by proposing a robust and generic method in maize fields using sentinel 2 like remote sensing data this study paved the road towards using sentinel 2 datasets in et related studies even though it falls short when extrapolated spatially temporally and to other crops type sadeghi et al 2017 has proposed the widely acknowledged trapezoid model using both setinel 2 and landsat 8 images while the latter approach proved its limitations to accurately predict et values the main concern would be to merge data fusion on both spatial and temporal contexts between these two types of data as discussed by mandanici and bitelli 2016 and zhang et al 2018 in others researches e g sharma and tare 2018 vanino et al 2018 mokhtari et al 2019 authors have tried to implement several seb models including a combination of sentinel 2 and landsat 8 satellites still one of the proposed approaches i e vanino et al 2018 appeared to be biased and unreliable as discussed in bonafoni et al 2020 thus this paper will present an enhancement over the previously proposed sebali model surnamed monthly sebali or m sebali these improvements concern the requirement of monthly climatic datasets only as well as retrieving 10 m et rates without the need of landat 8 thermal bands these enhancements will enable professional and non specialist particularly in developing countries to asses et with a limited number of factors and in an automated manner while sebali et rates based on landsat 8 was validated in diverse climatic regions mhawej et al 2020a b and in different countries e g united states germany netherlands italy a validation for the 30 m landsat 8 et values based on monthly datasets is carried out in four countries i e china belgium germany and italy with three different climates i e with monsoon influenced warm summer humid continental mediterranean hot summer and oceanic climates m sebali was calibrated and validated as well in two agricultural lands in china and in lebanon with monsoon influenced warm summer humid continental and continental semi arid respectively furthermore wheat seasonal et trend for the season 2018 2019 was produced in the bekaa valley lebanon based on the newly proposed m sebali with 10 m et outputs finally a map for the whole region is generated followed by further assessments and discussions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area in lebanon concerns the bekaa plain or valley fig 1 perched between two mountainous ranges and consisting of three natural units the mount lebanon mountains the valley unit and the anti lebanon mountains the average altitude is 1050 m a s l and could extend to 1200 m a s l the prevailing climate is continental semi arid with an average annual precipitation of 592 mm a variety of rock formations including sand sandy clay loam silty clay loam and loam exist within the bekaa valley allaw et al 2015 agriculture is the main economic activity in the plain with the cereal parcels predominate the region during winter season mhawej et al 2020a in this context wheat parcels were selected based on reporting from local farmers several field visits and satellite images they are usually sowed in november with a development stage ending in late june still different cropping patterns exist within the region including fallow early potato late potato wheat and wheat fallow wheat alfalfa orchard and vineyard are also cultivated within the plain eddy covariance et datasets for landsat 8 validations were provided from four different countries including belgium germany china and italy fig 2 the flux towers were established in cultivated lands such as cereals root crops leguminous crops oil crops vegetables vineyards and tobacco the selection of these locations was based only on the existent of an agricultural land beneath these towers thus to include different countries with diverse climatic regions for a better validation process other cultivations type available in the region correspond to weeded crops olives groves and other annual crops furthermore complex cultivation patterns dominate these regions according to the koppen classification belgium and germany prevail an oceanic climate with the coldest month averaging above 0 c the mean annual temperature is around 22 c italy has a prevailing mediterranean hot summer climate with usually hot and dry summers elevations at flux towers sites range between 0 and 478 m mean annual temperatures fluctuate between 7 6 c and 15 6 c and mean annual precipitation between 421 and 842 mm the study area used for sentinel 2 validations in china concerns the donghuayuan town huailai county hebei province located at the guating reservoir fig 2 the average altitude is 700 m a s l with a soil type typically clay and sandy with an average annual precipitation around 525 mm and an abundant sunshine zone this region provides an adequate environment for vineyards plantation shi et al 2016 still at the province scale the total cultivated lands represent one third of the total hebei province area of 188 800 km2 corn plantations account for nearly half of the total cropland based on the national census in 2016 cotton plantations could be seen as well in the province 2 2 data background 2 2 1 satellite data landsat 8 provides 30 meter spatial resolution images a revisit time of 16 day and two infrared bands at 100 m i e bands 10 and 11 level 1 or top of atmosphere toa and level 2 or bottom of atmosphere boa images exist the processed landsat 8 level 2 datasets correspond to atmospherically corrected satellite images generated from the land surface reflectance code lasrc data used in this study corresponds to boa landsat 8 which could be acquired from usgs official website i e https earthexplorer usgs gov it is important to note that because of the low temporal resolution of the landast 8 in only very limited cases more than two satellite images could be seen in a specific month on the other hand sentinel 2 offers 10 m 20 m and 60 m spatial resolution 13 bands with a revisit time of five days when considering both sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b satellites multiple levels of processing exist in sentinel 2 products while the level 0 is the raw image data the level 1c is a radio corrected and geo refined product obtained from processing and refining the input level 1a toa radiance data however the level 2a of sentinel 2 is similar to level 2 landsat 8 including scene classifications and atmospheric corrections thus datasets of level 2a were downloaded from the official europe s copernicus website and used in this study the land surface temperature lst product derived from modis sensor satellite images also known as mod11 for terra and myd11 for aqua is available through the distributed active archive center daac of the national snow and ice data center nsidc i e https earthdata nasa gov since september 2000 the mod11 is calculated at 1 km pixels by the generalized split window algorithm and at 6 km grids by the day night algorithm the end products include daytime and nighttime lsts quality assessment observation time view angles and emissivity in this study the 1 km modis lst day was used along its quality assessment band it is important to note that landsat 8 sentinel 2 and modis lst could be assessed and fetched from the google earth engine gee at https code earthengine google com this latter combines a multi petabyte catalog of satellite images and geospatial datasets assisting researchers and planners to monitor changes and map trends on the earth s surface in this study the used remote sensing datasets were downloaded from gee using a specialized script that calculates the monthly median of all available images in each of the landsat 8 boa sr sentinel 2 level 2a and modis lst datasets following a cloud removal process annex i 2 2 2 ground data with the effort of many scientists and technicians around the world the fluxnet2015 dataset were established from multiple regional flux networks at more than 200 different sites between 1991 and 2014 the fluxnet2015 dataset includes several data quality control protocols and a data processing pipeline more precisely close interaction with tower teams were made to improve data quality novel methods for uncertainty quantification use of reanalysis data to fill long gaps of meteorological variable records among others in this study eddy covariance et datasets were used to validate landsat 8 et values generated from monthly data only they were downloaded from the official data portal of the fluxnet community available at https fluxnet fluxdata org three main regions were considered based on the availability of ground based et tower datasets after 2013 coinciding with the launch of landsat 8 these regions correspond to belgium 4 74623e 50 55162 n with data between march and october 2014 germany 13 52238e 50 89306 n with data between august and october 2014 and italy 12 02656e 42 38041 n 12 02604e 42 37722 n 12 0222e 42 38 n having data between september 2013 and december 2014 the missing months correspond to missing values from the measured ground based et or missing landsat 8 images due to bad weather conditions data doi for each site is available in table 1 ground et for sentinel 2 validations were collected from an eddy covariance located in donghuayuan town china at 115 7880e 40 3491 n between january 2016 and december 2017 the acquisition frequency of the vortex correlator is 10 hz with an altitude of 5 m the direction of the ultrasound is true north with a distance between the ultrasonic anemometer csat3 and the co2 h2o analyzer li7500a of 15 cm outputs are 30 minute data obtained by post processing using eddypro software the post processing includes outlier value elimination delay time correction coordinate rotation frequency response correction ultrasound virtual temperature and density correction this was done through the following steps 1 identifying when the instrument is providing erroneous data with a huge sudden change between two consecutive measurements 2 showing the data before and after one hour of precipitation 3 highlighting raw data with a missing rate greater than 10 within the 30 min data 4 and finally excluding the observation data of weak turbulence at night which is usually less than 0 1 m s furthermore the quality of each flux value is evaluated through the atmospheric and turbulence stability tests the quality labels for sensible heat latent heat and carbon dioxide flux are divided into three levels of quality for further assessments climatic data such as temperature relative humidity wind speed and incoming solar radiation for the selected regions were retrieved from their corresponding flux towers as for lebanon a nearby weather station located in tal amara riyak 33 8613231e 35 9879912 n were used to provide the needed climatic factors for sebali in the years of 2018 and 2019 2 3 sebali background sebali is the newest iteration of the widely acknowledged sebal model proposed since the 90 s still the implementation of the sebal model or its main iteration metric model requires a set of factors generally lacking in many countries around the globe moreover remote sensing inputs required in such models were not updated along the huge improvements in satellite images particularly considering the higher spatial and temporal resolutions currently available for instance toa landsat images are used with a transformation from digital number dn to radiance that does not particularly fit the newly available landsat 8 then while atmospheric biases found in toa datasets might affect final et outputs the usage of erroneous transformation as found in the sebal open source python script or py sebal is deriving questionable et values in many locations particularly in the bekaa valley of lebanon this was found as well through the processing of the readily available landast 8 sebal et values found in the fao water productivity open access portal wapor accessible at wapor apps fao org more precisely many wheat fields registered seasonal et values of 200 mm within a region of 500 mm of precipitation in this context sebali was proposed using improvements found in the previous surface energy balance models among many other unrelated models such enhancements enabled the reduction of the required factors to implement sebali but more importantly to be updated with the relatively new landsat 8 images thus sebali has eliminated the needs of instantaneous relative humidity saturated soil moisture content saturated soil moisture content in the subsoil residual soil moisture content field capacity wilting point as discussed in mhawej et al 2020a and replace many of them by the water stress approach this latter was well welcomed in the literature particularly because soil moisture is difficult to be characterized over large areas from either modeling or remote sensing on the other hand vapor pressure deficit vpd controlling the moisture availability on plant photosynthesis changes tremendously over heterogeneous landscapes rendering any linear relation between vpd and soil water availability very difficult to be achieved mhawej et al 2020a the water stress equation used in many previous studies as discussed in mhawej et al 2020a is as follows 1 w s l e l e h where le is the latent heat flux in w m 2 corresponding to the instantaneous et and h is sensible heat flux in w m 2 this equation is based in the fact that the decreasing amount of energy partitioned into latent heat flux suggests a stronger moisture limitation thus the usage of this factor has enabled the assessment of seasonal and annual et and biomass production in lebanon where soil related data are missing mhawej et al 2020a b furthermore sebali has included the selection of the hot cold pixel approach proposed by the metric model where only agricultural pixels could be considered such addition has provided a better internal calibration of the model mhawej et al 2020a still sebali has added its own two step calibration method based on the existent local or regional water bodies the hypothesis was that water bodies were treated as cold pixels where the sensible heat is minimum transpiration is null and the evapotranspiration is maximum mhawej et al 2020b thus the sensible heat flux over water bodies is calculated and then compared to the generated mean h values over the whole region the highest value is selected the second step of the calibration concerns the comparison between the latent heat flux of water and then compared to the generated mean et values the final et values is then adjusted accordingly mhawej et al 2020b furthermore the calibration value has been automated as well through the usage of the fao irrigation and drainage paper no 24 pan coefficient value as discussed in mhawej et al 2020b it is important to note that these improvements are processed in an automated manner saving on time and resources lastly surface reflectance sr boa atmospherically corrected landsat 8 images were incorporated the quality assessment qa band was included as well for cloud detection and removal even though the implementation of sebali generated an r squared value of 88 4 compared to many flux towers in different countries with diverse climates mhawej et al 2020a b sebali requires diverse inputs as satellite climatic and anchor datasets are needed to implement the model detailed in fig 3 3 methods the proposed monthly sebali i e m sebali model in this manuscript aimed 1 to reduce the number of inputs over the sebali model as well as 2 to retrieve 10 m et values using sentinel 2 images to our knowledge none of these two improvements were previously found in the literature 3 1 reduce the number of inputs reducing the number of climatic inputs has begun by assessing the feasibility of eliminating the need of instantaneous and daily at satellite overpass climatic data which could be lacking in some regions but more importantly to reduce efforts and time the hypothesis here is that as sebali is providing et values at monthly scale the usage of monthly only datasets might also be adequate this is encouraged by the existence of multiple internal and dynamic calibrations in sebali model thus instantaneous at satellite overpass temperature wind speed and transmissivity and daily at satellite overpass temperature relative humidity wind speed and transmissivity were excluded the followed approach was straightforward more particularly a comparison between monthly et outputs produced under the standard sebali and m sebali with monthly only inputs was made the used datasets concerned monthly et values between august 2017 and june 2018 with nearly 4800 pixels over agricultural areas in the bekaa valley lebanon the selection of this region is related to our possession of highly accurate crop database in those selected pixels and thus to reduce inherited biases the objective was to retrieve a relationship between standard sebali et and m sebali et values which have further assisted in reducing the needed climatic data in m sebali and applying the retrieved relation instead in lebanon and other studied countries as well more particularly a high correlation was found between the et values of the two models i e sebali and m sebali over those 4800 pixels the retrieved relation equation was then applied to m sebali et values using landsat 8 boa datasets over belgium germany china and italy with monthly only climatic datasets root mean square error rmse and absolut mean error ame were calculated between the generated m sebali et values and the existent eddy covariance flux towers et values between 2013 and 2017 3 2 retrieve sentinel 2 10 m et values in order to improve the spatial resolution of sebali sentinel 2 10 m images coupled with modis lst 1 km satellite data were tested using both the standard sebali and m sebali with monthly only climatic datasets the usage of modis lst product is crucial as sentinel 2 satellite alone does not provide much needed thermal bands for the calculation of lst and later the evapotranspiration rates on the other hand when landsat 8 30 m satellite data are used thermal bands exist in bands 10 and 11 anyhow the usage of modis lst 1 km data was possible due to the actual usage of the lst in many surface energy balance models e g sebali sebal metric which is primarily for the identification of hot and cold pixels a misguided conception exists in that matter proclaiming that lst data are crucial to provide indirect information on the vegetation hydric conditions at pixel level actually the spatial resolution of the lst used is these type of models does not affect the final et outputs particularly if the concerned lst pixel size is less than the available agricultural lands this is due to the fact that the assessment of hot cold pixels is aimed to propose a linear equation that would derive the relation between air temperatures at two different heights this relation is then used to calculate the much needed dt factor for the assessment of the sensible heat flux furthermore in seb models such as sebali and metric the selection of hot cold pixels is based as well on the agricultural surface not only lst which is usually of higher spatial resolution of lst as modis datasets were used for the retrieval of lst sentinel 2 datasets are used for the assessment of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and albedo as found in faour et al 2015 2016 2018 modis lst data were selected as they provide daily information that could coincide with the overpass time of sentinel 2 moreover this product provides lst ready information as well as a quality assessment band generally missing when retrieving lst from landsat 8 thus m sebali 10 m et values were produced while applying the proposed equation found between the standard sebali and m sebali with monthly only climatic data root mean square error rmse and absolut mean error ame were then calculated between the generated m sebali 10 m et values and the existent eddy covariance flux tower et values in donghuayuan town china between 2016 and 2017 3 3 wheat seasonal trend the seasonal et trend was produced in wheat fields in lebanon based on the sentinel 2 et generated m sebali values corresponding to monthly et data between november 2018 and july 2019 it was followed by a map showing the whole plain seasonal et values based on the same sensor 4 results 4 1 correlation between instantaneous and daily versus monthly climatic data a correlation was made between et values generated from the standard sebali and the m sebali with monthly only climatic data fig 4 in the bekaa valley lebanon between august 2017 and june 2018 it has shown a high pearson regression corresponding to 93 3 the correlation equation is as follows 1 e t s e b a l i 0 92 e t m s e b a l i 2 089 4 2 validations 4 2 1 landsat 8 et values based on monthly climatic data root mean square error rmse and absolut mean error ame were calculated using standard sebali and m sebali table 2 in four countries i e belgium germany china and italy in comparison to the flux towers datasets rsme and ame values were highly comparable with m sebali rmse and ame values of 24 mm month and 21 mm month respectively 4 2 2 sentinel 2 et values based on monthly climatic data as shown in table 3 rmse and ame were much better in m sebali i e sebali rmse 38 23 mm month versus m sebali 20 06 mm month and thus m sebali enabled an accurate estimation of et it is also important to notice that both rsme and ame sentinel 2 m sebali have better values than m sebali landsat 8 it is important to note that rmse and ame values were retrieved by comparing sebali et values and flux towers datasets on the one hand and m sebali et values and flux towers datasets on the other hand 4 3 wheat seasonal trend with almost 40 mm of precipitation in november and as winter season progress in the bekaa valley the precipitation amount soars until january with a maximum of nearly 160 mm the following months showed a decreasing trend the monthly mean et curve in winter wheat parcels within the selected study area illustrated a small peak in january followed by a decrease in february but then again a much larger and higher peak was seen between april and july with a monthly mean et value of approximately 140 mm and no precipitations in june the total precipitation between november 2017 and july 2018 corresponded to 510 mm the seasonal et value averaged between the selected parcels showed a value of 620 mm between the same period fig 5 as the selected wheat parcels exist within a semi arid region their seasonal et showed similar range of values on the other hand the southern part of the plain is showing much larger seasonal et value between the same temporal frame low seasonal et values were shown in the mountain ranges where most of the bare lands with high slope angles exit fig 6 4 4 comparison between landast 8 and sentinel 2 outputs a comparison of annual et values assessed through landsat 8 and sentinel 2 m sebali is shown in fig 7 highlighting the much better spatial resolution of the generated outputs from sentinel 2 satellite data the difference is particularly visible at the scale of 1 5000 when roads and parcels boundaries are clearly distinguished in the et sentinel 2 image 5 discussion 5 1 m sebali model with a high pearson value of 93 3 accurate et estimations through sebali could be now derived from monthly only climatic datasets even when comparing the generated et values from m sebali with flux towers data errors were very promising i e rmse and ame less than 24 mm month this improvement is highly important in regions lacking accurate detailed or even having costly climatic datasets moreover users and policy makers will save on time and resources when fetching and including climatic datasets as inputs in any of the widely available seb models when the proposed straightforward approach is applied these models will be more simplified and consume less processing time still future studies could focus on analyzing the sensitivity of each climatic factor when feasible climatic datasets collected usually from local weather station could be then fetched from satellite weather data providing accurate and reliable et measurements the generation of 10 m et values has been discussed and proposed previously in the literature yet to our knowledge none of these studies were able to exclude thermal infarred tir landsat 8 bands and while some studies have already showed a good correlation between ndvi and albedo generated by two type of sensors e g mandanici and bitelli 2016 zhang et al 2018 it was not the case in our selected study areas thus surface energy balance modelers and experts should be careful when using the proposed previous correlations to relate ndvi and albedo from two different satellite datasets still when our proposed equation i e eq 1 is applied to the final et sentinel 2 output generated from monthly median satellite images retrieved through google earth engine rsme and ame showed values less than 20 mm month even better than landsat 8 et values this could be related to the higher spatial and temporal resolutions of the ndvi and albedo products deduced from sentinel 2 enabling an accurate representation of the heterogeneity of the agricultural fields and other land features this was particularly shown when comparing both data outputs in fig 7 5 2 wheat seasonal trend in november low et values were shown as presented in fig 6 due to the lack of vegetation cover which resulted in very low transpiration values it was coupled with high relative humidity and precipitation rates as well as low air temperatures and solar incoming radiations which lowered the potential evapotranspiration rates as well the monthly mean et values have increased following the dormancy period february march signaling the development of wheat phenological stages these stages generally require a high consumption of water leading to an increase in the total et in may wheat reaches its maximum vegetative growth thus the crop actual et is at its highest level requiring a significant amount of water particularly where precipitations are lacking and weather conditions are optimal for more consumption of water in the following reproductive stage the canopy dries up and the transpiration decreases to reach a very low level the cultivar is then harvested the time of harvest might change between farmers which was illustrated in fig 5 with the highest standard deviation of et values appeared between june and july the soil evaporation at these development stages was masked by the much higher transpiration values anyhow the wheat seasonal et trend was similar to many previous studies e g mhawej et al 2020a suggesting two peaks with one much higher than the other the selected wheat parcels exist in a semi arid region with usually a scarcity in water resources such limitation forces farmers to follow somehow identical irrigation amount and scheduling which was shown in the similar ranges of et values still most of the farmers in this region depend on rainfall to irrigate their fields with close precipitation and mean et values shown in these parcels in contrast the southern part of the plain showed much higher agricultural water consumption due the existent of large number of wells its proximity to a large lake i e karaoun lake 33 581e 35 663 n but more importantly more optimal climatic conditions enabling the cultivation of other water demanding crops of course bare lands which are common in mountain ranges showed the lowest et values which is affected by the steep slopes lower temperatures and higher erosions 5 3 recommendations and limitations as discussed in numerous publications e g mandanici and bitelli 2016 zhang et al 2018 albedo and ndvi produce different values when assessed using landsat 8 and sentinel 2 such limitation affects the ability of sentinel 2 to accurately estimate et values particularly if the overpass time between the two satellites is more than two days zhang et al 2018 this was also found when plotting albedo and ndvi between august 2017 and june 2018 over the bekaa plain lebanon an acceptable but not reliable correlations have been found fig 8 as a result in this study each sensor was used alone and was compared to the actual eddy covariance flux tower et values furthermore the median monthly satellite values were assessed to reduce biases related to temporal and spatial changes particularly visible when the crop phenological stage changes also a limitation exists when trying to define an accurate area surrounding the eddy covariance flux towers as discussed in mhawej et al 2020b thus in this study parcels where each flux tower exist was considered as surrogate to the generated ground et values even though these parcels could sometimes have deformed non square or even huge areas still the comparison between the generated et values from standard sebali and m sebali i e when the equation is applied and flux towers is based on the mean values generated from these models i e sebali and m sebali the standard deviation was not taken into consideration however when considered rmse and ame values could decrease much further as the generated values will better represent the actual spatial conditions existent and reduce errors generated from accurately identifying the eddy covariance included zones in field heterogeneity and diverse managements 5 4 strengths and future research the generation of 10 m et values from monthly only climatic datasets followed two global trends the first is related to the reduction of water consumption and the increase of water productivity even at the finer scale the second is related to the simplification of complex models that any inhabitant could be part of the solution at these two levels m sebali succeeded by reducing the required variables even further than sebali and by proposing an enhancement approach that generates et using the highest available free of charge spatial resolution satellite images this information could help decision makers and local governance bodies as well as farmers to better manage water resources at both local and farm scale levels ultimately it will contribute towards improving the surface energy balance modelling and at larger extent the environmental and agricultural modelling future studies could focus on applying sebali with different available sensors e g landsat 5 landsat 7 advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflectance radiometer aster to assess historical et trends and values the retrieval of sentinel 2 albedo in this paper was based on the only available vanino et al 2018 sentinel 2 albedo approach which appeared to be biased bonafoni et al 2020 still a very promising rmse and ame was shown when using sentinel 2 datasets alongside eq 1 anyhow the new weighting factors for the computation of sentinel 2 albedo shall be applied whenever available to check if rmse and ame improve even further while m sebali and sebali are already produced as an automated system migrating these models to gee platform is recommended as it delivers cloud based system for both fetching and processing of the satellite datasets including m sebali within a water accounting system is also advisable for a complete water assessment approach finally providing diverse calibration equations in other climatic regions is needed that m sebali could be applied at a larger scale and its 10 m outputs could be accurately derived worldwide 6 conclusion data fusion studies are constantly increasing within a wide range of research their main objectives are to increase spatial temporal and even spectral resolutions of the used sensors in this context this paper has shown a novel approach to derive 10 m et values from freely available satellite images more importantly it was able to eliminate several required inputs to run the recently proposed sebali model such improvement can be applied to other seb models and even can be used in other climate and water related studies particularly in climatic regions similar to those studied in this paper on the other hand our findings showed mediocre relationship between landsat 8 and sentinel 2 outputs i e ndvi and albedo wheat et showed an averaged mean seasonal value of 620 mm with two peaks one in january and the other in may also higher et rates were illustrated in the southern part of the bekaa plain finally with a very promising rsme and ame i e 20 06 mm month and 15 69 mm month respectively m sebali could be implemented to retrieve the much needed et information and ultimately increase water productivity at both regional and national levels in different climatic regions worldwide declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10365,actual and potential evapotranspiration et are important variables for regional and global environmental modelling these elements provide better understanding and management of the hydrological cycle particularly in relation to several environmental stresses affecting ecosystems with the advancement of airborne techniques remote sensing approaches have enabled an accurate estimation of crop actual et with limited field visits in this study an enhanced version i e m sebali of the improved surface energy balance model for land surnamed sebali will be presented main improvements concern the retrieval of 10 m et values using sentinel 2 images and modis terra lst 1 km datasets the other enhancement considers the usage of monthly only climatic datasets instead of the required hourly daily and monthly data in sebali calibrations and validations were made in china belgium germany lebanon and italy between 2013 and 2017 yielding adequate rsme i e 20 06 mm month and ame i e 15 69 mm month values these countries represent four different climatic regions i e continental semi arid monsoon influenced warm summer humid continental mediterranean hot summer and oceanic climates thus landast 8 thermal bands will be unnecessary to implement sebali also the conversion between hourly and daily climatic data and monthly climatic datasets in sebali showed a pearson value of 93 3 thus seven of the required inputs in sebali were eliminated in m sebali saving on time and resources furthermore the wheat seasonal trend is produced in the bekaa valley lebanon between november 2018 and july 2019 showing an average et value of 620 mm in a region with 510 mm of precipitations during the same period two peaks were visible in january and may signaling the different wheat phenological stages the importance of m sebali lies in providing an automated retrieval of 10 m et biomass production and water productivity wp among other variables in diverse climatic regions such improvements shall improve the assessment of et and wp towards better management of water resources particularly in regions lacking some required inputs keywords sebali modis water productivity china developing country farm scale 1 introduction evapotranspiration et rates are a key factor in assessing water needs and demands nasrallah et al 2019 2020 establishing an et system that can accurately estimate water consumption is particularly pivotal to increase our understanding of the crop water productivity while conserving water resources for our future generations mhawej et al 2020a such system should benefit from the advancement of the airborne technologies mainly in the areas of remote sensing techniques promising saving on time personal and resources faour et al 2018 ghoussein et al 2018 furthermore with the migration towards cloud computing tchernykh et al 2019 these et systems should be more user oriented and widely applicable in any region across the globe when retrieved et rates could be included with water influxes such as precipitation and groundwater amounts to conduct a comprehensive water accounting for a specific basin karimi et al 2013 several previous surface energy balance seb models studies were proposed based on satellite images and remote sensing techniques such as the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a b the mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution using internalized calibration metric allen et al 2005 2007 the surface energy balance index sebi menenti and choudhury 1993 the surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 and the et watch wu et al 2008 in these approaches et is considered as a residual of the surface energy balance liou and kar 2014 validations of these systems showed an annual fluctuation between 5 36 in comparison to flux towers et values mhawej et al 2020b their main used satellite sensors include modis avhrr gimms landsat with the latter having the best spatial resolution of 30 m still limitations exist when implementing any of these seb models particularly related to the large number of the required inputs mhawej et al 2020a b in this context an improved et model surnamed surface energy balance algorithm for land improved sebali was proposed in 2020 bridging the gaps between the previously available models main enhancements of sebali concern a reduced number of required inputs a more adequate automated and dynamic selection of hot cold pixels over agricultural areas the usage of atmospherically corrected i e bottom of atmosphere satellite images and the usage of water stress ws factor as a surrogate to the vapor pressure deficit vpd and the soil related datasets a detailed description of sebali is found in mhawej et al 2020a b furthermore the highest spatial resolution et value produced to our knowledge is based on the landsat satellites with a 30 m spatial resolution more precisely none of the previous studies was able to accurately produce 10 m et outputs using for instance sentinel 2 satellite images even though the latter was launched nearly five years ago sentinel 2 has his advantages over using landsat 8 satellite images in terms of better spatial spectral and temporal resolutions more precisely a study conducted by battude et al 2016 has tried to tackle the usage of sentinel 2 satellite by proposing a robust and generic method in maize fields using sentinel 2 like remote sensing data this study paved the road towards using sentinel 2 datasets in et related studies even though it falls short when extrapolated spatially temporally and to other crops type sadeghi et al 2017 has proposed the widely acknowledged trapezoid model using both setinel 2 and landsat 8 images while the latter approach proved its limitations to accurately predict et values the main concern would be to merge data fusion on both spatial and temporal contexts between these two types of data as discussed by mandanici and bitelli 2016 and zhang et al 2018 in others researches e g sharma and tare 2018 vanino et al 2018 mokhtari et al 2019 authors have tried to implement several seb models including a combination of sentinel 2 and landsat 8 satellites still one of the proposed approaches i e vanino et al 2018 appeared to be biased and unreliable as discussed in bonafoni et al 2020 thus this paper will present an enhancement over the previously proposed sebali model surnamed monthly sebali or m sebali these improvements concern the requirement of monthly climatic datasets only as well as retrieving 10 m et rates without the need of landat 8 thermal bands these enhancements will enable professional and non specialist particularly in developing countries to asses et with a limited number of factors and in an automated manner while sebali et rates based on landsat 8 was validated in diverse climatic regions mhawej et al 2020a b and in different countries e g united states germany netherlands italy a validation for the 30 m landsat 8 et values based on monthly datasets is carried out in four countries i e china belgium germany and italy with three different climates i e with monsoon influenced warm summer humid continental mediterranean hot summer and oceanic climates m sebali was calibrated and validated as well in two agricultural lands in china and in lebanon with monsoon influenced warm summer humid continental and continental semi arid respectively furthermore wheat seasonal et trend for the season 2018 2019 was produced in the bekaa valley lebanon based on the newly proposed m sebali with 10 m et outputs finally a map for the whole region is generated followed by further assessments and discussions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area in lebanon concerns the bekaa plain or valley fig 1 perched between two mountainous ranges and consisting of three natural units the mount lebanon mountains the valley unit and the anti lebanon mountains the average altitude is 1050 m a s l and could extend to 1200 m a s l the prevailing climate is continental semi arid with an average annual precipitation of 592 mm a variety of rock formations including sand sandy clay loam silty clay loam and loam exist within the bekaa valley allaw et al 2015 agriculture is the main economic activity in the plain with the cereal parcels predominate the region during winter season mhawej et al 2020a in this context wheat parcels were selected based on reporting from local farmers several field visits and satellite images they are usually sowed in november with a development stage ending in late june still different cropping patterns exist within the region including fallow early potato late potato wheat and wheat fallow wheat alfalfa orchard and vineyard are also cultivated within the plain eddy covariance et datasets for landsat 8 validations were provided from four different countries including belgium germany china and italy fig 2 the flux towers were established in cultivated lands such as cereals root crops leguminous crops oil crops vegetables vineyards and tobacco the selection of these locations was based only on the existent of an agricultural land beneath these towers thus to include different countries with diverse climatic regions for a better validation process other cultivations type available in the region correspond to weeded crops olives groves and other annual crops furthermore complex cultivation patterns dominate these regions according to the koppen classification belgium and germany prevail an oceanic climate with the coldest month averaging above 0 c the mean annual temperature is around 22 c italy has a prevailing mediterranean hot summer climate with usually hot and dry summers elevations at flux towers sites range between 0 and 478 m mean annual temperatures fluctuate between 7 6 c and 15 6 c and mean annual precipitation between 421 and 842 mm the study area used for sentinel 2 validations in china concerns the donghuayuan town huailai county hebei province located at the guating reservoir fig 2 the average altitude is 700 m a s l with a soil type typically clay and sandy with an average annual precipitation around 525 mm and an abundant sunshine zone this region provides an adequate environment for vineyards plantation shi et al 2016 still at the province scale the total cultivated lands represent one third of the total hebei province area of 188 800 km2 corn plantations account for nearly half of the total cropland based on the national census in 2016 cotton plantations could be seen as well in the province 2 2 data background 2 2 1 satellite data landsat 8 provides 30 meter spatial resolution images a revisit time of 16 day and two infrared bands at 100 m i e bands 10 and 11 level 1 or top of atmosphere toa and level 2 or bottom of atmosphere boa images exist the processed landsat 8 level 2 datasets correspond to atmospherically corrected satellite images generated from the land surface reflectance code lasrc data used in this study corresponds to boa landsat 8 which could be acquired from usgs official website i e https earthexplorer usgs gov it is important to note that because of the low temporal resolution of the landast 8 in only very limited cases more than two satellite images could be seen in a specific month on the other hand sentinel 2 offers 10 m 20 m and 60 m spatial resolution 13 bands with a revisit time of five days when considering both sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b satellites multiple levels of processing exist in sentinel 2 products while the level 0 is the raw image data the level 1c is a radio corrected and geo refined product obtained from processing and refining the input level 1a toa radiance data however the level 2a of sentinel 2 is similar to level 2 landsat 8 including scene classifications and atmospheric corrections thus datasets of level 2a were downloaded from the official europe s copernicus website and used in this study the land surface temperature lst product derived from modis sensor satellite images also known as mod11 for terra and myd11 for aqua is available through the distributed active archive center daac of the national snow and ice data center nsidc i e https earthdata nasa gov since september 2000 the mod11 is calculated at 1 km pixels by the generalized split window algorithm and at 6 km grids by the day night algorithm the end products include daytime and nighttime lsts quality assessment observation time view angles and emissivity in this study the 1 km modis lst day was used along its quality assessment band it is important to note that landsat 8 sentinel 2 and modis lst could be assessed and fetched from the google earth engine gee at https code earthengine google com this latter combines a multi petabyte catalog of satellite images and geospatial datasets assisting researchers and planners to monitor changes and map trends on the earth s surface in this study the used remote sensing datasets were downloaded from gee using a specialized script that calculates the monthly median of all available images in each of the landsat 8 boa sr sentinel 2 level 2a and modis lst datasets following a cloud removal process annex i 2 2 2 ground data with the effort of many scientists and technicians around the world the fluxnet2015 dataset were established from multiple regional flux networks at more than 200 different sites between 1991 and 2014 the fluxnet2015 dataset includes several data quality control protocols and a data processing pipeline more precisely close interaction with tower teams were made to improve data quality novel methods for uncertainty quantification use of reanalysis data to fill long gaps of meteorological variable records among others in this study eddy covariance et datasets were used to validate landsat 8 et values generated from monthly data only they were downloaded from the official data portal of the fluxnet community available at https fluxnet fluxdata org three main regions were considered based on the availability of ground based et tower datasets after 2013 coinciding with the launch of landsat 8 these regions correspond to belgium 4 74623e 50 55162 n with data between march and october 2014 germany 13 52238e 50 89306 n with data between august and october 2014 and italy 12 02656e 42 38041 n 12 02604e 42 37722 n 12 0222e 42 38 n having data between september 2013 and december 2014 the missing months correspond to missing values from the measured ground based et or missing landsat 8 images due to bad weather conditions data doi for each site is available in table 1 ground et for sentinel 2 validations were collected from an eddy covariance located in donghuayuan town china at 115 7880e 40 3491 n between january 2016 and december 2017 the acquisition frequency of the vortex correlator is 10 hz with an altitude of 5 m the direction of the ultrasound is true north with a distance between the ultrasonic anemometer csat3 and the co2 h2o analyzer li7500a of 15 cm outputs are 30 minute data obtained by post processing using eddypro software the post processing includes outlier value elimination delay time correction coordinate rotation frequency response correction ultrasound virtual temperature and density correction this was done through the following steps 1 identifying when the instrument is providing erroneous data with a huge sudden change between two consecutive measurements 2 showing the data before and after one hour of precipitation 3 highlighting raw data with a missing rate greater than 10 within the 30 min data 4 and finally excluding the observation data of weak turbulence at night which is usually less than 0 1 m s furthermore the quality of each flux value is evaluated through the atmospheric and turbulence stability tests the quality labels for sensible heat latent heat and carbon dioxide flux are divided into three levels of quality for further assessments climatic data such as temperature relative humidity wind speed and incoming solar radiation for the selected regions were retrieved from their corresponding flux towers as for lebanon a nearby weather station located in tal amara riyak 33 8613231e 35 9879912 n were used to provide the needed climatic factors for sebali in the years of 2018 and 2019 2 3 sebali background sebali is the newest iteration of the widely acknowledged sebal model proposed since the 90 s still the implementation of the sebal model or its main iteration metric model requires a set of factors generally lacking in many countries around the globe moreover remote sensing inputs required in such models were not updated along the huge improvements in satellite images particularly considering the higher spatial and temporal resolutions currently available for instance toa landsat images are used with a transformation from digital number dn to radiance that does not particularly fit the newly available landsat 8 then while atmospheric biases found in toa datasets might affect final et outputs the usage of erroneous transformation as found in the sebal open source python script or py sebal is deriving questionable et values in many locations particularly in the bekaa valley of lebanon this was found as well through the processing of the readily available landast 8 sebal et values found in the fao water productivity open access portal wapor accessible at wapor apps fao org more precisely many wheat fields registered seasonal et values of 200 mm within a region of 500 mm of precipitation in this context sebali was proposed using improvements found in the previous surface energy balance models among many other unrelated models such enhancements enabled the reduction of the required factors to implement sebali but more importantly to be updated with the relatively new landsat 8 images thus sebali has eliminated the needs of instantaneous relative humidity saturated soil moisture content saturated soil moisture content in the subsoil residual soil moisture content field capacity wilting point as discussed in mhawej et al 2020a and replace many of them by the water stress approach this latter was well welcomed in the literature particularly because soil moisture is difficult to be characterized over large areas from either modeling or remote sensing on the other hand vapor pressure deficit vpd controlling the moisture availability on plant photosynthesis changes tremendously over heterogeneous landscapes rendering any linear relation between vpd and soil water availability very difficult to be achieved mhawej et al 2020a the water stress equation used in many previous studies as discussed in mhawej et al 2020a is as follows 1 w s l e l e h where le is the latent heat flux in w m 2 corresponding to the instantaneous et and h is sensible heat flux in w m 2 this equation is based in the fact that the decreasing amount of energy partitioned into latent heat flux suggests a stronger moisture limitation thus the usage of this factor has enabled the assessment of seasonal and annual et and biomass production in lebanon where soil related data are missing mhawej et al 2020a b furthermore sebali has included the selection of the hot cold pixel approach proposed by the metric model where only agricultural pixels could be considered such addition has provided a better internal calibration of the model mhawej et al 2020a still sebali has added its own two step calibration method based on the existent local or regional water bodies the hypothesis was that water bodies were treated as cold pixels where the sensible heat is minimum transpiration is null and the evapotranspiration is maximum mhawej et al 2020b thus the sensible heat flux over water bodies is calculated and then compared to the generated mean h values over the whole region the highest value is selected the second step of the calibration concerns the comparison between the latent heat flux of water and then compared to the generated mean et values the final et values is then adjusted accordingly mhawej et al 2020b furthermore the calibration value has been automated as well through the usage of the fao irrigation and drainage paper no 24 pan coefficient value as discussed in mhawej et al 2020b it is important to note that these improvements are processed in an automated manner saving on time and resources lastly surface reflectance sr boa atmospherically corrected landsat 8 images were incorporated the quality assessment qa band was included as well for cloud detection and removal even though the implementation of sebali generated an r squared value of 88 4 compared to many flux towers in different countries with diverse climates mhawej et al 2020a b sebali requires diverse inputs as satellite climatic and anchor datasets are needed to implement the model detailed in fig 3 3 methods the proposed monthly sebali i e m sebali model in this manuscript aimed 1 to reduce the number of inputs over the sebali model as well as 2 to retrieve 10 m et values using sentinel 2 images to our knowledge none of these two improvements were previously found in the literature 3 1 reduce the number of inputs reducing the number of climatic inputs has begun by assessing the feasibility of eliminating the need of instantaneous and daily at satellite overpass climatic data which could be lacking in some regions but more importantly to reduce efforts and time the hypothesis here is that as sebali is providing et values at monthly scale the usage of monthly only datasets might also be adequate this is encouraged by the existence of multiple internal and dynamic calibrations in sebali model thus instantaneous at satellite overpass temperature wind speed and transmissivity and daily at satellite overpass temperature relative humidity wind speed and transmissivity were excluded the followed approach was straightforward more particularly a comparison between monthly et outputs produced under the standard sebali and m sebali with monthly only inputs was made the used datasets concerned monthly et values between august 2017 and june 2018 with nearly 4800 pixels over agricultural areas in the bekaa valley lebanon the selection of this region is related to our possession of highly accurate crop database in those selected pixels and thus to reduce inherited biases the objective was to retrieve a relationship between standard sebali et and m sebali et values which have further assisted in reducing the needed climatic data in m sebali and applying the retrieved relation instead in lebanon and other studied countries as well more particularly a high correlation was found between the et values of the two models i e sebali and m sebali over those 4800 pixels the retrieved relation equation was then applied to m sebali et values using landsat 8 boa datasets over belgium germany china and italy with monthly only climatic datasets root mean square error rmse and absolut mean error ame were calculated between the generated m sebali et values and the existent eddy covariance flux towers et values between 2013 and 2017 3 2 retrieve sentinel 2 10 m et values in order to improve the spatial resolution of sebali sentinel 2 10 m images coupled with modis lst 1 km satellite data were tested using both the standard sebali and m sebali with monthly only climatic datasets the usage of modis lst product is crucial as sentinel 2 satellite alone does not provide much needed thermal bands for the calculation of lst and later the evapotranspiration rates on the other hand when landsat 8 30 m satellite data are used thermal bands exist in bands 10 and 11 anyhow the usage of modis lst 1 km data was possible due to the actual usage of the lst in many surface energy balance models e g sebali sebal metric which is primarily for the identification of hot and cold pixels a misguided conception exists in that matter proclaiming that lst data are crucial to provide indirect information on the vegetation hydric conditions at pixel level actually the spatial resolution of the lst used is these type of models does not affect the final et outputs particularly if the concerned lst pixel size is less than the available agricultural lands this is due to the fact that the assessment of hot cold pixels is aimed to propose a linear equation that would derive the relation between air temperatures at two different heights this relation is then used to calculate the much needed dt factor for the assessment of the sensible heat flux furthermore in seb models such as sebali and metric the selection of hot cold pixels is based as well on the agricultural surface not only lst which is usually of higher spatial resolution of lst as modis datasets were used for the retrieval of lst sentinel 2 datasets are used for the assessment of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and albedo as found in faour et al 2015 2016 2018 modis lst data were selected as they provide daily information that could coincide with the overpass time of sentinel 2 moreover this product provides lst ready information as well as a quality assessment band generally missing when retrieving lst from landsat 8 thus m sebali 10 m et values were produced while applying the proposed equation found between the standard sebali and m sebali with monthly only climatic data root mean square error rmse and absolut mean error ame were then calculated between the generated m sebali 10 m et values and the existent eddy covariance flux tower et values in donghuayuan town china between 2016 and 2017 3 3 wheat seasonal trend the seasonal et trend was produced in wheat fields in lebanon based on the sentinel 2 et generated m sebali values corresponding to monthly et data between november 2018 and july 2019 it was followed by a map showing the whole plain seasonal et values based on the same sensor 4 results 4 1 correlation between instantaneous and daily versus monthly climatic data a correlation was made between et values generated from the standard sebali and the m sebali with monthly only climatic data fig 4 in the bekaa valley lebanon between august 2017 and june 2018 it has shown a high pearson regression corresponding to 93 3 the correlation equation is as follows 1 e t s e b a l i 0 92 e t m s e b a l i 2 089 4 2 validations 4 2 1 landsat 8 et values based on monthly climatic data root mean square error rmse and absolut mean error ame were calculated using standard sebali and m sebali table 2 in four countries i e belgium germany china and italy in comparison to the flux towers datasets rsme and ame values were highly comparable with m sebali rmse and ame values of 24 mm month and 21 mm month respectively 4 2 2 sentinel 2 et values based on monthly climatic data as shown in table 3 rmse and ame were much better in m sebali i e sebali rmse 38 23 mm month versus m sebali 20 06 mm month and thus m sebali enabled an accurate estimation of et it is also important to notice that both rsme and ame sentinel 2 m sebali have better values than m sebali landsat 8 it is important to note that rmse and ame values were retrieved by comparing sebali et values and flux towers datasets on the one hand and m sebali et values and flux towers datasets on the other hand 4 3 wheat seasonal trend with almost 40 mm of precipitation in november and as winter season progress in the bekaa valley the precipitation amount soars until january with a maximum of nearly 160 mm the following months showed a decreasing trend the monthly mean et curve in winter wheat parcels within the selected study area illustrated a small peak in january followed by a decrease in february but then again a much larger and higher peak was seen between april and july with a monthly mean et value of approximately 140 mm and no precipitations in june the total precipitation between november 2017 and july 2018 corresponded to 510 mm the seasonal et value averaged between the selected parcels showed a value of 620 mm between the same period fig 5 as the selected wheat parcels exist within a semi arid region their seasonal et showed similar range of values on the other hand the southern part of the plain is showing much larger seasonal et value between the same temporal frame low seasonal et values were shown in the mountain ranges where most of the bare lands with high slope angles exit fig 6 4 4 comparison between landast 8 and sentinel 2 outputs a comparison of annual et values assessed through landsat 8 and sentinel 2 m sebali is shown in fig 7 highlighting the much better spatial resolution of the generated outputs from sentinel 2 satellite data the difference is particularly visible at the scale of 1 5000 when roads and parcels boundaries are clearly distinguished in the et sentinel 2 image 5 discussion 5 1 m sebali model with a high pearson value of 93 3 accurate et estimations through sebali could be now derived from monthly only climatic datasets even when comparing the generated et values from m sebali with flux towers data errors were very promising i e rmse and ame less than 24 mm month this improvement is highly important in regions lacking accurate detailed or even having costly climatic datasets moreover users and policy makers will save on time and resources when fetching and including climatic datasets as inputs in any of the widely available seb models when the proposed straightforward approach is applied these models will be more simplified and consume less processing time still future studies could focus on analyzing the sensitivity of each climatic factor when feasible climatic datasets collected usually from local weather station could be then fetched from satellite weather data providing accurate and reliable et measurements the generation of 10 m et values has been discussed and proposed previously in the literature yet to our knowledge none of these studies were able to exclude thermal infarred tir landsat 8 bands and while some studies have already showed a good correlation between ndvi and albedo generated by two type of sensors e g mandanici and bitelli 2016 zhang et al 2018 it was not the case in our selected study areas thus surface energy balance modelers and experts should be careful when using the proposed previous correlations to relate ndvi and albedo from two different satellite datasets still when our proposed equation i e eq 1 is applied to the final et sentinel 2 output generated from monthly median satellite images retrieved through google earth engine rsme and ame showed values less than 20 mm month even better than landsat 8 et values this could be related to the higher spatial and temporal resolutions of the ndvi and albedo products deduced from sentinel 2 enabling an accurate representation of the heterogeneity of the agricultural fields and other land features this was particularly shown when comparing both data outputs in fig 7 5 2 wheat seasonal trend in november low et values were shown as presented in fig 6 due to the lack of vegetation cover which resulted in very low transpiration values it was coupled with high relative humidity and precipitation rates as well as low air temperatures and solar incoming radiations which lowered the potential evapotranspiration rates as well the monthly mean et values have increased following the dormancy period february march signaling the development of wheat phenological stages these stages generally require a high consumption of water leading to an increase in the total et in may wheat reaches its maximum vegetative growth thus the crop actual et is at its highest level requiring a significant amount of water particularly where precipitations are lacking and weather conditions are optimal for more consumption of water in the following reproductive stage the canopy dries up and the transpiration decreases to reach a very low level the cultivar is then harvested the time of harvest might change between farmers which was illustrated in fig 5 with the highest standard deviation of et values appeared between june and july the soil evaporation at these development stages was masked by the much higher transpiration values anyhow the wheat seasonal et trend was similar to many previous studies e g mhawej et al 2020a suggesting two peaks with one much higher than the other the selected wheat parcels exist in a semi arid region with usually a scarcity in water resources such limitation forces farmers to follow somehow identical irrigation amount and scheduling which was shown in the similar ranges of et values still most of the farmers in this region depend on rainfall to irrigate their fields with close precipitation and mean et values shown in these parcels in contrast the southern part of the plain showed much higher agricultural water consumption due the existent of large number of wells its proximity to a large lake i e karaoun lake 33 581e 35 663 n but more importantly more optimal climatic conditions enabling the cultivation of other water demanding crops of course bare lands which are common in mountain ranges showed the lowest et values which is affected by the steep slopes lower temperatures and higher erosions 5 3 recommendations and limitations as discussed in numerous publications e g mandanici and bitelli 2016 zhang et al 2018 albedo and ndvi produce different values when assessed using landsat 8 and sentinel 2 such limitation affects the ability of sentinel 2 to accurately estimate et values particularly if the overpass time between the two satellites is more than two days zhang et al 2018 this was also found when plotting albedo and ndvi between august 2017 and june 2018 over the bekaa plain lebanon an acceptable but not reliable correlations have been found fig 8 as a result in this study each sensor was used alone and was compared to the actual eddy covariance flux tower et values furthermore the median monthly satellite values were assessed to reduce biases related to temporal and spatial changes particularly visible when the crop phenological stage changes also a limitation exists when trying to define an accurate area surrounding the eddy covariance flux towers as discussed in mhawej et al 2020b thus in this study parcels where each flux tower exist was considered as surrogate to the generated ground et values even though these parcels could sometimes have deformed non square or even huge areas still the comparison between the generated et values from standard sebali and m sebali i e when the equation is applied and flux towers is based on the mean values generated from these models i e sebali and m sebali the standard deviation was not taken into consideration however when considered rmse and ame values could decrease much further as the generated values will better represent the actual spatial conditions existent and reduce errors generated from accurately identifying the eddy covariance included zones in field heterogeneity and diverse managements 5 4 strengths and future research the generation of 10 m et values from monthly only climatic datasets followed two global trends the first is related to the reduction of water consumption and the increase of water productivity even at the finer scale the second is related to the simplification of complex models that any inhabitant could be part of the solution at these two levels m sebali succeeded by reducing the required variables even further than sebali and by proposing an enhancement approach that generates et using the highest available free of charge spatial resolution satellite images this information could help decision makers and local governance bodies as well as farmers to better manage water resources at both local and farm scale levels ultimately it will contribute towards improving the surface energy balance modelling and at larger extent the environmental and agricultural modelling future studies could focus on applying sebali with different available sensors e g landsat 5 landsat 7 advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflectance radiometer aster to assess historical et trends and values the retrieval of sentinel 2 albedo in this paper was based on the only available vanino et al 2018 sentinel 2 albedo approach which appeared to be biased bonafoni et al 2020 still a very promising rmse and ame was shown when using sentinel 2 datasets alongside eq 1 anyhow the new weighting factors for the computation of sentinel 2 albedo shall be applied whenever available to check if rmse and ame improve even further while m sebali and sebali are already produced as an automated system migrating these models to gee platform is recommended as it delivers cloud based system for both fetching and processing of the satellite datasets including m sebali within a water accounting system is also advisable for a complete water assessment approach finally providing diverse calibration equations in other climatic regions is needed that m sebali could be applied at a larger scale and its 10 m outputs could be accurately derived worldwide 6 conclusion data fusion studies are constantly increasing within a wide range of research their main objectives are to increase spatial temporal and even spectral resolutions of the used sensors in this context this paper has shown a novel approach to derive 10 m et values from freely available satellite images more importantly it was able to eliminate several required inputs to run the recently proposed sebali model such improvement can be applied to other seb models and even can be used in other climate and water related studies particularly in climatic regions similar to those studied in this paper on the other hand our findings showed mediocre relationship between landsat 8 and sentinel 2 outputs i e ndvi and albedo wheat et showed an averaged mean seasonal value of 620 mm with two peaks one in january and the other in may also higher et rates were illustrated in the southern part of the bekaa plain finally with a very promising rsme and ame i e 20 06 mm month and 15 69 mm month respectively m sebali could be implemented to retrieve the much needed et information and ultimately increase water productivity at both regional and national levels in different climatic regions worldwide declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

wue of winter wheat in the normal season but increased that by 67 in the dry season compared to w0 w1 had a rare effect on evapotranspiration et and wue of summer maize overall w1 decreased annual wue of wheat maize system by 9 in the normal years while it increased that by 8 in the dry years manure application fm and fc m increased wue of winter wheat by 5 9 compared to chemical fertilization fc due to the lower et after anthesis however manure application decreased wue of summer maize by 6 10 than chemical fertilization which caused by the higher et before anthesis therefore fertilization strategies had a minor effect on annual wue of wheat maize system in conclusion the replacement of mineral n with manure under deficient irrigation provides a better fertilization strategy to maintain annual wue of wheat maize system which has the potential to relieve the regional water scarcity for sustainable agriculture production in the north china plain keywords water use efficiency manure fertilization soil water storage evapotranspiration 1 introduction sustainable management of water resources is one of the global environmental challenges in the 21 st century rodell et al 2018 the total fresh water volume in china is 2 81 1012 m3 ranking 6th in the world however the water resource per capita in china is only one fourth of the world average piao et al 2010 and distributes unevenly in space the north of china occupied 65 of china s arable land while it was supported by 18 of the national water resource piao et al 2010 in the north china plain the water resource per capita is less than 500 m3 per year lower than one fourth of china s average zheng et al 2010 subsequently water shortage has been threatening residents living and agricultural production in this area not only the amount and regional distribution of water resource but also the seasonal distribution of rainfall limits agricultural production given that winter wheat summer maize is the main cropping system in the north china plain yang et al 2019 only 20 30 of annual rainfall about 110 180 mm occurs during the wheat growing seasons fang et al 2010 in order to obtain high grain yield 3 4 300 375 mm and 0 2 0 150 mm irrigation times were commonly applied in the wheat and maize seasons respectively sun et al 2010 the intensive irrigation for the cropping system has led to a net groundwater consumption of 170 290 mm yr 1 xu et al 2018a which aggravates the water scarcity reduces the groundwater table and threatens the sustainability of agriculture sun et al 2011 gleeson et al 2012 therefore this calls for water saving strategies to reduce water consumption and increase water use efficiency wue to maintain the regional water balance and sustainable crop production reducing irrigation frequency and amount is a practical approach in agriculture system to save water resources geerts and raes 2009 qiu et al 2008 zhao et al 2020 however limited irrigation usually decreases grain yield due to water deficit at the crop critical growth stages li et al 2010a thapa et al 2019 wen et al 2020 manure application is a practical solution to compensate for the negative effects of water stress by additional nutrient supplements edmeades 2003 gil et al 2008 it also modifies soil physical properties improves the root morphology and stimulates plant growth darwish et al 1995 pan et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 consequently manure application under limited irrigation is supposed to increase wue by raising crop production and taking full advantage of rainfall deng et al 2006 chukalla et al 2018 in addition effective integration of manure in the cropping system also reduces the environmental emissions from the animal production system and decreases the need for mineral fertilizers in the crop production system bouwman et al 2013 which help to enhance nutrient use efficiency with lower environment impacts the effects of irrigation regime or manure application on the wue of winter wheat have been separately evaluated in previous investigations xu et al 2016 wang et al 2017 however few trials focused on the effect of manure application on wue of the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system under seasonal water deficit thus we aimed to 1 evaluate the influence of manure application on wheat wue under limited irrigation 2 estimate the effects of water management in wheat season on wue of maize following wheat and 3 synthesize knowledge about yield evapotranspiration soil water storage rainfall and irrigation to explain the effects of irrigation and fertilization strategies on wue of winter wheat and summer maize 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site a field experiment was carried out from october 2015 to october 2018 at the wuqiao experimental station of china agricultural university 37 41 n 116 36 e in cangzhou city hebei province this region has a typical sub humid continental monsoon climate with a cold winter and a hot summer the heating degree days of winter wheat 0 c and summer maize 8 c are 1800 and 1900 c respectively and the annual frost free period is 201 days zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 the long term average annual rainfall is 562 mm with a sharp seasonal fluctuation and erratic seasonal distribution wang et al 2018a the monthly precipitation air temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed and reference crop evapotranspiration during the experiment are showed in table s1 the soil at the experimental site is loamy mollisols that developed on an alluvial plain the initial characteristics of the 0 20 cm soil layer were as follows soil organic carbon k2cr2o7 oxidation reduction titration method 9 0 g kg 1 total nitrogen kjeldahl digestion method 1 3 g kg 1 total phosphorus mo sb anti spectrophotometric method 1 73 g kg 1 available phosphorous olsen p 89 8 mg kg 1 and soil ph 2 5 1 water to soil ratio v w 7 74 the bulk density field capacity and wilting point in a 200 cm soil depth at the site were presented in table s2 2 2 experimental design and set up in order to investigate the effects of manure application on wue of winter wheat triticum aestivum l cv jimai 22 and summer maize zea mays l cv zhengdan 958 under limited irrigation within a wheat maize double cropping system a fixed field experiment was conducted with combinations of two irrigation treatments and four fertilization treatments the experiment was arranged as a split spot design with three replicates for each treatment and the plot size was 100 m2 10 m 10 m the main plots were two water regimes w1 irrigated once at the jointing stage of winter wheat 90 mm and w0 no irrigation during the whole wheat growing season there was a 2 m buffer to separate the treatments under two water regimes all the treatments received a depth of 90 mm irrigation controlled by flow meter by surface irrigation with a 4 inch plastic coated hose before wheat sowing the effect of water management during wheat season on maize wue was also evaluated the sub plots were four n fertilization treatments f0 no fertilizer fc 100 chemical fertilizer n fc m 50 chemical fertilizer n 50 manure and fm 100 manure fc was fertilized with 157 5 kg n ha 1 60 3 kg p ha 1 and 93 4 kg k ha 1 for winter wheat and 178 5 kg n ha 1 45 2 kg p ha 1 and 93 4 kg k ha 1 for summer maize table s3 the chemical fertilizers were applied in the form of urea diammonium phosphate and potassium sulfate the water content and nutrient composition of the applied manure during the different crop growing seasons was shown in table s4 the applied amounts of manure for fc m fm were determined based on the n inputs their averages were 21 7 43 4 mg ha 1 for winter wheat and 23 7 47 5 mg ha 1 for summer maize respectively the rest n p and k were applied with chemical fertilizers to match the same application rate of n p and k with fc superphosphate was used to match the same amount of p for fc m and fm the same amount of applied manure n led to much more k amount for fc m and fm except fc m in the 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 wheat seasons rotary tillage with residue incorporation was performed for winter wheat and no till with residue mulching was done for summer maize respectively all the manure and chemical fertilizers were surface broadcast as basal fertilizer for winter wheat before rotary tillage 15 cm depth for summer maize 100 of manure chemical fertilizer p chemical fertilizer k and 26 of chemical fertilizer n were applied at the trefoil stage after ditching 15 cm depth and 10 cm width in the middle of plant rows and the rest of chemical fertilizer n 74 was fertilized as topdressing at flare opening stage before rainfall table s3 florasulam and imidacloprid were sprayed for winter wheat to prevent descurainia sophia and aphidoidea at returning green and anthesis stages respectively nicosulfuron and imidacloprid were sprayed for summer maize to control weeds and pests at 4th leaf v4 and 5th leaf v5 stages respectively winter wheat was sown with a 15 cm row spacing summer maize was sown with a 60 cm row spacing and a 24 cm plant distance in a row the amounts of seed and irrigation water and the date of sowing harvest and fertilization were also recorded in this experiment table s5 2 3 sampling and analytical procedures 2 3 1 soil water storage soil moisture was determined at sowing pre winter erecting jointing anthesis grain filling and harvest stages in the wheat growing season and at sowing jointing flare opening anthesis grain filling and harvest stages in the maize growing seasons using the oven drying method fig 1 soil moisture was also measured 2 3 days after irrigation and heavy rainfall soil samples were taken from 0 to 200 cm at 20 cm intervals by a ground auger and dried at 105 c to a constant weight with three replicates the soil water storage sws mm was calculated as follows 1 sws swc ρb sd where swc is the soil water content ρb g cm 3 is soil bulk density and sd mm is soil depth 2 3 2 evapotranspiration the field experiment was conducted under limited irrigation 90 180 mm for winter wheat and 0 90 mm for summer maize and plots between water regimes were separated with 2 m buffer hence the occurrence of surface runoff can be prevented across the growing season the groundwater table has declined to nearly 30 50 m below the surface government information opening platform of cang zhou 2015 so the upward flow into the root zone was negligible the water contents below the 200 cm soil layer were identical sun et al 2019 xu et al 2018a and there was no water logging event during the growing season so the drainage was assumed to be insignificant therefore evapotranspiration et mm was determined using the equation for soil balance chen et al 2019 2 et p i δsws where p and i are total precipitation mm and irrigation mm during each growing season respectively precipitation was recorded at a standard weather station near the plots δsws mm is the cumulative change of sws in 2 m soil depth from sowing to harvest 2 3 3 water use efficiency water use efficiency wue kg m 3 was calculated using the following formula 3 wue y 10 et where y is the grain yield kg ha 1 which were measured from an area of 2 m2 2 sites 1 m in width 1 m in length and 7 2 m2 2 sites 1 2 m in width 3 m in length for winter wheat and summer maize respectively in the middle of each plot at maturity 2 3 4 irrigation and fertilization effects on annual wue of wheat maize system the irrigation effect on annual wue of wheat maize system was defined as the ratio of annual wue of w1 to that of w0 under the same fertilization similarly the fertilization effect on annual wue of wheat maize system was defined as the ratio of annual wue of fertilization treatments fc fc m and fm to that of no fertilization f0 under the same water regime therefore higher and lower than 1 mean positive and negative effects on annual wue of wheat maize system respectively 2 4 statistical analyses statistical analyses were carried out using the data processing system dps software version 7 05 tang and zhang 2013 significant differences between the n fertilization treatments under different water regimes were tested by two way analysis of variance anova in combination with fisher s least significant difference lsd test at a significance level of p 0 05 three way anova was used when considering the years residuals were checked for normality and homogeneity by shapiro and leneve s tests respectively the pearson s correlation coefficients between wue and other parameters were carried out using spss version 21 0 ibm spss software inc armonk ny usa other figures in this paper were potted with sigmaplot version 14 0 systat software inc san jose ca usa 3 results the annual wue of winter wheat and wheat maize system were influenced by year p 0 05 water regime p 0 05 and their interaction p 0 01 the wue of summer maize was year dependent p 0 05 table 1 in other words wheat maize and annual wues varied widely in the three years and water was the main limiting factor for crop production under limited irrigation therefore we distinguished the dry and normal year for winter wheat and summer maize to explain how the precipitation soil water storage sws and evapotranspiration et influenced the wue 3 1 precipitation soil water storage and balance the precipitation during winter wheat growing season was 100 127 and 224 mm in 2015 2016 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 and it was 567 329 and 477 mm during summer maize growing season in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively table s1 the sws in the 200 cm soil depth decreased during the wheat season and increased during the maize season which ranged widely in three years fig 1 specifically the precipitation during the 2017 maize growing season was 148 238 mm lower than those during the other two seasons consequently the 2017 maize season was a typical dry season even though one additional irrigation was applied at 3 days after sowing to ensure seed germination little rainfall before and after sowing lower precipitation in the 2017 maize season also led to less sws for the 2017 2018 wheat season the sws at sowing stage in the 2017 2018 wheat season was only 549 mm it on average was 115 mm lower than those in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 in addition only 8 5 mm rainfall occurred before the wheat jointing stage in 2017 2018 therefore the 2017 2018 wheat season was a typical dry season even though more precipitation occurred during the late growth stage the et of winter wheat was 413 482 mm while the precipitation during the wheat growing season was only 100 127 mm in the normal seasons 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 table 2 consequently 268 311 mm water was from sws including the irrigation before sowing which on average was equal to 65 of the et even though half of the plots were irrigated with 90 mm at the jointing stage of winter wheat correspondingly the wheat et was 354 mm in the dry season 2017 2018 and 24 of et 85 mm was from sws different from winter wheat seasons et of the summer maize was 334 367 mm in the normal seasons 2016 and 2018 and the precipitation during the maize growing season was 477 567 mm table 3 subsequently 142 200 mm water was stored into soil correspondingly the et was 264 mm and only 65 mm was stored into soil in the dry season 2017 3 2 evapotranspiration before and after anthesis the ets before and after anthesis of winter wheat were year dependent p 0 01 table 1 the et before anthesis in dry season 2017 2018 was 171 mm which was 110 122 mm lower than those in normal seasons 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 however the et after anthesis in 2017 2018 was comparable to that in 2016 2017 and 53 higher than that in 2015 2016 table 2 consequently the ratio of et before anthesis to total et in the dry season was 48 which was 18 33 lower than those in the normal seasons the ratio of et after anthesis to total et in dry season was 52 which was 26 81 higher than those of normal seasons the et after anthesis of winter wheat was also influenced by water regime p 0 01 and the interaction between water regime and fertilization strategy p 0 05 table 1 compared with no irrigation during the wheat growing season w0 one additional irrigation at the wheat jointing stage w1 increased wheat et after anthesis on average by 65 mm in three seasons compared with w0 w1 decreased the ratio of et before anthesis to total et by 15 while w1 increased the ratio of et after anthesis to total et on average by 36 in the normal seasons however w1 had little effects on both the ratios of et before and after anthesis to total et in dry season table 2 the et after anthesis of mixed fertilization fc m was lowest with 99 mm under w0 which was 33 lower than that of chemical fertilization fc however the et after anthesis of manure fertilization fm was lowest with 170 mm under w1 it was 16 lower than that of fc table 2 the et before anthesis of summer maize was year dependent p 0 01 table 1 the et before anthesis of summer maize in the dry season 2017 was only 130 mm which was 77 91 mm lower than those in the normal seasons 2016 and 2018 table 3 3 3 water use efficiency 3 3 1 winter wheat the wue of winter wheat in the dry season 2017 2018 was 1 10 kg m 3 which was 29 38 lower than those in the normal seasons 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 fig 2 correspondingly the et of winter wheat in the dry season was 59 128 mm lower than those in the normal seasons table 2 compared with no irrigation during wheat growing season w0 one additional irrigation at the wheat jointing stage w1 had comparable wheat wue in the normal seasons which increased it by 67 in the dry season w1 increased wheat et by 71 mm on average in three seasons compared to w0 compared with chemical fertilization fc manure fertilization fm increased wheat wue by 12 in the normal seasons fig 2 correspondingly fm decreased wheat et by 8 in the normal seasons compared to fc table 2 mixed fertilization fc m had the highest wheat wue under w1 in the dry season which was 20 higher than that of no fertilization f0 3 3 2 summer maize the wue of summer maize in the dry season 2017 was 4 04 kg m 3 which was 17 37 higher than those in the normal seasons 2016 and 2018 seasons fig 3 correspondingly the et of summer maize in the dry season was 71 103 mm lower than those in the normal season table 3 compared with no irrigation during wheat growing season w0 one additional irrigation at the wheat jointing stage w1 had comparable maize wue and it only increased maize et by 17 mm compared with no fertilization f0 manure fertilization fm decreased maize wue on average by 10 in three seasons fig 3 correspondingly fm increased maize et by 17 compared to f0 table 3 3 3 3 winter wheat summer maize system the wue of winter wheat summer maize system annual wue was highest in 2016 2017 with 2 40 kg m 3 which was 7 higher than that in 2017 2018 fig s1 however the annual et in 2016 2017 was 746 mm which is 33 mm lower than that in 2015 2016 and 58 mm higher than that in 2017 2018 compared with no irrigation during wheat growing season w0 one additional irrigation at the wheat jointing stage w1 decreased the annual wue on average by 9 in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 p 0 01 while it increased annual wue by 8 in 2017 2018 p 0 13 fig 4 left w1 increased annual et by 88 mm compared to w0 compared with chemical fertilization fc manure application fc m and fm increased wheat wue by 5 9 fig 2 while it decreased maize wue by 6 10 fig 3 on average in three seasons therefore fertilization strategies had little effect no annual wue fig 4 right 4 discussion 4 1 wheat wue response to irrigation no irrigation during the growing season w0 and one additional irrigation at the jointing stage w1 are two optimal limited irrigation practices under adequate soil moisture condition before sowing for winter wheat production in the north china plain han et al 2017 xu et al 2016 w1 maintained wheat wue in the normal seasons and increased it in the dry season compared to w0 qiu et al 2008 li et al 2015 xu et al 2016 2018b this was mainly due to great improvement of wheat yield in the dry years led by irrigation resulting in higher yield per unit of water used wheat wue was negatively correlated with et and independent with yield in the normal seasons while it was positively correlated with et and yield in the dry season even though the wheat yield was positively correlated with et in both the normal and dry seasons the yield per unit of et i e the slope of linear regression equation between yield and et in the dry season was threefold of that in the normal season fig 5 therefore maintaining an optimal water supply in the soil through irrigation is the key to increasing wue and here one additional irrigation was applied at the wheat jointing stage in the dry season the optimal et with the highest wue was 447 482 mm for winter wheat wang et al 2001 zhang et al 2004 however the wheat wue was not only affected by the amount of et sun et al 2006 wang et al 2018b but also the distribution of et before and after anthesis sun et al 2010 li et al 2018 2019 et after anthesis was usually thought to be more important than et before anthesis due to higher et after anthesis was synchronized with dry matter accumulation after anthesis and further increased grain yield and wue wang et al 2015 li et al 2018 2019 different from previous studies we found wheat wue was positively correlated with the ratio of et before anthesis under limited irrigation table s6 et before anthesis is necessary for higher dry matter accumulation before anthesis which is an important controlling factor for grain number per unit of area foulkes et al 2011 and aboveground biomass xue et al 2006 xu et al 2018a this was also supported by the positive correlations between et before anthesis and yield yield components spike number per unit of area grain number per spike and 1000 grain weight as well as aboveground biomass table s6 these results partly explained that 1 the wheat et in the dry season was 14 27 lower than those in the normal seasons while the wheat wue was decreased by 29 38 higher decrease percentage of wue than that of et in the dry season was caused by lower ratio of et before anthesis while higher ratio of et after anthesis to total et 2 compared with w0 w1 had comparable wue in the normal seasons while increased wheat wue in the dry season due to higher increase percentage of et before anthesis led by w1 efficient use of soil water storage sws is the key to increase wheat wue during a dry season zhang et al 2004 supported by the positive correlations between cumulative changes of sws δsws and yield wue table s6 sws at the sowing stage of wheat is crucial for higher et before anthesis supported by the positive correlation between each other table s6 in addition sws at the sowing stage was positively correlated with grain yield yield components and wue table s6 these results corroborate the idea that sws conditions at the sowing stage determined the grain yield and wue of winter wheat even under growing seasons of lower precipitation or limited irrigation kang et al 2002 debaeke and aboudrare 2004 4 2 wheat wue response to fertilization overall manure application resulted in a higher wue than chemical fertilization fc for winter wheat due to lower et which is different from other results that manure application increased wue because of higher yield li et al 2010b xia et al 2017 the yield from manure application was similar to that from fc due to limited water supply olesen et al 2000 albrizio et al 2010 wang et al 2020 however manure application fc m and fm resulted in lower et mainly after anthesis by 10 14 table 2 which was led by comparable water content at the sowing and anthesis stages while relatively higher water content of manure application than that of fc at the maturity stage fig 6 the long term incorporation of manure into soil can lower bulk density table s7 which had the potential to increase wilting point and field capacity as well as alter soil hydrological properties through increasing soil micropores and specific surface area dhaliwal et al 2019 in addition manure incorporation decreased root biomass by up to 40 without any reduction in shoot growth especially in the deep soil layer espinosa et al 2011 less root together with higher wilting point decreased the et after anthesis remarkably the less et after anthesis didn t result in yield losses which was supported by no significant relationship between et after anthesis and yield table s6 thus manure application maintained wheat yield and decreased et subsequently increased wue 4 3 maize wue response to previous water management in wheat season the wue of summer maize in the dry season was up to 4 04 kg m 3 which reached to the boundary function for maize wue in the northern china 3 68 4 25 kg m 3 zheng et al 2020 given that the yield of summer maize was not water limited due to adequate precipitation higher et usually decreased wue which was supported by the negative correlation between maize wue and et in both normal and dry seasons table s8 more consumption of sws in the wheat season usually led to lower sws for subsequent maize resulted in decreased maize et before anthesis and consequently increased maize wue these results were supported by the negative correlations between wue and et before anthesis sws at maize sowing stage in the dry season table s8 efficient use of sws in the wheat season also led to high amounts of straw mulched in the maize season which could decrease the soil evaporation of summer maize gao et al 2019 zhang et al 2002 especially during the early growing periods zhang et al 2013 this was confirmed by the negative correlation between residue amount of previous wheat and et before anthesis of summer maize fig s2 these results indicated that maize wue can be further improved by decreasing et before anthesis through enhancing the wheat consumption for sws which is also a strategy for increasing wheat yield and wue 4 4 maize wue response to fertilization mixed fertilization fc m combined with good water supply usually had higher wue wang et al 2016 due to greater yield advantages wang et al 2020 xia et al 2017 this was also supported by the positive correlation between maize wue and yield in normal years table s8 however manure application fc m and fm increased maize et before anthesis by 7 14 compared to chemical fertilization fc table 3 for summer maize the percentage of soil evaporation to total et was reached to 85 at the sowing stage and it decreased with the growth process moving forward zhang et al 2013 therefore the relatively higher amounts of sws led by manure application fc m and fm in wheat season was compensated by more soil evaporation before anthesis in maize season which was supported by the similar soil water contents between different fertilizations at the anthesis stage of summer maize fig 6 overall manure application fc m and fm had a trend to decrease maize wue due to the higher amount of et before anthesis 5 conclusion our findings confirmed that the replacement of mineral nitrogen n with manure can increase the water use efficiency wue of winter wheat and maintain the annual wue of the wheat maize system under water limited conditions compared with no irrigation during the wheat growing season w0 one irrigation at the wheat jointing stage w1 had no effect on wheat wue in the normal season but increased wheat wue by 67 in the dry season w1 had a rare effect on the evapotranspiration et and wue of summer maize compared to w0 overall this irrigation decreased the annual wue of wheat maize system by 9 in the wheat normal year while increased it by 8 in the wheat dry year mixed and manure fertilization fc m and fm increased wheat wue by 5 9 but decreased maize wue by 6 10 compared with chemical fertilization fc therefore the fertilization strategy had a minor effect on the annual wue of wheat maize system in conclusion the replacement of mineral n with manure under limited irrigation provides a better fertilization strategy to increase wheat wue and maintain the annual wue of wheat maize system this practice has the potential to relieve the regional water deficit for sustainable agriculture production in the north china plain declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this study was supported by the special fund for agro scientific research

total fresh water volume in china is 2 81 1012 m3 ranking 6th in the world however the water resource per capita in china is only one fourth of the world average piao et al 2010 and distributes

not only the amount and regional distribution of water resource but also the seasonal distribution of rainfall limits agricultural production given that winter wheat summer maize is the main cropping

fertilizers in the crop production system bouwman et al 2013 which help to enhance nutrient use efficiency with lower environment impacts the effects of irrigation regime or manure application on the wue of winter wheat have been separately evaluated in previous investigations xu et al 2016 wang et al 2017 however few trials focused on the effect of manure application on wue of the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system under seasonal water deficit thus we aimed to 1 evaluate the influence of manure application on wheat wue under limited irrigation 2 estimate the effects of water management in wheat season on wue of maize following wheat and 3 synthesize knowledge about yield evapotranspiration soil water storage rainfall and irrigation to explain the effects of irrigation and fertilization strategies on wue of winter wheat and summer maize 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site a field experiment was carried out from october 2015 to october 2018 at the wuqiao experimental station of china agricultural university 37 41 n 116 36 e in cangzhou city hebei province this region has a typical sub humid continental monsoon climate with a cold winter and a hot summer the heating degree days of winter wheat 0 c and summer maize 8 c are 1800 and 1900 c respectively and the annual frost free period is 201 days zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 the long term average annual rainfall is 562 mm with a sharp seasonal fluctuation and erratic seasonal distribution wang et al 2018a the monthly precipitation air temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed and reference crop evapotranspiration during the experiment are showed in table s1 the soil at the experimental site is loamy mollisols that developed on an alluvial plain the initial characteristics of the 0 20 cm soil layer were as follows soil organic carbon k2cr2o7 oxidation reduction titration method 9 0 g kg 1 total nitrogen kjeldahl digestion method 1 3 g kg 1 total phosphorus mo sb anti spectrophotometric method 1 73 g kg 1 available phosphorous olsen p 89 8 mg kg 1 and soil ph 2 5 1 water to soil ratio v w 7 74 the bulk density field capacity and wilting point in a 200 cm soil depth at the site were presented in table s2 2 2 experimental design and set up in order to investigate the effects of manure application on wue of winter wheat triticum aestivum l cv jimai 22 and summer maize zea mays l cv zhengdan 958 under limited irrigation within a wheat maize double cropping system a fixed field experiment was conducted with combinations of two irrigation treatments and four fertilization treatments the experiment was arranged as a split spot design with three replicates for each treatment and the plot size was 100 m2 10 m 10 m the main plots were two water regimes w1 irrigated once at the jointing stage of winter wheat 90 mm and w0 no irrigation during the whole wheat growing season there was a 2 m buffer to separate the treatments under two water regimes all the treatments received a depth of 90 mm irrigation controlled by flow meter by surface irrigation with a 4 inch plastic coated hose before wheat sowing the effect of water management during wheat season on maize wue was also evaluated the sub plots were four n fertilization treatments f0 no fertilizer fc 100 chemical fertilizer n fc m 50 chemical fertilizer n 50 manure and fm 100 manure fc was fertilized with 157 5 kg n ha 1 60 3 kg p ha 1 and 93 4 kg k ha 1 for winter wheat and 178 5 kg n ha 1 45 2 kg p ha 1 and 93 4 kg k ha 1 for summer maize table s3 the chemical fertilizers were applied in the form of urea diammonium phosphate and potassium sulfate the water content and nutrient composition of the applied manure during the different crop growing seasons was shown in table s4 the applied amounts of manure for fc m fm were determined based on the n inputs their averages were 21 7 43 4 mg ha 1 for winter wheat and 23 7 47 5 mg ha 1 for summer maize respectively the rest n p and k were applied with chemical fertilizers to match the same application rate of n p and k with fc superphosphate was used to match the same amount of p for fc m and fm the same amount of applied manure n led to much more k amount for fc m and fm except fc m in the 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 wheat seasons rotary tillage with residue incorporation was performed for winter wheat and no till with residue mulching was done for summer maize respectively all the manure and chemical fertilizers were surface broadcast as basal fertilizer for winter wheat before rotary tillage 15 cm depth for summer maize 100 of manure chemical fertilizer p chemical fertilizer k and 26 of chemical fertilizer n were applied at the trefoil stage after ditching 15 cm depth and 10 cm width in the middle of plant rows and the rest of chemical fertilizer n 74 was fertilized as topdressing at flare opening stage before rainfall table s3 florasulam and imidacloprid were sprayed for winter wheat to prevent descurainia sophia and aphidoidea at returning green and anthesis stages respectively nicosulfuron and imidacloprid were sprayed for summer maize to control weeds and pests at 4th leaf v4 and 5th leaf v5 stages respectively winter wheat was sown with a 15 cm row spacing summer maize was sown with a 60 cm row spacing and a 24 cm plant distance in a row the amounts of seed and irrigation water and the date of sowing harvest and fertilization were also recorded in this experiment table s5 2 3 sampling and analytical procedures 2 3 1 soil water storage soil moisture was determined at sowing pre winter erecting jointing anthesis grain filling and harvest stages in the wheat growing season and at sowing jointing flare opening anthesis grain filling and harvest stages in the maize growing seasons using the oven drying method fig 1 soil moisture was also measured 2 3 days after irrigation and heavy rainfall soil samples were taken from 0 to 200 cm at 20 cm intervals by a ground auger and dried at 105 c to a constant weight with three replicates the soil water storage sws mm was calculated as follows 1 sws swc ρb sd where swc is the soil water content ρb g cm 3 is soil bulk density and sd mm is soil depth 2 3 2 evapotranspiration the field experiment was conducted under limited irrigation 90 180 mm for winter wheat and 0 90 mm for summer maize and plots between water regimes were separated with 2 m buffer hence the occurrence of surface runoff can be prevented across the growing season the groundwater table has declined to nearly 30 50 m below the surface government information opening platform of cang zhou 2015 so the upward flow into the root zone was negligible the water contents below the 200 cm soil layer were identical sun et al 2019 xu et al 2018a and there was no water logging event during the growing season so the drainage was assumed to be insignificant therefore evapotranspiration et mm was determined using the equation for soil balance chen et al 2019 2 et p i δsws where p and i are total precipitation mm and irrigation mm during each growing season respectively precipitation was recorded at a standard weather station near the plots δsws mm is the cumulative change of sws in 2 m soil depth from sowing to harvest 2 3 3 water use efficiency water use efficiency wue kg m 3 was calculated using the following formula 3 wue y 10 et where y is the grain yield kg ha 1 which were measured from an area of 2 m2 2 sites 1 m in width 1 m in length and 7 2 m2 2 sites 1 2 m in width 3 m in length for winter wheat and summer maize respectively in the middle of each plot at maturity 2 3 4 irrigation and fertilization effects on annual wue of wheat maize system the irrigation effect on annual wue of wheat maize system was defined as the ratio of annual wue of w1 to that of w0 under the same fertilization similarly the fertilization effect on annual wue of wheat maize system was defined as the ratio of annual wue of fertilization treatments fc fc m and fm to that of no fertilization f0 under the same water regime therefore higher and lower than 1 mean positive and negative effects on annual wue of wheat maize system respectively 2 4 statistical analyses statistical analyses were carried out using the data processing system dps software version 7 05 tang and zhang 2013 significant differences between the n fertilization treatments under different water regimes were tested by two way analysis of variance anova in combination with fisher s least significant difference lsd test at a significance level of p 0 05 three way anova was used when considering the years residuals were checked for normality and homogeneity by shapiro and leneve s tests respectively the pearson s correlation coefficients between wue and other parameters were carried out using spss version 21 0 ibm spss software inc armonk ny usa other figures in this paper were potted with sigmaplot version 14 0 systat software inc san jose ca usa 3 results the annual wue of winter wheat and wheat maize system were influenced by year p 0 05 water regime p 0 05 and their interaction p 0 01 the wue of summer maize was year dependent p 0 05 table 1 in other words wheat maize and annual wues varied widely in the three years and water was the main limiting factor for crop production under limited irrigation therefore we distinguished the dry and normal year for winter wheat and summer maize to explain how the precipitation soil water storage sws and evapotranspiration et influenced the wue 3 1 precipitation soil water storage and balance the precipitation during winter wheat growing season was 100 127 and 224 mm in 2015 2016 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 and it was 567 329 and 477 mm during summer maize growing season in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively table s1 the sws in the 200 cm soil depth decreased during the wheat season and increased during the maize season which ranged widely in three years fig 1 specifically the precipitation during the 2017 maize growing season was 148 238 mm lower than those during the other two seasons consequently the 2017 maize season was a typical dry season even though one additional irrigation was applied at 3 days after sowing to ensure seed germination little rainfall before and after sowing lower precipitation in the 2017 maize season also led to less sws for the 2017 2018 wheat season the sws at sowing stage in the 2017 2018 wheat season was only 549 mm it on average was 115 mm lower than those in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 in addition only 8 5 mm rainfall occurred before the wheat jointing stage in 2017 2018 therefore the 2017 2018 wheat season was a typical dry season even though more precipitation occurred during the late growth stage the et of winter wheat was 413 482 mm while the precipitation during the wheat growing season was only 100 127 mm in the normal seasons 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 table 2 consequently 268 311 mm water was from sws including the irrigation before sowing which on average was equal to 65 of the et even though half of the plots were irrigated with 90 mm at the jointing stage of winter wheat correspondingly the wheat et was 354 mm in the dry season 2017 2018 and 24 of et 85 mm was from sws different from winter wheat seasons et of the summer maize was 334 367 mm in the normal seasons 2016 and 2018 and the precipitation during the maize growing season was 477 567 mm table 3 subsequently 142 200 mm water was stored into soil correspondingly the et was 264 mm and only 65 mm was stored into soil in the dry season 2017 3 2 evapotranspiration before and after anthesis the ets before and after anthesis of winter wheat were year dependent p 0 01 table 1 the et before anthesis in dry season 2017 2018 was 171 mm which was 110 122 mm lower than those in normal seasons 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 however the et after anthesis in 2017 2018 was comparable to that in 2016 2017 and 53 higher than that in 2015 2016 table 2 consequently the ratio of et before anthesis to total et in the dry season was 48 which was 18 33 lower than those in the normal seasons the ratio of et after anthesis to total et in dry season was 52 which was 26 81 higher than those of normal seasons the et after anthesis of winter wheat was also influenced by water regime p 0 01 and the interaction between water regime and fertilization strategy p 0 05 table 1 compared with no irrigation during the wheat growing season w0 one additional irrigation at the wheat jointing stage w1 increased wheat et after anthesis on average by 65 mm in three seasons compared with w0 w1 decreased the ratio of et before anthesis to total et by 15 while w1 increased the ratio of et after anthesis to total et on average by 36 in the normal seasons however w1 had little effects on both the ratios of et before and after anthesis to total et in dry season table 2 the et after anthesis of mixed fertilization fc m was lowest with 99 mm under w0 which was 33 lower than that of chemical fertilization fc however the et after anthesis of manure fertilization fm was lowest with 170 mm under w1 it was 16 lower than that of fc table 2 the et before anthesis of summer maize was year dependent p 0 01 table 1 the et before anthesis of summer maize in the dry season 2017 was only 130 mm which was 77 91 mm lower than those in the normal seasons 2016 and 2018 table 3 3 3 water use efficiency 3 3 1 winter wheat the wue of winter wheat in the dry season 2017 2018 was 1 10 kg m 3 which was 29 38 lower than those in the normal seasons 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 fig 2 correspondingly the et of winter wheat in the dry season was 59 128 mm lower than those in the normal seasons table 2 compared with no irrigation during wheat growing season w0 one additional irrigation at the wheat jointing stage w1 had comparable wheat wue in the normal seasons which increased it by 67 in the dry season w1 increased wheat et by 71 mm on average in three seasons compared to w0 compared with chemical fertilization fc manure fertilization fm increased wheat wue by 12 in the normal seasons fig 2 correspondingly fm decreased wheat et by 8 in the normal seasons compared to fc table 2 mixed fertilization fc m had the highest wheat wue under w1 in the dry season which was 20 higher than that of no fertilization f0 3 3 2 summer maize the wue of summer maize in the dry season 2017 was 4 04 kg m 3 which was 17 37 higher than those in the normal seasons 2016 and 2018 seasons fig 3 correspondingly the et of summer maize in the dry season was 71 103 mm lower than those in the normal season table 3 compared with no irrigation during wheat growing season w0 one additional irrigation at the wheat jointing stage w1 had comparable maize wue and it only increased maize et by 17 mm compared with no fertilization f0 manure fertilization fm decreased maize wue on average by 10 in three seasons fig 3 correspondingly fm increased maize et by 17 compared to f0 table 3 3 3 3 winter wheat summer maize system the wue of winter wheat summer maize system annual wue was highest in 2016 2017 with 2 40 kg m 3 which was 7 higher than that in 2017 2018 fig s1 however the annual et in 2016 2017 was 746 mm which is 33 mm lower than that in 2015 2016 and 58 mm higher than that in 2017 2018 compared with no irrigation during wheat growing season w0 one additional irrigation at the wheat jointing stage w1 decreased the annual wue on average by 9 in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 p 0 01 while it increased annual wue by 8 in 2017 2018 p 0 13 fig 4 left w1 increased annual et by 88 mm compared to w0 compared with chemical fertilization fc manure application fc m and fm increased wheat wue by 5 9 fig 2 while it decreased maize wue by 6 10 fig 3 on average in three seasons therefore fertilization strategies had little effect no annual wue fig 4 right 4 discussion 4 1 wheat wue response to irrigation no irrigation during the growing season w0 and one additional irrigation at the jointing stage w1 are two optimal limited irrigation practices under adequate soil moisture condition before sowing for winter wheat production in the north china plain han et al 2017 xu et al 2016 w1 maintained wheat wue in the normal seasons and increased it in the dry season compared to w0 qiu et al 2008 li et al 2015 xu et al 2016 2018b this was mainly due to great improvement of wheat yield in the dry years led by irrigation resulting in higher yield per unit of water used wheat wue was negatively correlated with et and independent with yield in the normal seasons while it was positively correlated with et and yield in the dry season even though the wheat yield was positively correlated with et in both the normal and dry seasons the yield per unit of et i e the slope of linear regression equation between yield and et in the dry season was threefold of that in the normal season fig 5 therefore maintaining an optimal water supply in the soil through irrigation is the key to increasing wue and here one additional irrigation was applied at the wheat jointing stage in the dry season the optimal et with the highest wue was 447 482 mm for winter wheat wang et al 2001 zhang et al 2004 however the wheat wue was not only affected by the amount of et sun et al 2006 wang et al 2018b but also the distribution of et before and after anthesis sun et al 2010 li et al 2018 2019 et after anthesis was usually thought to be more important than et before anthesis due to higher et after anthesis was synchronized with dry matter accumulation after anthesis and further increased grain yield and wue wang et al 2015 li et al 2018 2019 different from previous studies we found wheat wue was positively correlated with the ratio of et before anthesis under limited irrigation table s6 et before anthesis is necessary for higher dry matter accumulation before anthesis which is an important controlling factor for grain number per unit of area foulkes et al 2011 and aboveground biomass xue et al 2006 xu et al 2018a this was also supported by the positive correlations between et before anthesis and yield yield components spike number per unit of area grain number per spike and 1000 grain weight as well as aboveground biomass table s6 these results partly explained that 1 the wheat et in the dry season was 14 27 lower than those in the normal seasons while the wheat wue was decreased by 29 38 higher decrease percentage of wue than that of et in the dry season was caused by lower ratio of et before anthesis while higher ratio of et after anthesis to total et 2 compared with w0 w1 had comparable wue in the normal seasons while increased wheat wue in the dry season due to higher increase percentage of et before anthesis led by w1 efficient use of soil water storage sws is the key to increase wheat wue during a dry season zhang et al 2004 supported by the positive correlations between cumulative changes of sws δsws and yield wue table s6 sws at the sowing stage of wheat is crucial for higher et before anthesis supported by the positive correlation between each other table s6 in addition sws at the sowing stage was positively correlated with grain yield yield components and wue table s6 these results corroborate the idea that sws conditions at the sowing stage determined the grain yield and wue of winter wheat even under growing seasons of lower precipitation or limited irrigation kang et al 2002 debaeke and aboudrare 2004 4 2 wheat wue response to fertilization overall manure application resulted in a higher wue than chemical fertilization fc for winter wheat due to lower et which is different from other results that manure application increased wue because of higher yield li et al 2010b xia et al 2017 the yield from manure application was similar to that from fc due to limited water supply olesen et al 2000 albrizio et al 2010 wang et al 2020 however manure application fc m and fm resulted in lower et mainly after anthesis by 10 14 table 2 which was led by comparable water content at the sowing and anthesis stages while relatively higher water content of manure application than that of fc at the maturity stage fig 6 the long term incorporation of manure into soil can lower bulk density table s7 which had the potential to increase wilting point and field capacity as well as alter soil hydrological properties through increasing soil micropores and specific surface area dhaliwal et al 2019 in addition manure incorporation decreased root biomass by up to 40 without any reduction in shoot growth especially in the deep soil layer espinosa et al 2011 less root together with higher wilting point decreased the et after anthesis remarkably the less et after anthesis didn t result in yield losses which was supported by no significant relationship between et after anthesis and yield table s6 thus manure application maintained wheat yield and decreased et subsequently increased wue 4 3 maize wue response to previous water management in wheat season the wue of summer maize in the dry season was up to 4 04 kg m 3 which reached to the boundary function for maize wue in the northern china 3 68 4 25 kg m 3 zheng et al 2020 given that the yield of summer maize was not water limited due to adequate precipitation higher et usually decreased wue which was supported by the negative correlation between maize wue and et in both normal and dry seasons table s8 more consumption of sws in the wheat season usually led to lower sws for subsequent maize resulted in decreased maize et before anthesis and consequently increased maize wue these results were supported by the negative correlations between wue and et before anthesis sws at maize sowing stage in the dry season table s8 efficient use of sws in the wheat season also led to high amounts of straw mulched in the maize season which could decrease the soil evaporation of summer maize gao et al 2019 zhang et al 2002 especially during the early growing periods zhang et al 2013 this was confirmed by the negative correlation between residue amount of previous wheat and et before anthesis of summer maize fig s2 these results indicated that maize wue can be further improved by decreasing et before anthesis through enhancing the wheat consumption for sws which is also a strategy for increasing wheat yield and wue 4 4 maize wue response to fertilization mixed fertilization fc m combined with good water supply usually had higher wue wang et al 2016 due to greater yield advantages wang et al 2020 xia et al 2017 this was also supported by the positive correlation between maize wue and yield in normal years table s8 however manure application fc m and fm increased maize et before anthesis by 7 14 compared to chemical fertilization fc table 3 for summer maize the percentage of soil evaporation to total et was reached to 85 at the sowing stage and it decreased with the growth process moving forward zhang et al 2013 therefore the relatively higher amounts of sws led by manure application fc m and fm in wheat season was compensated by more soil evaporation before anthesis in maize season which was supported by the similar soil water contents between different fertilizations at the anthesis stage of summer maize fig 6 overall manure application fc m and fm had a trend to decrease maize wue due to the higher amount of et before anthesis 5 conclusion our findings confirmed that the replacement of mineral nitrogen n with manure can increase the water use efficiency wue of winter wheat and maintain the annual wue of the wheat maize system under water limited conditions compared with no irrigation during the wheat growing season w0 one irrigation at the wheat jointing stage w1 had no effect on wheat wue in the normal season but increased wheat wue by 67 in the dry season w1 had a rare effect on the evapotranspiration et and wue of summer maize compared to w0 overall this irrigation decreased the annual wue of wheat maize system by 9 in the wheat normal year while increased it by 8 in the wheat dry year mixed and manure fertilization fc m and fm increased wheat wue by 5 9 but decreased maize wue by 6 10 compared with chemical fertilization fc therefore the fertilization strategy had a minor effect on the annual wue of wheat maize system in conclusion the replacement of mineral n with manure under limited irrigation provides a better fertilization strategy to increase wheat wue and maintain the annual wue of wheat maize system this practice has the potential to relieve the regional water deficit for sustainable agriculture production in the north china plain declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this study was supported by the special fund for agro scientific research

10367,a subsurface irrigation system with ceramic emitters sice without a pump has been developed to limit energy consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions yet whether sice can be used in low pressure conditions has not been tested moreover there is no index for evaluating the irrigation quality of sice laboratory experiments with six treatments were conducted to study ceramic emitter hydraulic characteristics in the air and soil under different working pressure heads and emitter types the results indicated that when h increased the emitter discharge increased linearly and the discharge deviation decreased in the air with increased h in the soil the emitter discharge soil water content and soil water content uniformity increased and the discharge deviation decreased when h was greater than or equal to 20 cm the discharge deviation in the soil was less than that in the air and the soil water content uniformity was higher than 80 the soil water content uniformity could be used in the evaluation of the irrigation quality of sice based on the reliability and convenience of observation to make the best use of soil water potential on the outflow of the emitter reduce the discharge deviation and improve soil water content uniformity the working pressure head of sice should be higher than 20 cm keywords uniformity irrigation quality emitter subsurface irrigation discharge 1 introduction water saving irrigation technology could improve crop yields and reduce labor intensity but it also requires high energy inputs and may cause environmental problems adu et al 2019 sampson and perry 2019 s wang et al 2019 w wang et al 2019 kaltsas et al 2007 reported that irrigation energy demand accounted for approximately 21 of the total energy consumption in conventional olive orchards todde et al 2019 found that the application of photovoltaic irrigation systems would decrease energy consumption 41 and 67 in morocco and portugal and avoid the emission of large amounts of greenhouse gases romero gamez et al 2017 showed that the greatest environmental impact was from an intensively irrigated integrated system and a super intensive irrigated integrated system because of the electricity consumed during irrigation pumps consume most of the electricity in irrigation systems powell et al 2019 to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions an irrigation system that requires a lower working pressure head h and can function without a pump would benefit the industry pitcher or pot irrigation is a traditional irrigation method used to supply water to crops without external inputs such as oil and electricity under drought conditions in arid regions for which h is usually lower than 20 cm paredes and san jose 2019 siyal et al 2009 singh and ghosal 2015 argued that the interaction of pitcher fertigation brought a 106 9 and 13 5 increase in lac crop yield ratio of ber ziziphus mauritiana in summer and winter respectively pachpute 2010 used a suite of water management practices including a pitcher irrigation method as well as water conservation techniques of manure application and mulching in north eastern tanzania that led to an increase 203 in total cucumber yield batchelor et al 1996 found that subsurface irrigation with clay pipes was particularly effective in improving yields crop quality and water use efficiency as well as being inexpensive simple and easy to use in southeast zimbabwe and northern sri lanka however irrigation of crops with pitchers or ceramic tubes is seldom scaled up in modern field conditions bainbridge 2001 one problem is that pitchers are difficult to connect to large scale irrigation systems pachpute 2010 the other is that discharges and manufacturing deviations of devices are difficult to precisely control hajjaji and mezouari 2011 naik et al 2013 therefore to meet modern irrigation requirements optimized pitcher structures and material properties are needed a subsurface irrigation system with ceramic emitters sice recently has been developed cai et al 2017 most of the components of sice are similar to a subsurface drip irrigation system sdi camp 1998 lamm and trooien 2003 it eliminates the need for pumps as irrigation water is supplied by a water tank of constant pressure such a sice works with low pressure small discharge and continuously which would maintain a suitable root zone and soil water content thus maintaining water availability to plants lazarovitch et al 2006 the h of a ceramic emitter is usually smaller than 100 cm and it can be close to zero or negative ashrafi et al 2002 li et al 2019 found that negative pressure water supply not only maintained a high fruit yield but also significantly increased water use efficiency nalliah and ranjan 2010 stated that a capillary irrigation technique with porous membranes with different negative pressures offered precise water delivery with minimal labor requirements suitable for use in greenhouse pepper production however in field environments the conditions in which an h of zero or negative seldom occur unless there is a special water supply to provide water for the emitter li et al 2017 cai et al 2018 suggested that the h of ceramic emitter should be higher than 20 cm under field conditions to reduce system costs yet this conclusion was just assumed based on previous observations therefore a critical question remains can a sice be used with h lower than 20 cm in a sice ceramic emitters are used in place of traditional plastic emitters there are many advantages of ceramic emitters over pitchers such as controllable emitter discharge and environmental safety cai et al 2017 however large manufacturing deviations are a prominent feature of ceramic products to reduce manufacturing deviations of ceramics researchers have adopted various methods such as droplet jetting slurry curing procedures cai et al 2019a and frozen slurry based laminated object manufacturing processes zhang et al 2018 however in most developing countries it is difficult to prepare ceramic emitters pitchers pots with low manufacturing deviation because ceramic emitters are typically made by hand siyal et al 2009 vasudevan et al 2011 much of the research on the performance of sdi systems in the last two decades has focused on how the interaction between the effects of emitter discharge and soil properties could affect irrigation uniformity lazarovitch et al 2006 gil et al 2008 found that irrigation uniformity of sdi non compensating emitters to be greater than surface drip irrigation due to the interaction between the effects of emitter discharge and soil pressure ren et al 2017 stated that the greater the initial water content soil bulk density and mass fractal dimension the smaller the deviation rate of lateral flow of an sdi the emitter discharge exponent of the ceramic emitter in the sice system is 1 and thus it is a non compensating emitter asabe 2006 cai et al 2019b however the h and discharge of sice are lower than for sdi as such can soil properties affect irrigation uniformity of sice especially for ceramic emitters with large manufacturing deviations the present study aimed to 1 compare emitter discharge and discharge deviations in the air and soils under different h and emitter types 2 select a suitable indicator for evaluating irrigation quality of sice and 3 identify a working pressure head for sice 2 materials and methods 2 1 emitter hydraulic characteristics in the air 2 1 1 experimental setup the experiment setup had eight major components water tank pump manometer branch lateral ceramic emitters beakers and manometer fig 1 five ceramic emitters were installed on one lateral and the emitter spacing was 0 20 m five laterals were connected by a branch total emitter n 25 and the branch was fed by the water tank and pump the emitter discharge under different h was observed and recorded emitter discharge was measured by the weighing method and taken as the average of 25 replicates the irrigation water used in the experiment was urban domestic water from yangling and the water temperature during the test was 20 3 c in the experiment ceramic emitters with two different porosities were employed which were denoted as ce1 and ce2 the ceramic emitters were made of silica talc and silica sol and then sintered in a tunnel furnace the porosity of the ceramic emitters was controlled by altering the grain size of the silica the external diameter internal diameter inner hole depth and height of ceramic emitters were 39 37 mm 19 82 mm 4 97 mm and 6 80 mm respectively the open porosity of ce1 and ce2 were 0 36 and 0 28 respectively 2 1 2 calculated method flow velocity of the fluid through the porous materials can be calculated by obtaining the relation between the pressure drop and hydraulic conductivity of the porous materials wu et al 2018 as the ceramic emitters are made of porous ceramics and we assume that the ceramic emitter is always saturated during irrigation therefore laminar flow occurs in the pore and darcy s law which describes a linear relationship between pressure gradient and the fluid velocity is reliable li et al 2019a 2019b 1 v q a k d h d l where d h d l is the pressure gradient along the fluid direction v is the fluid velocity calculated by the emitter discharge divided by seepage area k is the emitter hydraulic conductivity q is emitter discharge a is emitter seepage area for the fluid that cannot be compressed the pressure gradient can be calculated as 2 d h d l h in h out l where h in is the pressure of water at the ceramic emitter entrance and in most cases h in is equal to the working pressure h w h out is the pressure of water at the ceramic emitter exit when the ceramic emitter is working in air h out 0 l is the seepage tracking therefore the emitter discharge in air could be expressed as 3 q k a h w l however for some types of porous media with small pore size such as fine grained soil sandstones fluids can flow through these porous media only if the fluid force is sufficient to overcome the threshold pressure gradient wang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 min et al 2018 liu and birkholzer 2012 prada and civan 1999 studied the permeability of saturated brine in eight typical sandstones and brown sandstones and found the permeation of saturated brine was not consistent with darcy s law there was an initial pressure gradient which is the function of the permeability of pore medium and the viscosity coefficient of the fluid therefore eq 3 would be 4 q k a h w h i l where h i l is initial pressure gradient for ceramic emitter the emitter discharge would not be negative value and for a certain porous medium the initial pressure h i is constant value therefore eq 4 would be 5 q 0 h w h i q k h w h i a l k h w a l i k h w a l c h w h i where i and c are constant values for a ceramic emitter for which structure parameters and ceramic characteristics are fixed values the emitter seepage area a seepage tracking l and hydraulic conductivity k are constants and therefore eq 5 can be re written as 6 q 0 h w h i q k h w c h w h i where k is the emitter discharge coefficient due to various factors such as manufacturing specific processes and material deformation the emitter will inevitably produce deviations in the present experiments the lateral length was just 2 m the discharge deviation caused by hydraulic deviation was negligible so the emitter discharge variation in the air would be equal to the emitter manufacturing variation the calculation of manufacturing variation cvm is given in eq 7 7 c v m 1 n 1 q x q 2 q 2 where qx is the xth emitter discharge in the air q is average emitter discharge under the same h and n is the total number of emitters 25 the evaluation standards of cvm listed by the american society of agricultural and biological engineers are shown in table 1 2 2 emitter hydraulic characteristics in the soil 2 2 1 experimental setup the experiment setup had eight major components constant pressure water tank pressure sensors laterals intake microtubules drainage microtubules ceramic emitters soil pots and balance fig 2 the laboratory experiments were performed in five soil pots volume 17 24 l made of plastic with the pot spacing 35 cm ceramic emitters were fed by the constant pressure water tank in each pot only one ceramic emitter was installed at a depth of 15 cm and it was connected to the lateral with a 4 mm rubber intake microtubule at the beginning of the experiment a rubber drainage microtubule was connected to the headcover of the ceramic emitter to exhaust air in the lateral and microtubule 2 2 2 soil sample after sieving using a 2 mm mesh sieve the air dried soil with an average soil bulk density of 1 3 g cm 3 was used to fill the soil tank clay loam 33 1 clay 26 8 silt and 40 1 sand usda soil taxonomy was selected for the study the procedure for filling the pots was first to feed the ceramic emitter and rubber pipe through the right side and the loading and compaction 5 cm layers of soil to each pot to avoid soil stratification the upper surface of each layer was ensured to be sufficiently rough the cumulative infiltration of the emitter was obtained by weighing the soil pot at intervals of 10 min for the first 1 h and then at intervals of 30 min for the last 5 h the cumulative infiltration of the ceramic emitter may be affected by various parameters but experiments were implemented specifically to study the effect of h and emitter type on emitter infiltration characteristics of the soil the input data of experiments are listed in table 2 2 2 3 calculated method the relationship between cumulative infiltration and time can be described by a power function su et al 2016 8 i a t b c where i is the cumulative infiltration at time t and a b and c are the coefficients therefore the emitter discharge in the soil or infiltration rate could be obtained by eq 7 9 q i d i d t a b t b 1 system uniformity is ordinarily defined in terms of the variation of q from emitter to emitter and the coefficient of variation cvq of emitters buried in the soil can also be calculated by eq 5 when ceramic emitters are buried in the soil emitter discharge is not easily measured and thus system uniformity is difficult to calculate therefore soil water content uniformity may be much easier to observe than that of emitter discharge christiansen soil water content uniformity cuθ may be expressed by christiansen 1941 10 c u θ 1 1 n x 1 n θ x θ θ where θx is the xth soil water content in the soil pot and θ is the average soil water content of a total of 5 pots the evaluation standards of cuθ listed by the american society of agricultural and biological engineers are shown in table 3 3 results 3 1 emitter hydraulic characteristics in the air 3 1 1 emitter discharge in the air fig 3 shows the emitter discharge at different h in the air a linear relationship is observed between the emitter discharge and h for example as h increases from 10 cm to 70 cm the discharge of ce1 increases from 0 20 l h 1 to 1 74 l h 1 when h is higher than 3 26 cm h and q conform to the relationship of q 0 027h 0 088 also when the porosity of the emitter increases the emitter discharge increases more importantly the initial working pressure head of each emitter is different the initial working pressure head of ce 1 ranges from 0 01 cm 6 56 cm and 0 19 cm to 8 26 cm for ce2 this indicates that the emitter discharge under low pressure conditions may vary substantially 3 1 2 discharge deviation in the air fig 4 shows the cvm at different h as h increases the discharge deviation in the air of both emitters decreases and the relationship between cvm and h is a logarithmic function for example when h increases from 10 cm to 70 cm the discharge deviation of the ce1 decreases from 38 90 to 20 84 and they fit into a functional relationship of cvm 61 61 9 40ln 1 33 h the ceramic emitter is a porous structure according to eq 6 only when the hydraulic gradient exceeds the initial hydraulic gradient can the emitter seep normally under low pressure conditions the complex pore structure causes the water flow inside the emitter to be chaotic so a small pore deviation may cause a large discharge deviation however when the working pressure head is high the porous medium can flow normally and the discharge deviation will not be particularly large the discharge deviations of these emitters are all higher than the specified value 15 when h is smaller than 70 cm table 1 therefore these emitters cannot be used according to asabe regulations however when h increases the emitter discharge deviation decreases for example when the working pressure head of ce1 is 411 cm the discharge deviation is 5 0 and ce1 can be considered as an excellent product according to asabe regulations when the working pressure head reaches 151 cm the discharge deviation can be 5 0 for ce2 therefore if the emitter discharge deviation smaller than 11 the emitters can be used in the field based on fig 4 the working pressure head must be higher than a specific value 215 cm for ce1 and 110 cm for ce2 3 2 emitter hydraulic characteristics in the soil 3 2 1 emitter discharge in the soil and soil water content fig 5 shows the change of cumulative infiltration with time at different h and emitter types over 360 min as time and h increases the cumulative infiltration increases for example when the irrigation time of ce1 is 360 min the cumulative infiltration under h of 50 cm is 20 58 times than that of 20 cm it is 5 88 times for ce2 under the same conditions as in the air with the same h the cumulative infiltration of ce1 is significantly greater than that of ce2 for example when h is 20 cm the cumulative infiltration of ce1 is 1 90 l and that of ce2 is just 0 20 l however the cumulative infiltration of ce1 under 10 cm is unusual this may be due to the inadequate contact between the emitter and the surrounding soil and then a large positive pressure is generated by the irrigation water surrounding the emitter leading to a smaller cumulative infiltration eq 6 is used to fit the relationship between cumulative infiltration volume i and time t under different emitter types and h the formulas are shown in fig 5 as can be seen from these formulas the index b is in the range of 0 57 0 78 and it shows that the rate of cumulative infiltration would gradually decrease with time the relationship of the emitter discharge infiltration rate in the soil over time can be obtained by taking the derivative of these formulas fig 6 it can be seen from fig 6 that emitter discharge is larger than that in the air at first with increased time the emitter discharge gradually decreases and stabilizes for example when h of ce2 is 10 cm the discharge decreases from 0 41 l h 1 to 0 13 l h 1 h has a strong influence on emitter discharge but the emitter discharge is quite different from that in the air and this is mainly due to the influence of soil water potential from eq 6 the emitter discharge in the soil could be calculated by eq 11 11 q k h w φ c where φ is the soil water potential around the ceramic emitter when h is greater than 0 cm the emitter discharge is determined by h and soil water potential around the ceramic emitter moreover the soil water potential changes from negative to zero or even positive when irrigation water enters the soil when irrigation begins the soil water content is less than the saturated water content the soil water potential is matric potential and it is a negative value therefore the emitter discharge in the soil would be greater than that in the air and soil water potential could promote the outflow of the emitter subsequently the soil water potential increases gradually with increasing soil water content the relationship between soil matric potential and soil water content is expressed by the v g equation van genuchten 1980 12 φ 1 α θ s θ r θ θ r 1 m 1 1 n where θ is soil water content θs is soil saturated water content θr is soil residual water content n and m are fitting parameters m 1 1 n and α is the parameter related to soil physical properties from eqs 11 and 12 we can obtain the emitter discharge as 13 q k h w 1 α θ s θ r θ θ r 1 m 1 1 n c it can be seen from eq 13 that higher the soil water content lower the emitter discharge fig 6 shows the change of the average soil water content in the soil pots at different h and emitter types over 360 min the changes in the soil water content are similar under different treatments and the soil water content increases gradually with time the higher the h the faster the soil water content increases when h of ce1 is 50 cm the soil water content reached the saturated water content in 360 min in general the soil water content of ce1 is higher than that of ce2 however the situation is reversed when h is 10 cm as the soil water content of ce2 is higher than that of ce1 this is because there was a large discharge difference of ce1 when h is 10 cm and the discharges in the soil of the three emitters were almost equal to 0 l h 1 therefore the soil water content of these three replicates is slightly higher than the initial soil water content at 360 min the relationship between the emitter discharge in the soil and air is shown in fig 7 it can be seen the larger h and discharge coefficients the larger the emitter discharge in the soil however emitter discharge in the soil at 360 min of ce1 is less than its discharge in the air conversely it is greater than in the air for ce2 when h is 10 cm some emitters of ce1 and ce2 failed to flow normally which may influence experimental results however when the emitter discharge coefficient is larger such as in ce1 water would quickly enter the soil and the soil water content would reach saturated water content rapidly therefore the matric potential would become 0 and the soil hydraulic conductivity would be the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks if the emitter discharge per unit area q is greater than ks positive pressure will be generated in the soil around the emitter and soil would inhibit the outflow of the emitter therefore the emitter discharge gradually decreases and the discharge in the soil would be a stable value less than the emitter discharge in the air according to shani et al 1996 based on the research of subsurface drip irrigation the positive pressure at the orifice of emitter conformed to the following relationship 14 φ 2 α r 0 8 π k s r 0 q 1 α g where r0 is the radius of the saturated zone and αg is the parameter for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity from gardner s equation gardner 1958 combining eq 11 and 14 the steady emitter discharge is 15 q k h w 1 α g 2 α r 0 8 π k s r 0 k h w s c where s is the external surface area of the emitter according to eqs 14 and 15 it can be seen the soil water content outside the emitter is less than the saturated water content at the beginning of infiltration and the soil water potential is the negative matric potential therefore soil water potential can promote the outflow of the emitter and the emitter discharge is greater than that in the air the soil water potential increases gradually with the increase of water content until reaching saturation when the soil water content reaches saturation the soil water potential outside the emitter becomes 0 so the emitter discharge in the soil is equal to the discharge in the air when irrigation water continues entering the soil ks has been saturated hydraulic conductivity therefore a saturation zone is formed positive pressure generates around the emitter and the emitter discharge would continue to decrease and eventually stabilize when the emitter discharge coefficient is small such as for ce2 q is smaller than the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k θ of soil and soil would be no longer restrain the outflow of the emitter therefore emitter discharge would be a function of soil water potential and the emitter discharge in the soil would be larger than that in the air 3 2 2 discharge deviation in the soil and soil water content uniformity fig 8 shows the variation of the discharge deviation rate in the soil over time under different types of emitters and h it can be seen the higher h of the emitter the smaller the discharge deviation in the soil when h is 10 cm discharge deviations in the soil are greater than 100 for ce1 and ce2 especially the discharge deviation of ce1 that increases gradually with time vasudevan et al 2014 found that there was an additional flow due to the water deficit in the soil this is a negative pressure or an equivalent negative hydraulic head as a result of soil water potential the emitter discharge will produce certain changes compared with that in the air in the soil the emitter discharge is determined by both the working pressure head and soil water potential soil water content as the water content increases the effect of soil will be weakened however the emitter discharge deviations of ce1 and ce2 under 10 cm is different from other treatments this may be due to the inadequate contact between the emitter and the surrounding soil some emitters would not work normally the emitter discharge is nearly 0 l h 1 the emitter discharge deviation is much bigger than others and with time increases the discharge deviation increases fig 9 shows the emitter discharge deviation in the air and soil under different h it can be seen that the emitter discharge deviations decrease with the increase of h and the discharge variations in the air and soil are different when h is less than 20 cm the discharge deviation in the soil decreases rapidly with h when h is higher than 20 cm the discharge deviation would change more smoothly however the discharge deviation in the air will keep decreasing with increasing h when h of the ceramic emitter is higher than 19 cm the discharge deviation in the soil is smaller than that in the air therefore when h is smaller than a threshold value the discharge deviation of the ceramic emitter in the soil would be greater than that in the air this means that when h is higher than the fixed value the soil will play a critical role in balancing the outflow of the emitter such that the discharge deviation is reduced to reduce the discharge deviation the working pressure head of the emitter should be higher than a threshold value about 19 cm according to the regulations of asabe the discharge deviation under h of 10 cm for both types of emitters is not acceptable when h is greater than or equal to 20 cm the discharge deviations in the soil are less than 30 and the discharge deviation in the soil is less than that in the air for example when h is 50 cm the discharge deviation of ce2 is about 3 5 in the soil and the discharge deviation in the air is 22 7 fig 10 shows the change of soil water content uniformity with time under different treatments over 360 min soil water content uniformities are all higher than 80 when h is 20 cm and 50 cm the higher the h the higher the soil water content uniformity however the soil water content uniformity decreases from the initial 100 to less than 80 when h is 10 cm 4 discussion 4 1 the difference between sice and sdi various features of sice and sdi are relevant to compare the discharge of sdi might be affected by the soil water potential however the working pressure head of sdi is generally 1000 cm and the discharge is greater than 0 4 l h 1 due to its large discharge and small orifice of sdi a positive pressure region would form at the orifice in general shani et al 1996 warrick and shani 1996 found that soil water potential became positive in the soils with a lower infiltration capacity compared with the emitter discharge in the air and a small pressure difference across the emitter led to the discharge of the emitter decreasing thebaldi et al 2016 found that positive backpressure reduced emitter discharge and non pressure compensating emitters had a corresponding decrease in the discharge exponent in the pressure compensating emitter the emitter discharge increased if the emitter exponent of the ceramic emitter is 1 and the h is less than 50 cm then positive backpressure builds in the soil and the emitter discharge changes substantially therefore due to backpressure the discharge of non pressure compensating emitters will change significantly saefuddin et al 2019 designed a new ring shaped emitter and the working pressure head was kept constant at 1 cm and 5 cm to avoid a build up in positive backpressure at the outlets of the emitter the ceramic emitter is a non pressure compensating emitter when the emitter discharge coefficient is large such as ce1 the emitter s discharge ratio of soil to air is 71 and 75 under h of 20 cm and 50 cm respectively to avoid the influence of positive pressure on the emitter discharge h should be as small as possible when the emitter discharge coefficient is small such as ce2 with the increase of h the emitter discharge ratio of soil to air decreases from 190 to 109 to make use of the effect of soil water potential on the outflow of the emitter h also should have a smaller value however when h is 10 cm the emitter cannot flow normally therefore to reduce the inhibitory effect of the soil positive pressure and use the soil s promotion effect on the emitter discharge the working pressure head should be a relatively small value but higher than 10 cm 4 2 the difference between sice and pitcher irrigation pitcher irrigation is still widely used in arid and semi arid regions such as in iran india and jordan gopinath and veeravalli 2011 singh et al 2011 tesfaye et al 2011 the irrigation water seeps through micropores inside the pitcher and enters the soil near the roots of the crop therefore this irrigation method has very high water use efficiency batchelor et al 1996 conducted irrigation experiments 1985 1995 and found that subsurface irrigation with clay pipes was a particularly effective method in improving crop yields quality and water use efficiency as well as being inexpensive simple and easy to use abu zreig et al 2018 used seven ceramic pots with various dimensions to evaluate water seepage rates under various environmental and hydraulic conditions the experiments revealed that ceramic pitchers can be used to supply water even under negative pressure head thus eliminating the need for pressurized flow inside irrigation pipes water is the main factor restricting the growth of crops in arid areas and increasing yield and saving water can even be achieved using a pot with a large deviation siyal et al 2016 used clay pots with permeability coefficients 0 114 and 0 060 cm d with the surface area of both pots close to 3000 cm2 abu zreig and atoum 2004 used 14 clay pots that had a permeability coefficient in the range 0 022 0 237 cm d and a surface area 1120 1835 cm2 the relationship between discharge and the permeability coefficient was linear the discharge of clay pots generally low and the water seepage area large as such a small difference in the permeability coefficient may lead to a substantial change in the discharge of the clay pot therefore to ensure the quality of irrigation smaller manufacturing deviations are needed and h of clay pots need to be increased in this study when h of the ceramic emitter is lower than 20 cm the discharge deviation in the soil increased therefore to reduce the discharge deviation and ensure the irrigation quality h of the ceramic emitter must be greater than 20 cm 4 3 irrigation quality index of sice irrigation uniformity is one of the most important indexes in the design and management of irrigation systems patel and rajput 2009 irrigation uniformity is calculated by measuring the emitter discharge and using christiansen s formula it is also possible to measure the pressure distribution on the capillary calculate the discharge through the pressure discharge relationship of the emitter and then calculate uniformity gil et al 2008 however because subsurface irrigation pipes and emitters are buried in the ground discharge and pressure are difficult to measure also the emitter discharge in the soil is generally different from that in the air so evaluation of the uniformity of subsurface irrigation is difficult rodriguez sinobas et al 2009 the irrigation system delivers water to the soil through the emitter and the crop absorbs water from the soil so the soil water content uniformity can better represent irrigation quality it can be seen from fig 10 when h is higher than 20 cm the soil water content uniformity is higher than 80 therefore the irrigation quality is good according to asabe standards however when the discharge deviation in the soil is 6 27 19 16 the performance of the emitter is unacceptable according to asabe standards therefore soil water content uniformity would be a suitable index to evaluate the irrigation quality of sice many factors affect soil water content uniformity such as discharge and manufacturing deviation of the emitter soil spatial variability and spacing of emitters li et al 2012 ren et al 2018 2017 wang et al 2016 rodriguez sinobas et al 2012 found that water application uniformity was good for both drip and subsurface drip irrigation methods zhou et al 2018 found that drip lateral spacing and mulching methods imposed no significant effect on uniformity the higher the h the higher the uniformity when h is less than 20 cm the soil water content uniformity shows a decreasing trend with time and it will be less than 80 after a certain time interval therefore to ensure the uniform growth of crops the working pressure head of sice must be higher than 20 cm 5 conclusions in this paper laboratory experiments were conducted to study ceramic emitter hydraulic characteristics in the air and soil under different working pressure heads and emitter types the study demonstrated that when h increased in the air the emitter discharge increased linearly and the discharge deviation decreased with increased h in the soil the emitter discharge soil water content and soil water content uniformity increased whereas the discharge deviation in the soil decreased gradually when the emitter discharge coefficient was larger the emitter discharge gradually decreased and the discharge in the soil would stabilize and then eventually be less than the emitter discharge when the emitter discharge coefficient was small the emitter discharge in the soil would be larger than in the air when h was greater than or equal to 20 cm the discharge deviation in the soil was less than that in the air and the soil water content uniformity was higher than 80 the soil water content uniformity could be used in the evaluation of the irrigation quality of sice as based on reliability and overall convenience of observation to effectively use soil water potential on the outflow of the emitter reduce the discharge deviation and improve soil water content uniformity the working pressure head of sice should be higher than 20 cm this research should help inform future designs of similar irrigation systems declaration of competing interest the authors

10367,a subsurface irrigation system with ceramic emitters sice without a pump has been developed to limit energy consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions yet whether sice can be used in low pressure conditions has not been tested moreover there is no index for evaluating the irrigation quality of sice laboratory experiments with six treatments were conducted to study ceramic emitter hydraulic characteristics in the air and soil under different working pressure heads and emitter types the results indicated that when h increased the emitter discharge increased linearly and the discharge deviation decreased in the air with increased h in the soil the emitter discharge soil water content and soil water content uniformity increased and the discharge deviation decreased when h was greater than or equal to 20 cm the discharge deviation in the soil was less than that in the air and the soil water content uniformity was higher than 80 the soil water content uniformity could be used in the evaluation of the irrigation quality of sice based on the reliability and convenience of observation to make the best use of soil water potential on the outflow of the emitter reduce the discharge deviation and improve soil water content uniformity the working pressure head of sice should be higher than 20 cm keywords uniformity irrigation quality emitter subsurface irrigation discharge 1 introduction water saving irrigation technology could improve crop yields and reduce labor intensity but it also requires high energy inputs and may cause environmental problems adu et al 2019 sampson and perry 2019 s wang et al 2019 w wang et al 2019 kaltsas et al 2007 reported that irrigation energy demand accounted for approximately 21 of the total energy consumption in conventional olive orchards todde et al 2019 found that the application of photovoltaic irrigation systems would decrease energy consumption 41 and 67 in morocco and portugal and avoid the emission of large amounts of greenhouse gases romero gamez et al 2017 showed that the greatest environmental impact was from an intensively irrigated integrated system and a super intensive irrigated integrated system because of the electricity consumed during irrigation pumps consume most of the electricity in irrigation systems powell et al 2019 to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions an irrigation system that requires a lower working pressure head h and can function without a pump would benefit the industry pitcher or pot irrigation is a traditional irrigation method used to supply water to crops without external inputs such as oil and electricity under drought conditions in arid regions for which h is usually lower than 20 cm paredes and san jose 2019 siyal et al 2009 singh and ghosal 2015 argued that the interaction of pitcher fertigation brought a 106 9 and 13 5 increase in lac crop yield ratio of ber ziziphus mauritiana in summer and winter respectively pachpute 2010 used a suite of water management practices including a pitcher irrigation method as well as water conservation techniques of manure application and mulching in north eastern tanzania that led to an increase 203 in total cucumber yield batchelor et al 1996 found that subsurface irrigation with clay pipes was particularly effective in improving yields crop quality and water use efficiency as well as being inexpensive simple and easy to use in southeast zimbabwe and northern sri lanka however irrigation of crops with pitchers or ceramic tubes is seldom scaled up in modern field conditions bainbridge 2001 one problem is that pitchers are difficult to connect to large scale irrigation systems pachpute 2010 the other is that discharges and manufacturing deviations of devices are difficult to precisely control hajjaji and mezouari 2011 naik et al 2013 therefore to meet modern irrigation requirements optimized pitcher structures and material properties are needed a subsurface irrigation system with ceramic emitters sice recently has been developed cai et al 2017 most of the components of sice are similar to a subsurface drip irrigation system sdi camp 1998 lamm and trooien 2003 it eliminates the need for pumps as irrigation water is supplied by a water tank of constant pressure such a sice works with low pressure small discharge and continuously which would maintain a suitable root zone and soil water content thus maintaining water availability to plants lazarovitch et al 2006 the h of a ceramic emitter is usually smaller than 100 cm and it can be close to zero or negative ashrafi et al 2002 li et al 2019 found that negative pressure water supply not only maintained a high fruit yield but also significantly increased water use efficiency nalliah and ranjan 2010 stated that a capillary irrigation technique with porous membranes with different negative pressures offered precise water delivery with minimal labor requirements suitable for use in greenhouse pepper production however in field environments the conditions in which an h of zero or negative seldom occur unless there is a special water supply to provide water for the emitter li et al 2017 cai et al 2018 suggested that the h of ceramic emitter should be higher than 20 cm under field conditions to reduce system costs yet this conclusion was just assumed based on previous observations therefore a critical question remains can a sice be used with h lower than 20 cm in a sice ceramic emitters are used in place of traditional plastic emitters there are many advantages of ceramic emitters over pitchers such as controllable emitter discharge and environmental safety cai et al 2017 however large manufacturing deviations are a prominent feature of ceramic products to reduce manufacturing deviations of ceramics researchers have adopted various methods such as droplet jetting slurry curing procedures cai et al 2019a and frozen slurry based laminated object manufacturing processes zhang et al 2018 however in most developing countries it is difficult to prepare ceramic emitters pitchers pots with low manufacturing deviation because ceramic emitters are typically made by hand siyal et al 2009 vasudevan et al 2011 much of the research on the performance of sdi systems in the last two decades has focused on how the interaction between the effects of emitter discharge and soil properties could affect irrigation uniformity lazarovitch et al 2006 gil et al 2008 found that irrigation uniformity of sdi non compensating emitters to be greater than surface drip irrigation due to the interaction between the effects of emitter discharge and soil pressure ren et al 2017 stated that the greater the initial water content soil bulk density and mass fractal dimension the smaller the deviation rate of lateral flow of an sdi the emitter discharge exponent of the ceramic emitter in the sice system is 1 and thus it is a non compensating emitter asabe 2006 cai et al 2019b however the h and discharge of sice are lower than for sdi as such can soil properties affect irrigation uniformity of sice especially for ceramic emitters with large manufacturing deviations the present study aimed to 1 compare emitter discharge and discharge deviations in the air and soils under different h and emitter types 2 select a suitable indicator for evaluating irrigation quality of sice and 3 identify a working pressure head for sice 2 materials and methods 2 1 emitter hydraulic characteristics in the air 2 1 1 experimental setup the experiment setup had eight major components water tank pump manometer branch lateral ceramic emitters beakers and manometer fig 1 five ceramic emitters were installed on one lateral and the emitter spacing was 0 20 m five laterals were connected by a branch total emitter n 25 and the branch was fed by the water tank and pump the emitter discharge under different h was observed and recorded emitter discharge was measured by the weighing method and taken as the average of 25 replicates the irrigation water used in the experiment was urban domestic water from yangling and the water temperature during the test was 20 3 c in the experiment ceramic emitters with two different porosities were employed which were denoted as ce1 and ce2 the ceramic emitters were made of silica talc and silica sol and then sintered in a tunnel furnace the porosity of the ceramic emitters was controlled by altering the grain size of the silica the external diameter internal diameter inner hole depth and height of ceramic emitters were 39 37 mm 19 82 mm 4 97 mm and 6 80 mm respectively the open porosity of ce1 and ce2 were 0 36 and 0 28 respectively 2 1 2 calculated method flow velocity of the fluid through the porous materials can be calculated by obtaining the relation between the pressure drop and hydraulic conductivity of the porous materials wu et al 2018 as the ceramic emitters are made of porous ceramics and we assume that the ceramic emitter is always saturated during irrigation therefore laminar flow occurs in the pore and darcy s law which describes a linear relationship between pressure gradient and the fluid velocity is reliable li et al 2019a 2019b 1 v q a k d h d l where d h d l is the pressure gradient along the fluid direction v is the fluid velocity calculated by the emitter discharge divided by seepage area k is the emitter hydraulic conductivity q is emitter discharge a is emitter seepage area for the fluid that cannot be compressed the pressure gradient can be calculated as 2 d h d l h in h out l where h in is the pressure of water at the ceramic emitter entrance and in most cases h in is equal to the working pressure h w h out is the pressure of water at the ceramic emitter exit when the ceramic emitter is working in air h out 0 l is the seepage tracking therefore the emitter discharge in air could be expressed as 3 q k a h w l however for some types of porous media with small pore size such as fine grained soil sandstones fluids can flow through these porous media only if the fluid force is sufficient to overcome the threshold pressure gradient wang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 min et al 2018 liu and birkholzer 2012 prada and civan 1999 studied the permeability of saturated brine in eight typical sandstones and brown sandstones and found the permeation of saturated brine was not consistent with darcy s law there was an initial pressure gradient which is the function of the permeability of pore medium and the viscosity coefficient of the fluid therefore eq 3 would be 4 q k a h w h i l where h i l is initial pressure gradient for ceramic emitter the emitter discharge would not be negative value and for a certain porous medium the initial pressure h i is constant value therefore eq 4 would be 5 q 0 h w h i q k h w h i a l k h w a l i k h w a l c h w h i where i and c are constant values for a ceramic emitter for which structure parameters and ceramic characteristics are fixed values the emitter seepage area a seepage tracking l and hydraulic conductivity k are constants and therefore eq 5 can be re written as 6 q 0 h w h i q k h w c h w h i where k is the emitter discharge coefficient due to various factors such as manufacturing specific processes and material deformation the emitter will inevitably produce deviations in the present experiments the lateral length was just 2 m the discharge deviation caused by hydraulic deviation was negligible so the emitter discharge variation in the air would be equal to the emitter manufacturing variation the calculation of manufacturing variation cvm is given in eq 7 7 c v m 1 n 1 q x q 2 q 2 where qx is the xth emitter discharge in the air q is average emitter discharge under the same h and n is the total number of emitters 25 the evaluation standards of cvm listed by the american society of agricultural and biological engineers are shown in table 1 2 2 emitter hydraulic characteristics in the soil 2 2 1 experimental setup the experiment setup had eight major components constant pressure water tank pressure sensors laterals intake microtubules drainage microtubules ceramic emitters soil pots and balance fig 2 the laboratory experiments were performed in five soil pots volume 17 24 l made of plastic with the pot spacing 35 cm ceramic emitters were fed by the constant pressure water tank in each pot only one ceramic emitter was installed at a depth of 15 cm and it was connected to the lateral with a 4 mm rubber intake microtubule at the beginning of the experiment a rubber drainage microtubule was connected to the headcover of the ceramic emitter to exhaust air in the lateral and microtubule 2 2 2 soil sample after sieving using a 2 mm mesh sieve the air dried soil with an average soil bulk density of 1 3 g cm 3 was used to fill the soil tank clay loam 33 1 clay 26 8 silt and 40 1 sand usda soil taxonomy was selected for the study the procedure for filling the pots was first to feed the ceramic emitter and rubber pipe through the right side and the loading and compaction 5 cm layers of soil to each pot to avoid soil stratification the upper surface of each layer was ensured to be sufficiently rough the cumulative infiltration of the emitter was obtained by weighing the soil pot at intervals of 10 min for the first 1 h and then at intervals of 30 min for the last 5 h the cumulative infiltration of the ceramic emitter may be affected by various parameters but experiments were implemented specifically to study the effect of h and emitter type on emitter infiltration characteristics of the soil the input data of experiments are listed in table 2 2 2 3 calculated method the relationship between cumulative infiltration and time can be described by a power function su et al 2016 8 i a t b c where i is the cumulative infiltration at time t and a b and c are the coefficients therefore the emitter discharge in the soil or infiltration rate could be obtained by eq 7 9 q i d i d t a b t b 1 system uniformity is ordinarily defined in terms of the variation of q from emitter to emitter and the coefficient of variation cvq of emitters buried in the soil can also be calculated by eq 5 when ceramic emitters are buried in the soil emitter discharge is not easily measured and thus system uniformity is difficult to calculate therefore soil water content uniformity may be much easier to observe than that of emitter discharge christiansen soil water content uniformity cuθ may be expressed by christiansen 1941 10 c u θ 1 1 n x 1 n θ x θ θ where θx is the xth soil water content in the soil pot and θ is the average soil water content of a total of 5 pots the evaluation standards of cuθ listed by the american society of agricultural and biological engineers are shown in table 3 3 results 3 1 emitter hydraulic characteristics in the air 3 1 1 emitter discharge in the air fig 3 shows the emitter discharge at different h in the air a linear relationship is observed between the emitter discharge and h for example as h increases from 10 cm to 70 cm the discharge of ce1 increases from 0 20 l h 1 to 1 74 l h 1 when h is higher than 3 26 cm h and q conform to the relationship of q 0 027h 0 088 also when the porosity of the emitter increases the emitter discharge increases more importantly the initial working pressure head of each emitter is different the initial working pressure head of ce 1 ranges from 0 01 cm 6 56 cm and 0 19 cm to 8 26 cm for ce2 this indicates that the emitter discharge under low pressure conditions may vary substantially 3 1 2 discharge deviation in the air fig 4 shows the cvm at different h as h increases the discharge deviation in the air of both emitters decreases and the relationship between cvm and h is a logarithmic function for example when h increases from 10 cm to 70 cm the discharge deviation of the ce1 decreases from 38 90 to 20 84 and they fit into a functional relationship of cvm 61 61 9 40ln 1 33 h the ceramic emitter is a porous structure according to eq 6 only when the hydraulic gradient exceeds the initial hydraulic gradient can the emitter seep normally under low pressure conditions the complex pore structure causes the water flow inside the emitter to be chaotic so a small pore deviation may cause a large discharge deviation however when the working pressure head is high the porous medium can flow normally and the discharge deviation will not be particularly large the discharge deviations of these emitters are all higher than the specified value 15 when h is smaller than 70 cm table 1 therefore these emitters cannot be used according to asabe regulations however when h increases the emitter discharge deviation decreases for example when the working pressure head of ce1 is 411 cm the discharge deviation is 5 0 and ce1 can be considered as an excellent product according to asabe regulations when the working pressure head reaches 151 cm the discharge deviation can be 5 0 for ce2 therefore if the emitter discharge deviation smaller than 11 the emitters can be used in the field based on fig 4 the working pressure head must be higher than a specific value 215 cm for ce1 and 110 cm for ce2 3 2 emitter hydraulic characteristics in the soil 3 2 1 emitter discharge in the soil and soil water content fig 5 shows the change of cumulative infiltration with time at different h and emitter types over 360 min as time and h increases the cumulative infiltration increases for example when the irrigation time of ce1 is 360 min the cumulative infiltration under h of 50 cm is 20 58 times than that of 20 cm it is 5 88 times for ce2 under the same conditions as in the air with the same h the cumulative infiltration of ce1 is significantly greater than that of ce2 for example when h is 20 cm the cumulative infiltration of ce1 is 1 90 l and that of ce2 is just 0 20 l however the cumulative infiltration of ce1 under 10 cm is unusual this may be due to the inadequate contact between the emitter and the surrounding soil and then a large positive pressure is generated by the irrigation water surrounding the emitter leading to a smaller cumulative infiltration eq 6 is used to fit the relationship between cumulative infiltration volume i and time t under different emitter types and h the formulas are shown in fig 5 as can be seen from these formulas the index b is in the range of 0 57 0 78 and it shows that the rate of cumulative infiltration would gradually decrease with time the relationship of the emitter discharge infiltration rate in the soil over time can be obtained by taking the derivative of these formulas fig 6 it can be seen from fig 6 that emitter discharge is larger than that in the air at first with increased time the emitter discharge gradually decreases and stabilizes for example when h of ce2 is 10 cm the discharge decreases from 0 41 l h 1 to 0 13 l h 1 h has a strong influence on emitter discharge but the emitter discharge is quite different from that in the air and this is mainly due to the influence of soil water potential from eq 6 the emitter discharge in the soil could be calculated by eq 11 11 q k h w φ c where φ is the soil water potential around the ceramic emitter when h is greater than 0 cm the emitter discharge is determined by h and soil water potential around the ceramic emitter moreover the soil water potential changes from negative to zero or even positive when irrigation water enters the soil when irrigation begins the soil water content is less than the saturated water content the soil water potential is matric potential and it is a negative value therefore the emitter discharge in the soil would be greater than that in the air and soil water potential could promote the outflow of the emitter subsequently the soil water potential increases gradually with increasing soil water content the relationship between soil matric potential and soil water content is expressed by the v g equation van genuchten 1980 12 φ 1 α θ s θ r θ θ r 1 m 1 1 n where θ is soil water content θs is soil saturated water content θr is soil residual water content n and m are fitting parameters m 1 1 n and α is the parameter related to soil physical properties from eqs 11 and 12 we can obtain the emitter discharge as 13 q k h w 1 α θ s θ r θ θ r 1 m 1 1 n c it can be seen from eq 13 that higher the soil water content lower the emitter discharge fig 6 shows the change of the average soil water content in the soil pots at different h and emitter types over 360 min the changes in the soil water content are similar under different treatments and the soil water content increases gradually with time the higher the h the faster the soil water content increases when h of ce1 is 50 cm the soil water content reached the saturated water content in 360 min in general the soil water content of ce1 is higher than that of ce2 however the situation is reversed when h is 10 cm as the soil water content of ce2 is higher than that of ce1 this is because there was a large discharge difference of ce1 when h is 10 cm and the discharges in the soil of the three emitters were almost equal to 0 l h 1 therefore the soil water content of these three replicates is slightly higher than the initial soil water content at 360 min the relationship between the emitter discharge in the soil and air is shown in fig 7 it can be seen the larger h and discharge coefficients the larger the emitter discharge in the soil however emitter discharge in the soil at 360 min of ce1 is less than its discharge in the air conversely it is greater than in the air for ce2 when h is 10 cm some emitters of ce1 and ce2 failed to flow normally which may influence experimental results however when the emitter discharge coefficient is larger such as in ce1 water would quickly enter the soil and the soil water content would reach saturated water content rapidly therefore the matric potential would become 0 and the soil hydraulic conductivity would be the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks if the emitter discharge per unit area q is greater than ks positive pressure will be generated in the soil around the emitter and soil would inhibit the outflow of the emitter therefore the emitter discharge gradually decreases and the discharge in the soil would be a stable value less than the emitter discharge in the air according to shani et al 1996 based on the research of subsurface drip irrigation the positive pressure at the orifice of emitter conformed to the following relationship 14 φ 2 α r 0 8 π k s r 0 q 1 α g where r0 is the radius of the saturated zone and αg is the parameter for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity from gardner s equation gardner 1958 combining eq 11 and 14 the steady emitter discharge is 15 q k h w 1 α g 2 α r 0 8 π k s r 0 k h w s c where s is the external surface area of the emitter according to eqs 14 and 15 it can be seen the soil water content outside the emitter is less than the saturated water content at the beginning of infiltration and the soil water potential is the negative matric potential therefore soil water potential can promote the outflow of the emitter and the emitter discharge is greater than that in the air the soil water potential increases gradually with the increase of water content until reaching saturation when the soil water content reaches saturation the soil water potential outside the emitter becomes 0 so the emitter discharge in the soil is equal to the discharge in the air when irrigation water continues entering the soil ks has been saturated hydraulic conductivity therefore a saturation zone is formed positive pressure generates around the emitter and the emitter discharge would continue to decrease and eventually stabilize when the emitter discharge coefficient is small such as for ce2 q is smaller than the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k θ of soil and soil would be no longer restrain the outflow of the emitter therefore emitter discharge would be a function of soil water potential and the emitter discharge in the soil would be larger than that in the air 3 2 2 discharge deviation in the soil and soil water content uniformity fig 8 shows the variation of the discharge deviation rate in the soil over time under different types of emitters and h it can be seen the higher h of the emitter the smaller the discharge deviation in the soil when h is 10 cm discharge deviations in the soil are greater than 100 for ce1 and ce2 especially the discharge deviation of ce1 that increases gradually with time vasudevan et al 2014 found that there was an additional flow due to the water deficit in the soil this is a negative pressure or an equivalent negative hydraulic head as a result of soil water potential the emitter discharge will produce certain changes compared with that in the air in the soil the emitter discharge is determined by both the working pressure head and soil water potential soil water content as the water content increases the effect of soil will be weakened however the emitter discharge deviations of ce1 and ce2 under 10 cm is different from other treatments this may be due to the inadequate contact between the emitter and the surrounding soil some emitters would not work normally the emitter discharge is nearly 0 l h 1 the emitter discharge deviation is much bigger than others and with time increases the discharge deviation increases fig 9 shows the emitter discharge deviation in the air and soil under different h it can be seen that the emitter discharge deviations decrease with the increase of h and the discharge variations in the air and soil are different when h is less than 20 cm the discharge deviation in the soil decreases rapidly with h when h is higher than 20 cm the discharge deviation would change more smoothly however the discharge deviation in the air will keep decreasing with increasing h when h of the ceramic emitter is higher than 19 cm the discharge deviation in the soil is smaller than that in the air therefore when h is smaller than a threshold value the discharge deviation of the ceramic emitter in the soil would be greater than that in the air this means that when h is higher than the fixed value the soil will play a critical role in balancing the outflow of the emitter such that the discharge deviation is reduced to reduce the discharge deviation the working pressure head of the emitter should be higher than a threshold value about 19 cm according to the regulations of asabe the discharge deviation under h of 10 cm for both types of emitters is not acceptable when h is greater than or equal to 20 cm the discharge deviations in the soil are less than 30 and the discharge deviation in the soil is less than that in the air for example when h is 50 cm the discharge deviation of ce2 is about 3 5 in the soil and the discharge deviation in the air is 22 7 fig 10 shows the change of soil water content uniformity with time under different treatments over 360 min soil water content uniformities are all higher than 80 when h is 20 cm and 50 cm the higher the h the higher the soil water content uniformity however the soil water content uniformity decreases from the initial 100 to less than 80 when h is 10 cm 4 discussion 4 1 the difference between sice and sdi various features of sice and sdi are relevant to compare the discharge of sdi might be affected by the soil water potential however the working pressure head of sdi is generally 1000 cm and the discharge is greater than 0 4 l h 1 due to its large discharge and small orifice of sdi a positive pressure region would form at the orifice in general shani et al 1996 warrick and shani 1996 found that soil water potential became positive in the soils with a lower infiltration capacity compared with the emitter discharge in the air and a small pressure difference across the emitter led to the discharge of the emitter decreasing thebaldi et al 2016 found that positive backpressure reduced emitter discharge and non pressure compensating emitters had a corresponding decrease in the discharge exponent in the pressure compensating emitter the emitter discharge increased if the emitter exponent of the ceramic emitter is 1 and the h is less than 50 cm then positive backpressure builds in the soil and the emitter discharge changes substantially therefore due to backpressure the discharge of non pressure compensating emitters will change significantly saefuddin et al 2019 designed a new ring shaped emitter and the working pressure head was kept constant at 1 cm and 5 cm to avoid a build up in positive backpressure at the outlets of the emitter the ceramic emitter is a non pressure compensating emitter when the emitter discharge coefficient is large such as ce1 the emitter s discharge ratio of soil to air is 71 and 75 under h of 20 cm and 50 cm respectively to avoid the influence of positive pressure on the emitter discharge h should be as small as possible when the emitter discharge coefficient is small such as ce2 with the increase of h the emitter discharge ratio of soil to air decreases from 190 to 109 to make use of the effect of soil water potential on the outflow of the emitter h also should have a smaller value however when h is 10 cm the emitter cannot flow normally therefore to reduce the inhibitory effect of the soil positive pressure and use the soil s promotion effect on the emitter discharge the working pressure head should be a relatively small value but higher than 10 cm 4 2 the difference between sice and pitcher irrigation pitcher irrigation is still widely used in arid and semi arid regions such as in iran india and jordan gopinath and veeravalli 2011 singh et al 2011 tesfaye et al 2011 the irrigation water seeps through micropores inside the pitcher and enters the soil near the roots of the crop therefore this irrigation method has very high water use efficiency batchelor et al 1996 conducted irrigation experiments 1985 1995 and found that subsurface irrigation with clay pipes was a particularly effective method in improving crop yields quality and water use efficiency as well as being inexpensive simple and easy to use abu zreig et al 2018 used seven ceramic pots with various dimensions to evaluate water seepage rates under various environmental and hydraulic conditions the experiments revealed that ceramic pitchers can be used to supply water even under negative pressure head thus eliminating the need for pressurized flow inside irrigation pipes water is the main factor restricting the growth of crops in arid areas and increasing yield and saving water can even be achieved using a pot with a large deviation siyal et al 2016 used clay pots with permeability coefficients 0 114 and 0 060 cm d with the surface area of both pots close to 3000 cm2 abu zreig and atoum 2004 used 14 clay pots that had a permeability coefficient in the range 0 022 0 237 cm d and a surface area 1120 1835 cm2 the relationship between discharge and the permeability coefficient was linear the discharge of clay pots generally low and the water seepage area large as such a small difference in the permeability coefficient may lead to a substantial change in the discharge of the clay pot therefore to ensure the quality of irrigation smaller manufacturing deviations are needed and h of clay pots need to be increased in this study when h of the ceramic emitter is lower than 20 cm the discharge deviation in the soil increased therefore to reduce the discharge deviation and ensure the irrigation quality h of the ceramic emitter must be greater than 20 cm 4 3 irrigation quality index of sice irrigation uniformity is one of the most important indexes in the design and management of irrigation systems patel and rajput 2009 irrigation uniformity is calculated by measuring the emitter discharge and using christiansen s formula it is also possible to measure the pressure distribution on the capillary calculate the discharge through the pressure discharge relationship of the emitter and then calculate uniformity gil et al 2008 however because subsurface irrigation pipes and emitters are buried in the ground discharge and pressure are difficult to measure also the emitter discharge in the soil is generally different from that in the air so evaluation of the uniformity of subsurface irrigation is difficult rodriguez sinobas et al 2009 the irrigation system delivers water to the soil through the emitter and the crop absorbs water from the soil so the soil water content uniformity can better represent irrigation quality it can be seen from fig 10 when h is higher than 20 cm the soil water content uniformity is higher than 80 therefore the irrigation quality is good according to asabe standards however when the discharge deviation in the soil is 6 27 19 16 the performance of the emitter is unacceptable according to asabe standards therefore soil water content uniformity would be a suitable index to evaluate the irrigation quality of sice many factors affect soil water content uniformity such as discharge and manufacturing deviation of the emitter soil spatial variability and spacing of emitters li et al 2012 ren et al 2018 2017 wang et al 2016 rodriguez sinobas et al 2012 found that water application uniformity was good for both drip and subsurface drip irrigation methods zhou et al 2018 found that drip lateral spacing and mulching methods imposed no significant effect on uniformity the higher the h the higher the uniformity when h is less than 20 cm the soil water content uniformity shows a decreasing trend with time and it will be less than 80 after a certain time interval therefore to ensure the uniform growth of crops the working pressure head of sice must be higher than 20 cm 5 conclusions in this paper laboratory experiments were conducted to study ceramic emitter hydraulic characteristics in the air and soil under different working pressure heads and emitter types the study demonstrated that when h increased in the air the emitter discharge increased linearly and the discharge deviation decreased with increased h in the soil the emitter discharge soil water content and soil water content uniformity increased whereas the discharge deviation in the soil decreased gradually when the emitter discharge coefficient was larger the emitter discharge gradually decreased and the discharge in the soil would stabilize and then eventually be less than the emitter discharge when the emitter discharge coefficient was small the emitter discharge in the soil would be larger than in the air when h was greater than or equal to 20 cm the discharge deviation in the soil was less than that in the air and the soil water content uniformity was higher than 80 the soil water content uniformity could be used in the evaluation of the irrigation quality of sice as based on reliability and overall convenience of observation to effectively use soil water potential on the outflow of the emitter reduce the discharge deviation and improve soil water content uniformity the working pressure head of sice should be higher than 20 cm this research should help inform future designs of similar irrigation systems declaration of competing interest the authors

10368,in semi arid production regions having a high inter annual rainfall variability farmers use low plant densities that promote tillering in maize zea mays l tillering in maize is a scarcely researched trait even though it offers vegetative and reproductive plasticity however the production of tillered maize crops may be risky due to a possible early soil water depletion and or low reproductive efficiency here we explored the potential effects of tillers 0 1 and 2 tillers pl 1 on the water economy plant growth and kernel set of maize crops at a low plant density 2 pl m 2 through the combination of simulations using an adapted version of apsim sorghum model and field experiments the simulated scenarios included six locations across argentina and australia and three levels of

number per plant knp i e reproductive plasticity sangoi et al 2011 however in dry environments where farmers use defensive strategies i e low plant populations tillers may be seen as an undesirable vegetative structure for example plant spatial arrangements that promoted tillering in maize showed lower values of water use efficiency for total biomass or grain yield kapanigowda et al 2010 allen 2012 possibly tillers cause higher soil water consumption during early stages of the crop cycle due to an increased crop transpiration thus reducing soil water availability towards the critical period for kernel set i e approximately 30 days bracketing female flowering kiniry and ritchie 1985 cerrudo et al 2013 although experimental data provide important evidence experiments carried out during a reduced number of growing seasons can be misleading especially when facing high seasonal climate variability functional simulation models such as apsim www apsim info holzworth et al 2014 which use soil data and historical climate records capturing the inter annual variability of rainfalls can aid in the characterization of crop water economy variables such as cumulative transpiration and evapotranspiration during the pre flowering period or available soil water content at flowering however at present there is no maize model capable of simulating tillers apsim sorghum hammer et al 2010 does contain a tillering routine and it also estimates the dynamics of the crop water supply crop demand providing a measure of the intensity and timing of water limitation in relation to crop development i e the environment type hammer et al 2014 apsim sorghum can be re programmed parameterized and validated with cautions to simulate a tillering maize then it would be possible to explore in a dynamic manner the effect of tillers on crop water economy in target environments another advantage of using the apsim simulation framework is its functional capacity to simulate kernel number

tollenaar et al 1992 andrade et al 1999 2002 vega et al 2001 echarte et al 2004 ciancio et al 2016 but none for tillering genotypes an individual plant approach to determine this function for a tillering genotype combined with a crop simulation exercise using apsim could provide clues regarding the effect of tillers on crop water economy plant growth and kernel set in low density maize crops understanding these processes is crucial to guide breeding programs and crop management in production environments where low plant population densities are likely to promote tillering the objectives of this work were i using apsim to predict the effect of tillers on vegetative plasticity water economy and pgrf in low density maize crops for three locations across the southwestern pampas of argentina and three locations across the main dryland maize production region of australia in queensland and new south wales setting three contrasting levels of available soil water content at sowing ii through field experiments to parameterize the relationship between knp and pgrf for a tillering maize genotype including tillered and non tillered plants and iii to explore the effect of seasonal climate variability on kernel number m 2 for tillered and non tillered crops in the different environmental conditions explored based on the simulated pgrf values and the function described in ii 2

tiller emission tetio kagho and gardner 1988 was used in all simulations treatments were the factorial combination of three tillering patterns 0 1 and 2 tillers pl 1 and three levels of available soil water content at sowing 50 70 and 90 of total soil water holding capacity these soil water content values were chosen after running simulations using a climatic series of 32 years in each location 1983 2014 starting with an initial soil water content of 15 filled from the top soil horizon to the bottom soil horizon on january 1 in australia and on april 1 in argentina typical harvesting dates of the previous wheat and soybean crops respectively due to the high interannual variability of autumn winter and early spring rainfalls in each location there was a different probability of having 50 70 or 90 of available soil water content at sowing each simulation ended on the physiological maturity date of the maize crop and for each run the soil water n and residue pools were reset at sowing for every combination of location 6 tillering situation 3 and available soil water content 3 at sowing a 32 year simulation was run 2 1 3 simulation outputs the method described in hammer et al 2014 was used to identify five different environment types from a cluster analysis of water limitation time series during the 400 c d window around flowering environment type 1 very low water limitation envt1 environment type 2 low terminal water limitation starting after kernel set envt2 environment type 3 severe water limitation around flowering with a recovery after kernel set envt3 environment type 4 severe terminal water limitation starting before flowering envt4 environment type 5 severe water limitation starting after kernel set envt5 in this paper one of the outputs of the simulations was the environment type for each tillering situation in every location with 50 70 and 90 of available soil water content at sowing n 32 years x 3 available soil water content at sowing levels 96 the frequency of each environment type at each location number of years of each environment type 96 simulations for non tillered crops and the effect of tillers on the frequency of these water limitation patterns were calculated other simulation outputs of crop water economy variables for every combination of tillering situation available soil water content at sowing and location were the cumulative frequency of i aswf characterizing remaining soil water supply during the most critical stage of the crop cycle for yield determination ii crop actual total evapotranspiration until flowering etapf characterizing crop water consumption during the pre flowering period and iii the ratio between crop transpiration and crop actual evapotranspiration until flowering trpf etapf characterizing the partition between transpiration a productive component and evaporation an unproductive component of crop water consumption also for every combination of tillering situation available soil water content at sowing and location we simulated the cumulative frequency of iv laif characterizing vegetative plasticity and v pgrf differences across locations and within locations across values of available soil water content at sowing were compared either using the median p50 the lower p10 or higher p90 percentiles of the cumulative frequency distributions of the different simulated variables as well as the coefficient of variation cv as a measurement of interannual variability within treatments 2 2 field experiments field experiments were established to i confirm that apsim tillering routine adequately resembles the evolution of biomass to flowering of maize crops with different tiller number and ii to parameterize the relationship between knp and pgrf for non tillered maize plants andrade et al 1999 2002 vega et al 2001 echarte et al 2004 ciancio et al 2016 and tillered maize plants never documented before contrasting plant densities and levels of n availability were used to obtain a wide range of pgrf in both tillered plants and non tillered plants encompassing the pgrf values obtained from apsim simulations see section 2 3 2 2 1 crop management a tillering prone semi dent commercial maize hybrid ax7784 vt3p from nidera semillas sa tolerant to glyphosate n phosphonomethyl glycine and widely used by farmers in argentina was cultivated during two growing seasons 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 at the experimental field of the department of plant production university of buenos aires argentina 34 35 s 58 29 w on a deep silty clay loam soil vertic argiudoll soil science division staff 2017 the hybrid was cultivated at two plant densities 2 and 4 pl m 2 with rows 0 5 m apart from each other an additional plot cultivated at 2 pl m 2 was included in each block where tillers were removed immediately after their emergence the 2 pl m 2 plots involved eight rows and the 4 pl m 2 plots involved six rows with all plots being 10 m long the design was a split plot randomized complete block design with three replicates with n treatment in the main plot and the combination of tiller removal and plant density in the sub plot the experiments were manually sown on november 17 2017 and november 6 2018 to ensure the stand of plants three seeds per hill were sown and later thinned by hand to one plant per site at the one ligulated leaf stage v1 ritchie et al 1993 in both years native soil nitrogen at sowing 0 0 6 m depth was 60 kg n ha 1 after sowing half of the plots were fertilized with urea 46 0 0 to reach 220 kg n ha 1 giving two contrasting initial soil nitrogen availabilities weeds were chemically controlled using atrazine 2 5 kg ha 1 acetochlor 3 5 l ha 1 and halosulfuron methyl 120 g ha 1 before crop emergence and glyphosate 2 5 l ha 1 after crop emergence insect injury was managed chemically using flubendiamide 80 ml ha 1 no disease incidence was registered in any of the two experiments but intense rainfall events occurred during the initial vegetative stages of the second experimental season caused growth restriction during several days due to flooding except for the mentioned flooding event in the second experimental season soil moisture remained close to field capacity throughout the crop cycle by drip irrigation in both experiments 2 2 2 measurements twelve consecutive plants of equal size and similar ontogenic stage were tagged at v3 in six central rows of the 2 pl m 2 plots with and without tiller removal or in four central rows of the 4 pl m 2 plots for each plant the number of ligulated leaves vn stages was recorded weekly in both the main shoot and tillers when they were present daily observations of silk exertion from the apical ear of both the main shoot and tillers of each tagged plant were performed and the silking date of each ear was recorded when at least one silk per ear was visible non destructive allometric models were used to estimate vegetative biomass of each tagged plant at i ca 15 days before silking of the apical ear of the main shoot ii silking of the apical ear of the main shoot iii silking of the apical ear of tillers iv 15 days after silking date of the apical ear of the main shoot and v 15 days after silking of the apical ear of tillers on each main shoot or tiller measurements involved maximum and minimum stem base diameter and height from the ground level to the insertion of the last expanded leaf allometric models were also used to estimate biomass of the apical and sub apical ear of the main shoot and tiller of each tagged plant at silking date of apical ear and 15 days after that date using measurements of the maximum diameter of the ears measurements of stem or ear diameter were taken with an electronic digital vernier caliper while the measurements of shoot height were taken with a tape measure total plant biomass at silking date of the apical ear and 15 days after that date was computed as the sum of estimated vegetative biomass in the main shoot and tillers and those of the apical and the sub apical ears this non destructive technique has been widely used in maize to estimate pgrf of tagged plants remaining in the field until harvest in both non prolific and prolific maize genotypes andrade et al 1999 vega et al 2001 echarte et al 2004 rossini et al 2011 laserna et al 2012 ciancio et al 2016 this methodology was never used before to estimate biomass of maize plants with tillers during both experiments plants of each hybrid were sampled ca 70 plants per ontogenic stage 855 total main shoots 558 main shoot ears 710 tillers and 323 tiller ears throughout several ontogenic stages including the ones described for the tagged plants table 1 non destructive allometric measurements described above were performed on the main shoot tillers and ears when they were present of these sampled plants immediately after measurements plants were separated in main shoot and tillers and the vegetative stalk leaves tassel and reproductive husks cob florets biomass of each shoot category main shoot and tillers was identified biomass was oven dried at 65 c until constant weight allometric relationships were established between morphometric variables and dry weights of main shoots tillers and ears vegetative biomass stalk leaves tassel of main shoots or tillers was estimated based on a quadratic function eq 1 fitted to shoot dry weight and stem volume table 1 and fig s2 considering the equation of cylinder volume vol cm3 1 vegetative biomass g a b vol cm 3 c vol cm 3 2 where a is the y intercept fixed at zero to be biologically meaningful b is the parameter of the linear term and c is the parameter of the quadratic term biomass of the apical and sub apical ear husks cob florets at silking date of apical ear and 15 days after that date was estimated with an exponential function eq 2 fitted to ear dry weight and maximum ear diameter mm of sampled ears of main shoot and tillers table 1 and fig s2 2 apical or sub apical ear biomass g d e x m m where d and e are the parameters of the exponential term and x is the ear diameter mm at physiological maturity tagged plants were individually harvested and kernel number of each ear was counted manually knp was calculated as the sum of kernels of every ear of main shoot and tillers in each plant kernel like structures in the tassels of the tillers moulia et al 1999 were not considered as they are non marketable due to the exposition to pests and weather conditions because of the lack of husks 2 2 3 functional relationships between knp and pgrf of tillered and on tillered plants in both experiments there was some delay ca 7 days between silking in the apical ears of main shoot and silking of apical ears of tillers pgrf for non tillered plants those of plots at 2 pl m 2 where tillers were removed or those ones naturally without tillers at 2 4 pl m 2 was estimated from the slope of the linear regression fitted to estimated plant biomass vegetative reproductive biomass at three stages 227 cd ca 15 days before silking date of the apical ear silking date of the apical ear and 15 days after silking date of the apical ear and time in days from sowing pgrf of tillered plant mostly those plants of plots at 2 pl m 2 without tiller removal and the few ones of plots at 4 pl m 2 was the sum of estimated growth rates of main shoot and tillers around silking date of each structure ear biomass was assumed to be negligible at 227 cd before silking date of the apical ear of each shoot otegui and bonhomme 1998 the growth rate of an infertile tiller a tiller not reaching silking was estimated as the slope of the linear regression fitted to estimated vegetative biomass of that tiller at the pre silking silking and post silking measurement dates of the main shoot and time in days from sowing following echarte et al 2004 the relationship between knp and pgrf was investigated using a nonlinear model eq 3 for each data set of tillered and non tillered plants this model includes parameters with biological meaning 3 knp f 1 exp pgr f g h if pgr f g knp 0 if pgr f g where parameter f quantifies potential knp parameter h is a measure of the curvilinearity of the knp pgrf relationship a large h value indicates that the curve approaches a straight line parameter g g pl 1 d 1 represents the pgrf threshold for kernel set below which knp 0 a single parameter g value was tested both for tillered and non tillered plants by fitting the model described in eq 3 obeying to the different maximum number of ears per plant of tillered and non tillered plants independent values for parameters f and h were explored for both groups of plants the functions were fitted using graphpad prism graphpad prism version 6 00 for windows 2020 2 3 simulations of the effect of tillers pl 1 on kernel set at the canopy level the knp pgrf functions for non tillered and tillered plants section 2 2 3 were used to estimate knp based on the output pgrf of each simulation run mentioned in section 2 1 3 however knp was estimated only when the simulated pgrf was within the domains of the empirical models runs with low or very high pgrf were not common and were not considered for the knp prediction kn m 2 was estimated as the product of knp and the plant population density kn m 2 knp x 2 pl m 2 hence for every combination of tillering situation available soil water content at sowing and location we simulated the cumulative frequency of kn m 2 characterizing the reproductive success of the crop differences in kn m 2 between i 2 tillers pl 1 vs 0 tillers pl 1 and ii 1 tiller pl 1 vs 0 tillers pl 1 were estimated for every combination of available soil water content at sowing location and year and the cumulative frequency of these differences were estimated 3 results 3 1 the simulated effect of tillers on water economy and crop growth in maize the simulated period from sowing to flowering lasted around 71 and 74 days for the argentinean and australian locations respectively while the period from sowing to maturity was of 141 to 134 days respectively table s3 locations of australia were warmer than those of argentina but with similar daily solar radiation values table s3 considering cumulative rainfalls during maize growing season tulloona australia was the driest location ca 264 mm and only in coronel suárez argentina rainfalls exceeds 400 mm table s3 rainfall in argentina was evenly distributed ca 50 between pre and post flowering periods while 54 of rainfall in australia occurred during the pre flowering period table s3 the simulated frequency of no water limitation environments envt1 with zero tillers pl 1 was low in all locations 20 fig 1 except for gatton 29 and warwick 42 there was a higher simulated frequency of low water limitation environments envt1 envt2 in the australian locations 51 69 compared to the argentinean ones 10 44 which in turn showed a higher simulated frequency of seasonal water limitation environments envt3 20 36 vs 0 8 in australia there were also differences among selected locations of each country in the patterns of simulated environment types these patterns describe the marginal condition of these locations for maize production due to the high simulated frequencies of severe water limitation during flowering bordenave and barrow and or after kernel set tulloona and gatton or the high inter annual variability of the different environment types coronel suárez gatton and tulloona the simulated frequency of envt1 and envt2 all locations or envt5 barrow and bordenave decreased 0 7 to 7 5 of envt1 per unit increase of tillers pl 1 across all locations 0 6 to 7 0 of envt2 per unit increase of tillers pl 1 across all locations 8 0 of envt5 per unit increase of tillers pl 1 in barrow and bordenave and the simulated frequency of envt4 all locations increased with tiller number 4 0 8 4 of envt4 per unit increase of tillers pl 1 across all locations this response could reflect the effect of tillers on an earlier depletion of soil water supply by the higher crop water demand since initial stages of the cycle in general as tiller number increased so did simulated laif fig 2 however differences were smaller in drier locations and years within each location x available soil water content at sowing e g see coronel suárez 50 vs coronel suárez 90 or barrow 50 vs barrow 90 a wide range of laif values were simulated among locations at each location x available soil water content condition inter annual variability of simulated laif was also higher for crops with 2 tillers pl 1 cv 8 54 p10 0 39 2 61 p90 2 47 3 44 than for non tillered crops cv 1 37 p10 0 48 1 48 p90 1 50 1 92 reflecting differences between conditions in vegetative plasticity promoted by tillering and its modulation by the environment a positive impact of tillers pl 1 on simulated etapf fig 3 was mainly detected in the least restrictive location of argentina coronel suárez and in the three locations of australia especially for crops with higher soil water content at sowing see 70 and 90 and for the higher values of simulated etapf see p50 or higher interestingly the marginal effect of every unitary increase in tillers pl 1 on simulated etapf was increasingly smaller by contrast in drier environments location x initial soil water content x year an increase in tillers pl 1 had almost no effect on simulated etapf in all locations i simulated trpf etapf was higher for tillered crops than for non tillered crops ii differences in simulated trpf etapf between tillered and non tillered crops were higher in wetter environments than in drier ones and iii the marginal impact of tillering on the difference in simulated trpf etapf decreased with the increase in tiller number fig 4 furthermore for the highest available soil water content at sowing of each location inter annual variability of simulated trpf etapf was more variable for non tillered than for tillered crops simulated values of aswf were higher in wetter environments location x available soil water content at sowing and lower in drier ones fig 5 simulated aswf of tillered crops was lower than that of non tillered crops especially in wetter environments locations x available soil water content at sowing and or years without differences in drier environments and or years the marginal impact of tiller number pl 1 on simulated aswf decreased as tiller number increased in drier locations and years simulated pgrf was not affected by tiller number pl 1 and resulted lower but more variable among years than in wetter environments locations x soil water content at sowing fig 6 the higher cv of simulated pgrf in wetter environments was mainly driven by the higher impact of tillering on pgrf 3 2 the empirical relationship between knp and pgrf for tillered and non tillered maize plants the explored range of pgrf recorded in field experiments from 2 8 16 7 g pl 1 d 1 fig 7 was similar to the range of simulated values of pgrf fig 6 within this range there was a crossover of the knp pgrf functions fitted to data set of tillered and non tillered plants reflected in the different values of parameters f and h estimated through eq 3 fig 7 at high pgrf 7 g pl 1 d 1 tillered plants set significantly higher kernels than non tillered plants different reproductive plasticity larger values of f and h parameters i e more potential knp and more linear response of knp to pgrf however at lower pgrf non tillered plants set higher kernels than tillered plants 3 3 the simulated effect of tillering on kernel number at the canopy level frequencies of simulated kn m 2 values of non tillering crops were higher than those of tillering crops in drier locations and years or in lower available soil water content at sowing within locations but lower in the wetter environments location x available soil water content at sowing x year with differences between locations in the probability of having 50 70 or 90 available soil water content at sowing figs 8 and 9 this pattern expressed the differences in the knp pgrf functions fitted to tillered and non tillered plants shown in fig 7 there were differences between non tillered and tillered crops in the stability of simulated kn m 2 across years cv 12 32 with 0 tillers pl 1 16 45 with 1 tiller pl 1 and 19 47 with 2 tillers pl 1 but with few differences between 1 and 2 tillers pl 1 frequencies of positive differences in simulated kn m 2 of tillered crops vs non tillered crops were higher than 0 50 and increased as available soil water content at sowing varied from 50 to 90 in coronel suárez argentina and in all locations in australia fig 9 additionally in these locations during wetter conditions a different contribution of one or two tillers to kn m 2 was also estimated especially for differences in simulated kn m 2 greater than 500 kernels differences in simulated kn m 2 promoted by tillers tended to be reduced in barrow and bordenave and frequencies of negative impacts of tillering on simulated kn m 2 were high and increased as available soil water content at sowing decreased 4 discussion maize is one of the most sensitive summer crops to water stress singh and singh 1995 sadras and milroy 1996 this fact takes superlative importance for maize production under rainfed conditions which is highly represented in several countries such as argentina and australia the environments for rainfed maize production may be characterized by i a high concentration of annual rainfalls during the summer seasons monsoon type climate ii those ones where differences between rainfalls and potential evapotranspiration are similar along the year total rainfalls are greater than 900 mm but with a seasonal summer drought isohydric type climate with a dry season iii those ones with a high distribution of rainfalls around spring and a terminal drought season and iv those ones with low annual rainfalls and a high interannual variability of rainfalls unevenly distributed among years i e marginal environments particularly this work was focused on maize production in iv environments where farmers grow maize crops with defensive productive strategies such as low plant density rodriguez et al 2017 rotili et al 2019 hence our first analysis was centered on the water economy of maize crops in six representative locations of the marginal productive zones of argentina and australia the approach developed by hammer et al 2014 from apsim simulations was useful to differentiate among locations and countries in terms of environmental types of soil water supply crop demand ratio with a probabilistic quantification fig 1 for example there were higher simulated probabilities of environment types of low water limitation in australian locations compared to those of argentina however the approach describes the marginal condition of most of these locations for maize production in both countries due to the high simulated frequencies of severe water limitation during flowering bordenave and barrow and or after kernel set tulloona and gatton or the high inter annual variability of the different environment types coronel suárez gatton and tulloona particularly warwick australia had the highest simulated frequencies of very low water limitation and low terminal water limitation environment types ca 70 apsim model coupled with hammer et al 2014 approach also allowed to analyze tillering effect on lai and water economy for low density maize production in marginal regions althoguh vegetative plasticity is low in maize maddonni et al 2001 when compared with other summer annual crops such as sunflower that can greatly expand its leaves sadras and hall 1988 soybean that can generate branches parvez et al 1989 or sorghum which produces tillers lafarge et al 2002 tillers of maize can also contribute to lai at low plant population densities tetio kagho and gardner 1988 sangoi et al 2011 surprisingly tillering effect on water economy was never documented in maize and to the best of our knowledge the only reference in sorghum the typical summer tillering crop cultivated in water restricted environments was a test of the effect of tiller removal 0 tillers pl 1 versus many tillers pl 1 on the water extraction patterns at different soil depths in a one year experiment robertson et al 1993 the negative effect of water stress during vegetative stages of maize crops on lai generation is well known e g cakir 2004 but comparisons of water stress effect on lai of tillered and non tillered maize crops have never been documented in this work simulations with a low plant population density setting suggest that sensibility of laif to changes in the available soil water content at sowing or to the seasonal conditions years was the greatest for tillered crops fig 2 as was reported for sorghum under field conditions lafarge et al 2002 the highest reduction of simulated laif in dry conditions of tillered crops probably obeyed to the timing of the onset of water limitations during the crop cycle and the different temporal patterns of leaf expansion from main shoots and tillers sangoi et al 2011 on the other hand in humid conditions low density crops with the highest tiller number attained laif values close to the maximum reported laif of mid high density maize crops i e 4 5 maddonni et al 2001 by contrast the low simulated laif of non tillered crops reflect the rigid vegetative plasticity of maize as shown in several other mensurative works maddonni et al 2001 valentinuz and tollenaar 2006 in annual crops including maize actual evapotranspiration is strongly determined by lai kristensen 1974 al kaisi et al 1989 even in sparse canopies i e low population densities kato et al 2004 all information on maize regarding the effect of lai on actual evapotranspiration is based on experiments in which lai varied either with season liu et al 2002 crop age al kaisi et al 1989 kang et al 2003 or plant population density gardiol et al 2003 tahiri et al 2006 but never due to tillering in our study simulated etapf increased with tiller number fig 3 in humid environments due to the higher lai nonetheless in drier environments simulated etapf did not vary with tiller number thus in the more humid locations conditions simulated trpf etapf increased with tiller number fig 4 obeying to a higher laif probably the difference in simulated trpf etapf among tiller numbers within each location was exacerbated in wet years when the limit to vegetative plasticity of single shoot crops meant that a great part of the abundant water was lost by evaporation the unproductive component of evapotranspiration some considerations should be made regarding the results of the effect of tillers on vegetative plasticity of maize and its link with crop water economy based on simulations other authors have also used simulation models to make prospective insights about hypotheses involving the effect of specific crop traits on water economy hammer et al 2009 carretero et al 2014 although useful as a conceptual framework simulation outputs of the effect of tiller leaf area on etapf should be experimentally studied in the future when compared to a non tillered crop a tillered one could present a different distribution of leaves in the space i e clumping the growth of independent root structures and a vascular connection between main shoot and tillers alofe and schrader 1975 yoshida and yoshida 1977 consequently the actual energetical relationship between radiation interception and water evapotranspiration sinclair et al 1984 could be different when a similar lai is generated with tillered plants or by adding more single shoot plants as simulated with apsim model manipulative field experiments should be conducted to test this hypothesis but the occurrence of such high variability of environment types between sites and years fig 1 is difficult to be covered with field experiments because of the simulated positive effect of tillers on etapf in the more humid environments simulated aswf decreased in tillered crops fig 5 however that did not appear to limit crop growth as simulated pgrf increased with tiller number pl 1 fig 6 suggesting that in humid conditions non tillered crops would be limited to capture the available resources mainly incident solar radiation by contrast in most dry environments simulated pgrf were similar for non tillered and tillered crops the implications of aswf on the growth of the different vegetative structures that compose pgrf i e main shoot and tillers must be analyzed from a crop physiology perspective in maize knp depends on pgrf andrade et al 1999 2002 the relationship between these variables always fitted to non tillered plants is curvilinear presents a sterility threshold i e a minimum pgrf value below which knp 0 vega et al 2001 and some genotypes can set kernels on the sub apical ear of main shoot at high pgrf echarte et al 2004 ciancio et al 2016 the relationship fitted to knp and pgrf for tillered and non tillered plants in our field experiments fig 7 had a similar threshold pgrf value for kernel set as previously reported in the literature andrade et al 1999 2002 vega et al 2001 mayer et al 2012 ciancio et al 2016 at intermediate low pgrf i e less than 7 g pl 1 d 1 non tillered plants attained higher knp than tillered plants probably the main shoots of tillered plants were growing at a slower rate compared to main shoots of the non tillered plants harnessing their kernel set and tillers would probably be growing at very slow rates being sterile or setting very few kernels alofe and schrader 1975 at higher pgrf i e more than 7 g pl 1 d 1 non tillered plants set the maximum kernel number on the apical and sub apical ears of the main shoot while tillered plants were able to set more kernels by a higher number of reproductive structures i e reproductive plasticity increasing knp finally we tried to scale up simulations of pgrf to the canopy level particularly to kn m 2 which highly correlates with maize crop grain yield cirilo and andrade 1994 otegui 1995 linking the pgrf output of the simulations with the empirical knp pgrf functions and affecting knp by plant density allowed us to estimate kn m 2 and the differences in kn m 2 between tillered and non tillered crops figs 8 and 9 although simulated pgrf was similar between tillering treatments in dry environments the limitation of plant growth given by limited water availability would generate carbon to be distributed between different shoots main shoot tillers harnessing as mentioned above the reproductive efficiency of the tillered crops therefore simulated kn m 2 of non tillered crops outperformed simulated kn m 2 of tillered crops in the driest locations barrow and bordenave almost every year while in other locations simulated kn m 2 of non tillered crops was higher than that of tillered crops in the drier years and the opposite occurred in wetter years the low stability i e high cv in simulated kn m 2 of tillered crops across years highlights the responsiveness of the tillering process to improvements in the water condition i e the plasticity that tillering crops have in establishing kernels may allow to copy the variation of water availability among years observed in environments with high inter annual variation of rainfalls consequently the simulated effect of tillers on kn m 2 of low density maize crops would not be due to an anticipated depletion of water from the soil profile but to the environmental resource availability and the characteristics of the physiological response of knp to pgrf in the more humid environments probably a higher plant population density would be recommended to achieve a higher kn m 2 however in regions where summer rainfalls have low predictability the generally risk averse farmers choose to use low plant populations to avoid crop failure rotili et al 2019 2020 interestingly given a low plant population density the trade off between the higher potential increases in kn m 2 of tillered maize crops in humid years and the lower potential decreases in drier years when compared to non tillered crops suggests that farmers could benefit more by choosing tillering maize genotypes in the long term kernel weight was not measured in the experiments and the possible differences of kernel weight between kernels of tillers and main shoots should be addressed in future works to expand our results of kn m 2 at the crop yield level 5 conclusions crops with increased number of tillers per unit area had higher simulated laif especially in more humid environments and that allowed for higher water consumption however in drier environments simulated etapf did not differ between crops with different tiller number consequently simulated pgrf was higher in the higher tiller number treatments in the more humid environments but similar between treatments in the drier environments in drier environments kn m 2 of non tillered crops outperformed tillered crops in most years while in the more humid ones the response was the opposite in locations with intermediate mean and highly variable rainfall tillered crops had higher simulated kn m 2 in about half of the years and the potential benefits of tillering in humid years through both vegetative and reproductive plasticity were higher than the potential losses in dry years this was a first step on understanding the effect of tillers on key crop processes especially critical on water economy of low density maize crops future work should consider these findings and experimentally explore the functional basis of

10368,in semi arid production regions having a high inter annual rainfall variability farmers use low plant densities that promote tillering in maize zea mays l tillering in maize is a scarcely researched trait even though it offers vegetative and reproductive plasticity however the production of tillered maize crops may be risky due to a possible early soil water depletion and or low reproductive efficiency here we explored the potential effects of tillers 0 1 and 2 tillers pl 1 on the water economy plant growth and kernel set of maize crops at a low plant density 2 pl m 2 through the combination of simulations using an adapted version of apsim sorghum model and field experiments the simulated scenarios included six locations across argentina and australia and three levels of available soil water content at sowing 50 70 and 90 in humid environments simulated crops with increased number of tillers pl 1 expressed high vegetative plasticity up to three fold increases in leaf

number per plant knp i e reproductive plasticity sangoi et al 2011 however in dry environments where farmers use defensive strategies i e low plant populations tillers may be seen as an undesirable vegetative structure for example plant spatial arrangements that promoted tillering in maize showed lower values of water use efficiency for total biomass or grain yield kapanigowda et al 2010 allen 2012 possibly tillers cause higher soil water consumption during early stages of the crop cycle due to an increased crop transpiration thus reducing soil water availability towards the critical period for kernel set i e approximately 30 days bracketing female flowering kiniry and ritchie 1985 cerrudo et al 2013 although experimental data provide important evidence experiments carried out during a reduced number of growing seasons can be misleading especially when facing high seasonal climate variability functional simulation models such as apsim www apsim info holzworth et al 2014 which use soil data and historical climate records capturing the inter annual variability of rainfalls can aid in the characterization of crop water economy variables such as cumulative transpiration and evapotranspiration during the pre flowering period or available soil water content at flowering however at present there is no maize model capable of simulating tillers apsim sorghum hammer et al 2010 does contain a tillering routine and it also estimates the dynamics of the crop water supply crop demand providing a measure of the intensity and timing of water limitation in relation to crop development i e the environment type hammer et al 2014 apsim sorghum can be re programmed parameterized and validated with cautions to simulate a tillering maize then it would be possible to explore in a dynamic manner the effect of tillers on crop water economy in target environments another advantage of using the apsim simulation framework is its functional capacity to simulate kernel number per square meter kn m 2 that in maize is correlated with crop yield cirilo and andrade 1994 otegui 1995 that is the result of plant density and knp knp depends on plant growth rate around flowering pgrf andrade et al 1999 2002 pgrf is an indicator of the amount of carbon available to the plants source and a good predictor of the capacity of maize plants to set kernels sink under a wide range of environmental conditions water deficiencies n deficiencies shading and management practices andrade et al 2002 knp pgrf functions have been reported for single shoot single or multiple eared genotypes tollenaar et al 1992 andrade et al 1999 2002 vega et al 2001 echarte et al 2004 ciancio et al 2016 but none for tillering genotypes an individual plant approach to determine this function for a tillering genotype combined with a crop simulation exercise using apsim could provide clues regarding the effect of tillers on crop water economy plant growth and kernel set in low density maize crops understanding these processes is crucial to guide breeding programs and crop management in production environments where low plant population densities are likely to promote tillering the objectives of this work were i using apsim to predict the effect of tillers on vegetative plasticity water economy and pgrf in low density maize crops for three locations across the southwestern pampas of argentina and three locations across the main dryland maize production region of australia in queensland and new south wales setting three contrasting levels of available soil water content at sowing ii through field experiments to parameterize the relationship between knp and pgrf for a tillering maize genotype including tillered and non tillered plants and iii to explore the effect of seasonal climate variability on kernel number m 2 for tillered and non tillered crops in the different environmental conditions explored based on the simulated pgrf values and the function described in ii 2

derived experimentally see section 2 2 apsim sorghum and apsim maize use the same base functions to simulate growth and development with specific differences on the leaf area and leaf senescence functions in apsim sorghum the user selects the number of tillers per plant that reach flowering tillers appear sequentially starting from floral initiation and have fewer and smaller leaves ca 75 than main shoots the model does not consider tiller death every tiller eventually reaches its total development number of leaves and maximum height as was also observed in the experiments mentioned in section 2 2 the tillering routine is not present in apsim maize at the time of writing the base values of parameters of growth and development included in apsim maize were set in apsim sorghum and comparisons of growth development and soil water content were performed between both models comparisons were made using the same values for shared parameters between models and adjusting the values of the leaf area and leaf senescence functions in apsim sorghum to minimize the error in lai estimation relative to that of apsim maize when simulating a non tillering crop lai at flowering laif apsim

mentioned in section 2 2 fig s1 the phenology parameters used in australia were those of the hybrid pioneer 3153 used to characterize the potential maize production area of that country in chauhan et al 2013 in argentina the phenology parameters were set to match flowering and physiological maturity dates for each location to those in rotili et al 2019 a detail of the phenology parameters used can be found in table s2 the values of weather variables during the crop cycle in each location from the historical climatic series of 32 years 1983 2014 considered in the simulations are shown in table

argentina typical situations in each region nitrogen fertilization of 150 kg n ha 1 at sowing was simulated to minimize n restriction for crop growth sowing date was set according to the common practices in each region october 1 in australia and november 20 in argentina a low population density of 2 pl m 2 commonly found in fields of farmers using defensive strategies and that promotes tiller emission tetio kagho and gardner 1988 was used in all simulations treatments were the factorial combination of three tillering patterns 0 1 and 2 tillers pl 1 and three levels of available soil water content at sowing 50 70 and 90 of total soil water holding capacity these soil water content values were chosen after running simulations using a climatic series of 32 years in each location 1983 2014 starting with an initial soil water content of 15 filled from the top soil horizon to the bottom soil horizon on january 1 in australia and on april 1 in argentina typical harvesting dates of the previous wheat and soybean crops respectively due to the high interannual variability of autumn winter and early spring rainfalls in each location there was a different probability of having 50 70 or 90 of available soil water content at sowing each simulation ended on the physiological maturity date of the maize crop and for each run the soil water n and residue pools were reset at sowing for every combination of location 6 tillering situation 3 and available soil water content 3 at sowing a 32 year simulation was run 2 1 3 simulation outputs the method described in hammer et al 2014

frequency of each environment type at each location number of years of each environment type 96 simulations for non tillered crops and the effect of tillers on the frequency of these water limitation patterns were calculated other simulation outputs of crop water economy variables for every combination of tillering situation available soil water content at sowing and location were the cumulative frequency of i aswf characterizing remaining soil water supply during the most critical stage of the crop cycle for yield determination ii crop actual total evapotranspiration until flowering etapf characterizing crop water consumption during the pre flowering period and iii the ratio between crop transpiration and crop actual evapotranspiration until flowering trpf etapf characterizing the partition between transpiration a productive component and evaporation an unproductive component of crop water consumption also for every combination of tillering situation available soil water content at sowing and location we simulated the cumulative frequency of iv laif characterizing vegetative plasticity and v pgrf differences across locations and within locations across values of available soil water content at sowing were compared either using the median p50 the lower p10 or higher p90 percentiles of the cumulative frequency distributions of the different simulated variables as well as the coefficient of variation cv as a measurement of interannual variability within treatments 2 2 field experiments field experiments were established to i confirm that apsim tillering routine adequately resembles the evolution of biomass to flowering of maize crops with different tiller number and ii to parameterize the relationship between knp and pgrf for non tillered maize plants andrade et al 1999 2002 vega et al 2001 echarte et al 2004 ciancio et al 2016 and tillered maize plants never documented before contrasting plant densities and levels of n availability were used to obtain a wide range of pgrf in both tillered plants and non tillered plants encompassing the pgrf values obtained from apsim simulations see section 2 3 2 2 1 crop management a tillering prone semi dent commercial maize hybrid ax7784 vt3p from nidera semillas sa tolerant to glyphosate n phosphonomethyl glycine and widely used by farmers in argentina was cultivated during two growing seasons 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 at the experimental field of the department of plant production university of buenos aires argentina 34 35 s 58 29 w on a deep silty clay loam soil vertic argiudoll soil science division staff 2017 the hybrid was cultivated at two plant densities 2 and 4 pl m 2 with rows 0 5 m apart from each other an additional plot cultivated at 2 pl m 2 was included in each block where tillers were removed immediately after their emergence the 2 pl m 2 plots involved eight rows and the 4 pl m 2 plots involved six rows with all plots being 10 m long the design was a split plot randomized complete block design with three replicates with n treatment in the main plot and the combination of tiller removal and plant density in the sub plot the experiments were manually sown on november 17 2017 and november 6 2018 to ensure the stand of plants three seeds per hill were sown and later thinned by hand to one plant per site at the one ligulated leaf stage v1 ritchie et al 1993 in both years native soil nitrogen at sowing 0 0 6 m depth was 60 kg n ha 1 after sowing half of the plots were fertilized with urea 46 0 0 to reach 220 kg n ha 1 giving two contrasting initial soil nitrogen availabilities weeds were chemically controlled using atrazine 2 5 kg ha 1 acetochlor 3 5 l ha 1 and halosulfuron methyl 120 g ha 1 before crop emergence and glyphosate 2 5 l ha 1 after crop emergence insect injury was managed chemically using flubendiamide 80 ml ha 1 no disease incidence was registered in any of the two experiments but intense rainfall events occurred during the initial vegetative stages of the second experimental season caused growth restriction during several days due to flooding except for the mentioned flooding event in the second experimental season soil moisture remained close to field capacity throughout the crop cycle by drip irrigation in both experiments 2 2 2 measurements twelve consecutive plants of equal size and similar ontogenic stage were tagged at v3 in six central rows of the 2 pl m 2 plots with and without tiller removal or in four central rows of the 4 pl m 2 plots for each plant the number of ligulated leaves vn stages was recorded weekly in both the main shoot and tillers when they were present daily observations of silk exertion from the apical ear of both the main shoot and tillers of each tagged plant were performed and the silking date of each ear was recorded when at least one silk per ear was visible non destructive allometric models were used to estimate vegetative biomass of each tagged plant at i ca 15 days before silking of the apical ear of the main shoot ii silking of the apical ear of the main shoot iii silking of the apical ear of tillers iv 15 days after silking date of the apical ear of the main shoot and v 15 days after silking of the apical ear of tillers on each main shoot or tiller measurements involved maximum and minimum stem base diameter and height from the ground level to the insertion of the last expanded leaf allometric models were also used to estimate biomass of the apical and sub apical ear of the main shoot and tiller of each tagged plant at silking date of apical ear and 15 days after that date using measurements of the maximum diameter of the ears measurements of stem or ear diameter were taken with an electronic digital vernier caliper while the measurements of shoot height were taken with a tape measure total plant biomass at silking date of the apical ear and 15 days after that date was computed as the sum of estimated vegetative biomass in the main shoot and tillers and those of the apical and the sub apical ears this non destructive technique has been widely used in maize to estimate pgrf of tagged plants remaining in the field until harvest in both non prolific and prolific maize genotypes andrade et al 1999 vega et al 2001 echarte et al 2004 rossini et al 2011 laserna et al 2012 ciancio et al 2016 this methodology was never used before to estimate biomass of maize plants with tillers during both experiments plants of each hybrid were sampled ca 70 plants per ontogenic stage 855 total main shoots 558 main shoot ears 710 tillers and 323 tiller ears throughout several ontogenic stages including the ones described for the tagged plants table 1 non destructive allometric measurements described above were performed on the main shoot tillers and ears when they were present of these sampled plants immediately after measurements plants were separated in main shoot and tillers and the vegetative stalk leaves tassel and reproductive husks cob florets biomass of each shoot category main shoot and tillers was identified biomass was oven dried at 65 c until constant weight allometric relationships were established between morphometric variables and dry weights of main shoots tillers and ears vegetative biomass stalk leaves tassel of main shoots or tillers was estimated based on a quadratic function eq 1 fitted to shoot dry weight and stem volume table 1 and fig s2 considering the equation of cylinder volume vol cm3 1 vegetative biomass g a b vol cm 3 c vol cm 3 2 where a is the y intercept fixed at zero to be biologically meaningful b is the parameter of the linear term and c is the parameter of the quadratic term biomass of the apical and sub apical ear husks cob florets at silking date of apical ear and 15 days after that date was estimated with an exponential function eq 2 fitted to ear dry weight and maximum ear diameter mm of sampled ears of main shoot and tillers table 1 and fig s2 2 apical or sub apical ear biomass g d e x m m where d and e are the parameters of the exponential term and x is the ear diameter mm at physiological maturity tagged plants were individually harvested and kernel number of each ear was counted manually knp was calculated as the sum of kernels of every ear of main shoot and tillers in each plant kernel like structures in the tassels of the tillers moulia et al 1999 were not considered as they are non marketable due to the exposition to pests and weather conditions because of the lack of husks 2 2 3 functional relationships between knp and pgrf of tillered and on tillered plants in both experiments there was some delay ca 7 days between silking in the apical ears of main shoot and silking of apical ears of tillers pgrf for non tillered plants those of plots at 2 pl m 2 where tillers were removed or those ones naturally without tillers at 2 4 pl m 2 was estimated from the slope of the linear regression fitted to estimated plant biomass vegetative reproductive biomass at three stages 227 cd ca 15 days before silking date of the apical ear silking date of the apical ear and 15 days after silking date of the apical ear and time in days from sowing pgrf of tillered plant mostly those plants of plots at 2 pl m 2 without tiller removal and the few ones of plots at 4 pl m 2 was the sum of estimated growth rates of main shoot and tillers around silking date of each structure ear biomass was assumed to be negligible at 227 cd before silking date of the apical ear of each shoot otegui and bonhomme 1998 the growth rate of an infertile tiller a tiller not reaching silking was estimated as the slope of the linear regression fitted to estimated vegetative biomass of that tiller at the pre silking silking and post silking measurement dates of the main shoot and time in days from sowing following echarte et al 2004 the relationship between knp and pgrf was investigated using a nonlinear model eq 3 for each data set of tillered and non tillered plants this model includes parameters with biological meaning 3 knp f 1 exp pgr f g h if pgr f g knp 0 if pgr f g where parameter f quantifies potential knp parameter h is a measure of the curvilinearity of the knp pgrf relationship a large h value indicates that the curve approaches a straight line parameter g g pl 1 d 1 represents the pgrf threshold for kernel set below which knp 0 a single parameter g value was tested both for tillered and non tillered plants by fitting the model described in eq 3 obeying to the different maximum number of ears per plant of tillered and non tillered plants independent values for parameters f and h were explored for both groups of plants the functions were fitted using graphpad prism graphpad prism version 6 00 for windows 2020 2 3 simulations of the effect of tillers pl 1 on kernel set at the canopy level the knp pgrf functions for non tillered and tillered plants section 2 2 3 were used to estimate knp based on the output pgrf of each simulation run mentioned in section 2 1 3 however knp was estimated only when the simulated pgrf was within the domains of the empirical models runs with low or very high pgrf were not common and were not considered for the knp prediction kn m 2 was estimated as the product of knp and the plant population density kn m 2 knp x 2 pl m 2 hence for every combination of tillering situation available soil water content at sowing and location we simulated the cumulative frequency of kn m 2 characterizing the reproductive success of the crop differences in kn m 2 between i 2 tillers pl 1 vs 0 tillers pl 1 and ii 1 tiller pl 1 vs 0 tillers pl 1 were estimated for every combination of available soil water content at sowing location and year and the cumulative frequency of these differences were estimated 3 results 3 1 the simulated effect of tillers on water economy and crop growth in maize the simulated period from sowing to flowering lasted around 71 and 74 days for the argentinean and australian locations respectively while the period from sowing to maturity was of 141 to 134 days respectively table s3 locations of australia were warmer than those of argentina but with similar daily solar radiation values table s3 considering cumulative rainfalls during maize growing season tulloona australia was the driest location ca 264 mm and only in coronel suárez argentina rainfalls exceeds 400 mm table s3 rainfall in argentina was evenly distributed ca 50 between pre and post flowering periods while 54 of rainfall in australia occurred during the pre flowering period table s3 the simulated frequency of no water limitation environments envt1 with zero tillers pl 1 was low in all locations 20 fig 1 except for gatton 29 and warwick 42 there was a higher simulated frequency of low water limitation environments envt1 envt2 in the australian locations 51 69 compared to the argentinean ones 10 44 which in turn showed a higher simulated frequency of seasonal water limitation environments envt3 20 36 vs 0 8 in australia there were also differences among selected locations of each country in the patterns of simulated environment types these patterns describe the marginal condition of these locations for maize production due to the high simulated frequencies of severe water limitation during flowering bordenave and barrow and or after kernel set tulloona and gatton or the high inter annual variability of the different environment types coronel suárez gatton and tulloona the simulated frequency of envt1 and envt2 all locations or envt5 barrow and bordenave decreased 0 7 to 7 5 of envt1 per unit increase of tillers pl 1 across all locations 0 6 to 7 0 of envt2 per unit increase of tillers pl 1 across all locations 8 0 of envt5 per unit increase of tillers pl 1 in barrow and bordenave and the simulated frequency of envt4 all locations increased with tiller number 4 0 8 4 of envt4 per unit increase of tillers pl 1 across all locations this response could reflect the effect of tillers on an earlier depletion of soil water supply by the higher crop water demand since initial stages of the cycle in general as tiller number increased so did simulated laif fig 2 however differences were smaller in drier locations and years within each location x available soil water content at sowing e g see coronel suárez 50 vs coronel suárez 90 or barrow 50 vs barrow 90 a wide range of laif values were simulated among locations at each location x available soil water content condition inter annual variability of simulated laif was also higher for crops with 2 tillers pl 1 cv 8 54 p10 0 39 2 61 p90 2 47 3 44 than for non tillered crops cv 1 37 p10 0 48 1 48 p90 1 50 1 92 reflecting differences between conditions in vegetative plasticity promoted by tillering and its modulation by the environment a positive impact of tillers pl 1 on simulated etapf fig 3 was mainly detected in the least restrictive location of argentina coronel suárez and in the three locations of australia especially for crops with higher soil water content at sowing see 70 and 90 and for the higher values of simulated etapf see p50 or higher interestingly the marginal effect of every unitary increase in tillers pl 1 on simulated etapf was increasingly smaller by contrast in drier environments location x initial soil water content x year an increase in tillers pl 1 had almost no effect on simulated etapf in all locations i simulated trpf etapf was higher for tillered crops than for non tillered crops ii differences in simulated trpf etapf between tillered and non tillered crops were higher in wetter environments than in drier ones and iii the marginal impact of tillering on the difference in simulated trpf etapf decreased with the increase in tiller number fig 4 furthermore for the highest available soil water content at sowing of each location inter annual variability of simulated trpf etapf was more variable for non tillered than for tillered crops simulated values of aswf were higher in wetter environments location x available soil water content at sowing and lower in drier ones fig 5 simulated aswf of tillered crops was lower than that of non tillered crops especially in wetter environments locations x available soil water content at sowing and or years without differences in drier environments and or years the marginal impact of tiller number pl 1 on simulated aswf decreased as tiller number increased in drier locations and years simulated pgrf was not affected by tiller number pl 1 and resulted lower but more variable among years than in wetter environments locations x soil water content at sowing fig 6 the higher cv of simulated pgrf in wetter environments was mainly driven by the higher impact of tillering on pgrf 3 2 the empirical relationship between knp and pgrf for tillered and non tillered maize plants the explored range of pgrf recorded in field experiments from 2 8 16 7 g pl 1 d 1 fig 7 was similar to the range of simulated values of pgrf fig 6 within this range there was a crossover of the knp pgrf functions fitted to data set of tillered and non tillered plants reflected in the different values of parameters f and h estimated through eq 3 fig 7 at high pgrf 7 g pl 1 d 1 tillered plants set significantly higher kernels than non tillered plants different reproductive plasticity larger values of f and h parameters i e more potential knp and more linear response of knp to pgrf however at lower pgrf non tillered plants set higher kernels than tillered plants 3 3 the simulated effect of tillering on kernel number at the canopy level frequencies of simulated kn m 2 values of non tillering crops were higher than those of tillering crops in drier locations and years or in lower available soil water content at sowing within locations but lower in the wetter environments location x available soil water content at sowing x year with differences between locations in the probability of having 50 70 or 90 available soil water content at sowing figs 8 and 9 this pattern expressed the differences in the knp pgrf functions fitted to tillered and non tillered plants shown in fig 7 there were differences between non tillered and tillered crops in the stability of simulated kn m 2 across years cv 12 32 with 0 tillers pl 1 16 45 with 1 tiller pl 1 and 19 47 with 2 tillers pl 1 but with few differences between 1 and 2 tillers pl 1 frequencies of positive differences in simulated kn m 2 of tillered crops vs non tillered crops were higher than 0 50 and increased as available soil water content at sowing varied from 50 to 90 in coronel suárez argentina and in all locations in australia fig 9 additionally in these locations during wetter conditions a different contribution of one or two tillers to kn m 2 was also estimated especially for differences in simulated kn m 2 greater than 500 kernels differences in simulated kn m 2 promoted by tillers tended to be reduced in barrow and bordenave and frequencies of negative impacts of tillering on simulated kn m 2 were high and increased as available soil water content at sowing decreased 4 discussion maize is one of the most sensitive summer crops to water stress singh and singh 1995 sadras and milroy 1996 this fact takes superlative importance for maize production under rainfed conditions which is highly represented in several countries such as argentina and australia the environments for rainfed maize production may be characterized by i a high concentration of annual rainfalls during the summer seasons monsoon type climate ii those ones where differences between rainfalls and potential evapotranspiration are similar along the year total rainfalls are greater than 900 mm but with a seasonal summer drought isohydric type climate with a dry season iii those ones with a high distribution of rainfalls around spring and a terminal drought season and iv those ones with low annual rainfalls and a high interannual variability of rainfalls unevenly distributed among years i e marginal environments particularly this work was focused on maize production in iv environments where farmers grow maize crops with defensive productive strategies such as low plant density rodriguez et al 2017 rotili et al 2019 hence our first analysis was centered on the water economy of maize crops in six representative locations of the marginal productive zones of argentina and australia the approach developed by hammer et al 2014 from apsim simulations was useful to differentiate among locations and countries in terms of environmental types of soil water supply crop demand ratio with a probabilistic quantification fig 1 for example there were higher simulated probabilities of environment types of low water limitation in australian locations compared to those of argentina however the approach describes the marginal condition of most of these locations for maize production in both countries due to the high simulated frequencies of severe water limitation during flowering bordenave and barrow and or after kernel set tulloona and gatton or the high inter annual variability of the different environment types coronel suárez gatton and tulloona particularly warwick australia had the highest simulated frequencies of very low water limitation and low terminal water limitation environment types ca 70 apsim model coupled with hammer et al 2014 approach also allowed to analyze tillering effect on lai and water economy for low density maize production in marginal regions althoguh vegetative plasticity is low in maize maddonni et al 2001 when compared with other summer annual crops such as sunflower that can greatly expand its leaves sadras and hall 1988 soybean that can generate branches parvez et al 1989 or sorghum which produces tillers lafarge et al 2002 tillers of maize can also contribute to lai at low plant population densities tetio kagho and gardner 1988 sangoi et al 2011 surprisingly tillering effect on water economy was never documented in maize and to the best of our knowledge the only reference in sorghum the typical summer tillering crop cultivated in water restricted environments was a test of the effect of tiller removal 0 tillers pl 1 versus many tillers pl 1 on the water extraction patterns at different soil depths in a one year experiment robertson et al 1993 the negative effect of water stress during vegetative stages of maize crops on lai generation is well known e g cakir 2004 but comparisons of water stress effect on lai of tillered and non tillered maize crops have never been documented in this work simulations with a low plant population density setting suggest that sensibility of laif to changes in the available soil water content at sowing or to the seasonal conditions years was the greatest for tillered crops fig 2 as was reported for sorghum under field conditions lafarge et al 2002 the highest reduction of simulated laif in dry conditions of tillered crops probably obeyed to the timing of the onset of water limitations during the crop cycle and the different temporal patterns of leaf expansion from main shoots and tillers sangoi et al 2011 on the other hand in humid conditions low density crops with the highest tiller number attained laif values close to the maximum reported laif of mid high density maize crops i e 4 5 maddonni et al 2001 by contrast the low simulated laif of non tillered crops reflect the rigid vegetative plasticity of maize as shown in several other mensurative works maddonni et al 2001 valentinuz and tollenaar 2006 in annual crops including maize actual evapotranspiration is strongly determined by lai kristensen 1974 al kaisi et al 1989 even in sparse canopies i e low population densities kato et al 2004 all information on maize regarding the effect of lai on actual evapotranspiration is based on experiments in which lai varied either with season liu et al 2002 crop age al kaisi et al 1989 kang et al 2003 or plant population density gardiol et al 2003 tahiri et al 2006 but never due to tillering in our study simulated etapf increased with tiller number fig 3 in humid environments due to the higher lai nonetheless in drier environments simulated etapf did not vary with tiller number thus in the more humid locations conditions simulated trpf etapf increased with tiller number fig 4 obeying to a higher laif probably the difference in simulated trpf etapf among tiller numbers within each location was exacerbated in wet years when the limit to vegetative plasticity of single shoot crops meant that a great part of the abundant water was lost by evaporation the unproductive component of evapotranspiration some considerations should be made regarding the results of the effect of tillers on vegetative plasticity of maize and its link with crop water economy based on simulations other authors have also used simulation models to make prospective insights about hypotheses involving the effect of specific crop traits on water economy hammer et al 2009 carretero et al 2014 although useful as a conceptual framework simulation outputs of the effect of tiller leaf area on etapf should be experimentally studied in the future when compared to a non tillered crop a tillered one could present a different distribution of leaves in the space i e clumping the growth of independent root structures and a vascular connection between main shoot and tillers alofe and schrader 1975 yoshida and yoshida 1977 consequently the actual energetical relationship between radiation interception and water evapotranspiration sinclair et al 1984 could be different when a similar lai is generated with tillered plants or by adding more single shoot plants as simulated with apsim model manipulative field experiments should be conducted to test this hypothesis but the occurrence of such high variability of environment types between sites and years fig 1 is difficult to be covered with field experiments because of the simulated positive effect of tillers on etapf in the more humid environments simulated aswf decreased in tillered crops fig 5 however that did not appear to limit crop growth as simulated pgrf increased with tiller number pl 1 fig 6 suggesting that in humid conditions non tillered crops would be limited to capture the available resources mainly incident solar radiation by contrast in most dry environments simulated pgrf were similar for non tillered and tillered crops the implications of aswf on the growth of the different vegetative structures that compose pgrf i e main shoot and tillers must be analyzed from a crop physiology perspective in maize knp depends on pgrf andrade et al 1999 2002 the relationship between these variables always fitted to non tillered plants is curvilinear presents a sterility threshold i e a minimum pgrf value below which knp 0 vega et al 2001 and some genotypes can set kernels on the sub apical ear of main shoot at high pgrf echarte et al 2004 ciancio et al 2016 the relationship fitted to knp and pgrf for tillered and non tillered plants in our field experiments fig 7 had a similar threshold pgrf value for kernel set as previously reported in the literature andrade et al 1999 2002 vega et al 2001 mayer et al 2012 ciancio et al 2016 at intermediate low pgrf i e less than 7 g pl 1 d 1 non tillered plants attained higher knp than tillered plants probably the main shoots of tillered plants were growing at a slower rate compared to main shoots of the non tillered plants harnessing their kernel set and tillers would probably be growing at very slow rates being sterile or setting very few kernels alofe and schrader 1975 at higher pgrf i e more than 7 g pl 1 d 1 non tillered plants set the maximum kernel number on the apical and sub apical ears of the main shoot while tillered plants were able to set more kernels by a higher number of reproductive structures i e reproductive plasticity increasing knp finally we tried to scale up simulations of pgrf to the canopy level particularly to kn m 2 which highly correlates with maize crop grain yield cirilo and andrade 1994 otegui 1995 linking the pgrf output of the simulations with the empirical knp pgrf functions and affecting knp by plant density allowed us to estimate kn m 2 and the differences in kn m 2 between tillered and non tillered crops figs 8 and 9 although simulated pgrf was similar between tillering treatments in dry environments the limitation of plant growth given by limited water availability would generate carbon to be distributed between different shoots main shoot tillers harnessing as mentioned above the reproductive efficiency of the tillered crops therefore simulated kn m 2 of non tillered crops outperformed simulated kn m 2 of tillered crops in the driest locations barrow and bordenave almost every year while in other locations simulated kn m 2 of non tillered crops was higher than that of tillered crops in the drier years and the opposite occurred in wetter years the low stability i e high cv in simulated kn m 2 of tillered crops across years highlights the responsiveness of the tillering process to improvements in the water condition i e the plasticity that tillering crops have in establishing kernels may allow to copy the variation of water availability among years observed in environments with high inter annual variation of rainfalls consequently the simulated effect of tillers on kn m 2 of low density maize crops would not be due to an anticipated depletion of water from the soil profile but to the environmental resource availability and the characteristics of the physiological response of knp to pgrf in the more humid environments probably a higher plant population density would be recommended to achieve a higher kn m 2 however in regions where summer rainfalls have low predictability the generally risk averse farmers choose to use low plant populations to avoid crop failure rotili et al 2019 2020 interestingly given a low plant population density the trade off between the higher potential increases in kn m 2 of tillered maize crops in humid years and the lower potential decreases in drier years when compared to non tillered crops suggests that farmers could benefit more by choosing tillering maize genotypes in the long term kernel weight was not measured in the experiments and the possible differences of kernel weight between kernels of tillers and main shoots should be addressed in future works to expand our results of kn m 2 at the crop yield level 5 conclusions crops with increased number of tillers per unit area had higher simulated laif especially in more humid environments and that allowed for higher water consumption however in drier environments simulated etapf did not differ between crops with different tiller number consequently simulated pgrf was higher in the higher tiller number treatments in the more humid environments but similar between treatments in the drier environments in drier environments kn m 2 of non tillered crops outperformed tillered crops in most years while in the more humid ones the response was the opposite in locations with intermediate mean and highly variable rainfall tillered crops had higher simulated kn m 2 in about half of the years and the potential benefits of tillering in humid years through both vegetative and reproductive plasticity were higher than the potential losses in dry years this was a first step on understanding the effect of tillers on key crop processes especially critical on water economy of low density maize crops future work should consider these findings and experimentally explore the functional basis of

10369,artificial drainage ad in producer fields can help avoid excess water and improve workability and timely fieldwork in comparison with soils that rely on natural drainage nd to date most studies examining the effect of ad on crop yield were conducted at research stations and limited to a few sites and years here we explored the influence of ad on soybean yield across the north central us region nc us which accounts for a third of global soybean production and where ad is widely used to prevent excess water early in the crop season we used two sources of data i records from 2805 soybean producer fields collected via a multi year multi state survey of soybean producers in the nc us region and ii information from 47 site year experiments that included paired ad nd treatment comparisons in all cases ad corresponded to subsurface drainage except for producer fields in north dakota where ad corresponded to surface drainage producer fields were grouped into technology extrapolation domains teds delineating regions with similar climate and soils to allow comparison of yields in ad versus nd fields in the case of subsurface drainage average yield in ad versus nd was 8 higher 275 kg ha 1 and 4 higher 157 kg ha 1 based on analysis of experimental and producer data respectively our analysis indicated that part of the ad nd yield difference in producer fields can be attributed to a shift towards earlier sowing after ad adoption findings from this study explain the wide adoption of ad across the central and eastern areas of the nc us region and provide a basis to determine the productivity and economic impact of ad installation at field and regional level keywords soybean glycine maxl drainage yield excess water 1 introduction excess water early in the crop season may result in extended periods with saturated soil conditions which affect soybean establishment and growth leading to reduced dry matter accumulation and yield oosterhuis et al 1990 linkemer et al 1998 nosetto et al 2009 hatfield et al 2014 bajgain et al 2015 besides the direct effect of excess water through anoxia stand losses higher disease pressure and reduction in n2 fixation bacanamwo and purcell 1999 saturated soil conditions may also delay sowing and plant emergence as it has been documented in previous studies sowing delay can lead to additional yield penalty rowntree et al 2013 rattalino edreira et al 2017 mourtzinis et al 2018 hence managing soil excess water early in the season is essential to avoid yield penalties across years the north central us nc us region includes ca 33 million ha of soybean sown annually usda nass 2017 in its natural state much of the fertile land in this region was either wetland or frequently too wet to allow profitable crop production beauchamp 1987 since the late 19th century artificial drainage ad started to be adopted to allow cultivation and field surveys conducted in the 1940s reported large maize yield increases due to ad adoption sutton 1943 uhland 1944 nowadays ca one third of the cropland in the entire nc us region and up to 70 90 in parts of the central and eastern areas of the region is artificially drained to reduce the risk associated with excess water early in the season usda nass 2017 rizzo et al 2018 castellano et al 2019 subsurface tile drainage is the most common ad method in the region except for the north western region north dakota where surface drainage prevails although tile drainage has recently started to be adopted in eastern north dakota wiersma et al 2010 the purpose of ad is to reduce excess water while improving workability and timely fieldwork in poorly drained soils lal and taylor 1970 zucker and brown 1998 the magnitude of yields derived from adoption of ad depends on timing frequency and duration of saturated soils as influenced by topography precipitation water table depth and their interactions wright and sands 2001 kladivko et al 2004 for example in wet years fields that receive water from upland positions in the landscape i e through surface run on are prone to excess water hence these fields are expected to benefit from ad adoption in contrast the impact is expected to be smaller or nil in dry years and or fields in upper positions of the landscape most studies that have examined the effect of ad to increase crop yield in the nc us region were conducted several decades ago schwab et al 1966 sipp et al 1986 in the case of soybean subsurface ad resulted in 0 4 mg ha 1 greater yield than nd 14 whereas the respective yield increase due to surface ad was 0 3 mg ha 1 11 sipp et al 1986 in the same study no difference was observed between surface and subsurface ad these experiments were conducted at research stations across a limited number of years which results in limited ability to extrapolate results to a wide region similarly management practices have changed drastically over time which would likely influence the yield response to ad e g earlier sowing date no till adoption finally the sites used in those previous studies have been selected based on their probability to favorably respond to ad installation which can bias the evaluation of ad in terms of crop yield response to summarize an assessment of the soybean yield benefits derived from ad adoption in producer fields using current management practices across a wide range of environments is missing we argue that an evaluation of interactions between ad weather and management practices using both experimental and producer data would provide a better understanding of the yield benefit derived from ad adoption in producer fields the objective of this study was to examine the effect of ad on soybean yield as influenced by pre sowing precipitation topography and management practices to do so we used experimental and producer field data collected in nc us region an area that accounts for a third of global soybean production and includes the largest area under soybean cultivation with ad in the world the analysis of experimental and producer survey data across a large number of sites and years allowed us to understand the effect of ad on soybean yield across a wide range of environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 analysis of experimental data we compiled yield and management data from replicated field experiments conducted in iowa missouri minnesota and north dakota during the past 20 years 2002 2019 fig 1 table 1 data from minnesota and north dakota were unpublished whereas subsets of the data from iowa and missouri have been published elsewhere nelson et al 2011 2012 2017 or are available via public data repositories abendroth et al 2017 the database included 47 site year experiments all experiments were rainfed that is they did not receive supplemental irrigation each trial included a side by side comparison of ad versus naturally drained nd treatments design of the drainage systems in these experiments was representative of those commonly installed in producer fields in the nc us region panuska 2015 helmers 2016 although the main focus of these experiments was comparison of ad versus nd most experiments included factorial arrangements to assess the interaction between ad with other factors such as cultivar maturity group mg seeding rate foliar fungicide use tillage and row spacing site year treatments with severe pest infestation or receiving poor management were excluded from the analysis while there was 47 site year experiments combination of site years and treatments resulted in a total of 139 paired observations to evaluate ad versus nd yield differences each paired observation had identical climate soil and management background each experiment reported sowing date mg seeding rate row spacing tillage method use of foliar fungicide and prior crop throughout this article soybean yields are reported at 130 g kg 1 seed moisture content daily precipitation data were retrieved from meteorological stations managed by the mesonet network http mrcc isws illinois edu gismaps mesonets htm located 30 km from the experimental sites and 30 d cumulative precipitation before sowing p 30 was calculated for each site year table 1 the p 30 was considered a reasonable indicator of excess water in the soil and workability of the field early in the season there was a wide range in p 30 values across site years which ranged from 15 to 253 mm table 1 the topography wetness index twi was calculated for each experiment twi has been used to characterize the potential for surface run off and run on in landscapes hence it can be used indirectly to assess the influence of field topography on crop productivity moore et al 1993 high values are associated with flat terrains whereas smaller values are associated with more uneven fields e g fields with slopes higher twi values are generally associated with higher chances that a field will receive surface runoff water and are typically classified as more productive soils twi was calculated using the rsaga wetness index package in r r development core team 2016 using the 30 m resolution national elevation dataset usda nrcs geospatial data gateway https datagateway nrcs usda gov mean twi for a given experiment was derived from the pixel twi distribution within each field field average twi values ranged from 9 8 11 8 across the four locations table 1 the design of the drainage system at each site was determined by researchers based on site specific soil type slope and water table depth while we are aware that drainage system design can influence the yield response to drainage acharya et al 2019 the experimental database did not allow us to evaluate that effect because there was no side by side comparison of different drainage system design in any of the sites across the region the effect of ad was examined using a mixed effect analysis of variance anova ad was used as fixed effect and site year replicates and their interactions with background management practices were used as random effects mixed effect analysis of covariance ancova was used to examine the interactive effect of ad and p 30 on yield to do this p 30 ad and their interaction were used as fixed effects and site year replication and their interactions with background management practices and the interaction of p 30 with site year were used as random effects levene s test indicated that variances were not substantially different among experiments allowing the use of a combined anova without need of a more complicated heterogenous variance model degrees of freedom were calculated using the kenward rodger approximation and alpha was set to 5 2 2 analysis of producer data data on yield and management practices were collected from 8015 fields sown with soybean in 10 states located within the nc us region iowa illinois indiana kansas michigan minnesota north dakota nebraska ohio and wisconsin over four 2014 2017 crop seasons fig 1 soybean producers provided data via returned surveys distributed by local crop consultants extension educators soybean grower boards and natural resources districts requested data included field location average field yield at 130 g kg 1 seed moisture content ad water regime rainfed or irrigated and other management practices detailed description of the survey database is provided elsewhere rattalino edreira et al 2017 mourtzinis et al 2018 in relation to drainage producers were requested to indicate type of drainage for each field by selecting among three options nd surface ad and subsurface ad subsurface ad systems in producer fields are dominant in the central and eastern part of the nc us region surface ad was reported only for fields in north dakota where shallow field ditches ca 25 cm deep are constructed by laser guided soil scrapers we focused our assessment on rainfed fields as the majority of soybean irrigated fields included in the database were located in the western fringe of the nc us region nebraska and kansas where ad is not common hence irrigated fields were excluded from the analysis as a first step to understand adoption of ad across the nc us region we mapped the frequency of ad fields across the nc us to do so producer fields were grouped by usda nass agricultural district we only considered agricultural districts with 15 surveyed fields in a subsequent step producer fields were grouped based on similarity of climate and soil fig 1 table 2 using the technology extrapolation domain ted spatial framework rattalino edreira et al 2018 briefly this framework delineates regions with similar climate and soil each ted corresponds to a specific combination of annual total growing degree days aridity index temperature seasonality and plant available water holding capacity grouping the fields into teds allowed us to account for climate soil background differences across the region only teds with 100 fields or very close to this threshold were considered for the analysis this number of fields can be considered appropriate to detect statistically significant yield differences between ad and nd fields mourtzinis et al 2017 following these criteria 15 teds were selected containing a total of 2805 surveyed soybean fields with an average of 187 fields per ted fig 1 table 2 the actual ted codes can be seen in table s1 these 15 teds included a total of 13 m ha sown with soybean representing ca 40 of us soybean harvested area usda nass 2017 out of the 15 teds surface ad was used only in 2 teds teds 1 2 whereas subsurface ad was used in 13 teds teds 3 15 for data analysis we focused on the dominant ad system within each ted as a result there was no ted included in the analysis that had both surface and sub surface ad fields all teds included at least 44 fields with ad or nd sowing date and twi ranges in producer fields were comparable to those in experiments tables 1 2 weather data for each surveyed field were obtained from the daymet dataset thornton et al 2016 and p 30 cumulative precipitation for each field was calculated fig 2 daymet precipitation data are reasonably accurate when means or totals are calculated over extended periods e g 30 d mourtzinis et al 2017 similarly twi was calculated for each field in the database following the method described in section 2 1 accounting for water table depth is difficult because of lack of data that allows to account for water table variation across fields and years rizzo et al 2018 however it seemed like twi indirectly accounted for water table depth as there was a correlation between twi and mean water table depth during april september derived from the usda nrcs ssurgo soil database pearson r 0 60 and 0 65 for subsurface and surface ad respectively across teds the effect of ad on yield was examined separately for subsurface and surface ad fields using mixed effect anova within each ted fields were categorized into three twi classes high medium low based on the terciles from the field twi distribution in each ted fig 2 since weather conditions and management practices varied across fields drainage was used as fixed effect while year ted and interactions with twi class ad and major management practices sowing date mg and use of foliar fungicide and or insecticide were considered random effects mixed effect ancova was used to examine the interactive effect of ad and p 30 on yield because ad is likely to influence sowing date in producer fields which in turn could affect soybean yield as reported elsewhere rattalino edreira et al 2017 mourtzinis et al 2018 we also investigated the interactive effect of p 30 and ad on sowing date we focused the analysis only on fields sown after maize and without crop residue removal during the non growing season as these are the dominant practices in nc us region for all analyses degrees of freedom were calculated using the kenward rodger approximation and alpha was set to 5 the statistical methods followed in our analysis are described in detail elsewhere littell et al 2006 all analyses met required assumptions e g normality homogeneity of variance and means were reported together with the standard error s e to provide a measure of uncertainty 3 results 3 1 soybean yield with artificial versus natural drainage based on experimental data across experimental site years average yield was 275 kg ha 1 s e 34 kg ha 1 higher in ad versus nd treatments p 0 001 representing an 8 yield increase in relation to average nd yield fig 3 there was still variation in the magnitude of the yield difference ranging from 114 to 775 kg ha 1 across site years in only 6 of the cases yield difference between ad and nd response was nil or negative there was no significant interaction between p 30 and ad across the experimental years p 0 89 similarly the magnitude of ad nd yield difference expressed either as an absolute value or as a fraction of nd yield was not correlated with the p 30 and twi at each site year as evaluated using pearson s correlation 0 03 r 0 25 p 0 09 3 2 effect of artificial drainage on producer soybean yield producer fields with subsurface ad were mostly distributed across the eastern and central portions of the nc us region fig 4 it was remarkable the high frequency of ad soybean fields in many agricultural districts located in these regions with 90 of fields with ad in some districts e g south central minnesota and north east illinois as indicated previously surface ad prevailed over subsurface ad in north dakota 31 and 3 respectively in contrast frequency of ad fields was nil or small in the western fringe i e nebraska kansas and western north dakota and most of wisconsin average producer yield was 157 kg ha 1 s e 31 kg ha 1 higher in subsurface ad versus nd fields p 0 001 representing a 4 increase relative to average nd yield fig 5 average yield difference between surface ad and nd fields in the teds located in the north west region was not significant 93 kg ha 1 s e 55 kg ha 1 p 0 092 similar to the findings derived from assessment of experimental data there was variation in the magnitude of the ad nd yield difference ranging from 112 to 395 kg ha 1 across ted years fig 5 table 3 in 10 of the cases yield difference between ad and nd response was nil or negative consistent with the results based on experimental data ted year specific ad nd yield differences expressed either as an absolute value or as a fraction of nd yield were not correlated with p 30 or twi 0 16 r 0 23 p 0 08 across teds ad fields tended to be located at positions of the landscape with high twi where the yield benefit of ad installation is expected to be larger table 3 similarly in season foliar fungicide and or insecticide application tended to be more common in ad versus nd fields in contrast average p 30 and sowing date were relatively similar between ad and nd fields across teds while the ad nd comparison based on experimental data had identical biophysical and management background at each site year fig 3 the analysis and interpretation of ad nd yield differences based on producer data is difficult as ad presence or absence in producer fields is coupled with changes in the biophysical environment and background management table 3 in connection to the previous point one could also speculate that ad installation could have led to changes in management practices that are not reflected in ted wide average differences between ad and nd fields in table 3 across teds on average subsurface and surface ad fields were sown ca 7 and 8 d earlier s e 1 6 and 2 3 d respectively than nd fields respectively fig 6 p 0 001 additionally there was an interactive effect between ad and p 30 with earlier sowing in ad versus nd fields only for p 30 values lower than 75 mm subsurface ad and 100 mm surface ad but no clear differences above these thresholds 4 discussion observed pattern of ad adoption across the us nc region followed the longitudinal gradient in precipitation increasing from west to east and the spatial pattern of water table depth reported by fan et al 2013 the analysis from replicated experiments revealed an average yield increase of 8 in subsurface ad versus nd fields analysis of producer survey data helped to confirm that the ad nd yield difference was also observed in producer fields however we found that average ad nd yield difference in producer fields 4 was relatively smaller to that observed in experiments 8 figs 3 and 5 a number of reasons can explain the observed discrepancy in magnitude of ad nd yield difference between experimental data and producer data first experiments evaluating the effect of ad on yield tended to be located at sites that were prone to excess water therefore a large yield benefit derived from ad adoption is expected for example experiments in teds 2 and 7 were located at sites with twi values that fall in the upper range of twi reported for producer fields located in those same two teds tables 1 and 2 in the case of the experiments in missouri where the highest ad nd yield difference was observed fig 3 soils have a distinct impermeable shallow claypan leading to presence of a shallow perched water table anderson et al 1990 blanco canqui et al 2002 additionally when compared to the rest of the locations in the dataset the narrow distance between tiles might have contributed to the greater effectiveness of ad to increase soybean yield in missouri acharya et al 2019 second in the case of the analysis of the producer data interpretation of the ad nd yield difference is confounded due to differences in the biophysical and management background in ad versus nd fields table 3 for example ad fields tended to be located in positions of the landscape where excess water in the soil is more likely to occur while nd fields are likely to be situated in environments where ad is not needed or is expected to have a smaller impact on yield to summarize the yield benefit derived from ad installation was likely over and underestimated when the analysis was based on experimental and producer data respectively another inherent limitation of the analysis based on experimental and producer data was not accounting for the expected shift in sowing date that likely occurs after ad adoption in a given field we estimated here that adoption of ad was associated with ca one week earlier sowing in environments prone to excess water fig 6 this finding agreed with results from a study in north eastern missouri where ad resulted in improved field workability and allowed up to a 17 d earlier sowing date nelson et al 2011 earlier sowing has been identified as an effective management strategy to increase soybean yield rowntree et al 2013 rattalino edreira et al 2017 mourtzinis et al 2018 2019 in our database yield penalty due to sowing delay was estimated to be on average 13 and 18 kg ha 1 d 1 for subsurface and surface ad respectively across teds which is consistent to the yield penalty reported in previous studies using the same database rattalino edreira et al 2017 mourtzinis et al 2019 hence one could estimate that ad adoption has led to an overall yield benefit ranging from 91 to 126 kg ha 1 as a result of one week earlier sowing the positive effect of ad adoption on yield via early sowing would have remained hidden if our analysis had focused only on experiments where ad nd side by side treatments were sown on the same date or comparisons of sowing date between ad and nd fields on a ted basis finally the magnitude of the yield benefit derived from ad may be influenced by the rainfall later during the crop season for example at a given twi nd fields may be penalized early in the season from too much water in the profile but they may also get some benefit later in the season due to additional stored water and or presence of shallow water tables especially in dry years rizzo et al 2018 productivity and environmental performance of ad soybean maize systems in the nc us region have received increasing attention and a call for sustainable intensification of ad cropping systems has been made recently castellano et al 2019 our study makes a first contribution here by showing that subsurface ad is an effective management practice to increase crop yields in environments of the nc us regions that have a high probability of excess water early in the season not surprisingly ad has been adopted in 71 of the soybean area located in the eastern and central nc us region including iowa illinois minnesota indiana ohio wisconsin and michigan fig 4 at farm level our findings can be used to determine the long term cumulative yield benefit and profit associated with ad installation in environments that are prone to excess water such an assessment would also require information about cost of ad installation expected yield increase in other crops in the rotation e g maize potential increase in land value and other benefits to the farm operation e g high yield stability across years and improved field workability early and throughout the season similarly results from our study can be used to determine the contribution of ad adoption to soybean yield gain over time for example soybean yield has increased during the past 20 years at an annual rate of ca 40 kg ha 1 y 1 in iowa illinois indiana and minnesota with these four states account for ca half of the us soybean production usda nass 2017 since ad adoption has increased at ca 1 per year in the four state cropland zulauf and brown 2019 and assuming an overall ad nd yield difference of 200 kg ha 1 based on experimental and producer data analyzed in our study one might infer that ad adoption has accounted for ca 5 of the overall soybean yield gain over the past two decades 5 conclusions we performed a combined analysis that includes both data from experimental plots as well as from producer fields to assess the yield benefit derived from ad compared with nd using data collected over recent years and across a wide range of environments analysis of experimental and producer survey data revealed a 4 8 benefit of ad in soybean yield in environments of the nc us region that are prone to excess water early in the season part of the yield benefit is likely driven by earlier sowing as a result of ad adoption our study also highlights the important contribution of ad adoption to the historical soybean yield gain in the us nc region declaration of competing interest no conflict of

extrapolation domains teds delineating regions with similar climate and soils to allow comparison of yields in ad versus nd fields in the case of subsurface drainage average yield in ad versus nd was 8 higher 275 kg ha 1 and 4 higher 157 kg ha 1 based on analysis of experimental and producer data respectively our analysis indicated that part of the ad nd yield difference in producer fields can be attributed to a shift towards earlier sowing after ad adoption findings from this study explain the wide adoption of ad across the central and eastern areas of the nc us region and provide a basis to determine the productivity and economic impact of ad installation at field and regional level keywords soybean glycine maxl drainage yield excess water 1 introduction excess water early in the crop season may result in extended periods with saturated soil conditions which affect soybean establishment and growth leading to reduced dry matter accumulation and yield oosterhuis et al 1990 linkemer et al 1998 nosetto et al 2009 hatfield et al 2014 bajgain et al 2015 besides the direct effect of excess water through anoxia stand losses higher disease pressure and reduction in n2 fixation bacanamwo and purcell 1999 saturated soil conditions may also delay sowing and plant emergence as it has been documented in previous studies sowing delay can lead to additional yield penalty rowntree et al 2013 rattalino edreira et al 2017 mourtzinis et al 2018 hence managing soil excess water early in the season is essential to avoid yield penalties across years the north central us nc us region includes ca 33 million ha of soybean sown annually usda nass 2017 in its natural state much of the fertile land in this region was either wetland or frequently too wet to allow profitable crop production beauchamp 1987 since the late 19th century artificial drainage ad started to be adopted to allow cultivation and field surveys conducted in the 1940s reported large maize yield increases due to ad adoption sutton 1943 uhland 1944 nowadays ca one third of the cropland in the entire nc us region and up to 70 90 in parts of the central and eastern areas of the region is artificially drained to reduce the risk associated with excess water early in the season usda nass 2017 rizzo et al 2018 castellano et al 2019 subsurface tile drainage is the most common ad method in the region except for the north western region north dakota where surface drainage prevails although tile drainage has recently started to be adopted in eastern north dakota wiersma et al 2010 the purpose of ad is to reduce excess water while improving workability and timely fieldwork in poorly drained soils lal and taylor 1970 zucker and brown 1998 the magnitude of yields derived from adoption of ad depends on timing frequency and duration of saturated soils as influenced by topography precipitation water table depth and their interactions wright and sands 2001 kladivko et al 2004 for example in wet years fields that receive water from upland positions in the landscape i e through surface run on are prone to excess water hence these fields are expected to benefit from ad adoption in contrast the impact is expected to be smaller or nil in dry years and or fields in upper positions of the landscape most studies that have examined the effect of ad to increase crop yield in the nc us region were conducted several decades ago schwab et al 1966 sipp et al 1986 in the case of soybean subsurface ad resulted in 0 4 mg ha 1 greater yield than nd 14 whereas the respective yield increase due to surface ad was 0 3 mg ha 1 11 sipp et al 1986 in the same study no difference was observed between surface and subsurface ad these experiments were conducted at research stations across a limited number of years which results in limited ability to extrapolate results to a wide region similarly management practices have changed drastically over time which would likely influence the yield response to ad e g earlier sowing date no till adoption finally the sites used in those previous studies have been selected based on their probability to favorably respond to ad installation which can bias the evaluation of ad in terms of crop yield response to summarize an assessment of the soybean yield benefits derived from ad adoption in producer fields using current management practices across a wide range of environments is missing we argue that an evaluation of interactions between ad weather and management practices using both experimental and producer data would provide a better understanding of the yield benefit derived from ad adoption in producer fields the objective of this study was to examine the effect of ad on soybean yield as influenced by pre sowing precipitation topography and management practices to do so we used experimental and producer field data collected in nc us region an area that accounts for a third of global soybean production and includes the largest area under soybean cultivation with ad in the world the analysis of experimental and producer survey data across a large number of sites and years allowed us to understand the effect of ad on soybean yield across a wide range of environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 analysis of experimental data we compiled yield and management data from replicated field experiments conducted in iowa missouri minnesota and north dakota during the past 20 years 2002 2019 fig 1 table 1 data from minnesota and north dakota were unpublished whereas subsets of the data from iowa and missouri have been published elsewhere nelson et al 2011 2012 2017 or are available via public data repositories abendroth et al 2017 the database included 47 site year experiments all experiments were rainfed that is they did not receive supplemental irrigation each trial included a side by side comparison of ad versus naturally drained nd treatments design of the drainage systems in these experiments was representative of those commonly installed in producer fields in the nc us region panuska 2015 helmers 2016 although the main focus of these experiments was comparison of ad versus nd most experiments included factorial arrangements to assess the interaction between ad with other factors such as cultivar maturity group mg seeding rate foliar fungicide use tillage and row spacing site year treatments with severe pest infestation or receiving poor management were excluded from the analysis while there was 47 site year experiments combination of site years and treatments resulted in a total of 139 paired observations to evaluate ad versus nd yield differences each paired observation had identical climate soil and management background each experiment reported sowing date mg seeding rate row spacing tillage method use of foliar fungicide and prior crop throughout this article soybean yields are reported at 130 g kg 1 seed moisture content daily precipitation data were retrieved from meteorological stations managed by the mesonet network http mrcc isws illinois edu gismaps mesonets htm located 30 km from the experimental sites and 30 d cumulative precipitation before sowing p 30 was calculated for each site year table 1 the p 30 was considered a reasonable indicator of excess water in the soil and workability of the field early in the season there was a wide range in p 30 values across site years which ranged from 15 to 253 mm table 1 the topography wetness index twi was calculated for each experiment twi has been used to characterize the potential for surface run off and run on in landscapes hence it can be used indirectly to assess the influence of field topography on crop productivity moore et al 1993 high values are associated with flat terrains whereas smaller values are associated with more uneven fields e g fields with slopes higher twi values are generally associated with higher chances that a field will receive surface runoff water and are typically classified as more productive soils twi was calculated using the rsaga wetness index package in r r development core team 2016 using the 30 m resolution national elevation dataset usda nrcs geospatial data gateway https datagateway nrcs usda gov mean twi for a given experiment was derived from the pixel twi distribution within each field field average twi values ranged from 9 8 11 8 across the four locations table 1 the design of the drainage system at each site was determined by researchers based on site specific soil type slope and water table depth while we are aware that drainage system design can influence the yield response to drainage acharya et al 2019 the experimental database did not allow us to evaluate that effect because there was no side by side comparison of different drainage system design in any of the sites across the region the effect of ad was examined using a mixed effect analysis of variance anova ad was used as fixed effect and site year replicates and their interactions with background management practices were used as random effects mixed effect analysis of covariance ancova was used to examine the interactive effect of ad and p 30 on yield to do this p 30 ad and their interaction were used as fixed effects and site year replication and their interactions with background management practices and the interaction of p 30 with site year were used as random effects levene s test indicated that variances were not substantially different among experiments allowing the use of a combined anova without need of a more complicated heterogenous variance model degrees of freedom were calculated using the kenward rodger approximation and alpha was set to 5 2 2 analysis of producer data data on yield and management practices were collected from 8015 fields sown with soybean in 10 states located within the nc us region iowa illinois indiana kansas michigan minnesota north dakota nebraska ohio and wisconsin over four 2014 2017 crop seasons fig 1 soybean producers provided data via returned surveys distributed by local crop consultants extension educators soybean grower boards and natural resources districts requested data included field location average field yield at 130 g kg 1 seed moisture content ad water regime rainfed or irrigated and other management practices detailed description of the survey database is provided elsewhere rattalino edreira et al 2017 mourtzinis et al 2018 in relation to drainage producers were requested to indicate type of drainage for each field by selecting among three options nd surface ad and subsurface ad subsurface ad systems in producer fields are dominant in the central and eastern part of the nc us region surface ad was reported only for fields in north dakota where shallow field ditches ca 25 cm deep are constructed by laser guided soil scrapers we focused our assessment on rainfed fields as the majority of soybean irrigated fields included in the database were located in the western fringe of the nc us region nebraska and kansas where ad is not common hence irrigated fields were excluded from the analysis as a first step to understand adoption of ad across the nc us region we mapped the frequency of ad fields across the nc us to do so producer fields were grouped by usda nass agricultural district we only considered agricultural districts with 15 surveyed fields in a subsequent step producer fields were grouped based on similarity of climate and soil fig 1 table 2 using the technology extrapolation domain ted spatial framework rattalino edreira et al 2018 briefly this framework delineates regions with similar climate and soil each ted corresponds to a specific combination of annual total growing degree days aridity index temperature seasonality and plant available water holding capacity grouping the fields into teds allowed us to account for climate soil background differences across the region only teds with 100 fields or very close to this threshold were considered for the analysis this number of fields can be considered appropriate to detect statistically significant yield differences between ad and nd fields mourtzinis et al 2017 following these criteria 15 teds were selected containing a total of 2805 surveyed soybean fields with an average of 187 fields per ted fig 1 table 2 the actual ted codes can be seen in table s1 these 15 teds included a total of 13 m ha sown with soybean representing ca 40 of us soybean harvested area usda nass 2017 out of the 15 teds surface ad was used only in 2 teds teds 1 2 whereas subsurface ad was used in 13 teds teds 3 15 for data analysis we focused on the dominant ad system within each ted as a result there was no ted included in the analysis that had both surface and sub surface ad fields all teds included at least 44 fields with ad or nd sowing date and twi ranges in producer fields were comparable to those in experiments tables 1 2 weather data for each surveyed field were obtained from the daymet dataset thornton et al 2016 and p 30 cumulative precipitation for each field was calculated fig 2 daymet precipitation data are reasonably accurate when means or totals are calculated over extended periods e g 30 d mourtzinis et al 2017 similarly twi was calculated for each field in the database following the method described in section 2 1 accounting for water table depth is difficult because of lack of data that allows to account for water table variation across fields and years rizzo et al 2018 however it seemed like twi indirectly accounted for water table depth as there was a correlation between twi and mean water table depth during april september derived from the usda nrcs ssurgo soil database pearson r 0 60 and 0 65 for subsurface and surface ad respectively across teds the effect of ad on yield was examined separately for subsurface and surface ad fields using mixed effect anova within each ted fields were categorized into three twi classes high medium low based on the terciles from the field twi distribution in each ted fig 2 since weather conditions and management practices varied across fields drainage was used as fixed effect while year ted and interactions with twi class ad and major management practices sowing date mg and use of foliar fungicide and or insecticide were considered random effects mixed effect ancova was used to examine the interactive effect of ad and p 30 on yield because ad is likely to influence sowing date in producer fields which in turn could affect soybean yield as reported elsewhere rattalino edreira et al 2017 mourtzinis et al 2018 we also investigated the interactive effect of p 30 and ad on sowing date we focused the analysis only on fields sown after maize and without crop residue removal during the non growing season as these are the dominant practices in nc us region for all analyses degrees of freedom were calculated using the kenward rodger approximation and alpha was set to 5 the statistical methods followed in our analysis are described in detail elsewhere littell et al 2006 all analyses met required assumptions e g normality homogeneity of variance and means were reported together with the standard error s e to provide a measure of uncertainty 3 results 3 1 soybean yield with artificial versus natural drainage based on experimental data across experimental site years average yield was 275 kg ha 1 s e 34 kg ha 1 higher in ad versus nd treatments p 0 001 representing an 8 yield increase in relation to average nd yield fig 3 there was still variation in the magnitude of the yield difference ranging from 114 to 775 kg ha 1 across site years in only 6 of the cases yield difference between ad and nd response was nil or negative there was no significant interaction between p 30 and ad across the experimental years p 0 89 similarly the magnitude of ad nd yield difference expressed either as an absolute value or as a fraction of nd yield was not correlated with the p 30 and twi at each site year as evaluated using pearson s correlation 0 03 r 0 25 p 0 09 3 2 effect of artificial drainage on producer soybean yield producer fields with subsurface ad were mostly distributed across the eastern and central portions of the nc us region fig 4 it was remarkable the high frequency of ad soybean fields in many agricultural districts located in these regions with 90 of fields with ad in some districts e g south central minnesota and north east illinois as indicated previously surface ad prevailed over subsurface ad in north dakota 31 and 3 respectively in contrast frequency of ad fields was nil or small in the western fringe i e nebraska kansas and western north dakota and most of wisconsin average producer yield was 157 kg ha 1 s e 31 kg ha 1 higher in subsurface ad versus nd fields p 0 001 representing a 4 increase relative to average nd yield fig 5 average yield difference between surface ad and nd fields in the teds located in the north west region was not significant 93 kg ha 1 s e 55 kg ha 1 p 0 092 similar to the findings derived from assessment of experimental data there was variation in the magnitude of the ad nd yield difference ranging from 112 to 395 kg ha 1 across ted years fig 5 table 3 in 10 of the cases yield difference between ad and nd response was nil or negative consistent with the results based on experimental data ted year specific ad nd yield differences expressed either as an absolute value or as a fraction of nd yield were not correlated with p 30 or twi 0 16 r 0 23 p 0 08 across teds ad fields tended to be located at positions of the landscape with high twi where the yield benefit of ad installation is expected to be larger table 3 similarly in season foliar fungicide and or insecticide application tended to be more common in ad versus nd fields in contrast average p 30 and sowing date were relatively similar between ad and nd fields across teds while the ad nd comparison based on experimental data had identical biophysical and management background at each site year fig 3 the analysis and interpretation of ad nd yield differences based on producer data is difficult as ad presence or absence in producer fields is coupled with changes in the biophysical environment and background management table 3 in connection to the previous point one could also speculate that ad installation could have led to changes in management practices that are not reflected in ted wide average differences between ad and nd fields in table 3 across teds on average subsurface and surface ad fields were sown ca 7 and 8 d earlier s e 1 6 and 2 3 d respectively than nd fields respectively fig 6 p 0 001 additionally there was an interactive effect between ad and p 30 with earlier sowing in ad versus nd fields only for p 30 values lower than 75 mm subsurface ad and 100 mm surface ad but no clear differences above these thresholds 4 discussion observed pattern of ad adoption across the us nc region followed the longitudinal gradient in precipitation increasing from west to east and the spatial pattern of water table depth reported by fan et al 2013 the analysis from replicated experiments revealed an average yield increase of 8 in subsurface ad versus nd fields analysis of producer survey data helped to confirm that the ad nd yield difference was also observed in producer fields however we found that average ad nd yield difference in producer fields 4 was relatively smaller to that observed in experiments 8 figs 3 and 5 a number of reasons can explain the observed discrepancy in magnitude of ad nd yield difference between experimental data and producer data first experiments evaluating the effect of ad on yield tended to be located at sites that were prone to excess water therefore a large yield benefit derived from ad adoption is expected for example experiments in teds 2 and 7 were located at sites with twi values that fall in the upper range of twi reported for producer fields located in those same two teds tables 1 and 2 in the case of the experiments in missouri where the highest ad nd yield difference was observed fig 3 soils have a distinct impermeable shallow claypan leading to presence of a shallow perched water table anderson et al 1990 blanco canqui et al 2002 additionally when compared to the rest of the locations in the dataset the narrow distance between tiles might have contributed to the greater effectiveness of ad to increase soybean yield in missouri acharya et al 2019 second in the case of the analysis of the producer data interpretation of the ad nd yield difference is confounded due to differences in the biophysical and management background in ad versus nd fields table 3 for example ad fields tended to be located in positions of the landscape where excess water in the soil is more likely to occur while nd fields are likely to be situated in environments where ad is not needed or is expected to have a smaller impact on yield to summarize the yield benefit derived from ad installation was likely over and underestimated when the analysis was based on experimental and producer data respectively another inherent limitation of the analysis based on experimental and producer data was not accounting for the expected shift in sowing date that likely occurs after ad adoption in a given field we estimated here that adoption of ad was associated with ca one week earlier sowing in environments prone to excess water fig 6 this finding agreed with results from a study in north eastern missouri where ad resulted in improved field workability and allowed up to a 17 d earlier sowing date nelson et al 2011 earlier sowing has been identified as an effective management strategy to increase soybean yield rowntree et al 2013 rattalino edreira et al 2017 mourtzinis et al 2018 2019 in our database yield penalty due to sowing delay was estimated to be on average 13 and 18 kg ha 1 d 1 for subsurface and surface ad respectively across teds which is consistent to the yield penalty reported in previous studies using the same database rattalino edreira et al 2017 mourtzinis et al 2019 hence one could estimate that ad adoption has led to an overall yield benefit ranging from 91 to 126 kg ha 1 as a result of one week earlier sowing the positive effect of ad adoption on yield via early sowing would have remained hidden if our analysis had focused only on experiments where ad nd side by side treatments were sown on the same date or comparisons of sowing date between ad and nd fields on a ted basis finally the magnitude of the yield benefit derived from ad may be influenced by the rainfall later during the crop season for example at a given twi nd fields may be penalized early in the season from too much water in the profile but they may also get some benefit later in the season due to additional stored water and or presence of shallow water tables especially in dry years rizzo et al 2018 productivity and environmental performance of ad soybean maize systems in the nc us region have received increasing attention and a call for sustainable intensification of ad cropping systems has been made recently castellano et al 2019 our study makes a first contribution here by showing that subsurface ad is an effective management practice to increase crop yields in environments of the nc us regions that have a high probability of excess water early in the season not surprisingly ad has been adopted in 71 of the soybean area located in the eastern and central nc us region including iowa illinois minnesota indiana ohio wisconsin and michigan fig 4 at farm level our findings can be used to determine the long term cumulative yield benefit and profit associated with ad installation in environments that are prone to excess water such an assessment would also require information about cost of ad installation expected yield increase in other crops in the rotation e g maize potential increase in land value and other benefits to the farm operation e g high yield stability across years and improved field workability early and throughout the season similarly results from our study can be used to determine the contribution of ad adoption to soybean yield gain over time for example soybean yield has increased during the past 20 years at an annual rate of ca 40 kg ha 1 y 1 in iowa illinois indiana and minnesota with these four states account for ca half of the us soybean production usda nass 2017 since ad adoption has increased at ca 1 per year in the four state cropland zulauf and brown 2019 and assuming an overall ad nd yield difference of 200 kg ha 1 based on experimental and producer data analyzed in our study one might infer that ad adoption has accounted for ca 5 of the overall soybean yield gain over the past two decades 5 conclusions we performed a combined analysis that includes both data from experimental plots as well as from producer fields to assess the yield benefit derived from ad compared with nd using data collected over recent years and across a wide range of environments analysis of experimental and producer survey data revealed a 4 8 benefit of ad in soybean yield in environments of the nc us region that are prone to excess water early in the season part of the yield benefit is likely driven by earlier sowing as a result of ad adoption our study also highlights the important contribution of ad adoption to the historical soybean yield gain in the us nc region declaration of competing interest no conflict of
