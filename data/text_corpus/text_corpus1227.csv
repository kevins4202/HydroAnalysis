6135,lake water storage is an important factor in analyses of lake water balance however it is difficult to calculate the water storage of lakes on the tibetan plateau due to the lack of bathymetric data lake water storage and changes in chibuzhang co cc and duoersuodong co dc which are located in an endorheic system and have been connected since 2006 were estimated based on in situ bathymetric data satellite altimetry data and landsat images of the central tibetan plateau in 2016 the maximum depth and water storage of dc were 68 7 m and 12 2 1 72 km3 respectively with an area of 490 2 km2 and those of cc were 116 3 m and 16 2 2 27 km3 respectively with an area of 575 4 km2 the total lake water storage in dc and cc increased by 24 5 2 4 km3 and 14 1 2 km3 from 2003 to 2014 respectively based on satellite altimetry data and landsat images using an empirical equation the relationship between lake changes and meteorological factors indicated that both increased glacial meltwater and increased precipitation were important drivers of each lake s expansion and that a small increase in evaporation 2 5 mm y had little negative impact on lake expansion 0 41 m y heterogeneous changes in the two lakes from 1993 to 2005 were mainly due to water from cc supplying dc through a channel and the lake level of dc was always lower than that of cc until 2006 indicating that the geological conditions around both lakes were also an important factor in the lake changes the assumption was that all glacial meltwater from the puruogangri and geladandong glaciers was supplied to the two lakes through runoff with minimal evaporation and glacial meltwater made an approximately 19 3 4 5 contribution to the lake expansions 0 4 km3 y of dc and cc from 2003 to 2014 based on the results of the glacier mass balance keywords bathymetric data water storage lake expansion glacial meltwater 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp has been described as the third pole and the asian water tower and many of the major asian rivers that originate on the tp are maintained by surface runoff immerzeel et al 2010 e g the yellow river yangtze river and brahmaputra river which together supply water to nourish hundreds of millions of people there many glaciers and lakes across the tp which are sensitive to climate change and have considerable influence on the regional hydrological cycle through land breeze circulation and changes in regional precipitation samuelsson and tjernström 2001 zhao et al 2012 the climate of the tp has experienced great changes in recent decades and the air temperature 0 036 c y and lake surface temperature 0 03 c y showed rising trends from 2001 to 2012 according to the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land surface temperature data zhang et al 2014b nearly 90 of the meteorological stations on the tp showed increased annual precipitation from 1961 to 2001 xu et al 2008 most glaciers on the tp have experienced significant shrinkage but most lakes on the tp have experienced a rapid expansion since 1994 except for several lakes in the southern tp since 2000 lei et al 2014 li et al 2014b phan et al 2012 wang et al 2013 song et al 2013 2014a b yao et al 2012 zhang et al 2011b 2014a 2017 lake expansion floods roads and meadows therefore lake expansion has a serious influence on the regional environment and animal husbandry and many studies have analyzed the causes of lake changes most previous studies have mainly focused on lake areas wan et al 2014 zhang et al 2014a 2015 and lake levels phan et al 2012 song et al 2014a zhang et al 2011b whereas only a few studies have focused on changes in lake water storage qiao et al 2019 qiao and zhu 2017 song et al 2014a zhang et al 2011b 2017 lake water storage change is a better indicator of responses to climate change than lake area change because the topographic conditions around lakes are different qiao et al 2017 for example a lake with steep slopes may experience less area change than a lake in a gently sloping basin even though the former may receive more inflowing water than the latter lake water storage change can be estimated by combining satellite radar altimetry data and landsat images the ice cloud and land elevation satellite icesat with a 70 m footprint has been widely used to study lake level and water storage changes in large lakes li et al 2014b phan et al 2012 song et al 2013 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2011b from 2003 to 2009 the cryosat 2 mission was launched in april 2010 the altimetry data from the satellite provided earth surface measurements with a footprint of approximately 290 m which were also used to analyze lake levels and water storage changes in large lakes with high precision jiang et al 2017 kleinherenbrink et al 2015 lee et al 2016 song et al 2015a b lake water storage and underwater topography are also important information in lake research the variation in lake heat storage is an important component used for estimating evaporation in deep lakes where the lake heat storage is dependent upon absolute water storage mcmahon et al 2013 the underwater topography of large lakes is very helpful for further studies of the paleoenvironment and water energy conversions e g how to select a suitable site for sediment drilling wang et al 2017 xu et al 2019 and water temperature observations at different depths huang et al 2017 lazhu et al 2015 there is little research on lake water storage and underwater topography due to the lack of bathymetric data and other available data if the bathymetric data of the lake are known the underwater topography and water storage can be calculated using a spatial interpolation method however most lakes on the tp are distributed across remote regions that are inaccessible and only a few lakes have been surveyed using bathymetric equipment e g nam co zhang et al 2011a four lakes on the northwestern tp qiao et al 2017 and paiku co on the southern tp lei et al 2018 the cause of tp lake changes is still debated and some previous studies considered that increased precipitation may be the main cause of lake expansion based on an analysis of the relationship between the annual precipitation change trend and annual lake area and lake level changes and by quantifying the contribution of each factor to lake change using a hydrological model lei et al 2013 song et al 2014b zhou et al 2015 by analyzing the annual change in lake surface evaporation researchers found that decreasing lake evaporation contributed approximately 4 to the rapid lake expansion of nam co ma et al 2016 li et al 2014b speculated that the main cause of tp lake expansion was permafrost degradation because most lake expansion had occurred in the area of the tp where considerable permafrost was distributed and glaciers experienced less retreats however based on the measurement data and remote sensing images most glaciers have experienced significant shrinkage on the tp yao et al 2012 increased glacial meltwater may have an important contribution to lake expansion li et al 2014a meng et al 2011 zhang et al 2011b 2015 zhu et al 2010 according to a comparison of the glacier elevation differences in the five pairs of tandem cossc datasets between 2013 and 2014 and srtm in 2000 the decadal glacier mass balance in the western nyainqentanglha mountains was calculated for the 2000 to 2014 period and the results indicated that the contribution of glacial meltwater to the lake expansion of nam co was likely 10 5 9 li and lin 2017 a comparison of the glacier surface elevation difference between spot 6 7 stereo imagery and srtm revealed that glacial meltwater contributed 9 9 and 11 1 to the lake expansions of lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake respectively on the central tp zhou et al 2019 the results of zhu et al 2010 indicated that although precipitation played a dominant role in maintaining the water balance increased glacial meltwater made a 50 6 contribution to the lake expansion of nam co based on a quantification of the proportions of different factors glacial meltwater was considered to have made an equivalent contribution to lake expansion with precipitation evaporation according to a comparison of the difference between the change in water storage of glacier fed and non glacier fed lakes in the tanggula mountains song and sheng 2016 northwestern tp qiao and zhu 2017 and inner tp qiao and zhu 2019 due to the lack of reliable measurement data on mass balance and meteorological data quantification of the contribution of glacial meltwater to lake expansion has mainly concentrated on several large lakes and many more lakes must be included in future studies in this paper the lake depth distributions of cc and dc which are located in an endorheic system on the central tp were surveyed in 2016 using a lowrance hds5 instrument the bathymetric data were used to establish the underwater topography and estimate lake water storage we estimated lake water storage changes over a long time scale from 2003 to 2014 by combining altimetry data icesat and cryosat 2 and landsat images the purposes of this study were as follows 1 to analyze the characteristics of the underwater topography and estimate water storage 2 to estimate changes in water storage from 2003 to 2014 3 to analyze the possible linkage between lake changes and climatic factors and 4 to quantify the contribution of glacial meltwater to lake expansion 2 study area the study region is located in the transitional zone between the monsoon dominated south and the dry continental westerly dominated north thompson et al 2006 the annual average temperature of this region is approximately 4 c based on data from the regional meteorological station and the annual precipitation is less than 500 mm with 90 of the precipitation occurring from may to september zhou et al 2014 puruogangri is one of the largest ice fields outside of the arctic and antarctic with a glacier area of approximately 420 km2 and an ice volume of approximately 52 km3 yi et al 2002 the ice core records from the puruogangri glaciers suggested that abrupt warming began in the early 20th century and continued until 2000 and this region was influenced more by continental climatic processes than by the monsoon because the low high δ18o was similar to that in the dunde ice core to the north but opposite to that in the dasuopu ice core in the himalayas thompson et al 2006 strengthened westerlies would increase the precipitation in this region yao et al 2012 understanding the changes in lake levels and water storage in lakes fed by this ice cap would help to complement information provided by the paleoclimate records most tp lakes are tectonic lakes and the total watershed of the study region is located in a large discontinuous mountain basin controlled by the bangong nujiang tectonic belt as shown in fig 1 cc 90 37 e 33 47 n and dc 89 90 e 33 43 n are twin lakes that are connected by a channel in the initial period pre 2006 only dc was endorheic while water from cc flowed into dc through a channel during the later period both lakes merged and formed one single endorheic system jiang et al 2017 the levels of the two lakes increased quickly over the last decade and increased glacial meltwater may have made similar contribution to lake expansion as that of precipitation evaporation song and sheng 2016 cc receives a glacial meltwater supply from the geladandong glaciers via three large rivers which are located on the eastern side of this lake approximately 60 km from cc fig 1 an upstream lake is located in the northeastern part of cc dc also receives a glacial meltwater supply from the puruogangri glaciers through a large river fig 1 which is located to the west of this lake approximately 50 km from dc glacier surface elevation changes have been reported based on different methods specially the glacier surface elevation decreased by 6 2 m from 1974 to 2000 lei et al 2012 and by 0 046 0 082 m w e a 1 from 2000 to 2011 zhang et al 2018 and the thinning rate was 0 317 0 027 m y from 2012 to 2016 liu et al 2016 most glaciers in the tangguala mountains have been retreating since the 1960s tseng et al 2016 the geladandong glacier area decreased by 66 68 km2 7 37 of the total glacier area from 1992 to 2009 zhou et al 2014 and the glacier surface elevation thinning rate was 0 22 0 12 m y from 1973 to 2000 zhou et al 2018 based on icesat laser altimetry measurements and 0 243 0 066 m w e a 1 from 2000 2016 zhang et al 2018 based on modis albedo products 3 methods 3 1 multi temporal landsat images for lake area extraction landsat multispectral scanner thematic mapper tm enhanced thematic mapper plus etm operational land image images were used to extract the lake areas because no images were available for the years 1989 1991 1995 1997 and 1999 we only calculated the lake area in 1976 1988 1990 1992 1993 1994 1996 and 1998 and from 2000 to 2016 these images were downloaded from the u s geological survey http glovis usgs gov the lake level of most lakes on the tp showed large increases during the warm seasons march october and declines or minor fluctuations during the cold seasons november february song et al 2014a to compare the inter annual changes and reduce the seasonal variation influence only the images obtained between september and november were selected because the lake levels were at their highest during these months allowing us to compare the largest area change of the lakes over a given year in recent decades the highest quality images with the least amount of clouds and snow were prioritized and detailed information on the images use is provided in table 1 the normalized difference water index ndwi method was used to extract the lake areas mcfeeters 1996 the detailed process of this method is as follows 1 the image was processed by radiometric correction to eliminate or correct image distortion caused by radiation error process 2 the band ratio method was used with the green band and near infrared nir band to calculate the pixel value ratio in different bands of the same image with the equation ndwi green nir green nir 3 the color slice range of 0 1 was chosen to extract the water body boundary as a shapefile and 4 the error boundary was modified by manual interpretation 3 2 bathymetric data for estimating water storage bathymetric data from the lake were surveyed in situ in october 2016 a lowrance hds5 which has a vertical accuracy of 0 01 m was used to survey the lake depth and bathymetric data were recorded every second the measured route is shown in fig 2 a total of 0 68 million points were measured which covered the main region of the two lakes except for three small areas which were located in the western parts of cc and dc and the southeastern part of cc fig 2 all bathymetric data with latitude longitude and depth used for establishing the underwater topography of two lakes are provided in appendix these data were used to estimate lake water storage which essentially represented the actual lake water storage we combined the bathymetric data and lake shoreline data to establish the underwater topography and we assigned the depth value of the lake shoreline as 0 to reduce interpolation bias the topo to raster tool is an interpolation method specifically designed for the creation of a hydrologically correct digital elevation model dem and an iterative finite difference interpolation technique was used hutchinson 1988 1989 using spatial analyst tools topo to raster in arcgis 9 3 to establish the underwater topography with grid units of 56 m 56 m water storage was estimated based on a given lake depth using the area and volume tool of 3d analyst in arcgis 3 3 altimetry data to calculate lake level change the altimetry data from icesat and cryosat 2 have been widely used to monitor lake level changes on the tp jiang et al 2017 phan et al 2012 song et al 2014a zhang et al 2011b the geoscience laser altimeter system glas onboard icesat has provided global altimetry data for approximately 20 one month campaigns since january 2003 song et al 2013 the national snow and ice data center nsidc archived all the original datasets and distributed icesat s level 2 global land surface altimetry data product gla14 we used the nsidc glas altimetry elevation extractor tool ngat to extract the time series elevation with latitude longitude and geoid information from the glas14 altimetry products the narrow primary peak threshold nppt retracker jain et al 2015 was applied to the cryosat 2 data which had previously been proven to provide valid results for inland water application nielsen et al 2015 villadsen et al 2016 1 r r wd r r r gc where rwd is the window delay rr is the retracker correction and rgc are the geophysical corrections including the ionosphere wet and dry troposphere solid earth tide ocean loading tide and pole tide the surface elevation h with respect to the earth gravitational model of 2008 geoid egm2008 was obtained using the following equation 2 h h r n where h is the satellite altitude and n is the geoid height with respect to the ellipsoid icesat and data cryosat 2 covered the periods from 2003 to 2009 and 2010 to 2015 respectively and the height of the icesat data was converted from egm1996 to egm2008 which was consistent with the cryosat 2 data we calculated the average lake level on the same day as the lake level and we calculated the standard deviation of these data on the same day to determine the accuracy and bias of the average lake level we used these data to reconstruct lake level changes from 2003 to 2014 3 4 estimation of lake water storage change there are several methods used to estimate lake water storage change such as using an empirical equation based on the relationship between lake area and lake level qiao et al 2017 song et al 2013 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 or to estimate based on underwater topography qiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2011a because three small areas of the two lakes were not measured using bathymetric data and the lake area change in these two lakes was mainly concentrated in these areas western dc and southeastern cc the lake water storage change could not be accurately estimated based on the underwater topography and time series change in the lake area as reported by qiao et al 2017 and zhang et al 2011a in this study we obtained the lake level change from the icesat and cryosat 2 altimetry data and the lake area change from multi temporal landsat images an empirical equation was used to estimate water storage changes based on changes in lake area and level 3 δ v 1 3 s 1 s 1 s 2 s 2 δ h s1 and s2 represent the lake areas for two periods h represents the lake level change during the two periods and v represents the water storage change during the two periods 3 5 the meteorological data used to analyze the causes of lake variations the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd covering 1979 2013 was developed by the institute of tibetan plateau research chinese academy of sciences he and yang 2011 these datasets were assimilated by combining the meteorological data from 740 stations of the china meteorological administration cma princeton meteorological forcing data sheffield et al 2006 and the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b42 precipitation products huffman et al 2007 these datasets included near surface temperature precipitation pressure wind speed and specific humidity with temporal and spatial resolutions of 3 h and 0 1 respectively the dataset was used to analyze the annual precipitation and annual average temperature change trend from 1979 to 2013 the penman equation penman 1948 has been widely and successfully used for estimating open water evaporation mcmahon et al 2013 because actual evaporation information is difficult to acquire on the tp we used the penman equation to estimate the potential evaporation ep of the lake surface water based on data from 56 meteorological stations on the tp and to estimate their spatial distributions using the kriging interpolation method in arcgis the daily maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity sunshine duration and wind velocity data at each meteorological station were used to calculate ep from 1976 to 2013 4 ep δ δ γ rn λ γ δ γ 6430 1 0 536 u 2 d λ where rn is the daily net radiation mj m 2 day 1 is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa c γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c d is the vapor

cover of hoh xil lake occurred in the middle of october to early december and complete melting occurred from early may to the middle of june yao et al 2015 sublimation from the lake surface ice could be considered negligible due to the low temperature in this region during winter ma et al 2016 we assume that the evaporation from december to april is 0 and that evaporation during the other months represents the annual ep 4 results 4 1 the characteristics of the underwater topography and lake water storage as shown in fig 2 22 transects were measured which covered the main region of the two lakes there were 445 549 and 240 472 measurement points in cc and dc respectively and the maximum depths and lake area were 116 3 m and 575 4 km2 and 68 7 m and 490 2 km2 respectively lake underwater topography and depth isobaths were reconstructed based on the bathymetric data the maximum depth of cc was located in the southern area of the lake and the topography was very steep the maximum depth of dc was located in the central part of the lake a large area of this region was greater than 60 m deep and the topography was gentle the profile graph tools on the 3d analyst interactive toolbar were used to derive a graphic representation in one profile using this tool six profiles of the two lakes were derived as shown in fig 2 six profiles were derived based on the underwater topography the maximum depth profiles were profiles a and f which were located in cc and the shallowest was profile d which was located in the western cc as shown in profiles a e and f the underwater topography of cc was very steep especially in the southern part of this lake which showed intensive isobaths the topography of dc was undulating based on profiles b and c and the average depth was shallower than that of cc a small lake connects the two large lakes which is located in the middle of dc and cc the topography is gentle in this lake and the maximum depth of this lake is less than 40 m lake water storage can be estimated based on the underwater topography because the scope of the bathymetric data did not cover both lakes entirely with data missing for the western part of dc and the southeastern and northwestern parts of cc the estimated lake water storage should be less than that of the actual water storage however the bathymetric data covered the main region of the two lakes and we are confident that the estimation of lake water storage satisfactorily represents the actual water storage based on the underwater topography the lake water storage of dc was at least 12 2 1 72 km3 and the average depth of this lake was 31 7 m in 2016 we calculated the lake water storage in cc including that of the small lake connecting the two large lakes the water storage of the small lake was at least 1 85 0 26 km3 and the average depth of this lake was 14 2 m in 2016 the water storage of the main lake in cc was at least 14 3 2 01 km3 and the average depth of this lake was 37 7 m in 2016 although the maximum depth of cc was approximately twice that of dc the average depths of the two lakes were nearly the same 4 2 changes in lake area and level as shown in fig 3 the lake area of cc increased slightly from 1976 to 1988 whereas that of dc experienced a decreasing trend during this period both lakes remained stable during 1988 1993 cc shrank during 1993 1996 and then remained stable during 1996 2004 and the lake area began to increase after 2005 5 3 km2 y the lake area of dc underwent a rapid increase from 1996 to 2005 subsequently the increased rate of the lake area 9 9 km2 y from 2006 to 2016 was lower than the rate during 1996 2005 2 8 km2 y the two lakes showed different types of changes in the different periods but both lakes exhibited a rapidly increased rate after 2005 as shown in fig 4 a the standard deviation of the cc lake level was much higher than that of dc but the lake level of cc was consistent with that of dc after 2010 the lake levels of cc and dc were not consistent before 2006 and the lake level of cc was approximately 1 m higher than that of dc in 2004 according to the srtm dem which acquired dem data for over 80 of the globe during an 11 day mission in february 2000 the lake level of cc was approximately 6 m higher than that of dc these results indicated that even though the two lakes were connected by a channel the amount of water inflow to dc from cc was limited because the channel was narrow before 2006 the increased rate of the dc lake area was much faster during 1996 2005 than that during 2006 2016 but cc exhibited a stable state during 1996 2005 the main cause was that the difference in lake levels was narrowing with the supply from cc to dc until the lake levels of both lakes were consistent in 2006 however as the lake level continued to increase once the level in each lake increased to a particular threshold the levels of the two lakes were consistent and maintained the same rates thereafter the average increased rate of the lake was 0 41 m y from 2006 to 2014 and the increased rate during 2011 2014 0 53 m y was faster than that during 2006 2011 0 34 m y 4 3 lake water storage change as shown in fig 4b the lake area of cc decreased by 0 5 km2 from 2003 to 2004 and the lake level and water storage decreased by 0 3 m and 0 14 km3 respectively during this period the lake area of dc increased by 9 5 km2 and the lake level and water storage increased by 0 38 m and 0 17 km3 respectively from 2003 to 2004 the lake water storage began to increase after 2004 and the increased rate of dc 0 22 km3 y was higher than that of cc 0 18 km3 y from 2003 to 2014 the increased water storage of dc and cc was 2 4 km3 and 2 km3 respectively over the period 2003 2014 the greatest increase in water storage of cc was 0 38 km3 during 2011 2012 and 0 4 km3 during 2012 2013 and the increase was 0 33 km3 and 0 35 km3 in dc during the same periods respectively water storage in dc and cc had increased by 24 5 and 14 1 since 2003 respectively 4 4 inter annual variations in meteorological factors as shown in fig 5 we analyzed only the change trends in the annual precipitation annual average temperature and annual evaporation from 1976 to 2013 the average precipitation was 309 5 mm y ranging from 190 9 mm 1994 to 529 9 mm 2005 during 1979 2013 it also showed a significant variation with an average of 281 8 mm y ranging from 190 9 mm 1994 to 413 2 mm 1996 during 1979 2000 followed by a slight increased trend with significant variation the average annual precipitation was 356 4 mm y ranging from 221 8 2006 to 529 9 mm 2005 during 2001 2013 fig 5a the linear regression method with spss software was used to calculate the rates of increase or decrease the annual average temperature exhibited a significantly increased trend with a rate of 0 026 c y r2 0 39 p less than 0 05 and the annual average temperature was 5 76 c during 1979 2013 r2 0 67 the lowest annual average temperature occurred in 1997 with an annual average temperature of 7 8 c fig 5b the annual evaporation showed significant variation with an increased trend 2 5 mm y r2 0 67 p less than 0 01 ranging from 1194 1 mm 1979 to 1354 1 mm 1999 during 1976 2013 and the average evaporation was 1284 7 mm y during this period fig 5c the change trends in the monthly precipitation and average monthly temperature are shown in fig 6 the lowest temperatures mainly occurred in november december january and february the highest temperatures mainly occurred in june july and august and the average temperature in august was approximately 5 c with a significantly increased trend from 1979 to 2013 fig 6a most of the precipitation mainly occurred in june july august and september with significant variations fig 6b the precipitation showed a decreasing trend from 1979 to 1985 and then increased with significant variations until 2013 the precipitation levels in 2005 and 2007 were lower than those in other years 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties in water storage estimation based on bathymetric data using bathymetric and altimetry data is an effective method to estimate lake water storage change qiao et al 2017 song et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 however there are certain uncertainties in lake water storage estimation based on underwater topography because bathymetric data only cover part of the lake estimating lake water storage change using an empirical equation based on altimetry data and landsat images provides much higher precision than that achieved with bathymetric data we considered the results of water storage change from altimetry data as a truth value to compare the accuracy of bathymetric data bathymetric data of bangdag co from qiao et al 2017 covered the main area of the lake which could be used to estimate changes in water storage by combining landsat images we also estimated the water storage change in bangdag co based on altimetry data icesat and cryosat 2 and landsat images from 2004 to 2014 except for 2006 2009 and 2013 missing data and compared the accuracy of the two results the error was much larger when water storage underwent a small change e g 2004 2005 and 2010 2011 and the error was lower when water storage underwent a large change e g 2004 2008 and 2011 2014 the error in the estimated change in lake water storage based on bathymetric data was 12 8 with respect to the results from altimetry data therefore we considered that the error of lake water storage estimation was approximately 12 8 lake water storage change can also be estimated by combining the underwater topography from bathymetric data and data on changes in lake water level and comparing these results with the results from altimetry data and landsat images the assumption is that the lake level from 2014 to 2016 was consistent because the lake area changed little during this period the results from altimetry data suggested a larger change compared with the results derived from bathymetric data table 2 with an error of 23 2 which was larger than the error for the results of bangdag co 12 8 the reason for this difference could be that bathymetric data were not available for part of the area with increased water storage e g the western part of dc and the southeastern part of cc 5 2 geological conditions because the terrain of the tp is complex the topography around the lakes has an important influence on lake changes upstream lakes receive glacial meltwater directly from glaciers that supply downstream lakes and the area and level of upstream lakes remain stable whereas downstream lakes continue to expand quickly qiao and zhu 2017 song and sheng 2016 water seepage may be an important cause of lake change and nam co may have been affected by seepage because of a lake water imbalance based on the observed water surface evaporation and river runoff data zhou et al 2013 phan et al 2013 analyzed the relationship between tp lakes and glacial runoff based on geometric characteristics indicated that tp lakes depend more or less on glacial meltwater in which there were glaciers in these watersheds as shown in fig 7 the two lakes were connected in 1973 however the channel was narrow and the lake water supply from the cc was limited because a dam intercepted the water from the cc it was difficult for the two lakes to reach the same level in a short time and both lakes remained stable during 1988 1993 however the lake area of dc began to increase quickly after 1993 and the channel connecting the dam began to widen with the rising lake level however cc remained in a stable state suggesting that most of the increased water storage in cc was supplied to dc the lake level of the two lakes was consistent in 2006 and the water channel was sufficiently wide for water to flow from cc to dc until the lake levels equalized suggesting that the geological conditions around the lake are an important factor in lake changes 5 3 climate factors changes in precipitation and evaporation have direct impacts on lake changes and glacial meltwater increases with rising temperatures as shown in fig 6b even though the precipitation had a fluctuating increased trend the lake area maintained a steady rate of expansion after 1996 suggesting that the precipitation was not the only cause of lake expansion the rate of rising temperature was faster during 2000 2006 than that during any other periods and the average temperature in summer also rose during 1979 2013 which may have increased the flow of glacial meltwater to the lakes the geladandong and puruogangri glaciers have experienced significant shrinkage in recent years guo et al 2015 liu et al 2016 neckel et al 2014 wei et al 2014 increased evaporation 2 5 mm y had little impact on the rising lake level 0 41 m y during 2006 2015 both increased glacial meltwater and precipitation had been considered the main causes of lake expansion however due to the lack of observational data and other reliable satellite data it was difficult to quantify the contribution of the different factors to lake expansion and analyze the main cause of lake changes 5 4 glacial meltwater most glaciers on the tp have experienced significant retreat in recent years yao et al 2012 and increased glacial meltwater can bring much more glacial water to the lakes however the contribution of glacial meltwater to lake expansion is difficult to quantify due to a lack of measurement data and reliable satellite data altimetry data e g icesat or cryosat 2 were used to calculate glacier surface elevation change ke et al 2015 neckel et al 2014 but the altimetry data only covered part of the glacier surface on the tp which may not represent change in the glacier surface elevation of the glaciers multi temporal dems have been widely used to research changes in glacier surface elevation by comparing the differences over times and these measurements can cover the entire glacier surface brun et al 2017 li and lin 2017 liu et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 for example the terrasar tsx add on for the digital elevation measurement tandem x mission was launched in 2010 by the german aerospace center and the primary objective of this mission was to generate a global high accuracy and homogeneous dem following the high standard of accuracy for high resolution terrain information tandem x has been widely used to calculate glacier elevation change with high accuracy li and lin 2017 liu et al 2016 and the multi temporal aster is also used to generate new dems and calculate glacier surface elevation changes by comparing the difference in dems brun et al 2017 rivera et al 2005 table 3 lists the result of glacier mass balances for the puruogangri and geladandong region from different studies which vary in spatial and temporal coverage as well as used techniques a comparison of these studies indicates a periodic shift in glacier thinning rates over the puruogangri balanced or slightly negative glacier mass balance 0 044 0 015 m w e a 1 for the period of 2000 2012 huintjes et al 2015 neckel et al 2013 and more negative mass balances 0 269 0 025 m w e a 1 for the period of 2012 2016 liu et al 2016 the mean mass balance for the two periods was consistent with that in the study by zhang et al 2018 which was 0 046 0 082 m w e a 1 and 0 294 0 134 m w e a 1 respectively we thus used the result of 2000 2016 0 113 0 068 m w e a 1 from zhang et al 2018 for the mean glacier mass balance over the puruogangri similar to the case for puruogangri the results of the study by zhang et al 2018 for the two periods in geladandong glaciers were also consistent with previous results chao et al 2017 liu 2016 liu et al 2017 for example the glacier mass balance of geladandong was 0 128 0 049 m w e a 1 during 2000 2012 based on the study by liu 2016 and 0 134 0 056 m w e a 1 during 2003 2009 based on the study by chao et al 2017 which was consistent with the results of in zhang et al 2018 namely 0 143 0 008 m w e a 1 furthermore the lacier mass balance for the eastern part of the geladandong glaciers was 0 155 0 048 m w e a 1 during 2000 2012 based on the study by liu 2016 which was also consistent with the result in the study by zhang et al 2018 namely 0 146 0 008 m w e a 1 we thus used the 2000 2016 result 0 243 0 066 m w e a 1 from zhang et al 2018 for the mean glacier mass balance over the geladandong glaciers in our study region are located in the western puruogangri and eastern geladandong and the glacier areas were 91 55 km2 and 74 59 km2 in 2007 respectively according to the second chinese glacier inventory guo et al 2015 which constituted 21 8 and 32 5 of the glaciers area found by zhang et al 2018 respectively we used the mean glacier mass balance results from zhang et al 2018 to estimate glacial meltwater in this study the two lakes receive glacial meltwater from the eastern glaciers of puruogangri and western glaciers of geladandong and the amount of glacial meltwater from the two glaciers was approximately 0 01 0 006 km3 y and 0 067 0 018 km3 y from 2000 to 2016 respectively based on glacier area and mass balance data the assumption was that all glacial meltwater supplied to the two lakes was through runoff with minimal evaporation which contributed approximately 19 3 4 5 of the total lake expansion of dc and cc 0 4 km3 y from 2003 to 2014 6 conclusion in this study we used bathymetric data to acquire underwater topography data using a spatial interpolation method for two lakes dc and cc on the central tp the maximum depth and water storage of the two lakes were 68 7 m and 12 2 1 72 km3 respectively with an area of 490 2 km2 for dc and 116 3 m and 16 2 2 27 km3 respectively with an area of 575 4 km2 for cc in 2016 the increased water storage in dc and cc was 2 4 km3 and 2 km3 respectively from 2003 to 2014 based on satellite altimetry data icesat and cryosat 2 and landsat images the relationship between lake change and meteorological factors indicated that increased glacial meltwater and increased precipitation were important causes for lake expansion whereas increased evaporation 2 5 mm y had little impact on lake expansion 0 41 m y the heterogeneous change in the two lakes from 1993 to 2005 was mainly due to water from cc being supplied to dc through a channel and the lake level of dc was always lower than that of cc until 2006 indicating that the geological condition around a lake is also an important factor in lake change the glacial meltwater from the puruogangri and geladandong glaciers which supplied water to dc and cc was approximately 0 01 0 006 km3 y and 0 067 0 018 km3 y respectively during 2000 2016 based on modis albedo products zhang et al 2018 under the assumption that all glacial meltwater was supplied to the two lakes through runoff with minimal evaporation glacial meltwater contributed approximately 19 3 4 5 of the total lake expansion of dc and cc 0 4 km3 y from 2003 to

6135,lake water storage is an important factor in analyses of lake water balance however it is difficult to calculate the water storage of lakes on the tibetan plateau due to the lack of bathymetric data lake water storage and changes in chibuzhang co cc and duoersuodong co dc which are located in an endorheic system and have been connected since 2006 were estimated based on in situ bathymetric data satellite altimetry data and landsat images of the central tibetan plateau in 2016 the maximum depth and water storage of dc were 68 7 m and 12 2 1 72 km3 respectively with an area of 490 2 km2 and those of cc were 116 3 m and 16 2 2 27 km3 respectively with an area of 575 4 km2 the total lake water storage in dc and cc increased by 24 5 2 4 km3 and 14 1 2 km3 from 2003 to 2014 respectively based on satellite altimetry data and landsat images using an empirical equation the relationship between lake changes and meteorological factors indicated that both increased glacial meltwater and increased precipitation were important drivers of each lake s expansion and that a small increase in evaporation 2 5 mm y had little negative impact on lake expansion 0 41 m y heterogeneous changes in the two lakes from 1993 to 2005 were mainly due to water from cc supplying dc through a channel and the lake level of dc was always lower than that of cc until 2006 indicating that the geological conditions around both lakes were also an important factor in the lake changes the assumption was that all glacial meltwater from the puruogangri and geladandong glaciers was supplied to the two lakes through runoff with minimal evaporation and glacial meltwater made an approximately 19 3 4 5 contribution to the lake expansions 0 4 km3 y of dc and cc from 2003 to 2014 based on the results of the glacier mass balance keywords bathymetric data water storage lake expansion glacial meltwater 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp has been described as the third pole and the asian water tower and many of the major asian rivers that originate on the tp are maintained by surface runoff immerzeel et al 2010 e g the yellow river yangtze river and brahmaputra river which together supply water to nourish hundreds of millions of people there many glaciers and lakes across the tp which are sensitive to climate change and have considerable influence on the regional hydrological cycle through land breeze circulation and changes in regional precipitation samuelsson and tjernström 2001 zhao et al 2012 the climate of the tp has experienced great changes in recent decades and the air temperature 0 036 c y and lake surface temperature 0 03 c y showed rising trends from 2001 to 2012 according to the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land surface temperature data zhang et al 2014b nearly 90 of the meteorological stations on the tp showed increased annual precipitation from 1961 to 2001 xu et al 2008 most glaciers on the tp have experienced significant shrinkage but most lakes on the tp have experienced a rapid expansion since 1994 except for several lakes in the southern tp since 2000 lei et al 2014 li et al 2014b phan et al 2012 wang et al 2013 song et al 2013 2014a b yao et al 2012 zhang et al 2011b 2014a 2017 lake expansion floods roads and meadows therefore lake expansion has a serious influence on the regional environment and animal husbandry and many studies have analyzed the causes of lake changes most previous studies have mainly focused on lake areas wan et al 2014 zhang et al 2014a 2015 and lake levels phan et al 2012 song et al 2014a zhang et al 2011b whereas only a few studies have focused on changes in lake water storage qiao et al 2019 qiao and zhu 2017 song et al 2014a zhang et al 2011b 2017 lake water storage change is a better indicator of responses to climate change than lake area change because the topographic conditions around lakes are different qiao et al 2017 for example a lake with steep slopes may experience less area change than a lake in a gently sloping basin even though the former may receive more inflowing water than the latter lake water storage change can be estimated by combining satellite radar altimetry data and landsat images the ice cloud and land elevation satellite icesat with a 70 m footprint has been widely used to study lake level and water storage changes in large lakes li et al 2014b phan et al 2012 song et al 2013 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2011b from 2003 to 2009 the cryosat 2 mission was launched in april 2010 the altimetry data from the satellite provided earth surface measurements with a footprint of approximately 290 m which were also used to analyze lake levels and water storage changes in large lakes with high precision jiang et al 2017 kleinherenbrink et al 2015 lee et al 2016 song et al 2015a b lake water storage and underwater topography are also important information in lake research the variation in lake heat storage is an important component used for estimating evaporation in deep lakes where the lake heat storage is dependent upon absolute water storage mcmahon et al 2013 the underwater topography of large lakes is very helpful for further studies of the paleoenvironment and water energy conversions e g how to select a suitable site for sediment drilling wang et al 2017 xu et al 2019 and water temperature observations at different depths huang et al 2017 lazhu et al 2015 there is little research on lake water storage and underwater topography due to the lack of bathymetric data and other available data if the bathymetric data of the lake are known the underwater topography and water storage can be calculated using a spatial interpolation method however most lakes on the tp are distributed across remote regions that are inaccessible and only a few lakes have been surveyed using bathymetric equipment e g nam co zhang et al 2011a four lakes on the northwestern tp qiao et al 2017 and paiku co on the southern tp lei et al 2018 the cause of tp lake changes is still debated and some previous studies considered that increased precipitation may be the main cause of lake expansion based on an analysis of the relationship between the annual precipitation change trend and annual lake area and lake level changes and by quantifying the contribution of each factor to lake change using a hydrological model lei et al 2013 song et al 2014b zhou et al 2015 by analyzing the annual change in lake surface evaporation researchers found that decreasing lake evaporation contributed approximately 4 to the rapid lake expansion of nam co ma et al 2016 li et al 2014b speculated that the main cause of tp lake expansion was permafrost degradation because most lake expansion had occurred in the area of the tp where considerable permafrost was distributed and glaciers experienced less retreats however based on the measurement data and remote sensing images most glaciers have experienced significant shrinkage on the tp yao et al 2012 increased glacial meltwater may have an important contribution to lake expansion li et al 2014a meng et al 2011 zhang et al 2011b 2015 zhu et al 2010 according to a comparison of the glacier elevation differences in the five pairs of tandem cossc datasets between 2013 and 2014 and srtm in 2000 the decadal glacier mass balance in the western nyainqentanglha mountains was calculated for the 2000 to 2014 period and the results indicated that the contribution of glacial meltwater to the lake expansion of nam co was likely 10 5 9 li and lin 2017 a comparison of the glacier surface elevation difference between spot 6 7 stereo imagery and srtm revealed that glacial meltwater contributed 9 9 and 11 1 to the lake expansions of lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake respectively on the central tp zhou et al 2019 the results of zhu et al 2010 indicated that although precipitation played a dominant role in maintaining the water balance increased glacial meltwater made a 50 6 contribution to the lake expansion of nam co based on a quantification of the proportions of different factors glacial meltwater was considered to have made an equivalent contribution to lake expansion with precipitation evaporation according to a comparison of the difference between the change in water storage of glacier fed and non glacier fed lakes in the tanggula mountains song and sheng 2016 northwestern tp qiao and zhu 2017 and inner tp qiao and zhu 2019 due to the lack of reliable measurement data on mass balance and meteorological data quantification of the contribution of glacial meltwater to lake expansion has mainly concentrated on several large lakes and many more lakes must be included in future studies in this paper the lake depth distributions of cc and dc which are located in an endorheic system on the central tp were surveyed in 2016 using a lowrance hds5 instrument the bathymetric data were used to establish the underwater topography and estimate lake water storage we estimated lake water storage changes over a long time scale from 2003 to 2014 by combining altimetry data icesat and cryosat 2 and landsat images the purposes of this study were as follows 1 to analyze the characteristics of the underwater topography and estimate water storage 2 to estimate changes in water storage from 2003 to 2014 3 to analyze the possible linkage between lake changes and climatic factors and 4 to quantify the contribution of glacial meltwater to lake expansion 2 study area the study region is located in the transitional zone between the monsoon dominated south and the dry continental westerly dominated north thompson et al 2006 the annual average temperature of this region is approximately 4 c based on data from the regional meteorological station and the annual precipitation is less than 500 mm with 90 of the precipitation occurring from may to september zhou et al 2014 puruogangri is one of the largest ice fields outside of the arctic and antarctic with a glacier area of approximately 420 km2 and an ice volume of approximately 52 km3 yi et al 2002 the ice core records from the puruogangri glaciers suggested that abrupt warming began in the early 20th century and continued until 2000 and this region was influenced more by continental climatic processes than by the monsoon because the low high δ18o was similar to that in the dunde ice core to the north but opposite to that in the dasuopu ice core in the himalayas thompson et al 2006 strengthened westerlies would increase the precipitation in this region yao et al 2012 understanding the changes in lake levels and water storage in lakes fed by this ice cap would help to complement information provided by the paleoclimate records most tp lakes are tectonic lakes and the total watershed of the study region is located in a large discontinuous mountain basin controlled by the bangong nujiang tectonic belt as shown in fig 1 cc 90 37 e 33 47 n and dc 89 90 e 33 43 n are twin lakes that are connected by a channel in the initial period pre 2006 only dc was endorheic while water from cc flowed into dc through a channel during the later period both lakes merged and formed one single endorheic system jiang et al 2017 the levels of the two lakes increased quickly over the last decade and increased glacial meltwater may have made similar contribution to lake expansion as that of precipitation evaporation song and sheng 2016 cc receives a glacial meltwater supply from the geladandong glaciers via three large rivers which are located on the eastern side of this lake approximately 60 km from cc fig 1 an upstream lake is located in the northeastern part of cc dc also receives a glacial meltwater supply from the puruogangri glaciers through a large river fig 1 which is located to the west of this lake approximately 50 km from dc glacier surface elevation changes have been reported based on different methods specially the glacier surface elevation decreased by 6 2 m from 1974 to 2000 lei et al 2012 and by 0 046 0 082 m w e a 1 from 2000 to 2011 zhang et al 2018 and the thinning rate was 0 317 0 027 m y from 2012 to 2016 liu et al 2016 most glaciers in the tangguala mountains have been retreating since the 1960s tseng et al 2016 the geladandong glacier area decreased by 66 68 km2 7 37 of the total glacier area from 1992 to 2009 zhou et al 2014 and the glacier surface elevation thinning rate was 0 22 0 12 m y from 1973 to 2000 zhou et al 2018 based on icesat laser altimetry measurements and 0 243 0 066 m w e a 1 from 2000 2016 zhang et al 2018 based on modis albedo products 3 methods 3 1 multi temporal landsat images for lake area extraction landsat multispectral scanner thematic mapper tm enhanced thematic mapper plus etm operational land image images were used to extract the lake areas because no images were available for the years 1989 1991 1995 1997 and 1999 we only calculated the lake area in 1976 1988 1990 1992 1993 1994 1996 and 1998 and from 2000 to 2016 these images were downloaded from the u s geological survey http glovis usgs gov the lake level of most lakes on the tp showed large increases during the warm seasons march october and declines or minor fluctuations during the cold seasons november february song et al 2014a to compare the inter annual changes and reduce the seasonal variation influence only the images obtained between september and november were selected because the lake levels were at their highest during these months allowing us to compare the largest area change of the lakes over a given year in recent decades the highest quality images with the least amount of clouds and snow were prioritized and detailed information on the images use is provided in table 1 the normalized difference water index ndwi method was used to extract the lake areas mcfeeters 1996 the detailed process of this method is as follows 1 the image was processed by radiometric correction to eliminate or correct image distortion caused by radiation error process 2 the band ratio method was used with the green band and near infrared nir band to calculate the pixel value ratio in different bands of the same image with the equation ndwi green nir green nir 3 the color slice range of 0 1 was chosen to extract the water body boundary as a shapefile and 4 the error boundary was modified by manual interpretation 3 2 bathymetric data for estimating water storage bathymetric data from the lake were surveyed in situ in october 2016 a lowrance hds5 which has a vertical accuracy of 0 01 m was used to survey the lake depth and bathymetric data were recorded every second the measured route is shown in fig 2 a total of 0 68 million points were measured which covered the main region of the two lakes except for three small areas which were located in the western parts of cc and dc and the southeastern part of cc fig 2 all bathymetric data with latitude longitude and depth used for establishing the underwater topography of two lakes are provided in appendix these data were used to estimate lake water storage which essentially represented the actual lake water storage we combined the bathymetric data and lake shoreline data to establish the underwater topography and we assigned the depth value of the lake shoreline as 0 to reduce interpolation bias the topo to raster tool is an interpolation method specifically designed for the creation of a hydrologically correct digital elevation model dem and an iterative finite difference interpolation technique was used hutchinson 1988 1989 using spatial analyst tools topo to raster in arcgis 9 3 to establish the underwater topography with grid units of 56 m 56 m water storage was estimated based on a given lake depth using the area and volume tool of 3d analyst in arcgis 3 3 altimetry data to calculate lake level change the altimetry data from icesat and cryosat 2 have been widely used to monitor lake level changes on the tp jiang et al 2017 phan et al 2012 song et al 2014a zhang et al 2011b the geoscience laser altimeter system glas onboard icesat has provided global altimetry data for approximately 20 one month campaigns since january 2003 song et al 2013 the national snow and ice data center nsidc archived all the original datasets and distributed icesat s level 2 global land surface altimetry data product gla14 we used the nsidc glas altimetry elevation extractor tool ngat to extract the time series elevation with latitude longitude and geoid information from the glas14 altimetry products the narrow primary peak threshold nppt retracker jain et al 2015 was applied to the cryosat 2 data which had previously been proven to provide valid results for inland water application nielsen et al 2015 villadsen et al 2016 1 r r wd r r r gc where rwd is the window delay rr is the retracker correction and rgc are the geophysical corrections including the ionosphere wet and dry troposphere solid earth tide ocean loading tide and pole tide the surface elevation h with respect to the earth gravitational model of 2008 geoid egm2008 was obtained using the following equation 2 h h r n where h is the satellite altitude and n is the geoid height with respect to the ellipsoid icesat and data cryosat 2 covered the periods from 2003 to 2009 and 2010 to 2015 respectively and the height of the icesat data was converted from egm1996 to egm2008 which was consistent with the cryosat 2 data we calculated the average lake level on the same day as the lake level and we calculated the standard deviation of these data on the same day to determine the accuracy and bias of the average lake level we used these data to reconstruct lake level changes from 2003 to 2014 3 4 estimation of lake water storage change there are several methods used to estimate lake water storage change such as using an empirical equation based on the relationship between lake area and lake level qiao et al 2017 song et al 2013 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 or to estimate based on underwater topography qiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2011a because three small areas of the two lakes were not measured using bathymetric data and the lake area change in these two lakes was mainly concentrated in these areas western dc and southeastern cc the lake water storage change could not be accurately estimated based on the underwater topography and time series change in the lake area as reported by qiao et al 2017 and zhang et al 2011a in this study we obtained the lake level change from the icesat and cryosat 2 altimetry data and the lake area change from multi temporal landsat images an empirical equation was used to estimate water storage changes based on changes in lake area and level 3 δ v 1 3 s 1 s 1 s 2 s 2 δ h s1 and s2 represent the lake areas for two periods h represents the lake level change during the two periods and v represents the water storage change during the two periods 3 5 the meteorological data used to analyze the causes of lake variations the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd covering 1979 2013 was developed by the institute of tibetan plateau research chinese academy of sciences he and yang 2011 these datasets were assimilated by combining the meteorological data from 740 stations of the china meteorological administration cma princeton meteorological forcing data sheffield et al 2006 and the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b42 precipitation products huffman et al 2007 these datasets included near surface temperature precipitation pressure wind speed and specific humidity with temporal and spatial resolutions of 3 h and 0 1 respectively the dataset was used to analyze the annual precipitation and annual average temperature change trend from 1979 to 2013 the penman equation penman 1948 has been widely and successfully used for estimating open water evaporation mcmahon et al 2013 because actual evaporation information is difficult to acquire on the tp we used the penman equation to estimate the potential evaporation ep of the lake surface water based on data from 56 meteorological stations on the tp and to estimate their spatial distributions using the kriging interpolation method in arcgis the daily maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity sunshine duration and wind velocity data at each meteorological station were used to calculate ep from 1976 to 2013 4 ep δ

cover of hoh xil lake occurred in the middle of october to early december and complete melting occurred from early may to the middle of june yao et al 2015 sublimation from the lake surface ice could be considered negligible due to the low temperature in this region during winter ma et al 2016 we assume that the evaporation from december to april is 0 and that evaporation during the other months represents the annual ep 4 results 4 1 the characteristics of the underwater topography and lake water storage as shown in fig 2 22 transects were measured which covered the main region of the two lakes there were 445 549 and 240 472 measurement points in cc and dc respectively and the maximum depths and lake area were 116 3 m and 575 4 km2 and 68 7 m and 490 2 km2 respectively lake underwater topography and depth isobaths were reconstructed based on the bathymetric data the maximum depth of cc was located in the southern area of the lake and the topography was very steep the maximum depth of dc was located in the central part of the lake a large area of this region was greater than 60 m deep and the topography was gentle the profile graph tools on the 3d analyst interactive toolbar were used to derive a graphic representation in one profile using this tool six profiles of the two lakes were derived as shown in fig 2 six profiles were derived based on the underwater topography the maximum depth profiles were profiles a and f which were located in cc and the shallowest was profile d which was located in the western cc as shown in profiles a e and f the underwater topography of cc was very steep especially in the southern part of this lake which showed intensive isobaths the topography of dc was undulating based on profiles b and c and the average depth was shallower than that of cc a small lake connects the two large lakes which is located in the middle of dc and cc the topography is gentle in this lake and the maximum depth of this lake is less than 40 m lake water storage can be estimated based on the underwater topography because the scope of the bathymetric data did not cover both lakes entirely with data missing for the western part of dc and the southeastern and northwestern parts of cc the estimated lake water storage should be less than that of the actual water storage however the bathymetric data covered the main region of the two lakes and we are confident that the estimation of lake water storage satisfactorily represents the actual water storage based on the underwater topography the lake water storage of dc was at least 12 2 1 72 km3 and the average depth of this lake was 31 7 m in 2016 we calculated the lake water storage in cc including that of the small lake connecting the two large lakes the water storage of the small lake was at least 1 85 0 26 km3 and the average depth of this lake was 14 2 m in 2016 the water storage of the main lake in cc was at least 14 3 2 01 km3 and the average depth of this lake was 37 7 m in 2016 although the maximum depth of cc was approximately twice that of dc the average depths of the two lakes were nearly the same 4 2 changes in lake area and level as shown in fig 3 the lake area of cc increased slightly from 1976 to 1988 whereas that of dc experienced a decreasing trend during this period both lakes remained stable during 1988 1993 cc shrank during 1993 1996 and then remained stable during 1996 2004 and the lake area began to increase after 2005 5 3 km2 y the lake area of dc underwent a rapid increase from 1996 to 2005 subsequently the increased rate of the lake area 9 9 km2 y from 2006 to 2016 was lower than the rate during 1996 2005 2 8 km2 y the two lakes showed different types of changes in the different periods but both lakes exhibited a rapidly increased rate after 2005 as shown in fig 4 a the standard deviation of the cc lake level was much higher than that of dc but the lake level of cc was consistent with that of dc after 2010 the lake levels of cc and dc were not consistent before 2006 and the lake level of cc was approximately 1 m higher than that of dc in 2004 according to the srtm dem which acquired dem data for over 80 of the globe during an 11 day mission in february 2000 the lake level of cc was approximately 6 m higher than that of dc these results indicated that even though the two lakes were connected by a channel the amount of water inflow to dc from cc was limited because the channel was narrow before 2006 the increased rate of the dc lake area was much faster during 1996 2005 than that during 2006 2016 but cc exhibited a stable state during 1996 2005 the main cause was that the difference in lake levels was narrowing with the supply from cc to dc until the lake levels of both lakes were consistent in 2006 however as the lake level continued to increase once the level in each lake increased to a particular threshold the levels of the two lakes were consistent and maintained the same rates thereafter the average increased rate of the lake was 0 41 m y from 2006 to 2014 and the increased rate during 2011 2014 0 53 m y was faster than that during 2006 2011 0 34 m y 4 3 lake water storage change as shown in fig 4b the lake area of cc decreased by 0 5 km2 from 2003 to 2004 and the lake level and water storage decreased by 0 3 m and 0 14 km3 respectively during this period the lake area of dc increased by 9 5 km2 and the lake level and water storage increased by 0 38 m and 0 17 km3 respectively from 2003 to 2004 the lake water storage began to increase after 2004 and the increased rate of dc 0 22 km3 y was higher than that of cc 0 18 km3 y from 2003 to 2014 the increased water storage of dc and cc was 2 4 km3 and 2 km3 respectively over the period 2003 2014 the greatest increase in water storage of cc was 0 38 km3 during 2011 2012 and 0 4 km3 during 2012 2013 and the increase was 0 33 km3 and 0 35 km3 in dc during the same periods respectively water storage in dc and cc had increased by 24 5 and 14 1 since 2003 respectively 4 4 inter annual variations in meteorological factors as shown in fig 5 we analyzed only the change trends in the annual precipitation annual average temperature and annual evaporation from 1976 to 2013 the average precipitation was 309 5 mm y ranging from 190 9 mm 1994 to 529 9 mm 2005 during 1979 2013 it also showed a significant variation with an average of 281 8 mm y ranging from 190 9 mm 1994 to 413 2 mm 1996 during 1979 2000 followed by a slight increased trend with significant variation the average annual precipitation was 356 4 mm y ranging from 221 8 2006 to 529 9 mm 2005 during 2001 2013 fig 5a the linear regression method with spss software was used to calculate the rates of increase or decrease the annual average temperature exhibited a significantly increased trend with a rate of 0 026 c y r2 0 39 p less than 0 05 and the annual average temperature was 5 76 c during 1979 2013 r2 0 67 the lowest annual average temperature occurred in 1997 with an annual average temperature of 7 8 c fig 5b the annual evaporation showed significant variation with an increased trend 2 5 mm y r2 0 67 p less than 0 01 ranging from 1194 1 mm 1979 to 1354 1 mm 1999 during 1976 2013 and the average evaporation was 1284 7 mm y during this period fig 5c the change trends in the monthly precipitation and average monthly temperature are shown in fig 6 the lowest temperatures mainly occurred in november december january and february the highest temperatures mainly occurred in june july and august and the average temperature in august was approximately 5 c with a significantly increased trend from 1979 to 2013 fig 6a most of the precipitation mainly occurred in june july august and september with significant variations fig 6b the precipitation showed a decreasing trend from 1979 to 1985 and then increased with significant variations until 2013 the precipitation levels in 2005 and 2007 were lower than those in other years 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties in water storage estimation based on bathymetric data using bathymetric and altimetry data is an effective method to estimate lake water storage change qiao et al 2017 song et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 however there are certain uncertainties in lake water storage estimation based on underwater topography because bathymetric data only cover part of the lake estimating lake water storage change using an empirical equation based on altimetry data and landsat images provides much higher precision than that achieved with bathymetric data we considered the results of water storage change from altimetry data as a truth value to compare the accuracy of bathymetric data bathymetric data of bangdag co from qiao et al 2017 covered the main area of the lake which could be used to estimate changes in water storage by combining landsat images we also estimated the water storage change in bangdag co based on altimetry data icesat and cryosat 2 and landsat images from 2004 to 2014 except for 2006 2009 and 2013 missing data and compared the accuracy of the two results the error was much larger when water storage underwent a small change e g 2004 2005 and 2010 2011 and the error was lower when water storage underwent a large change e g 2004 2008 and 2011 2014 the error in the estimated change in lake water storage based on bathymetric data was 12 8 with respect to the results from altimetry data therefore we considered that the error of lake water storage estimation was approximately 12 8 lake water storage change can also be estimated by combining the underwater topography from bathymetric data and data on changes in lake water level and comparing these results with the results from altimetry data and landsat images the assumption is that the lake level from 2014 to 2016 was consistent because the lake area changed little during this period the results from altimetry data suggested a larger change compared with the results derived from bathymetric data table 2 with an error of 23 2 which was larger than the error for the results of bangdag co 12 8 the reason for this difference could be that bathymetric data were not available for part of the area with increased water storage e g the western part of dc and the southeastern part of cc 5 2 geological conditions because the terrain of the tp is complex the topography around the lakes has an important influence on lake changes upstream lakes receive glacial meltwater directly from glaciers that supply downstream lakes and the area and level of upstream lakes remain stable whereas downstream lakes continue to expand quickly qiao and zhu 2017 song and sheng 2016 water seepage may be an important cause of lake change and nam co may have been affected by seepage because of a lake water imbalance based on the observed water surface evaporation and river runoff data zhou et al 2013 phan et al 2013 analyzed the relationship between tp lakes and glacial runoff based on geometric characteristics indicated that tp lakes depend more or less on glacial meltwater in which there were glaciers in these watersheds as shown in fig 7 the two lakes were connected in 1973 however the channel was narrow and the lake water supply from the cc was limited because a dam intercepted the water from the cc it was difficult for the two lakes to reach the same level in a short time and both lakes remained stable during 1988 1993 however the lake area of dc began to increase quickly after 1993 and the channel connecting the dam began to widen with the rising lake level however cc remained in a stable state suggesting that most of the increased water storage in cc was supplied to dc the lake level of the two lakes was consistent in 2006 and the water channel was sufficiently wide for water to flow from cc to dc until the lake levels equalized suggesting that the geological conditions around the lake are an important factor in lake changes 5 3 climate factors changes in precipitation and evaporation have direct impacts on lake changes and glacial meltwater increases with rising temperatures as shown in fig 6b even though the precipitation had a fluctuating increased trend the lake area maintained a steady rate of expansion after 1996 suggesting that the precipitation was not the only cause of lake expansion the rate of rising temperature was faster during 2000 2006 than that during any other periods and the average temperature in summer also rose during 1979 2013 which may have increased the flow of glacial meltwater to the lakes the geladandong and puruogangri glaciers have experienced significant shrinkage in recent years guo et al 2015 liu et al 2016 neckel et al 2014 wei et al 2014 increased evaporation 2 5 mm y had little impact on the rising lake level 0 41 m y during 2006 2015 both increased glacial meltwater and precipitation had been considered the main causes of lake expansion however due to the lack of observational data and other reliable satellite data it was difficult to quantify the contribution of the different factors to lake expansion and analyze the main cause of lake changes 5 4 glacial meltwater most glaciers on the tp have experienced significant retreat in recent years yao et al 2012 and increased glacial meltwater can bring much more glacial water to the lakes however the contribution of glacial meltwater to lake expansion is difficult to quantify due to a lack of measurement data and reliable satellite data altimetry data e g icesat or cryosat 2 were used to calculate glacier surface elevation change ke et al 2015 neckel et al 2014 but the altimetry data only covered part of the glacier surface on the tp which may not represent change in the glacier surface elevation of the glaciers multi temporal dems have been widely used to research changes in glacier surface elevation by comparing the differences over times and these measurements can cover the entire glacier surface brun et al 2017 li and lin 2017 liu et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 for example the terrasar tsx add on for the digital elevation measurement tandem x mission was launched in 2010 by the german aerospace center and the primary objective of this mission was to generate a global high accuracy and homogeneous dem following the high standard of accuracy for high resolution terrain information tandem x has been widely used to calculate glacier elevation change with high accuracy li and lin 2017 liu et al 2016 and the multi temporal aster is also used to generate new dems and calculate glacier surface elevation changes by comparing the difference in dems brun et al 2017 rivera et al 2005 table 3 lists the result of glacier mass balances for the puruogangri and geladandong region from different studies which vary in spatial and temporal coverage as well as used techniques a comparison of these studies indicates a periodic shift in glacier thinning rates over the puruogangri balanced or slightly negative glacier mass balance 0 044 0 015 m w e a 1 for the period of 2000 2012 huintjes et al 2015 neckel et al 2013 and more negative mass balances 0 269 0 025 m w e a 1 for the period of 2012 2016 liu et al 2016 the mean mass balance for the two periods was consistent with that in the study by zhang et al 2018 which was 0 046 0 082 m w e a 1 and 0 294 0 134 m w e a 1 respectively we thus used the result of 2000 2016 0 113 0 068 m w e a 1 from zhang et al 2018 for the mean glacier mass balance over the puruogangri similar to the case for puruogangri the results of the study by zhang et al 2018 for the two periods in geladandong glaciers were also consistent with previous results chao et al 2017 liu 2016 liu et al 2017 for example the glacier mass balance of geladandong was 0 128 0 049 m w e a 1 during 2000 2012 based on the study by liu 2016 and 0 134 0 056 m w e a 1 during 2003 2009 based on the study by chao et al 2017 which was consistent with the results of in zhang et al 2018 namely 0 143 0 008 m w e a 1 furthermore the lacier mass balance for the eastern part of the geladandong glaciers was 0 155 0 048 m w e a 1 during 2000 2012 based on the study by liu 2016 which was also consistent with the result in the study by zhang et al 2018 namely 0 146 0 008 m w e a 1 we thus used the 2000 2016 result 0 243 0 066 m w e a 1 from zhang et al 2018 for the mean glacier mass balance over the geladandong glaciers in our study region are located in the western puruogangri and eastern geladandong and the glacier areas were 91 55 km2 and 74 59 km2 in 2007 respectively according to the second chinese glacier inventory guo et al 2015 which constituted 21 8 and 32 5 of the glaciers area found by zhang et al 2018 respectively we used the mean glacier mass balance results from zhang et al 2018 to estimate glacial meltwater in this study the two lakes receive glacial meltwater from the eastern glaciers of puruogangri and western glaciers of geladandong and the amount of glacial meltwater from the two glaciers was approximately 0 01 0 006 km3 y and 0 067 0 018 km3 y from 2000 to 2016 respectively based on glacier area and mass balance data the assumption was that all glacial meltwater supplied to the two lakes was through runoff with minimal evaporation which contributed approximately 19 3 4 5 of the total lake expansion of dc and cc 0 4 km3 y from 2003 to 2014 6 conclusion in this study we used bathymetric data to acquire underwater topography data using a spatial interpolation method for two lakes dc and cc on the central tp the maximum depth and water storage of the two lakes were 68 7 m and 12 2 1 72 km3 respectively with an area of 490 2 km2 for dc and 116 3 m and 16 2 2 27 km3 respectively with an area of 575 4 km2 for cc in 2016 the increased water storage in dc and cc was 2 4 km3 and 2 km3 respectively from 2003 to 2014 based on satellite altimetry data icesat and cryosat 2 and landsat images the relationship between lake change and meteorological factors indicated that increased glacial meltwater and increased precipitation were important causes for lake expansion whereas increased evaporation 2 5 mm y had little impact on lake expansion 0 41 m y the heterogeneous change in the two lakes from 1993 to 2005 was mainly due to water from cc being supplied to dc through a channel and the lake level of dc was always lower than that of cc until 2006 indicating that the geological condition around a lake is also an important factor in lake change the glacial meltwater from the puruogangri and geladandong glaciers which supplied water to dc and cc was approximately 0 01 0 006 km3 y and 0 067 0 018 km3 y respectively during 2000 2016 based on modis albedo products zhang et al 2018 under the assumption that all glacial meltwater was supplied to the two lakes through runoff with minimal evaporation glacial meltwater contributed approximately 19 3 4 5 of the total lake expansion of dc and cc 0 4 km3 y from 2003 to

6136,secure workings in underground coal mines usually require the lowering of water levels via pumping after mine closure pump systems are stopped and the water level recovers in a process known as groundwater rebound in the asturian coal basin spain the closure and flooding of underground coal mines carries associated environmental impacts that ought to be assessed among them those related with groundwater flow and pollutant transport are of main interest to evaluate the environmental risks during and after mine closure the construction of numerical flow models is suggested which rely on an appropriate conceptualization of the mine hydrogeological system underground mines of this region are characterized by very steep coal seams due to a folded and faulted geological structure the resulting geometry translates into a complex network of hundreds of kilometers of mine tunnels and galleries this is a challenge for the construction of numerical models in issues like geometrical problems assignation of hydraulic parameters coupling of physical laws and high computational cost this paper presents the conceptual and numerical model of two linked mines of the region mosquitera and pumarabule that recently ended the flooding stage to be used in assessment of post closure environmental risks to implement the geometry of the underground mine a methodological approach to translate the mining information to the numerical simulator has been developed that retains the hydraulic behavior of the key underground mine elements a methodological approach for coupled simulation of mine conduits and porous media flow has been explicitly adapted the results in terms of the velocity distribution field inside the mine and possible outflow sites are useful to provide a basis for later extension of transport models and assessment of hydro chemical impacts on the area keywords mine closure underground coal mining asturian coal basin environmental risks conceptual model numerical modeling 1 introduction managing of environmental risks during and after coal mine closure is an important matter of concern in a scenario in which many exploitations have closed or will do soon in europe didier 2009 klinger et al 2011 bondaruk et al 2013 younger 2016 such is the case of numerous mines in asturias spain moreno and lópez 2008 jardón et al 2013 within this context it has been urged by the european commission 2013 to undertake actions to mitigate the negative environmental impacts of the european raw materials sector recently krzemień et al 2016 proposed a methodology for environmental risk management with the objective of achieving a sustainable mine closure and within this framework a fundamental stage is the evaluation of water related risks klinger et al 2012 a well known strategy within the hydrogeological community to evaluate and predict water related impacts is the construction of groundwater flow and transport numerical models e g anderson et al 2015 computational models include relevant information related to hydrological parameters and detailed geometry to solve the governing equations of the processes occurring in the system the outcomes in terms of distribution of state variables over time and space are useful to provide estimations e g of pollutants and discharges or take actions to avoid water related environmental impacts modeling groundwater flow in underground mine systems is a difficult task due to the complexity of simulating water flow processes in the mine voids that differ from those encountered in classical porous aquifers where darcy s laminar flow law is applicable wolkersdorfer 2008 however flow through the aquifers in which the mine is embedded should not be disregarded as happens with some processes like recharge e g ordóñez et al 2012 a strategy that combines both flow regimes is therefore needed that assures mass continuity this should be done in a computationally efficient way to support further developments such as transport of contaminants or heat for geothermal applications previous works have undertaken the simulation of water flow in underground mines the modelling solutions adopted vary but can be classified in two main groups a semi distributed box type and b physically based models box type models have been satisfactorily utilized in water rebound studies that is to predict the flooding after mine closure these models use the concept of interconnected ponds where the water budget is computed younger 2002 some examples are gram sherwood and younger 1997 or mifim banks 2001 physically based models usually take advantage of existing groundwater numerical codes such as the vss net component of shetran ewen et al 2000 which was added in order to simulate turbulent flow in mine studies adams and younger 2001 or the well known modflow harbaugh 2005 and feflow diersch 2013 the modelling of underground mine reservoirs especially in the asturian basin is a complex task derived from the intricate geometry and layout of the underground voids that are embedded into and should be hydraulically coupled to the porous media for example the steep coal panels linked by galleries at different levels would be extremely difficult or almost impossible to accommodate using finite difference codes with prismatic elements such as modflow additionally the hundreds of kilometres of galleries are not feasible to be implemented as three dimensional elements and the hundreds of interconnected branches would cause numerical instabilities in the calculation of water flow in the conduits this work presents the conceptual and numerical groundwater flow model of the flooded underground coal mine reservoir of mosquitera and pumarabule in asturias northern spain as a novelty a methodological approach to incorporate mining information into a groundwater model that addresses some peculiarities found in the asturian coal region derived from the characteristic geological settings is explained the results provide information about groundwater flow and distribution of pressures in the mine and in the surrounding massif water velocities and flow regimes in the mine conduits and risks of groundwater flooding after mine water rebound and discharge of contaminated mine waters the model constitutes the basis for further studies encompassing water rebound reactive transport and geothermal models 2 background and site description 2 1 coal mining in asturias first testimonials of coal exploitation in asturias spain come from the second half of 18th century in the 19th century starts a more intensive and industrialized stage of activities due to a flourishing metallurgic industry anes and ojeda 1983 asturian mines have been characterized by difficulties of extracting coal due to the very complex geological settings commonly with existence of very steep coal seams of low thickness and limited spatial continuity highly fractured requiring very intensive manpower in 1967 the national company hunosa hulleras del norte sa was established with the objective to cluster all the mines and exploitation of the asturian carboniferous central coal region including those not making profits in the 1990s underground coal mines started to close in asturias a process within an industrial reconversion that led to closure of all non profitable mines in the region by the end of 2018 european commission 2010 2 2 geological and hydrogeological settings 2 2 1 structure the carboniferous central asturian coal basin ccb lies in the center of the principality of asturias with a total area of approx 1400 km2 see fig 1 from a geological point of view it belongs to the cantabrian zone of the iberian massif julivert 1971 the geological limits of the ccb are the mesozoic tertiary basin to the north the ponga nappe regions to the east the leon fault to the south and the aramo unit whose limit is the aramo thrust to the west the zone of study is placed at the north of the central coal basin on a highly folded and faulted area the main structures respond to the historical variscan and alpine main stresses with directions west east and north south fuente alonso and sáenz de santa maría benedict 1999 the mines of mosquitera and pumarabule are located to the eastern flank of the sama syncline see fig 1 this syncline fold has a hinge line direction approx n s and plunges smoothly to the south the axial surface dips to the east with an angle of around 70 to the east of the sama syncline two other folds have importance in the underground distribution of the mine exploitation areas the magdalena anticline is a tight fold with axial surface dipping to the east as well as el entrego syncline both with axis direction n s the general structure in a w e cross section is shown in fig 1 two main families of faults which approximately follow the same directions of the folding structures e w and n s are observed in the area the most important have n s or nne ssw direction remarkable in this group is la carrera fault a reverse fault not well known because it is developed in clay non productive materials fuente alonso and sáenz de santa maría benedict 1999 the second fault system is approximately orthogonal to the main one but are generally minor structures with less continuity the delineation of these faults is in many cases only possible through underground information and is revealed by changes in the position of the coal seams 2 2 2 stratigraphy the coal bearing sequence of the basin has been divided into two main units fig 2 a a lower unproductive unit called lena group westphalian a c 3500 m of deltaic and marine sediments mainly composed by limestones with sporadic thin and discontinuous coal seams mostly in its upper part and b an upper productive unit called sama group westphalian d that has a thickness of more than 2000 m and contains exploitable coal seams within an important sandy sequence with sporadic limestones within each unit a grouping was done into smaller entities called packs adaro 1926 garcía loygorri et al 1971 an informal mining term utilized to identify in the sequence the position of the exploitable coal seams in the area fig 2 only coal seams from the sama group were exploited in the mines of mosquitera and pumarabule the most recent in the stratigraphic sequence were those from the sorriego mining pack in mosquitera and the oldest from the generalas mining pack see figs 1 and 2 2 2 3 hydrogeological properties the hydrogeological properties of the carboniferous materials in the area are generally poor in terms of permeability and storage properties previous authors ordóñez et al 2012 álvarez et al 2016 have classified them into three hydrogeological groups a shales and siltstones with very low hydraulic conductivities of 10 7 10 8 m s 1 b carboniferous sandstones and conglomerates which show conductivities of around 10 6 m s 1 c carboniferous limestones and dolostones whose permeability vary according to the extent of the karstification these materials may have changed their natural properties in exploited zones according to the stresses extension and compression caused by the mine works see for example younger and adams 1999 2 3 mosquitera pumarabule mines 2 3 1 general characteristics the mine system under study includes the mines of pumarabule 1 and 2 mosquitera 1 mosquitera 2 and rosellón see shaft locations in fig 1 in total the underground workings extend over an area of more than 20 km2 and reach a depth of almost 600 m below the ground surface the first shaft of the pumarabule mine marta or pumarabule 1 was excavated in 1916 and operations began in 1917 the second shaft pumarabule 2 was excavated in 1957 less than 40 m away from the first shaft pumarabule 1 has a total depth of 242 m and pumarabule 2 reaches a depth of 578 m 292 masl pumarabule underground workings are distributed in 13 levels or floors with main transverse roadways of w e direction the main transverses connect the shaft with the galleries that allowed access to the exploitation areas and are approximately aligned with the strike direction n s of the coal layers the galleries extend to the north of transverses with a length between 400 and 800 m to the south the galleries reach further with lengths up to 1500 m in the exploitation zones coal panels of high dips around 70 were exploited using manual methods with backfilling mosquitera 1 was concluded in 1929 and mosquitera 2 started its production in 1946 mosquitera 1 has a maximum depth of 566 m 296 masl and mosquitera 2 reaches a maximum depth of 477 m 204 masl in december 1989 a fire in the 7th level of mosquitera 1 caused the death of seven miners and the shaft was closed from that date pumarabule was used to continue the exploitation of coal until its closure in 2005 the underground distribution of mosquitera s mine workings is more complex than that of pumarabule s instead of a unique main transverse roadway per level in mosquitera there is one main transverse per shaft the main transverses of mosquitera 1 are longer than 2 km the shafts allow access to different underground levels 11 in mosquitera 1 and 7 in mosquitera 2 pumarabule and mosquitera mines are connected at 2nd 4th 7th and 8th floors this proprietary information gathered from different sources mainly data provided by the mining company hunosa historical records in the regional mining archives and the spanish geological survey igme and processed by the authors is fundamental to build the modelling geometry 2 3 2 water discharge and rebound in pumarabule mosquitera with the deepening of the underground workings to extract coal water pumping keeps areas dry and secure the depressed water level is later reverted after closure of the mine but the natural system has by then been largely affected and modified by the anthropic activity historical data for the pumarabule exploitation shows that for each ton of coal extracted between 15 and 25 tons of water was pumped for example in the period 1995 2001 the total production of coal was 8 105 t tonnes in the selected mines 1 85 0 2 t of raw materials to obtain 1 t of coal after washing and the water extracted in the same period was 1 6 107 m3 this is 2 1 105 t a 1 of raw material extracted and 2 3 106 m3 a 1 water pumped a factor of approximately 11 1 of water to raw material which is in the middle range of other coalfields in europe and in the world see fig 29 in wolkersdorfer 2008 residence times have not been estimated but previous studies e g jardón 2010 suggest delay times between 15 and 45 days since water is infiltrated until it is pumped out of the shafts extraction of coal in pumarabule mosquitera ended in 2004 dewatering pumps were stopped the 26th of october 2010 natural flooding of the mine occurred until a previously defined security level of 230 masl was reached in december 2014 it is a water elevation defined by the mining company to avoid unwanted discharges of contaminated mine water to the surface this level is maintained using five pumps three located in mosquitera 1 and two in pumarabule each one with a theoretical pumping capacity of 225 240 m3 h 1 by april 2016 after permission the company let the level risen to the current 235 masl fig 3 shows historical data of monthly pumping rates in both mines and the water rebound curve for the mosquitera mine pumarabule rebound curve is not shown as it perfectly matches mosquitera levels confirming the very good hydraulic connection between the two mines monthly water pumped in both shafts is shown in fig 3a the main pumping station is located in mosquitera 1 whereas additional pumps in pumarabule are utilized as backup for high rain periods pumping rate in mosquitera is higher during the wet season usually between november and may which shows the relation with precipitation patterns with highest pumping accumulated values of 0 2 0 3 hm3 month 1 all this information shows the structure of the geometry and dynamic relationships among the interlinked shafts 3 conceptual model development 3 1 objectives the groundwater model presented in this work aims to provide insights about water flow dynamics in the reservoir after the mines have been flooded and the pumps are reactivated to maintain the security level the objectives of the numerical groundwater model are to analyze the hydrodynamic characteristics e g water velocity in the galleries flow regime discharge volumes in different scenarios to provide a context for evaluation and further extension to include contaminant transport models that constitute the basis for environmental risk assessment after mine closure to proceed with the numerical evaluation it is necessary to define first the conceptual model which includes all what is known and relevant about the system and can be defined as an assembly of simplifications about a complex real system which achieves a valid representation of that system including all major features whilst avoiding unnecessary detail younger and adams 1999 3 2 general assumptions mine workings act as preferential pathways for groundwater akin to that of a karst aquifer wolkersdorfer 2008 the hydraulic properties of the geological medium surrounding the mine are also modified to an extent as consequence of the mining activity showing a higher increasing of permeability and porosity near the voids e g younger and adams 1999 the general flow behavior of the system can be conceptualized as a connected network of mine voids of different dimensionality that act as a large drainage system embedded in a massif partially altered after mining the main recharge is caused by rain the water that infiltrates through the porous media aquifer flow through the massif until percolates into the mine voids water is then conducted to discharge points located in the shafts where pumping is active to maintain a fixed security level 3 3 model extension and definition of boundary conditions the conceptual model has been given an extent of approximately 25 5 km2 fig 4 the limits have been defined using the geological information that assigns a very low permeability of the existent unaltered massifs that separates the studied mines from nearby workings to the east a no flow boundary is represented by the tendeyón mining pack fig 2 a thick sequence of shale materials of more than 500 m considered impervious the same formation provides the no flow boundary at the bottom of the model following the syncline structure at depths ranging between 2000 and 3000 m the northwest boundary is represented by la carrera fault a reverse fault or thrust not well known but considered impervious because it is developed in clay non productive materials fuente alonso and sáenz de santa maría benedict 1999 two closed mines are located further to the north of the study area toral aramil and at a larger distance a more important one named lieres fig 4 to the south a large mined zone exists with two closed mines candín sw and venturo se an unaltered protection massif acts as a separation boundary with all these exploitations analysis of historical records of pumping rates from these mines show no apparent connection and therefore it is assumed that no flow occurs between these mines and the reservoir under study the upper surface boundary is defined with detailed topography of the area recharge has been estimated using precipitation data from oviedo meteorological station located about 15 km from the study area and works from previous authors who estimated infiltration values for aquifers on the area of 104 álvarez et al 2016 and 110 mm year 1 muñoz de fraga 2015 these values represent around 22 26 of the average effective rainfall estimated in 450 mm year 1 by álvarez et al 2016 for the area of candín just southwest of the study area fig 1 finally the candín river see fig 1 the main river in the area is represented in the model as a line segment in the valley the main dewatering points of the system are the pumps located in the mine shafts these pumping facilities aim to keep the water level below the security height of 235 masl and are intermittently active when water level raises above the predefined level with higher pumping rates during wet season total annual pumping rates have ranged before flooding between 1 4 and 2 6 hm3 year 1 with a mean value of 2 091 hm3 year 1 fig 3b after flooding in 2015 the annual discharged volume was 2 06 hm3 in mosquitera supported by pumping of 0 5 hm3 in pumarabule that is 2 56 hm3 in total while in 2016 the total pumped was much lower 1 23 hm3 but the pumps stopped for some months to let the level rise from 230 to the current 235 masl fig 3 shows monthly pumping rates in mosquitera blue and pumarabule red 3 4 conceptualization of mine elements affecting groundwater flow mine voids including galleries roadways access works and shafts constitute the main pathways for rapid water flow in the model the large system of underground tunnels is there conceptualized as a large interconnected pipe system that conducts water to the discharge points in this case the pump systems located in the shafts galleries in asturian mines have an average cross section of 9 m2 although values range from those of less important secondary galleries sections of 6 m2 were identified in old mine plans to main roadways and landing areas located near the shaft which have sections of 20 m2 convergence due to overburden has been estimated to cause a reduction in section of galleries of about 5 10 ordóñez et al 2012 the average cross section of shafts is bigger and depends on the diameter of each shaft ranging between 4 3 m and 5 65 m exploitation zones coal panels suffer a transformation of their characteristics once coal has been extracted hydraulic properties vary depending on the method of exploitation compaction and subsidence reduce the original net volume once the exploitation is abandoned as coarse practical approximation values of porosity of 20 can be employed for filled exploitation zones and of 30 for collapsed ones jardón 2010 in compacted backfill material porosity can be reduced to less than 10 whereas collapsed sandstone can show porosities of 40 ordóñez et al 2010 in the study area values lower than 20 have been chosen after having analyzed exploitation methods for the altered massif the values of hydraulic conductivity are based on previous works in the area díaz noriega 2017 and values estimated in the literature e g younger and adams 1999 younger 2011 the unaltered massif is considered to have very low permeability with hydraulic conductivity values generally lower than 10 7m s 1 reaching 5 10 6 m s 1 in fractured zones álvarez et al 2016 a summary of values utilized are shown in table 1 4 groundwater numerical model development 4 1 modeling objectives available data are very scarce the only available information are water levels measured in the shafts monthly discharge rates necessary to keep levels at the 235 masl security height and piezometric heads measured in two piezometers located in the candín valley in the proximity of mosquitera fig 4 the boreholes have total depths of 20 m p1 and 40 m p2 and are excavated in the unaltered massif without reaching the mine workings yearly head fluctuations in these piezometers are low fig 3c and show no apparent direct hydraulic connection with the mine workings due to this scarcity of data the objectives of the numerical models are first to develop a methodological approach to integrate the mining geometry in the numerical simulator able to simulate the main processes in the system and second to improve through evaluation and simulation of likely scenarios the understanding on the groundwater dynamics both in the mine and in the massif the final objective is to provide information of principal flows and pathways velocities flow regime and risk scenarios for a later extension and application to contaminant transport models which will be the next stage in the post closure study 4 2 implementation of geometry and numerical model to include all the available information of pumarabule mosquitera in a numerical model is neither realistic nor achievable in terms of the computational power available in the research group even more if transient or transport models were to be run in the future to produce useful models the main features of the elements in the mine have been conceptualized and simplified in a way that aims to maintain the characteristics and influence in the process to be modeled the steps taken to translate mine plans into the model were the following 1 coal seams were grouped according to relative positions thickness and continuity of the layers the representative coal seam of each group is taken as reference and a code is assigned 2 underground galleries are geometrically simplified reducing segments and grouping those within each coal seam group this stage is conducted using cad software checking for joining errors that would lead to problems in the numerical calculations 3 coal seams in form of planar surfaces between galleries of different levels are drawn using information from the mine and coal seam plans if available and 4 the geometry of the mine is then imported from the cad software into the numerical simulator and embedded in the volume representing the massif constructed using the topography and geological information the physically based numerical model is built using the finite element commercial code comsol multiphysics a coupled continuum pipe flow ccpf model e g liedl et al 2003 was developed using the capabilities of the equation based pde partial derivative equations interface following a conceptualization of the system like the one proposed by adams and younger 2001 where mine workings are modeled as a discrete network of conduits embedded in a darcian surrounding medium the massif is modeled using darcy s law for flow in porous media 1 q k h m q l t 1 is the specific discharge or darcy velocity h m l is the hydraulic head at the massif and k l t 1 is the hydraulic conductivity in the exploitation zones panels defined as two dimensional planes the above expression is integrated with the thickness of the panel mine galleries are modeled as discrete 1d elements using the hagen poiseuille equation 2 q π d 4 ρ g 128 μ δ h c l q l3 t 1 is the volumetric flow rate in the conduit d l is the pipe diameter ρ m l 3 is the water density μ m l 1 t 1 the dynamic viscosity g l t 2 is gravity acceleration h c l is the head in the conduit and l l its length both models are coupled in the contact between the discrete features mine workings and the massif using an exchange term for example cao et al 2011 3 n α ex h c h m α ex l2 t 1 is the exchange coefficient and h c l and h m l the heads at the conduit and the massif respectively the exchange coefficient is computed with conduit diameter and a representative hydraulic conductivity hydraulic parameters have been assigned according to mine information for galleries and shafts section and exploitation zones thickness and estimated porosity derived from mining method and filling material as explained in section 3 the numerical models have been defined using a point constant head of 235 masl in mosquitera 1 and pumarabule shafts and the boundary conditions defined in section 3 3 the boundary conditions in the shafts allow for calculation of the pumping rates necessary to keep the water below the security level a constant recharge is implemented on the ground surface with homogeneous distribution the candín river is implemented using a mixed boundary condition with the form of equation 3 computed with the differences between the river levels and massif head and an estimated conductance the final geometry shown in fig 5 was meshed with a total of 877 746 nodes the numerical models were run assuming steady state conditions to solve the stationary model it has been utilized an iterative generalized minimal residual method gmres solver with a multigrid preconditioner total computational time using a standard desktop computer with a processor intel core i7 2600 cpu and 16 gb ram is less than 2 min for a steady state model because scarce data which makes it more difficult to proceed with an appropriate calibration of the model an exploratory strategy based on extensive multi parametric runs has allowed to explore possible scenarios the objective is to explore the effect of variations in the main parameters of the model shown in table 1 including hydraulic conductivities in the altered and unaltered massif recharge values conduit section variations such as caused by convergence or collapse of the mine voids hydraulic conductivity and thickness of exploitation zones panels and river conductance 5 results and discussion 450 model runs of the model in steady state conditions with parametric variations monte carlo analysis were computed from them a total of 441 were solved and considered in the analysis of the results presented below while 9 models did not reach convergence as a first measure for quality control net balance was computed using the expression r n q r is the total recharge at the top layer n is the total integrated flow rate between the porous media and the mine and q is the pumped water in the shafts as the models are in steady state and no other inflows outflows exist in the model the resulting balance must be zero plus ins outs from to the river the mean balance error in all the 441 models was 0 167 among them 20 models showed errors higher than 1 and only 2 above 5 fig 6 shows some of the relevant results of accepted models for variations in hydraulic conductivities for unaltered and altered massif and recharge results are compared with piezometric heads measured at the two piezometers in the proximities of mosquitera mines in which mean values were calculated from annual data p1 258 9 m and p2 256 4 m variations through the year in both piezometers are lower than 2 m the results show a strong dependence on the values of hydraulic conductivity in the unaltered massif and measured head in both piezometers the best correspondence was found for hydraulic conductivity values of 7 9 10 8 m s 1 which agree with the values provided by other authors that ranged between 3 10 8 m s 1 and 1 10 7 m s 1 ordóñez et al 2010 igme 2011 fig 6 also shows calculated annual pumped volume to keep the security level below 235 masl recharge values as expected show a strong correlation with total pumped discharged the results indicate that initial estimations 105 110 mm a 1 see section 3 3 would be on the upper range of validity and be acceptable for a year of high precipitation annual discharges around 2 5 hm3 the lower estimated infiltration might be result of the drain effects and the prevention of infiltration in the main system caused by ancient mines many from the xix century in the mountainsides which capture a fraction of infiltrated water at higher elevations that later outflows at old adits the altered massif because of its high hydraulic conductivity which agrees with values proposed for the altered zone shows no high influence neither in the piezometers nor in the pumped discharge for steady state models this is shown in the distribution of heads in the model fig 7 shows a general plain view of hydraulic heads at 50 masl above 3rd floor of mosquitera and pumarabule mines in one of the accepted models flow directions in the mine voids are shown with red arrows heading to the mosquitera 1 shaft where the main pumping facility is located the influence of the mine is shown in the depression of hydraulic heads near the workings as pressure head variations are more easily transmitted through the open voids and in the altered massif a further general objective is to implement a contaminant transport model to assess the environmental risks related to the closure of the mine as open voids constitute the preferential pathways for transported species and suspended solids groundwater velocities and flow regime in the mine voids have been evaluated to estimate the possible residence times of contaminant species in the galleries fig 8 shows example results of calculated dimensionless reynolds numbers that characterize the flow regime in the open voids for the reference model turbulent regimes are more likely to occur in the shafts the end of long transverses and the communication galleries between both mines the latter is important when pumping is only active in mosquitera as all the water from pumarabule is redirected to the nearby mine through the only four connections located at the 2nd 4th 7th and 8th floors results indicate that further research is necessary to study the effect of turbulent flows especially to study water circulation in the shafts where some flooded mines in the area are or will be utilized for geothermal energy use díaz noriega 2017 the calculated velocities have a large variability depending on the location in secondary and poorly connected galleries located far from the main shaft and transverses velocities are very low ranging from 10 3 to 10 1 m d 1 these velocities increase near main transverses up to values of 1 m d 1 0 1 l s 1 for a gallery with cross section of 9 m2 in the four documented direct underground connections between pumarabule and mosquitera there have been calculated velocities of 50 100 m d 1 and up to 125 m d 1 for scenarios where the only pumping is produced in mosquitera as it is in the normal set up in the transverses that collect the water from the galleries and communicate with the shafts velocities range from values of 10 m d 1 far from the discharging points to maximums of 300 500 m d 1 near the shaft in the shaft maximum velocities have been computed near the pumping facilities ranging between 500 and 800 m d 1 a summary of calculated velocities and a representative view is shown in fig 9 calculated velocities agree with the lower range of velocities from tracer tests and measurements from other authors e g wolkersdorfer 2005 2008 however caution must be taken on using these calculated values as reference figures because although obtained from exploration from a broad variety of conditions and parameter ranges stationary models and average rates are used using intermittent pumping rates with short term increase and after heavy rainfall periods higher velocities might be expected candín river has been included to analyse and evaluate the possibility of water loss from the river to the mine or discharge from the mine to the river a potential zone of river loss has been identified on a stretch where the river flows above the mine workings in green in fig 10 the calculated percentage of the total water infiltrated from the river is very small approx 3 compared with the total pumped in mosquitera from that 3 around 1 has been computed that would discharges back to the river at the southwest of the study area in red in fig 10 the river flows above the workings and subsidence on nearby areas have been detected however no inflows from the river into the mine workings have been detected the identification of infiltration from the river in the mines will require further investigation including differential gauging in the river the capacity of pumping facilities to remove the necessary volumes has proven satisfactory until now however the potential risk of sudden water discharges to the surface that would have negative environmental impacts because of the presence of associated chemical species have been recognized and evaluated a potential area of discharge has been identified after modeling in the valley of candín river fig 11 southbound of mosquitera 2 which is the topographically lower zone below 240 masl fig 11 shows a distribution of calculated heads in the massif for the set of models run heads above overflow elevation of the mine shaft entrance were computed in less than 10 of the models however it has been identified that more than 50 of models show elevations above 240 masl the lower topographic point at the southwest of the model 6 conclusions this paper has shown a strategy to conceptualize a complex underground mine system and to develop a numerically efficient water flow model using a finite element commercial software we have adapted a continuum and coupled conduit porous media formulation that has proved to be very satisfactory in term of computational times and mass balances this strategy allowed hundreds of models to be explored using monte carlo methods that allowed to identify and assess the sensitivity of the solutions to variations in the hydraulic parameters the results obtained provided an improvement in the understanding of groundwater flow in an underground mine system in the asturian coal basin hydraulic parameters of the massif have been estimated and agree with previous studies in the area in the mine voids it has been computed that water velocities can range from less than 0 001 m d 1 in secondary galleries far from the discharge points to hundreds of m d 1 near the shafts these velocities provide reference to evaluate the flow regime to assess the applicability of physical laws such as laminar flow approach in some zones of the mine and to develop further efficient formulations adaptable to these systems the models also constitute the base for later extension to more complex transient water rebound and transport models finally this work has shown that groundwater flow numerical models of very complex coal mine systems are feasible with up to date computational tools but require detailed mine information a proper previous analysis of the data and an adequate strategy of conceptualization of the elements and processes under study the definition of the conceptual model is a critical stage and should be explored in future models in the asturian central basin where other mines are under closure and at different flooding stages which strongly may affect regional groundwater gradients as so the presented methodology can be easily adapted to these mines especially because the geological framework exploitation methods and geometrical characteristics are very similar and expanded to include transport models for other applications such as to study their geothermal potential also type and origin of information is analogous in formats and datasets as all the mines in the area have been under operation by the same company in this sense the construction of a regional numerical model and a complete centralized database of all the mines in the asturian coal region should be a medium term objective with great utility for stakeholders

6136,secure workings in underground coal mines usually require the lowering of water levels via pumping after mine closure pump systems are stopped and the water level recovers in a process known as groundwater rebound in the asturian coal basin spain the closure and flooding of underground coal mines carries associated environmental impacts that ought to be assessed among them those related with groundwater flow and pollutant transport are of main interest to evaluate the environmental risks during and after mine closure the construction of numerical flow models is suggested which rely on an appropriate conceptualization of the mine hydrogeological system underground mines of this region are characterized by very steep coal seams due to a folded and faulted geological structure the resulting geometry translates into a complex network of hundreds of kilometers of mine tunnels and galleries this is a challenge for the construction of numerical models in issues like geometrical problems assignation of hydraulic parameters coupling of physical laws and high computational cost this paper presents the conceptual and numerical model of two linked mines of the region mosquitera and pumarabule that recently ended the flooding stage to be used in assessment of post closure environmental risks to implement the geometry of the underground mine a methodological approach to translate the mining information to the numerical simulator has been developed that retains the hydraulic behavior of the key underground mine elements a methodological approach for coupled simulation of mine conduits and porous media flow has been explicitly adapted the results in terms of the velocity distribution field inside the mine and possible outflow sites are useful to provide a basis for later extension of transport models and assessment of hydro chemical impacts on the area keywords mine closure underground coal mining asturian coal basin environmental risks conceptual model numerical modeling 1 introduction managing of environmental risks during and after coal mine closure is an important matter of concern in a scenario in which many exploitations have closed or will do soon in europe didier 2009 klinger et al 2011 bondaruk et al 2013 younger 2016 such is the case of numerous mines in asturias spain moreno and lópez 2008 jardón et al 2013 within this context it has been urged by the european commission 2013 to undertake actions to mitigate the negative environmental impacts of the european raw materials sector recently krzemień et al 2016 proposed a methodology for environmental risk management with the objective of achieving a sustainable mine closure and within this framework a fundamental stage is the evaluation of water related risks klinger et al 2012 a well known strategy within the hydrogeological community to evaluate and predict water related impacts is the construction of groundwater flow and transport numerical models e g anderson et al 2015 computational models include relevant information related to hydrological parameters and detailed geometry to solve the governing equations of the processes occurring in the system the outcomes in terms of distribution of state variables over time and space are useful to provide estimations e g of pollutants and discharges or take actions to avoid water related environmental impacts modeling groundwater flow in underground mine systems is a difficult task due to the complexity of simulating water flow processes in the mine voids that differ from those encountered in classical porous aquifers where darcy s laminar flow law is applicable wolkersdorfer 2008 however flow through the aquifers in which the mine is embedded should not be disregarded as happens with some processes like recharge e g ordóñez et al 2012 a strategy that combines both flow regimes is therefore needed that assures mass continuity this should be done in a computationally efficient way to support further developments such as transport of contaminants or heat for geothermal applications previous works have undertaken the simulation of water flow in underground mines the modelling solutions adopted vary but can be classified in two main groups a semi distributed box type and b physically based models box type models have been satisfactorily utilized in water rebound studies that is to predict the flooding after mine closure these models use the concept of interconnected ponds where the water budget is computed younger 2002 some examples are gram sherwood and younger 1997 or mifim banks 2001 physically based models usually take advantage of existing groundwater numerical codes such as the vss net component of shetran ewen et al 2000 which was added in order to simulate turbulent flow in mine studies adams and younger 2001 or the well known modflow harbaugh 2005 and feflow diersch 2013 the modelling of underground mine reservoirs especially in the asturian basin is a complex task derived from the intricate geometry and layout of the underground voids that are embedded into and should be hydraulically coupled to the porous media for example the steep coal panels linked by galleries at different levels would be extremely difficult or almost impossible to accommodate using finite difference codes with prismatic elements such as modflow additionally the hundreds of kilometres of galleries are not feasible to be implemented as three dimensional elements and the hundreds of interconnected branches would cause numerical instabilities in the calculation of water flow in the conduits this work presents the conceptual and numerical groundwater flow model of the flooded underground coal mine reservoir of mosquitera and pumarabule in asturias northern spain as a novelty a methodological approach to incorporate mining information into a groundwater model that addresses some peculiarities found in the asturian coal region derived from the characteristic geological settings is explained the results provide information about groundwater flow and distribution of pressures in the mine and in the surrounding massif water velocities and flow regimes in the mine conduits and risks of groundwater flooding after mine water rebound and discharge of contaminated mine waters the model constitutes the basis for further studies encompassing water rebound reactive transport and geothermal models 2 background and site description 2 1 coal mining in asturias first testimonials of coal exploitation in asturias spain come from the second half of 18th century in the 19th century starts a more intensive and industrialized stage of activities due to a flourishing metallurgic industry anes and ojeda 1983 asturian mines have been characterized by difficulties of extracting coal due to the very complex geological settings commonly with existence of very steep coal seams of low thickness and limited spatial continuity highly fractured requiring very intensive manpower in 1967 the national company hunosa hulleras del norte sa was established with the objective to cluster all the mines and exploitation of the asturian carboniferous central coal region including those not making profits in the 1990s underground coal mines started to close in asturias a process within an industrial reconversion that led to closure of all non profitable mines in the region by the end of 2018 european commission 2010 2 2 geological and hydrogeological settings 2 2 1 structure the carboniferous central asturian coal basin ccb lies in the center of the principality of asturias with a total area of approx 1400 km2 see fig 1 from a geological point of view it belongs to the cantabrian zone of the iberian massif julivert 1971 the geological limits of the ccb are the mesozoic tertiary basin to the north the ponga nappe regions to the east the leon fault to the south and the aramo unit whose limit is the aramo thrust to the west the zone of study is placed at the north of the central coal basin on a highly folded and faulted area the main structures respond to the historical variscan and alpine main stresses with directions west east and north south fuente alonso and sáenz de santa maría benedict 1999 the mines of mosquitera and pumarabule are located to the eastern flank of the sama syncline see fig 1 this syncline fold has a hinge line direction approx n s and plunges smoothly to the south the axial surface dips to the east with an angle of around 70 to the east of the sama syncline two other folds have importance in the underground distribution of the mine exploitation areas the magdalena anticline is a tight fold with axial surface dipping to the east as well as el entrego syncline both with axis direction n s the general structure in a w e cross section is shown in fig 1 two main families of faults which approximately follow the same directions of the folding structures e w and n s are observed in the area the most important have n s or nne ssw direction remarkable in this group is la carrera fault a reverse fault not well known because it is developed in clay non productive materials fuente alonso and sáenz de santa maría benedict 1999 the second fault system is approximately orthogonal to the main one but are generally minor structures with less continuity the delineation of these faults is in many cases only possible through underground information and is revealed by changes in the position of the coal seams 2 2 2 stratigraphy the coal bearing sequence of the basin has been divided into two main units fig 2 a a lower unproductive unit called lena group westphalian a c 3500 m of deltaic and marine sediments mainly composed by limestones with sporadic thin and discontinuous coal seams mostly in its upper part and b an upper productive unit called sama group westphalian d that has a thickness of more than 2000 m and contains exploitable coal seams within an important sandy sequence with sporadic limestones within each unit a grouping was done into smaller entities called packs adaro 1926 garcía loygorri et al 1971 an informal mining term utilized to identify in the sequence the position of the exploitable coal seams in the area fig 2 only coal seams from the sama group were exploited in the mines of mosquitera and pumarabule the most recent in the stratigraphic sequence were those from the sorriego mining pack in mosquitera and the oldest from the generalas mining pack see figs 1 and 2 2 2 3 hydrogeological properties the hydrogeological properties of the carboniferous materials in the area are generally poor in terms of permeability and storage properties previous authors ordóñez et al 2012 álvarez et al 2016 have classified them into three hydrogeological groups a shales and siltstones with very low hydraulic conductivities of 10 7 10 8 m s 1 b carboniferous sandstones and conglomerates which show conductivities of around 10 6 m s 1 c carboniferous limestones and dolostones whose permeability vary according to the extent of the karstification these materials may have changed their natural properties in exploited zones according to the stresses extension and compression caused by the mine works see for example younger and adams 1999 2 3 mosquitera pumarabule mines 2 3 1 general characteristics the mine system under study includes the mines of pumarabule 1 and 2 mosquitera 1 mosquitera 2 and rosellón see shaft locations in fig 1 in total the underground workings extend over an area of more than 20 km2 and reach a depth of almost 600 m below the ground surface the first shaft of the pumarabule mine marta or pumarabule 1 was excavated in 1916 and operations began in 1917 the second shaft pumarabule 2 was excavated in 1957 less than 40 m away from the first shaft pumarabule 1 has a total depth of 242 m and pumarabule 2 reaches a depth of 578 m 292 masl pumarabule underground workings are distributed in 13 levels or floors with main transverse roadways of w e direction the main transverses connect the shaft with the galleries that allowed access to the exploitation areas and are approximately aligned with the strike direction n s of the coal layers the galleries extend to the north of transverses with a length between 400 and 800 m to the south the galleries reach further with lengths up to 1500 m in the exploitation zones coal panels of high dips around 70 were exploited using manual methods with backfilling mosquitera 1 was concluded in 1929 and mosquitera 2 started its production in 1946 mosquitera 1 has a maximum depth of 566 m 296 masl and mosquitera 2 reaches a maximum depth of 477 m 204 masl in december 1989 a fire in the 7th level of mosquitera 1 caused the death of seven miners and the shaft was closed from that date pumarabule was used to continue the exploitation of coal until its closure in 2005 the underground distribution of mosquitera s mine workings is more complex than that of pumarabule s instead of a unique main transverse roadway per level in mosquitera there is one main transverse per shaft the main transverses of mosquitera 1 are longer than 2 km the shafts allow access to different underground levels 11 in mosquitera 1 and 7 in mosquitera 2 pumarabule and mosquitera mines are connected at 2nd 4th 7th and 8th floors this proprietary information gathered from different sources mainly data provided by the mining company hunosa historical records in the regional mining archives and the spanish geological survey igme and processed by the authors is fundamental to build the modelling geometry 2 3 2 water discharge and rebound in pumarabule mosquitera with the deepening of the underground workings to extract coal water pumping keeps areas dry and secure the depressed water level is later reverted after closure of the mine but the natural system has by then been largely affected and modified by the anthropic activity historical data for the pumarabule exploitation shows that for each ton of coal extracted between 15 and 25 tons of water was pumped for example in the period 1995 2001 the total production of coal was 8 105 t tonnes in the selected mines 1 85 0 2 t of raw materials to obtain 1 t of coal after washing and the water extracted in the same period was 1 6 107 m3 this is 2 1 105 t a 1 of raw material extracted and 2 3 106 m3 a 1 water pumped a factor of approximately 11 1 of water to raw material which is in the middle range of other coalfields in europe and in the world see fig 29 in wolkersdorfer 2008 residence times have not been estimated but previous studies e g jardón 2010 suggest delay times between 15 and 45 days since water is infiltrated until it is pumped out of the shafts extraction of coal in pumarabule mosquitera ended in 2004 dewatering pumps were stopped the 26th of october 2010 natural flooding of the mine occurred until a previously defined security level of 230 masl was reached in december 2014 it is a water elevation defined by the mining company to avoid unwanted discharges of contaminated mine water to the surface this level is maintained using five pumps three located in mosquitera 1 and two in pumarabule each one with a theoretical pumping capacity of 225 240 m3 h 1 by april 2016 after permission the company let the level risen to the current 235 masl fig 3 shows historical data of monthly pumping rates in both mines and the water rebound curve for the mosquitera mine pumarabule rebound curve is not shown as it perfectly matches mosquitera levels confirming the very good hydraulic connection between the two mines monthly water pumped in both shafts is shown in fig 3a the main pumping station is located in mosquitera 1 whereas additional pumps in pumarabule are utilized as backup for high rain periods pumping rate in mosquitera is higher during the wet season usually between november and may which shows the relation with precipitation patterns with highest pumping accumulated values of 0 2 0 3 hm3 month 1 all this information shows the structure of the geometry and dynamic relationships among the interlinked shafts 3 conceptual model development 3 1 objectives the groundwater model presented in this work aims to provide insights about water flow dynamics in the reservoir after the mines have been flooded and the pumps are reactivated to maintain the security level the objectives of the numerical groundwater model are to analyze the hydrodynamic characteristics e g water velocity in the galleries flow regime discharge volumes in different scenarios to provide a context for evaluation and further extension to include contaminant transport models that constitute the basis for environmental risk assessment after mine closure to proceed with the numerical evaluation it is necessary to define first the conceptual model which includes all what is known and relevant about the system and can be defined as an assembly of simplifications about a complex real system which achieves a valid representation of that system including all major features whilst avoiding unnecessary detail younger and adams 1999 3 2 general assumptions mine workings act as preferential pathways for groundwater akin to that of a karst aquifer wolkersdorfer 2008 the hydraulic properties of the geological medium surrounding the mine are also modified to an extent as consequence of the mining activity showing a higher increasing of permeability and porosity near the voids e g younger and adams 1999 the general flow behavior of the system can be conceptualized as a connected network of mine voids of different dimensionality that act as a large drainage system embedded in a massif partially altered after mining the main recharge is caused by rain the water that infiltrates through the porous media aquifer flow through the massif until percolates into the mine voids water is then conducted to discharge points located in the shafts where pumping is active to maintain a fixed security level 3 3 model extension and definition of boundary conditions the conceptual model has been given an extent of approximately 25 5 km2 fig 4 the limits have been defined using the geological information that assigns a very low permeability of the existent unaltered massifs that separates the studied mines from nearby workings to the east a no flow boundary is represented by the tendeyón mining pack fig 2 a thick sequence of shale materials of more than 500 m considered impervious the same formation provides the no flow boundary at the bottom of the model following the syncline structure at depths ranging between 2000 and 3000 m the northwest boundary is represented by la carrera fault a reverse fault or thrust not well known but considered impervious because it is developed in clay non productive materials fuente alonso and sáenz de santa maría benedict 1999 two closed mines are located further to the north of the study area toral aramil and at a larger distance a more important one named lieres fig 4 to the south a large mined zone exists with two closed mines candín sw and venturo se an unaltered protection massif acts as a separation boundary with all these exploitations analysis of historical records of pumping rates from these mines show no apparent connection and therefore it is assumed that no flow occurs between these mines and the reservoir under study the upper surface boundary is defined with detailed topography of the area recharge has been estimated using precipitation data from oviedo meteorological station located about 15 km from the study area and works from previous authors who estimated infiltration values for aquifers on the area of 104 álvarez et al 2016 and 110 mm year 1 muñoz de fraga 2015 these values represent around 22 26 of the average effective rainfall estimated in 450 mm year 1 by álvarez et al 2016 for the area of candín just southwest of the study area fig 1 finally the candín river see fig 1 the main river in the area is represented in the model as a line segment in the valley the main dewatering points of the system are the pumps located in the mine shafts these pumping facilities aim to keep the water level below the security height of 235 masl and are intermittently active when water level raises above the predefined level with higher pumping rates during wet season total annual pumping rates have ranged before flooding between 1 4 and 2 6 hm3 year 1 with a mean value of 2 091 hm3 year 1 fig 3b after flooding in 2015 the annual discharged volume was 2 06 hm3 in mosquitera supported by pumping of 0 5 hm3 in pumarabule that is 2 56 hm3 in total while in 2016 the total pumped was much lower 1 23 hm3 but the pumps stopped for some months to let the level rise from 230 to the current 235 masl fig 3 shows monthly pumping rates in mosquitera blue and pumarabule red 3 4 conceptualization of mine elements affecting groundwater flow mine voids including galleries roadways access works and shafts constitute the main pathways for rapid water flow in the model the large system of underground tunnels is there conceptualized as a large interconnected pipe system that conducts water to the discharge points in this case the pump systems located in the shafts galleries in asturian mines have an average cross section of 9 m2 although values range from those of less important secondary galleries sections of 6 m2 were identified in old mine plans to main roadways and landing areas located near the shaft which have sections of 20 m2 convergence due to overburden has been estimated to cause a reduction in section of galleries of about 5 10 ordóñez et al 2012 the average cross section of shafts is bigger and depends on the diameter of each shaft ranging between 4 3 m and 5 65 m exploitation zones coal panels suffer a transformation of their characteristics once coal has been extracted hydraulic properties vary depending on the method of exploitation compaction and subsidence reduce the original net volume once the exploitation is abandoned as coarse practical approximation values of porosity of 20 can be employed for filled exploitation zones and of 30 for collapsed ones jardón 2010 in compacted backfill material porosity can be reduced to less than 10 whereas collapsed sandstone can show porosities of 40 ordóñez et al 2010 in the study area values lower than 20 have been chosen after having analyzed exploitation methods for the altered massif the values of hydraulic conductivity are based on previous works in the area díaz noriega 2017 and values estimated in the literature e g younger and adams 1999 younger 2011 the unaltered massif is considered to have very low permeability with hydraulic conductivity values generally lower than 10 7m s 1 reaching 5 10 6 m s 1 in fractured zones álvarez et al 2016 a summary of values utilized are shown in table 1 4 groundwater numerical model development 4 1 modeling objectives available data are very scarce the only available information are water levels measured in the shafts monthly discharge rates necessary to keep levels at the 235 masl security height and piezometric heads measured in two piezometers located in the candín valley in the proximity of mosquitera fig 4 the boreholes have total depths of 20 m p1 and 40 m p2 and are excavated in the unaltered massif without reaching the mine workings yearly head fluctuations in these piezometers are low fig 3c and show no apparent direct hydraulic connection with the mine workings due to this scarcity of data the objectives of the numerical models are first to develop a methodological approach to integrate the mining geometry in the numerical simulator able to simulate the main processes in the system and second to improve through evaluation and simulation of likely scenarios the understanding on the groundwater dynamics both in the mine and in the massif the final objective is to provide information of principal flows and pathways velocities flow regime and risk scenarios for a later extension and application to contaminant transport models which will be the next stage in the post closure study 4 2 implementation of geometry and numerical model to include all the available information of pumarabule mosquitera in a numerical model is neither realistic nor achievable in terms of the computational power available in the research group even more if transient or transport models were to be run in the future to produce useful models the main features of the elements in the mine have been conceptualized and simplified in a way that aims to maintain the characteristics and influence in the process to be modeled the steps taken to translate mine plans into the model were the following 1 coal seams were grouped according to relative positions thickness and continuity of the layers the representative coal seam of each group is taken as reference and a code is assigned 2 underground galleries are geometrically simplified reducing segments and grouping those within each coal seam group this stage is conducted using cad software checking for joining errors that would lead to problems in the numerical calculations 3 coal seams in form of planar surfaces between galleries of different levels are drawn using information from the mine and coal seam plans if available and 4 the geometry of the mine is then imported from the cad software into the numerical simulator and embedded in the volume representing the massif constructed using the topography and geological information the physically based numerical model is built using the finite element commercial code comsol multiphysics a coupled continuum pipe flow ccpf model e g liedl et al 2003 was developed using the capabilities of the equation based pde partial derivative equations interface following a conceptualization of the system like the one proposed by adams and younger 2001 where mine workings are modeled as a discrete network of conduits embedded in a darcian surrounding medium the massif is modeled using darcy s law for flow in porous media 1 q k h m q l t 1 is the specific discharge or darcy velocity h m l is the hydraulic head at the massif and k l t 1 is the hydraulic conductivity in the exploitation zones panels defined as two dimensional planes the above expression is integrated with the thickness of the panel mine galleries are modeled as discrete 1d elements using the hagen poiseuille equation 2 q π d 4 ρ g 128 μ δ h c l q l3 t 1 is the volumetric flow rate in the conduit d l is the pipe diameter ρ m l 3 is the water density μ m l 1 t 1 the dynamic viscosity g l t 2 is gravity acceleration h c l is the head in the conduit and l l its length both models are coupled in the contact between the discrete features mine workings and the massif using an exchange term for example cao et al 2011 3 n α ex h c h m α ex l2 t 1 is the exchange coefficient and h c l and h m l the heads at the conduit and the massif respectively the exchange coefficient is computed with conduit diameter and a representative hydraulic conductivity hydraulic parameters have been assigned according to mine information for galleries and shafts section and exploitation zones thickness and estimated porosity derived from mining method and filling material as explained in section 3 the numerical models have been defined using a point constant head of 235 masl in mosquitera 1 and pumarabule shafts and the boundary conditions defined in section 3 3 the boundary conditions in the shafts allow for calculation of the pumping rates necessary to keep the water below the security level a constant recharge is implemented on the ground surface with homogeneous distribution the candín river is implemented using a mixed boundary condition with the form of equation 3 computed with the differences between the river levels and massif head and an estimated conductance the final geometry shown in fig 5 was meshed with a total of 877 746 nodes the numerical models were run assuming steady state conditions to solve the stationary model it has been utilized an iterative generalized minimal residual method gmres solver with a multigrid preconditioner total computational time using a standard desktop computer with a processor intel core i7 2600 cpu and 16 gb ram is less than 2 min for a steady state model because scarce data which makes it more difficult to proceed with an appropriate calibration of the model an exploratory strategy based on extensive multi parametric runs has allowed to explore possible scenarios the objective is to explore the effect of variations in the main parameters of the model shown in table 1 including hydraulic conductivities in the altered and unaltered massif recharge values conduit section variations such as caused by convergence or collapse of the mine voids hydraulic conductivity and thickness of exploitation zones panels and river conductance 5 results and discussion 450 model runs of the model in steady state conditions with parametric variations monte carlo analysis were computed from them a total of 441 were solved and considered in the analysis of the results presented below while 9 models did not reach convergence as a first measure for quality control net balance was computed using the expression r n q r is the total recharge at the top layer n is the total integrated flow rate between the porous media and the mine and q is the pumped water in the shafts as the models are in steady state and no other inflows outflows exist in the model the resulting balance must be zero plus ins outs from to the river the mean balance error in all the 441 models was 0 167 among them 20 models showed errors higher than 1 and only 2 above 5 fig 6 shows some of the relevant results of accepted models for variations in hydraulic conductivities for unaltered and altered massif and recharge results are compared with piezometric heads measured at the two piezometers in the proximities of mosquitera mines in which mean values were calculated from annual data p1 258 9 m and p2 256 4 m variations through the year in both piezometers are lower than 2 m the results show a strong dependence on the values of hydraulic conductivity in the unaltered massif and measured head in both piezometers the best correspondence was found for hydraulic conductivity values of 7 9 10 8 m s 1 which agree with the values provided by other authors that ranged between 3 10 8 m s 1 and 1 10 7 m s 1 ordóñez et al 2010 igme 2011 fig 6 also shows calculated annual pumped volume to keep the security level below 235 masl recharge values as expected show a strong correlation with total pumped discharged the results indicate that initial estimations 105 110 mm a 1 see section 3 3 would be on the upper range of validity and be acceptable for a year of high precipitation annual discharges around 2 5 hm3 the lower estimated infiltration might be result of the drain effects and the prevention of infiltration in the main system caused by ancient mines many from the xix century in the mountainsides which capture a fraction of infiltrated water at higher elevations that later outflows at old adits the altered massif because of its high hydraulic conductivity which agrees with values proposed for the altered zone shows no high influence neither in the piezometers nor in the pumped discharge for steady state models this is shown in the distribution of heads in the model fig 7 shows a general plain view of hydraulic heads at 50 masl above 3rd floor of mosquitera and pumarabule mines in one of the accepted models flow directions in the mine voids are shown with red arrows heading to the mosquitera 1 shaft where the main pumping facility is located the influence of the mine is shown in the depression of hydraulic heads near the workings as pressure head variations are more easily transmitted through the open voids and in the altered massif a further general objective is to implement a contaminant transport model to assess the environmental risks related to the closure of the mine as open voids constitute the preferential pathways for transported species and suspended solids groundwater velocities and flow regime in the mine voids have been evaluated to estimate the possible residence times of contaminant species in the galleries fig 8 shows example results of calculated dimensionless reynolds numbers that characterize the flow regime in the open voids for the reference model turbulent regimes are more likely to occur in the shafts the end of long transverses and the communication galleries between both mines the latter is important when pumping is only active in mosquitera as all the water from pumarabule is redirected to the nearby mine through the only four connections located at the 2nd 4th 7th and 8th floors results indicate that further research is necessary to study the effect of turbulent flows especially to study water circulation in the shafts where some flooded mines in the area are or will be utilized for geothermal energy use díaz noriega 2017 the calculated velocities have a large variability depending on the location in secondary and poorly connected galleries located far from the main shaft and transverses velocities are very low ranging from 10 3 to 10 1 m d 1 these velocities increase near main transverses up to values of 1 m d 1 0 1 l s 1 for a gallery with cross section of 9 m2 in the four documented direct underground connections between pumarabule and mosquitera there have been calculated velocities of 50 100 m d 1 and up to 125 m d 1 for scenarios where the only pumping is produced in mosquitera as it is in the normal set up in the transverses that collect the water from the galleries and communicate with the shafts velocities range from values of 10 m d 1 far from the discharging points to maximums of 300 500 m d 1 near the shaft in the shaft maximum velocities have been computed near the pumping facilities ranging between 500 and 800 m d 1 a summary of calculated velocities and a representative view is shown in fig 9 calculated velocities agree with the lower range of velocities from tracer tests and measurements from other authors e g wolkersdorfer 2005 2008 however caution must be taken on using these calculated values as reference figures because although obtained from exploration from a broad variety of conditions and parameter ranges stationary models and average rates are used using intermittent pumping rates with short term increase and after heavy rainfall periods higher velocities might be expected candín river has been included to analyse and evaluate the possibility of water loss from the river to the mine or discharge from the mine to the river a potential zone of river loss has been identified on a stretch where the river flows above the mine workings in green in fig 10 the calculated percentage of the total water infiltrated from the river is very small approx 3 compared with the total pumped in mosquitera from that 3 around 1 has been computed that would discharges back to the river at the southwest of the study area in red in fig 10 the river flows above the workings and subsidence on nearby areas have been detected however no inflows from the river into the mine workings have been detected the identification of infiltration from the river in the mines will require further investigation including differential gauging in the river the capacity of pumping facilities to remove the necessary volumes has proven satisfactory until now however the potential risk of sudden water discharges to the surface that would have negative environmental impacts because of the presence of associated chemical species have been recognized and evaluated a potential area of discharge has been identified after modeling in the valley of candín river fig 11 southbound of mosquitera 2 which is the topographically lower zone below 240 masl fig 11 shows a distribution of calculated heads in the massif for the set of models run heads above overflow elevation of the mine shaft entrance were computed in less than 10 of the models however it has been identified that more than 50 of models show elevations above 240 masl the lower topographic point at the southwest of the model 6 conclusions this paper has shown a strategy to conceptualize a complex underground mine system and to develop a numerically efficient water flow model using a finite element commercial software we have adapted a continuum and coupled conduit porous media formulation that has proved to be very satisfactory in term of computational times and mass balances this strategy allowed hundreds of models to be explored using monte carlo methods that allowed to identify and assess the sensitivity of the solutions to variations in the hydraulic parameters the results obtained provided an improvement in the understanding of groundwater flow in an underground mine system in the asturian coal basin hydraulic parameters of the massif have been estimated and agree with previous studies in the area in the mine voids it has been computed that water velocities can range from less than 0 001 m d 1 in secondary galleries far from the discharge points to hundreds of m d 1 near the shafts these velocities provide reference to evaluate the flow regime to assess the applicability of physical laws such as laminar flow approach in some zones of the mine and to develop further efficient formulations adaptable to these systems the models also constitute the base for later extension to more complex transient water rebound and transport models finally this work has shown that groundwater flow numerical models of very complex coal mine systems are feasible with up to date computational tools but require detailed mine information a proper previous analysis of the data and an adequate strategy of conceptualization of the elements and processes under study the definition of the conceptual model is a critical stage and should be explored in future models in the asturian central basin where other mines are under closure and at different flooding stages which strongly may affect regional groundwater gradients as so the presented methodology can be easily adapted to these mines especially because the geological framework exploitation methods and geometrical characteristics are very similar and expanded to include transport models for other applications such as to study their geothermal potential also type and origin of information is analogous in formats and datasets as all the mines in the area have been under operation by the same company in this sense the construction of a regional numerical model and a complete centralized database of all the mines in the asturian coal region should be a medium term objective with great utility for stakeholders

6137,in sierra nevada southern spain the highest mountain range in southern europe the application of an ancestral integrated water resources management system iwrm based on the conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water provides water resources for irrigation and supply in the driest months of the year in this semiarid mountain region meltwater is derived from the headwaters of the mountain streams and rivers through a set of uncoated channels excavated in the ground locally known as acequias de careo to infiltrate at the upper part of the valleys water infiltrated along the acequias de careo slowly flows down the hillsides through the weathered zone of the hard rock aquifer and the glacial and periglacial sediments the recharge accomplished through this managed aquifer recharge technique mar activates numerous springs located halfway down the hillside and increases the base flow of the rivers in this study focused on a careo channel located on the southern slope of sierra nevada called acequia de el espino different archaeological sedimentological geophysical and hydrogeological techniques are applied to determine the age and the efficiency of this ancestral example of a mar and iwrm system results suggest that the acequias de careo may be the oldest mar system in europe and that this mar technique could be applied in other high mountain alpine watersheds to mitigate the effects of climate change keywords water resources management managed aquifer recharge alpine watershed hard rocks 1 introduction sierra nevada the highest mountain range of the iberian peninsula reaching 3479 m a s l is located less than 35 km far from the mediterranean sea the boundary between africa and europe fig 1 the substantial climate contrast between its high mountain conditions and the surrounding mediterranean semiarid climate favours the development of a complex and singular system from different perspectives weather hydrogeology ecology culture and ethnology in fact sierra nevada is the area featuring the greatest diversity and endemicity of the iberian peninsula blanca et al 1998 brewer et al 2002 granados and cano manuel 2015 and it has been recognized as a biosphere reserve by unesco 1986 and as a national park 1999 due to its altitude and orographic effects rainfall is higher than the average for the surrounding area and often occurs in the form of snow for these reasons runoff is essential for supplying resources for agriculture and tourism and for maintaining the environmental value of the associated ecosystems the sierra nevada foothills and the adjacent depressions have been colonized since palaeolithic and neolithic times by subsequent civilizations attracted by the abundance of water coming from the snow accumulated on its summits gómez ortiz et al 2013 close to sierra nevada there are several sites where irrigated agriculture was presumably practiced in the framework of the el argar and los millares cultures over 4000 years ago giráldez et al 1988 gilman and thornes 2014 irrigation techniques flourished in the middle ages during the spanish islamic period glick and kirchner 2000 roldán and moreno 2010 from the 8th century up to the conquest of granada by the christians in the late 15th century the arab culture left an outstanding imprint on the water management of all al ándalus the name of the vast territory of the iberian peninsula governed by the muslims glick and kirchner 2000 vivas et al 2009 water supply to large cities such as córdoba the most populous city of that time with more than one million inhabitants helped the muslims of al ándalus recover and even exceed the splendour of the roman empire roldán and moreno 2010 however their main advances were focused on irrigation from a technological point of view the islamic civilization made an extensive compilation and improvement of the irrigation techniques of the ancient world and obviously applied them widely in al ándalus roldán and moreno 2010 they constructed dykes and dams to derive water from rivers and ephemeral streams and extracted groundwater by means of qanats and wells kamash 2012 and water harvesting techniques the latter were used for thousands of years in northern africa and the arabian peninsula prinz 1996 water harvesting comprises the collection of runoff and its use for the irrigation of crops pastures and trees and for livestock consumption finkel and finkel 1986 indigenous systems then applied often still remain in use jessour and meskat in tunisia tabia in libya cisterns in northern egypt hafaer in jordan and syria or the hillsite conduit systems used in israel and north yemen prinz 1996 oweis and hachum 2006 the surficial water and the groundwater collected were subsequently distributed over growing areas through irrigation channels or canals roldán and moreno 2010 in sierra nevada water harvesting and groundwater use were combined and incorporated into an original and advanced integrated water resources management iwrm system based on the conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water indeed the muslims being experts in irrigated crops martín civantos 2011 made an outsized effort to develop innumerable cultivation terraces fig 2 a around the villages of sierra nevada martín civantos 2007 these orchards were flooded by means of irrigation channels acequias built and maintained by the community fig 2c yet the rivers and springs flow diminished in summer precisely when the water demand was greater for this reason the muslims established a water management system that consisted of deriving the meltwater from the headwaters of the mountain streams and rivers fig 2c and 2d and recharging it halfway down the hillside fig 2e and 2f through long uncoated channels excavated in the ground pulido bosch and sbih 1995 these channels are locally known as acequias de careo water infiltrated along the acequias de careo slowly flows downhill through the weathered zone of the hard rock aquifer during the dry season it arises through springs located halfway down the hillside and or through the rivers from which it was derived during the thaw increasing its base flow fig 3 in summer the acequias de careo are no longer used and another extensive network of irrigation channels located at a lower altitude begins to divert water from the rivers to the agricultural areas in sierra nevada there are more than 700 km of acequias de careo fig 1c most of them still working their existence at least since the middle ages has been historically documented martín civantos 2010 and it is known that most of these channels were already operative when the castillians conquered the territory toward the end of the middle ages delaigue 1995 our analysis is focused on a careo channel called acequia de el espino which is located in the bérchules river valley fig 4 on the southern slope of sierra nevada the aim of this study is to determine the age and the efficiency of this ancestral example of a mar and iwrm system to this end we used a multidisciplinary approach applying diverse archaeological sedimentological geophysical and hydrogeological techniques firstly we describe the hydrogeological features of the region and the operating mode of the acequias de careo mar system geophysical and sedimentological studies of the sedimentary infill associated with the preferential recharge areas allowed us to establish its geometry and its anthropic origin respectively subsequently an analysis of archive records and geochronological techniques osl led us to establish the workability of the system since at least the 11th century finally the present day infiltration capacity of the system was determined through continuous measurement of the flow recharged at the acequias de careo this multidisciplinary study demonstrates that the acequias de careo constitute the oldest mar system in europe 2 hydrogeological setting two main kinds of aquifer formations with clearly differentiated hydrogeological behaviour can be found in sierra nevada fig 1b 1 the shallowest part of the schists of the nevado filábride complex which crop out in the core of sierra nevada where the range reaches the highest elevation the weathered zone of these rocks together with the glacial and periglacial quaternary formations of the highest areas of the mountain form an extensive aquifer in hard rocks 1358 km2 and 2 the carbonate rocks of the alpujarride complex that partially surround the schists from the west and south of sierra nevada fig 1b metamorphic rocks of the nevado filábride complex mainly fine grained feldspathic graphite schists with quartzite intercalations crop out in nearly all the bérchules river basin fig 4b they show a very penetrative foliation with a general dip towards the n ne the weathered zone of metamorphic rocks constitutes a surficial aquifer of reduced thickness maximum depths of 30 50 m but very extensive since it practically covers the whole sierra nevada it comprises an upper part formed by weathered and disintegrated schists saprolite and a lower fissured and fractured zone saprock that extends in depth to the unaltered rock at elevations higher than 2500 m a s l low temperatures determine the predominance of physical weathering by crioclastic processes with the development of a crioclastic layer that occupies the entire summit area except for the most rugged zones in the highest areas the surficial aquifer is formed by debris deposits they are scree or talus deposits located at the foot of the escarpments or glacial sediments accumulated at the top of the highest valleys below 2500 m a s l the increase in temperature favours edaphization and chemical weathering processes which may lead to a decrease in permeability at the alteration zone owing to the presence of a greater clayey fraction the hydrogeological behaviour of this shallowest aquifer depends on the altitude in the upper parts of the study zone almost all the runoff infiltrates in the aquifer this is due to the high permeability of the existing talus deposits along with the low slope of the sierra nevada highlands in these zones infiltration is even enhanced by the high proportion of snowfall precipitation and its slow melting process moreover as altitude decreases mean precipitation drops and mean temperature rises and evapotranspiration is greater as the glacial and periglacial sediments disappear as a result the aquifer is mainly constituted by the surface weathered zone of the schists all these facts cause the natural aquifer recharge to noticeably decrease in the altitudinal range between 2000 and 1600 m a s l with respect to the highest areas of sierra nevada below 1600 m a s l which is the average altitude of the recharge channels ortiz moreno 2010 recharge increases again martos rosillo et al 2017 the limits of the studied aquifer coincide with those of the surface watershed of the bérchules river basin 67 6 km2 the bérchules river is a tributary of the guadalfeo river which flows into the mediterranean sea with an average altitude of 2072 m a s l and slope of 37 its highest point is cerro del gallo peak 2910 m a s l to the north and the lowpoint is at the narila gauging station 979 m a s l to the south the bérchules watershed contains an intricate network of irrigation channels and acequias de careo fig 4 used to 1 transfer water to neighbouring basins 2 recharge the surface aquifer and 3 irrigate crops there are 19 main channels giving a total length of 57 45 km 21 km of them being specifically acequias de careo the main recharge channels of the bérchules basin are the acequia de el espino 7 km and the acequia de trevélez 11 km until it enters the bérchules basin the latter acequia transfers water from the left bank of the trevélez river to the bérchules river basin where it is recharged in turn the acequia de mecina captures water from the grande river and carries it towards the mecina river basin located in the eastward neighbouring hydrological basin the acequia de el espino is therefore one of the recharge channels or acequia de careo that are still active in sierra nevada it is located in the bérchules river basin on the southern slope of the range fig 4 for the period 1970 2013 at the bérchules meteorological station 1319 m a s l the mean annual precipitation is 677 mm yr and the mean annual temperature is 13 3 c for the same period the average annual flowrate of the bérchules river at the gauging station fig 4 is 12 23 hm3 year showing a seasonal pluvio nival fluvial behaviour jódar et al 2017 2018 the soil cover fig 4a is mainly represented by sparse scrub crops conifers and grassland as well as by irrigated horticulture crops particularly in the lowlands but also in a reduced area in the uplands about 260 ha 4 of the total catchment surface area the limits of the aquifer generally coincide with those of the surface watershed of the bérchules river fig 4b in the period 1970 2013 the average recharge of the aquifer is 6 3 hm3 year though 3 1 hm3 year is interflow discharged through numerous springs sprouting on the river slopes martos rosillo et al 2015 therefore the rain infiltrated under edaphic soil and not drained through interflow is recharged in the aquifer and discharged in the bérchules river in addition there are 20 wells fig 4b with flows lower than 2 l s which are used as support for irrigation and supply to livestock hydrological models have made it possible to estimate the groundwater component of total runoff at the bérchules basin between 76 and 95 martos rosillo et al 2015 jódar et al 2017 2018 this large contribution of groundwater to the total basin runoff underlines the important role of aquifer recharge in the basin confirmed by studies involving environmental tracers barberá et al 2018 moreover the high inertial functioning of this river is a consequence of the managed aquifer recharge mar carried out through the acequias de careo martos rosillo et al 2017 3 the recharge channel of acequia de el espino the acequia de el espino is a channel excavated in metamorphic rocks it starts as a simple and small diversion dyke locally known as toma made of slabs of schists without mortar and arranged in the chico de bérchules river bed fig 2c and d at 1998 m a s l this dyke allows the diversion of water from the river towards the channel the average height slope and width of this channel are respectively 1905 m a s l 6 8 and 1 5 m two members of the irrigation community of bérchules fig 2c are in charge of the management and control of the diversion dyke including repairing the basin channel system and distributing the diverted water this is done following the same ancient practices of their ancestors transmitted from generation to generation the acequia de el espino ends in the sima de bérchules at 1820 m a s l and it does not present any derivation for irrigation purposes along its entire path however four main recharge zones fig 5 can be distinguished along the channel 1 sima de los helechales average elevation and area of 1888 m a s l and 4910 m2 respectively 2 sima del barranco de montina 1866 m a s l and 2117 m2 3 sima de márcula 1821 m a s l and 25901 m2 and finally 4 sima de bérchules 1820 m a s l and 32328 m2 which is the most important recharge zone and consists of a surface covered by grass whose substrate is characterized by its high infiltration capacity fig 2e and 2f in dry periods river water begins to be diverted in november december in years with rainfall equal to or greater than the average and with a large amount of snow accumulated in the upper part of the basin water is diverted later february march during the melting season april to june the river flowrate increases and so do water derivations through the channel this flowrate increase in the channel allows the diverted water to reach the sima de bérchules recharge area if the infiltration capacity of both the channel and the sima de bérchules is surpassed then the other three recharge zones located upstream i e sima de márcula sima barranco montina and sima de los helechales are put into operation using a simple water bypass system 4 methodology this study is based on the application of several archaeological sedimentological geophysical and hydrogeological procedures fig 6 summarizes them and the objectives related to each technique hydrogeological methods have been applied to determine the infiltration capacity of the acequias de careo and to define their operation method sedimentological and geophysical investigations have allowed us to establish the origin and geometry of the sedimentary infill associated with the main recharge zones finally the analysis of archive records and the application of geochronological techniques have allowed the determination of the age and the workability of the recharge system 4 1 historical and archaeological analysis the methodology applied is based on the notion that landscapes are the result of continuous modifications of several historical landscapes taking shape over time godelier 1984 landscape understood as a synthesis of social and environmental relations and taking into account its formation process can be decoded it is a set composed of stratified apprehensible and measurable elements bearing stratigraphic and contextual relationships this means that a given landscape can be known and understood diachronically from an archaeological perspective martín civantos 2006 2008 such is the basis of hydraulic archeology the starting point for a technical and spatial analysis of historical irrigation systems accordingly the study of hydraulic systems cannot be limited to a sum delineation of irrigated spaces or the simple observation of a close relationship between residence areas and their irrigated perimeters analysis must go deeper evaluating transformations of the irrigation space throughout its history with regard to social relationships and the environment barceló 1989 in this sense interdisciplinary approaches as the current one are essential to reach an integrated knowledge about such complex socio ecosystems in addition to the archaeological perspective a thorough knowledge of historical written sources and place names is fundamental in bérchules specific references are almost absent until the castillian conquest in 1492 the main available source of information is a document called libro de apeo y repartimiento lar 1573 lars record surveys and demarcations made in the 16th century by the christian authorities to register the existing assets in each village after the expulsion of the moorish population they served the crown for the reorganization of space as well as for obtaining tax revenue and contain geographic data agricultural production place names surnames crops number of houses mills etc 4 2 sedimentary infill analysis the recharge zones simas related to the acequia de el espino are surfaces covered with pasture and very sparse rocky outcrops consequently subsurface techniques shallow geophysical methods and coring are the main tools used to characterize the geometry and nature of the sedimentary infill 4 2 1 geophysical methods electrical geophysical methods such as electrical resistivity tomography ert and induced polarization ip have been widely applied in hydrogeological and environmental investigations and can be used to determine the subsurface resistivity distribution loke et al 2013 this parameter is linked to various geological features such as the mineral and fluid content water salinity and porosity worthington 1976 barker and moore 1998 ert data acquisition is performed by means of the reiterative injection of an electrical current through a source electrode pair belonging to a lineal electrode array and the subsequent recording of the potential difference between another electrode pair the ip method measures how the electrical potential decays along a given time interval after the removal of an applied electrical current seigel 1959 it is able to detect very low concentrations of metallic and clay minerals in the subsurface given that these minerals accumulate electrical charge at their interfaces while the electrical field is applied to the ground and gradually discharge it once the electrical field is removed these minerals might otherwise be missed if only resistivity surveys are applied geoelectrical imaging was carried out with a multi electrode high resolution 4 channel abem sas 4000 resistivity meter which allows for the determination of resistivity and chargeability underground abem 2006 in this survey 81 steel electrodes were arranged in a straight line with constant spacing using a 4 channel multiple gradient electrode array dahlin and zhou 2006 the gradient protocol relies on a wenner schlumberger electrode array configuration developed for multi channel resistivity meter systems data inversion was performed using res2dinv v 3 59 software loke 2016 selecting a mesh made up of model cells increasing 25 in size with depth trapezoidal finite elements 4 nodes per unit electrode spacing and a 0 3 initial damping factor data were collected along 7 profiles fig 5 located at 3 preferential infiltration areas simas de bérchules de los helechales and de márcula with electrode spacing ranging from 1 to 3 m the normalized depth of investigation doi index method oldenburg and li 1999 marescot et al 2003 provides information about the sectors of the profile where the inversion values are trusted it was obtained carrying out two inversions with a background resistivity of the second reference model that was 100 times the first one a restrictive 0 1 cut off value was selected marescot et al 2003 4 2 2 sedimentological methods sedimentological profiling of the deposits of sima de bérchules was focused on their genetic interpretation and architectural organization so as to characterize bounding surfaces identifiable in the geophysical profiles vibracores fig 2g were recovered at four drilling sites fig 7 with twin cores some decimetres away at each point recovery was continuous in pvc pipes 5 cm in diameter the retrieved lengths were 4 7 m sb1 2 m sb2 1 m sb3 and 2 m sb4 geophysical profiling density porosity and magnetic susceptibility with 1 cm spacing was carried out for cores sb1 sb3 and sb4 using a multisensor core logger geotek in addition four samples from core sb1 were analysed for grain size sieving and sedigraph and another four samples were used for semiquantitative mineralogical analysis total rock and clay fraction by means of drx in an xpert pro mpd panalytical following the procedures of schultz 1964 and barahona 1974 original depths of the cores mechanically compressed were corrected to obtain the real depths of the deposits and bounding surfaces to be used when interpreting the geophysical profiles the sedimentological studies were completed through outcrop observations in two gullies 1 m high 4 2 3 chronological methods the chronological record was determined using optically stimulated luminescence dating osl luminescence signals of quartz grains are a powerful means of examining daylight exposure at the soil surface on a decadal to millennial time scale heimsath et al 2002 duller 2008 preusser et al 2009 measurements including luminescence to estimate the accumulated dose and gamma spectroscopy to determine the concentration of radionuclides were carried out at the university of seville radioisotopes unit rdi osl dating was applied to a total of six samples two from the wall of two gullies ber 1 and ber 2 located in the sima two samples from core sb1 and one sample each from cores sb2 and sb4 after sieving the samples to fraction 180 250 µm and treating them with hcl and h2o2 to dissolve carbonates and organic matter respectively density separation was undertaken to isolate the quartz rich fraction it was then treated with hf 40 to dissolve the remaining feldspar and remove the outer layer of quartz grains affected by alpha radiation initial measurements using infrared stimulation ir indicate the presence of feldspar in the quartz fraction even after chemical treatment post ir osl roberts and wintle 2003 served to deplete the contribution of feldspar in the osl signal used to calculate the equivalent dose of each sample 24 48 small multi grain aliquots 30 grains per aliquot of each sample could then be measured burial doses were estimated using the central age model cam galbraith et al 1999 unless otherwise stated dose rates were calculated from the activity concentration of radionuclides in the surrounding sediment derived from high resolution gamma spectroscopy on approximately 100 g of ground bulk material a contribution from cosmic radiation was calculated in view of the sample depth assuming a linear accumulation of deposits water content of 17 5 was taken as representative of the burial period and attenuation of the dose rate was appraised accordingly geographical position and sediment overburden were also taken into account in the calculation total dose rates to an infinite matrix were calculated using drac v1 2 durcan et al 2015 4 3 infiltration capacity efficiency of acequia de el espino during the 2014 15 hydrological year flow infiltrated in acequia de el espino was determined through two automatic capacitance water level loggers they were installed in order to measure the inlet flow in acequia de el espino and sima de bérchules i e points 2 and 13 respectively in fig 5a and set to log the height of the water level in the channel every hour the first was installed 110 m from the beginning of the channel point 2 in fig 5a and the second was located upstream of sima de bérchules point 13 in fig 5a at these two points the velocity of water flowing through the acequia was measured fortnightly using c2 10 150 ott flowmeter the water flow rate at each point was obtained by multiplying the obtained velocity by the corresponding channel section the propellers and the body of the flowmeter were regularly calibrated following the iso 3455 standard in addition 13 flow measurements were recorded 04 28 2015 throughout the acequia del espino channel to identify stretches where infiltration was concentrated fig 5a 5 results 5 1 historical and archaeological analysis to berchules village firstly appear in documents from the 10th century as a district yuz called buryil sánchez martínez 1976 trillo san josé 1994 the arrival of arab and berber conquerors in the 8th century had led to great changes in the settlement patterns and landscapes with the creation of alquerías villages and the construction of productive systems linked to water new peoples from the middle east yemen arabia syria and jordan and north africa settled there or nearby this population organized by kinship relationships was responsible for the creation of irrigation and aquifer recharge systems from the 8th century onwards glick and kirchner 2000 martín civantos 2007 2011 the careos system is specifically documented in lugros valley n side of sierra nevada in the 11th century thanks to a lawsuit between two villages fighting over water rights martín civantos 2010 separate neighbourhoods are still mentioned in 16th century documents lar 1573 in bérchules there were three purchena cuchurrio and alcútar there were also nine watermills and several farms spread around in the territory indeed the whole alquería village of bérchules was designed as a settlement a territory plus the community that occupied and managed it according to 16th century documentation lar 1573 bérchules neighbours had the right to use water from bérchules river fig 4 through five channels acequias from the grande river the highest channel was acequia de las hoyas which irrigates the eastern slope of the valley from the chico river three channels were caught above the intersection of two rivers and another one just below the highest is the acequia de el espino the second channel called the acequia real is located downstream and begins just where the intensively irrigated zone of the basin starts finally the acequia nueva catches water after the two rivers join and it also irrigates as far as the cairo ravine the castillian conquest took place in 1492 when the arabic kingdom of granada surrendered still the population was allowed to stay after a forced conversion to christianity until they rebelled against the castillians and were defeated between 1568 and 1571 after that the converted muslims or moriscos were forced to leave this land and new population arrived from different parts of the iberian peninsula amazingly the careo based water management system has survived until now and is still functional despite the shift away from traditional agriculture the first specific reference to aquifer recharge including its description was made in 1805 by the naturalist simón de rojas clemente rojas visited the valley of mecina bombarón near bérchules and described the careos and simas and their management guzmán 2010 from the onset the entire system was designed and managed by a peasant community that is water was communally managed but water was a land right all landowners holding water rights formed a group responsible for the system s maintenance and management in the 19th century these groups were institutionalized by the national water law martín retortillo baquer 1963 1991 2014 and water management continued to be communal up to the present 5 2 sedimentary infill analysis and dating 5 2 1 geophysics seven geoelectrical profiles fig 5 were conducted between october 2014 sima de bérchules and april 2016 sima de márcula and de los helechales acquisition in the former location was performed after the infiltration period while the geophysical profiles for sima de márcula and sima de los helechales took place after an anomalous dry winter affecting the resistivity values the effective penetration depths are around 13 and 50 m depending on the electrode spacing selected ranging from 1 to 3 m total length of the profiles was between 80 and 240 m the resistivity models obtained from 2d inversion of the data acquired in sima de bérchules fig 7 show a relatively low resistive layer 2000 ω m at surface corresponding to the siliciclastic deposits below it the non altered rocks are represented by a resistive zone 2500 ω m that extends downwards from the surface and or from the lower boundary of the conductive altered area this lower resistive body is laterally and abruptly distorted by sub vertical lower resistivity bodies with high chargeability values around 600 ω m see supplementary data that are interpreted as sub vertical fractures with metallic mineralizations core sb1 fig 8 reveals a minimum thickness of 4 4 m for the sedimentary infill the intersection of the core with the bedrock coincides with the 2000 ω m resistivity contour line this boundary was chosen to mark the base of the sedimentary infill with black dashed lines showing a maximum thickness of 10 m to the south of the sb1 borehole in the case of sima de márcula and de los helechales the resistivity values obtained through the 2d inversion models figs s2 and s3 supplementary data differ from those of sima de los bérchules probably due to the amount of water contained in the subsurface during the field survey the sima de bérchules recharge area was fully saturated whereas the other sectors were not used to infiltrate water that year the altered sedimentary infill shows resistivity values greater than 1500 ω m and a lower development than in sima de bérchules with respective maximum thicknesses of 8 and 2 m in applying the doi index method to obtain the depth of investigation a cut off value of 0 1 was chosen and highlighted on the profiles using a white dashed line figs s1 s2 and s3 of the supplementary data above this contour data show an overall high resolution yet below it the profiles are less reliable note that the bottom of the sedimentary infill is consistently over the doi limit 5 2 2 sedimentology siliciclastic deposits of the bérchules márcula and helechales simas are always found on the downslope side of acequia de el espino where the outflow gates to divert the flow to flood the simas and recharge the aquifer are also situated the deposits are gravels sands and silts arranged in an approximately lens shaped body having an erosive bottom and concave top 10 m thick fig 7 lying unconformably upon weathered schists of the nevado filábride complex at 4 4 m depth in core sb1 fig 8 gravels are clast supported with sub rounded clasts of schists and minor amounts of subangular clasts of quartzite and quartz the clast size mode ranges from 0 4 to 1 cm maximum size varies from 4 to 4 5 cm in the drilled cores the scarce matrix is composed by sand and silt sized grains of quartz main plagioclase and or amphibole secondary and very low amounts of clay mica chlorite and kaolinite these deposits are arranged in unordered or fining upwards layers of thickness 0 05 0 33 cm lateral and vertically they evolve into medium to fine sands with sparse clasts up to 4 cm in diameter and variable content in a clayey silty matrix the mineralogical composition of the sands is similar to that of the matrix of the gravels the silty layers show a mineralogical composition similar to the sandy layers and they may contain variable amounts of sand and low content in clays these facies are related laterally downslope and vertically forming fining upward sequences of gravel sand sand silt and less frequently gravel sand silt fig 8 mineralogical composition and textural features of the deposits reflect short distance transport a source area of the sediments near the sima de bérchules by high energy water currents that underwent a sudden loss of competence due to their position the most plausible interpretation is that they are lobes rooted in the overflow gates of acequia de el espino with a fining upward trend related to the vanishing of the flow and a fining lateral trend owing to radial and downslope loss of competence the piling up of sandy layers upon gravels in core sb1 which can be correlated to gravels atop core sb4 fig 9 records the lateral migration of successive lobes rooted in the same gate as they adapt to the morphology of the previous lobes 5 2 3 age of the sediments dose distributions derived from the post ir osl measurements are well defined with over dispersion od below 20 for samples ber 1 sb1 sb2 and sb4 the dose distribution of samples ber 2 and sb1 has respective ods of 25 and 28 suggesting these units could be slightly affected by incomplete bleaching i e grains that were not exposed to sunlight enough to reset their osl signal before being deposited and buried this implies that some of the grains still had a residual dose at the moment of burial meaning a higher value than the true burial dose in an attempt to identify the part of the population most likely to be well bleached the finite mixture model galbraith et al 1999 was applied instead of cam the model identifies two components the lower one is used to estimate the burial dose assuming the higher dose values are affected by partial bleaching estimated burial doses and derived ages for the four samples are summarized in table 1 5 3 infiltration capacity efficiency of acequia de el espino during the hydrological year 2014 15 all the water diverted to acequia de el espino 1 57 hm3 was infiltrated most infiltration occurred along the channel 1 30 hm3 and 0 27 hm3 were poured at the sima de bérchules in the period from april 1st to may 15th 2015 between may 15th and june 15th the diverted water was infiltrated along the channel before arriving at sima de bérchules as illustrated in fig 10 the water flow diverted from the river would have been higher than 150 l s to reach the sima de bérchules also evident is the similar evolution of the temporal flow variations in the two control sections points 2 and 13 in fig 5a with flow differences around the interval 120 300 l s revealing the substantial infiltration capacity of the acequia fig 11 thirteen flow measurements were conducted at different points along the acequia de el espino on april 28th 2015 fig 5a and 11 flow rates were between 61 and 234 l s on the way to sima de bérchules 173 l s were infiltrated and 61 l s at sima de bérchules itself therefore all the diverted water from the river was entirely infiltrated at the schist weathered zone downstream of the sections having greater infiltration numerous springs emerge fig 4b and there are ravines with dense riverbank vegetation fed by these channels 6 discussion the use of water from ephemeral streams for water harvesting was at the root of livelihood in several arid and semi arid areas of the earth thousands of years ago evenari et al 1971 prinz 1996 managed aquifer recharge understood as a method to intentionally recharge and hence store water in aquifers for subsequent recovery or for environmental benefits is more recent an inventory of managed aquifer recharge mar sites in europe sprenger et al 2017 indicates that the first mar site in europe was located in glasgow uk where a collector pipe parallel to the clyde river was built in 1810 however the acequias de careo in sierra nevada spain are a much older and more fascinating example of mar the ancestral mar techniques are not exclusive of europe similar examples of ancestral groundwater recharge systems have been described in south america yapa 2016 in the ecuadorean coastal provinces of santa elena and manabi thousands of artificial u shaped lagoons called albarradas appear at places occupying a few hectares of surface area dated from 4000 bp marcos 2006 they retain and recharge water behind small earth dams yapa 2016 for the same purpose peru contains circular excavations of small size and little depth the cuchacuchas of ayacucho or of larger dimensions qochas all over the countryside yet of all the precolonial mar systems described by yapa 2016 the most surprising system due to its similarity with the acequias de careo is that of the amunas also called mamanteo ochoa tocachi et al 2019 the recharge procedure is the same as in sierra nevada despite 1 having an ocean in between and 2 both being developed several centuries before the connection between the two cultures thus the scenarios had much in common from physiographic geological and climatic viewpoints which may have to do with their arrival at the same solution also impressive is the high degree of hydrogeological knowledge and the remarkable technological development achieved by our ancestors amunas and acequias de careo were created with a great precision having minimum slopes to avoid high water speed and featured gadgets to control the flow the capacity of infiltration the speed of water to reduce erosion etc espín et al 2010 nowadays the acequias de careo mar technique could be applied to other mountains areas in regions of arid and semi arid conditions such as the atlas n africa the southern rocky mountains n america and the zagros mountains and part of the himalayas central asia they meet two requirements allowing for extrapolation of this recharge technique availability of water for recharge and permeable rock outcrops nonetheless another fundamental aspect for the success of the mar technique is the existence of a human community capable of working in coordination to achieve the common good of enhanced water availability during dry periods the historical and archaeological research that dates the careos in sierra nevada since the 11th century at least martín civantos 2010 documents them specifically in bérchules since the 15th 16th century the acequia de el espino is described in lar 1573 as a consolidated infrastructure with historical rights since the islamic period hence at least since the 15th century attempting to date the deposits of the recharge areas linked to the acequia del espino is in this sense an intriguing and complicated task most sediments that crop out downslope in the surroundings of the acequia de el espino are anthropic their location and textural features poor sorting and roundness geometry of the bodies poorly defined stratification point to an origin related to the sudden spreading of a confined flow from the irrigation channels most likely during the opening of the channel gates in human induced recharge events the repetition of such events over centuries led to the genesis of fan shaped bodies up to 10 m thick sediment dating with osl indicates that the sampled sedimentary filling material is recent although the oldest samples might call for a more accurate age analysis the estimated ages are coherent with historical references regarding ancient agricultural practices in the study zone most samples were deposited between 1896 and 636 a d the oldest sample by far corresponds to sb1 dated as 636 a d 80 coinciding with the end of the visigothic period when a population increase occurred in sierra nevada martín civantos 2007 the rest of the sediment samples are dated between 1676 and 1896 being the result of a continued annual use of the careo recharge system as explained by simón de rojas in 1805 this work serves to highlight the efficiency of acequia de el espino as a mar technique despite the fact that the channel is dug in hard rock during the hydrological year 2014 2015 this channel recharged 40 of the total bérchules river runoff measured at the outlet of the basin martos rosillo et al 2017 different research efforts in this basin jódar et al 2017 2018 martos rosillo et al 2017 barberá et al 2018 have shown that the careo recharge increases the mean groundwater runoff and also reduces the peak of the river hydrograph while increasing the river base flow moreover modification of the hydrological basin behaviour leaves an aquifer discharge fingerprint in the physicochemical and isotopic characteristics of water runoff that in turn facilitates characterization of the basin behaviour the increase in both the river base flow and the number of springs related to the acequias de careo recharge has favoured the development of agriculture and livestock practices promoting settlement in sierra nevada since the middle ages in addition to the profits from this management aquifer recharge for local populations it benefits the basin associated ecosystems a greater groundwater discharge along the slopes of the mountain increases the vegetation cover the riparian vegetation and the species diversity of flora and fauna in the watershed therefore the careo recharge is not only a mar system but also a living example of ancestral integrated groundwater resources management jakeman et al 2016 the careo recharge system has survived drastic environmental and social changes that have taken place over the past centuries demonstrating a high resilience capacity nowadays this ancient integrated water management system is seriously threatened by different drivers the aging of the people who preserve and maintain the system the migration of local population to urban areas and inadequate agrarian and water policies mar is a very important activity for the maintenance and functionality of the agrarian system indeed most of the crops have been traditionally irrigated since the medieval period yet water availability for irrigation depends directly on how the upper parts of the mountain are managed the recharge also affects the livelihood of communities situated downstream the agrarian crisis resulting from modernization processes has left these traditional areas marginalized leading to an exodus of the population and the abandonment of part of the systems that is the loss of traditional ecological knowledge communal work and solidarities delgado anés 2017 ruiz ruiz and martín civantos 2017 the whole area was fossilized until recent years when new crops and investments arrived attracted by the altitude and the possibilities of off season production the intensive production of cherry tomatoes for example threats the historical systems due to the construction of private pools and wells for pressured irrigation many wells even inside the protected area are illegal fortunately the aquifer recharge was maintained in the acequia del espino because the older farmers were fully aware of its importance at present the situation is relatively stable the international market prices have come down and competition with other regions is greater but at the same time the irrigator community is reacting against the individual interests that threaten the common wealth irrigator communities and water management systems have also proven to be extremely resilient over the centuries 7 conclusions this study focuses on the acequias de careo as the oldest mar system in europe in the 11th century they were already operational in sierra nevada according to historical written documents records further describe the existence already in operation of the acequia de el espino in 1573 at a later date in 1805 the recharging procedure used in one of the irrigation ditches belonging to the bérchules basin was fully described in historical documents the water flowing at the recharge channel also pours into flat and highly permeable areas called simas geological and geophysical research have shown that these simas consist of an artificial sedimentary infill composed of gravel sand and silt which is closely related with the operation of the channel the dating of quartz grains embedded in the sedimentary filling material reveals that these grains were deposited between 636 a d and today the dating results largely corroborate the historical information notwithstanding key methodological questions arise when trying to establish chronologies and a sequence of human occupation and questions of a historical nature surround the origin of the acequias de careo and the development and implementation of recharge techniques by the hispano romans before 711 a d and by arabs and berbers after their invasion of the iberian peninsula this system devised by our ancestors as a tool for adapting to water scarcity could be applied in other alpine basins or high altitude basins around the world as a valuable strategy to mitigate the forecast impact of climate change the survival or improvement of this ancestral recharge system is therefore imperative the acequias de careo call for institutional support so that new research projects can be undertaken promoting global cooperation between scientists and the communities involved in ancestral recharge techniques despite the critical social situation of the small villages in the mountainous areas of study a substantial part of the irrigation system is preserved and maintained policies should be oriented toward restoration of the infrastructures and the recovery of traditional practices and knowledge in conjunction with scientific research while historical irrigation systems have demonstrated their resilience they are essential for a great variety of ecosystem services that depend on agrarian production and farmers agrarian heritage is dynamic and policies must take environmental and cultural considerations into account in addition to scientific and historical knowledge in sum agriculture should be understood as a multifunctional activity closely linked to nature and culture social cohesion and wellbeing credit authorship contribution statement s martos rosillo conceptualization methodology

6137,in sierra nevada southern spain the highest mountain range in southern europe the application of an ancestral integrated water resources management system iwrm based on the conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water provides water resources for irrigation and supply in the driest months of the year in this semiarid mountain region meltwater is derived from the headwaters of the mountain streams and rivers through a set of uncoated channels excavated in the ground locally known as acequias de careo to infiltrate at the upper part of the valleys water infiltrated along the acequias de careo slowly flows down the hillsides through the weathered zone of the hard rock aquifer and the glacial and periglacial sediments the recharge accomplished through this managed aquifer recharge technique mar activates numerous springs located halfway down the hillside and increases the base flow of the rivers in this study focused on a careo channel located on the southern slope of sierra nevada called acequia de el espino different archaeological sedimentological geophysical and hydrogeological techniques are applied to determine the age and the efficiency of this ancestral example of a mar and iwrm system results suggest that the acequias de careo may be the oldest mar system in europe and that this mar technique could be applied in other high mountain alpine watersheds

recognized as a biosphere reserve by unesco 1986 and as a national park 1999 due to its altitude and orographic effects rainfall is higher than the average for the surrounding area and often occurs in the form of snow for these reasons runoff is essential for supplying resources for agriculture and tourism and for maintaining the environmental value of the associated ecosystems the sierra nevada foothills and the adjacent depressions have been colonized since palaeolithic and neolithic times by subsequent civilizations attracted by the abundance of water coming from the snow accumulated on its summits gómez ortiz et al 2013 close to sierra nevada there are several sites where irrigated agriculture was presumably practiced in the framework of the el argar and los millares cultures over 4000 years ago giráldez et al 1988 gilman and thornes 2014 irrigation techniques flourished in the middle ages during the spanish islamic period glick and kirchner 2000 roldán and moreno 2010 from the 8th century up to the conquest of granada by the christians in the late 15th century the arab culture left an outstanding imprint on the water management of all al ándalus the name of the vast territory of the iberian peninsula governed by the muslims glick and kirchner 2000 vivas et al 2009 water supply to large cities such as córdoba the most populous city of that time with more than one million inhabitants helped the muslims of al ándalus recover and even exceed the splendour of the roman empire roldán and moreno 2010 however their main advances were focused on irrigation from a technological point of view the islamic civilization made an extensive compilation and improvement of the irrigation techniques of the ancient world and obviously applied them widely in al ándalus roldán and moreno 2010 they constructed dykes and dams to derive water from rivers and ephemeral streams and extracted groundwater by means of qanats and wells kamash 2012 and water harvesting techniques the latter were used for thousands of years in northern africa and the arabian peninsula prinz 1996 water harvesting comprises the collection of runoff and its use for the irrigation of crops pastures and trees and for livestock consumption finkel and finkel 1986 indigenous systems then applied often still remain in use jessour and meskat in tunisia tabia in libya cisterns in northern egypt hafaer in jordan and syria or the hillsite conduit systems used in israel and north yemen prinz 1996 oweis and hachum 2006 the surficial water and the groundwater collected were subsequently distributed over growing areas through irrigation channels or canals roldán and moreno 2010 in sierra nevada water harvesting and groundwater use were combined and incorporated into an original and advanced integrated water resources management iwrm system based on the conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water indeed the muslims being experts in irrigated crops martín civantos 2011 made an outsized effort to develop innumerable cultivation terraces fig 2 a around the villages of sierra nevada martín civantos 2007 these orchards were flooded by means of irrigation channels acequias built and maintained by the community fig 2c yet the rivers and springs flow diminished in summer precisely when the water demand was greater for this reason the muslims established a water management system that consisted of deriving the meltwater from the headwaters of the mountain streams and rivers fig 2c and 2d and recharging it halfway down the hillside fig 2e and 2f through long uncoated channels excavated in the ground pulido bosch and sbih 1995 these channels are locally known as acequias de careo water infiltrated along the acequias de careo slowly flows downhill through the weathered zone of the hard rock aquifer during the dry season it arises through springs located halfway down the hillside and or through the rivers from which it was derived during the thaw increasing its base flow fig 3 in summer the acequias de careo are no longer used and another extensive network of irrigation channels located at a lower altitude begins to divert water from the rivers to the agricultural areas in sierra nevada there are more than 700 km of acequias de careo fig 1c most of them still working their existence at least since the middle ages has been historically documented martín civantos 2010 and it is known that most of these channels were already operative when the castillians conquered the territory toward the end of the middle ages delaigue 1995 our analysis is focused on a careo channel called acequia de el espino which is located in the bérchules river valley fig 4 on the southern slope of sierra nevada the aim of this study is to determine the age and the efficiency of this ancestral example of a mar and iwrm system to this end we used a multidisciplinary approach applying diverse archaeological sedimentological geophysical and hydrogeological techniques firstly we describe the hydrogeological features of the region and the operating mode of the acequias de careo mar system geophysical and sedimentological studies of the sedimentary infill associated with the preferential recharge areas allowed us to establish its geometry and its anthropic origin respectively subsequently an analysis of archive records and geochronological techniques osl led us to establish the workability of the system since at least the 11th century finally the present day infiltration capacity of the system was determined through continuous measurement of the flow recharged at the acequias de careo this multidisciplinary study demonstrates that the acequias de careo constitute the oldest mar system in europe 2 hydrogeological setting two main kinds of aquifer formations with clearly differentiated hydrogeological behaviour can be found in sierra nevada fig 1b 1 the shallowest part of the schists of the nevado filábride complex which crop out in the core of sierra nevada where the range reaches the highest elevation the weathered zone of these rocks together with the glacial and periglacial quaternary formations of the highest areas of the mountain form an extensive aquifer in hard rocks 1358 km2 and 2 the carbonate rocks of the alpujarride complex that partially surround the schists from the west and south of sierra nevada fig 1b metamorphic rocks of the nevado filábride complex mainly fine grained feldspathic graphite schists with quartzite intercalations crop out in nearly all the bérchules river basin fig 4b they show a very penetrative foliation with a general dip towards the n ne the weathered zone of metamorphic rocks constitutes a surficial aquifer of reduced thickness maximum depths of 30 50 m but very extensive since it practically covers the whole sierra nevada it comprises an upper part formed by weathered and disintegrated schists saprolite and a lower fissured and fractured zone saprock that extends in depth to the unaltered rock at elevations higher than 2500 m a s l low temperatures determine the predominance of physical weathering by crioclastic processes with the development of a crioclastic layer that occupies the entire summit area except for the most rugged zones in the highest areas the surficial aquifer is formed by debris deposits they are scree or talus deposits located at the foot of the escarpments or glacial sediments accumulated at the top of the highest valleys below 2500 m a s l the increase in temperature favours edaphization and chemical weathering processes which may lead to a decrease in permeability at the alteration zone owing to the presence of a greater clayey fraction the hydrogeological behaviour of this shallowest aquifer depends on the altitude in the upper parts of the study zone almost all the runoff infiltrates in the aquifer this is due to the high permeability of the existing talus deposits along with the low slope of the sierra nevada highlands in these zones infiltration is even enhanced by the high proportion of snowfall precipitation and its slow melting process moreover as altitude decreases mean precipitation drops and mean temperature rises and evapotranspiration is greater as the glacial and periglacial sediments disappear as a result the aquifer is mainly constituted by the surface weathered zone of the schists all these facts cause the natural aquifer recharge to noticeably decrease in the altitudinal range between 2000 and 1600 m a s l with respect to the highest areas of sierra nevada below 1600 m a s l which is the average altitude of the recharge channels ortiz moreno 2010 recharge increases again martos rosillo et al 2017 the limits of the studied aquifer coincide with those of the surface watershed of the bérchules river basin 67 6 km2 the bérchules river is a tributary of the guadalfeo river which flows into the mediterranean sea with an average altitude of 2072 m a s l and slope of 37 its highest point is cerro del gallo peak 2910 m a s l to the north and the lowpoint is at the narila gauging station 979 m a s l to the south the bérchules watershed contains an intricate network of irrigation channels and acequias de careo fig 4 used to 1 transfer water to neighbouring basins 2 recharge the surface aquifer and 3 irrigate crops there are 19 main channels giving a total length of 57 45 km 21 km of them being specifically acequias de careo the main recharge channels of the bérchules basin are the acequia de el espino 7 km and the acequia de trevélez 11 km until it enters the bérchules basin the latter acequia transfers water from the left bank of the trevélez river to the bérchules river basin where it is recharged in turn the acequia de mecina captures water from the grande river and carries it towards the mecina river basin located in the eastward neighbouring hydrological basin the acequia de el espino is therefore one of the recharge channels or acequia de careo that are still active in sierra nevada it is located in the bérchules river basin on the southern slope of the range fig 4 for the period 1970 2013 at the bérchules meteorological station 1319 m a s l the mean annual precipitation is 677 mm yr and the mean annual temperature is 13 3 c for the same period the average annual flowrate of the bérchules river at the gauging station fig 4 is 12 23 hm3 year showing a seasonal pluvio nival fluvial behaviour jódar et al 2017 2018 the soil cover fig 4a is mainly represented by sparse scrub crops conifers and grassland as well as by irrigated horticulture crops particularly in the lowlands but also in a reduced area in the uplands about 260 ha 4 of the total catchment surface area the limits of the aquifer generally coincide with those of the surface watershed of the bérchules river fig 4b in the period 1970 2013 the average recharge of the aquifer is 6 3 hm3 year though 3 1 hm3 year is interflow discharged through numerous springs sprouting on the river slopes martos rosillo et al 2015 therefore the rain infiltrated under edaphic soil and not drained through interflow is recharged in the aquifer and discharged in the bérchules river in addition there are 20 wells fig 4b with flows lower than 2 l s which are used as support for irrigation and supply to livestock hydrological models have made it possible to estimate the groundwater component of total runoff at the bérchules basin between 76 and 95 martos rosillo et al 2015 jódar et al 2017 2018 this large contribution of groundwater to the total basin runoff underlines the important role of aquifer recharge in the basin confirmed by studies involving environmental tracers barberá et al 2018 moreover the high inertial functioning of this river is a consequence of the managed aquifer recharge mar carried out through the acequias de careo martos rosillo et al 2017 3 the recharge channel of acequia de el espino the acequia de el espino is a channel excavated in metamorphic rocks it starts as a simple and small diversion dyke locally known as toma made of slabs of schists without mortar and arranged in the chico de bérchules river bed fig 2c and d at 1998 m a s l this dyke allows the diversion of water from the river towards the channel the average height slope and width of this channel are respectively 1905 m a s l 6 8 and 1 5 m two members of the irrigation community of bérchules fig 2c are in charge of the management and control of the diversion dyke including repairing the basin channel system and distributing the diverted water this is done following the same ancient practices of their ancestors transmitted from generation to generation the acequia de el espino ends in the sima de bérchules at 1820 m a s l and it does not present any derivation for irrigation purposes along its entire path however four main recharge zones fig 5 can be distinguished along the channel 1 sima de los helechales average elevation and area of 1888 m a s l and 4910 m2 respectively 2 sima del barranco de montina 1866 m a s l and 2117 m2 3 sima de márcula 1821 m a s l and 25901 m2 and finally 4 sima de bérchules 1820 m a s l and 32328 m2 which is the most important recharge zone and consists of a surface covered by grass whose substrate is characterized by its high infiltration capacity fig 2e and 2f in dry periods river water begins to be diverted in november december in years with rainfall equal to or greater than the average and with a large amount of snow accumulated in the upper part of the basin water is diverted later february march during the melting season april to june the river flowrate increases and so do water derivations through the channel this flowrate increase in the channel allows the diverted water to reach the sima de bérchules recharge area if the infiltration capacity of both the channel and the sima de bérchules is surpassed then the other three recharge zones located upstream i e sima de márcula sima barranco montina and sima de los helechales are put into operation using a simple water bypass system 4 methodology this study is based on the application of several archaeological sedimentological geophysical and hydrogeological procedures fig 6 summarizes them and the objectives related to each technique hydrogeological methods have been applied to determine the infiltration capacity of the acequias de careo and to define their operation method sedimentological and geophysical investigations have allowed us to establish the origin and geometry of the sedimentary infill associated with the main recharge zones finally the analysis of archive records and the application of geochronological techniques have allowed the determination of the age and the workability of the recharge system 4 1 historical and archaeological analysis the methodology applied is based on the notion that landscapes are the result of continuous modifications of several historical landscapes taking shape over time godelier 1984 landscape understood as a synthesis of social and environmental relations and taking into account its formation process can be decoded it is a set composed of stratified apprehensible and measurable elements bearing stratigraphic and contextual relationships this means that a given landscape can be known and understood diachronically from an archaeological perspective martín civantos 2006 2008 such is the basis of hydraulic archeology the starting point for a technical and spatial analysis of historical irrigation systems accordingly the study of hydraulic systems cannot be limited to a sum delineation of irrigated spaces or the simple observation of a close relationship between residence areas and their irrigated perimeters analysis must go deeper evaluating transformations of the irrigation space throughout its history with regard to social relationships and the environment barceló 1989 in this sense interdisciplinary approaches as the current one are essential to reach an integrated knowledge about such complex socio ecosystems in addition to the archaeological perspective a thorough knowledge of historical written sources and place names is fundamental in bérchules specific references are almost absent until the castillian conquest in 1492 the main available source of information is a document called libro de apeo y repartimiento lar 1573 lars record surveys and demarcations made in the 16th century by the christian authorities to register the existing assets in each village after the expulsion of the moorish population they served the crown for the reorganization of space as well as for obtaining tax revenue and contain geographic data agricultural production place names surnames crops number of houses mills etc 4 2 sedimentary infill analysis the recharge zones simas related to the acequia de el espino are surfaces covered with pasture and very sparse rocky outcrops consequently subsurface techniques shallow geophysical methods and coring are the main tools used to characterize the geometry and nature of the sedimentary infill 4 2 1 geophysical methods electrical geophysical methods such as electrical resistivity tomography ert and induced polarization ip have been widely applied in hydrogeological and environmental investigations and can be used to determine the subsurface resistivity distribution loke et al 2013 this parameter is linked to various geological features such as the mineral and fluid content water salinity and porosity worthington 1976 barker and moore 1998 ert data acquisition is performed by means of the reiterative injection of an electrical current through a source electrode pair belonging to a lineal electrode array and the subsequent recording of the potential difference between another electrode pair the ip method measures how the electrical potential decays along a given time interval after the removal of an applied electrical current seigel 1959 it is able to detect very low concentrations of metallic and clay minerals in the subsurface given that these minerals accumulate electrical charge at their interfaces while the electrical field is applied to the ground and gradually discharge it once the electrical field is removed these minerals might otherwise be missed if only resistivity surveys are applied geoelectrical imaging was carried out with a multi electrode high resolution 4 channel abem sas 4000 resistivity meter which allows for the determination of resistivity and chargeability underground abem 2006 in this survey 81 steel electrodes were arranged in a straight line with constant spacing using a 4 channel multiple gradient electrode array dahlin and zhou 2006 the gradient protocol relies on a wenner schlumberger electrode array configuration developed for multi channel resistivity meter systems data inversion was performed using res2dinv v 3 59 software loke 2016 selecting a mesh made up of model cells increasing 25 in size with depth trapezoidal finite elements 4 nodes per unit electrode spacing and a 0 3 initial damping factor data were collected along 7 profiles fig 5 located at 3 preferential infiltration areas simas de bérchules de los helechales and de márcula with electrode spacing ranging from 1 to 3 m the normalized depth of investigation doi index method oldenburg and li 1999 marescot et al 2003 provides information about the sectors of the profile where the inversion values are trusted it was obtained carrying out two inversions with a background resistivity of the second reference model that was 100 times the first one a restrictive 0 1 cut off value was selected marescot et al 2003 4 2 2 sedimentological methods sedimentological profiling of the deposits of sima de bérchules was focused on their genetic interpretation and architectural organization so as to characterize bounding surfaces identifiable in the geophysical profiles vibracores fig 2g were recovered at four drilling sites fig 7 with twin cores some decimetres away at each point recovery was continuous in pvc pipes 5 cm in diameter the retrieved lengths were 4 7 m sb1 2 m sb2 1 m sb3 and 2 m sb4 geophysical profiling density porosity and magnetic susceptibility with 1 cm spacing was carried out for cores sb1 sb3 and sb4 using a multisensor core logger geotek in addition four samples from core sb1 were analysed for grain size sieving and sedigraph and another four samples were used for semiquantitative mineralogical analysis total rock and clay fraction by means of drx in an xpert pro mpd panalytical following the procedures of schultz 1964 and barahona 1974 original depths of the cores mechanically compressed were corrected to obtain the real depths of the deposits and bounding surfaces to be used when interpreting the geophysical profiles the sedimentological studies were completed through outcrop observations in two gullies 1 m high 4 2 3 chronological methods the chronological record was determined using optically stimulated luminescence dating osl luminescence signals of quartz grains are a powerful means of examining daylight exposure at the soil surface on a decadal to millennial time scale heimsath et al 2002 duller 2008 preusser et al 2009 measurements including luminescence to estimate the accumulated dose and gamma spectroscopy to determine the concentration of radionuclides were carried out at the university of seville radioisotopes unit rdi osl dating was applied to a total of six samples two from the wall of two gullies ber 1 and ber 2 located in the sima two samples from core sb1 and one sample each from cores sb2 and sb4 after sieving the samples to fraction 180 250 µm and treating them with hcl and h2o2 to dissolve carbonates and organic matter respectively density separation was undertaken to isolate the quartz rich fraction it was then treated with hf 40 to dissolve the remaining feldspar and remove the outer layer of quartz grains affected by alpha radiation initial measurements using infrared stimulation ir indicate the presence of feldspar in the quartz fraction even after chemical treatment post ir osl roberts and wintle 2003 served to deplete the contribution of feldspar in the osl signal used to calculate the equivalent dose of each sample 24 48 small multi grain aliquots 30 grains per aliquot of each sample could then be measured burial doses were estimated using the central age model cam galbraith et al 1999 unless otherwise stated dose rates were calculated from the activity concentration of radionuclides in the surrounding sediment derived from high resolution gamma spectroscopy on approximately 100 g of ground bulk material a contribution from cosmic radiation was calculated in view of the sample depth assuming a linear accumulation of deposits water content of 17 5 was taken as representative of the burial period and attenuation of the dose rate was appraised accordingly geographical position and sediment overburden were also taken into account in the calculation total dose rates to an infinite matrix were calculated using drac v1 2 durcan et al 2015 4 3 infiltration capacity efficiency of acequia de el espino during the 2014 15 hydrological year flow infiltrated in acequia de el espino was determined through two automatic capacitance water level loggers they were installed in order to measure the inlet flow in acequia de el espino and sima de bérchules i e points 2 and 13 respectively in fig 5a and set to log the height of the water level in the channel every hour the first was installed 110 m from the beginning of the channel point 2 in fig 5a and the second was located upstream of sima de bérchules point 13 in fig 5a at these two points the velocity of water flowing through the acequia was measured fortnightly using c2 10 150 ott flowmeter the water flow rate at each point was obtained by multiplying the obtained velocity by the corresponding channel section the propellers and the body of the flowmeter were regularly calibrated following the iso 3455 standard in addition 13 flow measurements were recorded 04 28 2015 throughout the acequia del espino channel to identify stretches where infiltration was concentrated fig 5a 5 results 5 1 historical and archaeological analysis to berchules village firstly appear in documents from the 10th century as a district yuz called buryil sánchez martínez 1976 trillo san josé 1994 the arrival of arab and berber conquerors in the 8th century had led to great changes in the settlement patterns and landscapes with the creation of alquerías villages and the construction of productive systems linked to water new peoples from the middle east yemen arabia syria and jordan and north africa settled there or nearby this population organized by kinship relationships was responsible for the creation of irrigation and aquifer recharge systems from the 8th century onwards glick and kirchner 2000 martín civantos 2007 2011 the careos system is specifically documented in lugros valley n side of sierra nevada in the 11th century thanks to a lawsuit between two villages fighting over water rights martín civantos 2010 separate neighbourhoods are still mentioned in 16th century documents lar 1573 in bérchules there were three purchena cuchurrio and alcútar there were also nine watermills and several farms spread around in the territory indeed the whole alquería village of bérchules was designed as a settlement a territory plus the community that occupied and managed it according to 16th century documentation lar 1573 bérchules neighbours had the right to use water from bérchules river fig 4 through five channels acequias from the grande river the highest channel was acequia de las hoyas which irrigates the eastern slope of the valley from the chico river three channels were caught above the intersection of two rivers and another one just below the highest is the acequia de el espino the second channel called the acequia real is located downstream and begins just where the intensively irrigated zone of the basin starts finally the acequia nueva catches water after the two rivers join and it also irrigates as far as the cairo ravine the castillian conquest took place in 1492 when the arabic kingdom of granada surrendered still the population was allowed to stay after a forced conversion to christianity until they rebelled against the castillians and were defeated between 1568 and 1571 after that the converted muslims or moriscos were forced to leave this land and new population arrived from different parts of the iberian peninsula amazingly the careo based water management system has survived until now and is still functional despite the shift away from traditional agriculture the first specific reference to aquifer recharge including its description was made in 1805 by the naturalist simón de rojas clemente rojas visited the valley of mecina bombarón near bérchules and described the careos and simas and their management guzmán 2010 from the onset the entire system was designed and managed by a peasant community that is water was communally managed but water was a land right all landowners holding water rights formed a group responsible for the system s maintenance and management in the 19th century these groups were institutionalized by the national water law martín retortillo baquer 1963 1991 2014 and water management continued to be communal up to the present 5 2 sedimentary infill analysis and dating 5 2 1 geophysics seven geoelectrical profiles fig 5 were conducted between october 2014 sima de bérchules and april 2016 sima de márcula and de los helechales acquisition in the former location was performed after the infiltration period while the geophysical profiles for sima de márcula and sima de los helechales took place after an anomalous dry winter affecting the resistivity values the effective penetration depths are around 13 and 50 m depending on the electrode spacing selected ranging from 1 to 3 m total length of the profiles was between 80 and 240 m the resistivity models obtained from 2d inversion of the data acquired in sima de bérchules fig 7 show a relatively low resistive layer 2000 ω m at surface corresponding to the siliciclastic deposits below it the non altered rocks are represented by a resistive zone 2500 ω m that extends downwards from the surface and or from the lower boundary of the conductive altered area this lower resistive body is laterally and abruptly distorted by sub vertical lower resistivity bodies with high chargeability values around 600 ω m see supplementary data that are interpreted as sub vertical fractures with metallic mineralizations core sb1 fig 8 reveals a minimum thickness of 4 4 m for the sedimentary infill the intersection of the core with the bedrock coincides with the 2000 ω m resistivity contour line this boundary was chosen to mark the base of the sedimentary infill with black dashed lines showing a maximum thickness of 10 m to the south of the sb1 borehole in the case of sima de márcula and de los helechales the resistivity values obtained through the 2d inversion models figs s2 and s3 supplementary data differ from those of sima de los bérchules probably due to the amount of water contained in the subsurface during the field survey the sima de bérchules recharge area was fully saturated whereas the other sectors were not used to infiltrate water that year the altered sedimentary infill shows resistivity values greater than 1500 ω m and a lower development than in sima de bérchules with respective maximum thicknesses of 8 and 2 m in applying the doi index method to obtain the depth of investigation a cut off value of 0 1 was chosen and highlighted on the profiles using a white dashed line figs s1 s2 and s3 of the supplementary data above this contour data show an overall high resolution yet below it the profiles are less reliable note that the bottom of the sedimentary infill is consistently over the doi limit 5 2 2 sedimentology siliciclastic deposits of the bérchules márcula and helechales simas are always found on the downslope side of acequia de el espino where the outflow gates to divert the flow to flood the simas and recharge the aquifer are also situated the deposits are gravels sands and silts arranged in an approximately lens shaped body having an erosive bottom and concave top 10 m thick fig 7 lying unconformably upon weathered schists of the nevado filábride complex at 4 4 m depth in core sb1 fig 8 gravels are clast supported with sub rounded clasts of schists and minor amounts of subangular clasts of quartzite and quartz the clast size mode ranges from 0 4 to 1 cm maximum size varies from 4 to 4 5 cm in the drilled cores the scarce matrix is composed by sand and silt sized grains of quartz main plagioclase and or amphibole secondary and very low amounts of clay mica chlorite and kaolinite these deposits are arranged in unordered or fining upwards layers of thickness 0 05 0 33 cm lateral and vertically they evolve into medium to fine sands with sparse clasts up to 4 cm in diameter and variable content in a clayey silty matrix the mineralogical composition of the sands is similar to that of the matrix of the gravels the silty layers show a mineralogical composition similar to the sandy layers and they may contain variable amounts of sand and low content in clays these facies are related laterally downslope and vertically forming fining upward sequences of gravel sand sand silt and less frequently gravel sand silt fig 8 mineralogical composition and textural features of the deposits reflect short distance transport a source area of the sediments near the sima de bérchules by high energy water currents that underwent a sudden loss of competence due to their position the most plausible interpretation is that they are lobes rooted in the overflow gates of acequia de el espino with a fining upward trend related to the vanishing of the flow and a fining lateral trend owing to radial and downslope loss of competence the piling up of sandy layers upon gravels in core sb1 which can be correlated to gravels atop core sb4 fig 9 records the lateral migration of successive lobes rooted in the same gate as they adapt to the morphology of the previous lobes 5 2 3 age of the sediments dose distributions derived from the post ir osl measurements are well defined with over dispersion od below 20 for samples ber 1 sb1 sb2 and sb4 the dose distribution of samples ber 2 and sb1 has respective ods of 25 and 28 suggesting these units could be slightly affected by incomplete bleaching i e grains that were not exposed to sunlight enough to reset their osl signal before being deposited and buried this implies that some of the grains still had a residual dose at the moment of burial meaning a higher value than the true burial dose in an attempt to identify the part of the population most likely to be well bleached the finite mixture model galbraith et al 1999 was applied instead of cam the model identifies two components the lower one is used to estimate the burial dose assuming the higher dose values are affected by partial bleaching estimated burial doses and derived ages for the four samples are summarized in table 1 5 3 infiltration capacity efficiency of acequia de el espino during the hydrological year 2014 15 all the water diverted to acequia de el espino 1 57 hm3 was infiltrated most infiltration occurred along the channel 1 30 hm3 and 0 27 hm3 were poured at the sima de bérchules in the period from april 1st to may 15th 2015 between may 15th and june 15th the diverted water was infiltrated along the channel before arriving at sima de bérchules as illustrated in fig 10 the water flow diverted from the river would have been higher than 150 l s to reach the sima de bérchules also evident is the similar evolution of the temporal flow variations in the two control sections points 2 and 13 in fig 5a with flow differences around the interval 120 300 l s revealing the substantial infiltration capacity of the acequia fig 11 thirteen flow measurements were conducted at different points along the acequia de el espino on april 28th 2015 fig 5a and 11 flow rates were between 61 and 234 l s on the way to sima de bérchules 173 l s were infiltrated and 61 l s at sima de bérchules itself therefore all the diverted water from the river was entirely infiltrated at the schist weathered zone downstream of the sections having greater infiltration numerous springs emerge fig 4b and there are ravines with dense riverbank vegetation fed by these channels 6 discussion the use of water from ephemeral streams for water harvesting was at the root of livelihood in several arid and semi arid areas of the earth thousands of years ago evenari et al 1971 prinz 1996 managed aquifer recharge understood as a method to intentionally recharge and hence store water in aquifers for subsequent recovery or for environmental benefits is more recent an inventory of managed aquifer recharge mar sites in europe sprenger et al 2017 indicates that the first mar site in europe was located in glasgow uk where a collector pipe parallel to the clyde river was built in 1810 however the acequias de careo in sierra nevada spain are a much older and more fascinating example of mar the ancestral mar techniques are not exclusive of europe similar examples of ancestral groundwater recharge systems have been described in south america yapa 2016 in the ecuadorean coastal provinces of santa elena and manabi thousands of artificial u shaped lagoons called albarradas appear at places occupying a few hectares of surface area dated from 4000 bp marcos 2006 they retain and recharge water behind small earth dams yapa 2016 for the same purpose peru contains circular excavations of small size and little depth the cuchacuchas of ayacucho or of larger dimensions qochas all over the countryside yet of all the precolonial mar systems described by yapa 2016 the most surprising system due to its similarity with the acequias de careo is that of the amunas also called mamanteo ochoa tocachi et al 2019 the recharge procedure is the same as in sierra nevada despite 1 having an ocean in between and 2 both being developed several centuries before the connection between the two cultures thus the scenarios had much in common from physiographic geological and climatic viewpoints which may have to do with their arrival at the same solution also impressive is the high degree of hydrogeological knowledge and the remarkable technological development achieved by our ancestors amunas and acequias de careo were created with a great precision having minimum slopes to avoid high water speed and featured gadgets to control the flow the capacity of infiltration the speed of water to reduce erosion etc espín et al 2010 nowadays the acequias de careo mar technique could be applied to other mountains areas in regions of arid and semi arid conditions such as the atlas n africa the southern rocky mountains n america and the zagros mountains and part of the himalayas central asia they meet two requirements allowing for extrapolation of this recharge technique availability of water for recharge and permeable rock outcrops nonetheless another fundamental aspect for the success of the mar technique is the existence of a human community capable of working in coordination to achieve the common good of enhanced water availability during dry periods the historical and archaeological research that dates the careos in sierra nevada since the 11th century at least martín civantos 2010 documents them specifically in bérchules since the 15th 16th century the acequia de el espino is described in lar 1573 as a consolidated infrastructure with historical rights since the islamic period hence at least since the 15th century attempting to date the deposits of the recharge areas linked to the acequia del espino is in this sense an intriguing and complicated task most sediments that crop out downslope in the surroundings of the acequia de el espino are anthropic their location and textural features poor sorting and roundness geometry of the bodies poorly defined stratification point to an origin related to the sudden spreading of a confined flow from the irrigation channels most likely during the opening of the channel gates in human induced recharge events the repetition of such events over centuries led to the genesis of fan shaped bodies up to 10 m thick sediment dating with osl indicates that the sampled sedimentary filling material is recent although the oldest samples might call for a more accurate age analysis the estimated ages are coherent with historical references regarding ancient agricultural practices in the study zone most samples were deposited between 1896 and 636 a d the oldest sample by far corresponds to sb1 dated as 636 a d 80 coinciding with the end of the visigothic period when a population increase occurred in sierra nevada martín civantos 2007 the rest of the sediment samples are dated between 1676 and 1896 being the result of a continued annual use of the careo recharge system as explained by simón de rojas in 1805 this work serves to highlight the efficiency of acequia de el espino as a mar technique despite the fact that the channel is dug in hard rock during the hydrological year 2014 2015 this channel recharged 40 of the total bérchules river runoff measured at the outlet of the basin martos rosillo et al 2017 different research efforts in this basin jódar et al 2017 2018 martos rosillo et al 2017 barberá et al 2018 have shown that the careo recharge increases the mean groundwater runoff and also reduces the peak of the river hydrograph while increasing the river base flow moreover modification of the hydrological basin behaviour leaves an aquifer discharge fingerprint in the physicochemical and isotopic characteristics of water runoff that in turn facilitates characterization of the basin behaviour the increase in both the river base flow and the number of springs related to the acequias de careo recharge has favoured the development of agriculture and livestock practices promoting settlement in sierra nevada since the middle ages in addition to the profits from this management aquifer recharge for local populations it benefits the basin associated ecosystems a greater groundwater discharge along the slopes of the mountain increases the vegetation cover the riparian vegetation and the species diversity of flora and fauna in the watershed therefore the careo recharge is not only a mar system but also a living example of ancestral integrated groundwater resources management jakeman et al 2016 the careo recharge system has survived drastic environmental and social changes that have taken place over the past centuries demonstrating a high resilience capacity nowadays this ancient integrated water management system is seriously threatened by different drivers the aging of the people who preserve and maintain the system the migration of local population to urban areas and inadequate agrarian and water policies mar is a very important activity for the maintenance and functionality of the agrarian system indeed most of the crops have been traditionally irrigated since the medieval period yet water availability for irrigation depends directly on how the upper parts of the mountain are managed the recharge also affects the livelihood of communities situated downstream the agrarian crisis resulting from modernization processes has left these traditional areas marginalized leading to an exodus of the population and the abandonment of part of the systems that is the loss of traditional ecological knowledge communal work and solidarities delgado anés 2017 ruiz ruiz and martín civantos 2017 the whole area was fossilized until recent years when new crops and investments arrived attracted by the altitude and the possibilities of off season production the intensive production of cherry tomatoes for example threats the historical systems due to the construction of private pools and wells for pressured irrigation many wells even inside the protected area are illegal fortunately the aquifer recharge was maintained in the acequia del espino because the older farmers were fully aware of its importance at present the situation is relatively stable the international market prices have come down and competition with other regions is greater but at the same time the irrigator community is reacting against the individual interests that threaten the common wealth irrigator communities and water management systems have also proven to be extremely resilient over the centuries 7 conclusions this study focuses on the acequias de careo as the oldest mar system in europe in the 11th century they were already operational in sierra nevada according to historical written documents records further describe the existence already in operation of the acequia de el espino in 1573 at a later date in 1805 the recharging procedure used in one of the irrigation ditches belonging to the bérchules basin was fully described in historical documents the water flowing at the recharge channel also pours into flat and highly permeable areas called simas geological and geophysical research have shown that these simas consist of an artificial sedimentary infill composed of gravel sand and silt which is closely related with the operation of the channel the dating of quartz grains embedded in the sedimentary filling material reveals that these grains were deposited between 636 a d and today the dating results largely corroborate the historical information notwithstanding key methodological questions arise when trying to establish chronologies and a sequence of human occupation and questions of a historical nature surround the origin of the acequias de careo and the development and implementation of recharge techniques by the hispano romans before 711 a d and by arabs and berbers after their invasion of the iberian peninsula this system devised by our ancestors as a tool for adapting to water scarcity could be applied in other alpine basins or high altitude basins around the world as a valuable strategy to mitigate the forecast impact of climate change the survival or improvement of this ancestral recharge system is therefore imperative the acequias de careo call for institutional support so that new research projects can be undertaken promoting global cooperation between scientists and the communities involved in ancestral recharge techniques despite the critical social situation of the small villages in the mountainous areas of study a substantial part of the irrigation system is preserved and maintained policies should be oriented toward restoration of the infrastructures and the recovery of traditional practices and knowledge in conjunction with scientific research while historical irrigation systems have demonstrated their resilience they are essential for a great variety of ecosystem services that depend on agrarian production and farmers agrarian heritage is dynamic and policies must take environmental and cultural considerations into account in addition to scientific and historical knowledge in sum agriculture should be understood as a multifunctional activity closely linked to nature and culture social cohesion and wellbeing credit authorship contribution statement s martos rosillo conceptualization methodology

6138,raindrop impact ri and groundwater seepage gws play important roles in slope erosion processes however reliable quantification of their interactive effects on erosion is still lacking therefore a laboratory study was conducted to reveal the effects of ri and gws on hillslope erosion a soil box 5 0 m long 0 5 m wide and 0 5 m deep was subjected to rainfall simulation experiments under free drainage fd and gws conditions the effect of ri was studied by dissipating raindrop energy i e without raindrop impact wri the results indicated that compared with wri ri increased the runoff rate soil loss and sediment concentration by about 3 14 74 696 and 64 560 respectively with a higher runoff rate of 27 54 gws increased soil loss and sediment concentration about 70 588 and 27 411 compared with fd respectively a power function relation were found between soil losses and runoff rate the increasing rate of soil loss increased with runoff followed the order gws ri fd ri gws wri fd wri the erosion and sediment yield seemed to be detachment limited as a result of crust formation ri compared with wri marginally enhanced the average flow velocity and shear stress and reduced the resistance coefficient the effects of gws on flow parameters were more pronounced than ri the mean weight diameter of aggregates was reduced by about 13 69 because of breakdown by raindrop impact or slaking the loss of 0 25 mm aggregate accounted for 77 98 of the total aggregate loss in all treatments keywords runoff eroded aggregate size rainfall simulation soil loss hydraulic parameters 1 introduction soil erosion causes severe soil degradation and reduces crop productivity in the agricultural regions pierce et al 1983 pimentel et al 1995 for example in the chernozem region of northeast china the top layer has high organic matter content and crop productivity xing et al 2004 however the topsoil thickness of chernozem decreased from 50 to 80 cm in the 1950 s to 20 40 cm in the 2000 s due to severe soil erosion mwr et al 2010 the fertile topsoil loss has led to a 14 reduction of crop yield in the chinese chernozem region liu and yan 2009 raindrop impact ri that detaches and sheet flow that transports soil particles are the main processes causing soil erosion at the slope scales sharma et al 1995 ri can break the bonds holding the soil particles and provide loose soil particles that can be transported by overland flow morin et al 1981 furthermore the raindrop impact breaks down macro aggregates which may seal the soil surface by compacting and clogging the pores resulting in lower infiltration and more runoff ela et al 1992 in addition raindrop impact influences the turbulence intensity and changes the detachment and transporting capacity of the sheet flow on a slope surface which increases hillslope soil loss wang et al 2018 raindrop impact therefore plays an important role in both detachment and transport of soil particles in interrill soil erosion young and wiersma 1973 numerous studies have been conducted on the effect of ri on soil erosion under free drainage fd conditions some researchers confirmed that the raindrop impact has a limited effect on transport of soil particles under fd condition moss et al 1979 kinnell 1991 on the contrary other studies report that raindrop impact can increase the turbulence intensity of the runoff and result in an increased transport capacity for soil particles guy et al 1987 dunne and zhang 1991 in addition to rainfall intensity the effects of raindrop impact on detachment and transport capacity of sheet flow were influenced by the depth of sheet flow moss and green 1983 when ri was eliminated the total soil loss as well as rill erosion was considerably reduced due to less runoff on interrill erosion areas as a result of reduced seal formation meyer and foster 1975 zhang and miller 1996 once ri was reduced through a nylon net cover above the soil surfaces soil loss was reduced by 50 90 depending on topography soil types and the rate of rainfall kinetic energy removal young and wiersma 1973 meyer and foster 1975 zheng et al 2004b an et al 2012 lu et al 2016 near surface hydrological conditions such as groundwater seepage gws which is the shallow ground water that is exfiltrated at the soil surface are another key factor that influence hillslope soil erosion huang 1998 the gws zone is limited along the hillslope generally in the bottom as compared to the fd zone zheng et al 2004a the gws could reduce the cohesive force of top soil and thus enhance soil erosion howard and mclane 1988 dunne 1990 under a fd condition the soil is unsaturated more rainfall water may infiltrate into the soil huang et al 2002 but under the gws condition the soil is saturated almost all of the rainfall water turns into the surface flow leading to an obvious increase of erosion huang and laflen 1996 zheng et al 2004a furthermore the type of soil erosion may change from detachment limited under the fd condition to transport limited under the gws condition zheng et al 2000 however the effects of ri on sediment transport capacity under the gws condition remain unclear therefore the objectives of this study were i to identify and compare the effects of ri on sediment transport capacity under both fd and gws conditions ii to quantify the influence of ri and gws on hillslope erosion and eroded aggregate size these research findings can help to understand hillslope erosion mechanisms in order to improve current conservation measures and protect soil resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup in the chernozem region of northeast china most subsoils are silty derived from loess feng et al 2018 and therefore prone to crusting le bissonnais et al 1989 after a long time farming the subsoils have developed a compacted plow pan with a low permeability larney and kladivko 1989 gollany et al 2005 therefore summer rainstorms can easily cause surface and subsurface flow that exfiltrates downhill i e groundwater seepage gws gabbard et al 1998 in addition in early spring the snow melt water in top soil also generates the gws conditions zheng et al 2000 wu et al 2018 the soil used in the experiments was collected from the upper 20 cm cultivated layer in the field located in liujia 44 43 n 126 11 e jilin province the chernozem fao 2015 has a typical silt loam texture with 20 3 clay 0 002 mm 76 4 silt 0 05 0 002 mm 3 3 sand 0 05 2 mm and 2 4 organic matter the rainfall simulation experiments were conducted at the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau in yangling china a side sprinkler rainfall simulator system was used the fall height of raindrops was 16 m above the ground two rainfall intensities 50 and 100 mm h 1 with corresponding kinetic energy 13 99 and 27 89 j m 2 mm 1 which represent extremely heavy rainfall events in the chernozem region of northeast china zhang and zhai 2011 shen et al 2014 were used in this study the diameter and velocity of each raindrops were measured by using a thies clima laser precipitation monitor lpm adolf thies gmbh co kg 2011 the kinetic energy of rainfall

electrical conductivity of 4 95 ds m 1 the experiments were conducted in a 5 0 m long 0 5 m wide and 0 5 m deep box with holes 2 cm aperture at the bottom to facilitate drainage fig 1 a water supply system was used to supply water to the box from the bottom to control the near surface hydraulic condition huang 1998 the gws condition was created with the supply water level set 20 cm above the soil surface zheng et al 2004a the gws was supplied at a flow rate of 7 9 mm h 1 during the whole rainfall event for the fd treatment the box was drained freely under gravity the boxes were set at a 2 5 and 5 slope typical gradients of slope cropland in the chernozem region of northeast china to investigate the effects of ri on soil erosion two treatments with and without ri were designed the soil of the former treatment received raindrops impact directly the soil of latter was covered by a nylon net 1 mm aperture placed 10 cm above the box which reduced the raindrop kinetic energy by 64 0 99 6 young and wiersma 1973 zheng et al 1995 mugler et al 2019 thirty two tests were conducted including two rainfall intensities two slope gradients two near surface hydraulic conditions fd and gws two cover conditions and two replications for each treatment 2 2 experimental procedures firstly a 10 cm thick layer of sand was packed at the bottom of the box which allowed fd of excessive water then a 20 cm chernozem layer simulated plow pan with a bulk density of 1 35 g cm 3 was packed above the sand layer finally another 20 cm chernozem layer simulating the tillage layer with a bulk density of 1 20 g cm 3 was packed in addition to reduce the discontinuity between two packed layers the surface of each layer was gently scored during packing after packing the soil layers were pre wetted with gentle rainfall 25 mm h 1 to about 20 water content at 0 slope during rainfall simulation experiments runoff and sediment were collected in plastic containers at 5 min intervals over a 30 minute period these samples were weighed and the suspended sediment was allowed to settle the clear supernatant was decanted and the remaining sediment was oven dried at 105 c for 24 h to determine the soil loss and calculate the sediment concentration surface flow velocity was measured over the whole length of the box at 5 min intervals using a dye tracing method with 0 8 w w kmno4 the runoff which was collected to investigate aggregate loss was immediately processed through a set of sieves with apertures of 2 1 0 5 and 0 25 mm after sieving the sieved aggregates were oven dried to calculate the soil aggregate loss and aggregate size distribution 2 3 data processing the mean flow velocity was calculated by the following formula 2 v k v m where v is the mean flow velocity m s 1 k is a coefficient of 0 75 xiao et al 2011 v m is the measured flow velocity using the dye method shear stress of flow τ was calculated by the following formula foster et al 1984 3 τ γ r j where γ is the gravity of water n m 3 r is hydraulic radius m j is the sine surface slope gradient m m 1 the darcy weisbach friction coefficient f was used to characterize the retardation of flow and was calculated

weight proportion of class i in the total mass of the sample statistical analysis was performed using spss version 19 0 spss inc two way analysis of variance anova was conducted to examine the effects of gws ri and their interactions on runoff rates soil loss rates and sediment concentrations the method of independent samples t test was used to test the significant difference in runoff rate soil loss sediment concentration different flow hydraulic parameters and aggregate size distribution among tests with and without raindrop impact under different rainfall intensity slope gradient and near surface hydraulic conditions 3 results 3 1 runoff and sediment during the whole experiment only sheet erosion occurred and no rills developed the average runoff rate was between 37 2 and 59 7 mm h 1 and 68 6 116 5 mm h 1 under 50 and 100 mm h 1 rainfall intensity respectively fig 2 the latter was about two times of the former meanwhile under the same near surface hydraulic and screen cover conditions the average soil loss for 100 mm h 1 rainfall was about 2 5 5 times more than for 50 mm h 1 the runoff rate was 1 1 times higher at 5 slope than at 2 5 however the average soil loss was 37 9 2057 9 g m 2 at 5 0 slope gradients which was 2 times more than that of 17 0 978 2 g m 2 at 2 5 the effects of ri on runoff rate was not significant but the effect on sediment delivery rate and sediment concentration was significant p 0 05 table 1 the effects of gws on both runoff and sediment was significant however the effects of the interaction of ri and as on both runoff and sediment was not significant table 1 ri increased the runoff rate soil loss and sediment concentration by about 3 14 74 696 and 64 560 respectively fig 3 compared to fd condition gws increased runoff rate soil loss and sediment concentration by 27 54 70 588 and 27 411 respectively although gws had a larger effect on the runoff rate than ri it had a weaker or similar impact on soil losses and sediment concentrations 3 2 erosion processes fig 4 shows that runoff and soil losses increased within the first 10 15 min and then stabilized near the end of rainfall for all the tests for the tests on 5 slope the runoff rate was very similar to that on 2 5 slope at the same time period the ri also affected the runoff rate slightly for all the tests for most of the time period the ri increased the runoff rate the runoff rate in the tests with 100 mm h 1 rainfall intensity was much larger than that under 50 mm h 1 and in the tests with gws was much larger than the tests with fd thus both rainfall intensity and seepage could increase runoff rate obviously due to the lower infiltration rate of them table 2 during the erosion processes the soil loss in the tests on 5 slope were greater than that on 2 5 slope fig 4 especially in the tests of gws ri 50 fd ri 100 and gws ri 100 in which soil losses were more than two times larger on the 5 than 2 5 slope at the same time period meanwhile the tests with ri or under gws had much greater soil loss than that without ri or under fd respectively thus ri and gws could increase soil loss obviously fig 5 shows that the soil loss increased with runoff rate in the tests with and without ri ri or wri for both gws and fd conditions a power function relation r2 0 73 can describe the relation between soil loss and runoff rate the fitting relationships showed that the soil loss increased in following order gws ri fd ri gws wri fd wri 3 3 flow hydraulic parameters the average flow velocities in all experimental cases were between 2 1 and 4 4 cm s 1 fig 6 the average flow shear stresses and resistance coefficients for all tests were 1 43 3 18 pa and 13 42 respectively fig 6 compared with the tests covered by the nylon screen the ri increased the calculated average flow velocity and shear stress by 5 13 and 4 respectively fig 7 a meanwhile the ri decreased the resistance coefficient by 1 19 fig 7a compared with the tests under fd condition a gws increased the flow velocity and shear stress by 19 33 and 8 16 respectively fig 7b and it reduced resistance coefficients by 22 37 fig 7b 3 4 aggregates size distribution table 3 shows the size distribution of aggregates in the sediment collected at the outlet the aggregate percentages for the sediment smaller than 0 25 mm were larger than that of the tested soil because larger aggregates were broken down during raindrop impact and runoff detachment for the tested soil most of the fine particles were disaggregated from the groups of 0 25 0 5 mm and 0 5 1 0 mm the loss of 0 25 mm aggregates accounted for 77 98 of the total aggregate loss the mwd of aggregates was reduced in the processes by about 13 69 for the same experimental conditions the tests with larger rainfall intensities or slope gradient had more fine aggregates table 3 meanwhile the tests with ri resulted in a larger loss of 0 25 mm aggregates than that without ri this indicates that the tests with ri could breakdown more macroaggregates the tests under gws condition also led to a larger loss of 0 25 mm aggregates than that under fd condition it means gws also contributed to disaggregation 4 discussions 4 1 effects of ri on hillslope soil erosion ri increased runoff rate fig 3 which may be attributed to the surface crust formation due to ri zhang and miller 1996 raindrop impact can physically breakdown soil aggregates and cause crust formation since the surface crust has a much lower saturated hydraulic conductivity than the un crusted soil below zhang and miller 1996 chen et al 2013 crust formation increases surface runoff rate fig 3 and therefore flow velocity and shear stress fig 5 ri increased the sediment delivery rate due to several possible reasons firstly the raindrops can break down the aggregates of surface soil by slaking and mechanical breakdown xiao et al 2017a 2018 which provided abundant eroded materials especially much more easily transported finer particles table 3 to be carried by runoff kinnell 2005 splash erosion caused by raindrop impact detaches soil particles aggregates from the soil matrix and provided loose materials for sheet flow transport which would increase soil loss in a detachment limited erosion regime secondly the greater flow shear stress fig 7 due to increased runoff has more energy to transport sediment particles xiao et al 2017b which increases sediment delivery in a transport limited regime thirdly sediment transport capacity is greatly enhanced by raindrop impact due to increased turbulence and stimulation guy et al 1987 zhang and wang 2017 conversely in the treatment of wri the nylon net above the box reduced the raindrop kinetic energy by 64 0 99 6 young and wiersma 1973 zheng et al 1995 mugler et al 2019 thus soil detachment and sediment transport was mainly caused by sheet flow energy kinnell 1991 as discussed earlier in interrill erosion raindrop impact plays an important role in both detaching soil and enhancing sediment transport of sheet flow zhang et al 2018 without ri both detachment and transport were greatly reduced the runoff energy without ri had a limited effect on disaggregation of surface soil especially when the soil has a relatively high clay content silburn and foley 1994 so soil detachment was limited in the treatment of wri resulting in the lower soil loss than that in the treatment of ri the increase rate of soil loss and sediment concentration due to ri under the gws condition was much less than that under the fd condition fig 3 that may be ascribed to the weaker mechanical breakdown of soil aggregates in as because a greater water depth reduces the raindrop kinetic energy moss and green 1983 hu et al 2018 4 2 effects of gws on hillslope soil erosion the runoff for the gws condition was higher compared with fd condition due to the addition of seepage figs 2 and 3 the gws increased soil loss and sediment concentration could be attributed to three possible reasons firstly the positive soil pore water pressure at or near the soil surface under the gws condition reduced soil cohesion and greatly enhanced soil detachment gabbard et al 1998 huang 1998 howard and mclane 1988 which greatly increased soil loss under detachment limited conditions secondly soil aggregates can be broken down and transported with greater runoff which produces higher flow velocity and shear stress figs 6 and 7 thirdly the higher water content under gws closer to saturation result in more slaking of soil aggregates le bissonnais and arrouays 1997 soil loss and sediment concentrations increased under ri over those of wri fig 3 for both gws and fd conditions because ri significantly increased soil detachment indicating that soil detachment was the limiting process for the soil under the study conditions the greater increase under fd than under gws further substantiated the detachment limited case because gws promoted soil detachment due to positive soil water pressure gws increased soil loss and sediment concentrations over fd for both ri and wri conditions due to increased soil detachment the greater increases under wri than under ri fig 3 was because ri already increased soil detachment under free drainage overall the results seem to indicate that soil detachment might be the limiting process for all cases except for the gws ri case in which the limiting process was indeterminable under the study conditions in that either process could be limiting total soil loss fig 3 shows that soil losses increased as runoff rates increased for all tested cases the rates of the increases followed the order of gws ri fd ri gws wri fd wri again indicating detachment limiting regimes for most cases 4 3 flow hydraulic parameters fig 7 showed that ri could increase average flow velocity slightly over wri beuselinck et al 2002 also found that ri had a limited influence on the flow velocity the limited influence could be ascribed to absorption of raindrop energy in very shallow flows by sediment and flume surface guy et al 1990 furthermore raindrops breakdown aggregates which release fine particles that clog soil pores for infiltration ela et al 1992 then accelerate the formation of a smooth crust with decreased surface roughness which is a typical erosion crust kinnell 1990 zhang and miller 1996 le bissonnais and arrouays 1997 this might be the main reason why the resistance coefficients in the treatment of ri decreased fig 7 4 4 aggregate size distribution the majority of lost aggregates were in size of 0 25 mm table 3 its dominant contribution might be attributed to the fact that the fine particles were more easily transported than coarse particles by surface runoff govers 1985 on the other hand the runoff transportation capacity on the gentle slope such as here was limited which was not sufficient to transport larger macro aggregates sutherland et al 1996 this indicates the existence of transport selectivity in the erosion process rainfall intensity played an important role in disintegrating soil aggregates greater rainfall intensity with greater kinetic impact energy caused more aggregate breakdown young and wiersma 1973 and therefore resulted in higher percentage loss of micro aggregates 0 25 mm in runoff table 3 the aggregate breakdown by raindrop impact seemed to be greater under fd than under gws this could be caused by the increased aggregate breakdown by slaking in the gws treatment where water content was higher and wetting was faster aggregate breakdown by slaking might have discounted the breakdown by raindrop impact under gws 5 conclusions in this study both rainfall intensity and slope gradient have a greater impact on sediment transport than on runoff for the slope with chernozem ri increased runoff soil losses and sediment concentrations by about 3 14 74 696 and 64 560 respectively compared with the fd condition gws increased runoff soil losses and sediment concentrations by 27 54 70 588 and 27 411 respectively both ri and slope gradient had a small effect on runoff rate and both rainfall intensity and gws increased runoff rate obviously however rainfall intensity slope gradient ri and gws increased soil loss substantially power function relations were found between soil loss and runoff rate the fitting relationships showed that the increasing rate of soil loss in different treatments followed the order gws ri fd ri gws wri fd wri indicating that erosion of the slope was detachment limited for most cases ri slightly increased the average flow velocity and shear stress of the runoff and decreased the resistance coefficient due to the formation of a smooth crust that increased runoff and decreased surface roughness however the gws had a larger effect on the flow hydraulic parameters simply due to the added runoff by seepage the loss of 0 25 mm aggregates accounted for 77 98 of the total aggregate loss the mwd of aggregates was reduced in the processes by about 13 69 due to aggregate breakdown by raindrop impact and or slaking as a result the tests with larger rainfall intensity or slope gradient had much more finer aggregates as well as the tests with ri or gws had more loss of 0 25 mm aggregates than that without ri or with fd our results not only can help to understand hillslope erosion mechanisms to improve the prediction models but also give some hints for soil conservation practices increasing the ground cover would be effective in reducing kinetic energy of raindrops and to a lesser extent runoff under a storm of high rainfall intensity similar to those typically found in the region the finding that runoff would occur to a great extent from the plots with gws suggests that drainage systems need to be designed to reduce runoff and help to shorten the time of soil dry out declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

soil loss and sediment concentration by about 3 14 74 696 and 64 560 respectively with a higher runoff rate of 27 54 gws increased soil loss and sediment concentration about 70 588 and 27 411 compared with fd respectively a power function relation were found between soil losses and runoff rate the increasing rate of soil loss increased with runoff followed the order gws ri fd ri gws wri fd wri the erosion and sediment yield seemed to be detachment limited as a result of crust formation ri compared with wri marginally enhanced the average flow velocity and shear stress and reduced the resistance coefficient the effects of gws on flow parameters were more pronounced than ri the mean weight diameter of aggregates was reduced by about 13 69 because of breakdown by raindrop impact or slaking the loss of 0 25 mm aggregate accounted for 77 98 of the total aggregate loss in all treatments keywords runoff eroded aggregate size rainfall simulation soil loss hydraulic parameters 1 introduction soil erosion causes severe soil degradation and reduces crop productivity in the agricultural regions pierce et al 1983 pimentel et al 1995 for example in the chernozem region of northeast china the top layer has high organic matter content and crop productivity xing et al 2004 however the topsoil thickness of chernozem decreased from 50 to 80 cm in the 1950 s to 20 40 cm in the 2000 s due to severe soil erosion mwr et al 2010 the fertile topsoil loss has led to a 14 reduction of crop yield in the chinese chernozem region liu and yan 2009 raindrop impact ri that detaches and sheet flow that transports soil particles are the main processes causing soil erosion at the slope scales sharma et al 1995 ri can break the bonds holding the soil particles and provide loose soil particles that can be transported by overland flow morin et al 1981 furthermore the raindrop impact breaks down macro aggregates which may seal the soil surface by compacting and clogging the pores resulting in lower infiltration and more runoff ela et al 1992 in addition raindrop impact influences the turbulence intensity and changes the detachment and transporting capacity of the sheet flow on a slope surface which increases hillslope soil loss wang et al 2018 raindrop impact therefore plays an important role in both detachment and transport of soil particles in interrill soil erosion young and wiersma 1973 numerous studies have been conducted on the effect of ri on soil erosion under free drainage fd conditions some researchers confirmed that the raindrop impact has a limited effect on transport of soil particles under fd condition moss et al 1979 kinnell 1991 on the contrary other studies report that raindrop impact can increase the turbulence intensity of the runoff and result in an increased transport capacity for soil particles guy et al 1987 dunne and zhang 1991 in addition to rainfall intensity the effects of raindrop impact on detachment and transport capacity of sheet flow were influenced by the depth of sheet flow moss and green 1983 when ri was eliminated the total soil loss as well as rill erosion was considerably reduced due to less runoff on interrill erosion areas as a result of reduced seal formation meyer and foster 1975 zhang and miller 1996 once ri was reduced through a nylon net cover above the soil surfaces soil loss was reduced by 50 90 depending on topography soil types and the rate of rainfall kinetic energy removal young and wiersma 1973 meyer and foster 1975 zheng et al 2004b an et al 2012 lu et al 2016 near surface hydrological conditions such as groundwater seepage gws which is the shallow ground water that is exfiltrated at the soil surface are another key factor that influence hillslope soil erosion huang 1998 the gws zone is limited along the hillslope generally in the bottom as compared to the fd zone zheng et al 2004a the gws could reduce the cohesive force of top soil and thus enhance soil erosion howard and mclane 1988 dunne 1990 under a fd condition the soil is unsaturated more rainfall water may infiltrate into the soil huang et al 2002 but under the gws condition the soil is saturated almost all of the rainfall water turns into the surface flow leading to an obvious increase of erosion huang and laflen 1996 zheng et al 2004a furthermore the type of soil erosion may change from detachment limited under the fd condition to transport limited under the gws condition zheng et al 2000 however the effects of ri on sediment transport capacity under the gws condition remain unclear therefore the objectives of this study were i to identify and compare the effects of ri on sediment transport capacity under both fd and gws conditions ii to quantify the influence of ri and gws on hillslope erosion and eroded aggregate size these research findings can help to understand hillslope erosion mechanisms in order to improve current conservation measures and protect soil resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup in the chernozem region of northeast china most subsoils are silty derived from loess feng et al 2018 and therefore prone to crusting le bissonnais et al 1989 after a long time farming the subsoils have developed a compacted plow pan with a low permeability larney and kladivko 1989 gollany et al 2005 therefore summer rainstorms can easily cause surface and subsurface flow that exfiltrates downhill i e groundwater seepage gws gabbard et al 1998 in addition in early spring the snow melt water in top soil also generates the gws conditions zheng et al 2000 wu et al 2018 the soil used in the experiments was collected from the upper 20 cm cultivated layer in the field located in liujia 44 43 n 126 11 e jilin province the chernozem fao 2015 has a typical silt loam texture with 20 3 clay 0 002 mm 76 4 silt 0 05 0 002 mm 3 3 sand 0 05 2 mm and 2 4 organic matter the rainfall simulation experiments were conducted at the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau in yangling china a side sprinkler rainfall simulator system was used the fall height of raindrops was 16 m above the ground two rainfall intensities 50 and 100 mm h 1 with corresponding kinetic energy 13 99 and 27 89 j m 2 mm 1 which represent extremely heavy rainfall events in the chernozem region of northeast china zhang and zhai 2011 shen et al 2014 were used in this study the diameter and velocity of each raindrops were measured by using a thies clima laser precipitation monitor lpm adolf thies gmbh co kg 2011 the kinetic energy of rainfall

electrical conductivity of 4 95 ds m 1 the experiments were conducted in a 5 0 m long 0 5 m wide and 0 5 m deep box with holes 2 cm aperture at the bottom to facilitate drainage fig 1 a water supply system was used to supply water to the box from the bottom to control the near surface hydraulic condition huang 1998 the gws condition was created with the supply water level set 20 cm above the soil surface zheng et al 2004a the gws was supplied at a flow rate of 7 9 mm h 1 during the whole rainfall event for the fd treatment the box was drained freely under gravity the boxes were set at a 2 5 and 5 slope typical gradients of slope cropland in the chernozem region of northeast china to investigate the effects of ri on soil erosion two treatments with and without ri were designed the soil of the former treatment received raindrops impact directly the soil of latter was covered by a nylon net 1 mm aperture placed 10 cm above the box which reduced the raindrop kinetic energy by 64 0 99 6 young and wiersma 1973 zheng et al 1995 mugler et al 2019 thirty two tests were conducted including two rainfall intensities two slope gradients two near surface hydraulic conditions fd and gws two cover conditions and two replications for each treatment 2 2 experimental procedures firstly a 10 cm thick layer of sand was packed at the bottom of the box which allowed fd of excessive water then a 20 cm chernozem layer simulated plow pan with a bulk density of 1 35 g cm 3 was packed above the sand layer finally another 20 cm chernozem layer simulating the tillage layer with a bulk density of 1 20 g cm 3 was packed in addition to reduce the discontinuity between two packed layers the surface of each layer was gently scored during packing after packing the soil layers were pre wetted with gentle rainfall 25 mm h 1 to about 20 water content at 0 slope during rainfall simulation experiments runoff and sediment were collected in plastic containers at 5 min intervals over a 30 minute period these samples were weighed and the suspended sediment was allowed to settle the clear supernatant was decanted and the remaining sediment was oven dried at 105 c for 24 h to determine the soil loss and calculate the sediment concentration surface flow velocity was measured over the whole length of the box at 5 min intervals using a dye tracing method with 0 8 w w kmno4 the runoff which was collected to investigate aggregate loss was immediately processed through a set of sieves with apertures of 2 1 0 5 and 0 25 mm after sieving the sieved aggregates were oven dried to calculate the soil aggregate loss and aggregate size distribution 2 3 data processing the mean flow velocity was calculated by the following formula 2 v k v m where v is the mean flow velocity m s 1 k is a coefficient of 0 75 xiao et al 2011 v m is the measured flow velocity using the dye method shear stress of flow τ was calculated by the following formula foster et al 1984 3 τ γ r j where γ is the gravity of water n m 3 r is hydraulic radius m j is the sine surface slope gradient m m 1 the darcy weisbach friction coefficient f was used to characterize the retardation of flow and was calculated as liu et al 2010 4 f 8 g r j v 2 the mean weight diameter mwd of water stable aggregates was calculated as hillel 2004 5 mwd i 1 n x i w i where xi is the mean diameter of the class i mm wi is the weight proportion of class i in the total mass of the sample statistical analysis was performed using spss version 19 0 spss inc two way analysis of variance anova was conducted to examine the effects of gws ri and their interactions on runoff rates soil loss rates and sediment concentrations the method of independent samples t test was used to test the significant difference in runoff rate soil loss sediment concentration different flow hydraulic parameters and aggregate size distribution among tests with and without raindrop impact under different rainfall intensity slope gradient and near surface hydraulic conditions 3 results 3 1 runoff and sediment during the whole experiment only sheet erosion occurred and no rills developed the average runoff rate was between 37 2 and 59 7 mm h 1 and 68 6 116 5 mm h 1 under 50 and 100 mm h 1 rainfall intensity respectively fig 2 the latter was about two times of the former meanwhile under the same near surface hydraulic and screen cover conditions the average soil loss for 100 mm h 1 rainfall was about 2 5 5 times more than for 50 mm h 1 the runoff rate was 1 1 times higher at 5 slope than at 2 5 however the average soil loss was 37 9 2057 9 g m 2 at 5 0 slope gradients which was 2 times more than that of 17 0 978 2 g m 2 at 2 5 the effects of ri on runoff rate was not significant but the effect on sediment delivery rate and sediment concentration was significant p 0 05 table 1 the effects of gws on both runoff and sediment was significant however the effects of the interaction of ri and as on both runoff and sediment was not significant table 1 ri increased the runoff rate soil loss and sediment concentration by about 3 14 74 696 and 64 560 respectively fig 3 compared to fd condition gws increased runoff rate soil loss and sediment concentration by 27 54 70 588 and 27 411 respectively although gws had a larger effect on the runoff rate than ri it had a weaker or similar impact on soil losses and sediment concentrations 3 2 erosion processes fig 4 shows that runoff and soil losses increased within the first 10 15 min and then stabilized near the end of rainfall for all the tests for the tests on 5 slope the runoff rate was very similar to that on 2 5 slope at the same time period the ri also affected the runoff rate slightly for all the tests for most of the time period the ri increased the runoff rate the runoff rate in the tests with 100 mm h 1 rainfall intensity was much larger than that under 50 mm h 1 and in the tests with gws was much larger than the tests with fd thus both rainfall intensity and seepage could increase runoff rate obviously due to the lower infiltration rate of them table 2 during the erosion processes the soil loss in the tests on 5 slope were greater than that on 2 5 slope fig 4 especially in the tests of gws ri 50 fd ri 100 and gws ri 100 in which soil losses were more than two times larger on the 5 than 2 5 slope at the same time period meanwhile the tests with ri or under gws had much greater soil loss than that without ri or under fd respectively thus ri and gws could increase soil loss obviously fig 5 shows that the soil loss increased with runoff rate in the tests with and without ri ri or wri for both gws and fd conditions a power function relation r2 0 73 can describe the relation between soil loss and runoff rate the fitting relationships showed that the soil loss increased in following order gws ri fd ri gws wri fd wri 3 3 flow hydraulic parameters the average flow velocities in all experimental cases were between 2 1 and 4 4 cm s 1 fig 6 the average flow shear stresses and resistance coefficients for all tests were 1 43 3 18 pa and 13 42 respectively fig 6 compared with the tests covered by the nylon screen the ri increased the calculated average flow velocity and shear stress by 5 13 and 4 respectively fig 7 a meanwhile the ri decreased the resistance coefficient by 1 19 fig 7a compared with the tests under fd condition a gws increased the flow velocity and shear stress by 19 33 and 8 16 respectively fig 7b and it reduced resistance coefficients by 22 37 fig 7b 3 4 aggregates size distribution table 3 shows the size distribution of aggregates in the sediment collected at the outlet the aggregate percentages for the sediment smaller than 0 25 mm were larger than that of the tested soil because larger aggregates were broken down during raindrop impact and runoff detachment for the tested soil most of the fine particles were disaggregated from the groups of 0 25 0 5 mm and 0 5 1 0 mm the loss of 0 25 mm aggregates accounted for 77 98 of the total aggregate loss the mwd of aggregates was reduced in the processes by about 13 69 for the same experimental conditions the tests with larger rainfall intensities or slope gradient had more fine aggregates table 3 meanwhile the tests with ri resulted in a larger loss of 0 25 mm aggregates than that without ri this indicates that the tests with ri could breakdown more macroaggregates the tests under gws condition also led to a larger loss of 0 25 mm aggregates than that under fd condition it means gws also contributed to disaggregation 4 discussions 4 1 effects of ri on hillslope soil erosion ri increased runoff rate fig 3 which may be attributed to the surface crust formation due to ri zhang and miller 1996 raindrop impact can physically breakdown soil aggregates and cause crust formation since the surface crust has a much lower saturated hydraulic conductivity than the un crusted soil below zhang and miller 1996 chen et al 2013 crust formation increases surface runoff rate fig 3 and therefore flow velocity and shear stress fig 5 ri increased the sediment delivery rate due to several possible reasons firstly the raindrops can break down the aggregates of surface soil by slaking and mechanical breakdown xiao et al 2017a 2018 which provided abundant eroded materials especially much more easily transported finer particles table 3 to be carried by runoff kinnell 2005 splash erosion caused by raindrop impact detaches soil particles aggregates from the soil matrix and provided loose materials for sheet flow transport which would increase soil loss in a detachment limited erosion regime secondly the greater flow shear stress fig 7 due to increased runoff has more energy to transport sediment particles xiao et al 2017b which increases sediment delivery in a transport limited regime thirdly sediment transport capacity is greatly enhanced by raindrop impact due to increased turbulence and stimulation guy et al 1987 zhang and wang 2017 conversely in the treatment of wri the nylon net above the box reduced the raindrop kinetic energy by 64 0 99 6 young and wiersma 1973 zheng et al 1995 mugler et al 2019 thus soil detachment and sediment transport was mainly caused by sheet flow energy kinnell 1991 as discussed earlier in interrill erosion raindrop impact plays an important role in both detaching soil and enhancing sediment transport of sheet flow zhang et al 2018 without ri both detachment and transport were greatly reduced the runoff energy without ri had a limited effect on disaggregation of surface soil especially when the soil has a relatively high clay content silburn and foley 1994 so soil detachment was limited in the treatment of wri resulting in the lower soil loss than that in the treatment of ri the increase rate of soil loss and sediment concentration due to ri under the gws condition was much less than that under the fd condition fig 3 that may be ascribed to the weaker mechanical breakdown of soil aggregates in as because a greater water depth reduces the raindrop kinetic energy moss and green 1983 hu et al 2018 4 2 effects of gws on hillslope soil erosion the runoff for the gws condition was higher compared with fd condition due to the addition of seepage figs 2 and 3 the gws increased soil loss and sediment concentration could be attributed to three possible reasons firstly the positive soil pore water pressure at or near the soil surface under the gws condition reduced soil cohesion and greatly enhanced soil detachment gabbard et al 1998 huang 1998 howard and mclane 1988 which greatly increased soil loss under detachment limited conditions secondly soil aggregates can be broken down and transported with greater runoff which produces higher flow velocity and shear stress figs 6 and 7 thirdly the higher water content under gws closer to saturation result in more slaking of soil aggregates le bissonnais and arrouays 1997 soil loss and sediment concentrations increased under ri over those of wri fig 3 for both gws and fd conditions because ri significantly increased soil detachment indicating that soil detachment was the limiting process for the soil under the study conditions the greater increase under fd than under gws further substantiated the detachment limited case because gws promoted soil detachment due to positive soil water pressure gws increased soil loss and sediment concentrations over fd for both ri and wri conditions due to increased soil detachment the greater increases under wri than under ri fig 3 was because ri already increased soil detachment under free drainage overall the results seem to indicate that soil detachment might be the limiting process for all cases except for the gws ri case in which the limiting process was indeterminable under the study conditions in that either process could be limiting total soil loss fig 3 shows that soil losses increased as runoff rates increased for all tested cases the rates of the increases followed the order of gws ri fd ri gws wri fd wri again indicating detachment limiting regimes for most cases 4 3 flow hydraulic parameters fig 7 showed that ri could increase average flow velocity slightly over wri beuselinck et al 2002 also found that ri had a limited influence on the flow velocity the limited influence could be ascribed to absorption of raindrop energy in very shallow flows by sediment and flume surface guy et al 1990 furthermore raindrops breakdown aggregates which release fine particles that clog soil pores for infiltration ela et al 1992 then accelerate the formation of a smooth crust with decreased surface roughness which is a typical erosion crust kinnell 1990 zhang and miller 1996 le bissonnais and arrouays 1997 this might be the main reason why the resistance coefficients in the treatment of ri decreased fig 7 4 4 aggregate size distribution the majority of lost aggregates were in size of 0 25 mm table 3 its dominant contribution might be attributed to the fact that the fine particles were more easily transported than coarse particles by surface runoff govers 1985 on the other hand the runoff transportation capacity on the gentle slope such as here was limited which was not sufficient to transport larger macro aggregates sutherland et al 1996 this indicates the existence of transport selectivity in the erosion process rainfall intensity played an important role in disintegrating soil aggregates greater rainfall intensity with greater kinetic impact energy caused more aggregate breakdown young and wiersma 1973 and therefore resulted in higher percentage loss of micro aggregates 0 25 mm in runoff table 3 the aggregate breakdown by raindrop impact seemed to be greater under fd than under gws this could be caused by the increased aggregate breakdown by slaking in the gws treatment where water content was higher and wetting was faster aggregate breakdown by slaking might have discounted the breakdown by raindrop impact under gws 5 conclusions in this study both rainfall intensity and slope gradient have a greater impact on sediment transport than on runoff for the slope with chernozem ri increased runoff soil losses and sediment concentrations by about 3 14 74 696 and 64 560 respectively compared with the fd condition gws increased runoff soil losses and sediment concentrations by 27 54 70 588 and 27 411 respectively both ri and slope gradient had a small effect on runoff rate and both rainfall intensity and gws increased runoff rate obviously however rainfall intensity slope gradient ri and gws increased soil loss substantially power function relations were found between soil loss and runoff rate the fitting relationships showed that the increasing rate of soil loss in different treatments followed the order gws ri fd ri gws wri fd wri indicating that erosion of the slope was detachment limited for most cases ri slightly increased the average flow velocity and shear stress of the runoff and decreased the resistance coefficient due to the formation of a smooth crust that increased runoff and decreased surface roughness however the gws had a larger effect on the flow hydraulic parameters simply due to the added runoff by seepage the loss of 0 25 mm aggregates accounted for 77 98 of the total aggregate loss the mwd of aggregates was reduced in the processes by about 13 69 due to aggregate breakdown by raindrop impact and or slaking as a result the tests with larger rainfall intensity or slope gradient had much more finer aggregates as well as the tests with ri or gws had more loss of 0 25 mm aggregates than that without ri or with fd our results not only can help to understand hillslope erosion mechanisms to improve the prediction models but also give some hints for soil conservation practices increasing the ground cover would be effective in reducing kinetic energy of raindrops and to a lesser extent runoff under a storm of high rainfall intensity similar to those typically found in the region the finding that runoff would occur to a great extent from the plots with gws suggests that drainage systems need to be designed to reduce runoff and help to shorten the time of soil dry out declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

discharge sgd has received increased attention in recent years since it was recognized that it may be both volumetrically and chemically important around the mediterranean sea 60 of the coastline is composed of karstic aquifers and to properly estimate the hydrological budget of the mediterranean sea it is therefore necessary to better assess the karstic submarine groundwater discharges ksgd however quantifying ksgd is still challenging among the methods recently developed to detect and quantify sgd the mass balance method of the radium quartet 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra has proved to be a powerful technique this approach requires characterizing all the contributing terms and sinks in the coastal water volume affected by sgd the residence time of coastal waters as well as a representative concentration of the tracers for both surface water and discharging groundwater in this study we combine several approaches 223ra 224ra salinity profiles and acoustic doppler current profiler adcp measurements to examine both the accuracy and sensitivity of the radium mass balance method in the case of the cove of port miou mediterranean sea france where the main karstic spring discharges locally at 10 m depth this study benefits from the inland in situ access to the main karst conduit discharging to the sea which provides a long time series to characterize the brackish submarine groundwater end member we show that the composition of the cove water is stratified with two water bodies a surface brackish layer and a deeper layer the mean ksgd value obtained with 223ra and 224ra mass balances in the surface water body is precise but significantly lower 0 6 0 1 m3 s than the karstic spring discharge 4 1 m3 s estimated within the karst conduit with pressure sensors the residence time of the cove water estimated using both 224ra and 223ra isotopes is very low 1 1 day our study shows that the water residence time that we calculated using the ra mass balance is the key parameter that may impact ksgd in addition based on adcp transects we suggest that the shape and geometry of the cove as well as the location of the discharge point of the spring play a key role in explaining these discrepant results we therefore recommend that in such stratified coves estimations of ksgd based on short lived radium isotopes require accurate and independent estimates of the water residence time as well as a good knowledge of the shallow and deep circulation patterns of the cove water keywords coastal karstic aquifer mediterranean sea submarine groundwater discharge radium isotopes 1 introduction submarine groundwater discharge sgd has received increased attention during the last few decades since it was recognized that it may be both volumetrically and chemically important johannes 1980 moore 1996a ferguson and gleeson 2012 moosdorf and oehler 2017 investigations into fresh groundwater inputs into the sea were initially related to water resource purposes but there is now a growing consensus that sgd includes both fresh groundwater and re circulated seawater and that it may be an important pathway for material transport from land to the ocean playing a relevant role in coastal ecology and geochemical cycles of several compounds such as nutrients metals carbon or pollutants see several review articles burnett and dulaiova 2003 2006 charette et al 2008 knee and paytan 2011 moore 2010 santos et al 2012 slomp and van cappellen 2004 swarzenski 2007 many studies published on this subject were performed at the scale of long coastlines of tens or hundreds of kilometers where porous aquifers are discharging e g moore et al 2008 peterson et al 2009 waska and kim 2011 lamontagne et al 2015 or in large lagoons e g rapaglia et al 2010 baudron et al 2015 in these cases the submarine groundwater whatever its origin terrestrial or marine as defined by stieglitz et al 2013 circulates into the sediments mixes with the pore water and flows at the sediment water interface recently rodellas et al 2015 used 228ra activities in a mass balance approach to calculate that sgd inputs along the mediterranean shoreline they found that they may range from 6 to 100 106 m3 km yr which corresponds to 1 2 to 19 times the fluxes coming from the rivers ludwig et al 2009 including both fresh groundwater and re circulated seawater around the mediterranean sea 60 of the coastline is composed of karstic aquifers in addition first estimates based on hydrogeology indicated that they may contribute up to 75 of the total fresh water inputs to the mediterranean sea unesco 2004 custodio 2010 bakalowicz 2015 to properly estimate the hydrological budget of the mediterranean sea it is therefore necessary to better estimate the karstic submarine groundwater discharges ksgd sgd related research has mainly focused on the development of new techniques to detect and quantify sgd in particular radium isotopes 223ra 224ra 226ra 228ra radon 222rn or other tracers moore 1996a b 2003 the radium tracers are usually enriched in coastal groundwater relative to coastal seawater and behave conservatively once released to the coastal ocean since their half lives range from 3 7 days to 1600 years they can be incorporated to mass balances in order to estimate sgd flows on a variety of time scales and they can be used to distinguish different groundwater sources and also to estimate the residence time of coastal waters charette et al 2008 the mass balance approach requires defining the boundaries of the system investigated represented as a box of coastal waters receiving the sgd and characterizing all the terms and sinks contributing to the radionuclide concentrations within this box it includes the volume of the coastal water study site the water residence time as well as a representative concentration of the tracer for both surface water and discharging groundwater it relies on the hypothesis that their concentrations are uniform in the water column and samples collected just below the surface are taken as representative of the whole system whatever the water depth thus the water column is assumed to present a homogeneous and integrated signal of the natural tracers entering the system via groundwater pathways in the case of karstic aquifers carbonate rocks contain karst conduits that play the role of preferential pathways connecting the fissured rock matrix flow and the karst network e g ford and williams 2007 flows are thus highly heterogeneous and groundwater discharges usually occur at very specific points corresponding to springs leading to high discharge rates in a few outlets draining the whole recharge area furthermore these springs may be located below or just at the surface of the sea level fleury et al 2007 and the associated brackish or freshwater plume may induce a stratification in the water column garcia solsona et al 2010a b montiel et al 2018 showed that methods to assess sgd should be adapted in the case of karstic submarine springs and they highlighted that there are still many field difficulties that can corrupt the correct estimation of the sgd the aim of this paper was to test the reliability and accuracy of the 223ra 224ra tracer technique to estimate sgd in a coastal karstic environment where the sgd concentrates in point sources of discharge i e at submarine springs and then mixes and spreads in the sea water column yielding 3d salinity temperature or tracer concentration contrasts therefore the estimate requires adapting the field data survey and the calculation model this study focuses on the port miou brackish submarine spring se france discharging into a natural cove called calanque this case study offers two main advantages i the shape of the calanque limits the exchanges inflow and outflow with the open sea at the mouth of the natural cove ii the discharge and salinity of the submarine spring are monitored by continuous in situ sensors at a gauging station in the flooded karst conduit located 500 m upstream of the sea underground laboratory moreover this spring is one of the major sources of sgd to the mediterranean sea in europe tulipano et al 2005 custodio 2010 arfib and charlier 2016 in addition there is no sediment or runoff which means that a simplified radium mass balance can be performed 2 site description the calanque and the karstic coastal aquifer of port miou the calanque of port miou is located in the bay of cassis 15 km from marseille city se france it is a kind of cove a small dry valley cut into the tight early cretaceous limestone urgonian facies from the land to the sea fig 1 the term calanque will be used in the remainder of this paper to refer to the submerged part of the valley where the sea enters between steep rocky cliffs the calanque is oriented ne sw it is 1 3 km long but is very narrow 20 m wide on average and its shape is very similar to other calanques between marseille and cassis the water depth increases slowly from 0 at the ne down to 25 m at the outlet of the calanque where it is directly connected to the sea the flux of water exchanged between the calanque and the coastal sea is unknown but it may be driven by the groundwater discharge and the wind port miou is one of the largest karst springs in europe with an average annual brackish discharge ranging between 3 and 8 m3 s 1 tulipano et al 2005 custodio 2010 bakalowicz 2015 arfib and charlier 2016 chen et al 2017 the catchment area extends mainly over a natural landscape made of hills karst plateau and polje the northern boundary of the recharge area is not well known but considering the geological context the area was evaluated at 400 km2 several springs discharge into the calanque of port miou the main spring discharge occurs around 10 m water deep on the southern western flank of the calanque and corresponds to a large karst conduit open to the sea it has been explored from the outlet by cave divers who discovered a huge saturated sub horizontal 20 m diameter karst conduit developing more than 2 km inland arfib and charlier 2016 other small springs occur at sea level on the northern side of the calanque fig 1 and appendix a2 in the 70 s a submarine dam was built in the main karst conduit 500 m inland with a man made access via an underground tunnel and shaft groundwater flows through pipes across the dam that blocks the karst the dam was built with the aim of decreasing the groundwater salinity it stopped the direct intrusion of shallow water upflowing from the sea by the mouth of the spring but the groundwater remained brackish showing that the seawater intrusion encroaches the aquifer in depth upstream the spring and the dam regular in situ measurements at the dam and at the northern springs in the calanque showed that groundwater salinity and temperature are similar these outlets discharge the same aquifer throughout the year and give access to the groundwater since the 2000s this dam has been equipped with pressure sensors to monitor the groundwater discharge and the salinity fig 2 the recent study by arfib and charlier 2016 based on 4 years of data from 2011 to 2014 rainfall discharge and salinity time series proposed a conceptual model of saline intrusion suggesting that the salinity results from seawater intrusion by the mixing of a deep brackish groundwater reservoir with shallow fresh groundwater 3 data 3 1 sampling as pointed out by montiel et al 2018 the selection of a representative groundwater end member is a critical component of any tracer study groundwater samples were collected upstream the underground dam in the karst conduit hereafter called dam groundwater samples and at the northern outlets hereafter called spring groundwater samples systematically the day before collecting the calanque and coastal waters two field campaigns were performed in july 2012 and september 2014 additional samples were also collected in january and march 2013 in order to explore the variability of radium composition with time table 1 fig 1 these sampling locations give access to the brackish groundwater discharging to the sea without shallow seawater intrusion pollution at the dam and with a very low pollution at the northern springs continuous in situ salinity measurements at the port miou underground dam which are essential for thesalt mass balance are scarcebut would enable the uncertainty of the sgd estimate to be reduced cerdà domènech et al 2017 calanque and coastal water samples were also collected during the two field campaigns in july 2012 most of the samples were taken from the coastal water in front of the exit of the calanque while in september 2014 they were taken mainly in the calanque itself fig 1 temperature and salinity were measured with an hq40d multiparameter probe hach in addition vertical profiles of salinity and temperature of the water column were obtained during the september 2014 campaign at each sampling location in 2014 with a ctd diver datalogger fig 3 salinity psu was calculated from specific conductivity measurements using the sheet available from amont and kerouel 2004 3 2 radium measurements samples were collected in surface water about 0 5 m deep by pumping water into a plastic container for the analysis of radium some vertical profiles of 223ra and 224ra were also sampled in july 2012 january 2013 and august 2014 using a niskin bottle fig 1 the volume of water samples ranged from 15 groundwater to 60 l coastal waters radium isotopes were extracted by passing water samples by gravity through a pvc cartridge filled with 20 g dry weight of manganese oxide impregnated acrylic fiber mn fiber the water flow rate was kept at less than 1 l per minute in order to ensure that the retention capacity of the mn fiber was higher than 97 moore 2008 before processing the sample the water content of each mn fiber was kept between 0 4 and 1 1 gh2o gfiber in order to obtain maximum emanation efficiency sun and torgersen 1998 the samples were processed with the radecc system for 223ra and 224ra radium delayed coincidence counting 223ra and 224ra activity measurements with radecc were calibrated using 4 in house mono isotope standards of 227ac and 232th the parent isotopes of 223ra and 224ra respectively and 4 multi isotope standards containing 227ac 232th and 226ra all standards were prepared according to the technique of scholten et al 2010 the detection efficiencies of our four detectors were very similar and close to the values reported in scholten et al 2010 changes with time occurred within the error range all errors were calculated according to garcia solsona et al 2008b the activity of 228th in water was processed with radecc one month after collection measuring supported 224ra activity in equilibrium with 228th 227ac activity in water was processed with radecc 3 months after collection measuring supported 223ra in equilibrium with 227ac further details of the analytical technique are reported in baudron et al 2015 and cockenpot 2016 3 3 karst spring discharge and salinity direct measurement of the groundwater discharge is available inland in the karst conduit 500 m upstream the main port miou submarine spring the discharge is estimated by the head losses generated by the flow through the gates of the underground and submarine dam built across the karst conduit in the 1970s head measurements upstream hupstream and downstream hdownstream the dam with pressure sensors were converted into discharge by the general bernoulli hydraulic equation for submerged flow 1 q k δ h with q the karst groundwater discharge k a coefficient that accounts for losses area and units conversion and δ h h upstream h downstream δ h was calibrated with direct measurements of h using a level surveyor a few days before the sampling k had been calibrated by direct discharge measurement using the dilution method of fluorescent dye schnegg et al 2011 injected upstream in the karst conduit by cave divers head measurements used cera diver sensors with 0 5 cm h2o typical accuracy propagating the error using the variance formula yielded between 10 and 25 of uncertainties at discharge states of 3 4 m3 s the daily average value was calculated using the 20 s sampling interval measurements a previous study by arfib and charlier 2016 based on 962 days of salinity and discharge data daily average non continuous data from dec 16th 2010 to dec 11th 2014 showed that discharge can be roughly estimated by salinity measurements or by applying a lumped rainfall salinity discharge model in situ salinity was monitored with a ctd diver sensor at a 15 minute time step 3 4 current measurements three transects of vertical profile of flow velocity were collected in the calanque in september 2014 the objective was to evaluate the flow structure between the calanque and the open sea the data set was acquired using a downward looking adcp workhorse sentinel 600 khz teledyne rdi mounted on a powered boat the bin size was set to 50 cm due to the blanking distance and the transducer depth the first cell of measurements was approximately around 1 m below the surface layer the size of the near bed blank zone depends on water column depth but for water depths of 20 m the blank may be estimated around 1 2 m due to this problem of blank inherent to the adcp system it was not possible to obtain the current velocities or directions within the brackish surface layer and above the bottom consequently the flow rate exchange between the calanque and the sea was not estimated with adcp measurements the locations of the 3 transects are pinpointed on fig 1 transect 1 is located at the entrance of the calanque transect 2 is located in the middle of the calanque transect 3 was set to pass just above the submarine spring not visible from the surface the data were continuously geo referenced by a vessel mounted trimble dgps the raw data were averaged at each depth over 10 ensembles the data cell length is about 7 10 m in the horizontal direction 4 method 4 1 the radium mass balance approach to estimate sgd the mass balance approach also called radium box model was developed by moore 1996a and has been applied in numerous studies worldwide charette et al 2001 kim et al 2003 beck et al 2007 garcia solsona et al 2008a moore et al 2008 ollivier et al 2008 baudron et al 2015 rodellas et al 2015 by constraining all the potential ra sources and sinks within a box studied defined as the volume of coastal water affected by sgd the ra flux supplied by sgd can be estimated by the difference between inputs and outputs assuming steady state eq 1 in our case this steady state mass balance can be significantly simplified because there is no surface water flow into the calanque and only a very thin layer of sediment over the bedrock thus no diffusion from porewater 2 ra sgd ra in ra prod ra out

excess activities are un supported activities relative to the parent isotope 4 2 water salt and radium mass balance a second mass balance approach can be achieved by combining water salt and the

time series of the port miou karst spring recorded at the dam are plotted in fig 2 from 2010 to 2014 discharge ranged from 3 m3 s at the end of the low flow period to 37 m3 s during flood the spring is characterized by a typical karst type functioning with high flood events related to rainfall and a high base flow discharge as usually observed in coastal karstic springs fleury et al 2007 the water is brackish due to deep saline intrusion arfib and charlier 2016 salinity is correlated with discharge with drop during flood events except during floods salinity variations are very smooth with a seasonal trend the lowest salinities reached 2 g l whereas highest salinities increased up to 13 g l at the 15 minute recording time step salinity did not vary over the day with no influence of the sea tide the two radium campaigns were done during the low flow period in summer july 2012 september 2014 there had been no floods over the preceding month and no significant rainfall events the salinity of the submarine groundwater discharge to the calanque remained constant during the field campaigns discharge measurements were not available during the 2012 campaign fig 2 but a rough estimate of around 4 m3 s can be given using the lumped model of arfib and charlier 2016 in september 2014 karst discharge measurement at the underground dam was also close to 4 1 m3 s using the previously defined 25 error considering the salinity and discharge data as representative of the hydrological functioning of the aquifer the 2012 and 2014 field campaigns were in a similar condition 5 2 salinity and temperature samples five samples of groundwater were collected during and in between the two campaigns three upstream of the dam and two at the northern springs the temperature upstream the dam and in the spring samples were not significantly different 16 8 0 6 c the salinity was on average very stable upstream the dam 9 9 0 2 but slightly higher and more variable at the northern spring 11 1 this range falls in the higher band of the multi year variability measured between 2011 and 2014 fig 2 in the calanque the salinity of the surface samples collected in 2012 and 2014 ranged between 23 7 and 36 7 table 2 the salinity of the coastal water outside the calanque was between 34 5 and 38 5 vertical profiles of temperature and salinity were done at each location where surface water was collected for radium isotopes fig 3 measurements were performed every meter from the surface down to 10 m deep all profiles showed the same pattern characterized by a stratified surface layer between 1 and 2 m deep where the salinity increases slowly up to one similar to the seawater until the bottom 38 fig 3 plots of temperature against salinity showed the existence of these two water masses the water mass i which is less saline and warmer and the water mass ii similar to the sea water fig 3 5 3 radium isotope data radium isotopes are reported with salinity and temperature data in table 2 in groundwater samples 224ra and 223ra activities are not significantly different in samples collected upstream the dam and at the different outlets attesting a similar groundwater origin the activity values were on average 23 1 and 2 2 0 4 bq m3 for 224ra and 223ra table 1 the activities of 224ra and 223ra in the surface samples from the calanque ranged respectively from 4 3 0 2 to 13 1 and from 0 40 0 04 to 1 6 0 1 bq m3 measurements in the coastal water return lower values ranging between 2 50 0 08 and 0 20 0 01 for 224ra and between 0 008 0 003 and 0 20 0 02 bq m3 for 223ra 228th activities were on average 0 5 bq m3 in the calanque table 2 223ra and 224ra are linearly correlated and are also correlated with the salinity plotting on a two end member mixing line between the groundwater and the coastal water end members fig 4 a similar relation was also found by bejannin et al 2017 in the same area salinity and 224ra vertical profiles were measured at two stations pm7 during the campaign of july 2012 and pm cap in january 2013 and end of august 2014 a few days before the campaign 224ra and salinity were still correlated showing the stratified water column composed of the surface layer with lower salinity and a higher 224ra activity and a lower layer which has the same salinity and 224ra as coastal water fig 5 5 4 current measurements the transects of current are reported on fig 6 and their locations are given on fig 1 at large scale the surface layer is clearly a wind dominated layer that is pushed seaward the current velocity ranged around 10 cm s from mid depth to the bottom we clearly see a typical counterclockwise circulation with water flowing seaward on the western part of the calanque and flowing inside the calanque on the eastern part the 3 transects provide evidence of current acceleration from the end of the calanque inland to the mouth of the calanque that opens seaward and from the surface to the bottom at the entrance of the calanque transect 1 the depth averaged current velocity reaches 20 cm s seaward and 35 cm s landward within the calanque transect 2 the water flows are characterized by a weaker current 0 20 cm s the 3rd transect obtained above the main spring is characterized by a non homogeneous weak current note that the 10 m layer figure is not displayed here due to the shallow bathymetry however the data show that the surface layer is pushed eastward and the depth averaged current still reveals both structures 6 discussion the method generally used to estimate the flux of sgd with a ra mass balance requires evaluating 1 other potential non sgd sources and sinks 2 the volume of the study site affected by sgd the box 3 the residence time of coastal waters and 4 the representative concentration of ra in the discharging groundwater charette et al 2008 gonneea et al 2013 in the following we will first characterize the area in terms of volume salinity and radium average activities then we will discuss a method to estimate the ra flux offshore as well as the water fluxes exchanged with the sea finally we will compare our estimations of sgd to the values measured upstream of the dam in the karst conduit connected to the springs to discuss the accuracy and the sensitivity of the mass balance approach in this study the sgd was calculated using the radium isotope mass balance for the two measurement campaigns in july 2012 and september 2014 table 3 6 1 characterizing the conceptual box and end members in stratified waters 6 1 1 the volume of the box affected by sgd the gulf of lion is a microtidal environment with a tidal range of 0 30 m at mean spring tides aleman et al 2015 this range associated to the morphology of the calanque does not favor vertical mixing and explains why the water column is stratified fig 3 in front of the main spring at 10 m depth the salinity of the water is close to the seawater value fig 3 suggesting that the water coming from the main spring does not mix at the bottom this stratification makes it possible to better characterize the shape and volume of the box that needs to be used for the mass balance the shape is constrained by both sides of the calanque and is closed at the location of pm12 fig 1 where the salinity and radium activities are similar to those of the coastal seawater this represents a surface area of 125 000 m2 the deep layer is saltier colder and contains a very low amount of radium fig 3 it displays the characteristics of the coastal seawater the surface layer is less salty warmer and significantly enriched in radium isotopes as a consequence of the discharge from the submarine karstic springs based on profiles measured in 2014 the bottom of this surface layer is located between 1 25 and 2 m deep depending on the location with an average value of 1 5 m deep we therefore consider for the mass balance a box displaying a volume of 1 5 125 000 i e 187 500 m3 6 1 2 sgd and seawater end members the almost equal salinity and radium activities table 1 fig 4 measured in the five groundwater samples collected in the karst conduit upstream of the dam or in the spring show that the discharging groundwater is similar in the two sampling points this suggests that the composition of the karstic water is homogenous and therefore indicates that in this case the sgd end member is well identified and its composition well known therefore the existence of the dam means that the sgd end member can be sampled directly and this adds to the benefit of the radium mass balance model while in many other studies this term is hard to estimate to calculate the mass balance for july 2012 and september 2014 we used the radium and salinity data measured a few days before each campaign table 3 below 1 5 m deep in the calanque the water is not influenced by the groundwater at least in our vertical profile salinity and radium isotopes reach a constant value consistent with those from the coastal water the salinity and 223ra and 224ra values taken as representative for the seawater in 2012 and 2014 38 g l 0 02 and 0 4 bq m3 respectively are the values measured at depth below the mixing layer i table 3 figs 3 and 5 6 1 3 average water within the box estimating a representative value of the water within the conceptual box is more complicated due to the spatial variations in the calanque surface layer table 4 fig 1 the arithmetic means for the salinity 224ra 223ra 228th and 227ac data of the calanque were compared to the means weighted by the percentage of the total surface surrounding each station calculated using voronoi polygons within uncertainties 1σ standard deviation no significant differences were found between arithmetic and weighted means for either radium or salinity table 3 in the following the arithmetic means will be considered for all calculations table 3 6 2 estimating the karstic submarine groundwater discharge precision and accuracy of the method the flux of radium from the karstic submarine groundwater discharge rasgd can be estimated using equation 7 the flux of radium exported offshore raoff was calculated according to eqs 6 and 9 the apparent age of the calanque surface water tw eq 9 was 2 1 and 1 0 5 days for the sampling period of 2012 and 2014 meaning on average 1 1 day these results are similar to the water age estimated using 224ra and 228ra isotopes measured in port miou in 2009 0 7 1 6 days bejannin et al 2017 this result is also consistent with our approximation of using the ara values measured 1 day before the date of sampling in the calanque of port miou for the mass balance using these values of tw and the radium data ara reported in table 3 the calculation of raoff the flux of 223ra and 224ra between the calanque and the coastal area provide similar results for 2012 and 2014 within errors table 4 the terms of radium production raprod and decay radec in the box studied were calculated table 4 using the volume and the activities of 224ra 223ra 228th and 227ac for the calanque discussed in section 6 1 3 the different inputs and outputs of the radium mass balance in table 4 shows that a flux of radium needs to be added to compensate the loss by decay and export this radium flux rasgd may be ascribed to groundwater discharge the groundwater discharge of the karstic spring of port miou qsgd can therefore be calculated by dividing the flux of radium rasgd by the activity of the spring eq 8 table 4 the values obtained are very low arithmetic mean of 0 6 0 1 m3 s but significant within the errors propagated for all terms of the mass balance the fact that the mass balances calculated for 223ra and 224ra isotopes and for two different periods 2012 and 2014 are very similar is an argument that our approach is robust these values compare fairly well with the estimation made by bejannin et al 2017 on the same area but with 228ra they obtained a terrestrial groundwater flux of 0 6 1 2 m3 s using data collected in july 2009 however these values are significantly lower than the water discharge measured at the dam 0 6 0 1 versus 4 1 m3 s this is surprising because the radium mass balance integrates in the calanque all the inputs from the karstic aquifer including the small springs from the ne side as well as possible unknown springs if they have the same radium activities fig 1 therefore one should expect the qsgd value estimated with radium isotopes to be higher by at least a factor of 5 since the discharge measurement of qsgd at the dam is reliable to within 25 it appears that our estimation of the qsgd using the 223ra 224ra mass balance is precise but not accurate the radium mass balance approach has been commonly used in a large number of hydrological settings charette et al 2001 kim et al 2005 beck et al 2007 garcia solsona et al 2008b moore et al 2008 ollivier et al 2008 gattacceca et al 2011 garcia orellana et al 2014 baudron et al 2015 montiel et al 2018 it can be simplified by combining eqs 5 7 where the determination of qin and qout is not required another method based on the resolution of the water salt mass balance and the value of the spring discharge measured upstream the dam can be used to calculate the fluxes of water exchanged between the calanque and the coastal sea qin and qout see section 4 2 eqs 11 15 this approach is based on the difference in salinity and 224ra between the coastal water the calanque and the spring qin qout and qsgd were simulated using the values reported in table 3 for 2012 and 2014 in the range of their respective uncertainties all the solutions were calculated and the results show that the distribution of the solutions is a gaussian the mean qsgd is 0 2 m3 s for both the 2012 and 2014 campaigns fig 7 these results are consistent with the previous calculation based on ra mass balance only our results return very similar values when using different data sets 2012 2014 and both 223ra and 224ra this suggests that at least one parameter in eq 2 plays a key role in the estimation of qsgd independently of the radium and salinity measurements in the karstic spring the calanque of port miou and seawater we can question the estimation of the volume of the calanque v the depth of the layer at which the karstic groundwater mixes has been shown to vary between 1 and 2 m all the calculations were performed with a value of 1 5 m by propagating an error of 0 5 m on the calculation of qsgd we obtain a shift in qsgd value which at most reaches 0 8 m3 s another key parameter in solving eq 7 is the water residence time tw our results show that tw is short relative to the decay period of 224ra the very good correlation between 224ra and salinity fig 5 is another indication that mixing between the karstic springs and the water in the calanque is almost instantaneous our estimations of tw are not very precise tw 1 1 days propagating the error on tw has a strong impact on the calculated qsgd fig 8 shows that the calculated qsgd value follows an exponential decrease with increasing tw tw is taken to vary over the range 1 1 day the reference value of qsgd measured at the dam 4 1 m3 s is obtained for a residence time of c a 0 2 days which is about 5 h while for tw 1 day the qsgd simulated value is 1 m3 s in such cases where the water residence time is short the estimation of qsgd based on radium mass balance cannot be accurate finally the inaccuracy of the estimation may be associated to a particular hydrodynamic setting in this area we suggest that the water exchange between the calanque and the open sea is made through an output in the surface layer and an equivalent input in the deeper layer however the adcp profiles show that there is already an exchange within the deep layer with strong currents entering the calanque on the east and exiting on the west fig 6 it is thus possible that part of the entire discharge of the groundwater coming from the deep spring is entrained within this deep circulation and exits the calanque without feeding the surface layer in this case the sgd occurring in the surface water will be mainly or only due to the surface springs and this may explain the lower value obtained 7 conclusions in this work we have reported 223ra 224ra salinity profiles and current measurements in order to understand the degree of precision and accuracy with which we can estimate the submarine groundwater discharge of a main karstic spring discharging at 10 m depth in a cove the port miou calanque the cove water is consequently stratified as two different water masses can be distinguished the shallower water mass 1 5 m deep on average brackish and cool and the deeper water mass which displays the temperature and salinity characteristics of sea water water salinity and radium mass balances were performed in the shallower mixing box to estimate the submarine groundwater discharge qsgd the mean value obtained with 223ra and 224ra is precise but significantly lower 0 6 0 1 m3 s than direct measurements of the groundwater discharge available inland in the karst conduit 500 m upstream the main port miou submarine spring 4 1 m3 s the residence time of the cove water estimated using both 224ra and 223ra isotopes is very low 1 1 day first a high uncertainty for a low water residence time propagates exponentially onto the calculated qsgd second we suggest that the shape and geometry of the cove as well as the location of the discharge point of the spring play a key role in explaining these discrepant results the water circulation in the cove at the location of the karstic spring discharge favors the export of the groundwater in the deeper water mass and decreases the contribution of the karstic spring into the shallower mixing box that was considered for the mass balance calculations we therefore conclude that in such a stratified mediterranean cove the estimations of sgd based on short lived radium isotopes have to be used with caution if the circulation pattern of the cove water is not well understood declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

a powerful technique this approach requires characterizing all the contributing terms and sinks in the coastal water volume affected by sgd the residence time of coastal waters as well as a representative concentration of the tracers for both surface water and discharging groundwater in this study we combine several approaches 223ra 224ra salinity profiles and acoustic doppler current profiler adcp measurements to examine both the accuracy and sensitivity of the radium mass balance method in the case of the cove of port miou mediterranean sea france where the main karstic spring discharges locally at 10 m depth this study benefits from the inland in situ access to the main karst conduit discharging to the sea which provides a long time series to characterize the brackish submarine groundwater end member we show that the composition of the cove water is stratified with two water bodies a surface brackish layer and a deeper layer the mean ksgd value obtained with 223ra and 224ra mass balances in the surface water body is precise but significantly lower 0 6 0 1 m3 s than the karstic spring discharge 4 1 m3 s estimated within the karst conduit with pressure sensors the residence time of the cove water estimated using both 224ra and 223ra isotopes is very low 1 1 day our study shows that the water residence time that we calculated using the ra mass balance is the key parameter that may impact ksgd in addition based on adcp transects we suggest that the shape and geometry of the cove as well as the location of the discharge point of the spring play a key role in explaining these discrepant results we therefore recommend that in such stratified coves estimations of ksgd based on short lived radium isotopes require accurate and independent estimates of the water residence time as well as a good knowledge of the shallow and deep circulation patterns of the cove water keywords coastal karstic aquifer mediterranean sea submarine groundwater discharge radium isotopes 1 introduction submarine groundwater discharge sgd has received increased attention during the last few decades since it was recognized that it may be both volumetrically and chemically important johannes 1980 moore 1996a ferguson and gleeson 2012 moosdorf and oehler 2017 investigations into fresh groundwater inputs into the sea were initially related to water resource purposes but there is now a growing consensus that sgd includes both fresh groundwater and re circulated seawater and that it may be an important pathway for material transport from land to the ocean playing a relevant role in coastal ecology and geochemical cycles of several compounds such as nutrients metals carbon or pollutants see several review articles burnett and dulaiova 2003 2006 charette et al 2008 knee and paytan 2011 moore 2010 santos et al 2012 slomp and van cappellen 2004 swarzenski 2007 many studies published on this subject were performed at the scale of long coastlines of tens or hundreds of kilometers where porous aquifers are discharging e g moore et al 2008 peterson et al 2009 waska and kim 2011 lamontagne et al 2015 or in large lagoons e g rapaglia et al 2010 baudron et al 2015 in these cases the submarine groundwater whatever its origin terrestrial or marine as defined by stieglitz et al 2013 circulates into the sediments mixes with the pore water and flows at the sediment water interface recently rodellas et al 2015 used 228ra activities in a mass balance approach to calculate that sgd inputs along the mediterranean shoreline they found that they may range from 6 to 100 106 m3 km yr which corresponds to 1 2 to 19 times the fluxes coming from the rivers ludwig et al 2009 including both fresh groundwater and re circulated seawater around the mediterranean sea 60 of the coastline is composed of karstic aquifers in addition first estimates based on hydrogeology indicated that they may contribute up to 75 of the total fresh water inputs to the mediterranean sea unesco 2004 custodio 2010 bakalowicz 2015 to properly estimate the hydrological budget of the mediterranean sea it is therefore necessary to better estimate the karstic submarine groundwater discharges ksgd sgd related research has mainly focused on the development of new techniques to detect and quantify sgd in particular radium isotopes 223ra 224ra 226ra 228ra radon 222rn or other tracers moore 1996a b 2003 the radium tracers are usually enriched in coastal groundwater relative to coastal seawater and behave conservatively once released to the coastal ocean since their half lives range from 3 7 days to 1600 years they can be incorporated to mass balances in order to estimate sgd flows on a variety of time scales and they can be used to distinguish different groundwater sources and also to estimate the residence time of coastal waters charette et al 2008 the mass balance approach requires defining the boundaries of the system investigated represented as a box of coastal waters receiving the sgd and characterizing all the terms and sinks contributing to the radionuclide concentrations within this box it includes the volume of the coastal water study site the water residence time as well as a representative concentration of the tracer for both surface water and discharging groundwater it relies on the hypothesis that their concentrations are uniform in the water column and samples collected just below the surface are taken as representative of the whole system whatever the water depth thus the water column is assumed to present a homogeneous and integrated signal of the natural tracers entering the system via groundwater pathways in the case of karstic aquifers carbonate rocks contain karst conduits that play the role of preferential pathways connecting the fissured rock matrix flow and the karst network e g ford and williams 2007 flows are thus highly heterogeneous and groundwater discharges usually occur at very specific points corresponding to springs leading to high discharge rates in a few outlets draining the whole recharge area furthermore these springs may be located below or just at the surface of the sea level fleury et al 2007 and the associated brackish or freshwater plume may induce a stratification in the water column garcia solsona et al 2010a b montiel et al 2018 showed that methods to assess sgd should be adapted in the case of karstic submarine springs and they highlighted that there are still many field difficulties that can corrupt the correct estimation of the sgd the aim of this paper was to test the reliability and accuracy of the 223ra 224ra tracer technique to estimate sgd in a coastal karstic environment where the sgd concentrates in point sources of discharge i e at submarine springs and then mixes and spreads in the sea water column yielding 3d salinity temperature or tracer concentration contrasts therefore the estimate requires adapting the field data survey and the calculation model this study focuses on the port miou brackish submarine spring se france discharging into a natural cove called calanque this case study offers two main advantages i the shape of the calanque limits the exchanges inflow and outflow with the open sea at the mouth of the natural cove ii the discharge and salinity of the submarine spring are monitored by continuous in situ sensors at a gauging station in the flooded karst conduit located 500 m upstream of the sea underground laboratory moreover this spring is one of the major sources of sgd to the mediterranean sea in europe tulipano et al 2005 custodio 2010 arfib and charlier 2016 in addition there is no sediment or runoff which means that a simplified radium mass balance can be performed 2 site description the calanque and the karstic coastal aquifer of port miou the calanque of port miou is located in the bay of cassis 15 km from marseille city se france it is a kind of cove a small dry valley cut into the tight early cretaceous limestone urgonian facies from the land to the sea fig 1 the term calanque will be used in the remainder of this paper to refer to the submerged part of the valley where the sea enters between steep rocky cliffs the calanque is oriented ne sw it is 1 3 km long but is very narrow 20 m wide on average and its shape is very similar to other calanques between marseille and cassis the water depth increases slowly from 0 at the ne down to 25 m at the outlet of the calanque where it is directly connected to the sea the flux of water exchanged between the calanque and the coastal sea is unknown but it may be driven by the groundwater discharge and the wind port miou is one of the largest karst springs in europe with an average annual brackish discharge ranging between 3 and 8 m3 s 1 tulipano et al 2005 custodio 2010 bakalowicz 2015 arfib and charlier 2016 chen et al 2017 the catchment area extends mainly over a natural landscape made of hills karst plateau and polje the northern boundary of the recharge area is not well known but considering the geological context the area was evaluated at 400 km2 several springs discharge into the calanque of port miou the main spring discharge occurs around 10 m water deep on the southern western flank of the calanque and corresponds to a large karst conduit open to the sea it has been explored from the outlet by cave divers who discovered a huge saturated sub horizontal 20 m diameter karst conduit developing more than 2 km inland arfib and charlier 2016 other small springs occur at sea level on the northern side of the calanque fig 1 and appendix a2 in the 70 s a submarine dam was built in the main karst conduit 500 m inland with a man made access via an underground tunnel and shaft groundwater flows through pipes across the dam that blocks the karst the dam was built with the aim of decreasing the groundwater salinity it stopped the direct intrusion of shallow water upflowing from the sea by the mouth of the spring but the groundwater remained brackish showing that the seawater intrusion encroaches the aquifer in depth upstream the spring and the dam regular in situ measurements at the dam and at the northern springs in the calanque showed that groundwater salinity and temperature are similar these outlets discharge the same aquifer throughout the year and give access to the groundwater since the 2000s this dam has been equipped with pressure sensors to monitor the groundwater discharge and the salinity fig 2 the recent study by arfib and charlier 2016 based on 4 years of data from 2011 to 2014 rainfall discharge and salinity time series proposed a conceptual model of saline intrusion suggesting that the salinity results from seawater intrusion by the mixing of a deep brackish groundwater reservoir with shallow fresh groundwater 3 data 3 1 sampling as pointed out by montiel et al 2018 the selection of a representative groundwater end member is a critical component of any tracer study groundwater samples were collected upstream the underground dam in the karst conduit hereafter called dam groundwater samples and at the northern outlets hereafter called spring groundwater samples systematically the day before collecting the calanque and coastal waters two field campaigns were performed in july 2012 and september 2014 additional samples were also collected in january and march 2013 in order to explore the variability of radium composition with time table 1 fig 1 these sampling locations give access to the brackish groundwater discharging to the sea without shallow seawater intrusion pollution at the dam and with a very low pollution at the northern springs continuous in situ salinity measurements at the port miou underground dam which are essential for thesalt mass balance are scarcebut would enable the uncertainty of the sgd estimate to be reduced cerdà domènech et al 2017 calanque and coastal water samples were also collected during the two field campaigns in july 2012 most of the samples were taken from the coastal water in front of the exit of the calanque while in september 2014 they were taken mainly in the calanque itself fig 1 temperature and salinity were measured with an hq40d multiparameter probe hach in addition vertical profiles of salinity and temperature of the water column were obtained during the september 2014 campaign at each sampling location in 2014 with a ctd diver datalogger fig 3 salinity psu was calculated from specific conductivity measurements using the sheet available from amont and kerouel 2004 3 2 radium measurements samples were collected in surface water about 0 5 m deep by pumping water into a plastic container for the analysis of radium some vertical profiles of 223ra and 224ra were also sampled in july 2012 january 2013 and august 2014 using a niskin bottle fig 1 the volume of water samples ranged from 15 groundwater to 60 l coastal waters radium isotopes were extracted by passing water samples by gravity through a pvc cartridge filled with 20 g dry weight of manganese oxide impregnated acrylic fiber mn fiber the water flow rate was kept at less than 1 l per minute in order to ensure that the retention capacity of the mn fiber was higher than 97 moore 2008 before processing the sample the water content of each mn fiber was kept between 0 4 and 1 1 gh2o gfiber in order to obtain maximum emanation efficiency sun and torgersen 1998 the samples were processed with the radecc system for 223ra and 224ra radium delayed coincidence counting 223ra and 224ra activity measurements with radecc were calibrated using 4 in house mono isotope standards of 227ac and 232th the parent isotopes of 223ra and 224ra respectively and 4 multi isotope standards containing 227ac 232th and 226ra all standards were prepared according to the technique of scholten et al 2010 the detection efficiencies of our four detectors were very similar and close to the values reported in scholten et al 2010 changes with time occurred within the error range all errors were calculated according to garcia solsona et al 2008b the activity of 228th in water was processed with radecc one month after collection measuring supported 224ra activity in equilibrium with 228th 227ac activity in water was processed with radecc 3 months after collection measuring supported 223ra in equilibrium with 227ac further details of the analytical technique are reported in baudron et al 2015 and cockenpot 2016 3 3 karst spring discharge and salinity direct measurement of the groundwater discharge is available inland in the karst conduit 500 m upstream the main port miou submarine spring the discharge is estimated by the head losses generated by the flow through the gates of the underground and submarine dam built across the karst conduit in the 1970s head measurements upstream hupstream and downstream hdownstream the dam with pressure sensors were converted into discharge by the general bernoulli hydraulic equation for submerged flow 1 q k δ h with q the karst groundwater discharge k a coefficient that accounts for losses area and units conversion and δ h h upstream h downstream δ h was calibrated with direct measurements of h using a level surveyor a few days before the sampling k had been calibrated by direct discharge measurement using the dilution method of fluorescent dye schnegg et al 2011 injected upstream in the karst conduit by cave divers head measurements used cera diver sensors with 0 5 cm h2o typical accuracy propagating the error using the variance formula yielded between 10 and 25 of uncertainties at discharge states of 3 4 m3 s the daily average value was calculated using the 20 s sampling interval measurements a previous study by arfib and charlier 2016 based on 962 days of salinity and discharge data daily average non continuous data from dec 16th 2010 to dec 11th 2014 showed that discharge can be roughly estimated by salinity measurements or by applying a lumped rainfall salinity discharge model in situ salinity was monitored with a ctd diver sensor at a 15 minute time step 3 4 current measurements three transects of vertical profile of flow velocity were collected in the calanque in september 2014 the objective was to evaluate the flow structure between the calanque and the open sea the data set was acquired using a downward looking adcp workhorse sentinel 600 khz teledyne rdi mounted on a powered boat the bin size was set to 50 cm due to the blanking distance and the transducer depth the first cell of measurements was approximately around 1 m below the surface layer the size of the near bed blank zone depends on water column depth but for water depths of 20 m the blank may be estimated around 1 2 m due to this problem of blank inherent to the adcp system it was not possible to obtain the current velocities or directions within the brackish surface layer and above the bottom consequently the flow rate exchange between the calanque and the sea was not estimated with adcp measurements the locations of the 3 transects are pinpointed on fig 1 transect 1 is located at the entrance of the calanque transect 2 is located in the middle of the calanque transect 3 was set to pass just above the submarine spring not visible from the surface the data were continuously geo referenced by a vessel mounted trimble dgps the raw data were averaged at each depth over 10 ensembles the data cell length is about 7 10 m in the horizontal direction 4 method 4 1 the radium mass balance approach to estimate sgd the mass balance approach also called radium box model was developed by moore 1996a and has been applied in numerous studies worldwide charette et al 2001 kim et al 2003 beck et al 2007 garcia solsona et al 2008a moore et al 2008 ollivier et al 2008 baudron et al 2015 rodellas et al 2015 by constraining all the potential ra sources and sinks within a box studied defined as the volume of coastal water affected by sgd the ra flux supplied by sgd can be estimated by the difference between inputs and outputs assuming steady state eq 1 in our case this steady state mass balance can be significantly simplified because there is no surface water flow into the calanque and only a very thin layer of sediment over the bedrock thus no diffusion from porewater 2 ra sgd ra in ra prod ra out

excess activities are un supported activities relative to the parent isotope 4 2 water salt and radium mass balance a second mass balance approach can be achieved by combining water salt and the radium mass balances in order to estimate the flux of coastal water entering the calanque qin the flux of calanque water flowing out of the calanque to the sea qout and the groundwater discharge to

time series of the port miou karst spring recorded at the dam are plotted in fig 2 from 2010 to 2014 discharge ranged from 3 m3 s at the end of the low flow period to 37 m3 s during flood the spring is characterized by a typical karst type functioning with high flood events related to rainfall and a high base flow discharge as usually observed in coastal karstic springs fleury et al 2007 the water is brackish due to deep saline intrusion arfib and charlier 2016 salinity is correlated with discharge with drop during flood events except during floods salinity variations are very smooth with a seasonal trend the lowest salinities reached 2 g l whereas highest salinities increased up to 13 g l at the 15 minute recording time step salinity did not vary over the day with no influence of the sea tide the two radium campaigns were done during the low flow period in summer july 2012 september 2014 there had been no floods over the preceding month and no significant rainfall events the salinity of the submarine groundwater discharge to the calanque remained constant during the field campaigns discharge measurements were not available during the 2012 campaign fig 2 but a rough estimate of around 4 m3 s can be given using the lumped model of arfib and charlier 2016 in september 2014 karst discharge measurement at the underground dam was also close to 4 1 m3 s using the previously defined 25 error considering the salinity and discharge data as representative of the hydrological functioning of the aquifer the 2012 and 2014 field campaigns were in a similar condition 5 2 salinity and temperature samples five samples of groundwater were collected during and in between the two campaigns three upstream of the dam and two at the northern springs the temperature upstream the dam and in the spring samples were not significantly different 16 8 0 6 c the salinity was on average very stable upstream the dam 9 9 0 2 but slightly higher and more variable at the northern spring 11 1 this range falls in the higher band of the multi year variability measured between 2011 and 2014 fig 2 in the calanque the salinity of the surface samples collected in 2012 and 2014 ranged between 23 7 and 36 7 table 2 the salinity of the coastal water outside the calanque was between 34 5 and 38 5 vertical profiles of temperature and salinity were done at each location where surface water was collected for radium isotopes fig 3 measurements were performed every meter from the surface down to 10 m deep all profiles showed the same pattern characterized by a stratified surface layer between 1 and 2 m deep where the salinity increases slowly up to one similar to the seawater until the bottom 38 fig 3 plots of temperature against salinity showed the existence of these two water masses the water mass i which is less saline and warmer and the water mass ii similar to the sea water fig 3 5 3 radium isotope data radium isotopes are reported with salinity and temperature data in table 2 in groundwater samples 224ra and 223ra activities are not significantly different in samples collected upstream the dam and at the different outlets attesting a similar groundwater origin the activity values were on average 23 1 and 2 2 0 4 bq m3 for 224ra and 223ra table 1 the activities of 224ra and 223ra in the surface samples from the calanque ranged respectively from 4 3 0 2 to 13 1 and from 0 40 0 04 to 1 6 0 1 bq m3 measurements in the coastal water return lower values ranging between 2 50 0 08 and 0 20 0 01 for 224ra and between 0 008 0 003 and 0 20 0 02 bq m3 for 223ra 228th activities were on average 0 5 bq m3 in the calanque table 2 223ra and 224ra are linearly correlated and are also correlated with the salinity plotting on a two end member mixing line between the groundwater and the coastal water end members fig 4 a similar relation was also found by bejannin et al 2017 in the same area salinity and 224ra vertical profiles were measured at two stations pm7 during the campaign of july 2012 and pm cap in january 2013 and end of august 2014 a few days before the campaign 224ra and salinity were still correlated showing the stratified water column composed of the surface layer with lower salinity and a higher 224ra activity and a lower layer which has the same salinity and 224ra as coastal water fig 5 5 4 current measurements the transects of current are reported on fig 6 and their locations are given on fig 1 at large scale the surface layer is clearly a wind dominated layer that is pushed seaward the current velocity ranged around 10 cm s from mid depth to the bottom we clearly see a typical counterclockwise circulation with water flowing seaward on the western part of the calanque and flowing inside the calanque on the eastern part the 3 transects provide evidence of current acceleration from the end of the calanque inland to the mouth of the calanque that opens seaward and from the surface to the bottom at the entrance of the calanque transect 1 the depth averaged current velocity reaches 20 cm s seaward and 35 cm s landward within the calanque transect 2 the water flows are characterized by a weaker current 0 20 cm s the 3rd transect obtained above the main spring is characterized by a non homogeneous weak current note that the 10 m layer figure is not displayed here due to the shallow bathymetry however the data show that the surface layer is pushed eastward and the depth averaged current still reveals both structures 6 discussion the method generally used to estimate the flux of sgd with a ra mass balance requires evaluating 1 other potential non sgd sources and sinks 2 the volume of the study site affected by sgd the box 3 the residence time of coastal waters and 4 the representative concentration of ra in the discharging groundwater charette et al 2008 gonneea et al 2013 in the following we will first characterize the area in terms of volume salinity and radium average activities then we will discuss a method to estimate the ra flux offshore as well as the water fluxes exchanged with the sea finally we will compare our estimations of sgd to the values measured upstream of the dam in the karst conduit connected to the springs to discuss the accuracy and the sensitivity of the mass balance approach in this study the sgd was calculated using the radium isotope mass balance for the two measurement campaigns in july 2012 and september 2014 table 3 6 1 characterizing the conceptual box and end members in stratified waters 6 1 1 the volume of the box affected by sgd the gulf of lion is a microtidal environment with a tidal range of 0 30 m at mean spring tides aleman et al 2015 this range associated to the morphology of the calanque does not favor vertical mixing and explains why the water column is stratified fig 3 in front of the main spring at 10 m depth the salinity of the water is close to the seawater value fig 3 suggesting that the water coming from the main spring does not mix at the bottom this stratification makes it possible to better characterize the shape and volume of the box that needs to be used for the mass balance the shape is constrained by both sides of the calanque and is closed at the location of pm12 fig 1 where the salinity and radium activities are similar to those of the coastal seawater this represents a surface area of 125 000 m2 the deep layer is saltier colder and contains a very low amount of radium fig 3 it displays the characteristics of the coastal seawater the surface layer is less salty warmer and significantly enriched in radium isotopes as a consequence of the discharge from the submarine karstic springs based on profiles measured in 2014 the bottom of this surface layer is located between 1 25 and 2 m deep depending on the location with an average value of 1 5 m deep we therefore consider for the mass balance a box displaying a volume of 1 5 125 000 i e 187 500 m3 6 1 2 sgd and seawater end members the almost equal salinity and radium activities table 1 fig 4 measured in the five groundwater samples collected in the karst conduit upstream of the dam or in the spring show that the discharging groundwater is similar in the two sampling points this suggests that the composition of the karstic water is homogenous and therefore indicates that in this case the sgd end member is well identified and its composition well known therefore the existence of the dam means that the sgd end member can be sampled directly and this adds to the benefit of the radium mass balance model while in many other studies this term is hard to estimate to calculate the mass balance for july 2012 and september 2014 we used the radium and salinity data measured a few days before each campaign table 3 below 1 5 m deep in the calanque the water is not influenced by the groundwater at least in our vertical profile salinity and radium isotopes reach a constant value consistent with those from the coastal water the salinity and 223ra and 224ra values taken as representative for the seawater in 2012 and 2014 38 g l 0 02 and 0 4 bq m3 respectively are the values measured at depth below the mixing layer i table 3 figs 3 and 5 6 1 3 average water within the box estimating a representative value of the water within the conceptual box is more complicated due to the spatial variations in the calanque surface layer table 4 fig 1 the arithmetic means for the salinity 224ra 223ra 228th and 227ac data of the calanque were compared to the means weighted by the percentage of the total surface surrounding each station calculated using voronoi polygons within uncertainties 1σ standard deviation no significant differences were found between arithmetic and weighted means for either radium or salinity table 3 in the following the arithmetic means will be considered for all calculations table 3 6 2 estimating the karstic submarine groundwater discharge precision and accuracy of the method the flux of radium from the karstic submarine groundwater discharge rasgd can be estimated using equation 7 the flux of radium exported offshore raoff was calculated according to eqs 6 and 9 the apparent age of the calanque surface water tw eq 9 was 2 1 and 1 0 5 days for the sampling period of 2012 and 2014 meaning on average 1 1 day these results are similar to the water age estimated using 224ra and 228ra isotopes measured in port miou in 2009 0 7 1 6 days bejannin et al 2017 this result is also consistent with our approximation of using the ara values measured 1 day before the date of sampling in the calanque of port miou for the mass balance using these values of tw and the radium data ara reported in table 3 the calculation of raoff the flux of 223ra and 224ra between the calanque and the coastal area provide similar results for 2012 and 2014 within errors table 4 the terms of radium production raprod and decay radec in the box studied were calculated table 4 using the volume and the activities of 224ra 223ra 228th and 227ac for the calanque discussed in section 6 1 3 the different inputs and outputs of the radium mass balance in table 4 shows that a flux of radium needs to be added to compensate the loss by decay and export this radium flux rasgd may be ascribed to groundwater discharge the groundwater discharge of the karstic spring of port miou qsgd can therefore be calculated by dividing the flux of radium rasgd by the activity of the spring eq 8 table 4 the values obtained are very low arithmetic mean of 0 6 0 1 m3 s but significant within the errors propagated for all terms of the mass balance the fact that the mass balances calculated for 223ra and 224ra isotopes and for two different periods 2012 and 2014 are very similar is an argument that our approach is robust these values compare fairly well with the estimation made by bejannin et al 2017 on the same area but with 228ra they obtained a terrestrial groundwater flux of 0 6 1 2 m3 s using data collected in july 2009 however these values are significantly lower than the water discharge measured at the dam 0 6 0 1 versus 4 1 m3 s this is surprising because the radium mass balance integrates in the calanque all the inputs from the karstic aquifer including the small springs from the ne side as well as possible unknown springs if they have the same radium activities fig 1 therefore one should expect the qsgd value estimated with radium isotopes to be higher by at least a factor of 5 since the discharge measurement of qsgd at the dam is reliable to within 25 it appears that our estimation of the qsgd using the 223ra 224ra mass balance is precise but not accurate the radium mass balance approach has been commonly used in a large number of hydrological settings charette et al 2001 kim et al 2005 beck et al 2007 garcia solsona et al 2008b moore et al 2008 ollivier et al 2008 gattacceca et al 2011 garcia orellana et al 2014 baudron et al 2015 montiel et al 2018 it can be simplified by combining eqs 5 7 where the determination of qin and qout is not required another method based on the resolution of the water salt mass balance and the value of the spring discharge measured upstream the dam can be used to calculate the fluxes of water exchanged between the calanque and the coastal sea qin and qout see section 4 2 eqs 11 15 this approach is based on the difference in salinity and 224ra between the coastal water the calanque and the spring qin qout and qsgd were simulated using the values reported in table 3 for 2012 and 2014 in the range of their respective uncertainties all the solutions were calculated and the results show that the distribution of the solutions is a gaussian the mean qsgd is 0 2 m3 s for both the 2012 and 2014 campaigns fig 7 these results are consistent with the previous calculation based on ra mass balance only our results return very similar values when using different data sets 2012 2014 and both 223ra and 224ra this suggests that at least one parameter in eq 2 plays a key role in the estimation of qsgd independently of the radium and salinity measurements in the karstic spring the calanque of port miou and seawater we can question the estimation of the volume of the calanque v the depth of the layer at which the karstic groundwater mixes has been shown to vary between 1 and 2 m all the calculations were performed with a value of 1 5 m by propagating an error of 0 5 m on the calculation of qsgd we obtain a shift in qsgd value which at most reaches 0 8 m3 s another key parameter in solving eq 7 is the water residence time tw our results show that tw is short relative to the decay period of 224ra the very good correlation between 224ra and salinity fig 5 is another indication that mixing between the karstic springs and the water in the calanque is almost instantaneous our estimations of tw are not very precise tw 1 1 days propagating the error on tw has a strong impact on the calculated qsgd fig 8 shows that the calculated qsgd value follows an exponential decrease with increasing tw tw is taken to vary over the range 1 1 day the reference value of qsgd measured at the dam 4 1 m3 s is obtained for a residence time of c a 0 2 days which is about 5 h while for tw 1 day the qsgd simulated value is 1 m3 s in such cases where the water residence time is short the estimation of qsgd based on radium mass balance cannot be accurate finally the inaccuracy of the estimation may be associated to a particular hydrodynamic setting in this area we suggest that the water exchange between the calanque and the open sea is made through an output in the surface layer and an equivalent input in the deeper layer however the adcp profiles show that there is already an exchange within the deep layer with strong currents entering the calanque on the east and exiting on the west fig 6 it is thus possible that part of the entire discharge of the groundwater coming from the deep spring is entrained within this deep circulation and exits the calanque without feeding the surface layer in this case the sgd occurring in the surface water will be mainly or only due to the surface springs and this may explain the lower value obtained 7 conclusions in this work we have reported 223ra 224ra salinity profiles and current measurements in order to understand the degree of precision and accuracy with which we can estimate the submarine groundwater discharge of a main karstic spring discharging at 10 m depth in a cove the port miou calanque the cove water is consequently stratified as two different water masses can be distinguished the shallower water mass 1 5 m deep on average brackish and cool and the deeper water mass which displays the temperature and salinity characteristics of sea water water salinity and radium mass balances were performed in the shallower mixing box to estimate the submarine groundwater discharge qsgd the mean value obtained with 223ra and 224ra is precise but significantly lower 0 6 0 1 m3 s than direct measurements of the groundwater discharge available inland in the karst conduit 500 m upstream the main port miou submarine spring 4 1 m3 s the residence time of the cove water estimated using both 224ra and 223ra isotopes is very low 1 1 day first a high uncertainty for a low water residence time propagates exponentially onto the calculated qsgd second we suggest that the shape and geometry of the cove as well as the location of the discharge point of the spring play a key role in explaining these discrepant results the water circulation in the cove at the location of the karstic spring discharge favors the export of the groundwater in the deeper water mass and decreases the contribution of the karstic spring into the shallower mixing box that was considered for the mass balance calculations we therefore conclude that in such a stratified mediterranean cove the estimations of sgd based on short lived radium isotopes have to be used with caution if the circulation pattern of the cove water is not well understood declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
