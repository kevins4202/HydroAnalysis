23955,coupling between the atmosphere and ocean is scale dependent for example in the mid latitudes and at oceanic mesoscales spatial scales between 10 and hundreds of kilometers the air sea interactions are driven by the oceanic variability and the atmosphere responds to the changes in the sea surface temperature anomalies ssta which are created by fast oceanic advection this study explores these interactions using a regional high resolution atmosphere ocean coupled model with a realistic atmospheric component and a semi idealized oceanic model of a zonal flow the atmospheric component consists of two nested domains the inner domain fully coupled with the ocean model and the outer domain one way coupled with the observed sst two 2 year simulations are discussed here one in which the oceanic isopycnals are steep and ocean currents are strong strong currents or sc and another with less steep isopycnals and weaker currents weak currents or wc simulated mesoscale variability occurs on a wide range of spatial scales and we distinguish large mesoscale hundreds of kilometers and shorter and small mesoscale tens of kilometers and shorter anomalies the model is most applicable to the mid latitude southern ocean far from any boundaries relationships between atmospheric variables and ssta are studied using temporal correlations and coupling coefficients and for both large mesoscale and small mesoscale anomalies significant positive correlations between large mesoscale anomalies are found for following pairs of variables equivalent neutral stability ens 10 meter winds and ssta wind stress and ssta and wind stress divergence curl and ssta downwind crosswind gradients the temporal correlations are smaller for the small mesoscale anomalies the correlation coefficients are also higher for the model sc region whereas the corresponding coupling coefficients are higher in the model wc region among all pairs the coupling coefficients for the ens winds and ssta are the most consistent in time and various environmental conditions coupling coefficients for the wind stress and ssta show a nearly linear dependence on the ens wind speed as a result the reported variability in these coupling coefficients indicates a complex nonlinear relationship between the wind and sst anomalies our numerical analysis indicates strong presence of the vertical mixing mechanism involving the downward momentum mixing on both small and large mesoscales in contrast the active presence of the pressure adjustment mechanism in the marine boundary layer could not be confirmed on the spatial and time scales considered in this study graphical abstract 1 introduction the atmosphere and ocean interact on a wide range of spatial and temporal scales and these interactions modulate weather and climate variability as well as oceanic uptake of anomalous heat and carbon the mechanisms of these interactions were found to be scale dependent and the scales can be separated into the large scale order of 1000 km oceanic mesoscales order of 10 100 km and ocean sub mesoscales order of 1 10 km air sea interactions on long spatial scales are typically driven by the atmosphere with the slowly moving ocean responding to atmospheric variability cayan 1992 mantua et al 1997 xie 2004 at the oceanic mesoscales the variability is instead driven by the ocean and the atmosphere responds to the changes in the sea surface temperature anomalies ssta which are created by fast oceanic advection the work presented here focuses on the mid latitudes far from any continental boundaries as a manifestation of mesoscale atmosphere ocean coupling anomalies in the equivalent neutral stability ens wind wind stress and heat fluxes were found to be positively correlated with the ssta in observational studies liu et al 2000 chelton et al 2001 o neill et al 2003 xie 2004 and numerical modeling studies samelson et al 2006 skyllingstad et al 2005 2007 spall 2007 wu and kirtman 2007 small et al 2008 kirtman et al 2012 putrasahan et al 2013a b perlin et al 2014 kilpatrick et al 2014 2016 siqueira and kirtman 2016 seo 2017 laurindo et al 2018 this sst induced atmospheric response is explained by two primary mechanisms the first mechanism conventionally referred to as the vertical mixing mechanism vvm involves modulation of the vertical turbulent stress divergence over warm ssta it leads to enhancement of the vertical momentum transfer and strengthening of surface winds wallace et al 1989 hayes et al 1989 as a result the winds blowing along an sst front gain extra curl whereas the cross frontal winds acquire additional divergence chelton et al 2001 small et al 2005 bryan et al 2010 the second pressure adjustment mechanism pam lindzen and nigam 1987 involves the hydrostatic pressure gradient adjustment in the marine boundary layer mabl the pam mechanism yields low high surface pressure anomalies over the warm cold ssta and consequently wind convergence divergence it then could manifest itself through a relationship between atmospheric pressure laplacian and the wind convergence spall 2007 minobe et al 2008 lambaerts et al 2013 in the cross frontal flows mabl also may undergo deepening shoaling for the wind blowing from cold to warm warm to cold waters mahrt et al 2001 2004 skyllingstad et al 2005 2007 another mesoscale coupling mechanism although not considered in the present study is the feedback between surface ocean currents and wind stress e g dewar and flierl 1987 duhaut and straub 2006 seo et al 2016 oceanic mesoscale ssta are ubiquitous in the southern ocean where they include several prominent circumpolar fronts orsi et al 1995 multiple meandering mesoscale fronts maximenko et al 2005 thompson and sallee 2012 both stationary and transient as well as numerous coherent vortices and other propagating features the mean large scale westerlies blow parallel to the mean sst fronts but the air can move along sst gradients in frontal meanders and coherent vortices chelton et al 2004 describe filaments of divergence convergence of wind stress south of 40 s associated with frontal meanders which are especially large over major topographic features previous studies reveal relationship between ssta associated with coherent vortices atmospheric anomalies and air sea exchanges of heat and gases in several parts of the world ocean frenger et al 2013 villas bôas et al 2015 song et al 2015 putrasahan et al 2017 the effects of other forms of mesoscale variability such as transient meanders remain to be evaluated in the present study we introduce and analyze a fully coupled system in which ssta both affect and are affected by the atmosphere with the ocean atmosphere interaction occurring at the oceanic mesoscale the regional atmospheric model is configured over two selected regions of the southern ocean and provides realistic forcing the oceanic component is a generalized representation of a large scale zonal flow which has the main components of the real southern ocean large scale isopycnal slope stationary meanders and transient mesoscale anomalies this coupling approach leads to a flexible model specifically designed for studies of the air sea interactions at the oceanic mesoscale in this model implementation two way mesoscale air sea exchanges can be studied over the entire spectrum of realistic larger scale synoptic conditions and seasonal variability while the simplified oceanic geometry facilitates studies of the mesoscale dynamics in this paper we analyze the statistics of the dynamical coupling between sst winds and heat flux anomalies their range of variability and dependence on spatial scales our particular focus in this study is on the southern ocean both because of its large role in climate and because mesoscale variability is ubiquitous there but our conclusions are expected to be relevant to other parts of the world ocean 2 model description our regional ocean atmosphere model roam consists of atmospheric and oceanic components that exchange heat and momentum fluxes at the air sea interface the ocean component is forced at the surface by the atmospheric model whereas the regional atmospheric component is forced by a combination of model simulated and observed sst as well as by the lateral boundary conditions from the global analysis which ensures realistic large scale conditions 2 1 atmospheric component coamps the atmospheric component is the u s navy coupled ocean atmosphere mesoscale prediction system coamps v 4 2 2 hodur 1997 based on non hydrostatic fully compressible equations and a variety of physical parameterizations it uses arakawa c grid staggering for numerical scheme the current model setup uses mercator projection it includes a radiation scheme harshvardhan et al 1987 explicit moisture physics for nonconvective clouds and precipitation rutledge and hobbs 1983 and cumulus convective processes kain and fritsch 1993 for the grid spacings greater than 10 km planetary boundary layer pbl scheme in coamps is a turbulence 1 5 order closure 2 5 level scheme follows mellor and yamada 1982 and yamada 1983 the scheme solves the prognostic equation for the turbulent kinetic energy tke e u 2 v 2 w 2 2 where u v w are unresolved turbulent velocities in horizontal and vertical directions the tke prognostic equation is used in place of the velocity variances stull 1988 while the second moment statistical moments such as turbulent momentum fluxes u w v w the turbulent flux w θ and turbulent tke diffusion are parameterized in terms of turbulent eddy mixing coefficients k m k h and k e the boundary layer scheme computes all the fields needed for solving the tke prognostic equation including the boundary layer depth turbulent mixing scale length and flux richardson number calculates eddy coefficients and includes effects of clouds the full prognostic tke equation contains terms for the turbulent diffusion shear mechanical production buoyant production length scale dependent dissipation and horizontal advection the boundary layer depth is defined by the flux richardson number r i f a ratio of the buoyant production of tke to the shear tke production as the lowest model level when the r i f exceeds the critical value of 0 5 the surface layer follows louis 1979 and uno et al 1995 with modifications for water points to use the charnock estimation of surface roughness and the stability coefficients to match the coare 2 6 version algorithm fairall et al 1996 wang et al 2002 surface layer scheme provides boundary condition for the momentum heat and moisture fluxes between the model lowest level and the surface the scheme uses polynomial functions f m f h of the bulk richardson number to compute the surface sensible and latent heat fluxes and the surface momentum fluxes the bulk richardson number r i b g z δ θ u 2 θ involves δ θ an air sea temperature difference for the reference level z is a 10 m reference level g is a gravity acceleration u is the wind speed at a reference level of 10 m and θ is the mean potential temperature over the depth of the surface layer in a study of the agulhas return current perlin et al 2014 demonstrated that this coamps model combination of surface and pbl schemes produced an atmospheric response to ssta that compared favorably with quikscat wind observations their study quantified this response in terms of coupling coefficients which are also used in the present analysis the coamps model is formulated in two nested domains a larger outer domain at the 27 km horizontal resolution and a smaller inner domain at the 9 km resolution coamps in the outer domain is forced by the observed ssts one way coupling and provides lateral boundary conditions for the inner domain where the full two way coupling with the ocean model takes place the outer inner domain covers approximately 70 by 23 56 by 12 area in longitudinal and latitudinal extent respectively in the vertical direction both grids use the sigma coordinate system and their 49 layers stretch from the surface to nearly 20 km the current model time step is 72 s 24 s for the outer inner grids respectively lateral boundary conditions for the outer domain and initial conditions for both domains are derived from the 6 h 0 25 global ncep fnl final analysis and global forecast system gfs which are products of the global data assimilation system gdas http www ftp ncep noaa gov data nccf com gfs prod the boundary conditions are updated every 6 h for the outer model domain the nested model configuration is set up in two geographical locations in the southern hemisphere corresponding to distinct oceanic regimes a region with strong oceanic currents in a western indian sector strongcurrent or sc domain and the regions with relatively weak ocean currents in an eastern pacific sector weakcurrent or wc domain see fig 1 for the lower boundary condition the outer domain uses daily sst values from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa version 2 daily optimum interpolation oi analyses on a 0 25 grid reynolds et al 2007 the inner atmospheric domain is forced by the sst simulated by the ocean component described further below to smooth the transition between the two types of sst sources the inner domain employs a blending scheme that ensures a gradual transition between the roms simulated and observed sst values over 100 km region surrounding the ocean grid fig 2 the blending scheme that has been coded for this study combines the two sst sources and gives progressively higher weights from 0 to 1 to the satellite oi sst for the grid points further away from the ocean domain with the modeled sst an intermediate gridded domain with 2 5 km grid boxes equivalent to the ocean grid spacing is created in the model coupled software to assist the blending procedure this domain extends 40 grid points beyond the ocean grid boundaries for example the inner grid point of the perimeter region receives a weight of 1 for the boundary ocean model sst and a weight of 0 for the oi sst source the outer grid point of the perimeter region receives a weight of 0 for the ocean boundary sst and a weight of 1 for the oi sst the blended sst data is then interpolated into the nested atmospheric model grid using the coupler software regridding capability oi sst is used in the nested grid outside of that extended domain 2 2 ocean component roms the ocean component is a regional ocean modeling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 v3 r 830 the model represents a generalized zonal flow which the large scale stratification consistent with the corresponding geographical regions the model is formulated in the cartesian coordinates the domain is a zonally re entrant channel with the zonal length of 2800 km and the meridional width of 1120 km which at 45 s translate to approximately 35 7 by 10 1 of zonal and meridional extent respectively the spatial resolution of 2 5 km in both directions is expected to be sufficient for resolving dynamics at the first baroclinic rossby radius we can therefore expect a fully resolved mesoscale field and partially resolved large submesoscale features the maximum depth of the channel is 3000 m twenty five randomized gaussian shaped seamounts are added to the floor in order to keep the net zonal transport close to reasonable values pennel and kamenkovich 2014 their maximum height is 300 m and the gaussian width half the e folding scale is approximately 60 km there are 30 vertical layers in the ocean model stretched from the surface to the bottom according to terrain following sigma coordinates in order to keep the large scale meridional temperature and salinity gradients and the isopycnal slopes close to their real ocean values sponge layers are used within 7 grid points next to the northern and southern channel walls within these sponge layers the temperature and salinity are relaxed to analytical vertical profiles see appendix a with the restoring time scale increasing linearly from 5 days at each wall to 60 days at the 7th grid point away from the wall subgrid dynamics is parameterized by the laplacian viscosity and diffusivity with the 100 m2 s 1 coefficients kpp boundary layer scheme large et al 1994 is used for the surface and bottom boundary layers barotropic and baroclinic time steps 4 s and 120 s respectively to ensure the full development of the eddy field the ocean model was spun up prior to coupling using conventional restoring to time independent analytical target profiles at the surface appendix a the spin up has been carried out until the mesoscale variability reached statistical equilibrium as quantified by the total kinetic energy the length of the spin up is approximately 24 5 years for the wc case and 12 years for the sc case 2 3 coupling approach the coupling approach is similar to that described in perlin et al 2007 and warner et al 2008 except it is implemented using the earth system modeling framework esmf hill et al 2004 v7 1 0r the coupled system consists of the gridded components and a coupler component gridded components provide and receive the exchange fields shared with the other gridded components the atmospheric coamps and ocean roms are integrated into the esmf powered system as gridded components the third gridded component grid3 performs the blending of the sst fields and stores them for the use by the nested atmospheric domain see section 2 1 the esmf coupled component provides synchronization of the data exchange between the ocean and atmosphere components and the regridding capabilities the bilinear interpolation scheme is chosen for regridding of the exchange quantities the surface momentum heat and solar radiative fluxes are interpolated from the inner atmospheric grid to the ocean model grid the ssts from the ocean model are interpolated into the intermediated grid3 component where the blending with the observational oi sst is performed the resulting sst fields are provided to the nested atmospheric domain as the lower boundary condition freshwater fluxes do not come from the atmosphere and the restoring to the analytical profile is used instead section 2 2 and appendix a the coupling time step at which the data exchange is done is 18 min the analysis is based on 6 h instantaneous outputs several small islands and island clusters are present in the sc domain french southern and antarctic lands and isla de la possession the land masks for these islands are preserved in the atmospheric grids but are not present in the ocean grid these geographical points are excluded from the further model analysis following a year long spin up in the coupled regime the control runs started on 0000 utc 24 july 2015 and ended on 0000 utc 28 july 2017 ensuring two full years of coupled simulations in both geographic regions sst in the beginning of the control simulations for the entire modeling area is shown in fig 2 note that the sst in the outer atmospheric grid comes from observations the ocean model region dashed box in fig 2 displays mesoscale eddy features that have developed during the spin up these features are similar in size and magnitude to the sst anomalies in the noaa oi dataset shown for the region outside of the ocean domain partly due to the sponge layers at the ocean channel walls the large scale sst structure is also broadly consistent with observations with the sc case having notably stronger sst gradient compare to the wc case 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulated model fields and their time averaged statistics the time averaged zonal mean profiles of potential density referenced to the surface anomalies σ θ fig 3 show much steeper isopycnals in the sc case compare to the wc case this difference in the large scale stratification leads to stronger zonal currents and mesoscale activity in the sc case for example the net annual mean volume transport is approximately 40 and 140 sv in the wc and sc cases respectively mean meridional sst gradients black contours in fig 4a b are about 0 5 c 100 km in the wc case and about twice as strong 0 9 c 100 km in the sc case similar to sst 10 m atmospheric temperature shows predominantly zonal structure but with the meridional gradients twice as strong in the sc case black contours in fig 4c d prominent meridional mesoscale sst meanders have formed over the sc domain showing several ridge like patterns although these stationary meanders are likely to be a signature of the topography induced standing waves they are noticeably more pronounced in the sc case despite the topography being identical in both cases despite stronger oceanic currents and their variability in the sc case see the discussion of the ocean currents below the standard deviation of daily ssts σ sst color shading in fig 4a b computed relative to the 2 year average is generally smaller in the sc case than in the wc case these results suggest that higher sst variance in the wc case is explained by the action of the atmosphere rather than the oceanic processes for example σ sst is particularly large in the northwestern part of the wc domain which is consistent with the σ t a also being higher lower in the northwestern southeastern parts of the wc domain fig 4c d in the sc case the t a variability is more zonally uniform and some of the mean sst contours are co located with those seen in the σ sst field this structure indicates the importance of oceanic advection in the sst variability in the sc case the sc domain also exhibits σ sst that is weaker than in observations in the corresponding part of the indian sector which can be attributed to the use of an idealized re entrant channel which cannot reproduce powerful mesoscale eddies generated upstream from the sc region in the real ocean the resulting mesoscale air sea interactions are better outlined in the atmosphere ocean temperature difference dt sst t a fig 4e f and this field is notably different between the wc and sc cases there is little spatial variability in dt across the domain in the wc case where the mean dt varies between 0 5 and 1 0 c in contrast much greater spatial variability in dt is observed in the sc case where the time mean values range between 0 and 2 c exceeding 2 0 c in three distinct regions in northern part of the domain positive mean values black contours in fig 4f indicate atmospheric damping of the sst anomalies indicative of the ocean driven mesoscale coupling note also that high positive dt indicate strongly unstable conditions and thus stronger turbulent flux exchange can be expected likely leading to higher variability in the air temperatures in the sc case in agreement with the climatological data the model atmospheric winds are predominantly westerly in both domains as evidenced by wind stress τ vectors in fig 4g h in both the wc and sc cases the time averaged wind stresses and their standard deviations increase southward poleward and exhibit significant variability in the zonal direction both the mean fields and the spatial anomalies are approximately 15 25 stronger in the sc case than in the wc case and the largest difference is observed in the northern part of the domain where the variability is particularly large in the sc case spatial wind stress anomalies in the latter region are clearly co located with well defined dt anomalies indicating acceleration of surface winds in the regions with unstable atmospheric conditions vmm the dt anomalies are also co located with anomalies in the near surface atmospheric turbulent kinetic energy tke and turbulent air sea exchange fluxes of heat see fig 5 a f spatial correlations between these fields will be explored in detail in the next section here we only briefly discuss the main properties of the spatial distribution in these fields time mean values and standard deviations in the sensible shflx and latent lhflx turbulent heat fluxes fig 5a d positive upward show significant spatial variability that is noticeably larger in sc than in wc cases see also fig 4 e f and is larger in absolute terms in lhflx than in shflx similarly tke time mean and standard deviation fig 5g h exhibit well pronounced anomalies everywhere except the northern part of the wc domain both the time mean tke and its standard deviations are stronger in the sc case than in the wc case and the meridional departures in the mean tke contours in the sc case roughly coincide with the meandering fronts in sst suggesting the importance of the vmm daily average planetary boundary layer pbl heights fig 5g h show strong spatial irregularity consistent with the 1 d formation mechanism see section 2 1 ranges of spatial variability in the mean values across the domain are 750 900 m and are similar for the wc and sc cases note several local maxima outlined by 900 m isoline along the northern boundary of the sc domain which align with the surface heat flux maxima higher variability in the pbl height on the windward side of the domain can be partly due to the pbl adjustment to the transient synoptic scale systems and air masses entering the nested domain from the outer region since the pbl height is a 1 d local diagnostic quantity that depends on the local r i f see section 2 1 unlike the outer model grid the inner grid uses no subgrid cumulus parameterization and only resolved convection and moisture physics ocean surface currents fig 6a b are predominantly eastward but the mean streamlines exhibit strong meanders especially in the sc case and in the southern part of the wc domain the streamlines are roughly consistent with the mean sea surface height contours although deviations mostly explained by the ekman currents are notable in most of the domain surface currents are notably weaker in the wc case than in the sc case especially north of 46 47 s in the wc where the sea surface height gradient is nearly zero the flow is weak but highly variable in time along the northern boundary in the central part of the wc domain as shown by the standard deviations for the surface currents in fig 6 a b in contrast spatial gradients in the sea surface height and thus the surface geostrophic currents are more uniformly distributed in the sc domain the eddy kinetic energy eke is calculated next as e k e 0 5 u 2 v 2 where u and v are daily mean departures from the spatially smoothed horizontal velocities 300 km box sliding mean filter was used for the smoothing there are several regions of relatively high eke in the wc case and most of them are in the southern part of the domain where the mean flow is also stronger in the sc case particularly high e k e signal fig 6c d appears in the northern part over the regions with powerful meandering flows that also yield high heat flux anomalies fig 5a b the ocean mixed layer depth mld was estimated from daily average density profiles fig 6e f mld is defined as the depth at which the potential density referenced to the surface exceeds its surface value by 0 3 kg m 3 in both the wc and sc cases the annual mean values vary from about 50 to 150 m with the winter values exceeding 500 m in some locations not shown the standard deviations in mld show the spatial structure similar to the annual mean mlds in the wc case however the deepest mld is found in the southern part of the domain where the average currents are also the strongest it is the opposite in the sc case where the deepest values are in the northern part of the domain 3 2 mesoscale variability in the sst and its coupling with the atmosphere mesoscale oceanic features both stationary and transient are well developed in both the wc and sc simulations these mesoscale anomalies are generated by a combination of oceanic processes such as instability of the mean flow and its interactions with topography and atmospheric variability such as wind and heat flux anomalies as is discussed in the preceding section our wc and sc simulations exhibit very different ocean stratification sst and near surface currents the large scale atmospheric conditions are also different between the two cases the mesoscale ssta induce a noticeable atmospheric response and the resulting ocean atmosphere coupling depends on the amplitude and spatial scale of ssta as well as on the ambient atmospheric and oceanic conditions in this section we will study these dependencies focusing on general characteristics of ocean atmosphere interactions on the ocean mesoscale rather than on domain specific features 3 2 1 isolating mesoscale features the spatio temporal anomalies analyzed in this section are defined over a time interval long enough to represent interactions between synoptic atmospheric events and mesoscale oceanic anomalies a typical time scale of a synoptic atmospheric forcing is 2 5 days eskridge et al 1997 while earlier studies suggested using minimum of 10 days or more of averaging to quantify the effects of atmospheric wind response to the sst anomalies o neill 2012 we found that using a 5 day running averaging led to sufficiently robust results we first computed daily average values of the analyzed quantities to eliminate the diurnal cycle and then applied the running 5 day average to define spatial anomalies we used a 2 d loess smoother that was based on locally weighted quadratic regression schlax and chelton 1992 chelton and schlax 2003 the filter properties yield half power cutoff at corresponding values of its half span half size window high pass perturbations or anomalies used interchangeably were computed as local departures from the low pass filtered values two different filter windows were chosen to study the dependence of the atmosphere ocean coupling on a spatial scale the first filter has a half span of 10 5 in the longitudinal and latitudinal directions respectively this filter is labeled further in the text and figures as f1 and is similar to the filter used in other studies e g chelton et al 2004 putrasahan et al 2013a b seo et al 2016 the second filter f2 uses half span of 150 km 150 km and is intended to isolate features associated with the oceanic small scale mesoscale variability fig 7 shows the meridionally and time averaged zonal wavenumber spectra for the full fields and their f1 and f2 anomalies which allows us to examine the scale dependence in these fields and assess the performance of the filtering all spectra of the full fields are basically red with flattening at the long zonal scales of 400 1000 km spectral densities of the full sst and heat flux for the wc case are smaller than for the sc case at the wavenumbers greater the 0 09 0 1 cycles degree longitude 800 1000 km illustrating stronger spatial anomalies in the sc case regional differences between the wc and sc cases are even larger as confirmed by calculating the same spectra in the northern parts of the domain not shown in contrast the wind stress spectra are very close to each other in the wc and sc simulations despite ssta being stronger in the latter case these results are partially explained by the strong explicit dependence of the surface heat fluxes on dt and ssta whereas the coupling between winds and ssta is less pronounced application of the f1 and f2 filters limits spectral power at the length scales greater than the filter half width corresponding to about 785 km and 150 km for the f1 and f2 filters respectively for the f1 filter the peak in spectral power appears around 460 km while the power is reduced at longer wavelengths for the f2 filter the spectral power cut off occurs at the expected length scales of greater than 150 km note that the f1 filter whose full size window is comparable to the entire domain illuminates the peak around 400 500 km lengths a signal that could be noticed but is more obscured in the full spectra fields interestingly enough a well distinguished spectral peaks at 300 km wavelengths were found in the filtered oi sst data and modeled wind speeds in the region similar to our sc case except in a larger domain and with a larger filter size perlin et al 2014 analysis of different sst databases in another study song et al 2009 also indicated spectral peaks at the length scales of 300 500 km in the region of the agulhas return current this agreement between our results and other studies is encouraging according to the vmm local ssta should manifest themselves in wind stress anomalies a single day data that includes 5 day running averages of these fields in figs 8 9 serve as examples of the spatial structure of these anomalies and the relationship between them the wind stress anomalies and the ssta for the f1 filter fig 8a b are generally well defined with the most pronounced anomalies being co located the spatial scale of these perturbations varies between 1 and 5 degrees in latitude longitude the sc case has the largest sst and wind stress anomalies in the northern part of the domain around the areas with strong spatial variability in these time mean variables see section 3 1 the f2 filter fig 8c d yields weaker spatial features of notably smaller length scales and of elongated shapes the spatial correlation between the f2 wind stress anomalies and sstas is less pronounced than for the f1 anomalies many wind stress anomalies in the wc case do not have a clear correspondence to sstas although strong sstas in the northern part of the sc domain almost always correspond to wind stress perturbations as a result the spatial correlations between the single day fields in fig 8 yield 0 48 0 35 for the f1 f2 anomalies in wc case and 0 60 0 51 for the f1 f2 anomalies in the sc case lack of clear spatial alignment between the sstas and wind f2 anomalies in the wc domain and southern part of the sc domain could be explained by two reasons first small scale ssta are weak because the sst spectrum is red and the atmospheric response may not be well pronounced in the wc case this explanation is consistent with the fact that the wind sst correlation is rather strong in the northern half of the sc domain the atmosphere may also not be able to fully adjust to sstas on short spatial scales partly because of the horizontal advection by large scale winds and the finite time required for the vvm for example kilpatrick et al 2016 explored the mabl response in an idealized case of mid latitude sst front and along frontal winds and concluded on the importance of the advection in the mabl dynamics the time scale of the mabl response to ssta of o 10 min mahrt et al 2001 would lead to the down wind displacement of o 5 10 km in our case the displacement would have a more noticeable effect on the spatial correlations of the f2 anomalies than the f1 anomalies although we did not attempt to quantify this effect in our study as expected ssta and turbulent heat flux anomalies are co located for both the f1 and f2 filters and in the wc and sc simulations fig 9 heat fluxes also strongly depend on dt anomalies turbulent heat flux here is defined as a sum of the latent and sensible heat fluxes both flux components show similar spatial structure this colocation indicates a local relationship between ssta dt and air sea exchange of heat and is particularly clear in the northern part of the sc domain unlike the relationship between sstas and wind stress the ssta heat flux relationship is well pronounced even for weak f2 anomalies in the wc case 3 2 2 the sst induced atmospheric response and coupling coefficients a common way to quantify the strength of air sea coupling is through computing the coupling coefficients between various pairs of atmospheric and oceanic variables these coupling coefficients represent a measure of the sensitivity of mesoscale atmospheric adjustment to the ssta and are conventionally used to illustrate the vmm mechanism stronger weaker winds over warm cold ssta there are several important diagnostics for mesoscale air sea interaction such as coupling coefficients describing the sensitivity of the near surface atmospheric flow and other properties to the mesoscale ssta chelton et al 2001 chelton and xie 2010 o neill et al 2010 2012 in the current study we consider the coupling coefficients for wind stress and ssta equivalent neutral stability ens winds and ssta and turbulent fluxes and ssta two additional important types of coupling coefficients are also calculated and discussed in the supplemental information for the wind stress divergence and downwind sst gradient and for the wind stress curl and cross wind sst gradient o neill 2012 argued that the ens wind sst coupling coefficients provide more stable and reliable quantification of the wind sst coupling than those derived from the wind stress sst relationship turbulent heat flux and ssta coupling coefficients putrasahan et al 2013a can also illustrate the mechanism of the coupling positive correlation between the heat flux out of the ocean and ssta corresponds to atmospheric damping of ssta whereas the negative correlation suggests atmospheric driving the sst variability stronger winds also lead to larger air sea heat exchange and in the case of the atmosphere causing sst variability wind speed anomalies can be expected to be negatively correlated with ssta wind stress components are obtained from the model friction velocity u and 10 m wind directional components the ens wind is defined as 10 m wind with stability effects neglected and is then estimated as following 1 w 10 m n u k l n 10 z 0 where u is friction velocity k is von kármán constant and z 0 is the sea surface roughness length the variables u and z 0 come from the model surface flux parameterization scheme z 0 also includes charnock relation that accounts for high winds fairall et al 1996 the coupling coefficients were calculated using a binned linear regression of wind wind stress perturbations on the sstas the same method was used for other pairs of variables discussed in the supplementary information section the pairs of perturbations from the two dimensional 5 day averages as in fig 8 for the entire 2 year simulation were used note that using this binned method the magnitude of the coupling coefficient is not a reliable indication of how well the anomalies in two fields are co located and we analyze local correlations in time for that purpose only bins with population over 1000 are used to compute the binned regression values the bulk method for estimating the coupling coefficients is also used in order to understand factors that determine the strength of the coupling because a coupling coefficient is a linear regression coefficient it is related to the correlation coefficient between for example ssta and ens 10 m wind speed anomalies ρ u t storch and zwiers 1999 perlin et al 2014 2 s u ρ u t σ u σ t where σ u and σ t are the standard deviations of the ens 10 m wind speed anomalies and ssta respectively temporal correlations are further computed between the wind stress and ssta to address the familywise error rate we applied the false discovery rate fdr method and used the threshold probability for the fdr p f d r to define statistically significant correlation coefficients benjamini and hochberg 1995 wilks 2016 the fdr procedure requires a higher standard of smaller p values for testing multiple null hypotheses multiple locations that it would be for a single null hypothesis single location the null hypothesis in this case is the absence of significant correlation at a given probability α the fdr algorithm operates on the collection of p values from n local hypotheses tests and a chosen α f d r a local single hypothesis threshold value we used α f d r 0 05 initially the p values are estimated from individual null hypothesis tests and then subsequently sorted in the ascending order in such a way that p 1 p 2 p n for i 1 n this procedure results in a distribution of p values for a given number of n hypothesis tests furthermore additional quantity of i n α f d r is estimated for each sorted i index and then compared with the initially estimated p i values we let k be the largest i index for which p i i n α f d r the null hypotheses are then rejected for all the locations corresponding indices i 1 2 k a threshold is therefore determined as p f d r max i 1 n p i p i i n α f d r benjamini and hochberg 1995 cf eq 1 wilks 2016 cf eq 3 the correlations between the high passed wind stresses and ssta fig 10 colors are predominantly positive for the f1 filtered fields and persistently stronger for the sc case than for the wc case they average to 0 36 0 42 for the wc sc domain with nearly identical p f d r of 0 0497 0 0496 for small mesoscale f2 filtered anomalies fig 10 bottom row the correlation coefficients are reduced to 0 22 0 32 for the wc sc and p f d r 0 0435 0 0462 some parts of the domain show insignificant or even weakly negative correlations for f2 filtered fields with the exception of the northern part of the sc domain which is characterized by prominent mesoscale features and exhibits correlations range between 0 4 and 0 8 to demonstrate the differential ocean atmospherecoupling on the large scales and mesoscale we also computed the correlations between the full unfiltered fields of the wind stress and sst fig 10 contours the annual cycle was removed from the full fields prior to computing the correlations and the similar fdr approach has been applied note that the full fields are dominated by large scale features fig 7 and the corresponding wind sst relationships are primarily influenced by the air sea coupling on long spatial scales consistent with the expected atmospheric forcing driving the ocean response the full fields yield weak negative correlations over most of the locations averaged to 0 17 0 19 for the wc sc case with the p f d r 0 0409 0 0448 except for the few limited regions over the strong mesoscale features in the northern part of the sc domain where the values are weakly positive 0 2 in a similar way to the wind stress sstcorrelations the correlations were computed between the turbulent heat flux perturbations and ssta as well as between the corresponding full fields fig 11 correlations for the perturbations are high and positive for the mesoscale features 0 82 0 82 for the wc sc domain using the f1 filter and 0 69 0 78 for the f2 filter and p f d r 0 05 for all the correlations for the full fields are in contrast extremely small yielding 0 06 0 06 with p f d r 0 0147 0 0133 for the wc sc case the sc domain shows weakly positive correlations in the northern part similar to the wind sst coupling the lack of consistent positive temporal correlations suggests that the atmosphere drives the sst variability at long spatial scales the wind coupling coefficients were estimated next using the binned linear regression method for the ens wind and wind stress perturbations and ssta s u and s str fig 12 as in the case of the correlation coefficients the use of high pass filters with different spatial windows f1 and f2 allowed a limited scale dependency analysis large mesoscale anomalies filter f1 in all variables have wider range of values and higher variance within each bin than the small mesoscale anomalies this is true for both the wc and sc cases and all types of the coupling coefficients and is explained by lower magnitudes of small mesoscale ssta the s u and s str coefficients for all the domains are listed in table 1 coupling coefficients for wind stress divergence downwind sst gradient s dstr and wind stress curl cross wind sst gradient s cstr are also estimated using a similar approach and are shown in the supplemental information fig si 5 table si 1 also lists these additional coupling coefficients along with the domain average standard deviations for the corresponding variable pairs similar to table 1 the coupling coefficients are consistently higher for the wc case for all fields in table 1 in the inner atmospheric domain fully coupled regime this may seem surprising since the same variable pairs show higher correlations in the sc case table 1 and fig 10 to understand the causes of this contradiction we estimated the terms in the bulk formula eq 2 note that unlike the binned approach that excludes higher perturbation ssta outliers and less populated bins the bulk method estimates the correlations and standard deviations from all data values and may result in slight differences in coupling coefficient estimates which are discussed further as can be seen in table 1 the standard deviation of ssta is typically 2 3 times greater in the sc case than in the wc case whereas the standard deviations of the wind variables are less variant between the two simulations as a consequence the coupling coefficient is larger in the wc case despite the weaker correlation we further inspected the wind response over the sc domain by splitting it in two subdomains north and south of 44 s supplemental information table si 2 the results confirmed that higher temporal correlations are associated with larger σ sst and smaller coupling coefficients this effect is observed for all of the perturbation pairs except for the f2 filtered sst wind stress to evaluate the robustness of the conclusions table 1 also shows the coupling coefficients computed for the part of the outer atmospheric grid that covers the oceanic domain where the atmospheric model is forced by the observed sst oi sst and the atmospheric resolution is coarser than in the inner domain another important difference between the domains is that while the atmosphere ocean coupling is two way in the inner domain the ocean feedbacks are absent in the outer domain in agreement with the results in the inner domain two way coupling the correlations between the sst and wind variables in the outer domain one way coupling are consistently stronger in the sc case table 1 and table si 1 right half the difference between coupling coefficients between the wc and sc regions is however noticeably reduced in the outer domain one way coupling compare to the inner domain while s u continues to be higher in the wc case all other types of coupling coefficients show little differences between the wc and sc cases to further evaluate confidence intervals for different coupling coefficients the supplemental information table si 3 presents the statistics for all of the above estimations according to these estimates our main conclusion that s u is higher in the wc case than in the sc case is statistically robust for all the filters and inner outer domains in contrast the difference in s str between the wc and sc domains is statistically significant in the inner domain only with no similar conclusions made for the outer domain although the sst standard deviations σ t in eq 2 are very high in the outer sc domain the wind stress variance and the wind stress sst correlations are also higher leading to the similarity in s str between the outer wc and sc domain as discussed earlier correlations between the small mesoscale f2 filtered sst and wind anomalies are noticeably lower than between their large mesoscale f1 filtered counterparts the values of coupling coefficients differ for f1 and f2 but to a lesser extent as in the case of the wc and sc coupling coefficients eq 2 is used to study the terms defining the coupling coefficients both σ sst and σ w are noticeably smaller in the case of the f2 filtered anomalies than for the f1 filtered fields the difference between the scales is more pronounced for the ssta as could be confirmed from the wavenumber spectra fig 7 a b as a result the ratios of standard deviations in eq 2 are greater for the small mesoscale anomalies than for the large mesoscale ones f1 the product of the correlation coefficient lower for f2 and the standard deviation ratio higher for f2 thus explains similar coupling coefficients in both cases the coupling coefficient between turbulent heat fluxes and ssta s hfx shows little difference for both cases and both the small and large mesoscale anomalies fig 13 the difference between the two cases is much smaller than for the wind sst coupling this is consistent with the strong explicit dependence of the heat fluxes on dt and thus a more direct local turbulent heat flux response to the underlying sstas as opposed to the wind response which is governed by vmm and pam comparison to earlier estimates of the coupling coefficients could be more readily done for the sc case and the outer domain because of the use of observational oi sst data our analysis of the f1 filtered data produced s u 0 44 and s str 0 020 which are in a good agreement with the o neill et al 2012 values of 0 44 and 0 022 respectively calculated for the agulhas region from multi year quikscat scatterometer observations the perlin et al 2014 modeling study for a single month wintertime period over the agulhas regions reported s u 0 42 s str 0 022 and s u 0 38 s str 0 017 derived from the quikscat noaa oi sst data and from the uncoupled coamps simulations respectively the agreement confirms that the modeled response of the atmosphere to ssta in our study is realistic 3 2 3 variability in the coupling coefficients the previous section demonstrates that the s u and s str coupling coefficients are sensitive to the length scale of the spatial anomalies filter f1 vs filter f2 and differ between two geographical domains wc and sc in the fully coupled regime in this section we further examine the variability in the coupling coefficients in time and their sensitivity to the background conditions despite significant month to month variability in the wind sst coupling coefficients they show either a very weak or no annual cycle see the discussion in the supplemental information fig si 6 importantly all coupling coefficients maintain their sign throughout the year indicating that the ocean is forcing the atmosphere year around overall our results agree well with the findings reported in previous studies o neill et al 2012 putrasahan et al 2013a the coupling coefficients wind anomalies ssta and ssta gradients have been shown to vary with the wind speed byrne et al 2015 foussard et al 2019 to get a further insight into variability in the coupling coefficients we investigated their dependence on large scale winds in the wc and sc domains we first described the 10 m ens wind speeds and their variability using the weibull distribution which is considered to be a reasonably good fit to wind data takle and brown 1978 seguro and lambert 2000 fig 14a for this analysis we used the model data in both the wc and sc regions and both the outer one way coupling portion overlapping the roms domain and inner full coupling domains to determine the weibull fit parameters namely we estimated the amplitude a which can be viewed as a median value and the shape parameter k which can serve as a measure of variability see fig 14a the amplitudes of a are about 1 m s 1 greater for the sc region than for the wc region yielding 11 5 11 1 m s 1 and 10 6 10 3 m s 1 for the outer inner sc and wc domains respectively the sc domain exhibits greater variability as described by the shape parameter k the weibull fit for the cumulative probability distribution cdf can further help to identify the wind ranges of the most probable and extreme high low wind speeds for example weak wind speeds 4 m s appear to have the 3 5 of the cdf and the upper 4 5 i e above 95 96 cdf is populated by winds exceeding 15 m s 1 the range between 4 and 15 m s 1 is thus found in nearly 90 of the occurrences using the above results we estimated coupling coefficients for the three ens wind speed ranges weak winds 4 m s 1 mid range winds of 4 15 m s 1 and strong winds 15 m s 1 fig 14b the mid range of wind speeds consistently show the largest coupling coefficients compared to the extreme weak strong wind speed ranges for each individual domain or filter used the largest coupling coefficients for winds 4 m s 1 resulted for the f1 filter we next explore the dependence of s u and the terms in the bulk formula eq 2 on the ens wind speed fig 15 for this purpose we binned the background ens wind speeds and recalculated the coupling coefficients between the wind speed anomalies and sst s u and wind stress anomalies and ssta s str for the data points corresponding to each interval the s u coefficient for the f1 filtered values has a larger range in the wc case 0 38 0 54 than in the sc case 0 36 0 44 the s u coefficients from the f2 filtered data are more skewed decreasing for wind speeds stronger than 6 8 m s 1 this result could be explained by higher winds usually being associated with larger scale synoptic systems and are severely reduced by the f2 filter the s u coefficients for the weakest 3 m s 1 and strongest 19 22 m s 1 wind speeds are very similar for the sc and wc regions the correlation coefficients appear to have a dominant role in driving the s u dependence on the ens wind speeds than the other terms such as σ sst or σ w according to eq 2 and fig 15 c d the s str coupling coefficient exhibits a markedly different behavior from s u in most cases s str shows close to linear dependence on the ens wind speed increasing nearly two fold from the weakest to the stronger winds of 16 21 m s 1 the only exception is the f1 filtered wc data where s str decreases for the winds 16 m s 1 unlike the coupling coefficients the correlation coefficient between the wind stress and ssta fig 15e b dashed lines is very similar to the correlation coefficient between the ens wind speed and sst however a combination of the consistent increase in σ w and a slight decrease in σ sst with the ens wind speed yields a linear response of the s str these markedly different dependencies in s u and s str on the wind speed suggest a more complex relationship between the mesoscale wind stress anomalies and sstas it is possible that it is due to a negative feedback of the wind anomalies on sstas with stronger winds causing sst cooling 3 2 4 pressure adjustment mechanism vs vertical mixing mechanism our earlier analysis involving perturbations of winds momentum or turbulent fluxes addressed a local atmospheric response to the sstas on the basis of the vmm see section 1 we then examined whether another atmospheric response mechanism pam could take an active role in the atmospheric adjustment to the sstas as a basis of this pam mechanism the simple mabl model minobe et al 2008 predicts a correspondence between the wind convergence and the laplacian of the sea level pressure slp as a consequence this hydrostatic sea level pressure response leads to surface winds convergence given sufficient time and spatial scales to reach the equilibrium an example of the surface hydrostatic pressure anomalies and the ssta in fig 16 a d and other individual snapshots not shown indicate that occasional correspondence could be observed at times but the correlations are small and insignificant for large portions of the domain the domain average is 0 114 0 117 for the wc sc domain i e rather negligible for the scales analyzed here fig 16e f not shown for the f2 filtered data to further explore the presence of the pam we examine the correspondence between three variables the laplacian of slp the laplacian of the sst ssta and the surface wind convergence the temporal correlations between the surface wind convergence and the laplacian of the slp are predominantly positive fig 17a b with domain average of 0 48 0 40 and p f d r 0 0500 0 0497 for the wc sc case the correlations between the surface wind convergence and laplacian of sst with the negative sign are either insignificant or range between 0 2 and 0 2 and averaging to 0 06 0 09 and p f d r 0 0164 0 0174 for the wc sc domains fig 17c d somewhat similar values and ranges result for the laplacian of slp and the laplacian of the sst with the negative sign fig 17e f which average to 0 07 0 08 with p f d r 0 013 0 015 for the wc sc domain furthermore when these fields were not smoothed with the 5 day running average significant correlations were not found the statistics of the similar correlation coefficients for both domains and f1 f2 filters are shown in table 2 indicating that qualitatively the results are very similar for the wc and sc and for both f1 and f2 filters because the correspondence between pressure anomalies and wind anomalies could come from different processes and they are not correlated well with the ssta the pam mechanism therefore could not be confirmed for the spatial and temporal scales considered in this study note that earlier studies of the pam were focused on the frontal zones such as the kuroshio current putrasahan et al 2013a and longer time scales some recent studies of parfitt et al 2017 and parfitt and seo 2018 argued that the correspondence between these variables likely results from the accumulation of processes driven by mechanisms acting on synoptic scale rather than on a time mean scale 4 discussion and conclusions this study presents a regional midlatitude high resolution atmosphere ocean coupled model of intermediate complexity with a realistic atmospheric component and a semi idealized oceanic model of zonal flow this fully coupled model is designed for studies of the atmosphere ocean interactions at the scales from tens to several hundreds of kilometers and is flexible with respect to choosing atmospheric and oceanic conditions the atmospheric model consists of two nested domains the inner domain fully coupled with the ocean model and the outer domain one way coupled with the observed sst our analysis focuses on two simulations one in which the oceanic isopycnals are steep and ocean currents are strong strong currents or sc and another with less steep isopycnals and weaker currents weak currents or wc the wc domain has weaker atmospheric winds and variability than the sc domain simulated mesoscale variability in the ocean includes meandering eastward currents as well as transient anomalies generated due to a combination of intrinsic instability of the oceanic flow and synoptic atmospheric forcing these anomalies occur on a wide range of spatial scales and we distinguish large mesoscale several hundreds of kilometers and small mesoscale tens of kilometers anomalies the atmosphere ocean coupling over these large mesoscale and small mesoscale anomalies is the main topic of this study our analysis quantifies the strength of the coupling between the wind wind stress and sst we concluded that this coupling is governed by the vertical mixing mechanism vmm which implies acceleration of winds over warm ssta in agreement with the vmm large mesoscale ssta and their gradients are well correlated with the ens 10 m surface winds as well as with the wind stress and its curl divergence at the statistically significant level in contrast to this high spatial coherency the temporal correlations were smaller for the small mesoscale anomalies and nearly zero for the large scale unfiltered fields for the small mesoscale features the lack of correlation is most likely explained by the apparent inability of the atmosphere to adjust to features on short spatial and temporal scales and overall weakness of small scale ssta turbulent heat flux anomalies are notably better correlated with the ssta than are the wind and wind stress which is not surprising given strong dependence of these heat fluxes on the atmosphere ocean temperature difference in agreement with previous studies strong positive correlation between the heat flux anomalies and ssta indicates that the ocean is driving the thermal coupling at the mesoscale whereas the correlation is weak or negative at large scales the atmosphere ocean coupling is further quantified in terms of coupling coefficients calculated using a binned linear regression of the wind perturbations on ssta interestingly the fully coupled wc domain yields consistently stronger coupling coefficients than the sc domain for the ens 10 m winds ssta s u and for the wind stress ssta s str despite having lower correlations between the same pairs of variables this occurs due to the ratio of the wind perturbation variances to ssta variances being larger in the wc case and implies that similar sstas are expected to generate a stronger wind response in the wc domain furthermore small mesoscale fields produce consistently lower coupling coefficients a result statistically significant across all the coupling statistics and different methods of their estimation and in all domains finally oceanic feedbacks on sst generated atmospheric anomalies can be estimated by our comparison between one way and two way coupled model domains for example the difference in the coupling coefficients between the wc and sc regions is reduced in the outer model domain where no oceanic feedbacks are allowed this result however can also be partially due to a coarser model resolution in this region significant variability in the coupling coefficients indicates a complex nonlinear relationship between the wind and sst anomalies which can manifest itself in the dependence of the coupling coefficients on sst and winds the lack of a clear annual cycle suggests that the temporal variability in the wind sst coupling coefficients was not due to the large scale sst which has a clear annual cycle further analysis of s u and s str dependence on the ens 10 m wind speeds shows that for the mid range of wind speeds the s u shows less variability across the range whereas we find substantial nearly linear dependence of the s str coupling coefficient on the wind speed this difference is consistent with the wind stress being a quadratic function of the wind speed for very weak and very strong winds the dependence is less definite which may have several explanations for the weakest winds weaker coupling could be explained by a decreased mixing and increased static stability that dampens the atmospheric response regardless of the underlying conditions and geographic location for the strong winds and corresponding highly turbulent conditions in a deeper mabl the horizontal advection term or surface cooling may start to play an increasingly larger role in turbulent flux exchange thus decreasing the dependence on local sst anomalies from the ocean perspective transfer of higher momentum into the oceanic mixed layer could also enhance the horizontal advection on mesoscales or mixed layer deepening which may act to reduce the local sst anomalies note that a more detailed exploration of the sensitivity of the coupling coefficients to a full range of environmental parameters is beyond the scope of the current study among other studies that explored the scale dependence of the ocean atmosphere interaction laurindo et al 2018 presented spatio temporal scale analysis of the correlations between the sst and wind speeds their study explored the transition from negative correlations at large scales to positive correlations at the oceanic mesoscale and found the transition scale to coinside with the atmospheric first baroclinic rossby radius of deformation for the scales analyzed in our study we found a reduction of temporal correlations from overwhelmingly positive for the large mesoscale perturbations to weak positive at the small scale mesoscales our analysis could not demonstrate the importance of the pressure adjustment mechanism pam it is possible that this finding is specific for our study as the pam mechanism has been shown to be important in strong frontal zones e g putrasahan et al 2013a where it results from the accumulation of processes of synoptic scales parfitt et al 2017 parfitt and seo 2018 a study by oerder et al 2016 focused on mesoscale sst wind stress coupling in the peru chile current system concluded that wind stress anomalies are primarily forced by sstas their momentum balance found negligible contribution of the near surface pressure anomalies as compared to the turbulent momentum mixing vmm into the surface wind acceleration small contribution of the surface pressure anomalies was attributed to the back pressure effect related to the air temperature inversion a more idealized numerical study by kilpatrick et al 2014 that focused on boundary layer effects under the condition of strong winds crossing the mid latitude sst front also concluded that the mabl response directly above the front is dominated by the physics consistent with the vmms in conclusion this model is a convenient tool for studies of the atmosphere ocean coupling at the scales from tens to hundreds of kilometers relatively high resolution of 2 5 km in the ocean allows adequate resolution of the oceanic rossby deformation radius whereas the atmospheric resolution of 9 km permits using explicitly resolved moist physics for convective processes associated with the synoptic and associated mesoscale forcing further analysis of these numerical simulations is underway to study the ocean mixed layer heat budget and heat transport by the mesoscale ocean currents in the mixed layer credit authorship contribution statement

23955,coupling between the atmosphere and ocean is scale dependent for example in the mid latitudes and at oceanic mesoscales spatial scales between 10 and hundreds of kilometers the air sea interactions are driven by the oceanic variability and the atmosphere responds to the changes in the sea surface temperature anomalies ssta which are created by fast oceanic advection this study explores these interactions using a regional high resolution atmosphere ocean coupled model with a realistic atmospheric component and a semi idealized oceanic model of a zonal flow the atmospheric component consists of two nested domains the inner domain fully coupled with the ocean model and the outer domain one way coupled with the observed sst two 2 year simulations are discussed here one in which the oceanic isopycnals are steep and ocean currents are strong strong currents or sc and another with less steep isopycnals and weaker currents weak currents or wc simulated mesoscale variability occurs on a wide range of spatial scales and we distinguish large mesoscale hundreds of kilometers and shorter and small mesoscale tens of kilometers and shorter anomalies the model is most applicable to the mid latitude southern ocean far from any boundaries relationships between atmospheric variables and ssta are studied using temporal correlations and coupling coefficients and for both large mesoscale and small mesoscale anomalies significant positive correlations between large mesoscale anomalies are found for following pairs of variables equivalent neutral stability ens 10 meter winds and ssta wind stress and ssta and wind stress divergence curl and ssta downwind crosswind gradients the temporal correlations are smaller for the small mesoscale anomalies the correlation coefficients are also higher for the model sc region whereas the corresponding coupling coefficients are higher in the model wc region among all pairs the coupling coefficients for the ens winds and ssta are the most consistent in time and various environmental conditions coupling coefficients for the wind stress and ssta show a nearly linear dependence on the ens wind speed as a result the reported variability in these coupling coefficients indicates a complex nonlinear relationship between the wind and sst anomalies our numerical analysis indicates strong presence of the vertical mixing mechanism involving the downward momentum mixing on both small and large mesoscales in contrast the active presence of the pressure adjustment mechanism in the marine boundary layer could not be confirmed on the spatial and time scales considered in this study graphical abstract 1 introduction the atmosphere and ocean interact on a wide range of spatial and temporal scales and these interactions modulate weather and climate variability as well as oceanic uptake of anomalous heat and carbon the mechanisms of these interactions were found to be scale dependent and the scales can be separated into the large scale order of 1000 km oceanic mesoscales order of 10 100 km and ocean sub mesoscales order of 1 10 km air sea interactions on long spatial scales are typically driven by the atmosphere with the slowly moving ocean responding to atmospheric variability cayan 1992 mantua et al 1997 xie 2004 at the oceanic mesoscales the variability is instead driven by the ocean and the atmosphere responds to the changes in the sea surface temperature anomalies ssta which are created by fast oceanic advection the work presented here focuses on the mid latitudes far from any continental boundaries as a manifestation of mesoscale atmosphere ocean coupling anomalies in the equivalent neutral stability ens wind wind stress and heat fluxes were found to be positively correlated with the ssta in observational studies liu et al 2000 chelton et al 2001 o neill et al 2003 xie 2004 and numerical modeling studies samelson et al 2006 skyllingstad et al 2005 2007 spall

induced atmospheric response is explained by two primary mechanisms the first mechanism conventionally referred to as the vertical mixing mechanism vvm involves modulation of the vertical turbulent stress divergence over warm ssta it leads to enhancement of the vertical momentum transfer and strengthening of surface winds wallace et al 1989 hayes et al 1989 as a result the winds blowing along an sst front gain extra curl whereas the cross frontal winds acquire additional divergence chelton et al 2001 small et al 2005 bryan et al 2010 the second pressure adjustment mechanism pam lindzen and nigam 1987 involves the hydrostatic pressure gradient adjustment in the marine boundary layer mabl the pam mechanism yields low high surface pressure anomalies over the warm cold ssta and consequently wind convergence divergence it then could manifest itself through a relationship between atmospheric pressure laplacian and the wind convergence spall 2007 minobe et al 2008 lambaerts et al 2013 in the cross frontal flows mabl also may undergo deepening shoaling for the wind blowing from cold to warm warm to cold waters mahrt et al 2001 2004 skyllingstad et al 2005 2007 another mesoscale coupling mechanism although not considered in the present study is the feedback between surface ocean currents and wind stress e g dewar and flierl 1987 duhaut and straub 2006 seo et al 2016 oceanic mesoscale ssta are ubiquitous in the southern ocean where they include several prominent circumpolar fronts orsi et al 1995 multiple meandering mesoscale fronts maximenko et al 2005 thompson and sallee 2012 both stationary and transient as well as numerous coherent vortices and other propagating features the mean large scale westerlies blow parallel to the mean sst fronts but the air can move along sst gradients in frontal meanders and coherent vortices chelton et al 2004 describe filaments of divergence convergence of wind stress south of 40 s associated with frontal meanders which are especially large over major topographic features previous studies reveal relationship between ssta associated with coherent vortices atmospheric anomalies and air sea exchanges of heat and gases in several parts of the world ocean frenger et al 2013 villas bôas et al 2015 song et al 2015 putrasahan et al 2017 the effects of other forms of mesoscale variability such as transient meanders remain to be evaluated in the present study we introduce and analyze a fully coupled system in which ssta both affect and are affected by the atmosphere with the ocean atmosphere interaction occurring at the oceanic mesoscale the regional atmospheric model is configured over two selected regions of the southern ocean and provides realistic forcing the oceanic component is a generalized representation of a large scale zonal flow which has the main components of the real southern ocean large scale isopycnal slope stationary meanders and transient mesoscale anomalies this coupling approach leads to a flexible model specifically designed for studies of the air sea interactions at the oceanic mesoscale in this model implementation two way mesoscale air sea exchanges can be studied over the entire spectrum of realistic larger scale synoptic conditions and seasonal variability while the simplified oceanic geometry facilitates studies of the mesoscale dynamics in this paper we analyze the statistics of the dynamical coupling between sst winds and heat flux anomalies their range of variability and dependence on spatial scales our particular focus in this study is on the southern ocean both because of its large role in climate and because mesoscale variability is ubiquitous there but our conclusions are expected to be relevant to other parts of the world ocean 2 model description our regional ocean atmosphere model roam consists of atmospheric and oceanic components that exchange heat and momentum fluxes at the air sea interface the ocean component is forced at the surface by the atmospheric model whereas the regional atmospheric component is forced by a combination of model simulated and observed sst as well as by the lateral boundary conditions from the global analysis which ensures realistic large scale conditions 2 1 atmospheric component coamps the atmospheric component is the u s navy coupled ocean atmosphere mesoscale prediction system coamps v 4 2 2 hodur 1997 based on non hydrostatic fully compressible equations and a variety of physical parameterizations it uses arakawa c grid staggering for numerical scheme the current model setup uses mercator projection it includes a radiation scheme harshvardhan et al 1987 explicit moisture physics for nonconvective clouds and precipitation rutledge and hobbs 1983 and cumulus convective processes kain and fritsch 1993 for the grid spacings greater than 10 km planetary boundary layer pbl scheme in coamps is a turbulence 1 5 order closure 2 5 level scheme follows mellor and yamada 1982 and yamada 1983 the scheme solves the prognostic equation for the turbulent kinetic energy tke e u 2 v 2 w 2 2 where u v w are unresolved turbulent velocities in horizontal and vertical directions the tke prognostic equation is used in place of the velocity variances stull 1988 while the second moment statistical moments such as turbulent momentum fluxes u w v w the turbulent flux w θ and turbulent tke diffusion are parameterized in terms of turbulent eddy mixing coefficients k m k h and k e the boundary layer scheme computes all the fields needed for solving the tke prognostic equation including the boundary layer depth turbulent mixing scale length and flux richardson number calculates eddy coefficients and includes effects of clouds the full prognostic tke equation contains terms for the turbulent diffusion shear mechanical production buoyant production length scale dependent dissipation and horizontal advection the boundary layer depth is defined by the flux richardson number r i f a ratio of the buoyant production of tke to the shear tke production as the lowest model level when the r i f exceeds the critical value of 0 5 the surface layer follows louis 1979 and uno et al 1995 with modifications for water points to use the charnock estimation of surface roughness and the stability coefficients to match the coare 2 6 version algorithm fairall et al 1996 wang et al 2002 surface layer scheme provides boundary condition for the momentum heat and moisture fluxes between the model lowest level and the surface the scheme uses polynomial functions f m f h of the bulk richardson number to compute the surface sensible and latent heat fluxes and the surface momentum fluxes the bulk richardson number r i b g z δ θ u 2 θ involves δ θ an air sea temperature difference for the reference level z is a 10 m reference level g is a gravity acceleration u is the wind speed at a reference level of 10 m and θ is the mean potential temperature over the depth of the surface layer in a study of the agulhas return current perlin et al 2014 demonstrated that this coamps model combination of surface and pbl schemes produced an atmospheric response to ssta that compared favorably with quikscat wind observations their study quantified this response in terms of coupling coefficients which are also used in the present analysis the coamps model is formulated in two nested domains a larger outer domain at the 27 km horizontal resolution and a smaller inner domain at the 9 km resolution coamps in the outer domain is forced by the observed ssts one way coupling and provides lateral boundary conditions for the inner domain where the full two way coupling with the ocean model takes place the outer inner domain covers approximately 70 by 23 56 by 12 area in longitudinal and latitudinal extent respectively in the vertical direction both grids use the sigma coordinate system and their 49 layers stretch from the surface to nearly 20 km the current model time step is 72 s 24 s for the outer inner grids respectively lateral boundary conditions for the outer domain and initial conditions for both domains are derived from the 6 h 0 25 global ncep fnl final analysis and global forecast system gfs which are products of the global data assimilation system gdas http www ftp ncep noaa gov data nccf com gfs prod the boundary conditions are updated every 6 h for the outer model domain the nested model configuration is set up in two geographical locations in the southern hemisphere corresponding to distinct oceanic regimes a region with strong oceanic currents in a western indian sector strongcurrent or sc domain and the regions with relatively weak ocean currents in an eastern pacific sector weakcurrent or wc domain see fig 1 for the lower boundary condition the outer domain uses daily sst values from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa version 2 daily optimum interpolation oi analyses on a 0 25 grid reynolds et al 2007 the inner atmospheric domain is forced by the sst simulated by the ocean component described further below to smooth the transition between the two types of sst sources the inner domain employs a blending scheme that ensures a gradual transition between the roms simulated and observed sst values over 100 km region surrounding the ocean grid fig 2 the blending scheme that has been coded for this study combines the two sst sources and gives progressively higher weights from 0 to 1 to the satellite oi sst for the grid points further away from the ocean domain with the modeled sst an intermediate gridded domain with 2 5 km grid boxes equivalent to the ocean grid spacing is created in the model coupled software to assist the blending procedure this domain extends 40 grid points beyond the ocean grid boundaries for example the inner grid point of the perimeter region receives a weight of 1 for the boundary ocean model sst and a weight of 0 for the oi sst source the outer grid point of the perimeter region receives a weight of 0 for the ocean boundary sst and a weight of 1 for the oi sst the blended sst data is then interpolated into the nested atmospheric model grid using the coupler software regridding capability oi sst is used in the nested grid outside of that extended domain 2 2 ocean component roms the ocean component is a regional ocean modeling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 v3 r 830 the model represents a generalized zonal flow which the large scale stratification consistent with the corresponding geographical regions the model is formulated in the cartesian coordinates the domain is a zonally re entrant channel with the zonal length of 2800 km and the meridional width of 1120 km which at 45 s translate to approximately 35 7 by 10 1 of zonal and meridional extent respectively the spatial resolution of 2 5 km in both directions is expected to be sufficient for resolving dynamics at the first baroclinic rossby radius we can therefore expect a fully resolved mesoscale field and partially resolved large submesoscale features the maximum depth of the channel is 3000 m twenty five randomized gaussian shaped seamounts are added to the floor in order to keep the net zonal transport close to reasonable values pennel and kamenkovich 2014 their maximum height is 300 m and the gaussian width half the e folding scale is approximately 60 km there are 30 vertical layers in the ocean model stretched from the surface to the bottom according to terrain following sigma coordinates in order to keep the large scale meridional temperature and salinity gradients and the isopycnal slopes close to their real ocean values sponge layers are used within 7 grid points next to the northern and southern channel walls within these sponge layers the temperature and salinity are relaxed to analytical vertical profiles see appendix a with the restoring time scale increasing linearly from 5 days at each wall to 60 days at the 7th grid point away from the wall subgrid dynamics is parameterized by the laplacian viscosity and diffusivity with the 100 m2 s 1 coefficients kpp boundary layer scheme large et al 1994 is used for the surface and bottom boundary layers barotropic and baroclinic time steps 4 s and 120 s respectively to ensure the full development of the eddy field the ocean model was spun up prior to coupling using conventional restoring to time independent analytical target profiles at the surface appendix a the spin up has been carried out until the mesoscale variability reached statistical equilibrium as quantified by the total kinetic energy the length of the spin up is approximately 24 5 years for the wc case and 12 years for the sc case 2 3 coupling approach the coupling approach is similar to that described in perlin et al 2007 and warner et al 2008 except it is implemented using the earth system modeling framework esmf hill et al 2004 v7 1 0r the coupled system consists of the gridded components and a coupler component gridded components provide and receive the exchange fields shared with the other gridded components the atmospheric coamps and ocean roms are integrated into the esmf powered system as gridded components the third gridded component grid3 performs the blending of the sst fields and stores them for the use by the nested atmospheric domain see section 2 1 the esmf coupled component provides synchronization of the data exchange between the ocean and atmosphere components and the regridding capabilities the bilinear interpolation scheme is chosen for regridding of the exchange quantities the surface momentum heat and solar radiative fluxes are interpolated from the inner atmospheric grid to the ocean model grid the ssts from the ocean model are interpolated into the intermediated grid3 component where the blending with the observational oi sst is performed the resulting sst fields are provided to the nested atmospheric domain as the lower boundary condition freshwater fluxes do not come from the atmosphere and the restoring to the analytical profile is used instead section 2 2 and appendix a the coupling time step at which the data exchange is done is 18 min the analysis is based on 6 h instantaneous outputs several small islands and island clusters are present in the sc domain french southern and antarctic lands and isla de la possession the land masks for these islands are preserved in the atmospheric grids but are not present in the ocean grid these geographical points are excluded from the further model analysis following a year long spin up in the coupled regime the control runs started on 0000 utc 24 july 2015 and ended on 0000 utc 28 july 2017 ensuring two full years of coupled simulations in both geographic regions sst in the beginning of the control simulations for the entire modeling area is shown in fig 2 note that the sst in the outer atmospheric grid comes from observations the ocean model region dashed box in fig 2 displays mesoscale eddy features that have developed during the spin up these features are similar in size and magnitude to the sst anomalies in the noaa oi dataset shown for the region outside of the ocean domain partly due to the sponge layers at the ocean channel walls the large scale sst structure is also broadly consistent with observations with the sc case having notably stronger sst gradient compare to the wc case 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulated model fields and their time averaged statistics the time averaged zonal mean profiles of potential density referenced to the surface anomalies σ θ fig 3 show much steeper isopycnals in the sc case compare to the wc case this difference in the large scale stratification leads to stronger zonal currents and mesoscale activity in the sc case for example the net annual mean volume transport is approximately 40 and 140 sv in the wc and sc cases respectively mean meridional sst gradients black contours in fig 4a b are about 0 5 c 100 km in the wc case and about twice as strong 0 9 c 100 km in the sc case similar to sst 10 m atmospheric temperature shows predominantly zonal structure but with the meridional gradients twice as strong in the sc case black contours in fig 4c d prominent meridional mesoscale sst meanders have formed over the sc domain showing several ridge like patterns although these stationary meanders are likely to be a signature of the topography induced standing waves they are noticeably more pronounced in the sc case despite the topography being identical in both cases despite stronger oceanic currents and their variability in the sc case see the discussion of the ocean currents below the standard deviation of daily ssts σ sst color shading in fig 4a b computed relative to the 2 year average is generally smaller in the sc case than in the wc case these results suggest that higher sst variance in the wc case is explained by the action of the atmosphere rather than the oceanic processes for example σ sst is particularly large in the northwestern part of the wc domain which is consistent with the σ t a also being higher lower in the northwestern southeastern parts of the wc domain fig 4c d in the sc case the t a variability is more zonally uniform and some of the mean sst contours are co located with those seen in the σ sst field this structure indicates the importance of oceanic advection in the sst variability in the sc case the sc domain also exhibits σ sst that is weaker than in observations in the corresponding part of the indian sector which can be attributed to the use of an idealized re entrant channel which cannot reproduce powerful mesoscale eddies generated upstream from the sc region in the real ocean the resulting mesoscale air sea interactions are better outlined in the atmosphere ocean temperature difference dt sst t a fig 4e f and this field is notably different between the wc and sc cases there is little spatial variability in dt across the domain in the wc case where the mean dt varies between 0 5 and 1 0 c in contrast much greater spatial variability in dt is observed in the sc case where the time mean values range between 0 and 2 c exceeding 2 0 c in three distinct regions in northern part of the domain positive mean values black contours in fig 4f indicate atmospheric damping of the sst anomalies indicative of the ocean driven mesoscale coupling note also that high positive dt indicate strongly unstable conditions and thus stronger turbulent flux exchange can be expected likely leading to higher variability in the air temperatures in the sc case in agreement with the climatological data the model atmospheric winds are predominantly westerly in both domains as evidenced by wind stress τ vectors in fig 4g h in both the wc and sc cases the time averaged wind stresses and their standard deviations increase southward poleward and exhibit significant variability in the zonal direction both the mean fields and the spatial anomalies are approximately 15 25 stronger in the sc case than in the wc case and the largest difference is observed in the northern part of the domain where the variability is particularly large in the sc case spatial wind stress anomalies in the latter region are clearly co located with well defined dt anomalies indicating acceleration of surface winds in the regions with unstable atmospheric conditions vmm the dt anomalies are also co located with anomalies in the near surface atmospheric turbulent kinetic energy tke and turbulent air sea exchange fluxes of heat see fig 5 a f spatial correlations between these fields will be explored in detail in the next section here we only briefly discuss the main properties of the spatial distribution in these fields time mean values and standard deviations in the sensible shflx and latent lhflx turbulent heat fluxes fig 5a d positive upward show significant spatial variability that is noticeably larger in sc than in wc cases see also fig 4 e f and is larger in absolute terms in lhflx than in shflx similarly tke time mean and standard deviation fig 5g h exhibit well pronounced anomalies everywhere except the northern part of the wc domain both the time mean tke and its standard deviations are stronger in the sc case than in the wc case and the meridional departures in the mean tke contours in the sc case roughly coincide with the meandering fronts in sst suggesting the importance of the vmm daily average planetary boundary layer pbl heights fig 5g h show strong spatial irregularity consistent with the 1 d formation mechanism see section 2 1 ranges of spatial variability in the mean values across the domain are 750 900 m and are similar for the wc and sc cases note several local maxima outlined by 900 m isoline along the northern boundary of the sc domain which align with the surface heat flux maxima higher variability in the pbl height on the windward side of the domain can be partly due to the pbl adjustment to the transient synoptic scale systems and air masses entering the nested domain from the outer region since the pbl height is a 1 d local diagnostic quantity that depends on the local r i f see section 2 1 unlike the outer model grid the inner grid uses no subgrid cumulus parameterization and only resolved convection and moisture physics ocean surface currents fig 6a b are predominantly eastward but the mean streamlines exhibit strong meanders especially in the sc case and in the southern part of the wc domain the streamlines are roughly consistent with the mean sea surface height contours although deviations mostly explained by the ekman currents are notable in most of the domain surface currents are notably weaker in the wc case than in the sc case especially north of 46 47 s in the wc where the sea surface height gradient is nearly zero the flow is weak but highly variable in time along the northern boundary in the central part of the wc domain as shown by the standard deviations for the surface currents in fig 6 a b in contrast spatial gradients in the sea surface height and thus the surface geostrophic currents are more uniformly distributed in the sc domain the eddy kinetic energy eke is calculated next as e k e 0 5 u 2 v 2 where u and v are daily mean departures from the spatially smoothed horizontal velocities 300 km box sliding mean filter was used for the smoothing there are several regions of relatively high eke in the wc case and most of them are in the southern part of the domain where the mean flow is also stronger in the sc case particularly high e k e signal fig 6c d appears in the northern part over the regions with powerful meandering flows that also yield high heat flux anomalies fig 5a b the ocean mixed layer depth mld was estimated from daily average density profiles fig 6e f mld is defined as the depth at which the potential density referenced to the surface exceeds its surface value by 0 3 kg m 3 in both the wc and sc cases the annual mean values vary from about 50 to 150 m with the winter values exceeding 500 m in some locations not shown the standard deviations in mld show the spatial structure similar to the annual mean mlds in the wc case however the deepest mld is found in the southern part of the domain where the average currents are also the strongest it is the opposite in the sc case where the deepest values are in the northern part of the domain 3 2 mesoscale variability in the sst and its coupling with the atmosphere mesoscale oceanic features both stationary and transient are well developed in both the wc and sc simulations these mesoscale anomalies are generated by a combination of oceanic processes such as instability of the mean flow and its interactions with topography and atmospheric variability such as wind and heat flux anomalies as is discussed in the preceding section our wc and sc simulations exhibit very different ocean stratification sst and near surface currents the large scale atmospheric conditions are also different between the two cases the mesoscale ssta induce a noticeable atmospheric response and the resulting ocean atmosphere coupling depends on the amplitude and spatial scale of ssta as well as on the ambient atmospheric and oceanic conditions in this section we will study these dependencies focusing on general characteristics of ocean atmosphere interactions on the ocean mesoscale rather than on domain specific features 3 2 1 isolating mesoscale features the spatio temporal anomalies analyzed in this section are defined over a time interval long enough to represent interactions between synoptic atmospheric events and mesoscale oceanic anomalies a typical time scale of a synoptic atmospheric forcing is 2 5 days eskridge et al 1997 while earlier studies suggested using minimum of 10 days or more of averaging to quantify the effects of atmospheric wind response to the sst anomalies o neill 2012 we found that using a 5 day running averaging led to sufficiently robust results we first computed daily average values of the analyzed quantities to eliminate the diurnal cycle and then applied the running 5 day average to define spatial anomalies we used a 2 d loess smoother that was based on locally weighted quadratic regression schlax and chelton 1992 chelton and schlax 2003 the filter properties yield half power cutoff at corresponding values of its half span half size window high pass perturbations or anomalies used interchangeably were computed as local departures from the low pass filtered values two different filter windows were chosen to study the dependence of the atmosphere ocean coupling on a spatial scale the first filter has a half span of 10 5 in the longitudinal and latitudinal directions respectively this filter is labeled further in the text and figures as f1 and is similar to the filter used in other studies e g chelton et al 2004 putrasahan et al 2013a b seo et al 2016 the second filter f2 uses half span of 150 km 150 km and is intended to isolate features associated with the oceanic small scale mesoscale variability fig 7 shows the meridionally and time averaged zonal wavenumber spectra for the full fields and their f1 and f2 anomalies which allows us to examine the scale dependence in these fields and assess the performance of the filtering all spectra of the full fields are basically red with flattening at the long zonal scales of 400 1000 km spectral densities of the full sst and heat flux for the wc case are smaller than for the sc case at the wavenumbers greater the 0 09 0 1 cycles degree longitude 800 1000 km illustrating stronger spatial anomalies in the sc case regional differences between the wc and sc cases are even larger as confirmed by calculating the same spectra in the northern parts of the domain not shown in contrast the wind stress spectra are very close to each other in the wc and sc simulations despite ssta being stronger in the latter case these results are partially explained by the strong explicit dependence of the surface heat fluxes on dt and ssta whereas the coupling between winds and ssta is less pronounced application of the f1 and f2 filters limits spectral power at the length scales greater than the filter half width corresponding to about 785 km and 150 km for the f1 and f2 filters respectively for the f1 filter the peak in spectral power appears around 460 km while the power is reduced at longer wavelengths for the f2 filter the spectral power cut off occurs at the expected length scales of greater than 150 km note that the f1 filter whose full size window is comparable to the entire domain illuminates the peak around 400 500 km lengths a signal that could be noticed but is more obscured in the full spectra fields interestingly enough a well distinguished spectral peaks at 300 km wavelengths were found in the filtered oi sst data and modeled wind speeds in the region similar to our sc case except in a larger domain and with a larger filter size perlin et al 2014 analysis of different sst databases in another study song et al 2009 also indicated spectral peaks at the length scales of 300 500 km in the region of the agulhas return current this agreement between our results and other studies is encouraging according to the vmm local ssta should manifest themselves in wind stress anomalies a single day data that includes 5 day running averages of these fields in figs 8 9 serve as examples of the spatial structure of these anomalies and the relationship between them the wind stress anomalies and the ssta for the f1 filter fig 8a b are generally well defined with the most pronounced anomalies being co located the spatial scale of these perturbations varies between 1 and 5 degrees in latitude longitude the sc case has the largest sst and wind stress anomalies in the northern part of the domain around the areas with strong spatial variability in these time mean variables see section 3 1 the f2 filter fig 8c d yields weaker spatial features of notably smaller length scales and of elongated shapes the spatial correlation between the f2 wind stress anomalies and sstas is less pronounced than for the f1 anomalies many wind stress anomalies in the wc case do not have a clear correspondence to sstas although strong sstas in the northern part of the sc domain almost always correspond to wind stress perturbations as a result the spatial correlations between the single day fields in fig 8 yield 0 48 0 35 for the f1 f2 anomalies in wc case and 0 60 0 51 for the f1 f2 anomalies in the sc case lack of clear spatial alignment between the sstas and wind f2 anomalies in the wc domain and southern part of the sc domain could be explained by two reasons first small scale ssta are weak because the sst spectrum is red and the atmospheric response may not be well pronounced in the wc case this explanation is consistent with the fact that the wind sst correlation is rather strong in the northern half of the sc domain the atmosphere may also not be able to fully adjust to sstas on short spatial scales partly because of the horizontal advection by large scale winds and the finite time required for the vvm for example kilpatrick et al 2016 explored the mabl response in an idealized case of mid latitude sst front and along frontal winds and concluded on the importance of the advection in the mabl dynamics the time scale of the mabl response to ssta of o 10 min mahrt et al 2001 would lead to the down wind displacement of o 5 10 km in our case the displacement would have a more noticeable effect on the spatial correlations of the f2 anomalies than the f1 anomalies although we did not attempt to quantify this effect in our study as expected ssta and turbulent heat flux anomalies are co located for both the f1 and f2 filters and in the wc and sc simulations fig 9 heat fluxes also strongly depend on dt anomalies turbulent heat flux here is defined as a sum of the latent and sensible heat fluxes both flux components show similar spatial structure this colocation indicates a local relationship between ssta dt and air sea exchange of heat and is particularly clear in the northern part of the sc domain unlike the relationship between sstas and wind stress the ssta heat flux relationship is well pronounced even for weak f2 anomalies in the wc case 3 2 2 the sst induced atmospheric response and coupling coefficients a common way to quantify the strength of air sea coupling is through computing the coupling coefficients between various pairs of atmospheric and oceanic variables these coupling coefficients represent a measure of the sensitivity of mesoscale atmospheric adjustment to the ssta and are conventionally used to illustrate the vmm mechanism stronger weaker winds over warm cold ssta there are several important diagnostics for mesoscale air sea interaction such as coupling coefficients describing the sensitivity of the near surface atmospheric flow and other properties to the mesoscale ssta chelton et al 2001 chelton and xie 2010 o neill et al 2010 2012 in the current study we consider the coupling coefficients for wind stress and ssta equivalent neutral stability ens winds and ssta and turbulent fluxes and ssta two additional important types of coupling coefficients are also calculated and discussed in the supplemental information for the wind stress divergence and downwind sst gradient and for the wind stress curl and cross wind sst gradient o neill 2012 argued that the ens wind sst coupling coefficients provide more stable and reliable quantification of the wind sst coupling than those derived from the wind stress sst relationship turbulent heat flux and ssta coupling coefficients putrasahan et al 2013a can also illustrate the mechanism of the coupling positive correlation between the heat flux out of the ocean and ssta corresponds to atmospheric damping of ssta whereas the negative correlation suggests atmospheric driving the sst variability stronger winds also lead to larger air sea heat exchange and in the case of the atmosphere causing sst variability wind speed anomalies can be expected to be negatively correlated with ssta wind stress components are obtained from the model friction velocity u and 10 m wind directional components the ens wind is defined as 10 m wind with stability effects neglected and is then estimated as following 1 w 10 m n u k l n 10 z 0 where u is friction velocity k is von kármán constant and z 0 is the sea surface roughness length the variables u and z 0 come from the model surface flux parameterization scheme z 0 also includes charnock relation that accounts for high winds fairall et al 1996 the coupling coefficients were calculated using a binned linear regression of wind wind stress perturbations on the sstas the same method was used for other pairs of variables discussed in the supplementary information section the pairs of perturbations from the two dimensional 5 day averages as in fig 8 for the entire 2 year simulation were used note that using this binned method the magnitude of the coupling coefficient is not a reliable indication of how well the anomalies in two fields are co located and we analyze local correlations in time for that purpose only bins with population over 1000 are used to compute the binned regression values the bulk method for estimating the coupling coefficients is also used in order to understand factors that determine the strength of the coupling because a coupling coefficient is a linear regression coefficient it is related to the correlation coefficient between for example ssta and ens 10 m wind speed anomalies ρ u t storch and zwiers 1999 perlin et al 2014 2 s u ρ u t σ u σ t where σ u and σ t are the standard deviations of the ens 10 m wind speed anomalies and ssta respectively temporal correlations are further computed between the wind stress and ssta to address the familywise error rate we applied the false discovery rate fdr method and used the threshold probability for the fdr p f d r to define statistically significant correlation coefficients benjamini and hochberg 1995 wilks 2016 the fdr procedure requires a higher standard of smaller p values for testing multiple null hypotheses multiple locations that it would be for a single null hypothesis single location the null hypothesis in this case is the absence of significant correlation at a given probability α the fdr algorithm operates on the collection of p values from n local hypotheses tests and a chosen α f d r a local single hypothesis threshold value we used α f d r 0 05 initially the p values are estimated from individual null hypothesis tests and then subsequently sorted in the ascending order in such a way that p 1 p 2 p n for i 1 n this procedure results in a distribution of p values for a given number of n hypothesis tests furthermore additional quantity of i n α f d r is estimated for each sorted i index and then compared with the initially estimated p i values we let k be the largest i index for which p i i n α f d r the null hypotheses are then rejected for all the locations corresponding indices i 1 2 k a threshold is therefore determined as p f d r max i 1 n p i p i i n α f d r benjamini and hochberg 1995 cf eq 1 wilks 2016 cf eq 3 the correlations between the high passed wind stresses and ssta fig 10 colors are predominantly positive for the f1 filtered fields and persistently stronger for the sc case than for the wc case they average to 0 36 0 42 for the wc sc domain with nearly identical p f d r of 0 0497 0 0496 for small mesoscale f2 filtered anomalies fig 10 bottom row the correlation coefficients are reduced to 0 22 0 32 for the wc sc and p f d r 0 0435 0 0462 some parts of the domain show insignificant or even weakly negative correlations for f2 filtered fields with the exception of the northern part of the sc domain which is characterized by prominent mesoscale features and exhibits correlations range between 0 4 and 0 8 to demonstrate the differential ocean atmospherecoupling on the large scales and mesoscale we also computed the correlations between the full unfiltered fields of the wind stress and sst fig 10 contours the annual cycle was removed from the full fields prior to computing the correlations and the similar fdr approach has been applied note that the full fields are dominated by large scale features fig 7 and the corresponding wind sst relationships are primarily influenced by the air sea coupling on long spatial scales consistent with the expected atmospheric forcing driving the ocean response the full fields yield weak negative correlations over most of the locations averaged to 0 17 0 19 for the wc sc case with the p f d r 0 0409 0 0448 except for the few limited regions over the strong mesoscale features in the northern part of the sc domain where the values are weakly positive 0 2 in a similar way to the wind stress sstcorrelations the correlations were computed between the turbulent heat flux perturbations and ssta as well as between the corresponding full fields fig 11 correlations for the perturbations are high and positive for the mesoscale features 0 82 0 82 for the wc sc domain using the f1 filter and 0 69 0 78 for the f2 filter and p f d r 0 05 for all the correlations for the full fields are in contrast extremely small yielding 0 06 0 06 with p f d r 0 0147 0 0133 for the wc sc case the sc domain shows weakly positive correlations in the northern part similar to the wind sst coupling the lack of consistent positive temporal correlations suggests that the atmosphere drives the sst variability at long spatial scales the wind coupling coefficients were estimated next using the binned linear regression method for the ens wind and wind stress perturbations and ssta s u and s str fig 12 as in the case of the correlation coefficients the use of high pass filters with different spatial windows f1 and f2 allowed a limited scale dependency analysis large mesoscale anomalies filter f1 in all variables have wider range of values and higher variance within each bin than the small mesoscale anomalies this is true for both the wc and sc cases and all types of the coupling coefficients and is explained by lower magnitudes of small mesoscale ssta the s u and s str coefficients for all the domains are listed in table 1 coupling coefficients for wind stress divergence downwind sst gradient s dstr and wind stress curl cross wind sst gradient s cstr are also estimated using a similar approach and are shown in the supplemental information fig si 5 table si 1 also lists these additional coupling coefficients along with the domain average standard deviations for the corresponding variable pairs similar to table 1 the coupling coefficients are consistently higher for the wc case for all fields in table 1 in the inner atmospheric domain fully coupled regime this may seem surprising since the same variable pairs show higher correlations in the sc case table 1 and fig 10 to understand the causes of this contradiction we estimated the terms in the bulk formula eq 2 note that unlike the binned approach that excludes higher perturbation ssta outliers and less populated bins the bulk method estimates the correlations and standard deviations from all data values and may result in slight differences in coupling coefficient estimates which are discussed further as can be seen in table 1 the standard deviation of ssta is typically 2 3 times greater in the sc case than in the wc case whereas the standard deviations of the wind variables are less variant between the two simulations as a consequence the coupling coefficient is larger in the wc case despite the weaker correlation we further inspected the wind response over the sc domain by splitting it in two subdomains north and south of 44 s supplemental information table si 2 the results confirmed that higher temporal correlations are associated with larger σ sst and smaller coupling coefficients this effect is observed for all of the perturbation pairs except for the f2 filtered sst wind stress to evaluate the robustness of the conclusions table 1 also shows the coupling coefficients computed for the part of the outer atmospheric grid that covers the oceanic domain where the atmospheric model is forced by the observed sst oi sst and the atmospheric resolution is coarser than in the inner domain another important difference between the domains is that while the atmosphere ocean coupling is two way in the inner domain the ocean feedbacks are absent in the outer domain in agreement with the results in the inner domain two way coupling the correlations between the sst and wind variables in the outer domain one way coupling are consistently stronger in the sc case table 1 and table si 1 right half the difference between coupling coefficients between the wc and sc regions is however noticeably reduced in the outer domain one way coupling compare to the inner domain while s u continues to be higher in the wc case all other types of coupling coefficients show little differences between the wc and sc cases to further evaluate confidence intervals for different coupling coefficients the supplemental information table si 3 presents the statistics for all of the above estimations according to these estimates our main conclusion that s u is higher in the wc case than in the sc case is statistically robust for all the filters and inner outer domains in contrast the difference in s str between the wc and sc domains is statistically significant in the inner domain only with no similar conclusions made for the outer domain although the sst standard deviations σ t in eq 2 are very high in the outer sc domain the wind stress variance and the wind stress sst correlations are also higher leading to the similarity in s str between the outer wc and sc domain as discussed earlier correlations between the small mesoscale f2 filtered sst and wind anomalies are noticeably lower than between their large mesoscale f1 filtered counterparts the values of coupling coefficients differ for f1 and f2 but to a lesser extent as in the case of the wc and sc coupling coefficients eq 2 is used to study the terms defining the coupling coefficients both σ sst and σ w are noticeably smaller in the case of the f2 filtered anomalies than for the f1 filtered fields the difference between the scales is more pronounced for the ssta as could be confirmed from the wavenumber spectra fig 7 a b as a result the ratios of standard deviations in eq 2 are greater for the small mesoscale anomalies than for the large mesoscale ones f1 the product of the correlation coefficient lower for f2 and the standard deviation ratio higher for f2 thus explains similar coupling coefficients in both cases the coupling coefficient between turbulent heat fluxes and ssta s hfx shows little difference for both cases and both the small and large mesoscale anomalies fig 13 the difference between the two cases is much smaller than for the wind sst coupling this is consistent with the strong explicit dependence of the heat fluxes on dt and thus a more direct local turbulent heat flux response to the underlying sstas as opposed to the wind response which is governed by vmm and pam comparison to earlier estimates of the coupling coefficients could be more readily done for the sc case and the outer domain because of the use of observational oi sst data our analysis of the f1 filtered data produced s u 0 44 and s str 0 020 which are in a good agreement with the o neill et al 2012 values of 0 44 and 0 022 respectively calculated for the agulhas region from multi year quikscat scatterometer observations the perlin et al 2014 modeling study for a single month wintertime period over the agulhas regions reported s u 0 42 s str 0 022 and s u 0 38 s str 0 017 derived from the quikscat noaa oi sst data and from the uncoupled coamps simulations respectively the agreement confirms that the modeled response of the atmosphere to ssta in our study is realistic 3 2 3 variability in the coupling coefficients the previous section demonstrates that the s u and s str coupling coefficients are sensitive to the length scale of the spatial anomalies filter f1 vs filter f2 and differ between two geographical domains wc and sc in the fully coupled regime in this section we further examine the variability in the coupling coefficients in time and their sensitivity to the background conditions despite significant month to month variability in the wind sst coupling coefficients they show either a very weak or no annual cycle see the discussion in the supplemental information fig si 6 importantly all coupling coefficients maintain their sign throughout the year indicating that the ocean is forcing the atmosphere year around overall our results agree well with the findings reported in previous studies o neill et al 2012 putrasahan et al 2013a the coupling coefficients wind anomalies ssta and ssta gradients have been shown to vary with the wind speed byrne et al 2015 foussard et al 2019 to get a further insight into variability in the coupling coefficients we investigated their dependence on large scale winds in the wc and sc domains we first described the 10 m ens wind speeds and their variability using the weibull distribution which is considered to be a reasonably good fit to wind data takle and brown 1978 seguro and lambert 2000 fig 14a for this analysis we used the model data in both the wc and sc regions and both the outer one way coupling portion overlapping the roms domain and inner full coupling domains to determine the weibull fit parameters namely we estimated the amplitude a which can be viewed as a median value and the shape parameter k which can serve as a measure of variability see fig 14a the amplitudes of a are about 1 m s 1 greater for the sc region than for the wc region yielding 11 5 11 1 m s 1 and 10 6 10 3 m s 1 for the outer inner sc and wc domains respectively the sc domain exhibits greater variability as described by the shape parameter k the weibull fit for the cumulative probability distribution cdf can further help to identify the wind ranges of the most probable and extreme high low wind speeds for example weak wind speeds 4 m s appear to have the 3 5 of the cdf and the upper 4 5 i e above 95 96 cdf is populated by winds exceeding 15 m s 1 the range between 4 and 15 m s 1 is thus found in nearly 90 of the occurrences using the above results we estimated coupling coefficients for the three ens wind speed ranges weak winds 4 m s 1 mid range winds of 4 15 m s 1 and strong winds 15 m s 1 fig 14b the mid range of wind speeds consistently show the largest coupling coefficients compared to the extreme weak strong wind speed ranges for each individual domain or filter used the largest coupling coefficients for winds 4 m s 1 resulted for the f1 filter we next explore the dependence of s u and the terms in the bulk formula eq 2 on the ens wind speed fig 15 for this purpose we binned the background ens wind speeds and recalculated the coupling coefficients between the wind speed anomalies and sst s u and wind stress anomalies and ssta s str for the data points corresponding to each interval the s u coefficient for the f1 filtered values has a larger range in the wc case 0 38 0 54 than in the sc case 0 36 0 44 the s u coefficients from the f2 filtered data are more skewed decreasing for wind speeds stronger than 6 8 m s 1 this result could be explained by higher winds usually being associated with larger scale synoptic systems and are severely reduced by the f2 filter the s u coefficients for the weakest 3 m s 1 and strongest 19 22 m s 1 wind speeds are very similar for the sc and wc regions the correlation coefficients appear to have a dominant role in driving the s u dependence on the ens wind speeds than the other terms such as σ sst or σ w according to eq 2 and fig 15 c d the s str coupling coefficient exhibits a markedly different behavior from s u in most cases s str shows close to linear dependence on the ens wind speed increasing nearly two fold from the weakest to the stronger winds of 16 21 m s 1 the only exception is the f1 filtered wc data where s str decreases for the winds 16 m s 1 unlike the coupling coefficients the correlation coefficient between the wind stress and ssta fig 15e b dashed lines is very similar to the correlation coefficient between the ens wind speed and sst however a combination of the consistent increase in σ w and a slight decrease in σ sst with the ens wind speed yields a linear response of the s str these markedly different dependencies in s u and s str on the wind speed suggest a more complex relationship between the mesoscale wind stress anomalies and sstas it is possible that it is due to a negative feedback of the wind anomalies on sstas with stronger winds causing sst cooling 3 2 4 pressure adjustment mechanism vs vertical mixing mechanism our earlier analysis involving perturbations of winds momentum or turbulent fluxes addressed a local atmospheric response to the sstas on the basis of the vmm see section 1 we then examined whether another atmospheric response mechanism pam could take an active role in the atmospheric adjustment to the sstas as a basis of this pam mechanism the simple mabl model minobe et al 2008 predicts a correspondence between the wind convergence and the laplacian of the sea level pressure slp as a consequence this hydrostatic sea level pressure response leads to surface winds convergence given sufficient time and spatial scales to reach the equilibrium an example of the surface hydrostatic pressure anomalies and the ssta in fig 16 a d and other individual snapshots not shown indicate that occasional correspondence could be observed at times but the correlations are small and insignificant for large portions of the domain the domain average is 0 114 0 117 for the wc sc domain i e rather negligible for the scales analyzed here fig 16e f not shown for the f2 filtered data to further explore the presence of the pam we examine the correspondence between three variables the laplacian of slp the laplacian of the sst ssta and the surface wind convergence the temporal correlations between the surface wind convergence and the laplacian of the slp are predominantly positive fig 17a b with domain average of 0 48 0 40 and p f d r 0 0500 0 0497 for the wc sc case the correlations between the surface wind convergence and laplacian of sst with the negative sign are either insignificant or range between 0 2 and 0 2 and averaging to 0 06 0 09 and p f d r 0 0164 0 0174 for the wc sc domains fig 17c d somewhat similar values and ranges result for the laplacian of slp and the laplacian of the sst with the negative sign fig 17e f which average to 0 07 0 08 with p f d r 0 013 0 015 for the wc sc domain furthermore when these fields were not smoothed with the 5 day running average significant correlations were not found the statistics of the similar correlation coefficients for both domains and f1 f2 filters are shown in table 2 indicating that qualitatively the results are very similar for the wc and sc and for both f1 and f2 filters because the correspondence between pressure anomalies and wind anomalies could come from different processes and they are not correlated well with the ssta the pam mechanism therefore could not be confirmed for the spatial and temporal scales considered in this study note that earlier studies of the pam were focused on the frontal zones such as the kuroshio current putrasahan et al 2013a and longer time scales some recent studies of parfitt et al 2017 and parfitt and seo 2018 argued that the correspondence between these variables likely results from the accumulation of processes driven by mechanisms acting on synoptic scale rather than on a time mean scale 4 discussion and conclusions this study presents a regional midlatitude high resolution atmosphere ocean coupled model of intermediate complexity with a realistic atmospheric component and a semi idealized oceanic model of zonal flow this fully coupled model is designed for studies of the atmosphere ocean interactions at the scales from tens to several hundreds of kilometers and is flexible with respect to choosing atmospheric and oceanic conditions the atmospheric model consists of two nested domains the inner domain fully coupled with the ocean model and the outer domain one way coupled with the observed sst our analysis focuses on two simulations one in which the oceanic isopycnals are steep and ocean currents are strong strong currents or sc and another with less steep isopycnals and weaker currents weak currents or wc the wc domain has weaker atmospheric winds and variability than the sc domain simulated mesoscale variability in the ocean includes meandering eastward currents as well as transient anomalies generated due to a combination of intrinsic instability of the oceanic flow and synoptic atmospheric forcing these anomalies occur on a wide range of spatial scales and we distinguish large mesoscale several hundreds of kilometers and small mesoscale tens of kilometers anomalies the atmosphere ocean coupling over these large mesoscale and small mesoscale anomalies is the main topic of this study our analysis quantifies the strength of the coupling between the wind wind stress and sst we concluded that this coupling is governed by the vertical mixing mechanism vmm which implies acceleration of winds over warm ssta in agreement with the vmm large mesoscale ssta and their gradients are well correlated with the ens 10 m surface winds as well as with the wind stress and its curl divergence at the statistically significant level in contrast to this high spatial coherency the temporal correlations were smaller for the small mesoscale anomalies and nearly zero for the large scale unfiltered fields for the small mesoscale features the lack of correlation is most likely explained by the apparent inability of the atmosphere to adjust to features on short spatial and temporal scales and overall weakness of small scale ssta turbulent heat flux anomalies are notably better correlated with the ssta than are the wind and wind stress which is not surprising given strong dependence of these heat fluxes on the atmosphere ocean temperature difference in agreement with previous studies strong positive correlation between the heat flux anomalies and ssta indicates that the ocean is driving the thermal coupling at the mesoscale whereas the correlation is weak or negative at large scales the atmosphere ocean coupling is further quantified in terms of coupling coefficients calculated using a binned linear regression of the wind perturbations on ssta interestingly the fully coupled wc domain yields consistently stronger coupling coefficients than the sc domain for the ens 10 m winds ssta s u and for the wind stress ssta s str despite having lower correlations between the same pairs of variables this occurs due to the ratio of the wind perturbation variances to ssta variances being larger in the wc case and implies that similar sstas are expected to generate a stronger wind response in the wc domain furthermore small mesoscale fields produce consistently lower coupling coefficients a result statistically significant across all the coupling statistics and different methods of their estimation and in all domains finally oceanic feedbacks on sst generated atmospheric anomalies can be estimated by our comparison between one way and two way coupled model domains for example the difference in the coupling coefficients between the wc and sc regions is reduced in the outer model domain where no oceanic feedbacks are allowed this result however can also be partially due to a coarser model resolution in this region significant variability in the coupling coefficients indicates a complex nonlinear relationship between the wind and sst anomalies which can manifest itself in the dependence of the coupling coefficients on sst and winds the lack of a clear annual cycle suggests that the temporal variability in the wind sst coupling coefficients was not due to the large scale sst which has a clear annual cycle further analysis of s u and s str dependence on the ens 10 m wind speeds shows that for the mid range of wind speeds the s u shows less variability across the range whereas we find substantial nearly linear dependence of the s str coupling coefficient on the wind speed this difference is consistent with the wind stress being a quadratic function of the wind speed for very weak and very strong winds the dependence is less definite which may have several explanations for the weakest winds weaker coupling could be explained by a decreased mixing and increased static stability that dampens the atmospheric response regardless of the underlying conditions and geographic location for the strong winds and corresponding highly turbulent conditions in a deeper mabl the horizontal advection term or surface cooling may start to play an increasingly larger role in turbulent flux exchange thus decreasing the dependence on local sst anomalies from the ocean perspective transfer of higher momentum into the oceanic mixed layer could also enhance the horizontal advection on mesoscales or mixed layer deepening which may act to reduce the local sst anomalies note that a more detailed exploration of the sensitivity of the coupling coefficients to a full range of environmental parameters is beyond the scope of the current study among other studies that explored the scale dependence of the ocean atmosphere interaction laurindo et al 2018 presented spatio temporal scale analysis of the correlations between the sst and wind speeds their study explored the transition from negative correlations at large scales to positive correlations at the oceanic mesoscale and found the transition scale to coinside with the atmospheric first baroclinic rossby radius of deformation for the scales analyzed in our study we found a reduction of temporal correlations from overwhelmingly positive for the large mesoscale perturbations to weak positive at the small scale mesoscales our analysis could not demonstrate the importance of the pressure adjustment mechanism pam it is possible that this finding is specific for our study as the pam mechanism has been shown to be important in strong frontal zones e g putrasahan et al 2013a where it results from the accumulation of processes of synoptic scales parfitt et al 2017 parfitt and seo 2018 a study by oerder et al 2016 focused on mesoscale sst wind stress coupling in the peru chile current system concluded that wind stress anomalies are primarily forced by sstas their momentum balance found negligible contribution of the near surface pressure anomalies as compared to the turbulent momentum mixing vmm into the surface wind acceleration small contribution of the surface pressure anomalies was attributed to the back pressure effect related to the air temperature inversion a more idealized numerical study by kilpatrick et al 2014 that focused on boundary layer effects under the condition of strong winds crossing the mid latitude sst front also concluded that the mabl response directly above the front is dominated by the physics consistent with the vmms in conclusion this model is a convenient tool for studies of the atmosphere ocean coupling at the scales from tens to hundreds of kilometers relatively high resolution of 2 5 km in the ocean allows adequate resolution of the oceanic rossby deformation radius whereas the atmospheric resolution of 9 km permits using explicitly resolved moist physics for convective processes associated with the synoptic and associated mesoscale forcing further analysis of these numerical simulations is underway to study the ocean mixed layer heat budget and heat transport by the mesoscale ocean currents in the mixed layer credit authorship contribution statement

23956,we present a numerical study of current effects on waves cew at submesoscales 100 s of m 10 s of km with a realistic model configuration in southern california cew is analyzed by comparing solutions forced by winds with and without current forcing through relative differences the modulation of wave field due to currents is larger for the wave breaking variables i e whitecap coverage air entrainment and energy dissipation followed by the resolved mean square slope surface stokes drift and the significant wave height background currents on average increase the directional spreading by 0 9 and modulate the mean wave direction within 5 cew decreases with increasing wind speed because the rms current gradients also decrease while the wind forcing and breaking restore the wave field towards equilibrium faster at higher winds empirical scalings based on the mean wave period rms current gradients and friction velocity are found to explain 80 or more of the variability for the model differences due to cew except for the significant wave height explaining 66 of the variability the statistics of model differences due to cew are approximately gaussian for the significant wave height symmetric with finite excess kurtosis for the higher spectral moments and positively skewed with excess kurtosis for the wave breaking variables keywords wave current interactions current effects on waves air sea fluxes wave breaking 1 introduction wave current interactions can be divided into current effects on waves cew and wave effects on currents wec this study is concerned with the former in particular the modulation of the wave field at submesoscales o 1 km or smaller in recent years cew has gained interest in the literature due to its relevance for remote sensing the modulation of wave breaking and related air sea fluxes and the incidence of extreme waves janssen and herbers 2009 hjelmervik and trulsen 2009 onorato et al 2011 moreover cew allows for the investigation of the wave spectrum modulation from wind wave equilibrium phillips 1984 kudryavtsev et al 2017 reported a novel characterization of the wave spectral variability due to currents inverting spectra from satellite sun glitter imagery with supporting altimeter data ardhuin et al 2017 used satellite altimetry and realistic models to show that the modulation of the wave field by currents at scales from 10 s to 100 s of kilometers is significant with the significant wave height varying by more than 50 at scales of 10 s of km quilfen et al 2018 presented an analysis of the wave field across the agulhas current with satellite altimeter and synthetic aperture radar sar finding consistent patterns with a wave model forced with surface currents from altimeter but the impacts due to currents were under predicted the global analysis of satellite altimetry data by quilfen and chapron 2019 showed a clear relation between the dominant mode of spatial variability of the wave field and that of the sea surface topography indicating a strong coupling of the wave field to ocean currents at mesoscales supporting the findings of kudryavtsev et al 2017 and ardhuin et al 2017 romero et al 2017 reported airborne field observations of the wave field modulation by currents at the edge of an upwelling jet in northern california and the loop current in the gulf of mexico the results showed significant variability of the wave field particularly for the wave breaking statistics with the significant slope varying by 15 the directional spreading by 4 and the whitecap coverage by 50 or larger the whitecap coverage correlated well with the spectral saturation and inversely with the directional spreading their measurements showed enhanced wave breaking along a submesoscale front at the edge of the upwelling jet and a reduction of the winds at 30 m above mean sea level which is consistent with an increase of the drag along the front due to enhanced wave breaking rascle et al 2014 2016 developed techniques for the retrieval of surface current gradient information based on remote sensing measurements of ocean surface roughness which were further validated with airborne remote observations against in situ measurements collected with surface drifters rascle et al 2017 in this study cew is investigated numerically with the model wavewatch iii ww3 forced by the regional ocean modeling system roms and the weather research and forecasting model wrf with a realistic model configuration at very high resolutions o 100 m in southern california wave models in southern california have commonly focused on the swell band without external forcing by winds or currents o reilly and guza 1993 1998 o reilly et al 2016 crosby et al 2016 the lack of wind forcing has resulted in significant errors in sheltered areas particularly in the santa barbara channel the work by rogers et al 2007 with the model simulating waves nearshore swan forced with global operational winds and wave boundary conditions from operational wavewatch iii ww3 concluded that both boundary conditions and atmospheric forcing are critical for the model performance within the bight the recent study by cao et al 2018 with swan forced with wrf and boundary conditions from global reanalysis by european centre medium range weather forecasts era interim found qualitative agreement against buoy observations for a 10 year period they also suggest that currents can significantly affect the wave field within the bight this study expands on previous studies by investigating cew including wave breaking at very high model resolutions with a realistic model configuration the manuscript is organized as follows in section 2 we described the model physics and configuration the results are presented in section 3 followed by a discussion and conclusions in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 methods the wave model wavewatch iii the wavewatch iii development group ww3dg 2016 was implemented in southern california the spectral

related to wind wave generation the wind input s i n is modeled according to ardhuin et al 2010 based on the quasilinear theory by janssen 1989 1991 including sheltering at short waves due to longer waves and swell dissipation the nonlinear energy fluxes s n l are computed with the discrete interaction approximation dia hasselmann and hasselmann 1985 and the energy dissipation due to deep water wave breaking s d s is modeled according to romero 2019 within the framework of phillips λ distribution phillips 1985 which was validated against the field measurements by sutherland and melville 2013 the wave breaking model s d s is summarized below for completeness the bottom friction is computed with a parameterization for a movable sandy bed by ardhuin et al 2003 switch option bt4 of ww3 the

the function m l k accounts for the breaking modulation by the longer waves and m w k is a breaking amplification for the short waves to balance the wind input the wave breaking modulation due to

length of breaking crests per unit surface area l is given by 16 l λ k d k and higher moments of λ k are related to different physical parameters assuming that the phase speed of waves is proportional to the speed of the breaking fronts 1 1 see discussion in romero 2019 the probability of breaking at a point corresponds to p b λ k c d k following kleiss and melville 2010 the whitecap coverage is modeled according to 17 w 2 π g γ c 2 λ k d k where γ is a dimensionless factor representing the duration of breaking relative to the wave period 2 π c g the factor of γ here is 30 larger than that of

largest l0 domain with a resolution of 4 km covers the entire u s west coast as described by renault et al 2016 the model is hydrostatic and does not assimilate observations instead the l0 boundary

features in a statistical sense as opposed to deterministic e g buijsman et al 2012 romero et al 2013 uchiyama et al 2014 romero et al 2016 the solutions also include hydrostatic internal tides which are only evident in certain regions as they become incoherent from their interaction with mesoscale and submesoscale processes van haren 2004 ponte and klein 2015 kumar et al 2019 two periods were selected for this study the month of december 2006 and the period between march 15 through april 15 in 2007 the periods were chosen because of the relatively active wave climate with the significant wave height h s reaching 8 5 m in the winter and 5 5 m in the spring in exposed areas wave boundary conditions were generated using buoy observations at the harvest buoy from the coastal data information program cdip other buoys with supporting wind and wave observations within the domain were used for model validation a total of 7 cdip buoys collected wave measurements during the periods of interest which are in order from the north diablo canyon harvest goleta rincon anacapa santa monica and san pedro canyon see locations in fig 1b five buoys from the national data buoy center ndbc collected wind and wave observations 46011 46054 46053 46025 46069 see fig 1b with the exception of 46011 which did not operate during the winter the deep water buoys exposed to open ocean swell are the harvest buoy 46011 in the santa maria basin and 46069 south of santa rosa island following o reilly et al 2016 the harvest buoy data was used to generate boundary conditions accounting for the appropriate time lag determined by the distance between a given boundary point and the buoy divided by the deep water group speed this was done at all frequencies and directions projected along the shortest path to the buoy location prior to calculating the boundary conditions the buoy observations i e frequency spectra and directional fourier coefficients at half hour intervals were temporally smoothed using a running filter 11 point hann window with an effective decorrelation timescale of 2 5 h there are many ways to calculate the directional distribution from buoy measurements all of which are method dependent benoit 1992 the two most widely used methods to estimate wave directional distribution are the maximum likelihood method capon 1969 and the maximum entropy method lygre and krogstad 1986 we used the maximum entropy method which gives narrower spectra and is the preferred method used by cdip due to the narrowness of the swell band since the predominant waves during spring and winter in southern california are from the nw w boundary conditions generated only using the harvest buoy are sufficient for other seasons with significant wave energy coming from the south other buoys can be combined to provide adequate boundary conditions e g o reilly et al 2016 the spectral grid used consists of 24 directions δ θ 1 5 and 22 frequencies between 0 037 and 0 7 hz with logarithmic increment δ f f 0 15 the choice to use a relatively coarse grid as opposed to the standard grid with δ f f 0 1 was to reduce the computational cost preliminary tests showed that our results were not sensitive to using a coarser grid the propagation scheme used is the third order ultimate quickest with spatial averaging tolman 2002 several runs were carried out for comparison including control runs with depth induced refraction only without external forcing ctl runs forced by wind wnd and runs forced by both wind and currents cew surface currents from roms were used to force the model using the vertical grid point closest to the surface this choice was made for simplicity but it would be more appropriate to use scale and depth dependent current velocities stewart and joy 1974 at the expense of increasing the number of input parameters into ww3 the model runs are summarized and labeled in table 1 the l2 l3 global and source term time steps were set to 40 s 12 s with spatial and intra spectral propagation time steps of 8 s 4 s and 20 s 6 s respectively model output was saved at hourly intervals which is composed of directional wave spectra at the buoy

observations time series of the significant wave height h s for the l2 configurations at harvest goleta and san pedro canyon are compared against the buoy data in fig 2 the comparison at harvest buoy is in excellent agreement serving as a check for the boundary conditions the model solutions within the southern california bight at goleta and san pedro buoys without wind forcing significantly underestimate h s with larger errors in the spring the solutions forced by wind wnd show significant improvement with good agreement with the observations particularly during large wave events but with appreciable errors at higher temporal variability diurnal the high frequency variability of the h s solutions forced by wind shows good correspondence with the local wind variability from wrf shown on the top of each panel the model solution forced by both winds and currents cew generally tracks the solution only forced by wind wnd however occasionally the cew solution shows significant deviations at the goleta buoy within the santa barbara channel during periods of relatively low winds 10 m s see for example 12 13 and 12 17 in fig 2b and 3 24 and 3 27 in fig 2e direct comparisons of omnidirectional and directional frequency spectra during the largest storm on dec 28 00 00 utc and a period of low wind dominated by swell on 12 18 6 00 utc at harvest goleta and san pedro buoys are shown in figs 3a c and 3d f respectively as expected the control run underestimates the energy particularly at high frequencies with smaller errors during low winds the wind forced spectra are in good agreement with the buoy observations at all three buoys during the storm the observations and model approximately match the saturation spectrum g 2 2 π 2 b f 5 by romero and melville 2010a at frequencies larger than 0 2 hz at lower wavenumbers and lower wind speeds the spectral tail is better represented by the f 4 equilibrium range model by resio et al 2004 the corresponding directional spectra forced by wind wnd compare qualitatively well against the buoy measurements for the two periods shown however as shown in fig 2 the model errors can be significant at times partly due to wind forcing errors as can be seen in the high frequency fluctuation in fig 2e f correlated to wind fluctuations the cew solutions are also shown generally tracking the wnd solutions with larger differences near the spectral peak at the goleta buoy in low winds fig 3e the overall model performance is further quantified at each buoy for the two periods in table 2 given a variable x the normalized root mean square error is defined as 19 nrmse x x m o d x o b s 2 x o b s 2 and the normalized bias 20 nb x x m o d x o b s x o b s where x o b s and x m o d correspond to the observations and model data respectively ardhuin et al 2010 the normalized bias of h s for the control experiment is generally negative and significant within the southern california bight particularly during the spring reaching values as low as 38 at the goleta buoy in the santa barbara channel these biases are improved with the wind forced solution except at the santa monica buoy in contrast the nrmse s between the control and the solution forced by wind are not very different the solutions forced by winds and currents give generally larger errors than the wind forced solution except for nb at the goleta buoy for the winter solution the overall average nb and nmrse for both seasons give 11 and 23 for the control 5 and 21 for the wind forced solution and 11 and 22 for the cew solution respectively the overall positive bias for the wind forced runs is consistent with the positive bias of the wind speed shown in table 2 also the nrmse of the wind speed is significant on average 54 which also contributes to the wave model performance both wind and currents can enhance h s within the bight especially the wind the winds can significantly improve the model performance in sheltered areas particularly during strong wind events however nrmse values are not much improved with wind or wind and currents which is probably a combination of the need for better physics but more important phase discrepancies because of wrf and roms are not assimilative and thus are event location inaccurate regarding the physics other nonlinear processes not accounted for may be important such as diffraction coherent interference and triad resonant interactions other errors may come from inaccuracies of the approximate four wave resonant interactions and the parameterizations of wind forcing wave breaking and bottom dissipation 3 2 examples and differences due to cew in this section cew is analyzed by comparing the solutions forced by winds wnd to those forced by both winds and currents cew under different wind forcing conditions and different model resolutions l2 and l3 fig 4 shows l2 snapshots during the strongest winter storm on 12 28 composed of wind speed and direction h s and mean wave direction surface stokes drift u s 0 mean square slope mss whitecap coverage w and air entrainment rate due to breaking v a the wind is on average from the northwest reaching speeds of up to 20 m s the incoming waves are also from the northwest with h s reaching 8 m outside the bight the surface stokes drift mss w and v a show good correspondence with the wind field with additional small scale variability due to currents to further characterize cew the output is analyzed through relative differences between the solution forced by wind and currents cew and that only forced by wind wnd for a given variable x the relative difference in percent corresponds to 21 rd x x cew x wnd 1 100 where the subscripts wnd and cew indicate the corresponding solution we also consider the angle differences in mean wave direction δ θ w θ w cew θ w wnd and directional spreading δ σ θ σ θ cew σ θ wnd the model differences for the timeframe in fig 4 with strong winds are shown in figs 5 and 6 corresponding to the l2 and l3 configurations respectively panels a f show relative differences rd of h s u s 0 mss w v a and e d s respectively the mean wave direction difference δ θ w and directional spreading difference anomaly δ σ θ without the spatial mean are shown in panels g and h respectively the surface current divergence δ u x v y and relative vorticity ζ v x u y normalized by the coriolis frequency f are shown in figs 5i j and figs 6i j the h s rd values are within 5 in open ocean reaching 15 in sheltered regions which is consistent with what we see comparing to buoy observations the rd values of the surface stokes drift and mss show similar patterns to that for h s but with increased small scale variability that correlates with the surface current relative vorticity and divergence figs 5i j and 6i j the breaking variables give larger rd magnitudes reaching 15 20 and 30 for w v a and e d s respectively and their distributions show good correspondence to the vorticity and divergence fields the spatial distributions for the difference in mean wave direction δ θ w in open ocean away from sheltered regions show good correspondence with relative differences of h s and those for u s 0 to a lesser extent similarly the directional spreading difference anomalies δ σ θ show inverse relationships with the whitecap coverage w being qualitatively consistent with the observations by romero et al 2017 with increased breaking where the spectrum is narrower the directional spreading biases due to cew calculated as the spatial average of δ σ θ for the data shown is 0 7 and 0 85 for l2 and l3 respectively model snapshots of h s u s 0 mss w and v a zooming over the santa maria basin outside the southern california bight during relatively low winds 10 m s for the l2 and l3 configurations are shown in fig 7 we focus on the santa maria basin in open ocean unaffected by the shadowing and sheltering from land and islands within the bight just as was shown with the high wind event the data exhibit fine scale structure which increases relatively from h s followed by u s 0 mss w and v a the higher moments of the spectrum and breaking variables show strong modulation by cold filaments that can be observed on the north there is also apparent modulation due to a cold core eddy shed by the headland adjacent to it the model differences for the low wind case are shown in figs 8a h and figs 9a h corresponding to l2 and l3 solutions respectively with corresponding normalized surface vorticity and divergence in panels i and j the mean wave direction differences δ θ w show some correspondence with rd h s u s 0 and mss fields over particular regions but the relationship is not very clear similarly the difference in directional spreading is not strongly linked to other rd variables but in certain areas where the spectrum narrows breaking increases as seen earlier with the high wind case the directional spreading bias due to cew for this case is 1 9 and 2 2 for l2 and l3 respectively the relative differences in particular the wave breaking variables show good correspondence with the current gradients 8i j and 9i j the l2 rd magnitudes are much larger for the low wind example compared to the high wind case shown in fig 5 at lower winds the rd values reach magnitudes of about 12 for h s u s 0 and mss and 50 75 and 100 for w v a and e d s respectively the relative differences increase in magnitude with increasing resolution giving values for the l3 configuration reaching 15 in magnitude for h s and magnitudes of up to 70 100 and 120 for w v a and e d s respectively it is expected that further increasing the resolution would increase the relative differences even more specially for the higher moments and wave breaking variables 3 3 statistical variability the differences due to cew are further explored with respect to the wind speed and model resolution over a 7 day period 12 26 2006 1 1 2007 which includes the largest winter storm the statistical analysis was carried out over an area that overlaps with the l2 and l3 configurations located north of point conception dotted white box in fig 1 the root mean square rms relative differences rd rms between solutions forced by winds and currents cew and wind only wnd are plotted in fig 10a for the l2 and l3 solutions and the various wave parameters considered showing decreasing trends with increasing wind speed the rms differences are largest for the total energy dissipation followed by the air entrainment and whitecap coverage varying between 22 and 7 17 and 3 and 14 and 2 respectively the rms differences for h s u s 0 and mss show a weaker decreasing trend with wind speed varying only between 5 and 2 the impact of model resolution on the rms differences for the wave breaking variables is relatively small and negligible at high winds in contrast the model resolution is negligible for the non breaking variables across wind forcing regimes the rms vorticity and divergence also decrease with increasing wind speed being significantly larger for l3 compared to l2 fig 10d the decrease of cew with increasing wind speed is consistent with the decrease of rms vorticity and divergence but also as the wind increases the wind input and breaking restore the wave field to back to equilibrium much faster reducing cew phillips 1984 the average probability density functions pdf of the relative difference normalized by the rms rd rd rms are plotted in fig 10b c for the l2 and l3 configurations respectively the distributions across model resolutions are similar except that the tails of l3 distributions are longer the rd pdf of h s is approximately gaussian black dotted line with approximately zero excess kurtosis whereas that for u s 0 and mss is on average 0 2 the wave breaking distributions have an average skewness and kurtosis of 1 and 4 6 respectively the pdfs of the non breaking variables are approximately symmetric whereas the breaking distributions are positively skewed with longer tails the positive skewness is consistent with the results by phillips 1984 on the response of the spectral saturation due to convergent and divergent currents under the influence of wind forcing and dissipation due to breaking his results showed the saturation response is asymmetric with a larger and highly localized enhancement due to convergence compared to the relative reduction at divergences not only is the response due to surface current convergence divergence asymmetric the statistics of surface current gradients at submesoscales are also skewed mcwilliams 2016 in this analysis the skewness is 1 1 and 1 4 for δ and 2 1 and 2 4 for ζ of the l 2 and l 3 configurations respectively 3 4 spatial variability in this subsection the spatial variability due to cew is further assessed with wavenumber spectra of the relative differences spectra were calculated for the l3 configuration along the main axis of the white dotted box in fig 1a during the fourth week in december 2006 including the largest storm following romero and melville 2010a prior to calculating a wavenumber spectrum data were interpolated on a regular grid at the model resolution detrended and tapered with a hann window the average spectra computed from the relative differences are shown in fig 11a and compared to the spectrum of the surface currents speed u scaled by a factor of 0 01 for clarity the levels of the rd spectra are consistent with the rms values shown in fig 10a with larger variability for the wave breaking variables followed by mss and u s 0 and with the lowest variance for h s similarly the decrease of the spectra with increasing wavenumber is slowest for the wave breaking variables followed by mss and u s 0 with the rd h s spectrum decreasing faster with k than the u spectrum here k denotes the wavenumber of the spectra for the wave variables to differentiate from that of the wave spectrum to better show the differences between spectra of the relative differences psd rd k we plot them in fig 11b normalized by the linear average of the spectral density for wavelengths greater than 10 km according to 22 p s d x k min 0 1 km 1 p s d x k d k 0 1 km 1 k min where k min 1 66 km 1 is the lowest number resolved in the analysis the normalized h s rd spectrum approximately traces the spectrum of the currents u but decays faster for scales shorter than 1 km in contrast the normalized spectra for u s 0 mss and the wave breaking variables deviate from the normalized u spectrum with increasing wavenumber showing larger differences for scales of order 1 km or smaller the study by ardhuin et al 2017 at scales between 5 km and 200 km similarly reported larger variability at shorter scales for the higher moments which are dominated by shorter wave components compared to h s 3 5 seasonal variability and scaling in this subsection the model differences due to cew in the open ocean are further analyzed comparing the one month long l2 winter and spring solutions which are plotted against wind speed in fig 12 the rd rms values are approximately 2 times larger for the winter solution compared to the spring for all variables the rms surface vorticity and divergence are also larger in the winter compared to the spring but only by about 20 similarly the spectrally weighted wave period not shown is on average 11 s in the winter compared to 9 s in spring in other words as expected the rms relative differences due to cew are larger for the winter solution when the current gradients are stronger and mean wave period is larger phillips 1984 here the model differences due to cew across seasons and model resolution are characterized with an empirical scaling as described below phillips 1984 introduced a non dimensional parameter controlling the spectral response of wind forced waves to current variations defined as the product υ i where υ u o l 1 t and i g 2 t 2 2 π u 2 with u o l 1 representing the current gradients t the wave period and u the air side friction velocity we use a dimensionless function ξ υ n i m to scale the rms differences due to cew using the resolved friction velocity u the spectrally weighted mean period t 0 1 and rms vorticity ζ r m s and divergence δ r m s such that υ δ r m s 2 ζ r m s 2 1 2 t 0 1 and i g 2 π t 0 1 u 2 the exponents n m and the dimensionless factor ξ were determined through least squares fitting against the rms relative differences due to cew for the l2 winter and spring solutions and the overlapping l2 and l3 solutions previously analyzed covering a week long period including the largest winter storm fig 13 shows the rd rms values for the different variables against the empirical scaling along with the best fit coefficients and the fraction of variance explained r 2 the r 2 values are 0 83 or larger for all the variables except for h s with r 2 0 66 the best fit coefficients ξ 0 9 0 2 0 6 0 2 1 0 0 4 0 9 0 5 2 3 1 0 and 15 6 and n 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 1 0 and 1 0 and m 0 1 0 3 0 3 0 5 0 5 and 0 3 for rd rms h s u s 0 mss w v a and e d s respectively in an attempt to improve the r 2 value of the rms relative differences of h s we considered the surface current projected onto the mean wave direction according to u w u cos θ w v sin θ w decomposed into a mean a fluctuating part as u w u w u w the best correlation for h s was found against a scaling of the form ξ υ n χ p with χ u w 2 u 2 v 2 with ξ 3 5 0 8 n 0 6 and p 0 3 giving r 2 0 8 all other variables give comparable r 2 values as for the original scaling dependent on the wind forcing in part because of a strong correlation between the mean square current and the friction velocity r 2 0 8 as suggested by one reviewer other scalings based on polynomials formed with the same nondimensional variables were tested and found to give similar r 2 coefficients but the power law scalings are preferred because they tend to zero as the current gradients go to zero also other measures of the wave period e g inverse spectrally weighted wave frequency were tested and found to give qualitatively similar results but with equal or lower r 2 values similarly using the vorticity or divergence alone for the velocity gradient scaling results in differences of r 2 of 0 02 or smaller for all the variables 4 discussion 4 1 current induced refraction in the santa barbara channel regional wave models in southern california without external forcing have reported relatively large errors in the santa barbara channel o reilly and guza 1993 1998 o reilly et al 2016 crosby et al 2016 which have been attributed not only to the reflection of wave energy from the channel islands o reilly et al 1999 but also due to forcing by currents and winds crosby et al 2016 in this study the differences in h s between runs with and without cew were shown to be generally small but occasionally large at the goleta buoy during low winds for example with h s increasing by 60 due to cew on 12 13 in good agreement with the observations the model runs presented did not include reflections at the coastline additional runs were carried out including reflections at the shoreline with source term function by ardhuin and roland 2012 as expected the results did not significantly affect the significant wave height with changes of less than 15 mostly affecting the directional spreading at all buoy locations the effects of currents for the wave field in the santa barbara channel are further analyzed in fig 14 comparing snapshots of h s within the santa barbara channel from the solution forced by winds a and that forced by winds and currents b on 12 13 at 00 00 utc the relative difference along with surface current vectors and wave propagation rays are shown in 14c d respectively rays were computed for the peak wave period 15 s and direction 298 from true north energy from accounting for the refraction due to bathymetry green and both bathymetry and surface current gradients black according to mathiesen 1987 the circulation in the santa barbara channel and in particular the santa barbara eddy result in pronounced effects for the wave energy the areas with relative h s differences within the channel reaching values of 80 overlap with the areas where wave propagation rays converge the amplification of the wave energy due to currents along the mainland coast is relatively large on the eastern side reaching values of up to 50 the effects of the currents on the waves in the santa barbara channel and other sheltered areas could be further explored more accurately with ww3 forced by measured currents from high frequency radars and their uncertainty emery and washburn 2019 and an array of low cost buoys raghukumar et al 2019 or airborne lidar measurements romero and melville 2010a romero et al 2017 4 2 cew contributions and relative wind as described earlier cew within the ww3 framework comes in from advection a refraction r and direct forcing d by currents corresponding to terms 2 4 in eq 1 however surface currents can also affect the wind input s i n through the effective or relative wind which is the vector difference between the surface wind and the current here the different contributions to cew are analyzed with control runs specifically the l2 configuration in deep water during the last week of december 2006 comparing solutions with different forcing the rms relative differences for the different variables are shown in fig 15 color coded according to the enabled physics as indicated in the legend the solution only accounting for advection by currents shows the lowest rms rd values for all the variables refraction is most significant for h s followed by u s 0 and mss being least significant for the breaking variables the direct forcing by current gradients and relative winds are significant for all the variables except for h s the relative winds on average increase the rms relative differences by 30 for the breaking and 15 for u s 0 and mss the dominance of refraction for the modulation of the total energy or h s is consistent with the work by bôas and young 2020 both smit and janssen 2019 and bôas and young 2020 investigated wave diffusion due to refraction and wave action conservation as the wave field propagates through submesoscale and mesoscale turbulent fields over relatively long distances 100 s km the diffusion and energy decay rates are directly tied to the directional spreading in our solutions cew increases the directional spreading on average by 0 9 0 2 with a directional spreading variability of 3 and wave direction variability within 5 at the 95 confidence interval across model resolutions and seasons with a weak inverse dependence on the wind forcing these results are expected to be sensitive to the nonlinear energy fluxes s n l for example the dia compared to exact computations e g tracy and resio 1982 van vledder 2006 but the latter is not yet computationally tractable for regional models in the context of current and depth variations at scales of the order of the wavelength of the longer waves o 100 m the wkb approximation is not valid and coherent interferences become important these effects are phase dependent but can be explored with phase average spectral models within the framework of smit and janssen 2013 and akrish et al 2020 also feedback due to wec can be significant on submesoscale processes such as fronts and filaments suzuki et al 2016 mcwilliams 2018 which will in turn affect cew future work will explore both cew and wec with a fully coupled model configuration 4 3 wave breaking variability and feedbacks at submesoscales the results show that cew is significant for breaking at scales of order 1 km and smaller which is qualitatively consistent with the measurements by romero et al 2017 the variability of wave breaking is strongly coupled to sharp surface current gradients where the flow is strongly three dimensional this implies that air sea fluxes for example gas transfer may be enhanced due to wave current interactions over areas with increased submesoscale activity like the southern ocean however both roms and ww3 at the sub kilometer resolutions are computationally expensive not realistically feasible for global applications in addition to the coupling between wave breaking and surface current variability the statistical distributions for the wave breaking variables are strongly skewed with larger positive values which may result in potentially important effects on air sea fluxes due to wave breaking globally the pdfs of the model solutions with and without cew combined with the empirical scaling of the rms differences could be used for stochastic analysis of the impacts of cew at global scales the relatively larger impact of cew on the energy dissipation and rate of air entrainment compared to the whitecap coverage besides the fact that they depend on different moments of λ is due to the additional nonlinear dependence on b k in eqs 18 and 9 taking the results in romero 2019 from idealized runs for developing waves with constant winds we find that v a w 1 25 and e d s w 1 66 these relationships exhibit substantial variability due to wave age that is not accounted for with these simple power laws nevertheless the exponents imply that the relative differences of v a and e d s due to cew compared to those of w would be 1 25 and 1 66 times larger respectively these factors are qualitatively consistent with the enhancement of rd rms in figs 10a and 12a b for v a and e d s compared to w the results showed that cew is significant for wave breaking at low winds 10 m s which is representative of global mean values semedo et al 2011 in fact the observed average wind speed over the ocean is about 7 m s freilich and challenor 1994 rodriguez 2018 several parameterizations in the literature of wave breaking and related air sea fluxes depend on wind speed or friction velocity and wave age or h s brumer et al 2017a b deike and melville 2018 reichl and deike 2020 but as shown here and by romero et al 2017 the wave breaking variability due to currents at scales of 1 km or smaller cannot be accounted for through h s instead a measure of the current gradients at scales of less than 1 km along with the friction velocity and mean wave period may lead to improved parameterizations of wave breaking and related air sea fluxes in the context of upper ocean processes the modeling study by gerbi et al 2013 investigated the effect of the turbulent kinetic energy flux induced by wave breaking on the dynamics of buoyant plumes their results show that wave breaking induced mixing results in deeper and narrower plumes with weaker vertical gradients of temperature and salinity affecting the plume evolution in that study wave breaking was parameterized as a function of the wind stress not accounting for cew as shown here the wave breaking is strongly modulated at submesoscales due to cew which may lead to nontrivial effects on the evolution and dynamics of fronts and plumes similarly the ocean side stress explicitly accounting wave breaking will be highly structured due to cew and correlated with submesoscale flow structures such as fronts filaments and eddies more generally heterogeneous wave fields due to cew will make heterogeneous wave effects on currents wec through stokes drift vertical mixing and surface stress moreover fully coupled ocean wave atmospheric models may also affect the eddy killer effect in which the feedback acts as a sink of energy in both the ocean and the atmosphere due to the coupling renault et al 2016 5 conclusions we presented a modeling study of current effects on waves with a realistic nested configuration in southern california at high resolutions 270 m l2 and 100 m l3 the analysis compared two one month long periods during the winter 2006 and spring 2007 with relatively active wave climates solutions without external forcing were used to assess model performance regarding the importance of the winds and currents particularly within sheltered areas wind forcing can significantly reduce model biases in the southern california bight particularly in the santa barbara channel in low wind conditions the significant wave height in the santa barbara channel can increase by up to 50 along the main coast of santa barbara and by up to 80 within the santa barbara channel due to current induced refraction in open ocean cew is most significant at low winds and increases with model resolution due to increased submesoscale activity l2 solutions forced by currents compared to those without in 10 m s winds give differences of 12 for h s surface stokes drift and mss and can reach 50 or more for the whitecap coverage w and the volume of entrained air v a and energy dissipation e d s by breaking waves for the higher resolution solution l3 these values become 15 and 70 or larger respectively cew on average increases the directional spreading by 0 9 0 2 with 3 variability and modulates the mean wave direction within 5 a statistical analysis of the model differences due to cew when normalized by the rms variability result in approximately self similar distributions independent of model resolution with h s well represented by the gaussian distribution stokes drift and mss symmetric with finite excess kurtosis and the wave breaking variables w v a and e d s positively skewed with finite excess kurtosis cew is stronger for the winter solution compared to the spring fig 13 an empirical scaling based on the rms current gradients air side friction velocity and mean wavelength explain most of the variability due to cew across the two seasons and the two model resolutions considered fig 13 with r 2 0 8 or larger except for h s with r 2 0 66 wavenumber spectra of model differences due to cew are proportional to the spectrum of the surface current magnitude however the difference spectrum for h s decreases faster with decreasing scale than the current spectrum for scales smaller than 1 km in contrast the surface stokes drift mss and wave breaking variables decay less steeply with decreasing scale than the current spectrum across the range of scales analyzed 10 s km to 100 s m with the largest variability compared to the current spectrum at small scales for the wave breaking variables considered namely whitecap coverage air entrainment rate and energy dissipation rate future work will characterize wave effects on currents wec due to both conservative and non conservative effects within the framework of mcwilliams et al 2004 and uchiyama et al 2010 with our testbed including higher resolutions better resolving nearshore processes other efforts will investigate the impact of wave current interactions on co 2 fluxes credit authorship contribution statement leonel romero conceptualization methodology validation

23956,we present a numerical study of current effects on waves cew at submesoscales 100 s of m 10 s of km with a realistic model configuration in southern california cew is analyzed by comparing solutions forced by winds with and without current forcing through relative differences the modulation of wave field due to currents is larger for the wave breaking variables i e whitecap coverage air entrainment and energy dissipation followed by the resolved mean square slope surface stokes drift and the significant wave height background currents on average increase the directional spreading by 0 9 and modulate the mean wave direction within 5 cew decreases with increasing wind speed because the rms current gradients also decrease while the wind forcing and breaking restore the wave field towards equilibrium faster at higher winds empirical scalings based on the mean wave period rms current gradients and friction velocity are found to explain 80 or more of the variability for the model differences due to cew except for the significant wave height explaining 66 of the variability the statistics of model differences due to cew are approximately gaussian for the significant wave height symmetric with finite excess kurtosis for the higher spectral moments and positively skewed with excess kurtosis for the wave breaking variables keywords wave current interactions current effects on waves air sea fluxes wave breaking 1 introduction wave current interactions can be divided into current effects on waves cew and wave effects on currents wec this study is concerned with the former in particular the modulation of the wave field at submesoscales o 1 km or smaller in recent years cew has gained interest in the literature due to its relevance for remote sensing the modulation of wave breaking and related air sea fluxes and the incidence of extreme waves janssen and herbers 2009 hjelmervik and trulsen 2009 onorato et al 2011 moreover cew allows for the investigation of the wave spectrum modulation from wind wave equilibrium phillips 1984 kudryavtsev et al 2017 reported a novel characterization of the wave spectral variability due to currents inverting spectra from satellite sun glitter imagery with supporting altimeter data ardhuin et al 2017 used satellite altimetry and realistic models to show that the modulation of the wave field by currents at scales from 10 s to 100 s of kilometers is significant with the significant wave height varying by more than 50 at scales of 10 s of km quilfen et al 2018 presented an analysis of the wave field across the agulhas current with satellite altimeter and synthetic aperture radar sar finding consistent patterns with a wave model forced with surface currents from altimeter but the impacts due to currents were under predicted the global analysis of satellite altimetry data by quilfen and chapron 2019 showed a clear relation between the dominant mode of spatial variability of the wave field and that of the sea surface topography indicating a strong coupling of the wave field to ocean currents at mesoscales supporting the findings of kudryavtsev et al 2017 and ardhuin et al 2017 romero et al 2017 reported airborne field observations of the wave field modulation by currents at the edge of an upwelling jet in northern california and the loop current in the gulf of mexico the results showed significant variability of the wave field particularly for the wave breaking statistics with the significant slope varying by 15 the directional spreading by 4 and the whitecap coverage by 50 or larger the whitecap coverage correlated well with the spectral saturation and inversely with the directional spreading their measurements showed enhanced wave breaking along a submesoscale front at the edge of the upwelling jet and a reduction of the winds at 30 m above mean sea level which is consistent with an increase of the drag along the front due to enhanced wave breaking rascle et al 2014 2016 developed techniques for the retrieval of surface current gradient information based on remote sensing measurements of ocean surface roughness which were further validated with airborne remote observations against in situ measurements collected with surface drifters rascle et al 2017 in this study cew is investigated numerically with the model wavewatch iii ww3 forced by the regional ocean modeling system roms and the weather research and forecasting model wrf with a realistic model configuration at very high resolutions o 100 m in southern california wave models in southern california have commonly focused on the swell band without external forcing by winds or currents o reilly and guza 1993 1998 o reilly et al 2016 crosby et al 2016 the lack of wind forcing has resulted in significant errors in sheltered areas particularly in the santa barbara channel the work by rogers et al 2007 with the model simulating waves nearshore swan forced with global operational winds and wave boundary conditions from operational wavewatch iii ww3 concluded that both boundary conditions and atmospheric forcing are critical for the model performance within the bight the recent study by cao et al 2018 with swan forced with wrf and boundary conditions from global reanalysis by european centre medium range weather forecasts era interim found qualitative agreement against buoy observations for a 10 year period they also suggest that currents can significantly affect the wave field within the bight this study expands on previous studies by investigating cew including wave breaking at very high model resolutions with a realistic model configuration the manuscript is organized as follows in section 2 we described the model physics and configuration the results are presented in section 3 followed by a discussion and conclusions in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 methods the wave model wavewatch iii the wavewatch iii development group ww3dg 2016 was implemented in southern california the spectral evolution of the directional wave spectrum f k is modeled through the wave action conservation equation 1 n k t x x n k θ θ n k k k n k s i n s n l s d s s b o t σ 2 x c g u 3 θ 1 k σ h h m k u m 4 k

depth c g σ k is the group velocity and u is the surface current vector s is a coordinate in the θ direction and m is a coordinate perpendicular to s tolman and booij 1998 the second term on the left side of eq 1 is the advection the third term is the refraction and the fourth term is direct forcing by topography and current variations all three contributing to wec through u the source terms on the right side of eq 1 correspond to the wind energy input s i n nonlinear energy flux due to wave wave resonant interactions s n l energy dissipation due to wave breaking s d s and energy loss due to bottom friction s b o t the directional wavenumber spectrum f k is defined such that 5 e η 2 f k θ k d k d θ where η 2 is the variance of the sea surface elevation the corresponding azimuth integrated

the relative frequency f σ 2 π 1 according to 7 f f θ 2 π k c g f k θ with corresponding frequency spectrum 8 ψ f f f θ d θ 2 1 model physics the first three source terms on the right side of eq 1 are related to wind wave generation the wind input s i n is modeled according to ardhuin et al 2010 based on the quasilinear theory by janssen 1989 1991 including sheltering at short waves due to longer waves and swell dissipation the nonlinear energy fluxes s n l are computed with the discrete interaction approximation dia hasselmann and hasselmann 1985 and the energy dissipation due to deep water wave breaking s d s is modeled according to romero 2019 within the framework of phillips λ distribution phillips 1985 which was validated against the field measurements by sutherland and melville 2013 the wave breaking model s d s is summarized below for completeness the bottom friction is computed with a parameterization for a movable sandy bed by ardhuin et al 2003 switch option bt4 of ww3 the source terms were integrated allowing the resolved tail to evolve freely without a prognostic tail romero and melville 2010b liu et al 2019 2 2 wave breaking model the spectral dissipation s d s k is computed through λ k which is the length of breaking crest per unit bandwidth and unit area according to 9 s d s k b k g 2 λ k c 5 where b k is the strength of breaking and is modeled with a threshold dependence on the omnidirectional saturation b k ϕ k k 3 as 10 b k a b k 1 2 b t 1 2 5 2 with a 3 8 and b t 1 1 1 0 3 romero et al 2012 the λ k distribution is modeled as 11 λ k l k exp b b r b k m l k m w k where the exponential factor dependent on the two dimensional saturation b k f k k 4 is based on a scaling of wave slope statistics assuming self similarity with b b r 5 1 0 3 and l 3 5 1 0 5 the function m l k accounts for the breaking modulation by the longer waves and m w k is a breaking amplification for the short waves to balance the wind input the wave breaking modulation due to longer waves is modeled according to 12 m l k 1 400 cmss k cos 2 θ θ w 3 2 where the cumulative mean squared slope 13 cmss k 0 k ϕ k k 2 d k and θ w is the spectrally weighted mean wave direction defined as 14 θ w atan f k sin θ d k f k cos θ d k the anisotropic function m l k controls the directional spreading and it was tuned against the measurements by romero and melville 2010a the wind modulation function is modeled linearly according to 15 m w k 1 1 9 1 0 9 max 1 k k o with k o u g 3 28 u 2 thus m w k is greater than one for k k o 1 and equal to one otherwise balancing the wind input at large wavenumbers to maintaining a saturation level approximately consistent with the field observations i e romero and melville 2010a and lenain and melville 2017 by definition the total length of breaking crests per unit surface area l is given by 16 l λ k d k and higher moments of λ k are related to different physical parameters assuming that the phase speed of waves is proportional to the speed of the breaking fronts 1 1 see discussion in romero 2019 the probability of breaking at a point corresponds to p b λ k c d k following kleiss and melville 2010 the whitecap coverage is modeled according to 17 w 2 π g γ c 2 λ k d k where γ is a dimensionless factor representing the duration of breaking relative to the wave period 2 π c g the factor of γ here is 30 larger than that of romero 2019 to account for the limited bandwidth the rate of air volume entrained by breaking waves per unit area v a is modeled according to deike et al 2017 as given by 18 v a χ a g b 1 2 k b t 1 2 3 2 c 3 λ k d k where a is the proportionality factor of the strength of breaking 10 and χ 0 2 is a constant representing the ratio between the work done by buoyancy forces and mechanical dissipation 2 3 model configuration ww3 was implemented using a roms nested configuration described in dauhajre et al 2019 specifically the 270 m l2 and 100 m l3 configurations which are shown in fig 1a the largest l0 domain with a resolution of 4 km covers the entire u s west coast as described by renault et al 2016 the model is hydrostatic and does not assimilate observations instead the l0 boundary conditions are from the simple ocean data assimilation soda reanalysis carton and giese 2008 barotropic tides are introduced at the boundaries of the next level of nesting l1 with a resolution of 1 km the l2 and l3 bathymetry consists of the srtm30 plus dataset becker et al 2009 blended with the noaa ngdc coastal relief dataset the wind forcing is from a regional implementation of the weather and research forecasting model wrf with a horizontal resolution of 6 km renault et al 2016 the roms configuration without data assimilation is expected to produce realistic mesoscale and submesoscale features in a statistical sense as opposed to deterministic e g buijsman et al 2012 romero et al 2013 uchiyama et al 2014 romero et al 2016 the solutions also include hydrostatic internal tides which are only evident in certain regions as they become incoherent from their interaction with mesoscale and submesoscale processes van haren 2004 ponte and klein 2015 kumar et al 2019 two periods were selected for this study the month of december 2006 and the period between march 15 through april 15 in 2007 the periods were chosen because of the relatively active wave climate with the significant wave height h s reaching 8 5 m in the winter and 5 5 m in the spring in exposed areas wave boundary conditions were generated using buoy observations at the harvest buoy from the coastal data information program cdip other buoys with supporting wind and wave observations within the domain were used for model validation a total of 7 cdip buoys collected wave measurements during the periods of interest which are in order from the north diablo canyon harvest goleta rincon anacapa santa monica and san pedro canyon see locations in fig 1b five buoys from the national data buoy center ndbc collected wind and wave observations 46011 46054 46053 46025 46069 see fig 1b with the exception of 46011 which did not operate during the winter the deep water buoys exposed to open ocean swell are the harvest buoy 46011 in the santa maria basin and 46069 south of santa rosa island following o reilly et al 2016 the harvest buoy data was used to generate boundary conditions accounting for the appropriate time lag determined by the distance between a given boundary point and the buoy divided by the deep water group speed this was done at all frequencies and directions projected along the shortest path to the buoy location prior to calculating the boundary conditions the buoy observations i e frequency spectra and directional fourier coefficients at half hour intervals were temporally smoothed using a running filter 11 point hann window with an effective decorrelation timescale of 2 5 h there are many ways to calculate the directional distribution from buoy measurements all of which are method dependent benoit 1992 the two most widely used methods to estimate wave directional distribution are the maximum likelihood method capon 1969 and the maximum entropy method lygre and krogstad 1986 we used the maximum entropy method which gives narrower spectra and is the preferred method used by cdip due to the narrowness of the swell band since the predominant waves during spring and winter in southern california are from the nw w boundary conditions generated only using the harvest buoy are sufficient for other seasons with significant wave energy coming from the south other buoys can be combined to provide adequate boundary conditions e g o reilly et al 2016 the spectral grid used consists of 24 directions δ θ 1 5 and 22 frequencies between 0 037 and 0 7 hz with logarithmic increment δ f f 0 15 the choice to use a relatively coarse grid as opposed to the standard grid with δ f f 0 1 was to reduce the computational cost preliminary tests showed that our results were not sensitive to using a coarser grid the propagation scheme used is the third order ultimate quickest with spatial averaging tolman 2002 several runs were carried out for comparison including control runs with depth induced refraction only without external forcing ctl runs forced by wind wnd and runs forced by both wind and currents cew surface currents from roms were used to force the model using the vertical grid point closest to the surface this choice was made for simplicity but it would be more appropriate to use scale and depth dependent current velocities stewart and joy 1974 at the expense of increasing the number of input parameters into ww3 the model runs are summarized and labeled in table 1 the l2 l3 global and source term time steps were set to 40 s 12 s with spatial and intra spectral propagation time steps of 8 s 4 s and 20 s 6 s respectively model output was saved at hourly intervals which is composed of directional wave spectra at the buoy locations and gridded output the gridded output includes significant wave height h s 4 e 1 2 mean wave period or so called energy period t 0 1 e 1 ψ f f 1 d f mean wave direction θ w atan b a with a f

observations time series of the significant wave height h s for the l2 configurations at harvest goleta and san pedro canyon are compared against the buoy data in fig 2 the comparison at harvest buoy is in excellent agreement serving as a check for the boundary conditions the model solutions within the southern california bight at goleta and san pedro buoys without wind forcing significantly underestimate h s with larger errors in the spring the solutions forced by wind wnd show significant improvement with good agreement with the observations particularly during large wave events but with appreciable errors at higher temporal variability diurnal the high frequency variability of the h s solutions forced by wind shows good correspondence with the local wind variability from wrf shown on the top of each panel the model solution forced by both winds and currents cew generally tracks the solution only forced by wind wnd however occasionally the cew solution shows significant deviations at the goleta buoy within the santa barbara channel during periods of relatively low winds 10 m s see for example 12 13 and 12 17 in fig 2b and 3 24 and 3 27 in fig 2e direct comparisons of omnidirectional and directional frequency spectra during the largest storm on dec 28 00 00 utc and a period of low wind dominated by swell on 12 18 6 00 utc at harvest goleta and san pedro buoys are shown in figs 3a c and 3d f respectively as expected the control run underestimates the energy particularly at high frequencies with smaller errors during low winds the wind forced spectra are in good agreement with the buoy observations at all three buoys during the storm the observations and model approximately match the saturation spectrum g 2 2 π 2 b f 5 by romero and melville 2010a at frequencies larger than 0 2 hz at lower wavenumbers and lower wind speeds the spectral tail is better represented by the f 4 equilibrium range model by resio et al 2004 the corresponding directional spectra forced by wind wnd compare qualitatively well against the buoy measurements for the two periods shown however as shown in fig 2 the model errors can be significant at times partly due to wind forcing errors as can be seen in the high frequency fluctuation in fig 2e f correlated to wind fluctuations the cew solutions are also shown generally tracking the wnd solutions with larger differences near the spectral peak at the goleta buoy in low winds fig 3e the overall model performance is further quantified at each buoy for the two periods in table 2 given a variable x the normalized root mean square error is defined as 19 nrmse x x m o d x o b s 2 x o b s 2 and the normalized bias 20 nb x x m o d x o b s x o b s where x o b s and x m o d correspond to the observations and model data respectively ardhuin et al 2010 the normalized bias of h s for the control experiment is generally negative and significant within the southern california bight particularly during the spring reaching values as low as 38 at the goleta buoy in the santa barbara channel these biases are improved with the wind forced solution except at the santa monica buoy in contrast the nrmse s between the control and the solution forced by wind are not very different the solutions forced by winds and currents give generally larger errors than the wind forced solution except for nb at the goleta buoy for the winter solution the overall average nb and nmrse for both seasons give 11 and 23 for the control 5 and 21 for the wind forced solution and 11 and 22 for the cew solution respectively the overall positive bias for the wind forced runs is consistent with the positive bias of the wind speed shown in table 2 also the nrmse of the wind speed is significant on average 54 which also contributes to the wave model performance both wind and currents can enhance h s within the bight especially the wind the winds can significantly improve the model performance in sheltered areas particularly during strong wind events however nrmse values are not much improved with wind or wind and currents which is probably a combination of the need for better physics but more important phase discrepancies because of wrf and roms are not assimilative and thus are event location inaccurate regarding the physics other nonlinear processes not accounted for may be important such as diffraction coherent interference and triad resonant interactions other errors may come from inaccuracies of the approximate four wave resonant interactions and the parameterizations of wind forcing wave breaking and bottom dissipation 3 2 examples and differences due to cew in this section cew is analyzed by comparing the solutions forced by winds wnd to those forced by both winds and currents cew under different wind forcing conditions and different model resolutions l2 and l3 fig 4 shows l2 snapshots during the strongest winter storm on 12 28 composed of wind speed and direction h s and mean wave direction surface stokes drift u s 0 mean square slope mss whitecap coverage w and air entrainment rate due to breaking v a the wind is on average from the northwest reaching speeds of up to 20 m s the incoming waves are also from the northwest with h s reaching 8 m outside the bight the surface stokes drift mss w and v a show good correspondence with the wind field with additional small scale variability due to currents to further characterize cew the output is analyzed through relative differences between the solution forced by wind and currents cew and that only forced by wind wnd for a given variable x the relative difference in percent corresponds to 21 rd x x cew x wnd 1 100 where the subscripts wnd and cew indicate the corresponding solution we also consider the angle differences in mean wave direction δ θ w θ w cew θ w wnd and directional spreading δ σ θ σ θ cew σ θ wnd the model differences for the timeframe in fig 4 with strong winds are shown in figs 5 and 6 corresponding to the l2 and l3 configurations respectively panels a f show relative differences rd of h s u s 0 mss w v a and e d s respectively the mean wave direction difference δ θ w and directional spreading difference anomaly δ σ θ without the spatial mean are shown in panels g and h respectively the surface current divergence δ u x v y and relative vorticity ζ v x u y normalized by the coriolis frequency f are shown in figs 5i j and figs 6i j the h s rd values are within 5 in open ocean reaching 15 in sheltered regions which is consistent with what we see comparing to buoy observations the rd values of the surface stokes drift and mss show similar patterns to that for h s but with increased small scale variability that correlates with the surface current relative vorticity and divergence figs 5i j and 6i j the breaking variables give larger rd magnitudes reaching 15 20 and 30 for w v a and e d s respectively and their distributions show good correspondence to the vorticity and divergence fields the spatial distributions for the difference in mean wave direction δ θ w in open ocean away from sheltered regions show good correspondence with relative differences of h s and those for u s 0 to a lesser extent similarly the directional spreading difference anomalies δ σ θ show inverse relationships with the whitecap coverage w being qualitatively consistent with the observations by romero et al 2017 with increased breaking where the spectrum is narrower the directional spreading biases due to cew calculated as the spatial average of δ σ θ for the data shown is 0 7 and 0 85 for l2 and l3 respectively model snapshots of h s u s 0 mss w and v a zooming over the santa maria basin outside the southern california bight during relatively low winds 10 m s for the l2 and l3 configurations are shown in fig 7 we focus on the santa maria basin in open ocean unaffected by the shadowing and sheltering from land and islands within the bight just as was shown with the high wind event the data exhibit fine scale structure which increases relatively from h s followed by u s 0 mss w and v a the higher moments of the spectrum and breaking variables show strong modulation by cold filaments that can be observed on the north there is also apparent modulation due to a cold core eddy shed by the headland adjacent to it the model differences for the low wind case are shown in figs 8a h and figs 9a h corresponding to l2 and l3 solutions respectively with corresponding normalized surface vorticity and divergence in panels i and j the mean wave direction differences δ θ w show some correspondence with rd h s u s 0 and mss fields over particular regions but the relationship is not very clear similarly the difference in directional spreading is not strongly linked to other rd variables but in certain areas where the spectrum narrows breaking increases as seen earlier with the high wind case the directional spreading bias due to cew for this case is 1 9 and 2 2 for l2 and l3 respectively the relative differences in particular the wave breaking variables show good correspondence with the current gradients 8i j and 9i j the l2 rd magnitudes are much larger for the low wind example compared to the high wind case shown in fig 5 at lower winds the rd values reach magnitudes of about 12 for h s u s 0 and mss and 50 75 and 100 for w v a and e d s respectively the relative differences increase in magnitude with increasing resolution giving values for the l3 configuration reaching 15 in magnitude for h s and magnitudes of up to 70 100 and 120 for w v a and e d s respectively it is expected that further increasing the resolution would increase the relative differences even more specially for the higher moments and wave breaking variables 3 3 statistical variability the differences due to cew are further explored with respect to the wind speed and model resolution over a 7 day period 12 26 2006 1 1 2007 which includes the largest winter storm the statistical analysis was carried out over an area that overlaps with the l2 and l3 configurations located north of point conception dotted white box in fig 1 the root mean square rms relative differences rd rms between solutions forced by winds and currents cew and wind only wnd are plotted in fig 10a for the l2 and l3 solutions and the various wave parameters considered showing decreasing trends with increasing wind speed the rms differences are largest for the total energy dissipation followed by the air entrainment and whitecap coverage varying between 22 and 7 17 and 3 and 14 and 2 respectively the rms differences for h s u s 0 and mss show a weaker decreasing trend with wind speed varying only between 5 and 2 the impact of model resolution on the rms differences for the wave breaking variables is relatively small and negligible at high winds in contrast the model resolution is negligible for the non breaking variables across wind forcing regimes the rms vorticity and divergence also decrease with increasing wind speed being significantly larger for l3 compared to l2 fig 10d the decrease of cew with increasing wind speed is consistent with the decrease of rms vorticity and divergence but also as the wind increases the wind input and breaking restore the wave field to back to equilibrium much faster reducing cew phillips 1984 the average probability density functions pdf of the relative difference normalized by the rms rd rd rms are plotted in fig 10b c for the l2 and l3 configurations respectively the distributions across model resolutions are similar except that the tails of l3 distributions are longer the rd pdf of h s is approximately gaussian black dotted line with approximately zero excess kurtosis whereas that for u s 0 and mss is on average 0 2 the wave breaking distributions have an average skewness and kurtosis of 1 and 4 6 respectively the pdfs of the non breaking variables are approximately symmetric whereas the breaking distributions are positively skewed with longer tails the positive skewness is consistent with the results by phillips 1984 on the response of the spectral saturation due to convergent and divergent currents under the influence of wind forcing and dissipation due to breaking his results showed the saturation response is asymmetric with a larger and highly localized enhancement due to convergence compared to the relative reduction at divergences not only is the response due to surface current convergence divergence asymmetric the statistics of surface current gradients at submesoscales are also skewed mcwilliams 2016 in this analysis the skewness is 1 1 and 1 4 for δ and 2 1 and 2 4 for ζ of the l 2 and l 3 configurations respectively 3 4 spatial variability in this subsection the spatial variability due to cew is further assessed with wavenumber spectra of the relative differences spectra were calculated for the l3 configuration along the main axis of the white dotted box in fig 1a during the fourth week in december 2006 including the largest storm following romero and melville 2010a prior to calculating a wavenumber spectrum data were interpolated on a regular grid at the model resolution detrended and tapered with a hann window the average spectra computed from the relative differences are shown in fig 11a and compared to the spectrum of the surface currents speed u scaled by a factor of 0 01 for clarity the levels of the rd spectra are consistent with the rms values shown in fig 10a with larger variability for the wave breaking variables followed by mss and u s 0 and with the lowest variance for h s similarly the decrease of the spectra with increasing wavenumber is slowest for the wave breaking variables followed by mss and u s 0 with the rd h s spectrum decreasing faster with k than the u spectrum here k denotes the wavenumber of the spectra for the wave variables to differentiate from that of the wave spectrum to better show the differences between spectra of the relative differences psd rd k we plot them in fig 11b normalized by the linear average of the spectral density for wavelengths greater than 10 km according to 22 p s d x k min 0 1 km 1 p s d x k d k 0 1 km 1 k min where k min 1 66 km 1 is the lowest number resolved in the analysis the normalized h s rd spectrum approximately traces the spectrum of the currents u but decays faster for scales shorter than 1 km in contrast the normalized spectra for u s 0 mss and the wave breaking variables deviate from the normalized u spectrum with increasing wavenumber showing larger differences for scales of order 1 km or smaller the study by ardhuin et al 2017 at scales between 5 km and 200 km similarly reported larger variability at shorter scales for the higher moments which are dominated by shorter wave components compared to h s 3 5 seasonal variability and scaling in this subsection the model differences due to cew in the open ocean are further analyzed comparing the one month long l2 winter and spring solutions which are plotted against wind speed in fig 12 the rd rms values are approximately 2 times larger for the winter solution compared to the spring for all variables the rms surface vorticity and divergence are also larger in the winter compared to the spring but only by about 20 similarly the spectrally weighted wave period not shown is on average 11 s in the winter compared to 9 s in spring in other words as expected the rms relative differences due to cew are larger for the winter solution when the current gradients are stronger and mean wave period is larger phillips 1984 here the model differences due to cew across seasons and model resolution are characterized with an empirical scaling as described below phillips 1984 introduced a non dimensional parameter controlling the spectral response of wind forced waves to current variations defined as the product υ i where υ u o l 1 t and i g 2 t 2 2 π u 2 with u o l 1 representing the current gradients t the wave period and u the air side friction velocity we use a dimensionless function ξ υ n i m to scale the rms differences due to cew using the resolved friction velocity u the spectrally weighted mean period t 0 1 and rms vorticity ζ r m s and divergence δ r m s such that υ δ r m s 2 ζ r m s 2 1 2 t 0 1 and i g 2 π t 0 1 u 2 the exponents n m and the dimensionless factor ξ were determined through least squares fitting against the rms relative differences due to cew for the l2 winter and spring solutions and the overlapping l2 and l3 solutions previously analyzed covering a week long period including the largest winter storm fig 13 shows the rd rms values for the different variables against the empirical scaling along with the best fit coefficients and the fraction of variance explained r 2 the r 2 values are 0 83 or larger for all the variables except for h s with r 2 0 66 the best fit coefficients ξ 0 9 0 2 0 6 0 2 1 0 0 4 0 9 0 5 2 3 1 0 and 15 6 and n 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 1 0 and 1 0 and m 0 1 0 3 0 3 0 5 0 5 and 0 3 for rd rms h s u s 0 mss w v a and e d s respectively in an attempt to improve the r 2 value of the rms relative differences of h s we considered the surface current projected onto the mean wave direction according to u w u cos θ w v sin θ w decomposed into a mean a fluctuating part as u w u w u w the best correlation for h s was found against a scaling of the form ξ υ n χ p with χ u w 2 u 2 v 2 with ξ 3 5 0 8 n 0 6 and p 0 3 giving r 2 0 8 all other variables give comparable r 2 values as for the original scaling dependent on the wind forcing in part because of a strong correlation between the mean square current and the friction velocity r 2 0 8 as suggested by one reviewer other scalings based on polynomials formed with the same nondimensional variables were tested and found to give similar r 2 coefficients but the power law scalings are preferred because they tend to zero as the current gradients go to zero also other measures of the wave period e g inverse spectrally weighted wave frequency were tested and found to give qualitatively similar results but with equal or lower r 2 values similarly using the vorticity or divergence alone for the velocity gradient scaling results in differences of r 2 of 0 02 or smaller for all the variables 4 discussion 4 1 current induced refraction in the santa barbara channel regional wave models in southern california without external forcing have reported relatively large errors in the santa barbara channel o reilly and guza 1993 1998 o reilly et al 2016 crosby et al 2016 which have been attributed not only to the reflection of wave energy from the channel islands o reilly et al 1999 but also due to forcing by currents and winds crosby et al 2016 in this study the differences in h s between runs with and without cew were shown to be generally small but occasionally large at the goleta buoy during low winds for example with h s increasing by 60 due to cew on 12 13 in good agreement with the observations the model runs presented did not include reflections at the coastline additional runs were carried out including reflections at the shoreline with source term function by ardhuin and roland 2012 as expected the results did not significantly affect the significant wave height with changes of less than 15 mostly affecting the directional spreading at all buoy locations the effects of currents for the wave field in the santa barbara channel are further analyzed in fig 14 comparing snapshots of h s within the santa barbara channel from the solution forced by winds a and that forced by winds and currents b on 12 13 at 00 00 utc the relative difference along with surface current vectors and wave propagation rays are shown in 14c d respectively rays were computed for the peak wave period 15 s and direction 298 from true north energy from accounting for the refraction due to bathymetry green and both bathymetry and surface current gradients black according to mathiesen 1987 the circulation in the santa barbara channel and in particular the santa barbara eddy result in pronounced effects for the wave energy the areas with relative h s differences within the channel reaching values of 80 overlap with the areas where wave propagation rays converge the amplification of the wave energy due to currents along the mainland coast is relatively large on the eastern side reaching values of up to 50 the effects of the currents on the waves in the santa barbara channel and other sheltered areas could be further explored more accurately with ww3 forced by measured currents from high frequency radars and their uncertainty emery and washburn 2019 and an array of low cost buoys raghukumar et al 2019 or airborne lidar measurements romero and melville 2010a romero et al 2017 4 2 cew contributions and relative wind as described earlier cew within the ww3 framework comes in from advection a refraction r and direct forcing d by currents corresponding to terms 2 4 in eq 1 however surface currents can also affect the wind input s i n through the effective or relative wind which is the vector difference between the surface wind and the current here the different contributions to cew are analyzed with control runs specifically the l2 configuration in deep water during the last week of december 2006 comparing solutions with different forcing the rms relative differences for the different variables are shown in fig 15 color coded according to the enabled physics as indicated in the legend the solution only accounting for advection by currents shows the lowest rms rd values for all the variables refraction is most significant for h s followed by u s 0 and mss being least significant for the breaking variables the direct forcing by current gradients and relative winds are significant for all the variables except for h s the relative winds on average increase the rms relative differences by 30 for the breaking and 15 for u s 0 and mss the dominance of refraction for the modulation of the total energy or h s is consistent with the work by bôas and young 2020 both smit and janssen 2019 and bôas and young 2020 investigated wave diffusion due to refraction and wave action conservation as the wave field propagates through submesoscale and mesoscale turbulent fields over relatively long distances 100 s km the diffusion and energy decay rates are directly tied to the directional spreading in our solutions cew increases the directional spreading on average by 0 9 0 2 with a directional spreading variability of 3 and wave direction variability within 5 at the 95 confidence interval across model resolutions and seasons with a weak inverse dependence on the wind forcing these results are expected to be sensitive to the nonlinear energy fluxes s n l for example the dia compared to exact computations e g tracy and resio 1982 van vledder 2006 but the latter is not yet computationally tractable for regional models in the context of current and depth variations at scales of the order of the wavelength of the longer waves o 100 m the wkb approximation is not valid and coherent interferences become important these effects are phase dependent but can be explored with phase average spectral models within the framework of smit and janssen 2013 and akrish et al 2020 also feedback due to wec can be significant on submesoscale processes such as fronts and filaments suzuki et al 2016 mcwilliams 2018 which will in turn affect cew future work will explore both cew and wec with a fully coupled model configuration 4 3 wave breaking variability and feedbacks at submesoscales the results show that cew is significant for breaking at scales of order 1 km and smaller which is qualitatively consistent with the measurements by romero et al 2017 the variability of wave breaking is strongly coupled to sharp surface current gradients where the flow is strongly three dimensional this implies that air sea fluxes for example gas transfer may be enhanced due to wave current interactions over areas with increased submesoscale activity like the southern ocean however both roms and ww3 at the sub kilometer resolutions are computationally expensive not realistically feasible for global applications in addition to the coupling between wave breaking and surface current variability the statistical distributions for the wave breaking variables are strongly skewed with larger positive values which may result in potentially important effects on air sea fluxes due to wave breaking globally the pdfs of the model solutions with and without cew combined with the empirical scaling of the rms differences could be used for stochastic analysis of the impacts of cew at global scales the relatively larger impact of cew on the energy dissipation and rate of air entrainment compared to the whitecap coverage besides the fact that they depend on different moments of λ is due to the additional nonlinear dependence on b k in eqs 18 and 9 taking the results in romero 2019 from idealized runs for developing waves with constant winds we find that v a w 1 25 and e d s w 1 66 these relationships exhibit substantial variability due to wave age that is not accounted for with these simple power laws nevertheless the exponents imply that the relative differences of v a and e d s due to cew compared to those of w would be 1 25 and 1 66 times larger respectively these factors are qualitatively consistent with the enhancement of rd rms in figs 10a and 12a b for v a and e d s compared to w the results showed that cew is significant for wave breaking at low winds 10 m s which is representative of global mean values semedo et al 2011 in fact the observed average wind speed over the ocean is about 7 m s freilich and challenor 1994 rodriguez 2018 several parameterizations in the literature of wave breaking and related air sea fluxes depend on wind speed or friction velocity and wave age or h s brumer et al 2017a b deike and melville 2018 reichl and deike 2020 but as shown here and by romero et al 2017 the wave breaking variability due to currents at scales of 1 km or smaller cannot be accounted for through h s instead a measure of the current gradients at scales of less than 1 km along with the friction velocity and mean wave period may lead to improved parameterizations of wave breaking and related air sea fluxes in the context of upper ocean processes the modeling study by gerbi et al 2013 investigated the effect of the turbulent kinetic energy flux induced by wave breaking on the dynamics of buoyant plumes their results show that wave breaking induced mixing results in deeper and narrower plumes with weaker vertical gradients of temperature and salinity affecting the plume evolution in that study wave breaking was parameterized as a function of the wind stress not accounting for cew as shown here the wave breaking is strongly modulated at submesoscales due to cew which may lead to nontrivial effects on the evolution and dynamics of fronts and plumes similarly the ocean side stress explicitly accounting wave breaking will be highly structured due to cew and correlated with submesoscale flow structures such as fronts filaments and eddies more generally heterogeneous wave fields due to cew will make heterogeneous wave effects on currents wec through stokes drift vertical mixing and surface stress moreover fully coupled ocean wave atmospheric models may also affect the eddy killer effect in which the feedback acts as a sink of energy in both the ocean and the atmosphere due to the coupling renault et al 2016 5 conclusions we presented a modeling study of current effects on waves with a realistic nested configuration in southern california at high resolutions 270 m l2 and 100 m l3 the analysis compared two one month long periods during the winter 2006 and spring 2007 with relatively active wave climates solutions without external forcing were used to assess model performance regarding the importance of the winds and currents particularly within sheltered areas wind forcing can significantly reduce model biases in the southern california bight particularly in the santa barbara channel in low wind conditions the significant wave height in the santa barbara channel can increase by up to 50 along the main coast of santa barbara and by up to 80 within the santa barbara channel due to current induced refraction in open ocean cew is most significant at low winds and increases with model resolution due to increased submesoscale activity l2 solutions forced by currents compared to those without in 10 m s winds give differences of 12 for h s surface stokes drift and mss and can reach 50 or more for the whitecap coverage w and the volume of entrained air v a and energy dissipation e d s by breaking waves for the higher resolution solution l3 these values become 15 and 70 or larger respectively cew on average increases the directional spreading by 0 9 0 2 with 3 variability and modulates the mean wave direction within 5 a statistical analysis of the model differences due to cew when normalized by the rms variability result in approximately self similar distributions independent of model resolution with h s well represented by the gaussian distribution stokes drift and mss symmetric with finite excess kurtosis and the wave breaking variables w v a and e d s positively skewed with finite excess kurtosis cew is stronger for the winter solution compared to the spring fig 13 an empirical scaling based on the rms current gradients air side friction velocity and mean wavelength explain most of the variability due to cew across the two seasons and the two model resolutions considered fig 13 with r 2 0 8 or larger except for h s with r 2 0 66 wavenumber spectra of model differences due to cew are proportional to the spectrum of the surface current magnitude however the difference spectrum for h s decreases faster with decreasing scale than the current spectrum for scales smaller than 1 km in contrast the surface stokes drift mss and wave breaking variables decay less steeply with decreasing scale than the current spectrum across the range of scales analyzed 10 s km to 100 s m with the largest variability compared to the current spectrum at small scales for the wave breaking variables considered namely whitecap coverage air entrainment rate and energy dissipation rate future work will characterize wave effects on currents wec due to both conservative and non conservative effects within the framework of mcwilliams et al 2004 and uchiyama et al 2010 with our testbed including higher resolutions better resolving nearshore processes other efforts will investigate the impact of wave current interactions on co 2 fluxes credit authorship contribution statement leonel romero conceptualization methodology validation

23957,understanding the governing mechanisms of atmosphere wave ocean interactions is critical for unravelling the formation and evolution mechanisms of severe weather phenomena this study aims at investigating the effects of atmosphere wave ocean feedbacks on a mediterranean tropical like cyclone medicane occurred on 27 30 september 2018 at the central eastern mediterranean sea and characterized by severe environmental and socioeconomic impact to unveil the interactions across the air sea interface the medicane was simulated by an integrated modelling system consisting of the chemical hydrological atmospheric ocean wave system chaos upgraded by embedding to it the nucleus for european modelling of the ocean nemo as ocean circulation component coupled simulations revealed that air seaheat transfer and ekman pumping bringing sub surface cold waters in upper ocean layers upwelling caused sst cooling 2 3 c sst cooling triggered a negative feedback loop procedure tending to balance between atmospheric and ocean processes it also attenuated the cyclone and subsequently reduced the atmospheric energy embedded in ocean through the upper ocean vertical stratification weakening thus upper ocean vertical mixing upwelling and sst cooling the waves adjusted this feedback loop making the system more resistant in air sea flux variations waves additionally weakened the cyclone not only due to the kinetic energy loss in the lower atmosphere but also due to the enhancement of sst cooling which is attributed to the strengthening of ekman pumping and vertical mixing forced by wind stress increase nevertheless waves partially balanced the air wave sea exchanges through the slight enthalpy flux gain under high wind conditions which is explained by considering the increase of enthalpy transfer coefficient in rougher sea areas keywords chaos system wrf wam nemo coupled models air sea interaction momentum enthalpy medicane 1 introduction ocean is a huge energy recipient and regulator transferring momentum and heat around the globe through the thermohaline circulation stewart 2008 the exchange of momentum heat water and turbulent kinetic energy between atmosphere and ocean determines weather and climate bao et al 2000 ličer et al 2016 von schuckmann 2016 döös et al 2017 akhtar et al 2018 renault et al 2019 strajnar et al 2019 ocean waves play the role of dynamical interface between ocean and atmosphere janssen et al 2013 pianezze et al 2018 lewis et al 2019 waves modify wind stress and turbulent heat fluxes kudryavtsev and makin 2007 liu et al 2011 wada et al 2014 while nonbreaking wave induced mixing in upper ocean may lead to enhanced sst cooling and deepening of the mixed layer aijaz et al 2017 due to the complexity of physical mechanisms there is the necessity for a detailed description and a holistic approach in numerical modelling of atmosphere wave ocean interactions warner et al 2010 carniel et al 2016 ricchi et al 2016 2017 lewis et al 2019 wu et al 2019 bender et al 1993 showed that the application of atmosphere ocean coupled models in the simulation of tropical cyclones led to sea surface cooling along their track which in turn created negative forcing on their development and intensity lionello et al 2003 and pianezze et al 2018 observed sea surface temperature sst cooling along the track of mediterranean cyclones in atmosphere wave ocean coupled simulations sst cooling is critical because the spatiotemporal variability of sst affects air sea fluxes and thus the dynamics of the planetary boundary layer pbl as mentioned by stocchi and davolio 2016 for heavy precipitation episodes in the mediterranean prakash et al 2018 estimated sst cooling about 0 5 c in the bay of bengal during a cyclone attributing it to upwelling processes and ekman transport in the ocean additionally the study of lee and chen 2012 for hurricane frances presented 0 58 c sst cooling that led to decrease in enthalpy flux by about 20 and 15 applying atmosphere ocean and atmosphere wave ocean coupling respectively moreover ricchi et al 2016 2017 confirmed that considering atmosphere wave ocean feedbacks contributes to a better description of sst cooling attributed to wave induced ocean mixing moreover rapidly generated wind waves can sharply increase sea surface roughness in contrast to low steepness swell attenuating wind and subsequently wave growth janssen 1989 1991 2004 jenkins et al 2012 varlas et al 2018 wiese et al 2019 evidenced that atmosphere wave coupling had a detectable imprint at the height of the pbl in a case study of a low pressure system in the north sea moreover wahle et al 2017 showed that the simulation of atmosphere wave interactions during severe weather conditions resulted in decreased wave heights and attenuated winds sauvage et al 2020 also showed that the atmosphere wave coupling caused reduction of wind and wave while modifying the positioning of convergence and the heaviest precipitation during a severe weather event furthermore rizza et al 2018 found that the representation of sea spray effects in air sea momentum exchange resulted in more realistic simulation of a mediterranean tropical like cyclone medicane pianezze et al 2018 evidenced an attenuation of bejisa cyclone in the indian ocean due to the increase of the wave induced sea surface roughness in another numerical study grifoll et al 2016 showed a relatively small relevance of air sea transfer considering the significant wave height swh in the sea surface roughness parameterization in addition ricchi et al 2017 2019 and rizza et al 2018 showed that there is a non negligible improvement in the simulation of mediterranean cyclones considering physically based sea surface roughness in coupled simulations carniel et al 2016 found that the representation of turbulent heat fluxes was improved using coupled modelling systems while garg et al 2018 showed that the latent and sensible heat fluxes were increased due to the wave induced sea surface roughness although there have been great efforts to dynamically simulate exchanges between ocean and atmosphere especially during cyclonic events e g olabarrieta et al 2012 mogensen et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 lengaigne et al 2018 miglietta and rotunno 2019 several uncertainties still exist hence especially under severe weather conditions it is imperative to shed new light on the implementation of integrated modelling systems better considering atmosphere wave ocean feedbacks as well as representing atmosphere and ocean as a dynamically coupled system akhtar et al 2014 byrne et al 2016 katsafados et al 2016 2017 in this line katsafados et al 2016 implemented the coupled system wew which explicitly resolved atmosphere wave interactions in the mediterranean sea achieving a more realistic representation of aerodynamic drag over rough sea surfaces consequently varlas 2017 implemented the chemical hydrological atmospheric ocean wave system chaos varlas et al 2018 assessed atmosphere wave interactions represented by chaos during the formation of a cyclone at the mediterranean sea they concluded that the wave induced sea surface roughness in the atmospheric surface layer modifies the air sea momentum enthalpy and moisture transfer having effects even on middle upper troposphere as well as on cloud formation and precipitation this study intends to investigate the impact of atmosphere wave ocean interactions on the evolution of a strong mediterranean tropical like cyclone medicane occurred on 27 30 september 2018 at the central eastern mediterranean sea inducing severe environmental and socioeconomic consequences it is important to note here that medicanes are very rare phenomena with a frequency of 1 5 per year romero and emanuel 2013 or 1 6 per year cavicchia et al 2014 due to the specific air sea processes favouring their formation therefore they are considered as identical cases to assess atmosphere wave ocean interactions under severe conditions in order to unravel the feedback processes across the air sea interface the medicane was simulated by an integrated modelling system comprising the chemical hydrological atmospheric ocean wave system chaos varlas 2017 varlas et al 2018 upgraded by introducing to it the nucleus for european modelling

evolution of the medicane finally section 5 contains a discussion of findings and the conclusions of this work 2 overview of chaos modelling system chaos was initially developed as a two way

introduction of nemo version 3 6 model in chaos system which was carried out after extensive efforts on the coupling between wrf and nemo as well as between wam and nemo through the oasis3 mct coupler it is important to note that in varlas et al 2019a as well as in this work wrf was upgraded to the recent version 4 0 skamarock et al 2008 powers et al 2017 re implementing the oasis3 mct coupling

chemistry wrf chem grell et al 2005 and hydrology wrf hydro gochis et al 2015 as described in varlas 2017 and varlas et al 2018 2019a 2020 however these sub components are not activated in this study 2 2 ocean wave component the ocean wave component was based on the cycle 4 5 4 of the wam model wamdi 1988 komen et al 1994 günther and behrens 2012 within the last three decades the wam model has become one of the most widely distributed and used models for operational wave prediction e g korres et al 2011 ravdas et al 2018 as well as for research purposes e g wahle et al 2017 katsafados et al 2016 2018 varlas et al 2018 2020 the wam solves the wave transport equation explicitly without any assumption on the shape of the wave spectrum it represents the physics of the wave evolution for the full set of degrees of freedom of a 2d wave spectrum moreover the model runs for any given regional or global grid with a prescribed bathymetric dataset and the grid resolution can be arbitrary in space and time 2 3 ocean circulation component the ocean circulation component was based on stable version 3 6 of the nemo model madec 2012 it is a primitive equation model adapted to regional and global ocean circulation studying the ocean and its interactions with the other components of the earth system over a wide range of spatiotemporal scales prognostic variables are the three dimensional velocity field a non linear sea surface height the conservative temperature and the absolute salinity projected onto an arakawa c type grid in this study we use also the nemo input output strategy connected to an external xml i o server i e xios in its version 2 0 under revision 1490 controlled by an xml extensible markup language file handling the i o specifications e g model variables and output frequencies a large number of numerical studies have been conducted using various configurations of nemo for the mediterranean sea like for instance the nemomed family from the french research community beuvier et al 2010 2012 and references within as well as the mediterranean forecasting system mfs from the italian research community oddo et al 2014 and references within recent studies have been also conducted with nemo using a regional configuration for the black sea cliberti et al 2018 gunduz et al 2020 2 4 coupler component the coupling of wrf wam and nemo models was based on oasis3 mct version 3 0 coupler valcke et al 2015 craig et al 2017 along with customized message passing interface mpi routines oasis3 mct is the state of the art of couplers with advanced capabilities in weather and climate modelling characterized by flexibility low intrusiveness portability and scalability valcke et al 2015 oasis3 mct is a coupling library to be linked to the component models supporting coupling procedures such as communication exchange and interpolation of fields in order for each component to be able to interact and exchange coupling fields with the other system components oasis3 mct interface must be implemented in its computational structure 2 5 coupling fields chaos modelling system was upgraded by coupling wrf and nemo as well as wam and nemo through the oasis3 mct coupler that enables the models to interact and exchange information fig 1 demonstrates the exchange of coupling fields among the components in more detail concerning the coupling between

atmospheric pressure at the sea surface p s f c estimated by wrf as far as the coupling of wrf and wam is concerned wrf receives the charnock parameter based on janssen s 1989 1991 quasi linear theory of wind wave generation see section 2 6 the significant wave height swh the wave age and the phase velocity at the peak of the wave spectrum v p h a s e estimated by wam while wam receives the u and v components of wind speed at 10 m u 10 and v 10 produced by wrf varlas 2017 varlas et al 2018 it is important to note that in this study among the parameters received by wrf only the charnock parameter following janssen s 1989 1991 theory is used in the atmospheric surface layer processes additional wave parameters estimated by wam and received by wrf could also be used in alternative estimations of the charnock parameter through wave age smith et al 1992 drennan et al 2005 liu et al 2011 as well as wave steepness taylor and yelland 2001 that is calculated using the significant wave height and the wavelength or via phase velocity at the peak of the wave spectrum the alternative estimations of the charnock parameter proposed by smith et al 1992 taylor and yelland 2001 drennan et al 2005 and liu et al 2011 have already been implemented in chaos as described in varlas 2017 but they are not presented in this study as regards the coupling of wam and nemo wam receives the u and v components of surface ocean current velocity u c u r and v c u r from nemo modifying wave refraction as described in ozer et al 2000 currently nemo does not receive wave parameters estimated by wam receives only implicit information through changes in the wind stress as estimated by wrf wam interaction but this is in the future plans of the authors more technical details about the coupling design and strategy as well as the timing of exchange procedure among chaos components can be found in appendix a 2 6 theoretical background of coupling procedure the dynamical and thermodynamic interactions among the lower atmosphere the ocean waves and the upper ocean determine the energy equilibria across air sea interface the momentum flux or kinematic stress τ and the enthalpy flux e which is the total of sensible h and latent l h heat fluxes are the most essential parameters for analysing air sea transfer processes varlas et al 2018 wrf model estimates these parameters over the sea as follows fairall

standard level in the lower atmosphere c d c h and c q are the dimensionless bulk transfer coefficients for momentum sensible heat and moisture respectively while c k is the respective coefficient for enthalpy furthermore as noted by varlas 2017 we can consider c k c q c h when neglecting sea spray flux in the interfacial atmosphere ocean exchange green and zhang 2013 roughness length z 0 over the sea is estimated in the surface layer parameterization of the wrf model through the eq 2 5 using the charnock 1955 equation as first term z c and a second term for viscous sublayer z v near the sea

air kinematic viscosity and a is the charnock parameter the charnock parameter represents the sea state impact on the lowest part of the atmosphere affecting the surface layer processes katsafados et al 2016 in chaos the charnock parameter can be online estimated by wam incorporating information for the sea state in the surface layer parameterization of wrf following janssen s 1989 1991 quasi linear theory of wind wave generation according to janssen 1989 1991 2004 the charnock parameter depends on sea state through the ratio between the wave induced stress τ w and the sum of the wave induced stress and the turbulent stress neglecting the viscous stress namely total stress τ as follows 2 6 α 0 01 1 τ w τ more details for the estimation of wave induced charnock parameter in chaos can be found in varlas 2017 and varlas et al 2018 as far as the nemo ocean model is concerned we briefly recapitulate its primitive equations in order to highlight the physics controlled by variables

a strong slip option 3 experimental setup 3 1 case study medicane 27 30 september 2018 chaos after its major upgrade with nemo was assessed simulating the medicane occurred on 27 30 september 2018 at the central eastern mediterranean sea and initially formed on 27 september 2018 at the northeastern coast of libya the medicane begun to rapidly deepen on 27 september at 18 00 utc fig 2a according to the analysis of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf the cyclonic system formed under the support of a cold cut off upper air trough portmann et al 2019 and high ssts locally exceeding even 25 26 c as will be shown in following section at this area the cut off trough originated from the continental europe fed the northwestern parts of the cyclone with cold upper air masses accompanied by low geopotential heights and positive vorticity not shown triggering its intensification the role of cut off trough was important to the formation of such an intense tropical like cyclone the trough gradually circled the cyclone forcing it to stay almost stagnant over the southern ionian sea the cold upper air intrusion in combination with the significant amount of trapped heat and moisture in the lower troposphere and the weak vertical shear drove to significant vertical instability and deep convection favouring the gradual transition to a tropical like cyclone it is important to note here that the medicane continued to intensify despite the colder ssts ranging from 21 to 24 c existing along its northward trajectory this is a critical difference generally observed between medicanes and tropical cyclones which are developed only over warm seas 26 c as noted by tous and romero 2013 the explanation for this behaviour is the existence of upper air induced baroclinic environment during the development of medicanes in contrast to tropical cyclones that are much more dependent on high ssts as warmer tropics are free of baroclinic influences tous and romero 2013 therefore the sea atmosphere thermodynamical disequilibrium in mediterranean basin supports the development of tropical like cyclones at much lower ssts comparing with the tropics tous and romero 2013 on 28 september at 12 00 utc the cyclonic system seems strong with compact vertical structure characterized by warm seclusion and tropical like properties as evidenced by the high 500 hpa temperatures in the medicane s core fig 2b the tropical like phase of the medicane was also characterized by a small circular eye surrounded by an eyewall and an approximately axisymmetric pattern of deep convective clouds spinning around the eye fig 2c the important role of upper air conditions such as cut off troughs in the formation of medicanes as well as their characteristics such as the warm core the small eye and the eyewall circled by deep convective clouds are also noted by several relevant studies e g pytharoulis et al 2000 fita et al 2007 moscatello et al 2008 miglietta et al 2011 tous et al 2013 pytharoulis 2018 miglietta and rotunno 2019 noyelle et al 2019 the fact that the cyclone caused gale force winds and high waves as well as it remained for almost 36 h over the southern ionian sea makes it an ideal case study to assess chaos sensitivity on dynamical lower boundary conditions posed by the nemo model before dissipating over the regional greece and partly over the aegean sea from 29 september at 12 00 utc to 30 september at 18 00 utc the medicane made landfall at southwestern coast of peloponnese greece on 29 september at 09 15 utc according to a meteosat 11 visible image fig 2d the medicane was related to 3 deaths in greece having a severe environmental and socioeconomic impact while also affected libya tunisia and turkey 3 2 chaos configuration in order to simulate the lifecycle of the medicane over the open sea until its landfall at the southwestern greece chaos was configured to perform 48 h sensitivity tests in the period from 27 september at 12 00 utc to 29 september at 12 00 utc chaos components were set up on domains covering the mediterranean and black seas as depicted on fig 3a the northwestern corner of nemo domain is out of the wrf domain but it does not affect the simulations because the bay of biscay is masked as land more details are presented in the following sub section 3 3 atmospheric component setup the atmospheric component of chaos had a grid spacing of 9 km 9 km with 600 310 c grid points timestep of 30 s and 33 vertical levels stretching from the surface up to 50 hpa and covered the mediterranean sea part of north africa and most of europe fig 3a gridded analysis data from ecmwf on a horizontal resolution of 0 1 0 1 and a time increment of 6 h were used for the creation of initial and boundary conditions of the atmospheric component as far as the parameterizations of atmospheric mechanisms are concerned the revised monin obukhov scheme jiménez et al 2012 was used to simulate the processes in the surface layer comprising several modifications to encapsulate sea state information as described in varlas 2017 and varlas et al 2018 it is important to note that dissipative heating effect was also activated in the surface layer processes for enhancing sensible heat flux this effect was also taken into consideration by katsafados et al 2018 in a chaos simulation of hurricane sandy 2012 at the atlantic ocean because it is critical in the cases of severe cyclonic systems planetary boundary layer pbl processes were resolved by the yonsei university scheme hong et al 2006 ysu the ground processes were simulated using the unified land surface model tewari et al 2004 unified noah in order to resolve the long wave and short wave radiation processes the rrtmg iacono et al 2008 was used thompson scheme was applied for the cloud microphysics thompson et al 2008 and the grell freitas ensemble scheme grell and freitas 2014 was used for the convective processes moreover the global multi resolution terrain elevation data gmted 2010 30 arc sec usgs danielson and gesch 2011 the modis fpar vegetation data myneni et al 2002 and the 21 class igbp modis land use data friedl et al 2010 were employed as static input data of the model the over sea lower boundary conditions of wrf sst as well as u and v components of current velocity were provided by nemo while charnock was based on wam it is important to note that null current values sst analysis data provided by the copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems and charnock parameter equal to 0 0185 as also used by varlas et al 2018 were set as constant lower boundary conditions for areas of wrf domain outside the nemo and wam domains respectively to reduce erroneously values at the transition zone of the different model domains an algorithm was designed to apply a 1 2 1 smoothing filter along models boundaries 3 4 wave component setup concerning the wam model setup the grid covered the geographical area 8 w to 42 e and 29 n to 48 n as shown in fig 3a red line using a resolution of 0 1 0 1 with 501 191 regular lat lon points wam had a propagation timestep of 72 s and a source timestep of 720 s 12 min moreover wam used 24 directional bins 15 directional resolution and 25 frequency bins ranging from 0 042 to 0 411 hz to represent the wave spectra distribution wam also used bathymetric data based on etopo1 dataset amante and eakins 2009 1 min gridded global relief data the input bathymetric data was constructed applying bi linear interpolation and some degree of smoothing while local corrections were introduced in shallow areas of mediterranean and black sea basins fig 3b furthermore shallow water approximation including depth refraction and depth induced wave breaking battjes and janssen 1978 was employed due to the complex bathymetry of the mediterranean and black seas the shallow water approximation represents the wave energy loss due to bottom friction and percolation and it is preferred for high resolution simulations e g monbaliu et al 2010 korres et al 2011 it is important to note here that the western boundaries of the domain in the atlantic ocean were considered as closed without using lateral boundary conditions from global wave models or analysis data in addition as proposed by katsafados et al 2016 the gibraltar the dardanelles and the bosporus straits were also considered to be closed boundaries therefore wave energy was prevented to be advected through these channels moreover wam was set up to be initialized using the hot start approach see günther and behrens 2012 based on a 1 day spin up simulation in order to obtain a realistic initial wave spectrum similar initialization approach for wam was also followed by varlas et al 2018 3 5 ocean circulation component setup as regards the model setup to simulate the oceanic circulation a nemo based regional configuration was used covering the mediterranean and black seas 9 w to 42 6 e and 30 n to 50 3 n as shown in fig 3a blue line explicitly connected through the marmara sea from the dardanelles and bosporus straits using a strong slip option for the tangential velocity at the coast near the straits fig 3c the bay of biscay and the sea of azov in the northwestern and northeastern corners were masked as land grid points the primitive equations were discretized on a 1 12 curvilinear arakawa c grid 7 9 km at mid latitudes 609 320 grid points assuming hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations based on the orca tripolar grid barnier et al 2006 at this resolution the ocean model is eddy permitting resolving one to two rossby radii of deformation in the mediterranean sea beuvier et al 2012 the regional domain hereafter medx12 x stands for an extended mediterranean configuration including the black sea was extracted with the siren tool as an exact 1 1 subset of the global operational system psy4v3r1 http marine copernicus eu the vertical discretization had 50 z levels with partial steps to allow for an accurate representation of the seabed the system had 1 m resolution at the surface decreasing to 450 m at the bottom with 22 levels in the upper 100 m the bathymetry was a merge of etopo1 amante and eakins 2009 over the mediterranean sea and gebco 2014 weatherall et al 2015 datasets over the black sea the minimum depth was set at 12 m and therefore the upper layers had 9 wet levels we note that the projection of the bathymetric data on both ocean and wave model domains is expected to be different since they have different resolutions map projections land sea masks open boundaries and model physics constraints to name but a few the medx12 grid set up based on the parent system psy4v3r1 simplifies and increases the robustness of the nesting procedure using as initial and open boundary conditions the prescribed 3d analysis fields of the full ocean state vector ssh t s u v from the daily archives of cmems http marine copernicus eu the western boundary of the ocean model was set in the atlantic ocean at 9 w including a buffer zone of approximately 1 a strong damping for the tracers and the baroclinic velocities was applied in the buffer zone with a restoring timescale set at 1 day a split explicit free surface time splitting scheme was used to simulate properly fast external gravity waves shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the model simulated tides and the inverse barometer ib effect and included their fast components in the open boundary the flather 1994 scheme was imposed as a radiation condition to add the tidal harmonic forcing in the open boundary the tidal components were provided by the tpxo7 2 global model of ocean tides egbert and erofeeva 2002 as the sum of 11 constituents m2 s2 k2 n2 k1 o1 p1 q1 m4 mf mm the ib was added in the open boundary to account for the sea level response to pressure variations a barotropic short timestep was set at 17 s and a costlier baroclinic update of the depth varying prognostic variables was set at 240 s once in production the model is stable with a less costly baroclinic timestep e g 480 s however the former choice ensures the robustness of the tri coupled system initialized from the 3d analysis fields of the full ocean state vector climatological monthly values of flow rates were prescribed for six major rivers in the mediterranean sea i e ebro rhone po from grdc 2014 and axios evros nile after the aswan dam from vervatis et al 2013 and references within and five major rivers in the black sea i e danube dnieper dniester rioni kizilirmak from grdc 2014 fig 3c represented by red dots the rivers were imposed as a surface boundary freshwater flux of constant salinity 0 1 enhanced vertical diffusion at the river mouths with mixing coefficient 10 3 m2 s 1 was applied to mix the freshwater over the top 12 m of the water column 3 6 ocean circulation component spin up in order to develop coherent structures and represent the main physical processes for the upper ocean in the mediterranean and black seas we have performed a 2 month spin up simulation of the ocean model in offline mode nemo was initialized on 1 august 2018 at 00 00 utc using the cmems 3d analysis fields of the full ocean state vector ssh t s u v boundary conditions were provided by the daily archives of cmems and the flux fields from a series of chaos uncoupled simulations more specifically chaos was set up to perform continuous 36 h simulations providing the necessary hourly flux fields for nemo it is noteworthy that the regional model medx12 and the operational system psy4v3r1 provides the restart and boundary analysis fields http marine copernicus eu share the same grids and resolution but have different model setup in terms of physics and forcing e g tides inverse barometer therefore we argue that the 2 month free run is adequate to capture the intra seasonal variability of the upper ocean water column structure important for the test case presented in this study whilst the intermediate and deep layers are close to the analysis fields longer simulations resolving the overturning circulation of the mediterranean sea were deemed as out of scope for the present work and in addition would compromise the performance of the system for this extreme weather event under investigation deviating from analysis i e no data assimilation and no relaxation restoring terms the output from the 2 month simulation of nemo was used as the sea state initial condition for all sensitivity simulations performed in this work 3 7 design of sensitivity simulations the upgraded version of chaos offers the capability to represent atmosphere wave ocean interactions this is based on the online exchange of information among the components using the oasis3 mct coupler it is important to note that wrf was initialized with the sst produced by the spin up nemo simulation instead of cmems analysis data for 27 september for assuring the consistency of initial and nemo based ssts throughout all the simulations the initial sst field was a synthesis of the sst output of the spin up nemo simulation and the cmems based sst outside the nemo domain using 1 2 1 smoothing at the domain borders fig 4 shows the sst field used in the initialization of the wrf simulations moreover the initialization of all the coupling fields was based on the results of the wrf nemo and wrf wam spin up simulations for 27 september at 12 00 utc in this way wrf wam and nemo were initialized on 27 september at 12 00 utc using the same physically generated coupling fields in the three sensitivity simulations avoiding inconsistent values in the initialization in order to analyse the two way feedbacks in each interaction as well as to assess the sensitivity of the system three simulation approaches were conducted following different coupling strategy among the chaos components therefore the sensitivity tests were based on the following chaos numerical experiments 1 way wrf was one way coupled with nemo and wam through the oasis3 mct coupler wrf online provided the necessary coupling fields to nemo and wam models every 1 h but did not get any feedback from nemo and wam therefore wrf used constant sst equal to initial resulted by the spin up nemo simulation and constant charnock 0 0185 fields throughout the simulation meanwhile wam ran with null currents since there was no communication with nemo this methodological approach is common and is used in uncoupled offline systems 2 way wrf and nemo models were two way coupled while wrf and wam models were one way coupled through the oasis3 mct coupler wrf and nemo were set to exchange information every 4 min while wrf and wam every 12 min hence wrf got feedback from nemo but it did not get wave information from wam moreover nemo and wam did not interact 3 way wrf was two way coupled with nemo and with wam while nemo and wam were 1 way coupled through the oasis3 mct coupler fig 1 therefore this simulation mode can be considered that represents 3 way atmosphere wave ocean coupling wrf nemo and wrf wam exchange times were the same as in the 2 way configuration while nemo and wam exchanged information every 12 min i e wam received ocean surface currents from nemo thus nemo did not directly get wave information from wam but only indirectly through the impact of wave stress on the lower atmospheric processes resolved by wrf and subsequently on wrf estimated atmospheric fluxes imposed on ocean 4 atmosphere wave ocean dynamical assessment the results derived from the three simulations were merged in the same figures in order to practically assess the atmosphere wave ocean interactions in this way factors that determine the formation of the cyclone as well as feedbacks between lower atmosphere waves and upper ocean can be properly traced we have emphasized on 28 september 2018 when the cyclone remained almost stagnant over the southern ionian sea 4 1 upper ocean dynamical assessment here we focus on the dynamical aspects of the cyclone altering the upper water column structure as well as we compare the sensitivity simulations showcasing their differences the sst cooling over the ionian sea during the period of the lifecycle of the medicane over the open sea until its landfall was at about 1 56 0 21 c 1 28 0 18 c and 1 35 0 18 c for the 1 way 2 way and 3 way simulations respectively in fig 5 we illustrate the ekman and mixed layer dynamics induced by the intensity of the medicane the complexity introduced by different interaction processes in the three simulations and some local aspects in the ionian sea due to the different positioning of the cyclone in the three simulations the remote impact of the system in adjacent seas was also noticeable but a detailed analysis is out of scope in this work as will be shown in a similar analysis for the atmospheric and ocean wave parameters in the following sections the wind stress of the cyclone in the 3 way simulation was controlled by feedback mechanisms with its south southwest side enhanced on 28 september 2018 at 12 00 utc fig 5a the intensity of the cyclone had a significant impact on the properties of the water column an increase in the wind stress enhanced the ocean vertical mixing exhibiting similar patterns fig 5b and in turn increased the ekman layer and the mld fig 5c the cyclone s wind stress relative vorticity was highly increased in the area expressed by the vector τ f with positive values reaching up to 0 6 n m 3 s leading to open ocean upwelling as a result of ekman pumping and subsequently decreasing sst fig 5d the heat fluxes also contributed to the weakening of the ocean stratification through buoyancy loss mainly observed on the south southwest side of the cyclone where the net downward heat flux at the sea surface exceeded a loss for the ocean about 200 w m 2 fig 5e we investigate the increasing complexity of the coupling modes between the chaos components controlling the atmosphere wave ocean feedbacks for the sake of clarity we state that the cyclone was not dynamically controlled by the ocean state in the 1 way simulation since 1 the sst was imposed on wrf as static field taken from initial conditions whereas in nemo the sst was dynamically computed 2 the surface ocean currents were taken as null fields and 3 charnock was considered by wrf as constant 0 0185 field as a first step we examine the differences in nemo results between the two simulations 2 way minus 1 way to isolate the impact of the air seainteraction fig 5k o the cyclone s intensity in the 2 way experiment was on average decreased over the ionian sea compared with the 1 way and this was also reflected on the wind stress fig 5k since the wind velocities were reduced the positive negative wind stress filaments in fig 5k are attributed to the different positioning of the cyclone between the two experiments in the same line of thinking the decrease in the wind stress had a direct impact on increasing the upper ocean stratification fig 5l due to reduced ekman dynamics their patterns are shown to be similar i e fig 5k l followed also by a decrease in mld but with more noisy patterns controlled by additional processes fig 5m as a result the open ocean upwelling estimated by nemo was reduced in the 2 way simulation and the sst was increased almost everywhere in the ionian sea locally exceeding 0 5 c compared with the nemo estimated sst evolving in time in the 1 way experiment fig 5n characterized by more intense upwelling in addition this comparison shows that the heat fluxes contributed to lowering the sst since the turbulent heat loss fluxes from the ocean to the atmosphere were larger in the nemo 1 way simulation sustained by a more intense cyclone compared with the 2 way run this increase of heat loss in the 1 way simulation exceeded 200 w m 2 and 50 w m 2 for the ocean locally and on average for the whole ionian sea respectively we now consider the difference between the 3 way and 2 way simulations i e 3 way minus 2 way in the 3 way simulation the cyclone s intensity was reduced compared with the simpler 2 way coupling and their differences were minor in fig 5j the difference of the heat fluxes between the coupled simulations was on average zero estimated by the hourly fields and depicted by positive negative filament patterns in the area spanned by the cyclone according to this the changes observed between the experiments can be linked to the momentum fluxes imposed implicitly by the wave model through the wind stress to the ocean state we also note that in 3 way coupling mode both wrf and wam simulated less intense wind wave fields among all experiments as it will be shown in the following sections however the wind stress and subsequently the ocean vertical mixing and the mld were notably increased the latter being driven by ekman dynamics fig 5f h in this context the most prominent feature is the decrease of the sst locally reaching 0 5 c fig 5i as a result of induced open ocean upwelling additional thermodynamic processes e g based on the enthalpy flux for the sst decrease in the 3 way coupling are discussed in following sections overall we found that the impact of the ocean state on the atmospheric system can be reversed from being negative to positive feedback depending on whether the ocean wave model is coupled or not the ocean model was compared with the ostia dataset during the period of the medicane as well as for the whole spin up period the sst l4 cmems product corresponds to daily gridded optimally interpolated gap free satellite estimates at 1 16 high resolution in order to evaluate the cyclone s impact we focus our investigation over the ionian sea fig 6 presents the taylor diagram taylor 2001 comparing the ocean model sst for the simulation experiments against the ostia data by means of standard deviation centred root mean square difference rmsd and correlation the quantitative metrics confirm that all model simulations were skillful in estimating the sst shown to be well correlated with the observations the rmsd and standard deviation metrics are kept within an acceptable range of sst values pertaining to the fact that the accuracy of the ostia sst system against in situ observations is occasionally higher than 0 5 k rmsd donlon et al 2012 although the correlation is a bit stronger for the sensitivity simulations compared to spin up the rmsd and standard deviation metrics slightly degrade mainly because of two reasons a the spin up run is closer to the analysis fields used to initialize the model on 1 august 2018 at 00 00 utc and b the ostia sst analysis error is larger during the period of the cyclone simulations due to gaps in the l3 data prior to oi overall there is a small but marked increase in the skill metrics between the three cyclone experiments with the 3 way simulation being the most skillful in a similar vein we compare the model s upper ocean water column structure between the three cyclone experiments against the in situ observations retrieved from the only available argo float in the area during the event fig 7 in this area under the impact of the cyclone the ocean model is shown to enhance upper ocean cooling as the event progresses we note that the cooling is smaller in the 3 way and 2 way simulations whilst overestimates vertical mixing in the upper 40 m depth on the other hand the model is shown to be skillful in estimating the thermocline depth as well as the potential temperature at intermediate layers 4 2 effects on air sea momentum flux the analysis of momentum flux is also presented for 28 september 2018 at 12 00 utc when the medicane covered widespread open sea area in the southern ionian sea in response to rough sea areas with high roughness length z 0 at the southward of the medicane s eye fig 8a the air sea momentum flux reached 2 n m 2 in the 3 way simulation fig 8b the gale force westerly winds at this area of eyewall resulted in rapidly generated waves that increased sea surface roughness the role of high frequency wind generated waves on roughness increase was also highlighted by jenkins et al 2012 and varlas et al 2018 nevertheless as shown in fig 8 c the maximum of significant wave height exceeding 6 m was presented at the northwestern of the cyclone this is attributed to the trajectory of the system which was moving northwestward building up higher waves fig 8 d f shows the differences 3 way minus 2 way while fig 8 g i the differences 2 way minus 1 way for roughness length air sea momentum flux and swh respectively in contrast to 2 way simulation 3 way is characterized by higher roughness length fig 8d due to the introduction of sea state dependent stress in the atmospheric surface layer processes this resulted in increase of momentum flux from the lower layers of atmosphere to the sea fig 8e and led to loss of atmospheric kinetic energy and reduction of swh fig 8f similar results were presented by wahle et al 2017 and varlas et al 2018 on the other hand comparing 2 way and 1 way simulations 2 way demonstrates a decrease in momentum flux and swh however roughness length is almost unaffected fig 8g i such response is attributed to the air sea enthalpy flux in 2 way experiment that was forced by the introduction of the nemo model resulting in sst cooling as analysed in the previous section fig 9 a c depicts the effects on surface momentum flux for the period from 27 september at 18 00 utc to 29 september at 12 00 utc 2018 as regards the areas affected by the cyclone comparing to the 1 way and 2 way simulations the increase of roughness length in the 3 way simulation resulted in an increase of the c d drag coefficient and subsequently of the momentum flux another interesting remark in fig 9 is that roughness length drag coefficient and momentum flux are shown to have large spread with the wind speed compared with the 1 way and 2 way simulations the latter indicates that the wave coupling greatly alters the cyclone s properties for instance the maximum values of the wind speed are reduced but the momentum fluxes are distributed on a wider range of the energy spectrum this fact highlights the highly non linear character of the wave coupling influencing the evolution of the cyclone 4 3 effects on air sea enthalpy flux continuing the analysis for 28 september 2018 at 12 00 utc air sea enthalpy flux exceeded 800 w m 2 in the 3 way simulation fig 10c reaching a maximum of 891 w m 2 collocating with wind fig 10a and sst fig 10b maxima of 14 m s 1 and 25 c respectively it is important to note that surface enthalpy flux was lower in the eyewall of the medicane characterized by winds exceeding 22 m s 1 and sst ranging from 22 c to 24 c than the southwestern areas with weaker winds and higher ssts fig 10a c this is attributed to the dependence of enthalpy flux not only on wind speed but also on sea air temperature difference see eq 4 the latter term is expected to be larger at the southwestern areas because wind originated from areas over fresh water masses moves to areas over warmer waters while also accelerates over strong gradients of sst e g o neill et al 2010 this phenomenon increases sea air temperature difference feeding the southwestern parts of the medicane with significant amounts of enthalpy while defines the sustained winds through the sst induced modification of surface vorticity and divergence e g chelton et al 2007 o neill et al 2010 this also highlights the importance of sst and its gradients in the ocean to atmosphere heat transfer during the formation of cyclonic systems as also discussed by varlas et al 2019b c fig 10 d f demonstrates the differences 3 way minus 2 way while fig 10 g i the differences 2 way minus 1 way for wind speed sst and air sea enthalpy flux respectively at this point we ought to state again that those are the fields seen by wrf i e imposed to or estimated by wrf in particular for the 1 way experiment the sst used during the whole cyclone simulation is the one used as an initial condition on 27 september 2018 at 12 00 utc therefore the comparison between 2 way and 1 way simulations indicates sst cooling fig 10h as opposed to fig 5n depicting nemo estimated sst evolving in time in 1 way simulation sst cooling reached 2 3 c and weakened enthalpy flux fig 10i attenuating cyclone s sustained winds fig 10g comparing 3 way and 2 way 3 way run resulted in attenuated lower atmospheric flow as discussed in the previous section despite the appearance of some local maxima minima in the wind field fig 10d which can be explained by the differences in the simulated medicane s track despite the attenuation of winds in 3 way run the increase of sea surface roughness strengthened wind stress which subsequently drove to enhanced upwelling in the upper ocean slightly reducing sst but locally increasing enthalpy flux fig 10e f the increase of enthalpy flux is explained by the dependence of the c k enthalpy transfer coefficient on the sea surface roughness as also noted by varlas et al 2018 fig 11a reveals that c k is more scattered in the 3 way simulation exceeding 1 way and 2 way values especially under high winds this behaviour in 3 way run is attributed to the increase of sea surface roughness due to wave stress having a positive impact on c k enthalpy transfer coefficient and thus preserving the enthalpy flux in considerable levels even under wind attenuation fig 11b and sst cooling fig 11c conditions hence the role of waves on the feedback loops among atmosphere waves and upper ocean is to make the system more resistant in air sea flux variabilities waves weakened the cyclone due to momentum flux but strengthened it through the increase of c k partially balancing the upper ocean negative feedback in a more realistic way focusing on the role of sea state on c k and c d coefficients can unveil the negative impact of sea state dependent charnock parameter on the medicane s energy balance in particular fig 11d illustrates the c k c d ratio which is used as an indicator of the energy equilibrium that determines the structure and intensity of tropical cyclones e g emanuel 1995 the c k c d ratio is more scattered in the 3 way coupled simulation indicating the regulating role of the spatially varying charnock on the momentum and enthalpy transfer coefficients it is meaningful to note that in the 3 way coupled simulation a decrease of the ratio is presented in moderate and high wind speeds indicating that the energy loss due to the momentum transferred to waves exceeded the enthalpy gain of lower atmospheric layers therefore this equilibrium caused a reduction of the medicane s energy content having also a negative effect on its development 4 4 impact on track and precipitation fig 12a illustrates the track of the medicane from 27 september at 12 00 utc to 29 september at 12 00 utc as simulated by the 1 way 2 way and 3 way experiments and also analysed by the ecmwf fig 12a also shows the minima of mean sea level pressure mslp every 6 h based on the simulation results and the ecmwf analyses the same figure also presents near landfall measurements of a nearby surface meteorological station at geraki and the buoy 68422 located offshore of pylos peloponnese the measured mslp values did not refer to the same locations of simulated and analysed mslp maxima so they only offered valuable information about mslp during landfall but they were not be used for evaluation of simulations the impact of 2 way and 3 way coupling on air sea momentum and enthalpy exchange was reflected on the evolution and the track of the medicane the estimated geometric distance between the tracks based on the ecmwf analyses and the three experiments ranged from 2 to 60 km the estimated average distances for 3 way 2 way and 1 way simulations were 27 km 30 km and 29 km respectively despite the small differences among the simulations the 3 way experiment improved the representation of medicane s trajectory presenting slightly smaller average distance in comparison with the two other simulations furthermore fig 12b demonstrates timeseries of mslp minima and sustained wind speed maxima from 27 september at 12 00 utc to 29 september at 12 00 utc for the three simulation every 1 h and for ecmwf analyses every 6 h it is meaningful to note that the 2 way and more the 3 way coupling drove to the simulation of shallower weaker medicane comparing with the results of the 1 way experiment as illustrated in fig 12b the shallowing impact of 2 way and 3 way coupling was reflected on mslp even exceeding 4 hpa difference in comparison with 1 way while the negative effect of 3 way coupling on the intensity of the sustained winds reached approximately 9 m s 1 besides the 1 way simulation 2 way and 3 way increased mslp per 3 3 hpa on 29 september at 00 00 utc and 3 9 hpa at 06 00 utc respectively improving the agreement with the ecmwf analyses and the measurements table 1 these findings reveal the importance of atmosphere wave ocean feedbacks in the simulation of the medicane and its properties such as mslp and sustained winds it is essential to note here that the results and measurements presented in table 1 refer to different locations in order to avoid inaccuracies due to track and phase variations in the medicane simulations this study does not aim to a thorough statistical assessment of chaos e g varlas et al 2020 so we do not use strict evaluation techniques for mslp in this way we can unveil the impact of coupling approaches on the dynamic evolution of the cyclone simply comparing with the near real state evidenced by the ecmwf analyses and the measurements presented in fig 12a moreover improvements are also evidenced for wind speed and swh estimation comparing with measurements in this comparison we extracted the model values in the locations of the measurements adopting a nearest neighbour interpolation approach varlas et al 2018 according to the measurements of buoy 68422 on 29 september at 06 00 utc wind speed reached 16 2 m s 1 while 1 way 2 way and 3 way simulations resulted in wind speed equal to 22 4 m s 1 20 2 m s 1 and 17 6 m s 1 respectively as far as the swh is concerned the buoy measured 4 8 m at the same time while 1 way 2 way and 3 way simulations resulted in 5 9 m 5 1 m and 4 9 m respectively the overall attenuation of the cyclone in both 2 way and 3 way simulations resulted in reduction of total accumulated precipitation during the 42 h period from 27 september at 18 00 utc to 29 september at 12 00 utc fig 13a c the decrease observed in the precipitation in 2 way fig 13b and 3 way fig 13c simulations compared to 1 way fig 13a seems to agree with the measurements of the meteorological station at geraki for the same period geraki station measured accumulated precipitation equal to 41 2 mm while 1 way 2 way and 3 way estimated 124 mm 79 4 mm and 73 4 mm respectively the highest improvements for 3 way and 2 way were achieved in 6 h periods from 12 00 utc to 18 00 utc on 28 september with 34 4 mm 30 6 mm 17 8 mm and 14 4 mm for 1 way 2 way 3 way and measured respectively as well as from 06 00 utc to 12 00 utc on 29 september with 79 mm 32 9 mm 45 6 mm and 11 4 mm respectively the encouraging results of the comparison among the simulations highlight the advantages of the more complex coupling mechanisms of the 2 way and 3 way simulation resulting in more realistic simulation of the medicane s formation 5 discussion and conclusions this study presented the investigation of the influence ofatmosphere wave ocean feedbacks on a medicane 27 30 september 2018 at the central eastern mediterranean sea characterized by severe environmental and socioeconomic effects to this end a major upgrade of the chemical hydrological atmospheric ocean wave system chaos system was performed embedding to it the nucleus for european modelling of the ocean nemo as ocean circulation component the introduction of nemo in chaos made feasible the ingestion of physically based sea surface temperature and currents as dynamical lower boundary forcing in atmospheric modelling as well as sea surface current information in wave refraction modelling three simulation approaches following different coupling strategy among the chaos components were designed 1 way wrf was one way coupled with nemo and wam through the oasis3 mct coupler 2 way wrf and nemo models were two way coupled while wrf and wam models were one way coupled through the oasis3 mct coupler and 3 way wrf was two way coupled with nemo and wam while nemo and wam were one way coupled through the oasis3 mct coupler we note that in the 3 way simulation wam receives nemo surface currents but nemo receives only implicit information from wam through changes in the wind stress estimated by wrf wam interaction physical interactions considered in the upgraded chaos weremainly driven by the enthalpy and momentum exchanges in theatmosphere wave ocean system considering the effects of resolvedocean circulation and wave generation on atmospheric processes and consequently their feedbacks to wave and upper ocean mechanisms as regards the atmospheric response sst cooling locally up to 2 3 c in 2 way simulation did not allow the medicane to be fed with enough heat so it was weaker than in the 1 way simulation the representation of sst cooling and its effects comes to an agreement with bender et al 1993 lionello et al 2003 and pianezze et al 2018 who reached similar results along the track of cyclones the sst cooling initiated a negative feedback loop mechanism tending to an equilibrium between atmospheric and ocean processes sst cooling weakened the cyclone and attenuated the atmospheric energy embedded in ocean through upper ocean vertical stratification weakening thus upper ocean vertical mixing upwelling and subsequently sst cooling in the 3 way coupling the introduction of wave induced stress in the atmospheric surface layer processes increased the momentum flux to the ocean surface and as a result the medicane lost kinetic energy nevertheless wave induced stress caused a slight increase of enthalpy flux under high winds due to the increase of enthalpy transfer coefficient c k which is dependent on sea surface roughness length z 0 the latter effect partially balanced the air wave sea exchanges in a more realistic way therefore the role of waves on the air wave sea feedback loop was to make the system more resilient in the variabilities of fluxes between the two fluid mediums it is also noteworthy that a wave induced reduction of the c k c d ratio was evidenced in moderate and high wind intensities in the 3 way coupled simulation revealing that the energy loss due to the momentum transferred to waves exceeded the enthalpy gain of lower atmospheric layers this balance indicates a wave induced negative effect of 3 way coupling on the energy content and the development of the medicane moreover in the 3 way coupled simulation wave induced stress enhanced ekman pumping and sst cooling through the modification of wind stress estimated by the atmospheric component and transferred to the ocean circulation component imposing momentum flux in the upper ocean layer increasing vertical mixing it is noteworthy that the 2 way and more the 3 way simulations simulated a less intense system by increasing its minimum mslp and reducing wind speed while 3 way slightly improved its track this finding is in accordance with wahle et al 2017 who also observed similar effects in 2 way atmosphere wave simulations as far as precipitation is concerned the overall attenuation of the cyclone strength in both 2 way and 3 way simulations resulted in the reduction of total accumulated precipitation during the lifecycle of the medicane above open sea the attenuation of the system in 2 way and 3 way simulations is attributed to the impact of coupling complexity on the surface enthalpy and momentum fluxes which is feasible only considering contrary air wave sea feedbacks as far as the innovative features of this work are concerned it is meaningful to note that this coupled modelling study is the first combining wrf wam nemo models running in this sequence considering atmosphere wave ocean feedbacks at the mediterranean and black seas moreover the nemo and wam models apply many physics packages and parameterizations different from those used by other coupled models such as for instance the regional ocean modelling system roms and the simulating waves nearshore swan wave model which are incorporated in the coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport coawst modelling system warner et al 2010 applied in the mediterranean basin e g ricchi et al 2016 2017 from scientific methodological perspective it is fairly important to perform similar experiments with different tools to ensure the generalization of the results and their validity as well moreover this study also presents the novel incorporation of an oceanographic model for the mediterranean explicitly connected to the adjacent black sea considered as a more realistic configuration for the air sea fluxes it is also noteworthy that this study presents a quantitative analysis for the ekman dynamics as opposed to previous qualitative studies e g discussing only the sst drop in more detail we estimated the wind stress curl and its impact on lowering the ocean stratification by increasing the vertical eddy diffusivity coefficient and thus the ekman layer the quantitative analysis estimated also the impact of the wave model further increasing the vertical eddy diffusivity and the ekman dynamics this work unravelled several effects of atmosphere wave ocean feedbacks on the selected medicane yielding valuable findings and also highlighting the importance of using a 3 way coupled modelling system like chaos consequently it is the authors intention to continue the investigation of atmosphere wave ocean interactions during cyclones and longer periods as well as to validate chaos with diverse observational networks so as to improve its performance additionally the direct impact of waves on upper ocean remains to be examined since it modifies ocean circulation vertical mixing surface stress and roughness as well as langmuir turbulence and coriolis stokes force breivik et al 2015 lewis et al 2019 rebalancing atmosphere wave ocean exchanges in particular we are interested on contributions of the coriolis stokes force and modifications brought to the turbulence kinetic energy scheme of nemo based on the langmuir turbulence the design of such an experiment remains to be investigated in

diagram assuming 3 way coupling simulation at the beginning of the coupled run the coupling fields that were exchanged between the models were retrieved from restart files including information from ecmwf analyses for wrf and from 2 month and 1 day pre processing simulations for nemo and wam respectively furthermore during the coupled integration at predefined timesteps coupling timesteps each model received the fields that were estimated by the other models and then sent its coupling fields however at a coupling timestep both models reached the point of executing the receiving process waited for the required fields and stopped any calculation to avoid such deadlock situation the relative order of oasis get and oasis put was changed by introducing the lag concept valcke et al 2015 setting a lag value for one of the models resulted in shifting of the time at which the data was sent but not the time at which the data was received in this case a lag of 1 wrf time step 30 s for wrf was set using this configuration nemo executed oasis get requesting the required fields for its next time step but it received the fields that were produced by the simulation of wrf at wrf timestep exchange timestep lag once wrf had completed the execution of this timestep it sent the fields through oasis put which were then propagated to nemo to continue at this point wrf executed oasis get expecting the required fields from nemo meanwhile having received the required fields to execute its next time step nemo executed its timestep calculating the fields wrf was waiting for and sent the respective data to it using oasis put in this way wrf resumed its execution for the next timestep and so on consequently wrf called oasis get and oasis put at every time step but the fields were exchanged only when wrf time exchange time for oasis get and wrf time exchange time lag for oasis put in contrast to wrf in nemo model the fields were exchanged for both oasis get and oasis put when nemo time exchange time similar was the exchange procedure between wrf and wam and between nemo and wam as shown in fig a 1 more technical information about coupling procedure between wrf and wam for instance can be found in varlas 2017 on each data exchange oasis3 mct transformed the data from the grid of the sender model to the grid of the receiver due to the fact that oasis3 mct internally used

23957,understanding the governing mechanisms of atmosphere wave ocean interactions is critical for unravelling the formation and evolution mechanisms of severe weather phenomena this study aims at investigating the effects of atmosphere wave ocean feedbacks on a mediterranean tropical like cyclone medicane occurred on 27 30 september 2018 at the central eastern mediterranean sea and characterized by severe environmental and socioeconomic impact to unveil the interactions across the air sea interface the medicane was simulated by an integrated modelling system consisting of the chemical hydrological atmospheric ocean wave system chaos upgraded by embedding to it the nucleus for european modelling of the ocean nemo as ocean circulation component coupled simulations revealed that air seaheat transfer and ekman pumping bringing sub surface cold waters in upper ocean layers upwelling caused sst cooling 2 3 c sst cooling triggered a negative feedback loop procedure tending to balance between atmospheric and ocean processes it also attenuated the cyclone and subsequently reduced the atmospheric energy embedded in ocean through the upper ocean vertical stratification weakening thus upper ocean vertical mixing upwelling and sst cooling the waves adjusted this feedback loop making the system more resistant in air sea flux variations waves additionally weakened the cyclone not only due to the kinetic energy loss in the lower atmosphere but also due to the enhancement of sst cooling which is attributed to the strengthening of ekman pumping and vertical mixing forced by wind stress increase nevertheless waves partially balanced the air wave sea exchanges through the slight enthalpy flux gain under high wind conditions which is explained by considering the increase of enthalpy transfer coefficient in rougher sea areas keywords chaos system wrf wam nemo coupled models air sea interaction momentum enthalpy medicane 1 introduction ocean is a huge energy recipient and regulator transferring momentum and heat around the globe through the thermohaline circulation stewart 2008 the exchange of momentum heat water and turbulent kinetic energy between atmosphere and ocean determines weather and climate bao et al 2000 ličer et al 2016 von schuckmann 2016 döös et al 2017 akhtar et al 2018 renault et al 2019 strajnar et al 2019 ocean waves play the role of dynamical interface between ocean and atmosphere janssen et al 2013 pianezze et al 2018 lewis et al 2019 waves modify wind stress and turbulent heat fluxes kudryavtsev and makin 2007 liu et al 2011 wada et al 2014 while nonbreaking wave induced mixing in upper ocean may lead to enhanced sst cooling and deepening of the mixed layer aijaz et al 2017 due to the complexity of physical mechanisms there is the necessity for a detailed description and a holistic approach in numerical modelling of atmosphere wave ocean interactions warner et al 2010 carniel et al 2016 ricchi et al 2016 2017 lewis et al 2019 wu et al 2019 bender et al 1993 showed that the application of atmosphere ocean coupled models in the simulation of tropical cyclones led to sea surface cooling along their track which in turn created negative forcing on their development and intensity lionello et al 2003 and pianezze et al 2018 observed sea surface temperature sst cooling along the track of mediterranean cyclones in atmosphere wave ocean coupled simulations sst cooling is critical because the spatiotemporal variability of sst affects air sea fluxes and thus the dynamics of the planetary boundary layer pbl as mentioned by stocchi and davolio 2016 for heavy precipitation episodes in the mediterranean prakash et al 2018 estimated sst cooling about 0 5 c in the bay of bengal during a cyclone attributing it to upwelling processes and ekman transport in the ocean additionally the study of lee and chen 2012 for hurricane frances presented 0 58 c sst cooling that led to decrease in enthalpy flux by about 20 and 15 applying atmosphere ocean and atmosphere wave ocean coupling respectively moreover ricchi et al 2016 2017 confirmed that considering atmosphere wave ocean feedbacks contributes to a better description of sst cooling attributed to wave induced ocean mixing moreover rapidly generated wind waves can sharply increase sea surface roughness in contrast to low steepness swell attenuating wind and subsequently wave growth janssen 1989 1991 2004 jenkins et al 2012 varlas et al 2018 wiese et al 2019 evidenced that atmosphere wave coupling had a detectable imprint at the height of the pbl in a case study of a low pressure system in the north sea moreover wahle et al 2017 showed that the simulation of atmosphere wave interactions during severe weather conditions resulted in decreased wave heights and attenuated winds sauvage et al 2020 also showed that the atmosphere wave coupling caused reduction of wind and wave while modifying the positioning of convergence and the heaviest precipitation during a severe weather event furthermore rizza et al 2018 found that the representation of sea spray effects in air sea momentum exchange resulted in more realistic simulation of a mediterranean tropical like cyclone medicane pianezze et al 2018 evidenced an attenuation of bejisa cyclone in the indian ocean due to the increase of the wave induced sea surface roughness in another numerical study grifoll et al 2016 showed a relatively small relevance of air sea transfer considering the significant wave height swh in the sea surface roughness parameterization in addition ricchi et al 2017 2019 and rizza et al 2018 showed that there is a non negligible improvement in the simulation of mediterranean cyclones considering physically based sea surface roughness in coupled simulations carniel et al 2016 found that the representation of turbulent heat fluxes was improved using coupled modelling systems while garg et al 2018 showed that the latent and sensible heat fluxes were increased due to the wave induced sea surface roughness although there have been great efforts to dynamically simulate exchanges between ocean and atmosphere especially during cyclonic events e g olabarrieta et al 2012 mogensen et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 lengaigne et al 2018 miglietta and rotunno 2019 several uncertainties still exist hence especially under severe weather conditions it is imperative to shed new light on the implementation of integrated modelling systems better considering atmosphere wave ocean feedbacks as well as representing atmosphere and ocean as a dynamically coupled system akhtar et al 2014 byrne et al 2016 katsafados et al 2016 2017 in this line katsafados et al 2016 implemented the coupled system wew which explicitly resolved atmosphere wave interactions in the mediterranean sea achieving a more realistic representation of aerodynamic drag over rough sea surfaces consequently varlas 2017 implemented the chemical hydrological atmospheric ocean wave system chaos varlas et al 2018 assessed atmosphere wave interactions represented by chaos during the formation of a cyclone at the mediterranean sea they concluded that the wave induced sea surface roughness in the atmospheric surface layer modifies the air sea momentum enthalpy and moisture transfer having effects even on middle upper troposphere as well as on cloud formation and precipitation this study intends to investigate the impact of atmosphere wave ocean interactions on the evolution of a strong mediterranean tropical like cyclone medicane occurred on 27 30 september 2018 at the central eastern mediterranean sea inducing severe environmental and socioeconomic consequences it is important to note here that medicanes are very rare phenomena with a frequency of 1 5 per year romero and emanuel 2013 or 1 6 per year cavicchia et al 2014 due to the specific air sea processes favouring their formation therefore they are considered as identical cases to assess atmosphere wave ocean interactions under severe conditions in order to unravel the feedback processes across the air sea interface the medicane was simulated by an integrated modelling system comprising the chemical hydrological atmospheric ocean wave system chaos varlas 2017 varlas et al 2018 upgraded by introducing to it the nucleus for european modelling of the ocean nemo madec 2012 as ocean circulation component the rest of the manuscript is organized as follows in section 2 an overview and a theoretical description of the upgraded chaos modelling system is given section 3 presents the experimental setup in section 4 atmosphere wave ocean interactions and upper ocean physical properties are dynamically assessed simulating the formation and evolution of the medicane finally section 5 contains a discussion of findings and the conclusions of this work 2 overview of chaos modelling system chaos was initially developed as a two way atmosphere wave coupled system varlas 2017 varlas et al 2018 including the weather research forecasting wrf model version 3 8 skamarock et al 2008 as atmospheric component and the ocean wave model wam

introduction of nemo version 3 6 model in chaos system which was carried out after extensive efforts on the coupling between wrf and nemo as well as between wam and nemo through the oasis3 mct coupler it is important to note that in varlas et al 2019a as well as in this work wrf was upgraded to the recent version 4 0 skamarock et al 2008 powers et al 2017 re implementing the oasis3 mct coupling

g zhang et al 2012 applications covering a broad spectrum of weather processes across scales ranging from metres to kilometres the current work is based on the version 4 0 of the advanced wrf wrf arw core which is skillful to resolve complex physical and dynamical processes during intense weather conditions varlas et al 2019a wrf is also suitably configured to optionally online couple wrf arw to chemistry wrf chem grell et al 2005 and hydrology wrf hydro gochis et al 2015 as described in varlas 2017 and varlas et al 2018 2019a 2020 however these sub components are not activated in this study 2 2 ocean wave component the ocean wave component was based on the cycle 4 5 4 of the wam model wamdi 1988 komen et al 1994 günther and behrens 2012 within the last three decades the wam model has become one of the most widely distributed and used models for operational wave prediction e g korres et al 2011 ravdas et al 2018 as well as for research purposes e g wahle et al 2017 katsafados et al 2016 2018 varlas et al 2018 2020 the wam solves the wave transport equation explicitly without any assumption on the shape of the wave spectrum it represents the physics of the wave evolution for the full set of degrees of freedom of a 2d wave spectrum moreover the model runs for any given regional or global grid with a prescribed bathymetric dataset and the grid resolution can be arbitrary in space and time 2 3 ocean circulation component the ocean circulation component was based on stable version 3 6 of the nemo model madec 2012 it is a primitive equation model adapted to regional and global ocean circulation studying the ocean and its interactions with the other components of the earth system over a wide range of spatiotemporal scales prognostic variables are the three dimensional velocity field a non linear sea surface height the conservative temperature and the absolute salinity projected onto an arakawa c type grid in this study we use also the nemo input output strategy connected to an external xml i o server i e xios in its version 2 0 under revision 1490 controlled by an xml extensible markup language file handling the i o specifications e g model variables and output frequencies a large number of numerical studies have been conducted using various configurations of nemo for the mediterranean sea like for instance the nemomed family from the french research community beuvier et al 2010 2012 and references within as well as the mediterranean forecasting system mfs from the italian research community oddo et al 2014 and references within recent studies have been also conducted with nemo using a regional configuration for the black sea cliberti et al 2018 gunduz et al 2020 2 4 coupler component the coupling of wrf wam and nemo models was based on oasis3 mct version 3 0 coupler valcke et al 2015 craig et al 2017 along with customized message passing interface mpi routines oasis3 mct is the state of the art of couplers with advanced capabilities in weather and climate modelling characterized by flexibility low intrusiveness portability and scalability valcke et al 2015 oasis3 mct is a coupling library to be linked to the component models supporting coupling procedures such as communication exchange and interpolation of fields in order for each component to be able to interact and exchange coupling fields with the other system components oasis3 mct interface must be implemented in its computational structure 2 5 coupling fields chaos modelling system was upgraded by coupling wrf and nemo as well as wam and nemo through the oasis3 mct coupler that enables the models to interact and exchange information fig 1 demonstrates the exchange of coupling fields among the components in more detail concerning the coupling between wrf and nemo wrf receives sst and the u and v components of surface ocean current velocity u c u r and v c u r estimated by nemo while nemo receives the u and v components of wind stress τ u and τ v the wind stress modulus τ the short wave solar radiation shf the long wave non solar radiation nshf the fresh water flux equal to the difference between evaporation and precipitation ev pr and the atmospheric pressure at the sea surface p s f c estimated by wrf as far as the coupling of wrf and wam is concerned wrf receives the charnock parameter based on janssen s 1989 1991 quasi linear theory of wind wave generation see section 2 6 the significant wave height swh the wave age and the phase velocity at the peak of the wave spectrum v p h a s e estimated by wam while wam receives the u and v components of wind speed at 10 m u 10 and v 10 produced by wrf varlas 2017 varlas et al 2018 it is important to note that in this study among the parameters received by wrf only the charnock parameter following janssen s 1989 1991 theory is used in the atmospheric surface layer processes additional wave parameters estimated by wam and received by wrf could also be used in alternative estimations of the charnock parameter through wave age smith et al 1992 drennan et al 2005 liu et al 2011 as well as wave steepness taylor and yelland 2001 that is calculated using the significant wave height and the wavelength or via phase velocity at the peak of the wave spectrum the alternative estimations of the charnock parameter proposed by smith et al 1992 taylor and yelland 2001 drennan et al 2005 and liu et al 2011 have already been implemented in chaos as described in varlas 2017 but they are not presented in this study as regards the coupling of wam and nemo wam receives the u and v components of surface ocean current velocity u c u r and v c u r from nemo modifying wave refraction as described in ozer et al 2000 currently nemo does not receive wave parameters estimated by wam receives only implicit information through changes in the wind stress as estimated by wrf wam interaction but this is in the future plans of the authors more technical details about the coupling design and strategy as well as the timing of exchange procedure among chaos components can be found in appendix a 2 6 theoretical background of coupling procedure the dynamical and thermodynamic interactions among the lower atmosphere the ocean waves and the upper ocean determine the energy equilibria across air sea interface the momentum flux or kinematic stress τ and the enthalpy flux e which is the total of sensible h and latent l h heat fluxes are the most essential parameters for analysing air sea transfer processes varlas et al 2018 wrf model estimates these parameters over the sea as follows fairall

air kinematic viscosity and a is the charnock parameter the charnock parameter represents the sea state impact on the lowest part of the atmosphere affecting the surface layer processes katsafados et al 2016 in chaos the charnock parameter can be online estimated by wam incorporating information for the sea state in the surface layer parameterization of wrf following janssen s 1989 1991 quasi linear theory of wind wave generation according to janssen 1989 1991 2004 the charnock parameter depends on sea state through the ratio between the wave induced stress τ w and the sum of the wave induced stress and the turbulent stress neglecting the viscous stress namely total stress τ as follows 2 6 α 0 01 1 τ w τ more details for the estimation of wave induced charnock parameter in chaos can be found in varlas 2017 and varlas et al 2018 as far as the nemo ocean model is concerned we briefly recapitulate its primitive equations in order to highlight the physics controlled by variables

horizontal bilaplacian diffusion operators along geopotential levels are used for both momentum eddy viscosity and tracers eddy diffusivity coefficients with their values set at 1 25 1010 m4 s 1 and 1 25 10 9 m4 s 1 respectively a partial slip is also applied for the lateral boundary condition of the tangential velocity at the coast except along the gibraltar dardanelles and bosporus straits using a strong slip option 3 experimental setup 3 1 case study medicane 27 30 september 2018 chaos after its major upgrade with nemo was assessed simulating the medicane occurred on 27 30 september 2018 at the central eastern mediterranean sea and initially formed on 27 september 2018 at the northeastern coast of libya the medicane begun to rapidly deepen on 27 september at 18 00 utc fig 2a according to the analysis of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf the cyclonic system formed under the support of a cold cut off upper air trough portmann et al 2019 and high ssts locally exceeding even 25 26 c as will be shown in following section at this area the cut off trough originated from the continental europe fed the northwestern parts of the cyclone with cold upper air masses accompanied by low geopotential heights and positive vorticity not shown triggering its intensification the role of cut off trough was important to the formation of such an intense tropical like cyclone the trough gradually circled the cyclone forcing it to stay almost stagnant over the southern ionian sea the cold upper air intrusion in combination with the significant amount of trapped heat and moisture in the lower troposphere and the weak vertical shear drove to significant vertical instability and deep convection favouring the gradual transition to a tropical like cyclone it is important to note here that the medicane continued to intensify despite the colder ssts ranging from 21 to 24 c existing along its northward trajectory this is a critical difference generally observed between medicanes and tropical cyclones which are developed only over warm seas 26 c as noted by tous and romero 2013 the explanation for this behaviour is the existence of upper air induced baroclinic environment during the development of medicanes in contrast to tropical cyclones that are much more dependent on high ssts as warmer tropics are free of baroclinic influences tous and romero 2013 therefore the sea atmosphere thermodynamical disequilibrium in mediterranean basin supports the development of tropical like cyclones at much lower ssts comparing with the tropics tous and romero 2013 on 28 september at 12 00 utc the cyclonic system seems strong with compact vertical structure characterized by warm seclusion and tropical like properties as evidenced by the high 500 hpa temperatures in the medicane s core fig 2b the tropical like phase of the medicane was also characterized by a small circular eye surrounded by an eyewall and an approximately axisymmetric pattern of deep convective clouds spinning around the eye fig 2c the important role of upper air conditions such as cut off troughs in the formation of medicanes as well as their characteristics such as the warm core the small eye and the eyewall circled by deep convective clouds are also noted by several relevant studies e g pytharoulis et al 2000 fita et al 2007 moscatello et al 2008 miglietta et al 2011 tous et al 2013 pytharoulis 2018 miglietta and rotunno 2019 noyelle et al 2019 the fact that the cyclone caused gale force winds and high waves as well as it remained for almost 36 h over the southern ionian sea makes it an ideal case study to assess chaos sensitivity on dynamical lower boundary conditions posed by the nemo model before dissipating over the regional greece and partly over the aegean sea from 29 september at 12 00 utc to 30 september at 18 00 utc the medicane made landfall at southwestern coast of peloponnese greece on 29 september at 09 15 utc according to a meteosat 11 visible image fig 2d the medicane was related to 3 deaths in greece having a severe environmental and socioeconomic impact while also affected libya tunisia and turkey 3 2 chaos configuration in order to simulate the lifecycle of the medicane over the open sea until its landfall at the southwestern greece chaos was configured to perform 48 h sensitivity tests in the period from 27 september at 12 00 utc to 29 september at 12 00 utc chaos components were set up on domains covering the mediterranean and black seas as depicted on fig 3a the northwestern corner of nemo domain is out of the wrf domain but it does not affect the simulations because the bay of biscay is masked as land more details are presented in the following sub section 3 3 atmospheric component setup the atmospheric component of chaos had a grid spacing of 9 km 9 km with 600 310 c grid points timestep of 30 s and 33 vertical levels stretching from the surface up to 50 hpa and covered the mediterranean sea part of north africa and most of europe fig 3a gridded analysis data from ecmwf on a horizontal resolution of 0 1 0 1 and a time increment of 6 h were used for the creation of initial and boundary conditions of the atmospheric component as far as the parameterizations of atmospheric mechanisms are concerned the revised monin obukhov scheme jiménez et al 2012 was used to simulate the processes in the surface layer comprising several modifications to encapsulate sea state information as described in varlas 2017 and varlas et al 2018 it is important to note that dissipative heating effect was also activated in the surface layer processes for enhancing sensible heat flux this effect was also taken into consideration by katsafados et al 2018 in a chaos simulation of hurricane sandy 2012 at the atlantic ocean because it is critical in the cases of severe cyclonic systems planetary boundary layer pbl processes were resolved by the yonsei university scheme hong et al 2006 ysu the ground processes were simulated using the unified land surface model tewari et al 2004 unified noah in order to resolve the long wave and short wave radiation processes the rrtmg iacono et al 2008 was used thompson scheme was applied for the cloud microphysics thompson et al 2008 and the grell freitas ensemble scheme grell and freitas 2014 was used for the convective processes moreover the global multi resolution terrain elevation data gmted 2010 30 arc sec usgs danielson and gesch 2011 the modis fpar vegetation data myneni et al 2002 and the 21 class igbp modis land use data friedl et al 2010 were employed as static input data of the model the over sea lower boundary conditions of wrf sst as well as u and v components of current velocity were provided by nemo while charnock was based on wam it is important to note that null current values sst analysis data provided by the copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems and charnock parameter equal to 0 0185 as also used by varlas et al 2018 were set as constant lower boundary conditions for areas of wrf domain outside the nemo and wam domains respectively to reduce erroneously values at the transition zone of the different model domains an algorithm was designed to apply a 1 2 1 smoothing filter along models boundaries 3 4 wave component setup concerning the wam model setup the grid covered the geographical area 8 w to 42 e and 29 n to 48 n as shown in fig 3a red line using a resolution of 0 1 0 1 with 501 191 regular lat lon points wam had a propagation timestep of 72 s and a source timestep of 720 s 12 min moreover wam used 24 directional bins 15 directional resolution and 25 frequency bins ranging from 0 042 to 0 411 hz to represent the wave spectra distribution wam also used bathymetric data based on etopo1 dataset amante and eakins 2009 1 min gridded global relief data the input bathymetric data was constructed applying bi linear interpolation and some degree of smoothing while local corrections were introduced in shallow areas of mediterranean and black sea basins fig 3b furthermore shallow water approximation including depth refraction and depth induced wave breaking battjes and janssen 1978 was employed due to the complex bathymetry of the mediterranean and black seas the shallow water approximation represents the wave energy loss due to bottom friction and percolation and it is preferred for high resolution simulations e g monbaliu et al 2010 korres et al 2011 it is important to note here that the western boundaries of the domain in the atlantic ocean were considered as closed without using lateral boundary conditions from global wave models or analysis data in addition as proposed by katsafados et al 2016 the gibraltar the dardanelles and the bosporus straits were also considered to be closed boundaries therefore wave energy was prevented to be advected through these channels moreover wam was set up to be initialized using the hot start approach see günther and behrens 2012 based on a 1 day spin up simulation in order to obtain a realistic initial wave spectrum similar initialization approach for wam was also followed by varlas et al 2018 3 5 ocean circulation component setup as regards the model setup to simulate the oceanic circulation a nemo based regional configuration was used covering the mediterranean and black seas 9 w to 42 6 e and 30 n to 50 3 n as shown in fig 3a blue line explicitly connected through the marmara sea from the dardanelles and bosporus straits using a strong slip option for the tangential velocity at the coast near the straits fig 3c the bay of biscay and the sea of azov in the northwestern and northeastern corners were masked as land grid points the primitive equations were discretized on a 1 12 curvilinear arakawa c grid 7 9 km at mid latitudes 609 320 grid points assuming hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations based on the orca tripolar grid barnier et al 2006 at this resolution the ocean model is eddy permitting resolving one to two rossby radii of deformation in the mediterranean sea beuvier et al 2012 the regional domain hereafter medx12 x stands for an extended mediterranean configuration including the black sea was extracted with the siren tool as an exact 1 1 subset of the global operational system psy4v3r1 http marine copernicus eu the vertical discretization had 50 z levels with partial steps to allow for an accurate representation of the seabed the system had 1 m resolution at the surface decreasing to 450 m at the bottom with 22 levels in the upper 100 m the bathymetry was a merge of etopo1 amante and eakins 2009 over the mediterranean sea and gebco 2014 weatherall et al 2015 datasets over the black sea the minimum depth was set at 12 m and therefore the upper layers had 9 wet levels we note that the projection of the bathymetric data on both ocean and wave model domains is expected to be different since they have different resolutions map projections land sea masks open boundaries and model physics constraints to name but a few the medx12 grid set up based on the parent system psy4v3r1 simplifies and increases the robustness of the nesting procedure using as initial and open boundary conditions the prescribed 3d analysis fields of the full ocean state vector ssh t s u v from the daily archives of cmems http marine copernicus eu the western boundary of the ocean model was set in the atlantic ocean at 9 w including a buffer zone of approximately 1 a strong damping for the tracers and the baroclinic velocities was applied in the buffer zone with a restoring timescale set at 1 day a split explicit free surface time splitting scheme was used to simulate properly fast external gravity waves shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the model simulated tides and the inverse barometer ib effect and included their fast components in the open boundary the flather 1994 scheme was imposed as a radiation condition to add the tidal harmonic forcing in the open boundary the tidal components were provided by the tpxo7 2 global model of ocean tides egbert and erofeeva 2002 as the sum of 11 constituents m2 s2 k2 n2 k1 o1 p1 q1 m4 mf mm the ib was added in the open boundary to account for the sea level response to pressure variations a barotropic short timestep was set at 17 s and a costlier baroclinic update of the depth varying prognostic variables was set at 240 s once in production the model is stable with a less costly baroclinic timestep e g 480 s however the former choice ensures the robustness of the tri coupled system initialized from the 3d analysis fields of the full ocean state vector climatological monthly values of flow rates were prescribed for six major rivers in the mediterranean sea i e ebro rhone po from grdc 2014 and axios evros nile after the aswan dam from vervatis et al 2013 and references within and five major rivers in the black sea i e danube dnieper dniester rioni kizilirmak from grdc 2014 fig 3c represented by red dots the rivers were imposed as a surface boundary freshwater flux of constant salinity 0 1 enhanced vertical diffusion at the river mouths with mixing coefficient 10 3 m2 s 1 was applied to mix the freshwater over the top 12 m of the water column 3 6 ocean circulation component spin up in order to develop coherent structures and represent the main physical processes for the upper ocean in the mediterranean and black seas we have performed a 2 month spin up simulation of the ocean model in offline mode nemo was initialized on 1 august 2018 at 00 00 utc using the cmems 3d analysis fields of the full ocean state vector ssh t s u v boundary conditions were provided by the daily archives of cmems and the flux fields from a series of chaos uncoupled simulations more specifically chaos was set up to perform continuous 36 h simulations providing the necessary hourly flux fields for nemo it is noteworthy that the regional model medx12 and the operational system psy4v3r1 provides the restart and boundary analysis fields http marine copernicus eu share the same grids and resolution but have different model setup in terms of physics and forcing e g tides inverse barometer therefore we argue that the 2 month free run is adequate to capture the intra seasonal variability of the upper ocean water column structure important for the test case presented in this study whilst the intermediate and deep layers are close to the analysis fields longer simulations resolving the overturning circulation of the mediterranean sea were deemed as out of scope for the present work and in addition would compromise the performance of the system for this extreme weather event under investigation deviating from analysis i e no data assimilation and no relaxation restoring terms the output from the 2 month simulation of nemo was used as the sea state initial condition for all sensitivity simulations performed in this work 3 7 design of sensitivity simulations the upgraded version of chaos offers the capability to represent atmosphere wave ocean interactions this is based on the online exchange of information among the components using the oasis3 mct coupler it is important to note that wrf was initialized with the sst produced by the spin up nemo simulation instead of cmems analysis data for 27 september for assuring the consistency of initial and nemo based ssts throughout all the simulations the initial sst field was a synthesis of the sst output of the spin up nemo simulation and the cmems based sst outside the nemo domain using 1 2 1 smoothing at the domain borders fig 4 shows the sst field used in the initialization of the wrf simulations moreover the initialization of all the coupling fields was based on the results of the wrf nemo and wrf wam spin up simulations for 27 september at 12 00 utc in this way wrf wam and nemo were initialized on 27 september at 12 00 utc using the same physically generated coupling fields in the three sensitivity simulations avoiding inconsistent values in the initialization in order to analyse the two way feedbacks in each interaction as well as to assess the sensitivity of the system three simulation approaches were conducted following different coupling strategy among the chaos components therefore the sensitivity tests were based on the following chaos numerical experiments 1 way wrf was one way coupled with nemo and wam through the oasis3 mct coupler wrf online provided the necessary coupling fields to nemo and wam models every 1 h but did not get any feedback from nemo and wam therefore wrf used constant sst equal to initial resulted by the spin up nemo simulation and constant charnock 0 0185 fields throughout the simulation meanwhile wam ran with null currents since there was no communication with nemo this methodological approach is common and is used in uncoupled offline systems 2 way wrf and nemo models were two way coupled while wrf and wam models were one way coupled through the oasis3 mct coupler wrf and nemo were set to exchange information every 4 min while wrf and wam every 12 min hence wrf got feedback from nemo but it did not get wave information from wam moreover nemo and wam did not interact 3 way wrf was two way coupled with nemo and with wam while nemo and wam were 1 way coupled through the oasis3 mct coupler fig 1 therefore this simulation mode can be considered that represents 3 way atmosphere wave ocean coupling wrf nemo and wrf wam exchange times were the same as in the 2 way configuration while nemo and wam exchanged information every 12 min i e wam received ocean surface currents from nemo thus nemo did not directly get wave information from wam but only indirectly through the impact of wave stress on the lower atmospheric processes resolved by wrf and subsequently on wrf estimated atmospheric fluxes imposed on ocean 4 atmosphere wave ocean dynamical assessment the results derived from the three simulations were merged in the same figures in order to practically assess the atmosphere wave ocean interactions in this way factors that determine the formation of the cyclone as well as feedbacks between lower atmosphere waves and upper ocean can be properly traced we have emphasized on 28 september 2018 when the cyclone remained almost stagnant over the southern ionian sea 4 1 upper ocean dynamical assessment here we focus on the dynamical aspects of the cyclone altering the upper water column structure as well as we compare the sensitivity simulations showcasing their differences the sst cooling over the ionian sea during the period of the lifecycle of the medicane over the open sea until its landfall was at about 1 56 0 21 c 1 28 0 18 c and 1 35 0 18 c for the 1 way 2 way and 3 way simulations respectively in fig 5 we illustrate the ekman and mixed layer dynamics induced by the intensity of the medicane the complexity introduced by different interaction processes in the three simulations and some local aspects in the ionian sea due to the different positioning of the cyclone in the three simulations the remote impact of the system in adjacent seas was also noticeable but a detailed analysis is out of scope in this work as will be shown in a similar analysis for the atmospheric and ocean wave parameters in the following sections the wind stress of the cyclone in the 3 way simulation was controlled by feedback mechanisms with its south southwest side enhanced on 28 september 2018 at 12 00 utc fig 5a the intensity of the cyclone had a significant impact on the properties of the water column an increase in the wind stress enhanced the ocean vertical mixing exhibiting similar patterns fig 5b and in turn increased the ekman layer and the mld fig 5c the cyclone s wind stress relative vorticity was highly increased in the area expressed by the vector τ f with positive values reaching up to 0 6 n m 3 s leading to open ocean upwelling as a result of ekman pumping and subsequently decreasing sst fig 5d the heat fluxes also contributed to the weakening of the ocean stratification through buoyancy loss mainly observed on the south southwest side of the cyclone where the net downward heat flux at the sea surface exceeded a loss for the ocean about 200 w m 2 fig 5e we investigate the increasing complexity of the coupling modes between the chaos components controlling the atmosphere wave ocean feedbacks for the sake of clarity we state that the cyclone was not dynamically controlled by the ocean state in the 1 way simulation since 1 the sst was imposed on wrf as static field taken from initial conditions whereas in nemo the sst was dynamically computed 2 the surface ocean currents were taken as null fields and 3 charnock was considered by wrf as constant 0 0185 field as a first step we examine the differences in nemo results between the two simulations 2 way minus 1 way to isolate the impact of the air seainteraction fig 5k o the cyclone s intensity in the 2 way experiment was on average decreased over the ionian sea compared with the 1 way and this was also reflected on the wind stress fig 5k since the wind velocities were reduced the positive negative wind stress filaments in fig 5k are attributed to the different positioning of the cyclone between the two experiments in the same line of thinking the decrease in the wind stress had a direct impact on increasing the upper ocean stratification fig 5l due to reduced ekman dynamics their patterns are shown to be similar i e fig 5k l followed also by a decrease in mld but with more noisy patterns controlled by additional processes fig 5m as a result the open ocean upwelling estimated by nemo was reduced in the 2 way simulation and the sst was increased almost everywhere in the ionian sea locally exceeding 0 5 c compared with the nemo estimated sst evolving in time in the 1 way experiment fig 5n characterized by more intense upwelling in addition this comparison shows that the heat fluxes contributed to lowering the sst since the turbulent heat loss fluxes from the ocean to the atmosphere were larger in the nemo 1 way simulation sustained by a more intense cyclone compared with the 2 way run this increase of heat loss in the 1 way simulation exceeded 200 w m 2 and 50 w m 2 for the ocean locally and on average for the whole ionian sea respectively we now consider the difference between the 3 way and 2 way simulations i e 3 way minus 2 way in the 3 way simulation the cyclone s intensity was reduced compared with the simpler 2 way coupling and their differences were minor in fig 5j the difference of the heat fluxes between the coupled simulations was on average zero estimated by the hourly fields and depicted by positive negative filament patterns in the area spanned by the cyclone according to this the changes observed between the experiments can be linked to the momentum fluxes imposed implicitly by the wave model through the wind stress to the ocean state we also note that in 3 way coupling mode both wrf and wam simulated less intense wind wave fields among all experiments as it will be shown in the following sections however the wind stress and subsequently the ocean vertical mixing and the mld were notably increased the latter being driven by ekman dynamics fig 5f h in this context the most prominent feature is the decrease of the sst locally reaching 0 5 c fig 5i as a result of induced open ocean upwelling additional thermodynamic processes e g based on the enthalpy flux for the sst decrease in the 3 way coupling are discussed in following sections overall we found that the impact of the ocean state on the atmospheric system can be reversed from being negative to positive feedback depending on whether the ocean wave model is coupled or not the ocean model was compared with the ostia dataset during the period of the medicane as well as for the whole spin up period the sst l4 cmems product corresponds to daily gridded optimally interpolated gap free satellite estimates at 1 16 high resolution in order to evaluate the cyclone s impact we focus our investigation over the ionian sea fig 6 presents the taylor diagram taylor 2001 comparing the ocean model sst for the simulation experiments against the ostia data by means of standard deviation centred root mean square difference rmsd and correlation the quantitative metrics confirm that all model simulations were skillful in estimating the sst shown to be well correlated with the observations the rmsd and standard deviation metrics are kept within an acceptable range of sst values pertaining to the fact that the accuracy of the ostia sst system against in situ observations is occasionally higher than 0 5 k rmsd donlon et al 2012 although the correlation is a bit stronger for the sensitivity simulations compared to spin up the rmsd and standard deviation metrics slightly degrade mainly because of two reasons a the spin up run is closer to the analysis fields used to initialize the model on 1 august 2018 at 00 00 utc and b the ostia sst analysis error is larger during the period of the cyclone simulations due to gaps in the l3 data prior to oi overall there is a small but marked increase in the skill metrics between the three cyclone experiments with the 3 way simulation being the most skillful in a similar vein we compare the model s upper ocean water column structure between the three cyclone experiments against the in situ observations retrieved from the only available argo float in the area during the event fig 7 in this area under the impact of the cyclone the ocean model is shown to enhance upper ocean cooling as the event progresses we note that the cooling is smaller in the 3 way and 2 way simulations whilst overestimates vertical mixing in the upper 40 m depth on the other hand the model is shown to be skillful in estimating the thermocline depth as well as the potential temperature at intermediate layers 4 2 effects on air sea momentum flux the analysis of momentum flux is also presented for 28 september 2018 at 12 00 utc when the medicane covered widespread open sea area in the southern ionian sea in response to rough sea areas with high roughness length z 0 at the southward of the medicane s eye fig 8a the air sea momentum flux reached 2 n m 2 in the 3 way simulation fig 8b the gale force westerly winds at this area of eyewall resulted in rapidly generated waves that increased sea surface roughness the role of high frequency wind generated waves on roughness increase was also highlighted by jenkins et al 2012 and varlas et al 2018 nevertheless as shown in fig 8 c the maximum of significant wave height exceeding 6 m was presented at the northwestern of the cyclone this is attributed to the trajectory of the system which was moving northwestward building up higher waves fig 8 d f shows the differences 3 way minus 2 way while fig 8 g i the differences 2 way minus 1 way for roughness length air sea momentum flux and swh respectively in contrast to 2 way simulation 3 way is characterized by higher roughness length fig 8d due to the introduction of sea state dependent stress in the atmospheric surface layer processes this resulted in increase of momentum flux from the lower layers of atmosphere to the sea fig 8e and led to loss of atmospheric kinetic energy and reduction of swh fig 8f similar results were presented by wahle et al 2017 and varlas et al 2018 on the other hand comparing 2 way and 1 way simulations 2 way demonstrates a decrease in momentum flux and swh however roughness length is almost unaffected fig 8g i such response is attributed to the air sea enthalpy flux in 2 way experiment that was forced by the introduction of the nemo model resulting in sst cooling as analysed in the previous section fig 9 a c depicts the effects on surface momentum flux for the period from 27 september at 18 00 utc to 29 september at 12 00 utc 2018 as regards the areas affected by the cyclone comparing to the 1 way and 2 way simulations the increase of roughness length in the 3 way simulation resulted in an increase of the c d drag coefficient and subsequently of the momentum flux another interesting remark in fig 9 is that roughness length drag coefficient and momentum flux are shown to have large spread with the wind speed compared with the 1 way and 2 way simulations the latter indicates that the wave coupling greatly alters the cyclone s properties for instance the maximum values of the wind speed are reduced but the momentum fluxes are distributed on a wider range of the energy spectrum this fact highlights the highly non linear character of the wave coupling influencing the evolution of the cyclone 4 3 effects on air sea enthalpy flux continuing the analysis for 28 september 2018 at 12 00 utc air sea enthalpy flux exceeded 800 w m 2 in the 3 way simulation fig 10c reaching a maximum of 891 w m 2 collocating with wind fig 10a and sst fig 10b maxima of 14 m s 1 and 25 c respectively it is important to note that surface enthalpy flux was lower in the eyewall of the medicane characterized by winds exceeding 22 m s 1 and sst ranging from 22 c to 24 c than the southwestern areas with weaker winds and higher ssts fig 10a c this is attributed to the dependence of enthalpy flux not only on wind speed but also on sea air temperature difference see eq 4 the latter term is expected to be larger at the southwestern areas because wind originated from areas over fresh water masses moves to areas over warmer waters while also accelerates over strong gradients of sst e g o neill et al 2010 this phenomenon increases sea air temperature difference feeding the southwestern parts of the medicane with significant amounts of enthalpy while defines the sustained winds through the sst induced modification of surface vorticity and divergence e g chelton et al 2007 o neill et al 2010 this also highlights the importance of sst and its gradients in the ocean to atmosphere heat transfer during the formation of cyclonic systems as also discussed by varlas et al 2019b c fig 10 d f demonstrates the differences 3 way minus 2 way while fig 10 g i the differences 2 way minus 1 way for wind speed sst and air sea enthalpy flux respectively at this point we ought to state again that those are the fields seen by wrf i e imposed to or estimated by wrf in particular for the 1 way experiment the sst used during the whole cyclone simulation is the one used as an initial condition on 27 september 2018 at 12 00 utc therefore the comparison between 2 way and 1 way simulations indicates sst cooling fig 10h as opposed to fig 5n depicting nemo estimated sst evolving in time in 1 way simulation sst cooling reached 2 3 c and weakened enthalpy flux fig 10i attenuating cyclone s sustained winds fig 10g comparing 3 way and 2 way 3 way run resulted in attenuated lower atmospheric flow as discussed in the previous section despite the appearance of some local maxima minima in the wind field fig 10d which can be explained by the differences in the simulated medicane s track despite the attenuation of winds in 3 way run the increase of sea surface roughness strengthened wind stress which subsequently drove to enhanced upwelling in the upper ocean slightly reducing sst but locally increasing enthalpy flux fig 10e f the increase of enthalpy flux is explained by the dependence of the c k enthalpy transfer coefficient on the sea surface roughness as also noted by varlas et al 2018 fig 11a reveals that c k is more scattered in the 3 way simulation exceeding 1 way and 2 way values especially under high winds this behaviour in 3 way run is attributed to the increase of sea surface roughness due to wave stress having a positive impact on c k enthalpy transfer coefficient and thus preserving the enthalpy flux in considerable levels even under wind attenuation fig 11b and sst cooling fig 11c conditions hence the role of waves on the feedback loops among atmosphere waves and upper ocean is to make the system more resistant in air sea flux variabilities waves weakened the cyclone due to momentum flux but strengthened it through the increase of c k partially balancing the upper ocean negative feedback in a more realistic way focusing on the role of sea state on c k and c d coefficients can unveil the negative impact of sea state dependent charnock parameter on the medicane s energy balance in particular fig 11d illustrates the c k c d ratio which is used as an indicator of the energy equilibrium that determines the structure and intensity of tropical cyclones e g emanuel 1995 the c k c d ratio is more scattered in the 3 way coupled simulation indicating the regulating role of the spatially varying charnock on the momentum and enthalpy transfer coefficients it is meaningful to note that in the 3 way coupled simulation a decrease of the ratio is presented in moderate and high wind speeds indicating that the energy loss due to the momentum transferred to waves exceeded the enthalpy gain of lower atmospheric layers therefore this equilibrium caused a reduction of the medicane s energy content having also a negative effect on its development 4 4 impact on track and precipitation fig 12a illustrates the track of the medicane from 27 september at 12 00 utc to 29 september at 12 00 utc as simulated by the 1 way 2 way and 3 way experiments and also analysed by the ecmwf fig 12a also shows the minima of mean sea level pressure mslp every 6 h based on the simulation results and the ecmwf analyses the same figure also presents near landfall measurements of a nearby surface meteorological station at geraki and the buoy 68422 located offshore of pylos peloponnese the measured mslp values did not refer to the same locations of simulated and analysed mslp maxima so they only offered valuable information about mslp during landfall but they were not be used for evaluation of simulations the impact of 2 way and 3 way coupling on air sea momentum and enthalpy exchange was reflected on the evolution and the track of the medicane the estimated geometric distance between the tracks based on the ecmwf analyses and the three experiments ranged from 2 to 60 km the estimated average distances for 3 way 2 way and 1 way simulations were 27 km 30 km and 29 km respectively despite the small differences among the simulations the 3 way experiment improved the representation of medicane s trajectory presenting slightly smaller average distance in comparison with the two other simulations furthermore fig 12b demonstrates timeseries of mslp minima and sustained wind speed maxima from 27 september at 12 00 utc to 29 september at 12 00 utc for the three simulation every 1 h and for ecmwf analyses every 6 h it is meaningful to note that the 2 way and more the 3 way coupling drove to the simulation of shallower weaker medicane comparing with the results of the 1 way experiment as illustrated in fig 12b the shallowing impact of 2 way and 3 way coupling was reflected on mslp even exceeding 4 hpa difference in comparison with 1 way while the negative effect of 3 way coupling on the intensity of the sustained winds reached approximately 9 m s 1 besides the 1 way simulation 2 way and 3 way increased mslp per 3 3 hpa on 29 september at 00 00 utc and 3 9 hpa at 06 00 utc respectively improving the agreement with the ecmwf analyses and the measurements table 1 these findings reveal the importance of atmosphere wave ocean feedbacks in the simulation of the medicane and its properties such as mslp and sustained winds it is essential to note here that the results and measurements presented in table 1 refer to different locations in order to avoid inaccuracies due to track and phase variations in the medicane simulations this study does not aim to a thorough statistical assessment of chaos e g varlas et al 2020 so we do not use strict evaluation techniques for mslp in this way we can unveil the impact of coupling approaches on the dynamic evolution of the cyclone simply comparing with the near real state evidenced by the ecmwf analyses and the measurements presented in fig 12a moreover improvements are also evidenced for wind speed and swh estimation comparing with measurements in this comparison we extracted the model values in the locations of the measurements adopting a nearest neighbour interpolation approach varlas et al 2018 according to the measurements of buoy 68422 on 29 september at 06 00 utc wind speed reached 16 2 m s 1 while 1 way 2 way and 3 way simulations resulted in wind speed equal to 22 4 m s 1 20 2 m s 1 and 17 6 m s 1 respectively as far as the swh is concerned the buoy measured 4 8 m at the same time while 1 way 2 way and 3 way simulations resulted in 5 9 m 5 1 m and 4 9 m respectively the overall attenuation of the cyclone in both 2 way and 3 way simulations resulted in reduction of total accumulated precipitation during the 42 h period from 27 september at 18 00 utc to 29 september at 12 00 utc fig 13a c the decrease observed in the precipitation in 2 way fig 13b and 3 way fig 13c simulations compared to 1 way fig 13a seems to agree with the measurements of the meteorological station at geraki for the same period geraki station measured accumulated precipitation equal to 41 2 mm while 1 way 2 way and 3 way estimated 124 mm 79 4 mm and 73 4 mm respectively the highest improvements for 3 way and 2 way were achieved in 6 h periods from 12 00 utc to 18 00 utc on 28 september with 34 4 mm 30 6 mm 17 8 mm and 14 4 mm for 1 way 2 way 3 way and measured respectively as well as from 06 00 utc to 12 00 utc on 29 september with 79 mm 32 9 mm 45 6 mm and 11 4 mm respectively the encouraging results of the comparison among the simulations highlight the advantages of the more complex coupling mechanisms of the 2 way and 3 way simulation resulting in more realistic simulation of the medicane s formation 5 discussion and conclusions this study presented the investigation of the influence ofatmosphere wave ocean feedbacks on a medicane 27 30 september 2018 at the central eastern mediterranean sea characterized by severe environmental and socioeconomic effects to this end a major upgrade of the chemical hydrological atmospheric ocean wave system chaos system was performed embedding to it the nucleus for european modelling of the ocean nemo as ocean circulation component the introduction of nemo in chaos made feasible the ingestion of physically based sea surface temperature and currents as dynamical lower boundary forcing in atmospheric modelling as well as sea surface current information in wave refraction modelling three simulation approaches following different coupling strategy among the chaos components were designed 1 way wrf was one way coupled with nemo and wam through the oasis3 mct coupler 2 way wrf and nemo models were two way coupled while wrf and wam models were one way coupled through the oasis3 mct coupler and 3 way wrf was two way coupled with nemo and wam while nemo and wam were one way coupled through the oasis3 mct coupler we note that in the 3 way simulation wam receives nemo surface currents but nemo receives only implicit information from wam through changes in the wind stress estimated by wrf wam interaction physical interactions considered in the upgraded chaos weremainly driven by the enthalpy and momentum exchanges in theatmosphere wave ocean system considering the effects of resolvedocean circulation and wave generation on atmospheric processes and consequently their feedbacks to wave and upper ocean mechanisms as regards the atmospheric response sst cooling locally up to 2 3 c in 2 way simulation did not allow the medicane to be fed with enough heat so it was weaker than in the 1 way simulation the representation of sst cooling and its effects comes to an agreement with bender et al 1993 lionello et al 2003 and pianezze et al 2018 who reached similar results along the track of cyclones the sst cooling initiated a negative feedback loop mechanism tending to an equilibrium between atmospheric and ocean processes sst cooling weakened the cyclone and attenuated the atmospheric energy embedded in ocean through upper ocean vertical stratification weakening thus upper ocean vertical mixing upwelling and subsequently sst cooling in the 3 way coupling the introduction of wave induced stress in the atmospheric surface layer processes increased the momentum flux to the ocean surface and as a result the medicane lost kinetic energy nevertheless wave induced stress caused a slight increase of enthalpy flux under high winds due to the increase of enthalpy transfer coefficient c k which is dependent on sea surface roughness length z 0 the latter effect partially balanced the air wave sea exchanges in a more realistic way therefore the role of waves on the air wave sea feedback loop was to make the system more resilient in the variabilities of fluxes between the two fluid mediums it is also noteworthy that a wave induced reduction of the c k c d ratio was evidenced in moderate and high wind intensities in the 3 way coupled simulation revealing that the energy loss due to the momentum transferred to waves exceeded the enthalpy gain of lower atmospheric layers this balance indicates a wave induced negative effect of 3 way coupling on the energy content and the development of the medicane moreover in the 3 way coupled simulation wave induced stress enhanced ekman pumping and sst cooling through the modification of wind stress estimated by the atmospheric component and transferred to the ocean circulation component imposing momentum flux in the upper ocean layer increasing vertical mixing it is noteworthy that the 2 way and more the 3 way simulations simulated a less intense system by increasing its minimum mslp and reducing wind speed while 3 way slightly improved its track this finding is in accordance with wahle et al 2017 who also observed similar effects in 2 way atmosphere wave simulations as far as precipitation is concerned the overall attenuation of the cyclone strength in both 2 way and 3 way simulations resulted in the reduction of total accumulated precipitation during the lifecycle of the medicane above open sea the attenuation of the system in 2 way and 3 way simulations is attributed to the impact of coupling complexity on the surface enthalpy and momentum fluxes which is feasible only considering contrary air wave sea feedbacks as far as the innovative features of this work are concerned it is meaningful to note that this coupled modelling study is the first combining wrf wam nemo models running in this sequence considering atmosphere wave ocean feedbacks at the mediterranean and black seas moreover the nemo and wam models apply many physics packages and parameterizations different from those used by other coupled models such as for instance the regional ocean modelling system roms and the simulating waves nearshore swan wave model which are incorporated in the coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport coawst modelling system warner et al 2010 applied in the mediterranean basin e g ricchi et al 2016 2017 from scientific methodological perspective it is fairly important to perform similar experiments with different tools to ensure the generalization of the results and their validity as well moreover this study also presents the novel incorporation of an oceanographic model for the mediterranean explicitly connected to the adjacent black sea considered as a more realistic configuration for the air sea fluxes it is also noteworthy that this study presents a quantitative analysis for the ekman dynamics as opposed to previous qualitative studies e g discussing only the sst drop in more detail we estimated the wind stress curl and its impact on lowering the ocean stratification by increasing the vertical eddy diffusivity coefficient and thus the ekman layer the quantitative analysis estimated also the impact of the wave model further increasing the vertical eddy diffusivity and the ekman dynamics this work unravelled several effects of atmosphere wave ocean feedbacks on the selected medicane yielding valuable findings and also highlighting the importance of using a 3 way coupled modelling system like chaos consequently it is the authors intention to continue the investigation of atmosphere wave ocean interactions during cyclones and longer periods as well as to validate chaos with diverse observational networks so as to improve its performance additionally the direct impact of waves on upper ocean remains to be examined since it modifies ocean circulation vertical mixing surface stress and roughness as well as langmuir turbulence and coriolis stokes force breivik et al 2015 lewis et al 2019 rebalancing atmosphere wave ocean exchanges in particular we are interested on contributions of the coriolis stokes force and modifications brought to the turbulence kinetic energy scheme of nemo based on the langmuir turbulence the design of such an experiment remains to be investigated in

diagram assuming 3 way coupling simulation at the beginning of the coupled run the coupling fields that were exchanged between the models were retrieved from restart files including information from ecmwf analyses for wrf and from 2 month and 1 day pre processing simulations for nemo and wam respectively furthermore during the coupled integration at predefined timesteps coupling timesteps each model received the fields that were estimated by the other models and then sent its coupling fields however at a coupling timestep both models reached the point of executing the receiving process waited for the required fields and stopped any calculation to avoid such deadlock situation the relative order of oasis get and oasis put was changed by introducing the lag concept valcke et al 2015 setting a lag value for one of the models resulted in shifting of the time at which the data was sent but not the time at which the data was received in this case a lag of 1 wrf time step 30 s for wrf was set using this configuration nemo executed oasis get requesting the required fields for its next time step but it received the fields that were produced by the simulation of wrf at wrf timestep exchange timestep lag once wrf had completed the execution of this timestep it sent the fields through oasis put which were then propagated to nemo to continue at this point wrf executed oasis get expecting the required fields from nemo meanwhile having received the required fields to execute its next time step nemo executed its timestep calculating the fields wrf was waiting for and sent the respective data to it using oasis put in this way wrf resumed its execution for the next timestep and so on consequently wrf called oasis get and oasis put at every time step but the fields were exchanged only when wrf time exchange time for oasis get and wrf time exchange time lag for oasis put in contrast to wrf in nemo model the fields were exchanged for both oasis get and oasis put when nemo time exchange time similar was the exchange procedure between wrf and wam and between nemo and wam as shown in fig a 1 more technical information about coupling procedure between wrf and wam for

23958,motivated by recent observations of coherent dipolar cyclone anticyclone structures in the ocean the modons and their signature in the surface temperature field we demonstrate that the classical modon solutions of the barotropic quasi geostrophic equations can be generalized to include buoyancy or temperature as an active tracer the properties of such thermal modons and especially their ability to carry heat anomaly over long distances depend on the relative sign of the associated vorticity and buoyancy anomalies we show using numerical simulations with the thermal shallow water equations and their quasi geostrophic version that the evolution of the modons is consistent with the observations keywords mixed layer vortex dipoles coherent structure 1 introduction mesoscale eddies are ubiquitous features of the ocean circulation and an important component of the ocean energetics and variability ferrari and wunsch 2009 chelton et al 2011 they play an active role in the transport of heat salt and biogeochemical constituents yamamoto et al 2018 sun et al 2019 while isolated eddies drift westward at rather slow speed in the linear regime especially in mid to high latitudes their velocity follows the rossby wave speed non linearities can allow for anomalous propagation velocities chelton et al 2011 among nonlinear mechanisms the pairing of counter rotating vortices can lead to rapid propagation which has an impact on transport properties recently hughes and miller 2017 reported a discovery of long living coherent dipolar structures in the ocean and convincingly associated them with long known modon solutions of the barotropic quasi geostrophic qg equations larichev and reznik 1976 the modons detected in the data evolve on the background of inhomogeneous surface temperature and carry with them for some time temperature anomalies hughes and miller 2017 fig 3 modons are coherent steady moving cyclone anticyclone eddy pairs which capture and transport fluid masses but both the classical larichev and reznik 1976 and more recent kizner et al 2008 ribstein et al 2010 modon theories are essentially barotropic and allow the inclusion of variable temperature and or buoyancy only as passive tracers yet the overall temperature field in the observations does not appear to be perfectly captured by the dipoles this suggests that temperature does not behave as a purely passive tracer and the question of its possible influence on the evolution of the vortex dipoles arises which is the main motivation of this work we recall that there exists a generalization of the classical rotating shallow water rsw model of which the barotropic qg model is a low rossby number limit allowing for inclusion of variable buoyancy as a dynamically active tracer this is the so called thermal shallow water tsw model which was multiply reinvented in the context of the boundary layer in the atmosphere lavoie 1972 salby 1989 and mixed layer in the ocean mccreary et al 1993 young 1994 ripa 1995 and share some similarities with other simplified models of the latter e g szoeke and richman 1984 the qg limit of tsw which we will call tqg was established by warnerford and dellar 2013 the typical rossby number of the modons reported by hughes and miller 2017 was of the order 10 2 considering the global rossby number i e r o u f l where u is the typical velocity and l the typical size of the modon which makes the tqg model a good framework for investigating their dynamics below we extend the classical derivation of the modon solutions to the tqg model and then show with the help of numerical simulations that such solutions exist also in the full tsw model we demonstrate that the properties of thus obtained thermal modons crucially depend on the relative sign of associated vorticity and buoyancy anomalies the evolution of the thermal modons will be shown to be consistent with the observations 2 tsw and tqg models and existence of modon solutions 2 1 equations of motion the tsw model which we will be considering in the f plane approximation the generalization to the beta plane is straightforward can be derived by vertical averaging of the primitive equations under the columnar motion hypothesis e g zeitlin 2018 ch 14 the equations of the model for horizontal velocity v x y z total thickness geopotential height h x y z and total buoyancy b x y z fields read 1 t v v v f z ˆ v b h h 2 b t h v h 0 t b v b 0 where x y both the thickness and buoyancy are positive with a constant horizontally averaged value h b 0 the buoyancy is related to temperature anomaly according to the most frequent interpretation the model describes the active upper layer of the ocean b g ρ 0 ρ ρ 0 where ρ and ρ 0 const are densities of the upper and infinitely deep passive lower layers warnerford and dellar 2013 other interpretations however exist in the oceanic or the atmospheric context zeitlin 2018 see a discussion in section 5 by the standard procedure in the limit of small rossby number the quasi geostrophic limit of these equations is obtained warnerford and dellar 2013 their equations 4 12 a c 2 t 2 ψ ψ b b u j ψ 2 ψ 0 t b j ψ b 0 here the buoyancy b is the anomaly i e b b but we use the same symbol b not to overcharge the notation and the geostrophic streamfunction is ψ b η where η is the thickness anomaly h h these equations are dimensionless in particular x y are non dimensionalized by the typical length scale of the flow l and time t by l u the potential vorticity anomaly in the tqg model is q 2 ψ η b u where b u r d 2 l 2 is the burger number and r d is the rossby deformation radius 2 2 tqg modons we now generalize the classical procedure of construction of the modon solutions larichev and reznik 1976 to the tqg case this solution consists of a dipolar structure with a compact circular support stationary in a frame co moving with a constant non dimensional velocity u and is obtained by assuming a linear relation between the streamfunction and the potential vorticity we thus look for solutions of 2 moving steadily in the zonal direction ψ ψ x u t y b b x u t y whereby t u x in eqs 2 note that u will thus be the propagation speed of the modon which can be different from typical velocities induced by the dipolar structure in this case 3a u x 2 ψ ψ j ψ 2 ψ b 0 3b u x b j ψ b 0 to simplify the formulas above we here further rescaled x y and accordingly u by b u and got rid of b u this implies that length is now measured in units of r d instead of l eq 3b is equivalent to j ψ u

an ordinary derivative of a function of a single variable at this point we make a simplifying hypothesis by assuming that f is a linear function with f κ const in this case the general solution of 4 obeys 5 2 ψ ψ u κ y g ψ u y where g is an arbitrary function as in the classical construction larichev and reznik 1976 we consider this equation in the outer and inner domains separated by a circle of radius r a this parameter defines the typical scale of the flow l and is thus set by the burger number a l 1 b u in units of r d we then suppose that g is a linear function in each of the domains g ψ u y α ψ u y with α const hence 6 2 ψ 1 α ψ u y α κ we further consider solutions with no buoyancy anomaly in the exterior region by setting κ 0 there 2 2 1 external region a decay condition is imposed in the external region ψ r 0 hence from 6 u α 0 α 0 and 7 2 ψ ψ 0 this equation is solved by separation of variables in polar coordinates r θ by anticipating a matching with the inner solution we choose 8 ψ a k 1 r sin θ where a is a constant to be determined and k 1 is the modified bessel function of order 1 2 2 2 internal region the solution in the internal region is sought as a combination ψ ψ ψ with 9 1 α ψ u y α κ 2 ψ 1 α ψ 0 from now on we omit the subscript in κ by anticipating a matching with the outer region the solution is chosen in the form 10 ψ a j 1 λ r u r κ λ 2 1 λ 2 sin θ where a is a constant to be determined j 1 is the bessel function of order 1 and we introduced the notation 1 α λ 2 2 2 3 matching at r a the continuity of the streamfunction across r a in the co moving frame ψ u y ψ u y 0 allows to fix the constants a 11 a u a k 1 a a u a 1 κ λ 2 j 1 λ a the second matching condition at r a r ψ r ψ leads as usual to a transcendental equation allowing to determine λ at a given κ 12 j 1 λ a j 1 λ a 1 λ a 1 λ 2 1 κ λ 1 κ k 1 a k 1 a the lowest root of this equation gives a modon solution the higher roots give so called shielded modons with strongly sheared velocity field the speed u of the modon determines its intensity cf 11 note that apart from the new parameter κ the obtained solution reproduces the velocity field of the classical f plane modon cf ribstein et al 2010 changing the sign of κ leads to a change of the relative sign of circulation and buoyancy anomaly of a given vortex inside the modon thus there exist tqg modons with inner cyclones with positive or negative buoyancy anomaly and vice versa for anticyclones below the former will be called regular and the latter anomalous an example of thickness and buoyancy anomalies of a tqg modon is presented in fig 1 3 evolution of thermal modons as follows from numerical simulations 3 1 typical parameters of observed modons we first resume the typical dynamical parameters estimated from 9 modons reported by hughes and miller 2017 from observations in the southern mid latitude ocean also see their supplementary information for the observed dipolar structures these dynamical parameters are in a narrow range the typical size varies from 100 to 200km in an environment where the first baroclinic deformation radius is about 25km although the vertical extent of the modons is not known we can thus estimate the typical burger number to be 0 015 0 07 the mean propagation velocity of the modons is between 5 and 10cm s sometimes even larger up to 20cm s the corresponding global rossby number u f a as defined in the derivation of the modon solution is thus between 10 3 and 10 2 as we said previously this propagation speed does not reflect the typical velocities induced by the modon which are of order 0 5m s thus corresponding to a global rossby number approximately four times larger while the local rossby number ζ f is 0 1 0 3 as the modons propagate in an environment with a meridional gradient of sea surface temperature sst the patterns of sst anomaly carried by the dipoles which strongly depend on the location of the eddy formation are rather diverse hughes and miller 2017 si nonetheless the temperature difference between the cyclone and the anticyclone varies typically between 0 c when both eddies have roughly the same sst and 2 c in one single case the sst inside the cyclone is higher than in the anticyclone this apparently narrow range of dynamical parameters may be biased by the method of observation which is limited in resolution hence the typical values of burger number above should be considered as a lower bound since smaller and potentially more ageostrophic dipoles may exist in the following we use parameters inferred from one of the modons which was tracked over a long time and had a typical size of 100km and a mean estimated propagation velocity of 8 8cm s the temperature anomaly carried by the modon can be roughly estimated as 2 c the corresponding buoyancy anomaly is therefore b 4 1 0 3 m s2 consistently with these values we first study the evolution of a modon with an initial burger number b u 1 0 1 and κ 0 5 within the tqg model then we extend these results to ageostrophic case using the parent tsw model 3 2 simulations with tqg model to study the evolution of the modon solution derived above we implement the tqg equations 2 with a spectral discretization in a doubly periodic domain of size 8 a and using the open source code dedalus burns et al 2020 a laplacian viscosity diffusivity for the momentum and the buoyancy with a non dimensional value of 10 6 is added to limit grid scale oscillations time stepping is performed using a third order 4 step implicit explicit runge kutta scheme we use 512 fourier modes in each direction and a dealiasing factor of 3 2 e g canuto et al 2006 burns et al 2020 the evolution with positive and negative κ strongly differ in the case of an anomalous buoyancy perturbation negative κ no noticeable change of shape of the modon is observed over the duration of the simulation which was 50 in non dimensional time units not shown this is an indication that such modon is a stable solution of the tqg equations at least over time scales of a few months for typical rossby numbers of o 1 0 2 the evolution of the stream function potential vorticity and buoyancy of a regular modon positive κ is presented in fig 2 contrary to the anomalous modon the regular modon rapidly develops a small scale instability of the kind observed in gouzien et al 2017b this convective type instability leads to a complete mixing of the buoyancy field after some time the instability generates small scale disturbances in the buoyancy field as previously reported in the case of isolated vortices in the tsw model gouzien et al 2017b in the case of a planar jet the same kind of instability in tsw model is dominated by even smaller wavenumbers than for the vortices unpublished results see also a discussion in the tqg case below which is consistent with the dynamics observed in the present configuration remarkably the vorticity field keeps its coherence leading at the late stages of the evolution to a steady modon with quasi neutral buoyancy the destruction of the buoyancy anomaly carried by the modon and the limited modification of the modon s dynamical core are illustrated in fig 3 where the evolution of the tqg energy cf warnerford and dellar 2013 the buoyancy variance and the speed of propagation of both regular and anomalous modons are shown as seen in the figure the instability triggers a decrease of buoyancy variance and enhances the energy dissipation which nevertheless remains weak the propagation velocity of the modon is also affected exhibiting a slight decrease in course of the development of the instability on the contrary in the case of the anomalous modon all these fields energy buoyancy variance and propagation speed remain practically constant during the whole simulation this means that the decrease of energy and buoyancy variance is due to the instability and that dissipation has a negligible impact on the evolution of the modon itself the buoyancy variance was integrated over the whole domain continuous line and over the modon area only circle of non dimensional radius 1 dashed lines and divided by the area of the modon the difference between the dashed and continuous curves is an indicator of buoyancy variance that is expunged from the modon showing that mixing of buoyancy and other tracers across the edge of the dipole occurs in course of destabilization the above results suggest that most of the buoyancy anomaly is dissipated locally i e inside the modon while a smaller albeit not negligible portion of it is expunged in the form of small anomalies not captured by the color bar resolution in the corresponding snapshots in fig 2 right column and then rapidly eliminated by diffusion because of the very small scales associated with the development of the instability the details of the ratio of interior dissipation vs expulsion are sensitive to the numerical resolution the same run was repeated with 1024 fourier modes and the value of the diffusivity used although the results remain qualitatively the same and are confirmed in full tsw model below higher dissipation inhibits the development of the instability resulting in a slower decrease of the buoyancy variance and a smaller portion of buoyancy expulsion a decrease of buoyancy mixing is observed also for the higher resolution indicating a slow numerical convergence indeed the buoyancy variance spectrum not shown is nearly flat at high wavenumbers down to the numerical resolution cutoff and probably a more sophisticated parameterization of the horizontal mixing should be used to allow for more quantitative diagnostics nonetheless this result has important implications for the transport properties of such coherent structures which are usually characterized by their ability to isolate inner water masses from their environment and transport them over long distances here the instability provides a pathway for the exchange of water between the modon and its environment and associated reduction of the heat anomaly although detailed investigations of parameter regimes and case studies are out of the scope of the paper we should mention that simulations of anomalous modons with κ 1 show destabilization similar to that of regular modons 3 3 simulations with full tsw model a natural question is whether the described tqg modon solutions sustain the ageostrophic corrections in other words do ageostrophic tsw modons exist as it is the case with ordinary rsw modons using the strategy of 15 we initialized numerical simulations in the full tsw model 1 with the tqg modon profiles of velocity buoyancy and thickness anomalies as constructed above and looked whether such initial conditions adjust to a coherent tsw structure following 6 the simulations were performed with a second order centered finite difference shallow water scheme sadourny 1975 which was extended to tsw by adding the corresponding terms in the momentum equations and an upwind biased finite volume buoyancy transport scheme an explicit minimal newtonian viscosity was added to the equations of the model 1 in order to regularize very small scale structures which can be produced by convective type instabilities in trsw gouzien et al 2017b the values we used were ν 1 0 3 with the precise value of ν having no global impact on the major features of the evolution of the modons typical results from the simulations are presented in fig 4 the rossby and burger numbers of the initial tqg modons were 0 1 and 1 respectively as in the pure rsw case ribstein et al 2010 corresponding to κ 0 after a period of initial adjustment the qg modon sheds a part of cyclonic vorticity loses its initial cyclone anticyclone symmetry and as a consequence starts moving along the curved trajectory in the case where the cyclonic part is associated with positive anomaly of b i e negative values of the parameter κ anomalous modon the dipole keeps it coherence for a long time as in the non thermal rsw case on the contrary in the opposite case the regular modon undergoes a convective type instability as in the tqg simulations above which leads to a complete mixing of the buoyancy field the instability acts more vigorously in the cyclone as visible in the second row of fig 4 right panel thus resulting in a slightly asymmetric distribution of buoyancy in the final dipole different stages in both cases are visualized in fig 4 and the final or adjusted modons in both stable and unstable cases are presented in fig 5 4 jet and vortex instability in the tqg model as discussed above the instability observed in the modon is small scale the difference in stability properties of the vortices depending on the sign of the buoyancy anomaly relative to vorticity anomaly could be anticipated in view of our previous results on the stability of monopolar vortices in the tsw model gouzien et al 2017b where we found the same dependence moreover the fact that the instability is more vigorous in the cyclone in the tsw model agrees with the observation of 6 that for the same range of parameters rossby and burger numbers the cyclones were more unstable than anticyclones the modons are pairs of opposite sign vortices whose interaction gives rise to an intense jet between them on the central axis e g lahaye and zeitlin 2012b to get more insight on the instability of the modon in the tqg model and its implications we investigated the evolution of jets and vortices in the tqg model in similar dynamical regimes initial profiles are constructed from the potential vorticity and buoyancy fields of the modon in the case of the jet the pv and buoyancy profiles are taken from the modon solution at its center at x 0 and replicated along the x axis and the pv equation in cartesian coordinates which depends on the y coordinate only is inverted to obtain the pressure field for the vortex we fit the pv profile of one pole at y 0 and along the line x 0 to a gaussian bump cut from below q exp x δ 2 exp a 2 δ 2 r a 2 where δ is the fitting parameter and q 0 for r a then we invert the pv equation in polar coordinates the corresponding equation depends on the radius r only while imposing the buoyancy field to be proportional to this initial pv an additional outer ring of weak negative pv anomaly is added in order to shut the far field circulation dynamical parameters are the same as for the tqg modon b u 0 1 κ 0 5 additional runs with larger values of κ were also conducted to better illustrate the instability mechanism we first studied the linear stability of the jet the stability diagram which we do not present reveals the standard barotropic instability at synoptic along jet wave numbers typically around k 2 as expected given the alternating sign of the pv profile e g poulin and flierl 2003 in addition for κ 0 a small scale instability strongly localized at the center of the jet in y direction and with a pronounced signature on the buoyancy field is observed for κ 0 only the barotropic instability was found in the range of investigated along jet wavenumbers 1 19 the growth rate of the small scale instability increases with the wavenumber which supports the very small scale character of the instability observed for the modons these results are again in agreement with previous findings in the tsw model gouzien et al 2017a the nonlinear evolution of this instability is investigated by means of numerical simulations in the tqg model by using the background jet with superimposed unstable mode of small amplitude as initial conditions the results of such simulations are presented for κ 0 5 and κ 2 in fig 6 left columns the initial stage of the instability reflects the structure of the linear unstable mode it then exhibits a very rapid development resulting in fast mixing of the buoyancy while the latter remains localized near the central axis of the jet for κ 0 5 it develops and mixes buoyancy over a much larger region for larger values of κ κ 2 as shown in the figure bottom rows and additional experiment with κ 5 not shown further confirms this behavior the instability of vortices was investigated by superposing a weak random noise with a relative magnitude of 2 as well as the most linearly unstable mode found for azimuthal wavenumber l 8 with an even weaker amplitude onto the initial buoyancy field in the initial conditions results from the linear stability analysis are difficult to discuss independently because of the presence of critical layers giving rise to pseudo modes and would need further dedicated work we thus rely mostly on the nonlinear simulations in the present paper presented in fig 6 right columns the vortex develops an instability very similar to the one reported by gouzien et al 2017b in the tsw model while the vortex with negative κ remains stable over the same duration not shown this instability is not as vigorous as in the jet configuration and generate moderate mixing of buoyancy which increases with the magnitude of the initial buoyancy profile these results thus show that the instability of the modon described in the previous section is consistent with the instabilities observed in a jet or a monopolar vortex in the tqg model the details of the properties of the instability and its physical origin remain to be fully understood which is left for future work 5 discussion we thus demonstrated the existence of modons coherent dipolar vortices in a model of the mixed layer of the ocean with variable buoyancy acting as an active tracer and contributing to pressure variations depending on the relative orientation of circulation and buoyancy anomaly the latter is either carried along the trajectory of the modon or dissipated the dissipation of buoyancy anomaly is due to small scale convective type instability which is not proper uniquely to the modons but manifests itself also for jets and monopolar vortices with the same relative sign of vorticity and buoyancy anomalies these results were obtained both in the parent model namely the tsw equations where ageostrophic effects are present and give rise to cyclone anticyclone asymmetry that affects the trajectory and the details of the development of the instability for the anomalous modon as well as in the qg limit of this model we should stress at this point that the physical meaning of the results depends on the interpretation of the tsw model and the qg limit if it is understood as being purely barotropic and is obtained by vertical averaging through the whole depth zeitlin 2018 ch 14 then b g ρ ρ 0 where ρ and ρ 0 are the variable and constant parts of water density respectively this means that b decreases with temperature if the model is understood as describing the baroclinic motions in the two layer ocean with infinitely deep lower layer as in 21 then b g ρ 0 ρ ρ 0 where ρ and ρ 0 const are densities of the upper and lower layers i e b increases with temperature as can be inferred from the observations hughes and miller 2017 the anticyclone the observations are in the southern hemisphere carries for some time a positive temperature anomaly it seems plausible although this is not proved that the observed dipoles are surface intensified in this case the second interpretation is appropriate and observations correspond to the unstable case however with the realistic parameters roughly corresponding to those in the observations which were used in the tqg simulations the time of mixing of the buoyancy perturbation is several months we should recall that non dimensional time and real time are related through the factor r o 1 this typical timescale for the elimination of the heat anomaly actually matches the observations reported in hughes and miller 2017 fig 3 where the dipole loses its temperature anomaly and exhibit entrainment of temperature anomaly from the exterior among other possibilities such as interactions with an inhomogeneous environment and exterior shear strain the instability revealed in our simulations could be responsible for this observed behavior let us finally mention that the known modon solutions in two layer qg and rsw models e g 9 can be generalized to the thermal counterparts of both models along the same lines as above yet in order to compare such solutions with

23958,motivated by recent observations of coherent dipolar cyclone anticyclone structures in the ocean the modons and their signature in the surface temperature field we demonstrate that the classical modon solutions of the barotropic quasi geostrophic equations can be generalized to include buoyancy or temperature as an active tracer the properties of such thermal modons and especially their ability to carry heat anomaly over long distances depend on the relative sign of the associated vorticity and buoyancy anomalies we show using numerical simulations with the thermal shallow water equations and their quasi geostrophic version that the evolution of the modons is consistent with the observations keywords mixed layer vortex dipoles coherent structure 1 introduction mesoscale eddies are ubiquitous features of the ocean circulation and an important component of the ocean energetics and variability ferrari and wunsch 2009 chelton et al 2011 they play an active role in the transport of heat salt and biogeochemical constituents yamamoto et al 2018 sun et al 2019 while isolated eddies drift westward at rather slow speed in the linear regime especially in mid to high latitudes their velocity follows the rossby wave speed non linearities can allow for anomalous propagation velocities chelton et al 2011 among nonlinear mechanisms the pairing of counter rotating vortices can lead to rapid propagation which has an impact on transport properties recently hughes and miller 2017 reported a discovery of long living coherent dipolar structures in the ocean and convincingly associated them with long known modon solutions of the barotropic quasi geostrophic qg equations larichev and reznik 1976 the modons detected in the data evolve on the background of inhomogeneous surface temperature and carry with them for some time temperature anomalies hughes and miller 2017 fig 3 modons are coherent steady moving cyclone anticyclone eddy pairs which capture and transport fluid masses but both the classical larichev and reznik 1976 and more recent kizner et al 2008 ribstein et al 2010 modon theories are essentially barotropic and allow the inclusion of variable temperature and or buoyancy only as passive tracers yet the overall temperature field in the observations does not appear to be perfectly captured by the dipoles this suggests that temperature does not behave as a purely passive tracer and the question of its possible influence on the evolution of the vortex dipoles arises which is the main motivation of this work we recall that there exists a generalization of the classical rotating shallow water rsw model of which the barotropic qg model is a low rossby number limit allowing for inclusion of variable buoyancy as a dynamically active tracer this is the so called thermal shallow water tsw model which was multiply reinvented in the context of the boundary layer in the atmosphere lavoie 1972 salby 1989 and mixed layer in the ocean mccreary et al 1993 young 1994 ripa 1995 and share some similarities with other simplified models of the latter e g szoeke and richman 1984 the qg limit of tsw which we will call tqg was established by warnerford and dellar 2013 the typical rossby number of the modons reported by hughes and miller 2017 was of the order 10 2 considering the global rossby number i e r o u f l where u is the typical velocity and l the typical size of the modon which makes the tqg model a good framework for investigating their dynamics below we extend the classical derivation of the modon solutions to the tqg model and then show with the help of numerical simulations that such solutions exist also in the full tsw model we demonstrate that the properties of thus obtained thermal modons crucially depend on the relative sign of associated vorticity and buoyancy anomalies the evolution of the thermal modons will be shown to be consistent with the observations 2 tsw and tqg models and existence of modon solutions 2 1 equations of motion the tsw model which we will be considering in the f plane approximation the generalization to the beta plane is straightforward can be derived by vertical averaging of the primitive equations under the columnar motion hypothesis e g zeitlin 2018 ch 14 the equations of the model for horizontal velocity v x y z total thickness geopotential height

the buoyancy is related to temperature anomaly according to the most frequent interpretation the model describes the active upper layer of the ocean b g ρ 0 ρ ρ 0 where ρ and ρ 0 const are densities of the upper and infinitely deep passive lower layers warnerford and dellar 2013 other interpretations however exist in the oceanic or the atmospheric context zeitlin 2018 see a discussion in section

t b j ψ b 0 here the buoyancy b is the anomaly i e b b but we use the same symbol b not to overcharge the notation and the geostrophic streamfunction is ψ b η where η is the thickness anomaly h h these equations are dimensionless in particular x y are non dimensionalized by the typical length scale of the flow l and time t by l u the potential vorticity anomaly in the tqg model is q 2 ψ η b u where b u r d 2 l 2 is the burger number and r d is the rossby deformation radius 2 2 tqg modons we now generalize the classical procedure of construction of the modon solutions larichev and reznik 1976 to the tqg case this solution consists of a dipolar structure with a compact circular support stationary in a frame co moving with a constant non dimensional velocity u and is obtained by assuming a linear relation between the streamfunction and the potential vorticity we thus look for solutions of 2 moving steadily in the zonal direction ψ ψ x u t y b b x u t y whereby t u x in eqs 2 note that u will thus be the propagation speed of the modon which can be different from typical velocities induced by the dipolar structure in this case 3a u x 2 ψ ψ j ψ 2 ψ b 0 3b u x b j ψ b 0 to simplify the formulas above we here further rescaled x y and accordingly u by b u and got rid of b u this implies that length is now measured in units of r d instead of l eq 3b is equivalent to j ψ u

an ordinary derivative of a function of a single variable at this point we make a simplifying hypothesis by assuming that f is a linear function with f κ const in this case the general solution of 4 obeys 5 2 ψ ψ u κ y g ψ u y where g is an arbitrary function as in the classical construction larichev and reznik 1976 we consider this equation in the outer and inner domains separated by a circle of radius r a this parameter defines the typical scale of the flow l and is thus set by the burger number a l 1 b u in units of r d we then suppose that g is a linear function in each of the domains g ψ u y α ψ u y with α const hence 6 2 ψ 1 α ψ u y α κ we further consider solutions with no buoyancy anomaly in the exterior region by setting κ 0 there 2 2 1 external region a decay condition is imposed in the external region ψ r 0 hence from 6 u α 0 α 0 and 7 2 ψ ψ 0 this equation is solved by separation of variables in polar coordinates r θ by anticipating a matching with the inner solution we choose 8 ψ a k 1 r sin θ where a is a constant to be determined and k 1 is the modified bessel function of order 1 2 2 2 internal region the solution in the internal region is sought as a combination ψ ψ ψ with 9 1 α ψ u y α κ 2 ψ 1 α ψ 0 from now on we omit the subscript in κ by anticipating a matching with the outer region the solution is chosen in the form 10 ψ a j 1 λ r u r κ λ 2 1 λ 2 sin θ where a is a constant to be determined j 1 is the bessel function of order 1 and we introduced the notation 1 α λ 2 2 2 3 matching at r a the continuity of the streamfunction across r a in the co moving frame ψ u y ψ u y 0 allows to fix the constants a 11 a u a k 1 a a u a 1 κ λ 2 j 1 λ a the second matching condition at r a r ψ r ψ leads as usual to a transcendental equation allowing to

sheared velocity field the speed u of the modon determines its intensity cf 11 note that apart from the new parameter κ the obtained solution reproduces the velocity field of the classical f plane modon cf ribstein et al 2010 changing the sign of κ leads to a change of the relative sign of circulation and buoyancy anomaly of a given vortex inside the modon thus there exist tqg modons with inner cyclones with positive or negative buoyancy anomaly and vice versa for anticyclones below the former will be called regular and the latter anomalous an example of thickness and buoyancy anomalies of a tqg modon is presented in fig 1 3 evolution of thermal modons as follows from numerical simulations 3 1 typical parameters of observed modons we first resume the typical dynamical parameters estimated from 9 modons reported by hughes and miller 2017 from observations in the southern mid latitude ocean also see their supplementary information for the observed dipolar structures these dynamical parameters are in a narrow range the typical size varies from 100 to 200km in an environment where the first baroclinic deformation radius is about 25km although the vertical extent of the modons is not known we can thus estimate the typical burger number to be 0 015 0 07 the mean propagation velocity of the modons is between 5 and 10cm s sometimes even larger up to 20cm s the corresponding global rossby number u f a as defined in the derivation of the modon solution is thus between 10 3 and 10 2 as we said previously this propagation speed does not reflect the typical velocities induced by the modon which are of order 0 5m s thus corresponding to a global rossby number approximately four times larger while the local rossby number ζ f is 0 1 0 3 as the modons propagate in an environment with a meridional gradient of sea surface temperature sst the patterns of sst anomaly carried by the dipoles which strongly depend on the location of the eddy formation are rather diverse hughes and miller 2017 si nonetheless the temperature difference between the cyclone and the anticyclone varies typically between 0 c when both eddies have roughly the same sst and 2 c in one single case the sst inside the cyclone is higher than in the anticyclone this apparently narrow range of dynamical parameters may be biased by the method of observation which is limited in resolution hence the typical values of burger number above should be considered as a lower bound since smaller and potentially more ageostrophic dipoles may exist in the following we use parameters inferred from one of the modons which was tracked over a long time and had a typical size of 100km and a mean estimated propagation velocity of 8 8cm s the temperature anomaly carried by the modon can be roughly estimated as 2 c the corresponding buoyancy anomaly is therefore b 4 1 0 3 m s2 consistently with these values we first study the evolution of a modon with an initial burger number b u 1 0 1 and κ 0 5 within the tqg model then we extend these results to ageostrophic case using the parent tsw model 3 2 simulations with tqg model to study the evolution of the modon solution derived above we implement the tqg equations 2 with a spectral discretization in a doubly periodic domain of size 8 a and using the open source code dedalus burns et al 2020 a laplacian viscosity diffusivity for the momentum and the buoyancy with a non dimensional value of 10 6 is added to limit grid scale oscillations time stepping is performed using a third order 4 step implicit explicit runge kutta scheme we use 512 fourier modes in each direction and a dealiasing factor of 3 2 e g canuto et al 2006 burns et al 2020 the evolution with positive and negative κ strongly differ in the case of an anomalous buoyancy perturbation negative κ no noticeable change of shape of the modon is observed over the duration of the simulation which was 50 in non dimensional time units not shown this is an indication that such modon is a stable solution of the tqg equations at least over time scales of a few months for typical rossby numbers of o 1 0 2 the evolution of the stream function potential vorticity and buoyancy of a regular modon positive κ is presented in fig 2 contrary to the anomalous modon the regular modon rapidly develops a small scale instability of the kind observed in gouzien et al 2017b this convective type instability leads to a complete mixing of the buoyancy field after some time the instability generates small scale disturbances in the buoyancy field as previously reported in the case of isolated vortices in the tsw model gouzien et al 2017b in the case of a planar jet the same kind of instability in tsw model is dominated by even smaller wavenumbers than for the vortices unpublished results see also a discussion in the tqg case below which is consistent with the dynamics observed in the present configuration remarkably the vorticity field keeps its coherence leading at the late stages of the evolution to a steady modon with quasi neutral buoyancy the destruction of the buoyancy anomaly carried by the modon and the limited modification of the modon s dynamical core are illustrated in fig 3 where the evolution of the tqg energy cf warnerford and dellar 2013 the buoyancy variance and the speed of propagation of both regular and anomalous modons are shown as seen in the figure the instability triggers a decrease of buoyancy variance and enhances the energy dissipation which nevertheless remains weak the propagation velocity of the modon is also affected exhibiting a slight decrease in course of the development of the instability on the contrary in the case of the anomalous modon all these fields energy buoyancy variance and propagation speed remain practically constant during the whole simulation this means that the decrease of energy and buoyancy variance is due to the instability and that dissipation has a negligible impact on the evolution of the modon itself the buoyancy variance was integrated over the whole domain continuous line and over the modon area only circle of non dimensional radius 1 dashed lines and divided by the area of the modon the difference between the dashed and continuous curves is an indicator of buoyancy variance that is expunged from the modon showing that mixing of buoyancy and other tracers across the edge of the dipole occurs in course of destabilization the above results suggest that most of the buoyancy anomaly is dissipated locally i e inside the modon while a smaller albeit not negligible portion of it is expunged in the form of small anomalies not captured by the color bar resolution in the corresponding snapshots in fig 2 right column and then rapidly eliminated by diffusion because of the very small scales associated with the development of the instability the details of the ratio of interior dissipation vs expulsion are sensitive to the numerical resolution the same run was repeated with 1024 fourier modes and the value of the diffusivity used although the results remain qualitatively the same and are confirmed in full tsw model below higher dissipation inhibits the development of the instability resulting in a slower decrease of the buoyancy variance and a smaller portion of buoyancy expulsion a decrease of buoyancy mixing is observed also for the higher resolution indicating a slow numerical convergence indeed the buoyancy variance spectrum not shown is nearly flat at high wavenumbers down to the numerical resolution cutoff and probably a more sophisticated parameterization of the horizontal mixing should be used to allow for more quantitative diagnostics nonetheless this result has important implications for the transport properties of such coherent structures which are usually characterized by their ability to isolate inner water masses from their environment and transport them over long distances here the instability provides a pathway for the exchange of water between the modon and its environment and associated reduction of the heat anomaly although detailed investigations of parameter regimes and case studies are out of the scope of the paper we should mention that simulations of anomalous modons with κ 1 show destabilization similar to that of regular modons 3 3 simulations with full tsw model a natural question is whether the described tqg modon solutions sustain the ageostrophic corrections in other words do ageostrophic tsw modons exist as it is the case with ordinary rsw modons using the strategy of 15 we initialized numerical simulations

observations reported in hughes and miller 2017 fig 3 where the dipole loses its temperature anomaly and exhibit entrainment of temperature anomaly from the exterior among other possibilities such as interactions with an inhomogeneous environment and exterior shear strain the instability revealed in our simulations could be responsible for this observed behavior let us finally mention that the

23959,self similarity power laws of wind wave growth describe idealized cases of fetch limited and duration limited conditions in this paper a generalized view on wave growth in these two cases is discussed a parametric model describing uniformly fetch and duration limited development of wind waves is suggested the key assumption of the model is the universality of the self similar shape of wave spectra for both fetch and duration limited conditions the model justifies the conversion of the data collected at fetch limited conditions to the data corresponding to duration limited growth and determines the power law constants of duration limited growth from the fetch limited constants this general view on wave growth is validated against the experimental data reported previously and wave gauge data obtained at the black sea research platform as demonstrated the model tuned through fetch limited data is also consistent with the field data that correspond to the duration limited conditions possible applications of the suggested parametric model are briefly highlighted keywords wind driven waves fetch and duration limited wave growth laws wind wave parametric model in situ wind wave measurements similarity of the wave spectra shape 1 introduction power laws of wave development based on ideas of self similarity suggested by kitaigorodskii 1962 1970 were originally developed for two idealized cases fetch limited and duration limited conditions in the first case the laws describe dependences of energy and spectral peak frequency on the fetch when waves are generated by stationary offshore wind in the second case the laws describe the time evolution of waves generated by the uniform wind field in the infinite horizontal space the fetch limited cases have been extensively studied empirically e g hasselmann et al 1973 donelan et al 1985 dobson et al 1989 kahma and calkoen 1992 babanin and soloviev 1998 young 1999 in contrast field studies of duration limited wave growth are very scarce an example of such unique data was reported by hwang and wang 2004 due to the lack of empirical data on the duration limited wave development heuristic equations to convert fetch limited data to duration limited have been proposed bretschneider 1952 mitsuyasu and rikiishi 1978 young 1999 hwang and wang 2004 a key parameter of these heuristic equations is the effective group velocity for a narrow band wave spectrum this velocity is close to the group velocity of the spectral peak however its definition for a wide spectrum is not obvious and different in various papers compare e g definitions of mitsuyasu and rikiishi 1978 and hwang and wang 2004 in the context of the problem of time development of waves from the state of rest in the coastal zone under the offshore wind the effective group velocity determines the travel velocity of the front separating two regions of different wave growth types located near the coast fetch limited development and in the open sea duration limited development sverdrup and munk 1946 kitaigorodskii 1962 mitsuyasu and rikiishi 1978 massel 2015 both fetch and duration limited asymptotic solutions exist simultaneously far from the front implying that their power laws constants are interconnected basing on the conversion equation this connection was specified by hwang and wang 2004 as equations that allow calculating parameters of the duration limited laws from the parameters of the fetch limited laws kudryavtsev et al 2015 derived the same equations considering the evolution of energy around the spectral peak despite the uncertainty in determining the effective group velocity the implications of the above considerations are reasonably consistent with experimental data bretschneider 1952 young 1999 hwang and wang 2004 hwang 2006 kudryavtsev et al 2015 therefore it is tempting to generalize these results within a physical framework ideas of kitaigorodskii 1962 1970 on the wave spectra self similarity proved in the framework of the weak turbulence wave theory zakharov 2005 zakharov et al 2015 2019 badulin et al 2005 2007 gagnaire renou et al 2011 provide a basis for such developments the main goal of this paper is to suggest a parametric model describing uniformly fetch and duration limited development of wind waves this model is an extension of the parametric model suggested by hasselmann et al 1976 using the weakly turbulent results drawn separately for both wave growth regimes the experimental data by babanin and soloviev 1998 hwang and wang 2004 and wave gauge data taken from the black sea research platform are used to validate the model capability and to demonstrate the interconnection of wind wave growth at duration and fetch limited conditions the paper is organized as follows the formulation of the parametric model and its important consequences are considered in section 2 in section 3 we describe the measurements taken from the platform and suggest a method for selection from wave gauge records time intervals where wave development corresponds to the duration limited growth in section 4 we validate our approach using experimental data in section 5 the results are discussed and summarized 2 model approach 2 1 basic equations of the parametric model the similarity theory suggests a description of the wave growth in a form of power laws kitaigorodskii 1962 1970 hasselmann et al 1973 1a ξ ξ 0 τ q 1b ε ε 0 τ p 2a ξ ξ 0 x χ q x 2b ε ε 0 x χ p x where ε e g 2 u 4 ξ f p u g τ t g u χ x g u 2 are the dimensionless wave energy peak frequency time from the beginning of the wave development and fetch from the shore line respectively e is the variance of the sea surface displacement referenced traditionally as the energy which in turn defines the significant wave height as h s 4 e f p is the spectral peak frequency 2 π ξ is the inverse wave age f p is traditionally defined in hz u is the wind speed and g is the gravity acceleration these power laws describe idealized cases the duration limited wave growth in infinite ocean 1a 1b and the fetch limited stationary wave growth 2a 2b for both cases the dimensionless peak frequency and wave energy are linked by 3 ε a ξ γ a ε 0 ξ 0 γ γ p q 4 ε a x ξ γ x a x ε 0 x ξ 0 x γ x γ x p x q x the parametric model of space time evolution of the wave energy suggested by hasselmann et al 1976 follows from the kinetic equation see their equation 3 1 integrated over all directions θ and frequencies f 5 e t v e x s n l s i n s d i s s d ϑ d f where e s f ϑ d ϑ d f s f ϑ is the directional frequency spectrum of waves v is the weighted group velocity defined for deep water by 6 v g cos ϑ s f ϑ d ϑ d f f 4 π s f ϑ d ϑ d f terms in the right hand side of 5 describe non linear wave wave interactions s n l energy input from the wind s i n and energy dissipation s d i s s following hasselmann et al 1973 we assume that during wave evolution either in space or time the wave spectrum obeys the following universal shape 7 s f ϑ α f η ϑ η f f p where f is a universal function α is a function dependent on time or space coordinate and wind speed then using 6 and 7 the weighted group velocity can be written as 8 v g r 4 π f p r cos ϑ f η ϑ d ϑ d η η f η ϑ d ϑ d η assuming a universal spectrum shape 7 zakharov 2005 badulin et al 2005 2007 and zakharov et al 2015 2019 justified that the right hand side of eq 5 is a universal function of f p and e for both fetch limited and duration limited cases generalizing their findings after scaling of eq 5 with u and g we arrive at 9 ε τ r 4 π ξ ε χ φ e ξ ε this equation must describe both the duration limited 1 and the fetch limited 2 wave growth cases hence the right hand side of 9 can be found by substituting the laws 1b or 2b into the left hand side taking into account 3 and 4 the source function in 9 reduces to the single variable function of ε or ξ as a result there are 4 possible representations for the source function φ e ξ ε in 9 10a φ e p ε 0 1 p ε 1 1 p 10b φ e p a ξ 0 1 q ξ 1 p q 10c φ e r 4 π p x ε 0 x 1 p x a x q x p x ε 1 q x 1 p x 10d φ e r 4 π p x a x ξ 0 x 1 q x ξ 1 p x 1 q x these functions match each other only if the following relationships are fulfilled 11 q q x 1 q x p p x 1 q x ξ 0 ξ 0 x 4 π ξ 0 x r 1 q x q ε 0 ε 0 x 4 π ξ 0 x r 1 q x p notice that similar relationships were derived by hwang and wang 2004 see also hwang 2006 hwang et al 2011 using different approaches based on a heuristic argumentation if the set of eqs 11 is fulfilled then the power laws ε ξ for fetch and duration limited growth 3 and 4 become identical substituting ε a ξ γ into 9 we arrived at the equivalent version of eq 9 expressed in terms of wave age kudryavtsev et al 2015 12 ξ τ r 4 π ξ ξ χ φ f ε ξ the source function φ f ε ξ in 12 has also four representations 13a φ f q ξ 0 ε 0 q 1 p ε q 1 p 13b φ f q ξ 0 1 q ξ 1 1 q 13c φ f r 4 π q x ξ 0 x 1 q x a x 1 p x ε 1 p x 13d φ f r 4 π q x ξ 0 x 1 q x ξ 1 q x which similar to 10 match each other if relations 11 are fulfilled thus eqs 9 and 10 or eqs 12 and 13 along with eq 3 constitute a simple parametric model that generalizes classical growth rate laws 1 and 2 for cases of wave development in space or time two important consequences follow from this model relationships between dimensionless energy and wave age ε ξ defined by 3 and 4 for the duration and fetch limited conditions are identical γ γ x a a x eight parameters of the power laws for wave growth in time 1 and in space 2 are not independent but linked by the four relationships 11 hence the parameters of fetch limited power laws can be recalculated into parameters of duration limited power laws and vice versa it is worth noting that badulin et al 2005 2007 and zakharov et al 2015 2019 have found magic relations between exponents in power laws of wave growth in time 2 p 9 q 1 and in space 2 p x 10 q x 1 it is easy to check that relationships 11 provide equivalence of the magic relations in space and in time substituting 11 into one of them we come exactly to another 2 2 application of the model to data analysis since power laws for the fetch and duration limited wave growth cases are interrelated there should be an equation converting the data from one case to another an appropriate relationship between τ and χ can be introduced in two ways equating 1b and 2b and keeping ε unchanged or equating 1a and 2a and keeping ξ unchanged however if 11 is fulfilled both ways lead to the same result 14 τ 4 π ξ 0 x r 1 q x χ 1 q x notice that similar equations were derived earlier by bretschneider 1952 khandekar 1989 and hwang and wang 2004 with the use of heuristic statement t 0 x d x g x where g is close to the spectral peak group velocity this relation is consistent with 14 if g corresponds to the weighted group velocity defined by 8 i e if g v in the case of wave development from a coast starting from the state of rest at t 0 the regions of duration and fetch limited wave growth exist simultaneously separated by a moving front located at χ χ f τ kitaigorodskii 1962 mitsuyasu and rikiishi 1978 massel 2015 within the framework of the simple parametric model this problem has the solution 1 for 0 χ χ f τ and the solution 2 for χ χ f τ relation describing the evolution of the front is χ f r 1 q x 4 π ξ 0 x τ 1 1 q x the dimensionless advance velocity of the front is c f d χ f d τ r 4 π ξ 0 τ q which corresponds to the weighted group velocity 8 this can be easily justified using 11 and 1a for practical use of the model parameters of the power laws must be specified further as the reference parameters we use that proposed by babanin and soloviev 1998 for the fetch limited conditions 15a q x 0 275 0 16 ξ 0 x 2 4 1 0 18 0 19 γ 3 01 0 17 a 8 30 1 90 2 46 1 0 6 hereinafter double standard error is shown as a 95 confidence interval e g bendat and piersol 2010 then using 4 parameters p x and ε 0 x are equal to p x 0 828 ε 0 x 5 88 10 7 as argued by badulin et al 2007 this set of parameters closely corresponds to the wave growth parameters following from the weak turbulence theory it is also worth noting that parameters 15a were derived from the field data collected at the same site as the present data the value of r for a typical jonswap type spectrum is about 0 7 0 8 yefimov and babanin 1991 hwang and wang 2004 zakharov et al 2015 and for the sake of definiteness we further assign r as 15b r 0 76 these constants prescribe according to 11 the following constants of duration limited power laws 15c q 0 379 ξ 0 11 0 p 1 14 ε 0 6 02 1 0 9 3 experimental data 3 1 measurement technique the data were collected in 2011 2013 from the black sea research platform near the village of katsiveli the platform is located about 500 m off shore in about 30 m deep water see fig 1 for offshore winds the fetch can easily be determined as the along wind distance from the platform to coastline the wave studies performed from the platform were reported previously e g by babanin and soloviev 1998 leckler et al 2015 and shokurov et al 2016 in this study we used archived wave records to select cases of wave development the surface waves were measured using an array of string wave gauges see fig 1 the wave records were sampled with a frequency of 10 hz the wind speed and direction at height of 21 m air temperature and humidity at height of 19 m and temperature in the upper meter of water were measured permanently with averaging over 1 5 min from the platform using davis meteorological station the wind speed at 10 m height and friction velocity were calculated according to the algorithm of fairall et al 2003 a detailed description of the instrumentation is given by shokurov et al 2016 the wave data were processed in a conventional way earle 1996 using the method of heave slope triplet analysis longuet higgins et al 1963 kuik et al 2002 krogstad 2005 the surface elevations from the 6 wave sensors were least square approximated by a plane to obtain the time series of wave elevation and two wave slopes corresponding to triplet measurements from wave buoys frequency wave spectra were calculated from twenty minute intervals the peak frequency f p of the frequency spectra s f s f ϑ d ϑ was determined with an accuracy of 0 01 hz wave energy was obtained by integrating the spectrum s f over 0 7 3 f p the mean wave direction defined as φ m atan b 1 a 1 was estimated directly from triplet analysis spectral representation s f θ s f π 1 2 a 1 cos θ b 1 sin θ longuet higgins et al 1963 3 2 dataset our measurement data are partitioned into two subsets corresponding to waves coming from the coast subset 1 and the open sea subset 2 only measurements collected at stationary winds were used see appendix a for subset 2 only cases of gradually developing waves were selected as argued by kahma and calkoen 1992 hanson and phillips 1999 ardhuin et al 2007 romero and melville 2010 and others a presence of swell of moderate amplitude does not significantly impact dynamics of wave development however a swell may distort the estimate of wave parameters derived from measured frequency spectra hence different requirements were used for selecting data for the two subsets only the data with well separated spectral peaks of swell and young fetch limited waves were included in subset 1 see appendix a for subset 2 only swell free cases were taken into account swell free cases were identified using the hanson and phillips 1999 procedure using comparing the wave spectrum level in the equilibrium range above 2 3 peak frequency with reference toba s spectrum s ω α g u ω 4 where ω 2 π f α 0 06 0 11 u is friction velocity the cases when measured spectrum was below the reference one are classified as contaminated by the swell and thus were not included in subset 2 fig 2 presents 53 independent wave observations in subset 1 augmented by data of babanin and soloviev 1998 table 1 all data included in subset 1 demonstrate consistent fetch behavior and hereinafter are considered as a reference dataset describing fetch limited wave growth data included in subset 2 demonstrate gradual increase of wave energy and decrease of peak frequency observed during at least 1 9 h at stationary winds see fig 3 where mean wave direction is defined as ϕ m 0 7 f p 3 f p φ m f s f d f e the total length of records initially included in subset 2 is about 51 h and contains 292 triplets t e f p 3 3 selection of data corresponding to the duration limited wave growth according to 9 and 12 wave variability at a measurement point is caused by two terms in the left hand side describing wave development in time and space if time development dominates wave growth then the non stationary term the first term in the l h s balances the source function in the right hand side such a truncated form of the energy balance equation is adopted for analysis of subset 2 which contains the cases when duration limited development dominates wave evolution integration of 9 and 12 over time gives 16 e c e g 1 u 10 3 t t φ e d t f c f p g 2 u 10 2 t t φ f d t where e c and f c are the energy and peak frequency predicted by the model angular brackets denote averaging over wave record t is a mean time that provides e c t e f c t f p the right hand sides of 16 are dependent on the measured data only fig 4 demonstrates a comparison of the data with model predictions 16 calculations of source function φ e were based on eqs 10a and 10b while calculations of the φ f were based on eqs 13a and 13b these different formulas gave almost the same results for measured values see fig 4 referring to fig 4 one may see that some records from subset 2 agree well with the model predictions top row while others do not bottom row leading sometimes to negative predicted energy values lower left panel for e the model is restricted by stationary and homogeneous wind conditions that are not always the case due to fast evolving atmospheric processes as a result the wind velocity measured at an observation point might not be consistent with the wave data which keep memory on the wind field outside the platform a comparison of the data with model predictions 16 enables selecting the cases of their consistency after visual inspection records demonstrating the best correspondence to the model were further classified as pure duration limited wave growth cases the standard deviation of these data from 16 does not exceed 12 for both e and f p as found eq 16 had not been fulfilled for about half of the records initially included in subset 2 these records are classified as cases of mixed wave growth when wave development occurs both in space and in time or affected by spatially non uniform wind such records were excluded from subset 2 which was finally reduced to 9 cases with a total duration of about 25 h it should be noted that the suggested procedure to form the subset 2 does not guarantee that data obey the time power laws 1 because the reference time points t 0 have remained unknown in the present study we defined t 0 using the procedure described in appendix b 4 duration limited wave development fig 5 a compares the duration and fetch limited wave growth datasets here the duration limited dataset includes subset 2 and data from hwang and wang 2004 table 3 hereinafter hw data fetch limited data are presented by subset 1 and data from babanin and soloviev 1998 hereinafter bs data both duration and fetch limited types of data are consistent and confirm the universal dependence ε ξ for wave development both in space and in time the correspondence between subset 2 data and hw data is also evident the power law parameters resulting from the duration limited dataset γ 2 89 0 24 a 5 85 1 66 2 31 1 0 6 are close to those of babanin and soloviev 1998 compare with 15a fig 5 b and c show wave development in time for subset 2 and hw data method of determination of initial time of wave development t 0 table a 2 is given in appendix b both datasets are in good agreement thought a bit biased and they scatter around the power laws 1 with constants defined by 15c the bs data and subset 1 of our data converted to time development using 14 are also shown and confirm the general consistency between spatial and temporal wave development fig 5 d illustrates wave development in time using the scaling adopted from the weak turbulence theory for duration limited wave growth the corresponding equation reads zakharov et al 2015 17 h s g t 2 3 06 t p 2 π t 9 4 where t p 1 f p is the wave period of the spectral peak referring to this figure one may find that all the datasets including duration limited data of subset 2 and hw data and converted fetch limited data of subset 1 and bs data are in good agreement with 17 5 conclusions this paper presents a general view on wave growth at duration and fetch limited conditions using simple parametric model the model justifies conversion of the data collected at fetch limited conditions to the data corresponding to duration limited growth see 14 and determines the power law constants of duration limited growth from the fetch limited constants see 11 the model can be considered as a simplified version of the hasselmann et al 1976 parametric model in the present study parameters of the model are specified according to the data of babanin and soloviev 1998 though other empirical data may also be chosen we demonstrated that the model tuned with fetch limited data is also consistent with the field data taken from the research platform at the duration limited conditions analysis of wave development models in a wide range of the wave age gagnaire renou et al 2011 pushkarev and zakharov 2016 is one of the possible applications of the results of this paper in this case conversion equations 11 are useful to convert the specified parameters of the fetch limited power laws into parameters for the duration limited case to wider the tuning options the suggested parametric model enables to investigate development of waves for more complex initial or and boundary conditions a straightforward example is a problem of the moving front between areas of temporal and spatial wave growth discussed in section 2 which can be applied for description of space time evolution of wind waves in a coastal zone see e g wavewatch iii numerical solution to this problem in ardhuin 2019 his figure 4 3 the parametric model can be useful for the physical interpretation of the high spatial resolution satellite data targeted investigation of wave field on meso and global scale kudryavtsev et al 2017a b yurovskaya et al 2018 quilfen et al 2018 ardhuin 2019 to this end the parametric model application has already demonstrated its efficiency to estimate and predict wind waves generated by tropical and polar cyclones kudryavtsev et al 2015 as discussed in section 3 observed development of waves in time at a given point may poorly be linked with the local wind velocity field due to space time variability of wind field in such situations the suggested model could be applied to identify time intervals of pure duration limited development and then to use these refined data for further investigations credit authorship contribution statement vladimir dulov conceptualization model development data

wave energy data from the power law 1a the second square means the same but the energy is obtained by conversion of peak frequency data into energy using 3 thus we took into account both types of data ε i τ i and ξ i τ i with equal weight in the least square problem as found for each of the records with the parameters given by 15 dependence of ψ on τ 0 has a clearly defined minimum see fig b 1 this minimum points to the starting time of wave development the time interval from the start of wave development to the start of a record is included in table a 2 and used in fig 4b d

kitaigorodskii 1962 1970 hasselmann et al 1973 1a ξ ξ 0 τ q 1b ε ε 0 τ p 2a ξ ξ 0 x χ q x 2b ε ε 0 x χ p x where ε e g 2 u 4 ξ f p u g τ t g u χ x g u 2 are the dimensionless wave energy peak frequency time from the beginning of the wave development and fetch from the shore line respectively e is the variance of the sea surface displacement referenced traditionally as the energy which in turn defines the significant wave height as h s 4 e f p is the spectral peak frequency 2 π ξ is the inverse wave age f p is traditionally defined in hz u is the wind speed and g is the gravity acceleration these power laws describe idealized cases the duration limited wave growth in infinite ocean 1a 1b and the fetch limited stationary wave growth 2a 2b for both cases the dimensionless peak frequency and wave energy are linked by 3 ε a ξ γ a ε 0 ξ 0 γ γ p q 4 ε a x ξ γ x a x ε 0 x ξ 0 x γ x γ x p x q x the parametric model of space time evolution of the wave energy suggested by hasselmann et al 1976 follows from the kinetic equation see their equation 3 1 integrated over all directions θ and frequencies f 5 e t v e x s n l s i n s d i s s d ϑ d f where e s f ϑ d ϑ d f s f ϑ is the directional frequency spectrum of waves v is the weighted group velocity defined for deep water by 6 v g cos ϑ s f ϑ d ϑ d f f 4 π s f ϑ d ϑ d f terms in the right hand side of 5 describe non linear wave wave interactions s n l energy input from the wind s i n and energy dissipation s d i s s following hasselmann et al 1973 we assume that during wave evolution either in space or time the wave spectrum obeys the following universal shape 7 s f ϑ α f η ϑ η f f p where f is a universal function α is a function dependent on time or space coordinate and wind speed then using 6 and 7 the weighted group velocity can be written as 8 v g r 4 π f p r cos ϑ f η ϑ d ϑ d η η f η ϑ d ϑ d η assuming a universal spectrum shape 7 zakharov 2005 badulin et al 2005 2007 and zakharov et al 2015 2019 justified that the right hand side of eq 5 is a universal function of f p and e for both fetch limited and duration limited cases generalizing their findings after scaling of eq 5 with u and g we arrive at 9 ε τ r 4 π ξ ε χ φ e ξ ε this equation must describe both the duration limited 1 and the fetch limited 2 wave growth cases hence the right hand side of 9 can be found by substituting the laws 1b or 2b into the left hand side taking into account 3 and 4 the source function in 9 reduces to the single variable function of ε or ξ as a result there are 4 possible representations for the source function φ e ξ ε in 9 10a φ e p ε 0 1 p ε 1 1 p 10b φ e p a ξ 0 1 q ξ 1 p q 10c φ e r 4 π p x ε 0 x 1 p x a x q x p x ε 1 q x 1 p x 10d φ e r 4 π p x a x ξ 0 x 1 q x ξ 1 p x 1 q x these functions match each other only if the following relationships are fulfilled 11 q q x 1 q x p p x 1 q x ξ 0 ξ 0 x 4 π ξ 0 x r 1 q x q ε 0 ε 0 x 4 π ξ 0 x r 1 q x p notice that similar relationships were derived by hwang and wang 2004 see also hwang 2006 hwang et al 2011 using different approaches based on a heuristic argumentation if the set of eqs 11 is fulfilled then the power laws ε ξ for fetch and duration limited growth 3 and 4 become identical substituting ε a ξ γ into 9 we arrived at the equivalent version of eq 9 expressed in terms of wave age kudryavtsev et al 2015 12 ξ τ r 4 π ξ ξ χ φ f ε ξ the source function φ f ε ξ in 12 has also four representations 13a φ f q ξ 0 ε 0 q 1 p ε q 1 p 13b φ f q ξ 0 1 q ξ 1 1 q 13c φ f r 4 π q x ξ 0 x 1 q x a x 1 p x ε 1 p x 13d φ f r 4 π q x ξ 0 x 1 q x ξ 1 q x which similar to 10 match each other if relations 11 are fulfilled thus eqs 9 and 10 or eqs 12 and 13 along with eq 3 constitute a simple parametric model that generalizes classical growth rate laws 1 and 2 for cases of wave development in space or time two important consequences follow from this model relationships between dimensionless energy and wave age ε ξ defined by 3 and 4 for the duration and fetch limited conditions are identical γ γ x a a x eight parameters of the power laws for wave growth in time 1 and in space 2 are not independent but linked by the four relationships 11 hence the parameters of fetch limited power laws can be recalculated into parameters of duration limited power laws and vice versa it is worth noting that badulin et al 2005 2007 and zakharov et al 2015 2019 have found magic relations between exponents in power laws of wave growth in time 2 p 9 q 1 and in space 2 p x 10 q x 1 it is easy to check that relationships 11 provide equivalence of the magic relations in space and in time substituting 11 into one of them we come exactly to another 2 2 application of the model to data analysis since power laws for the fetch and duration limited wave growth cases are interrelated there should be an equation converting the data from one case to another an appropriate relationship between τ and χ can be introduced in two ways equating 1b and 2b and keeping ε unchanged or equating 1a and 2a and keeping ξ unchanged however if 11 is fulfilled both ways lead to the same result 14 τ 4 π ξ 0 x r 1 q x χ 1 q x notice that similar equations were derived earlier by bretschneider 1952 khandekar 1989 and hwang and wang 2004 with the use of heuristic statement t 0 x d x g x where g is close to the spectral peak group velocity this relation is consistent with 14 if g corresponds to the weighted group velocity defined by 8 i e if g v in the case of wave development from a coast starting from the state of rest at t 0 the regions of duration and fetch limited wave growth exist simultaneously separated by a moving front located at χ χ f τ kitaigorodskii 1962 mitsuyasu and rikiishi 1978 massel 2015 within the framework of the simple parametric model this problem has the solution 1 for 0 χ χ f τ and the solution 2 for χ χ f τ relation describing the evolution of the front is χ f r 1 q x 4 π ξ 0 x τ 1 1 q x the dimensionless advance velocity of the front is c f d χ f d τ r 4 π ξ 0 τ q which corresponds to the weighted group velocity 8 this can be easily justified using 11 and 1a for practical use of the model parameters of the power laws must be specified further as the reference parameters we use that proposed by babanin and soloviev 1998 for the fetch limited conditions 15a q x 0 275 0 16 ξ 0 x 2 4 1 0 18 0 19 γ 3 01 0 17 a 8 30 1 90 2 46 1 0 6 hereinafter double standard error is shown as a 95 confidence interval e g bendat and piersol 2010 then using 4 parameters p x and ε 0 x are equal to p x 0 828 ε 0 x 5 88 10 7 as argued by badulin et al 2007 this set of parameters closely corresponds to the wave growth parameters following from the weak turbulence theory it is also worth noting that parameters 15a were derived from the field data collected at the same site as the present data the value of r for a typical jonswap type spectrum is about 0 7 0 8 yefimov and babanin 1991 hwang and wang 2004 zakharov et al 2015 and for the sake of definiteness we further assign r as 15b r 0 76 these constants prescribe according to 11 the following constants of duration limited power laws 15c q 0 379 ξ 0

about 500 m off shore in about 30 m deep water see fig 1 for offshore winds the fetch can easily be determined as the along wind distance from the platform to coastline the wave studies performed from the platform were reported previously e g by babanin and soloviev 1998 leckler et al 2015 and shokurov et al 2016 in this study we used archived wave records to select cases of wave development the surface waves were measured using an array of string wave gauges see fig 1 the wave records were sampled with a frequency of 10 hz the wind speed and direction at height of 21 m air temperature and humidity at height of 19 m and temperature in the upper meter of water were measured permanently with averaging over 1 5 min from the platform using davis meteorological station the wind speed at 10 m height and friction velocity were calculated according to the algorithm of fairall et al 2003 a detailed description of the instrumentation is given by shokurov et al 2016 the wave data were processed in a conventional way earle 1996 using the method of heave slope triplet analysis longuet higgins et al 1963 kuik et al 2002 krogstad 2005 the surface elevations from the 6 wave sensors were least square approximated by a plane to obtain the time series of wave elevation and two wave slopes corresponding to triplet measurements from wave buoys frequency wave spectra were calculated from twenty minute intervals the peak frequency f p of the frequency spectra s f s f ϑ d ϑ was determined with an accuracy of 0 01 hz wave energy was obtained by integrating the spectrum s f over 0 7 3 f p the mean wave direction defined as φ m atan b 1 a 1 was estimated directly from triplet analysis spectral representation s f θ s f π 1 2 a 1 cos θ b 1 sin θ longuet higgins et al 1963 3 2 dataset our measurement data are partitioned into two subsets corresponding to waves coming from the coast subset 1 and the open sea subset 2 only measurements collected at stationary winds were used see appendix a for subset 2 only cases of gradually developing waves were selected as argued by kahma and calkoen 1992 hanson and phillips 1999 ardhuin et al 2007 romero and melville 2010 and others a presence of swell of moderate amplitude does not significantly impact dynamics of wave development however a swell may distort the estimate of wave parameters derived from measured frequency spectra hence different requirements were used for selecting data for the two subsets only the data with well separated spectral peaks of swell and young fetch limited waves were included in subset 1 see appendix a for subset 2 only swell free cases were taken into account swell free cases were identified using the hanson and phillips 1999 procedure using comparing the wave spectrum level in the equilibrium range above 2 3 peak frequency with reference toba s spectrum s ω α g u ω 4 where ω 2 π f α 0 06 0 11 u is friction velocity the cases when measured spectrum was below the reference one are classified as contaminated by the swell and thus were not included in subset 2 fig 2 presents 53 independent wave observations in subset 1 augmented by data of babanin and soloviev 1998 table 1 all data included in subset 1 demonstrate consistent fetch behavior and hereinafter are considered as a reference dataset describing fetch limited wave growth data included in subset 2 demonstrate gradual increase of wave energy and decrease of peak frequency observed during at least 1 9 h at stationary winds see fig 3 where mean wave direction is defined as ϕ m 0 7 f p 3 f p φ m f s f d f e the total length of records initially included in subset 2 is about 51 h and contains 292 triplets t e f p 3 3 selection of data corresponding to the duration limited wave growth according to 9 and 12 wave variability at a measurement point is caused by two terms in the left hand side describing wave development in time and space if time development dominates wave growth then the non stationary term the first term in the l h s balances the source function in the right hand side such a truncated form of the energy balance equation is adopted for analysis of subset 2 which contains the cases when duration limited development dominates wave evolution integration of 9 and 12 over time gives 16 e c e g 1 u 10 3 t t φ e d t f c f p g 2 u 10 2 t t φ f d t where e c and f c are the energy and peak frequency predicted by the model angular brackets denote averaging over wave record t is a mean time that provides e c t e f c t f p the right hand sides of 16 are dependent on the measured data only fig 4 demonstrates a comparison of the data with model predictions 16 calculations of source function φ e were based on eqs 10a and 10b while calculations of the φ f were based on eqs 13a and 13b these different formulas gave almost the same results for measured values see fig 4 referring to fig 4 one may see that some records from subset 2 agree well with the model predictions top row while others do not bottom row leading sometimes to negative predicted energy values lower left panel for e the model is restricted by stationary and homogeneous wind conditions that are not always the case due to fast evolving atmospheric processes as a result the wind velocity measured at an observation point might not be consistent with the wave data which keep memory on the wind field outside the platform a comparison of the data with model predictions 16 enables selecting the cases of their consistency after visual inspection records demonstrating the best correspondence to the model were further classified as pure duration limited wave growth cases the standard deviation of these data from 16 does not exceed 12 for both e and f p as found eq 16 had not been fulfilled for about half of the records initially included in subset 2 these records are classified as cases of mixed wave growth when wave development occurs both in space and in time or affected by spatially non uniform wind such records were excluded from subset 2 which was finally reduced to 9 cases with a total duration of about 25 h it should be noted that the suggested procedure to form the subset 2 does not guarantee that data obey the time power laws 1 because the reference time points t 0 have remained unknown in the present study we defined t 0 using the procedure described in appendix b 4 duration limited wave development fig 5 a compares the duration and fetch limited wave growth datasets here the duration limited dataset includes subset 2 and data from hwang and wang 2004 table 3 hereinafter hw data fetch limited data are presented by subset 1 and data from babanin and soloviev 1998 hereinafter bs data both duration and fetch limited types of data are consistent and confirm the universal dependence ε ξ for wave development both in space and in time the correspondence between subset 2 data and hw data is also evident the power law parameters resulting from the duration limited dataset γ 2 89 0 24 a 5 85 1 66 2 31 1 0 6 are close to those of babanin and soloviev 1998 compare with 15a fig 5 b and c show wave development in time for subset 2 and hw data method of determination of initial time of wave development t 0 table a 2 is given in appendix b both datasets are in good agreement thought a bit biased and they scatter around the power laws 1 with constants defined by 15c the bs data and subset 1 of our data converted to time development using 14 are also shown and confirm the general consistency between spatial and temporal wave development fig 5 d illustrates wave development in time using the scaling adopted from the weak turbulence theory for duration limited wave growth the corresponding equation reads zakharov et al 2015 17 h s g t 2 3 06 t p 2 π t 9 4 where t p 1 f p is the wave period of the spectral peak referring to this figure one may find that all the datasets including duration limited data of subset 2 and hw data and converted fetch limited data of subset 1 and bs data are in good agreement with 17 5 conclusions this paper presents a general view on wave growth at duration and fetch limited conditions using simple parametric model the model justifies conversion of the data collected at fetch limited conditions to the data corresponding to duration limited growth see 14 and determines the power law constants of duration limited growth from the fetch limited constants see 11 the model can be considered as a simplified version of the hasselmann et al 1976 parametric model in the present study parameters of the model are specified according to the data of babanin and soloviev 1998 though other empirical data may also be chosen we demonstrated that the model tuned with fetch limited data is also consistent with the field data taken from the research platform at the duration limited conditions analysis of wave development models in a wide range of the wave age gagnaire renou et al 2011 pushkarev and zakharov 2016 is one of the possible applications of the results of this paper in this case conversion equations 11 are useful to convert the specified parameters of the fetch limited power laws into parameters for the duration limited case to wider the tuning options the suggested parametric model enables to investigate development of waves for more complex initial or and boundary conditions a straightforward example is a problem of the moving front between areas of temporal and spatial wave growth discussed in section 2 which can be applied for description of space time evolution of wind waves in a coastal zone see e g wavewatch iii numerical solution to this problem in ardhuin 2019 his figure 4 3 the parametric model can be useful for the physical interpretation of the high spatial resolution satellite data targeted investigation of wave field on meso and global scale kudryavtsev et al 2017a b yurovskaya et al 2018 quilfen et al 2018 ardhuin 2019 to this end the parametric model application has already demonstrated its efficiency to estimate and predict wind waves generated by tropical and polar cyclones kudryavtsev et al 2015 as discussed in section 3 observed development of waves in time at a given point may poorly be linked with the local wind velocity field due to space time variability of wind field in such situations the suggested model could be applied to identify time intervals of pure duration limited development and then to use these refined data for further investigations credit authorship contribution statement vladimir dulov conceptualization model development data

russian science foundation grant no 17 77 30019 appendix a data summary dataset on fetch limited conditions was formed from 23 offshore wind cases each of them was several hours long we selected one hour non overlapping intervals where i wind direction standard deviation did not exceed 10 ii relative standard deviation of wind speed did not exceed 20 and iii young developing waves were well distinguished and well separated from the swell in the frequency s f and angular φ m f spectra see fig a 1 mean values of the spectral peak frequencies the significant wave heights and wind velocities within these intervals which were used for analyses are listed in table a 1 the f p and h s for young waves were calculated after partitioning the spectrum see fig a 1 and omitting the swell part for these data mean wind direction was in the range 334 360 swell peak frequency was in the range 0 1 0 4 hz swell significant wave height was in the range 0 12 1 31 m and angle between wind and swell directions was in the range 56 180 we represent the atmospheric boundary layer stratification by the bulk richardson number r b g t a t w z t t a 273 u 21 z u 2 where t a and t w are the air and water

background atmospheric parameters for subset 2 and evaluated reference time points according to this data atmosphere stratification during our experiments was almost neutral for peak frequencies listed in tables a 1 and a 2 the wave group velocity at the platform depth exceeds its value for deep water less than 2 thus the model developed in section 2 for deep water applies to analyses of these data appendix b determination of time starting points we defined the reference time in 1 for each of wave records by minimizing over τ 0 the following sum of squares ψ i ln ε i ln ε 0 p ln τ 0 τ i 2 ln a ξ i γ ln ε 0 p ln τ 0 τ i 2 where the summation is performed over the entire record and the parameters of the power laws ε 0 p a γ are fixed the first square of the sum means deviation of wave energy data from the power law 1a the second square means the same but the energy is obtained by conversion of peak frequency data into energy using 3 thus we took into account both types of data ε i τ i and ξ i τ i with equal weight in the least square problem as found for each of the records with the parameters given by 15 dependence of ψ on τ 0 has a clearly defined minimum see fig b 1 this minimum points to the starting time of wave development the time interval from the start of wave development to the start of a record is included in table a 2 and used in fig 4b d
