9990,a correct estimation of crop coefficients kc is essential to assess water requirements of crops from weather variables and thereby optimize irrigation management kc depends on crop type and varies with crop growth stage and to a limited extent with climate kc values are often assumed to be transferable between locations and climates kc values have not been determined yet for modern potato cultivars grown under south african semi arid climatic conditions the objectives of this study were i to quantify evapotranspiration and water use efficiency wue of potato crops in a semi arid climate under irrigation ii to estimate kc values for these crops at different growth stages and iii to assess the usefulness of the penman monteith equation to estimate evapotranspiration and irrigation requirements an eddy covariance ecv system was used in potato fields planted with the variety mondial in two production regions of south africa limpopo crop growing in winter and north west spring summer crop additional sensors were added to the system to measure relative humidity near surface soil temperature solar radiation rainfall and irrigation decagon 10 hs capacitance sensors installed at varying soil depths were used to measure the change in soil moisture content of the potato rooted zone accuracy of the ecv measurements was evaluated by following the energy balance closure method seasonal mean crop evapotranspiration etc was 3 2 mm d 1 for the crop in limpopo and 5 7 mm d 1 in north west the reference evapotranspiration eto correlated well with the daily patterns in etc for most of the season eto thus serves as a useful indicator of etc and can be used for irrigation scheduling of potato seasonal mean kc value was 0 99 for the crop in limpopo and 0 78 in north west while the kc value in limpopo likely represented that for a crop free of water stress the crop growth in north west was likely somewhat limited by water availability the winter crop had the highest wue of 3 55 kg dry potato tuber m 3 of water evapotranspired whilst wue for the spring summer crop was 3 03 kg m 3 this difference could be explained by differences in mean vapour pressure deficit between the growing seasons to optimize wue of potato growing in semi arid water scarce regions such as south africa it is advisable to grow crops in the coolest available growing season outside the frost prone period keywords water use efficiency penman monteith energy closure irrigation soil water balance 1 introduction potato is considered a cool weather crop yielding well in temperate environments with long day lengths potato production in southern africa and other regions in the world however takes place in warmer environments with shorter day lengths in south africa the average area under potato production in 2015 2017 was 52 000 ha with an average marketable yield of 44 t ha 1 potatoes south africa 2019 south africa has sixteen potato production regions with distinct agro ecological conditions this geographical dispersion enables south africa to produce potatoes year round though the quality and quantity varies with the time of year the main potato production areas are in limpopo the western and the eastern free state and the western cape the sandveld south africa is a semi arid country with an annual rainfall averaging 450 mm and evaporation exceeding rainfall in most regions harding 2015 over 90 of the potato production area in south africa partly or fully relies on irrigation for water supply to the crop and the availability of irrigation water limits production particularly in those areas reliant on borehole water the energy cost of irrigation contributes up to 25 of total energy use in potato production and this is largely determined by the amount of water applied and depth of the water table steyn et al 2016 a strong relationship was identified between energy costs for irrigation and total carbon footprint of potato production in south africa steyn et al 2016 furthermore irrigation impacts the use efficiency of nutrients djaman et al 2021 as potato has a shallow root system and is often grown on well drained sandy soils the risk of water and nutrient losses through drainage is high crop water use is influenced by many factors that are variable and interdependent on one another such as the climate the type and growth stage of the crop the root system soil characteristics crop phenology and type of irrigation system testa et al 2011 djaman et al 2021 farmers tend to over irrigate to avoid any risk of drought stress in case they are unsure when and how much to irrigate the limited use of decision support tools and systems for irrigation scheduling and management by farmers worsens the problem the sustainability of potato production in south africa thus strongly depends on the efficient management of irrigation water to enhance crop productivity while minimizing salinification drainage and nutrient leaching steyn et al 2016 determining evapotranspiration of a crop etc is crucial in estimating the crop s irrigation requirements from weather variables kashyap and panda 2001 parent and anctil 2012 anapalli et al 2018 various decision support systems are available to farmers to schedule irrigation estimates of etc through the penman monteith equation pereira et al 2015 2021 marin et al 2019 are often used in these systems in this approach the grass reference evapotranspiration eto is calculated using local weather data as input etc is calculated by multiplying eto with a crop specific factor kc a single kc value may be used for the whole season or it may vary for different growing stages the crop coefficient may represent both crop transpiration and soil evaporation as a single value whilst the dual crop factor approach considers these terms separately testa et al 2011 shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 the penman monteith method is not always accurate across localities which can lead to inaccurate estimates of crop water requirements facchi et al 2013 although kc values are primarily crop dependent they are also affected by the environmental and management conditions under which they were obtained kc values for a single crop may vary considerably between locations due to differences in variety soil properties irrigation methods climate and crop management practices payero and irmak 2011 jiang et al 2014 xu et al 2018 consequently it is preferable to derive kc values for local conditions to accurately determine crop water requirements singh rawat et al 2019 anapalli et al 2020 quantifying kc values of a crop requires an accurate estimation of the crop evapotranspiration recently eddy covariance ecv systems have become more accurate and affordable for use in cropping systems allowing direct and continuous measurements of vertical gas fluxes over a crop surface parent and anctil 2012 anapalli et al 2018 mbangiwa et al 2019 water vapour and carbon dioxide co2 are the most commonly measured gasses the ecv method makes it possible to accurately estimate et over a short time period and a large area energy balance is typically used to check the degree of error when estimating et using micro meteorological equipment the energy balance closure which is a formulation of the first law of thermodynamics requires that the sum of the estimated latent energy le and the measured sensible heat flux h be equivalent to the measured net radiation rn and soil heat flux g wilson et al 2002 however imbalances have been observed and a number of explanations such as inhomogeneous terrain and sensor alignment problems have been proposed in such situations parent and anctil 2012 parent and anctil 2012 used ecv techniques to quantify et of a rain fed potato crop during a season at a single site in south eastern canada we are not aware of any other published studies quantifying et in potato with ecv techniques therefore we conducted a field study with the following objectives i to quantify evapotranspiration and water use efficiency of potato crops grown in different locations and seasons in a semi arid climate under irrigation ii to estimate kc values in both sites at different growth stages iii to assess the usefulness of the penman monteith equation to estimate evapotranspiration and irrigation water requirements 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and crop management potato fields for monitoring were selected on commercial farms in two production regions of south africa one site was in limpopo nearby the village of tom burke 23 06 34 64 s 28 04 25 29 e 854 masl tom burke has more of a tropical climate with hot summers and mild winters rainfall mostly occurs during summer the second site was in north west province nearby the village of louwna 28 41 13 08 s 24 12 38 10 e 1357 masl in the vryburg district the climate is characterized by warm to hot summers and dry and cold winters rainfall occurs primarily in summer both sites receive a mean annual rainfall of 350 400 mm the fields in both regions were under center pivot irrigation systems for which detailed information is presented in table 1 in limpopo potato was grown as a winter crop as the area is largely frost free and summers are too hot for potato production in north west the crop was planted in spring growing into summer the soils of both sites were well draining and had a high sand content 90 sand a low water holding ability mean field capacity of 0 224 m3 m 3 and wilting point of 0 099 m3 m 3 and were vulnerable to nutrient leaching variety mondial the most widely grown potato variety in south africa was planted at both sites seed tubers were planted in rows spaced 0 9 m apart at a target plant density of 40 000 44 000 plants per ha crop emergence was above 50 at 23 days after planting dap in north west and at 25 dap in limpopo table 2 granular water soluble and foliar based fertilizers were applied to the crop during the growing season through a combination of broadcasting before and after planting band placement with planting fertigation and spraying high amounts of nutrients n p k and ca were applied to the crops table 2 and nutrient availability was unlikely to limit crop growth the haulms of the potato crops in north west were killed before the crop fully senesced for marketing reasons in limpopo the crop was allowed to senesce naturally 2 2 data collection an irgason integrated open path co2 h2o gas analyzer ecv system campbell scientific was used to measure the h2o vapour fluxes above the crop canopy it was integrated with a sonic anemometer which measures the three dimensional wind speed the following sensors were added to the system fine wire thermocouple nr lite net radiometer silicon pyranometer krypton hygrometer cs616 reflectometer and hukseflux heat flux plates the ecv system was installed in the fields close to the center with minimal damage to the surrounding potato plants data were sampled at a frequency of 10 hz processed using easyflux dl software campbell scientific and recorded using a cr3000 datalogger the datalogger and ecv system were powered by a 14 v solar charged battery the gas analyzer was installed on a tripod mast at a height of 2 0 m above the soil surface and oriented towards the predominant wind direction this was west in north west and northeast in limpopo the fields 10 20 ha in size were large enough to meet the average fetch requirement of 150 m ecv measurements commenced 29 dap in north west and 26 dap in limpopo which approximately coincided with crop emergence weather data were obtained from automatic weather stations campbell scientific installed at the trial sites fresh tuber yield and tuber dry matter content were measured through destructive sampling at crop maturity the tuber dry matter content was determined from sub samples that were oven dried at 70 c until constant weight the amount of water supplied to the crop was measured using tipping bucket rain gauges texas electronics with data loggers campbell scientific cr200x installed at eight random positions across the field in limpopo and an ultrasonic flow meter flowmetrix mounted onto the pivot water supply line at north west furthermore soil moisture monitoring stations were installed close to the ecv systems at both sites each monitoring station consisted of five capacitance sensors decagon 10hs installed at 10 20 30 40 and 50 cm depth and connected to a datalogger campbell scientific cr200x to facilitate continuous data collection the sensors were calibrated in situ by taking periodic soil samples at corresponding depths and comparing the measured water contents to sensor readings these measurements were used to estimate daily changes in soil water content soil moisture depletion per layer was calculated as the difference between field capacity and measured moisture content of that layer these were then accumulated to obtain the daily soil moisture depletion of the root zone 0 50 cm moreover a drain gauge lysimeter decagon g3 was installed in the field in north west to measure deep drainage beyond 1 0 m depth application efficiency ae of the two centre pivot irrigation systems was measured by comparing the amount of water collected in rain gauges positioned at the soil surface with the volume entering the system according to the procedures by koegelenberg and breedt 2003 the ae determines the fraction of water applied by the sprinklers that reaches the soil surface and gives an indication of wind drift and evaporation losses koegelenberg and breedt 2003 the measured ae of the two systems was 83 in limpopo and 81 in north west table 1 2 3 data handling and analyses quality assurance and control are recommended for ecv measurements foken et al 2012 the measurement system accomplished quality assurance by using diagnostic outputs from the sonic anemometer and infrared gas analyzer the datalogger used raw data for flux calculations only when sensors functioned normally and measurements were within reasonable and calibrated ranges and when signal strengths were adequate the easyflux datalogger program easyflux dl corrected for high and low frequency losses caused by the blocking average for the 30 min intervals systematic corrections were also done for the vertical air velocity due to heat and water vapour transfer in the atmospheric surface layer easyflux dl followed the method presented by foken et al 2012 to grade the relative quality of co2 le h and momentum fluxes the relative non stationarity rn cov relative integral turbulence characteristic itc sw and the wind direction in the sonic instrument coordinate system wnd dir sonic were calculated and used to grade the quality of the data rn cov described the steady state itc sw defined the development of turbulence conditions and wnd dir sonic described the wind direction each covariance variable over the averaging period was assigned an overall quality grade from 1 to 9 based on the individual grades of rn cov itc sw and wnd dir sonic grade 1 was the highest overall quality whilst grade 9 was the poorest the energy balance closure e closure was used to evaluate the accuracy of the ecv measurements the sum of the estimated latent energy le and sensible heat flux h must be equivalent to all other energy sinks and sources net radiation rn and soil heat flux g 1 e closure le h r n g the bowen ratio closure method chávez et al 2009 was used to compensate for discrepancies between rn g and le h around noon between 10 00 and 15 00 when the bowen ratio is assumed constant the calculations followed the procedures detailed by ding et al 2010 the adjusted le was used to estimate daytime crop evapotranspiration etc measured by the ecv daily kc values were calculated following the single crop coefficient method as the ratio of etc measured by the ecv to the reference evapotranspiration eto

rooted zone δs 8 r i et c d s seasonal values of water inputs and outputs were calculated by summing up daily values water balances were assessed from emergence when the ecv system was installed until crop senescence or killing three types of water use efficiencies wue were calculated wue et the yield per unit of total water lost through crop evapotranspiration from emergence as measured by the ecv

regression analyses were used to assess the energy balance closure of the ecv measurements 3 results 3 1 weather conditions and irrigation management in limpopo temperatures during the growing season were relatively cool compared to north west fig 1a as the crop was planted early winter and harvested in spring table 2 temperatures gradually increased during the cropping season only 15 mm of rainfall was received during the season from planting and the crop strongly depended on supplementary irrigation for its water supply table 2 irrigation 4 9 mm per event was applied usually every second day the crop was irrigated less frequently every third day between dae 1 and 14 and daily between dae 90 and 100 when temperatures were relatively high in north west the growing season was also unusually dry with only 19 mm of rainfall received the crop was irrigated almost every day from emergence to crop termination typically receiving 5 8 mm per event the crop was planted in spring and harvested in mid summer with warm maximum day temperatures frequently 35 c from crop emergence until maturity fig 1b solar radiation was higher in nw than in limpopo reflecting the different growing seasons sudden dips in radiation fig 1 were due to cloudy conditions no weather data were obtained at 43 and 82 dae in limpopo vapour pressure deficit vpd during the growing season was generally lower in limpopo than in north west fig 2 due to lower temperatures in limpopo the relative humidity was low during the growing seasons at both sites the seasonal mean vpd was 1 88 kpa in limpopo and 2 35 kpa in north west standard deviation of 0 72 and 0 59 respectively 3 2 energy balances and diurnal courses at the site in limpopo the amount of energy measured by the ecv closely matched the available energy sources and sinks in both the 30 min interval data and the daytime data the regression line closely matched the 1 1 line and only few strong outliers could be observed fig 3 a b c with high correlation coefficients r between rn g and le h of 0 97 for the 30 min and 0 94 for the daytime data the energy discrepancies were larger in north west fig 3 c d e where rn g tended to be larger than le h at higher values more outliers could be observed in the data from north west as reflected by correlation coefficients r of 0 94 for the 30 min and 0 83 for the daytime data the daytime discrepancies were used to correct the daytime le and etc estimations as explained in the methodology daytime rn g was generally higher than le h as the radiant energy received during the daytime resulted in positive rn as energy was supplied to the vegetation surface for evapotranspiration h g and le were also positive during the day as the energy supplied by rn was lost from the surface through heat conduction into the soil heat transfer into the atmosphere and evapotranspiration fig 4 after correction the correlation between rn g and le h was high r 0 96 for the 24 h data from north west fig 3e and the energy imbalance improved from 17 to 4 modest adjustments to etc were made due to corrections of the daytime energy balance and did not have major impact on calculated kc values the mean daily rn in north west 600 700 w m 2 was higher than in limpopo 400 500 w m 2 parent and anctil 2012 also obtained lower values of rn in a cooler season with low radiation and ambient temperature conditions mean temperature 15 2 c total rainfall 563 3 mm at night rn was negative as there was no solar radiation and therefore no energy supplied le indicative of evapotranspiration was minimal at night as the stomata are closed le started to increase after sunrise and largely followed the inclination of the sun reaching a peak just after midday le started to decline before maximum temperatures were reached at 14 00 15 00 indicating that it is more driven by solar radiation than by air temperature the mean le peaked at 367 w m 2 in north west and at 272 w m 2 in limpopo the daytime energy exchange at the crop surface was greater in north west than in limpopo where lower radiation and shorter day lengths occurred in winter the mean diurnal courses of the energy balance components were consistent with what is expected from a crop surface 3 3 water vapour fluxes and crop coefficients the mean daily etc over the growing season was 3 2 mm in limpopo and 5 7 mm in north west these differences in daily etc reflected differences in latent heat flux as governed by weather conditions and day length in limpopo daily eto and etc gradually increased over the growing season fig 5a as temperatures and radiation levels increased with the crop growing into spring fig 1a the correlation between eto and etc was high during the entire season with the exception of the vegetative phase the first 2 weeks after emergence table 3 the high etc and low discrepancy with eto could have been a result of an increase in etc due to low vpd in winter in north west eto and etc were higher fig 5b than in limpopo moreover the discrepancies between eto and etc were larger the discrepancies were relatively large in the beginning of the growing season vegetative growth stage the correlation improved in the growth stages thereafter and etc followed eto more closely table 3 towards the end of the growing cycle etc tended to be lower than eto at both sites the total etc etct over the growing season from emergence based on ecv measurements was 338 mm in limpopo and 466 mm in north west table 4 etct was relatively low in limpopo due to cooler weather conditions during winter at both sites daily kc values were rather variable in the first 2 3 weeks after emergence fig 6 reflecting the discrepancies between eto and etc fig 5 in limpopo kc values were higher in the initial stage even though the crop canopy did not fully cover the soil this could be a result of soil evaporation being the major contributor to etc as observed with the high soil moisture depletion from emergence even though soil was initially at field capacity pereira et al 2021 thereafter when the crop canopy fully covered the soil kc values were fairly stable at both sites fig 6 table 3 kc values slightly declined towards the end of the growing cycle presumably because the crop senesced and photosynthesized and transpired less actively the average kc values for the entire growing season from crop emergence were 0 99 in limpopo and 0 78 in north west table 3 where kc values were consistently lower than in limpopo fig 6 the observed maximum kc values were lower than the general upper limit for crops suggested by allen et al 2011a 2011b of 1 4 for a grass reference base of etc in arid climates 3 4 water balances and use efficiencies at both sites the water holding capacity of the sandy soils was relatively low while the maximum rooting depth of the crop was estimated at 60 cm the soil was approximately at field capacity at emergence at both sites in limpopo the soil moisture depletion in the rooted zone increased gradually from emergence reaching a maximum of 32 mm at 55 dae and declined thereafter fig 7 at full senescence the soil water content was almost similar to that at emergence although drainage was not assessed at the site in limpopo drainage was likely small and if it occurred it was probably around or before emergence or during the final days of senescence in north west the soil water deficit in the rooted zone increased over the growing season reaching 65 mm at crop maturity fig 7 no drainage was observed in the drainage lysimeter during the growing season table 4 which was in line with the soil moisture data showing increasing deficits only after harvest rainfall led to some measured drainage data not shown even though irrigation in north west was more frequent and almost applied daily the higher daily maximum temperatures led to higher etc and soil moisture depletion fig 7 the inputs and outputs of water in the soil from emergence to crop senescence was rather balanced at both sites with estimated total inputs being close to the total outputs table 4 the site in limpopo yielded 64 t fresh tuber ha 1 table 5 the tuber dry matter content in limpopo was 18 8 resulting in 12 0 t dry tuber ha 1 table 5 the site in north west provided 76 t fresh tuber ha 1 with a dry matter percentage of 18 5 resulting in 14 1 t dry tuber ha 1 although the growing period in north west was relatively short high radiation levels resulted in a high yield despite a lower yield the crop in limpopo had a higher wueet and wuer i than the crop in north west table 5 however after normalizing wue for vpd the wue achieved in north west was higher than in limpopo table 5 this is discussed in more detail below 4 discussion because of the large fetch of the ecv system and the high frequency of sampling the direct etc measurements by an ecv system can be more representative for a field than etc estimates based on soil water balance approaches however the commonly observed discrepancies in the energy balance can raise questions about the reliability of ecv measurements widmoser and wohlfahrt 2018 at both sites in this study the infra red gas analyzer was calibrated just before installation in the field and observed discrepancies in the energy balance were unlikely due to inaccurate measurements by the analyzer the wider discrepancies in the data from north west may be partly due to more turbulent weather conditions typically occurring in spring and summer highly turbulent conditions can reduce measurement accuracy parent and anctil 2012 anapalli et al 2018 the ecv measurements of le and h represented a larger area of the field whereas rn and g were local measurements and this could have contributed to the lack of closure of the energy balance imbalances could also have been caused by an under estimation of g in north west due to the relatively dry soil conditions from 40 dae until crop senescence under such conditions g could be up to 50 of rn whilst le and h will be low heusinkveld et al 2004 in case g is under estimated the available energy for turbulent fluxes will be over estimated seasonal soil water inputs and outputs were well balanced at both sites suggesting that the etc measurements by the ecv systems were fairly accurate etct over the growing seasons compared well with et values determined using soil water balance methods under comparable conditions steyn et al 2007 reported an etct of potato in a comparable semi arid climate in pretoria south africa of 579 mm for a summer crop and 360 mm for an autumn crop ferreira and carr 2002 reported etct values of 325 mm and 569 mm for short and long season crops harvested 88 and 117 dae in a hot and dry climate in this study the observed day to day variations in eto and etc were clearly related to each other however the strength of the relationship between eto and etc and thus the stability of the kc value depended on crop growth stage the relationship between eto and etc was stronger and kc values were more stable when the crop had a full canopy and the crop grew at maximum capacity in the middle of the growing season fig 5 table 3 a poorer correlation between etc and eto at both sites just after emergence was likely related to the low soil cover during this growth stage eto is indicative for etc when a crop has reached full soil cover if part of the soil is bare evapotranspiration is more driven by evaporation which is difficult to predict based on weather variables as it depends on factors such as the humidity and albedo of the soil surface at low soil cover spikes in soil evaporation may occur directly after each wetting irrigation rain event pereira et al 2021 these spikes contribute to the day to day variation in etc towards the end of the growing season when the crop senesced and leaves physiologically aged discrepancies between eto and etc became somewhat larger and kc values slightly declined this was likely the result of crop senescence and the associated reduction in photosynthesis and transpiration rates in limpopo a stronger correlation between eto and etc and higher kc values were observed compared to the results from north west table 3 in limpopo soil moisture measurements throughout the season suggested that crop growth was unlikely limited by water availability in north west however soil moisture deficits in the rooted zone increased throughout the season and crop growth was probably limited by water availability this difference in drought stress between the two sites was in line with visual assessments of the crops the occasional drought stress in north west explains the observed weaker correlation between eto and etc moreover drought stress may explain the lower kc values in north west furthermore high temperatures as experienced in spring and summer in north west lead to decreased leaf and stomatal conductance and increased vpd fig 2 limiting plant transpiration under conditions of high atmospheric demand marin et al 2016 xu et al 2018 when the atmospheric evaporative demand is high as indicated by a high vapour pressure deficit plants may partially close their stomata to reduce transpiration fernandes silva et al 2016 anapalli et al 2018 marin et al 2019 so besides the impact of water stress the lower kc values in north west may have been due to this stomatal response to the high air temperatures tmax 30 c crop management at both sites was such that the crops were unlikely to suffer significant nutrient pest or disease related stresses any stresses that affect the crop most likely also affect kc values the measured kc values at both sites fell within the variability reported by other studies though the values observed in limpopo were relatively high table 6 allen et al 1998 noted that weather based evapotranspiration equations are not expected to perfectly predict etc under different climatic conditions due to simplification in formulation and errors in measurements of air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed mean kc values should remain relatively stable during a specific growth stage in case the crop is well watered as was observed during the tuber initiation and bulking stages covering most of the growing season the results indicated that eto derived from weather variables can be used to estimate etc of potato and water requirements for irrigation management bandyopadhyay et al 2003 anapalli et al 2018 however estimations of the actual irrigation water requirement should take into account the soil type and effective precipitation and can be substantially more than evapotranspiration due to other losses such as irrigation inefficiencies drainage and run off testa et al 2011 seidel et al 2019 in the absence of rainfall farmers using appropriate irrigation scheduling tools can accurately match irrigation amounts with crop demand reducing water losses to a minimum even on well draining sandy soils as observed in this study heavy rainfall events mostly occurring in summer in the study region can lead to substantial drainage which may cause an imbalance between water input and evapotranspiration this type of drainage cannot be avoided through improved irrigation management the high tuber yields achieved in north west table 5 indicated that the crop was only mildly affected by drought stress in general a drought stressed crop is expected to use water more efficiently than a crop free of water stress however the observed wueet and the wuer i of the crop in limpopo were higher than in north west cooler ambient temperatures in winter in limpopo resulted in a lower vpd fig 2 and likely a lower transpiration by the crop for a certain amount of co2 absorbed steyn et al 2007 also reported higher transpirational wue in the cooler season autumn than a warmer season spring when wue was normalized for vpd the wue in north west was somewhat higher than in limpopo this difference is likely related to the conditions of drought stress experienced by the crop in north west reducing crop transpiration 5 conclusions this study is the first application of ecv techniques in potato crops planted in different seasons in a semi arid climate etc had a distinct seasonal pattern with a gradual increase from emergence reaching a peak at full canopy cover tuber bulking stages and declining later in season as the crop matured and senesced tuber maturity stage seasonal kc values for the spring and winter crops were 0 78 and 0 99 respectively while eto served as a good indicator of the day to day patterns in etc measured by the ecv system the seasonal kc values varied considerably between winter and spring summer crops this suggests that eto which can be relatively easily estimated based on data from a weather station can be used for irrigation scheduling of potato but kc values used to estimate crop evapotranspiration may need to be adjusted depending on the cropping season wueet and wuer i of potato were higher for the crop growing in the cooler winter compared to the crop growing in spring summer despite higher yields and a modest irrigation regime in the spring summer crop to optimize wue of potato in water scarce areas that rely mostly on irrigation water for potato production it is advisable to grow potato crops in the coolest growing season for south africa that is winter in frost free areas and the first planting window in spring in frost prone areas further studies should focus on collecting etc and eto data in different climates and seasons so as to improve our understanding if and how kc of potato is affected by weather and crop management conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare

closure method seasonal mean crop evapotranspiration etc was 3 2 mm d 1 for the crop in limpopo and 5 7 mm d 1 in north west the reference evapotranspiration eto correlated well with the daily patterns in etc for most of the season eto thus serves as a useful indicator of etc and can be used for irrigation scheduling of potato seasonal mean kc value was 0 99 for the crop in limpopo and 0 78 in north west while the kc value in limpopo likely represented that for a crop free of water stress the crop growth in north west was likely somewhat limited by water availability the winter crop had the highest wue of 3 55 kg dry potato tuber m 3 of water evapotranspired whilst wue for the spring summer crop was 3 03 kg m 3 this difference could be explained by differences in mean vapour pressure deficit between the growing seasons to optimize wue of potato growing in semi arid water scarce regions such as south africa it is advisable to grow crops in the coolest available growing season outside the frost prone period keywords water use efficiency penman monteith energy closure irrigation soil water balance 1 introduction potato is considered a cool weather crop yielding well in temperate environments with long day lengths potato production in southern africa and other regions in the world however takes place in warmer environments with shorter day lengths in south africa the average area under potato production in 2015 2017 was 52 000 ha with an average marketable yield of 44 t ha 1 potatoes south africa 2019 south africa has sixteen potato production regions with distinct agro ecological conditions this geographical dispersion enables south africa to produce potatoes year round though the quality and quantity varies with the time of year the main potato production areas are in limpopo the western and the eastern free state and the western cape the sandveld south africa is a semi arid country with an annual rainfall averaging 450 mm and evaporation exceeding rainfall in most regions harding 2015 over 90 of the potato production area in south africa partly or fully relies on irrigation for water supply to the crop and the availability of irrigation water limits production particularly in those areas reliant on borehole water the energy cost of irrigation contributes up to 25 of total energy use in potato production and this is largely determined by the amount of water applied and depth of the water table steyn et al 2016 a strong relationship was identified between energy costs for irrigation and total carbon footprint of potato production in south africa steyn et al 2016 furthermore irrigation impacts the use efficiency of nutrients djaman et al 2021 as potato has a shallow root system and is often grown on well drained sandy soils the risk of water and nutrient losses through drainage is high crop water use is influenced by many factors that are variable and interdependent on one another such as the climate the type and growth stage of the crop the root system soil characteristics crop phenology and type of irrigation system testa et al 2011 djaman et al 2021 farmers tend to over irrigate to avoid any risk of drought stress in case they are unsure when and how much to irrigate the limited use of decision support tools and systems for irrigation scheduling and management by farmers worsens the problem the sustainability of potato production in south africa thus strongly depends on the efficient management of irrigation water to enhance crop productivity while minimizing salinification drainage and nutrient leaching steyn et al 2016 determining evapotranspiration of a crop etc is crucial in estimating the crop s irrigation requirements from weather variables kashyap and panda 2001 parent and anctil 2012 anapalli et al 2018 various decision support systems are available to farmers to schedule irrigation estimates of etc through the penman monteith equation pereira et al 2015 2021 marin et al 2019 are often used in these systems in this approach the grass reference evapotranspiration eto is calculated using local weather data as input etc is calculated by multiplying eto with a crop specific factor kc a single kc value may be used for the whole season or it may vary for different growing stages the crop coefficient may represent both crop transpiration and soil evaporation as a single value whilst the dual crop factor approach considers these terms separately testa et al 2011 shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 the penman monteith method is not always accurate across localities which can lead to inaccurate estimates of crop water requirements facchi et al 2013 although kc values are primarily crop dependent they are also affected by the environmental and management conditions under which they were obtained kc values for a single crop may vary considerably between locations due to differences in variety soil properties irrigation methods climate and crop management practices payero and irmak 2011 jiang et al 2014 xu et al 2018 consequently it is preferable to derive kc values for local conditions to accurately determine crop water requirements singh rawat et al 2019 anapalli et al 2020 quantifying kc values of a crop requires an accurate estimation of the crop evapotranspiration recently eddy covariance ecv systems have become more accurate and affordable for use in cropping systems allowing direct and continuous measurements of vertical gas fluxes over a crop surface parent and anctil 2012 anapalli et al 2018 mbangiwa et al 2019 water vapour and carbon dioxide co2 are the most commonly measured gasses the ecv method makes it possible to accurately estimate et over a short time period and a large area energy balance is typically used to check the degree of error when estimating et using micro meteorological equipment the energy balance closure which is a formulation of the first law of thermodynamics requires that the sum of the estimated latent energy le and the measured sensible heat flux h be equivalent to the measured net radiation rn and soil heat flux g wilson et al 2002 however imbalances have been observed and a number of explanations such as inhomogeneous terrain and sensor alignment problems have been proposed in such situations parent and anctil 2012 parent and anctil 2012 used ecv techniques to quantify et of a rain fed potato crop during a season at a single site in south eastern canada we are not aware of any other published studies quantifying et in potato with ecv techniques therefore we conducted a field study with the following objectives i to quantify evapotranspiration and water use efficiency of potato crops grown in different locations and seasons in a semi arid climate under irrigation ii to estimate kc values in both sites at different growth stages iii to assess the usefulness of the penman monteith equation to estimate evapotranspiration and irrigation water requirements 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and crop management potato fields for monitoring were selected on commercial farms in two production regions of south africa one site was in limpopo nearby the village of tom burke 23 06 34 64 s 28 04 25 29 e 854 masl tom burke has more of a tropical climate with hot summers and mild winters rainfall mostly occurs during summer the second site was in north west province nearby the village of louwna 28 41 13 08 s 24 12 38 10 e 1357 masl in the vryburg district the climate is characterized by warm to hot summers and dry and cold winters rainfall occurs primarily in summer both sites receive a mean annual rainfall of 350 400 mm the fields in both regions were under center pivot irrigation systems for which detailed information is presented in table 1 in limpopo potato was grown as a winter crop as the area is largely frost free and summers are too hot for potato production in north west the crop was planted in spring growing into summer the soils of both sites were well draining and had a high sand content 90 sand a low water holding ability mean field capacity of 0 224 m3 m 3 and wilting point of 0 099 m3 m 3 and were vulnerable to nutrient leaching variety mondial the most widely grown potato variety in south africa was planted at both sites seed tubers were planted in rows spaced 0 9 m apart at a target plant density of 40 000 44 000 plants per ha crop emergence was above 50 at 23 days after planting dap in north west and at 25 dap in limpopo table 2 granular water soluble and foliar based fertilizers were applied to the crop during the growing season through a combination of broadcasting before and after planting band placement with planting fertigation and spraying high amounts of nutrients n p k and ca were applied to the crops table 2 and nutrient availability was unlikely to limit crop growth the haulms of the potato crops in north west were killed before the crop fully senesced for marketing reasons in limpopo the crop was allowed to senesce naturally 2 2 data collection an irgason integrated open path co2 h2o gas analyzer ecv system campbell scientific was used to measure the h2o vapour fluxes above the crop canopy it was integrated with a sonic anemometer which measures the three dimensional wind speed the following sensors were added to the system fine wire thermocouple nr lite net radiometer silicon pyranometer krypton hygrometer cs616 reflectometer and hukseflux heat flux plates the ecv system was installed in the fields close to the center with minimal damage to the surrounding potato plants data were sampled at a frequency of 10 hz processed using easyflux dl software campbell scientific and recorded using a cr3000 datalogger the datalogger and ecv system were powered by a 14 v solar charged battery the gas analyzer was installed on a tripod mast at a height of 2 0 m above the soil surface and oriented towards the predominant wind direction this was west in north west and northeast in limpopo the fields 10 20 ha in size were large enough to meet the average fetch requirement of 150 m ecv measurements commenced 29 dap in north west and 26 dap in limpopo which approximately coincided with crop emergence weather data were obtained from automatic weather stations campbell scientific installed at the trial sites fresh tuber yield and tuber dry matter content were measured through destructive sampling at crop maturity the tuber dry matter content was determined from sub samples that were oven dried at 70 c until constant weight the amount of water supplied to the crop was measured using tipping bucket rain gauges texas electronics with data loggers campbell scientific cr200x installed at eight random positions across the field in limpopo and an ultrasonic flow meter flowmetrix mounted onto the pivot water supply line at north west furthermore soil moisture monitoring stations were installed close to the ecv systems at both sites each monitoring station consisted of five capacitance sensors decagon 10hs installed at 10 20 30 40 and 50 cm depth and connected to a datalogger campbell scientific cr200x to facilitate continuous data collection the sensors were calibrated in situ by taking periodic soil samples at corresponding depths and comparing the measured water contents to sensor readings these measurements were used to estimate daily changes in soil water content soil moisture depletion per layer was calculated as the difference between field capacity and measured moisture content of that layer these were then accumulated to obtain the daily soil moisture depletion of the root zone 0 50 cm moreover a drain gauge lysimeter decagon g3 was installed in the field in north west to measure deep drainage beyond 1 0 m depth application efficiency ae of the two centre pivot irrigation systems was measured by comparing the amount of water collected in rain gauges positioned at the soil surface with the volume entering the system according to the procedures by koegelenberg and breedt 2003 the ae determines the fraction of water applied by the sprinklers that reaches the soil surface and gives an indication of wind drift and evaporation losses koegelenberg and breedt 2003 the measured ae of the two systems was 83 in limpopo and 81 in north west table 1 2 3 data handling and analyses quality assurance and control are recommended for ecv measurements foken et al 2012 the measurement system accomplished quality assurance by using diagnostic outputs from the sonic anemometer and infrared gas analyzer the datalogger used raw data for flux calculations only when sensors functioned normally and measurements were within reasonable and calibrated ranges and when signal strengths were adequate the easyflux datalogger program easyflux dl corrected for high and low frequency losses caused by the blocking average for the 30 min intervals systematic corrections were also done for the vertical air velocity due to heat and water vapour transfer in the atmospheric surface layer easyflux dl followed the method presented by foken et al 2012 to grade the relative quality of co2 le h and momentum fluxes the relative non stationarity rn cov relative integral turbulence characteristic itc sw and the wind direction in the sonic instrument coordinate system wnd dir sonic were calculated and used to grade the quality of the data rn cov described the steady state itc sw defined the development of turbulence conditions and wnd dir sonic described the wind direction each covariance variable over the averaging period was assigned an overall quality grade from 1 to 9 based on the individual grades of rn cov itc sw and wnd dir sonic grade 1 was the highest overall quality whilst grade 9 was the poorest the energy balance closure e closure was used to evaluate the accuracy of the ecv measurements the sum of the estimated latent energy le and sensible heat flux h must be equivalent to all other energy sinks and sources net radiation rn and soil heat flux g 1 e closure le h r n g the bowen ratio closure method chávez et al 2009 was used to compensate for discrepancies between rn g and le h around noon between 10 00 and 15 00 when the bowen ratio is assumed constant the calculations followed the procedures detailed by ding et al 2010 the adjusted le was used to estimate daytime crop evapotranspiration etc measured by the ecv daily kc values were calculated following the single crop coefficient method as the ratio of etc measured by the ecv to the reference evapotranspiration eto

rooted zone δs 8 r i et c d s seasonal values of water inputs and outputs were calculated by summing up daily values water balances were assessed from emergence when the ecv system was installed until

regression analyses were used to assess the energy balance closure of the ecv measurements 3 results 3 1 weather conditions and irrigation management in limpopo temperatures during the growing season were relatively cool compared to north west fig 1a as the crop was planted early winter and harvested in spring table 2 temperatures gradually increased during the cropping season only 15 mm of rainfall was received during the season from planting and the crop strongly depended on supplementary irrigation for its water supply table 2 irrigation 4 9 mm per event was applied usually every second day the crop was irrigated less frequently every third day between dae 1 and 14 and daily between dae 90 and 100 when temperatures were relatively high in north west the growing season was also unusually dry with only 19 mm of rainfall received the crop was irrigated almost every day from emergence to crop termination typically receiving 5 8 mm per event the crop was planted in spring and harvested in mid summer with warm maximum day temperatures frequently 35 c from crop emergence until maturity fig 1b solar radiation was higher in nw than in limpopo reflecting the different growing seasons sudden dips in radiation fig 1 were due to cloudy conditions no weather data were obtained at 43 and 82 dae in limpopo vapour pressure deficit vpd during the growing season was generally lower in limpopo than in north west fig 2 due to lower temperatures in limpopo the relative humidity was low during the growing seasons at both sites the seasonal mean vpd was 1 88 kpa in limpopo and 2 35 kpa in north west standard deviation of 0 72 and 0 59 respectively 3 2 energy balances and diurnal courses at the site in limpopo the amount of energy measured by the ecv closely matched the available energy sources and sinks in both the 30 min interval data and the daytime data the regression line closely matched the 1 1 line and only few strong outliers could be observed fig 3 a b c with high correlation coefficients r between rn g and le h of 0 97 for the 30 min and 0 94 for the daytime data the energy discrepancies were larger in north west fig 3 c d e where rn g tended to be larger than le h at higher values more outliers could be observed in the data from north west as reflected by correlation coefficients r of 0 94 for the 30 min and 0 83 for the daytime data the daytime discrepancies were used to correct the daytime le and etc estimations as explained in the methodology daytime rn g was generally higher than le h as the radiant energy received during the daytime resulted in positive rn as energy was supplied to the vegetation surface for evapotranspiration h g and le were also positive during the day as the energy supplied by rn was lost from the surface through heat conduction into the soil heat transfer into the atmosphere and evapotranspiration fig 4 after correction the correlation between rn g and le h was high r 0 96 for the 24 h data from north west fig 3e and the energy imbalance improved from 17 to 4 modest adjustments to etc were made due to corrections of the daytime energy balance and did not have major impact on calculated kc values the mean daily rn in north west 600 700 w m 2 was higher than in limpopo 400 500 w m 2 parent and anctil 2012 also obtained lower values of rn in a cooler season with low radiation and ambient temperature conditions mean temperature 15 2 c total rainfall 563 3 mm at night rn was negative as there was no solar radiation and therefore no energy supplied le indicative of evapotranspiration was minimal at night as the stomata are closed le started to increase after sunrise and largely followed the inclination of the sun reaching a peak just after midday le started to decline before maximum temperatures were reached at 14 00 15 00 indicating that it is more driven by solar radiation than by air temperature the mean le peaked at 367 w m 2 in north west and at 272 w m 2 in limpopo the daytime energy exchange at the crop surface was greater in north west than in limpopo where lower radiation and shorter day lengths occurred in winter the mean diurnal courses of the energy balance components were consistent with what is expected from a crop surface 3 3 water vapour fluxes and crop coefficients the mean daily etc over the growing season was 3 2 mm in limpopo and 5 7 mm in north west these differences in daily etc reflected differences in latent heat flux as governed by weather conditions and day length in limpopo daily eto and etc gradually increased over the growing season fig 5a as temperatures and radiation levels increased with the crop growing into spring fig 1a the correlation between eto and etc was high during the entire season with the exception of the vegetative phase the first 2 weeks after emergence table 3 the high etc and low discrepancy with eto could have been a result of an increase in etc due to low vpd in winter in north west eto and etc were higher fig 5b than in limpopo moreover the discrepancies between eto and etc were larger the discrepancies were relatively large in the beginning of the growing season vegetative growth stage the correlation improved in the growth stages thereafter and etc followed eto more closely table 3 towards the end of the growing cycle etc tended to be lower than eto at both sites the total etc etct over the growing season from emergence based on ecv measurements was 338 mm in limpopo and 466 mm in north west table 4 etct was relatively low in limpopo due to cooler weather conditions during winter at both sites daily kc values were rather variable in the first 2 3 weeks after emergence fig 6 reflecting the discrepancies between eto and etc fig 5 in limpopo kc values were higher in the initial stage even though the crop canopy did not fully cover the soil this could be a result of soil evaporation being the major contributor to etc as observed with the high soil moisture depletion from emergence even though soil was initially at field capacity pereira et al 2021 thereafter when the crop canopy fully covered the soil kc values were fairly stable at both sites fig 6 table 3 kc values slightly declined towards the end of the growing cycle presumably because the crop senesced and photosynthesized and transpired less actively the average kc values for the entire growing season from crop emergence were 0 99 in limpopo and 0 78 in north west table 3 where kc values were consistently lower than in limpopo fig 6 the observed maximum kc values were lower than the general upper limit for crops suggested by allen et al 2011a 2011b of 1 4 for a grass reference base of etc in arid climates 3 4 water balances and use efficiencies at both sites the water holding capacity of the sandy soils was relatively low while the maximum rooting depth of the crop was estimated at 60 cm the soil was approximately at field capacity at emergence at both sites in limpopo the soil moisture depletion in the rooted zone increased gradually from emergence reaching a maximum of 32 mm at 55 dae and declined thereafter fig 7 at full senescence the soil water content was almost similar to that at emergence although drainage was not assessed at the site in limpopo drainage was likely small and if it occurred it was probably around or before emergence or during the final days of senescence in north west the soil water deficit in the rooted zone increased over the growing season reaching 65 mm at crop maturity fig 7 no drainage was observed in the drainage lysimeter during the growing season table 4 which was in line with the soil moisture data showing increasing deficits only after harvest rainfall led to some measured drainage data not shown even though irrigation in north west was more frequent and almost applied daily the higher daily maximum temperatures led to higher etc and soil moisture depletion fig 7 the inputs and outputs of water in the soil from emergence to crop senescence was rather balanced at both sites with estimated total inputs being close to the total outputs table 4 the site in limpopo yielded 64 t fresh tuber ha 1 table 5 the tuber dry matter content in limpopo was 18 8 resulting in 12 0 t dry tuber ha 1 table 5 the site in north west provided 76 t fresh tuber ha 1 with a dry matter percentage of 18 5 resulting in 14 1 t dry tuber ha 1 although the growing period in north west was relatively short high radiation levels resulted in a high yield despite a lower yield the crop in limpopo had a higher wueet and wuer i than the crop in north west table 5 however after normalizing wue for vpd the wue achieved in north west was higher than in limpopo table 5 this is discussed in more detail below 4 discussion because of the large fetch of the ecv system and the high frequency of sampling the direct etc measurements by an ecv system can be more representative for a field than etc estimates based on soil water balance approaches however the commonly observed discrepancies in the energy balance can raise questions about the reliability of ecv measurements widmoser and wohlfahrt 2018 at both sites in this study the infra red gas analyzer was calibrated just before installation in the field and observed discrepancies in the energy balance were unlikely due to inaccurate measurements by the analyzer the wider discrepancies in the data from north west may be partly due to more turbulent weather conditions typically occurring in spring and summer highly turbulent conditions can reduce measurement accuracy parent and anctil 2012 anapalli et al 2018 the ecv measurements of le and h represented a larger area of the field whereas rn and g were local measurements and this could have contributed to the lack of closure of the energy balance imbalances could also have been caused by an under estimation of g in north west due to the relatively dry soil conditions from 40 dae until crop senescence under such conditions g could be up to 50 of rn whilst le and h will be low heusinkveld et al 2004 in case g is under estimated the available energy for turbulent fluxes will be over estimated seasonal soil water inputs and outputs were well balanced at both sites suggesting that the etc measurements by the ecv systems were fairly accurate etct over the growing seasons compared well with et values determined using soil water balance methods under comparable conditions steyn et al 2007 reported an etct of potato in a comparable semi arid climate in pretoria south africa of 579 mm for a summer crop and 360 mm for an autumn crop ferreira and carr 2002 reported etct values of 325 mm and 569 mm for short and long season crops harvested 88 and 117 dae in a hot and dry climate in this study the observed day to day variations in eto and etc were clearly related to each other however the strength of the relationship between eto and etc and thus the stability of the kc value depended on crop growth stage the relationship between eto and etc was stronger and kc values were more stable when the crop had a full canopy and the crop grew at maximum capacity in the middle of the growing season fig 5 table 3 a poorer correlation between etc and eto at both sites just after emergence was likely related to the low soil cover during this growth stage eto is indicative for etc when a crop has reached full soil cover if part of the soil is bare evapotranspiration is more driven by evaporation which is difficult to predict based on weather variables as it depends on factors such as the humidity and albedo of the soil surface at low soil cover spikes in soil evaporation may occur directly after each wetting irrigation rain event pereira et al 2021 these spikes contribute to the day to day variation in etc towards the end of the growing season when the crop senesced and leaves physiologically aged discrepancies between eto and etc became somewhat larger and kc values slightly declined this was likely the result of crop senescence and the associated reduction in photosynthesis and transpiration rates in limpopo a stronger correlation between eto and etc and higher kc values were observed compared to the results from north west table 3 in limpopo soil moisture measurements throughout the season suggested that crop growth was unlikely limited by water availability in north west however soil moisture deficits in the rooted zone increased throughout the season and crop growth was probably limited by water availability this difference in drought stress between the two sites was in line with visual assessments of the crops the occasional drought stress in north west explains the observed weaker correlation between eto and etc moreover drought stress may explain the lower kc values in north west furthermore high temperatures as experienced in spring and summer in north west lead to decreased leaf and stomatal conductance and increased vpd fig 2 limiting plant transpiration under conditions of high atmospheric demand marin et al 2016 xu et al 2018 when the atmospheric evaporative demand is high as indicated by a high vapour pressure deficit plants may partially close their stomata to reduce transpiration fernandes silva et al 2016 anapalli et al 2018 marin et al 2019 so besides the impact of water stress the lower kc values in north west may have been due to this stomatal response to the high air temperatures tmax 30 c crop management at both sites was such that the crops were unlikely to suffer significant nutrient pest or disease related stresses any stresses that affect the crop most likely also affect kc values the measured kc values at both sites fell within the variability reported by other studies though the values observed in limpopo were relatively high table 6 allen et al 1998 noted that weather based evapotranspiration equations are not expected to perfectly predict etc under different climatic conditions due to simplification in formulation and errors in measurements of air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed mean kc values should remain relatively stable during a specific growth stage in case the crop is well watered as was observed during the tuber initiation and bulking stages covering most of the growing season the results indicated that eto derived from weather variables can be used to estimate etc of potato and water requirements for irrigation management bandyopadhyay et al 2003 anapalli et al 2018 however estimations of the actual irrigation water requirement should take into account the soil type and effective precipitation and can be substantially more than evapotranspiration due to other losses such as irrigation inefficiencies drainage and run off testa et al 2011 seidel et al 2019 in the absence of rainfall farmers using appropriate irrigation scheduling tools can accurately match irrigation amounts with crop demand reducing water losses to a minimum even on well draining sandy soils as observed in this study heavy rainfall events mostly occurring in summer in the study region can lead to substantial drainage which may cause an imbalance between water input and evapotranspiration this type of drainage cannot be avoided through improved irrigation management the high tuber yields achieved in north west table 5 indicated that the crop was only mildly affected by drought stress in general a drought stressed crop is expected to use water more efficiently than a crop free of water stress however the observed wueet and the wuer i of the crop in limpopo were higher than in north west cooler ambient temperatures in winter in limpopo resulted in a lower vpd fig 2 and likely a lower transpiration by the crop for a certain amount of co2 absorbed steyn et al 2007 also reported higher transpirational wue in the cooler season autumn than a warmer season spring when wue was normalized for vpd the wue in north west was somewhat higher than in limpopo this difference is likely related to the conditions of drought stress experienced by the crop in north west reducing crop transpiration 5 conclusions this study is the first application of ecv techniques in potato crops planted in different seasons in a semi arid climate etc had a distinct seasonal pattern with a gradual increase from emergence reaching a peak at full canopy cover tuber bulking stages and declining later in season as the crop matured and senesced tuber maturity stage seasonal kc values for the spring and winter crops were 0 78 and 0 99 respectively while eto served as a good indicator of the day to day patterns in etc measured by the ecv system the seasonal kc values varied considerably between winter and spring summer crops this suggests that eto which can be relatively easily estimated based on data from a weather station can be used for irrigation scheduling of potato but kc values used to estimate crop evapotranspiration may need to be adjusted depending on the cropping season wueet and wuer i of potato were higher for the crop growing in the cooler winter compared to the crop growing in spring summer despite higher yields and a modest irrigation regime in the spring summer crop to optimize wue of potato in water scarce areas that rely mostly on irrigation water for potato production it is advisable to grow potato crops in the coolest growing season for south africa that is winter in frost free areas and the first planting window in spring in frost prone areas further studies should focus on collecting etc and eto data in different climates and seasons so as to improve our understanding if and how kc of potato is affected by weather and crop management conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare

tha 1 for the two sites full irrigation was effective in reducing moisture stress and thereby increasing sorghum yield by up to 3 tha 1 for kobo and 2 tha 1 for meisso on average full irrigation resulted in a 1 tha 1 yield increase compared with deficit irrigation early planting dates also resulted in an increase in yield compared to the baseline planting dates especially when combined with supplemental irrigation although late planting was consistently disadvantageous even with supplemental irrigation this study highlighted that the csm ceres sorghum model can be effectively used to simulate climate change effects on sorghum yield and evaluate different climate change adaptation practices the outcomes of this study can also help to implement management decisions towards climate

farming ethiopia 1 introduction sorghum is the fifth most important cereal crop in the world after wheat maize rice and barley mejia and lewis 1999 mundia et al 2019 it is the second major crop after maize in africa taylor 2003 and it is considered to have been first domesticated in north africa possibly in ethiopia around 1000 before christ b c doggett 2009 due to its unique nature of drought resistance compared to other cereals sorghum is the most common food grain crop in sub saharan africa obilana 1994 as a result it is widely grown in arid and semi arid regions of africa including in the east african highlands characterized by a monsoon rainfall season with a non uniform rainfall distribution the average production of sorghum in africa has shown a steady increase from 11 6 in 1976 to 20 9 million tons in 2001 taylor 2003 this increase in sorghum production is primarily attributed to increases in acreage in africa in particular ethiopia kinfe and tesfaye 2018 taylor 2003 however only traditional cultivar varieties are commonly grown and average sorghum yield remains below 1 tha 1 because of insufficient inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides and subsistence farming practices ahmed et al 2000 to meet increasing food demand due to population pressure sorghum production is being expanded into environmentally sensitive areas matlon 1990 phalan et al 2013 this practice is unsustainable and efforts must be made to increase sorghum yield without expanding farmlands into vulnerable regions in contrast in places where intensive agriculture is practiced with improved technologies and inputs such as hybrid seeds fertilizer and chemical inputs sorghum yield is much higher and is comparable with other major cereals amelework et al 2016 o sullivan 2015 potgieter et al 2016 schoof 2015 as the effect of climate change and variability intensifies agricultural productivity is being significantly impacted and food security continues to be a daunting task alemu and mengistu 2019 o sullivan 2015 schoof 2015 multiple studies have shown that east africa in general and especially ethiopia are among the most vulnerable regions to climate change and variability alemu and mengistu 2019 cooper and coe 2011 rosell 2011 climate change is projected to result in extreme weather events such as severe droughts coe and stern 2011 cooper and coe 2011 haile et al 2020 rosell 2011 and shifts in spatial and temporal rainfall distributions and intensities conway and schipper 2011 dixit et al 2011 fotso nguemo et al 2019 several studies have reported a strong linkage between climate change and variability and the overall performance of ethiopia s economy which mainly depends on a rainfed and subsistence agricultural sector that accounts for 41 of the gross domestic product gdp and over 85 of employment world bank 2006 given such a heavy dependence of the agricultural system on rainfall variations in the timing of the monsoon rainfall season and occurrence of extreme events such as drought and floods pose significant threats to the fragile agricultural sector and thereby the food security of the nation a strong relationship has been reported between annual rainfall variability and the fluctuation of gdp coe and stern 2011 suryabhagavan 2017 climate change also caused the greatest challenges to ethiopian agriculture due to increased frequencies and intensities of droughts and extreme rainfall events haile et al 2020 suryabhagavan 2017 although sorghum is well known for its drought tolerance which can grow on marginalized lands climate change and variability are expected to have a negative impact on sorghum production in ethiopia the arid and semiarid regions of ethiopia where sorghum is widely grown are projected to experience unpredictable and highly variable rainfall strong winds high temperature and high evapotranspiration fazzini et al 2015 which in turn will impact sorghum production merga et al 2014 in addition there is limited information on adaptation practices that could be implemented to potentially reduce the impacts of climate change and variability on sorghum production the objectives of this study were to i investigate the potential impact of climate change on sorghum yield under rainfed production systems and ii evaluate the effectiveness of supplemental irrigation to the current rainfed production system and shifting planting dates as adaptation practices for two major sorghum producing regions in ethiopia 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites this study was conducted at kobo 40 15 n 9 24 e and meisso 39 39 n 12 9 e which are located in the northern and eastern regions of ethiopia fig 1 these lowland areas are characterized by a semi arid climate with high rainfall variability and frequent droughts that affect crop productivity significantly nevertheless the rainfed agricultural system remains the main livelihood of smallholder farmers the average farm size in both locations is very small and thus subsistence farming is dominant headey et al 2014 smallholder farmers opt for low risk cropping systems and rely heavily on drought tolerant crops such as sorghum long term average minimum and maximum temperatures are 14 8 and 29 8 c for kobo and 14 9 and 30 8 c for meisso both study sites have bimodal rainfall distributions with very short rainfall seasons between march and may while the main rainy season occurs from june to september jjas fig 2 however rainfall distributions are erratic and water scarcity is prevalent on average annual rainfall for kobo is 653 and for meisso is 825 mm 2 2 field experiment data field experimental data from 2005 to 2014 except for 2008 and 2009 on sorghum phenology yield and biomass were obtained from the melkassa agricultural research center marc this study was conducted as part of a national sorghum variety trial in meisso fig 1 a randomized complete block design was used with 3 replications each plot had an area of 15 m2 3 m width 5 m length the cultivar teshale that was used in this study is the most widely grown medium maturing cultivar in the lowland areas of ethiopia this cultivar was released by the ethiopian institute of agricultural research eiar as part of its efforts for climate change adaptation options for arid and semi arid regions of ethiopia planting was done using a spacing of 75 cm between rows and 15 cm between plants the planting depth was 5 cm and the planting density was about 9 plantsm 2 during this experiment planting was done after the onset of the rainy season once sufficient moisture is available in the soil to support germination however due to erratic rainfall distribution short and extended dry spells are common in most places a short dry spell even during the rainy season significantly affects yield and thus irrigation is critical agronomic practices included a split application of fertilizer that consists of 100 kgha 1 diammonium phosphate dap and 50 kgha 1 of urea at planting and 50 kgha 1 of urea thirty days after planting approximately at five leaf stage the necessary management data for model calibration and evaluations were recorded 2 3 crop model simulation the cropping system model csm ceres sorghum model jones et al 2003 white et al 2015 of the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat hoogenboom et al 2019 is one of the widely used crop simulation models in this study the ceres crop estimation through resource and environment synthesis sorghum model within the dssat 4 7 6 was used the csm ceres sorghum model simulates crop growth development and yield based on defined datasets of management weather soil parameters and genetic coefficients of specific cultivars the model also allows for the simulation of a dynamic plant and soil water nitrogen phosphorus carbon balance and the impact of best management practices on crop yield and yield components adam et al 2018 crop management practices such as cultivar type planting date fertilizer application time and rate plant density sowing depth etc were accurately represented during the model setup local farmers fertilizer and tillage practices were followed and the teshale cultivar was sown at a density of 9 plantsm 2 with 100 kg ha 1 dap and 50 kg ha 1 of urea during sowing and an additional 50 kg ha 1 urea 30 days after sowing were applied initial soil conditions for nodule and root weight were set at 10 kg ha 1 each with 50 of the residue incorporated in the top 3 cm of soil the model was calibrated and evaluated based on field experimental data before it was used to evaluate potential climate change impact on sorghum yield and evaluate the effectiveness of selected climate change adaptation practices for two sites selected in this study 2 4 weather and soil data daily minimum and maximum temperatures rainfall and radiation data for the two study sites were obtained from the national meteorology agency of ethiopia nma soil profile data for kobo and meisso sites were obtained from marc soil data have seven to eight different horizons with defined physical and chemical properties at each layer table 1 soils at both sites have slightly basic ph 7 6 7 8 with relatively low organic matter contents 0 9 1 5 a clay loam texture was dominant on the top 15 cm of soil at both sites table 1 2 5 climate change scenarios future climate change scenarios were created following the agricultural model intercomparison and improvement project agmip protocol which uses the delta statistics approach hudson and ruane 2015 future climate scenarios were produced for three future periods 2025s 2010 2039 2055s 2040 2069 and 2085s 2070 2099 based on agricultural model intercomparison and improvement project agmip protocol rosenzweig et al 2015 from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 and two representative concentration pathways rcps rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 five representative gcms were selected out of the 20 gcms that are available in the agmip climate scenario hudson and ruane 2015 scatter plots of mean temperature and rainfall changes during the crop growing season with reference to the baseline period were used to select five representative gcms for each site fig 3 the five gcms were chosen to represent the five quadrants in the scatter plot designated as cool wet cool dry middle hot wet and hot dry ruane and mcdermid 2017 tables 2 and 3 in addition based on the agmip regional climate assessment protocol co2 concentrations were set at 423 for 2025 499 for 2055 and 532 ppm for 2085 for rcp4 5 and 532 ppm and 432 571 and 801 ppm for rcp8 5 in 2025s 2055s and 2085s periods respectively rosenzweig et al 2017 2 6 model calibration and evaluation the model was calibrated using five years 2005 2007 and 2010 2011 and evaluated with three years 2011 2013 experimental data model calibration involved fine tuning model parameters related to soil properties climatic characteristics and plant growth parameters so that simulated values compared buddhaboon et al 2018 hunt et al 1993 reasonably well with observed data hoogenboom et al 2012 timsina and humphreys 2006 in addition to the species and eco type parameters seven genetic coefficients were used to define traits that differentiate cultivars within a crop species the genetic coefficient calculator gencalc was used to estimate the genotype specific coefficient for dssat crop model román paoli et al 2000 in gencalc the coefficients of a genotype are estimated iteratively by running the appropriate crop model anothai et al 2008 hunt et al 1993 jones et al 2011 genotype coefficients of the sorghum cultivar were estimated from a base cultivar coefficient that exists in the dssat database which resembles cultivar teshale with respect to maturity the iteration continues until the model simulation fits well with the observed data set anothai et al 2008 the genotype coefficients were determined in a specified sequence starting with those related to crop development followed by yield and yield components model performance evaluations were done during calibration and evaluation using the coefficient of determination

alleviating the negative impacts of climate change on moisture stress and sorghum yield were evaluated sorghum planting date in the historical baseline periods was started on the onset of the main rainfall seasons third week of june see fig 2 kassie et al 2013 has conducted survey about the farmers management practices in kobo and he indicated that the farmers usually started planting when the main rainy seasons started we have also analyzed the historical rainfall conditions of both locations and it depicted that the main rainy seasons was started in june particularly jun 21 for kobo and jun 18 for meisso fig 2 in this paper the baseline planting date was also determined to be june 21 for kobo and june 18 for meisso getachew et al 2016 kassie et al 2013 planting dates were selected by shifting the baseline plating dates by about 10 days forward and backward resulting in nine planting dates between early may to the end of july in addition deficit and full irrigation treatments were set based on daily root zone moisture balance deficit supplemental irrigation was set to trigger when percent available water content pawc reaches 25 and irrigation will be applied only up to 75 of pawc while the full irrigation refill point was 50 pawc and was set to refill 100 optimal irrigation refill points are mostly recommended at 50 pawc to avoid any moisture stress to the plant under limited moisture availability actual evapotranspiration eta will be reduced and smaller than the potential evapotranspiration etp the csm ceres sorghum model simulates drought stress as proportion of potential demand to the potential supply of water to the plant for photosynthesis and the phenomenon is expressed as the moisture stress index for photosynthesis wspd jones et al 2003 the value of wspd ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 is no stress and 1 is maximum stress 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the csm ceres sorghum model results showed that the model was able to simulate anthesis maturity and grain yield very well for both calibration and evaluation table 4 the model performed well in simulating days to anthesis r2 0 73 nrmse 2 98 days to maturity r2 0 59 nrmse 3 58 and grain yield r2 0 76 nrmse 5 11 during the calibration similarly the model performance well during evaluation of anthesis r2 0 86 nrmse 1 27 maturity r2 0 79 nrmse 2 69 and grain yield r2 0 99 nrmse 6 45 moreover d values were greater than 0 61 which indicate that good agreement between observed and simulated values according to jamieson et al 1991 nrmse values 10 show that the overall performance of the model was excellent calibrated and evaluated genetic coefficients are summarized in table 5 3 2 projected climate change projected climate change results showed that average temperature will increase for the three future periods 2025s 2055s and 2085s as simulated by the five gcms for the two rcps fig 4a average temperature is projected to consistently increase for all scenarios and periods for both locations and is expected to show a steady increase with the progression of the 21st century the projected increase in average temperature during the crop growing season was estimated to reach up to 6 c for rcp8 5 in the 2085s for both study sites fig 4a however the projections for precipitation were mixed with an increase and decrease for the two sites in most hot wet and cool wet climate conditions under all rcps and periods fig 4b the highest increases in total precipitation during the crop growing season were projected in 2085s and rcp 8 5 for hot wet climate conditions overall hot wet climate conditions showed consistent increases in precipitation for both locations but increases were higher for kobo than meisso fig 4b consistent increases in projected precipitation was observed under hot dry scenarios with the progression of the century the hot dry and cool dry scenarios showed modest reductions in precipitation while the cool wet and hot wet scenarios showed increases compared to the baseline period fig 4b our results were in agreement with previous studies from ethiopia where findings have constantly shown that temperature would considerably increase while mixed projections were reported for rainfall conway and schipper 2011 napa 2007 a study at kobo by kassie et al 2014 kassie 2014 reported that projected annual rainfall would vary from 40 to 10 compared to the baseline while the average annual temperature would increase by up to 4 1 c by the 2080s fig 4a kassie 2014 also indicated that seasonal rainfall for kobo will increase during november december while during the main sorghum growing season rainfall will decrease by 12 35 similarly a study in southern tigray reported that minimum and maximum temperatures would both increase by up to 6 c towards the end of this century hadgu et al 2015 arndt et al 2011 found that in the 2080s rainfall in ethiopia will decline by up to 20 during the main rainy season compared to the 1960 1990 period 3 3 sorghum yield projection yield projections for rainfed production systems showed a considerable decrease for all climate change scenarios except for a few projected increases for the hot wet cool wet and cool dry climate scenarios for two periods fig 5 overall a larger reduction in yield was projected for meisso compared to the baseline period fig 5 among the climate scenarios considered the hot dry scenario is projected to result in the largest reduction in yield across all locations periods and rcps fig 5 these results are in agreement with findings from previous studies in the region multiple studies on crop production projected considerable yield reduction particularly in sub saharan africa including ethiopia akinseye et al 2020 kassie et al 2014 ipcc 2007 estimated that climate change would result in a 50 reduction in rainfed agricultural production in east africa by 2020 the report by ipcc showed that an increase of temperature by 1 2 c could likely have a negative impact on major cereal crops in lower latitude regions than higher latitude where the crops are already grown near their maximum temperature tolerance e g 35 c for sorghum the report suggested that agricultural productivity decreases due to less favorable weather conditions reduced water availability for irrigation increased heat stress and prolonged droughts waithaka et al 2013 also stated that temperature increase would lead to an increase in evapotranspiration and thereby an increase in drought stress causing a reduction in yield their work showed that rainfed sorghum yield would decrease over a very large area in the western and northwestern parts of ethiopia with up to a 5 25 reduction in sorghum yield for the western parts of tigray and amhara region of ethiopia this reduction in yield in addition to an already sub optimal farm productivity could have a significant impact on the food security and the fragile economy 3 4 effect of planting date on crop moisture stress for the rainfed production system severe moisture stress 0 75 1 0 was prevalent during most of the sorghum growth period starting at emergence to anthesis for both sites fig 6 however anthesis was the most affected stage by moisture stress across all rcps and periods up to 80 days of severe moisture stress 0 75 1 0 per crop season were observed for kobo fig 6a while for meisso it could reach as high as 125 days per season fig 6b moisture stress was relatively small during germination end of panicle growth and maturity one notable observation was that moisture stress tends to decrease under rcp8 5 compared to rcp4 5 in 2055s and 2085s this could be due to an increase projected rainfall and co2 concentration the increase in co2 concentration could potentially result in reduced moisture stress due to a reduction in transpiration rates studies have shown that elevated co2 concentration reduces moisture stress leakey 2009 overall the effect of planting date on moisture stress showed mixed results both early and late planting dates showed both an increase and decrease in moisture stress similarly there was no difference between climate scenarios in moisture stress mastrorilli et al 1995 reported that moisture stress during the sorghum flowering stage had the most significant effect on yield therefore the stress that occurs around the flowering stages could be used as an indicator of yield reduction however it should be also noted that moisture stress during other sorghum physiological developmental stages can also have a negative effect on sorghum yield kothari et al 2020 other studies have reported that rainfed sorghum production would be negatively impacted by climate change due to high moisture stress in these areas kassie et al 2014 argued that rainfall and temperature projections in northern ethiopia could be an indication that climate change could have a significant effect on rainfed sorghum production they also reported that a decrease in rainfall during sorghum growth season coupled with a warming temperature trend will further exacerbate moisture stress however as discussed previously early planting dates had a positive impact on sorghum yield for both locations especially when combined with supplemental irrigation which suggests its potential use as climate change adaptation practice shifting planting date has been tested as climate change adaptation practices for different crops such as rice dharmarathna et al 2014 sorghum akinseye et al 2020 wheat nouri et al 2017 maize ahmad et al 2020 and other crops 3 5 effect of supplemental irrigation on crop moisture stress as expected supplemental irrigation to the current rainfed production system resulted in considerable reductions in moisture stress for the two study sites fig 7 reduction in moisture stress from supplemental irrigation was proportional to irrigation level with full irrigation resulting in complete moisture stress free days throughout the crop growing season deficit irrigation also resulted in a reduction of moisture stress by up to 50 days per season and most importantly the stress days were sparsely distributed across the crop growth period alleviating the stress during anthesis which was the most affected growth stage fig 7 the effectiveness of deficit irrigation in reducing moisture stress was slightly higher in meisso fig 7b than kobo fig 7a reductions in moisture stress frequencies and severities from the deficit and full supplemental irrigation to the current rainfed production systems for both locations would result in an increase in sorghum yield on average deficit and full irrigation for kobo resulted in 16 and 22 irrigation events which were equivalent to 231 and 348 mm of total irrigation during the crop growth season respectively similarly for meisso deficit and full irrigation on average required 346 and 491 mm which were applied over 18 and 21 irrigation events respectively table 6 3 6 effect of supplemental irrigation and planting date on sorghum yield the reduction in the frequency of moisture stress and severity due to implementation of deficit and full supplemental irrigation practices to the current rainfed production systems were also reflected by projected increase in sorghum yield for both sites figs 8 and 9 the increase was sufficiently high to offset the projected reduction in yield of up 2 tha 1 and resulted in a net yield increase for all climate change scenarios and periods figs 8 and 9 full irrigation was effective in reducing moisture stress and thereby increasing sorghum yield by up to 3 tha 1 for kobo and 2 tha 1 for meisso on average the yield difference between deficit and full irrigation was about 1 tha 1 our findings were in agreement with several studies that showed the effectiveness of irrigation as climate change adaptation practice finger et al 2011 kassie et al 2015 muluneh et al 2017 for the rainfed production system sorghum yield percentage change was estimated to be 4 7 3 in the 2025s 2055s 2085s respectively at kobo under rcp4 5 meanwhile it would be 28 18 30 in the 2025s 2055s 2085s respectively at meisso under rcp4 5 compared to the baseline as we applied deficit irrigation the sorghum production would projected to increase by 50 36 33 in the 2025s 2055s 2085s respectively at kobo under rcp4 5 while it would increase 39 33 24 in the 2025s 2055s 2085s respectively at meisso under rcp4 5 compared to the baseline the sorghum production even goes higher as we applied full irrigation in both locations among the five climate conditions cool wet and cool dry conditions resulted in higher yield while hot dry conditions resulted in the lowest yield even with supplemental irrigation between the two locations the yield was higher and more variable for kobo than for meisso similarly yield differences among climate scenarios were higher in kobo than meisso fig 8 overall the average yield for the two locations was consistently higher under rcp4 5 than rcp8 5 figs 8 and 9 this could be due to increased co2 concentration which favors high biomass production that may not necessarily lead to an increase in grain yield ottman et al 2001 reported that elevation of co2 concentration increases sorghum biomass production in drier areas ottman et al 2001 increases in co2 concentration have shown both positive and negative effects on sorghum kothari et al 2020 for example results from the free air co2 enrichment face experiments at maricopa arizona ottman et al 2001 and open top field chamber studies at auburn alabama prior et al 2003 reported both increases and reductions of grain sorghum yield from elevation of co2 concentrations early planting dates tend to increase crop yield compared to the baseline planting dates june 21 for kobo and june 18 for meisso and late planting dates under rainfed or with supplemental irrigation production systems figs 8 and 9 however the effects of early planting were higher when implemented with irrigation than under rainfed similar studies have also reported that early planting dates were beneficial in increasing early maturing sorghum cultivars akinseye et al 2020 it is also worth noting that results varied between the five climate scenarios where cool wet and hot wet scenarios resulting in higher yield increases affordability of adaptation practices is equally important as their effectiveness for wider implementation by smallholder farmers these findings would have significant practical implications as farmers could easily implement such adaptation practices for climate change in northern ethiopia a study by gebrekiros et al 2016 estimated that under current panting dates future sorghum yield would decrease between 5 and 24 compared to the baseline period gebrekiros et al 2016 4 conclusion our results showed that average temperature will increase by up to 6 c for both study sites meanwhile rainfall projections showed mixed results where reductions and increases were estimated compared to the baseline period for both locations under the current rainfed production system crop moisture stress is also projected to intensify especially during crop anthesis which in turn negatively affects sorghum yield overall the sorghum yield under the rainfed production system was very low 6 2 t ha 1 average yield projections also show reductions for both sites which highlights the need for climate change adaptation practices that could help increase sorghum yield these identified impacts of climate change on moisture stress status by crop growth stages will allow farmers to apply a targeted irrigation and still possibly achieve optimal yield irrespective of the projected climate moreover it will also provide critical information to breeders to develop improved cultivars that can adapt the impacts of climate change results from this study show that irrigation could play a significant role in tackling moisture stress frequency and severity and thereby increase sorghum yield the yield increase was positively correlated with increases in supplemental irrigation from rainfed to the deficit and full irrigation full irrigation was effective in increasing sorghum yield by up to 3 tha 1 for kobo and 2 tha 1 for meisso on average yield difference between deficit and full irrigation was about 1 tha 1 similarly early planting dates tend to increase crop yield especially when implemented with supplemental irrigation overall results from this study would help to inform policy and management decisions towards climate change adaptation efforts as such these findings would have significant practical implications as smallholder farmers need adaptation practices that could be implemented easily with small or no capital investment in this regard shifting planting dates should be investigated further as potential climate change adaptation practices not only for sorghum but also for other staple crops in addition future studies should investigate irrigation water availability for supplemental irrigation cost benefit analysis the feasibility of small scale irrigation schemes that can be implemented at smallholder farm levels

9991,climate change is projected to have a global impact that affect food production and security the objectives of this study were to determine the potential impact of climate change on sorghum yield for rainfed production systems and to evaluate the potential of irrigation and shifting planting dates as adaptation options for two major sorghum production regions in ethiopia the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat cropping system model csm ceres sorghum model was used to simulate the impact of climate change on sorghum yield for two representative concentration pathways rcps rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 and for three future periods including the 2025s 2010 2039 2055s 2040 2069 and 2085s 2070 2099 the agricultural model improvement and inter comparison project agmip framework was used to select five representative gcms for hot dry cool dry middle hot wet and cool wet climate scenarios two climate change adaptation practices including supplemental irrigation at two levels deficit and full to the current rainfed production system and shifting planting dates were evaluated the csm ceres sorghum model was calibrated and evaluated using eight years of experimental data from meisso eastern ethiopia the model was then run for kobo and meisso under different climate change and crop management scenarios based on model evaluation results the model performed well for simulating sorghum yield r 2 0 99 anthesis r 2 0 86 rmse 1 3 and maturity r 2 0 79 rmse 4 4 the results showed that the average temperature for kobo and meisso is expected to increase by up to 6 c under rcp8 5 in 2085 for the rainfed production systems without adaptation practices drought stress is projected to intensify during anthesis which was reflected by projected yield reductions by up 2 tha 1 for the two sites full irrigation was effective in reducing moisture stress and thereby increasing sorghum yield by up to 3 tha 1 for kobo and 2 tha 1 for meisso on average full irrigation resulted in a 1 tha 1 yield increase compared with deficit irrigation early planting dates also resulted in an increase in yield compared to the baseline planting dates especially when combined with supplemental irrigation although late planting was consistently disadvantageous even with supplemental irrigation this study highlighted that the csm ceres sorghum model can be effectively used to simulate climate change effects on sorghum yield and evaluate different climate change adaptation practices the outcomes of this study can also help to implement management decisions towards climate

farming ethiopia 1 introduction sorghum is the fifth most important cereal crop in the world after wheat maize rice and barley mejia and lewis 1999 mundia et al 2019 it is the second major crop after maize in africa taylor 2003 and it is considered to have been first domesticated in north africa possibly in ethiopia around 1000 before christ b c doggett 2009 due to its unique nature of drought resistance compared to other cereals sorghum is the most common food grain crop in sub saharan africa obilana 1994 as a result it is widely grown in arid and semi arid regions of africa including in the east african highlands characterized by a monsoon rainfall season with a non uniform rainfall distribution the average production of sorghum in africa has shown a steady increase from 11 6 in 1976 to 20 9 million tons in 2001 taylor 2003 this increase in sorghum production is primarily attributed to increases in acreage in africa in particular ethiopia kinfe and tesfaye 2018 taylor 2003 however only traditional cultivar varieties are commonly grown and average sorghum yield remains below 1 tha 1 because of insufficient inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides and subsistence farming practices ahmed et al 2000 to meet increasing food demand due to population pressure sorghum production is being expanded into environmentally sensitive areas matlon 1990 phalan et al 2013 this practice is unsustainable and efforts must be made to increase sorghum yield without expanding farmlands into vulnerable regions in contrast in places where intensive agriculture is practiced with improved technologies and inputs such as hybrid seeds fertilizer and chemical inputs sorghum yield is much higher and is comparable with other major cereals amelework et al 2016 o sullivan 2015

alemu and mengistu 2019 o sullivan 2015 schoof 2015 multiple studies have shown that east africa in general and especially ethiopia are among the most vulnerable regions to climate change and variability alemu and mengistu 2019 cooper and coe 2011 rosell 2011 climate change is projected to result in extreme weather events such as severe droughts coe and stern 2011 cooper and coe 2011 haile et al 2020 rosell 2011 and shifts in spatial and temporal rainfall distributions and intensities conway and schipper 2011 dixit et al 2011 fotso nguemo et al 2019 several studies have reported a strong linkage between climate change and variability and the overall performance of ethiopia s economy which mainly depends on a rainfed and subsistence agricultural sector that accounts for 41 of the gross domestic product gdp and over 85 of employment world bank 2006 given such a heavy dependence of the agricultural system on rainfall variations in the timing of the monsoon rainfall season and occurrence of extreme events such as drought and floods pose significant threats to the fragile agricultural sector and thereby the food security of the nation a strong relationship has been reported between annual rainfall variability and the fluctuation of gdp coe and stern 2011 suryabhagavan 2017 climate change also caused the greatest challenges to ethiopian agriculture due to increased frequencies and intensities of droughts and extreme rainfall events haile et al 2020 suryabhagavan 2017 although sorghum is well known for its drought tolerance which can grow on marginalized lands climate change and variability are expected to have a negative impact on sorghum production in ethiopia the arid and semiarid regions of ethiopia where sorghum is widely grown are projected to experience unpredictable and highly variable rainfall strong winds high temperature and high evapotranspiration fazzini et al 2015 which in turn will impact sorghum production merga et al 2014 in addition there is limited information on adaptation practices that could be implemented to potentially reduce the impacts of climate change and variability on sorghum production the objectives of this study were to i investigate the potential impact of climate change on sorghum yield under rainfed production systems and ii evaluate the effectiveness of supplemental irrigation to the current rainfed production system and shifting planting dates as adaptation practices for two major sorghum producing regions in ethiopia 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites this study was conducted at kobo 40 15 n 9 24 e and meisso 39 39 n 12 9 e which are located in the northern and eastern regions of ethiopia fig 1 these lowland areas are characterized by a semi arid climate with high rainfall variability and frequent droughts that affect crop productivity significantly nevertheless the rainfed agricultural system remains the main livelihood of smallholder farmers the average farm size in both locations is very small and thus subsistence farming is dominant headey et al 2014 smallholder farmers opt for low risk cropping systems and rely heavily on drought tolerant crops such as sorghum long term average minimum and maximum temperatures are 14 8 and 29 8 c for kobo and 14 9 and 30 8 c for meisso both study sites have bimodal rainfall distributions with very short rainfall seasons between march and may while the main rainy season occurs from june to september jjas fig 2 however rainfall distributions are erratic and water scarcity is prevalent on average annual rainfall for kobo is 653 and for meisso is 825 mm 2 2 field experiment data field experimental data from 2005 to 2014 except for 2008 and 2009 on sorghum phenology yield and biomass were obtained from the melkassa agricultural research center marc this study was conducted as part of a national sorghum variety trial in meisso fig 1 a randomized complete block design was used with 3 replications each plot had an area of 15 m2 3 m width 5 m length the cultivar teshale that was used in this study is the most widely grown medium maturing cultivar in the lowland areas of ethiopia this cultivar was released by the ethiopian institute of agricultural research eiar as part of its efforts for climate change adaptation options for arid and semi arid regions of ethiopia planting was done using a spacing of 75 cm between rows and 15 cm between plants the planting depth was 5 cm and the planting density was about 9 plantsm 2 during this experiment planting was done after the onset of the rainy season once sufficient moisture is available in the soil to support germination however due to erratic rainfall distribution short and extended dry spells are common in most places a short dry spell even during the rainy season significantly affects yield and thus irrigation is critical agronomic practices included a split application of fertilizer that consists of 100 kgha 1 diammonium phosphate dap and 50 kgha 1 of urea at planting and 50 kgha 1 of urea thirty days after planting approximately at five leaf stage the necessary management data for model calibration and evaluations were recorded 2 3 crop model simulation the cropping system model csm ceres sorghum model jones et al 2003 white et al 2015 of the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat hoogenboom et al 2019 is one of the widely used crop simulation models in this study the ceres crop estimation through resource and environment synthesis sorghum model within the dssat 4 7 6 was used the csm ceres sorghum model simulates crop growth development and yield based on defined datasets of management weather soil parameters and genetic coefficients of specific cultivars the model also allows for the simulation of a dynamic plant and soil water nitrogen phosphorus carbon balance and the impact of best management practices on crop yield and yield components adam et al 2018 crop management practices such as cultivar type planting date fertilizer application time and rate plant density sowing depth etc were accurately represented during the model setup local farmers fertilizer and tillage practices were followed and the teshale cultivar was sown at a density of 9 plantsm 2 with 100 kg ha 1 dap and 50 kg ha 1 of urea during sowing and an additional 50 kg ha 1 urea 30 days after sowing were applied initial soil conditions for nodule and root weight were set at 10 kg ha 1 each with 50 of the residue incorporated in the top 3 cm of soil the model was calibrated and evaluated based on field experimental data before it was used to evaluate potential climate change impact on sorghum yield and evaluate the effectiveness of selected climate change adaptation practices for two sites selected in this study 2 4 weather and soil data daily minimum and maximum temperatures rainfall and radiation data for the two study sites were obtained from the national meteorology agency of ethiopia nma soil profile data for kobo and meisso sites were obtained from marc soil data have seven to eight different horizons with defined physical and chemical properties at each layer table 1 soils at both sites have slightly basic ph 7 6 7 8 with relatively low organic matter contents 0 9 1 5 a clay loam texture was dominant on the top 15 cm of soil at both sites table 1 2 5 climate change scenarios future climate change scenarios were created following the agricultural model intercomparison and improvement project agmip protocol which uses the delta statistics approach hudson and ruane 2015 future climate scenarios were produced for three future periods 2025s 2010 2039 2055s 2040 2069 and 2085s 2070 2099 based on agricultural model intercomparison and improvement project agmip protocol rosenzweig et al 2015 from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 and two representative concentration pathways rcps rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 five representative gcms were selected out of the 20 gcms that are available in the agmip climate scenario hudson and ruane 2015 scatter plots of mean temperature and rainfall changes during the crop growing season with reference to the baseline period were used to select five representative gcms for each site fig 3 the five gcms were chosen to represent the five quadrants in the scatter plot designated as cool wet cool dry middle hot wet and hot dry ruane and mcdermid 2017 tables 2 and 3 in addition based on the agmip regional climate assessment protocol co2 concentrations were set at 423 for 2025 499 for 2055 and 532 ppm for 2085 for rcp4 5 and 532 ppm and 432 571 and 801 ppm for rcp8 5 in 2025s 2055s and 2085s periods respectively rosenzweig et al 2017 2 6 model calibration and evaluation the model was calibrated using five years 2005 2007 and 2010 2011 and evaluated with three years 2011 2013 experimental data model calibration involved fine tuning model parameters related to soil properties climatic characteristics and plant growth parameters so that simulated values compared buddhaboon et al 2018 hunt et al 1993 reasonably well with observed data hoogenboom et al 2012 timsina and humphreys 2006 in addition to the species and eco type parameters seven genetic coefficients were used to define traits that differentiate cultivars within a crop species the genetic coefficient calculator gencalc was used to estimate the genotype specific coefficient for dssat crop model román paoli et al 2000 in gencalc the coefficients of a genotype are estimated iteratively by running the appropriate crop model anothai et al 2008 hunt et al 1993 jones et al 2011 genotype coefficients of the sorghum cultivar were estimated from a base cultivar coefficient that exists in the dssat database which resembles cultivar teshale with respect to maturity the iteration continues until the model simulation fits well with the observed data set anothai et al 2008 the genotype coefficients were determined in a specified sequence starting with those related to crop development followed by yield and yield components model performance evaluations were done during calibration and evaluation using the coefficient of determination

alleviating the negative impacts of climate change on moisture stress and sorghum yield were evaluated sorghum planting date in the historical baseline periods was started on the onset of the main rainfall seasons third week of june see fig 2 kassie et al 2013 has conducted survey about the farmers management practices in kobo and he indicated that the farmers usually started planting when the main rainy seasons started we have also analyzed the historical rainfall conditions of both locations and it depicted that the main rainy seasons was started in june particularly jun 21 for kobo and jun 18 for meisso fig 2 in this paper the baseline planting date was also determined to be june 21 for kobo and june 18 for meisso getachew et al 2016 kassie et al 2013 planting dates were selected by shifting the baseline plating dates by about 10 days forward and backward resulting in nine planting dates between early may to the end of july in addition deficit and full irrigation treatments were set based on daily root zone moisture balance deficit supplemental irrigation was set to trigger when percent available water content pawc reaches 25 and irrigation will be applied only up to 75 of pawc while the full irrigation refill point was 50 pawc and was set to refill 100 optimal irrigation refill points are mostly recommended at 50 pawc to avoid any moisture stress to the plant under limited moisture availability actual evapotranspiration eta will be reduced and smaller than the potential evapotranspiration etp the csm ceres sorghum model simulates drought stress as proportion of potential demand to the potential supply of water to the plant for photosynthesis and the phenomenon is expressed as the moisture stress index for photosynthesis wspd jones et al 2003 the value of wspd ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 is no stress and 1 is maximum stress 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the csm ceres sorghum model results showed that the model was able to simulate anthesis maturity and grain yield very well for both calibration and evaluation table 4 the model performed well in simulating days to anthesis r2 0 73 nrmse 2 98 days to maturity r2 0 59 nrmse 3 58 and grain yield r2 0 76 nrmse 5 11 during the calibration similarly the model performance well during evaluation of anthesis r2 0 86 nrmse 1 27 maturity r2 0 79 nrmse 2 69 and grain yield r2 0 99 nrmse 6 45 moreover d values were greater than 0 61 which indicate that good agreement between observed and simulated values according to jamieson et al 1991 nrmse values 10 show that the overall performance of the model was excellent calibrated and evaluated genetic coefficients are summarized in table 5 3 2 projected climate change projected climate change results showed that average temperature will increase for the three future periods 2025s 2055s and 2085s as simulated by the five gcms for the two rcps fig 4a average temperature is projected to consistently increase for all scenarios and periods for both locations and is expected to show a steady increase with the progression of the 21st century the projected increase in average temperature during the crop growing season was estimated to reach up to 6 c for rcp8 5 in the 2085s for both study sites fig 4a however the projections for precipitation were mixed with an increase and decrease for the two sites in most hot wet and cool wet climate conditions under all rcps and periods fig 4b the highest increases in total precipitation during the crop growing season were projected in 2085s and rcp 8 5 for hot wet climate conditions overall hot wet climate conditions showed consistent increases in precipitation for both locations but increases were higher for kobo than meisso fig 4b consistent increases in projected precipitation was observed under hot dry scenarios with the progression of the century the hot dry and cool dry scenarios showed modest reductions in precipitation while the cool wet and hot wet scenarios showed increases compared to the baseline period fig 4b our results were in agreement with previous studies from ethiopia where findings have constantly shown that temperature would considerably increase while mixed projections were reported for rainfall conway and schipper 2011 napa 2007 a study at kobo by kassie et al 2014 kassie 2014 reported that projected annual rainfall would vary from 40 to 10 compared to the baseline while the average annual temperature would increase by up to 4 1 c by the 2080s fig 4a kassie 2014 also indicated that seasonal rainfall for kobo will increase during november december while during the main sorghum growing season rainfall will decrease by 12 35 similarly a study in southern tigray reported that minimum and maximum temperatures would both increase by up to 6 c towards the end of this century hadgu et al 2015 arndt et al 2011 found that in the 2080s rainfall in ethiopia will decline by up to 20 during the main rainy season compared to the 1960 1990 period 3 3 sorghum yield projection yield projections for rainfed production systems showed a considerable decrease for all climate change scenarios except for a few projected increases for the hot wet cool wet and cool dry climate scenarios for two periods fig 5 overall a larger reduction in yield was projected for meisso compared to the baseline period fig 5 among the climate scenarios considered the hot dry scenario is projected to result in the largest reduction in yield across all locations periods and rcps fig 5 these results are in agreement with findings from previous studies in the region multiple studies on crop production projected considerable yield reduction particularly in sub saharan africa including ethiopia akinseye et al 2020 kassie et al 2014 ipcc 2007 estimated that climate change would result in a 50 reduction in rainfed agricultural production in east africa by 2020 the report by ipcc showed that an increase of temperature by 1 2 c could likely have a negative impact on major cereal crops in lower latitude regions than higher latitude where the crops are already grown near their maximum temperature tolerance e g 35 c for sorghum the report suggested that agricultural productivity decreases due to less favorable weather conditions reduced water availability for irrigation increased heat stress and prolonged droughts waithaka et al 2013 also stated that temperature increase would lead to an increase in evapotranspiration and thereby an increase in drought stress causing a reduction in yield their work showed that rainfed sorghum yield would decrease over a very large area in the western and northwestern parts of ethiopia with up to a 5 25 reduction in sorghum yield for the western parts of tigray and amhara region of ethiopia this reduction in yield in addition to an already sub optimal farm productivity could have a significant impact on the food security and the fragile economy 3 4 effect of planting date on crop moisture stress for the rainfed production system severe moisture stress 0 75 1 0 was prevalent during most of the sorghum growth period starting at emergence to anthesis for both sites fig 6 however anthesis was the most affected stage by moisture stress across all rcps and periods up to 80 days of severe moisture stress 0 75 1 0 per crop season were observed for kobo fig 6a while for meisso it could reach as high as 125 days per season fig 6b moisture stress was relatively small during germination end of panicle growth and maturity one notable observation was that moisture stress tends to decrease under rcp8 5 compared to rcp4 5 in 2055s and 2085s this could be due to an increase projected rainfall and co2 concentration the increase in co2 concentration could potentially result in reduced moisture stress due to a reduction in transpiration rates studies have shown that elevated co2 concentration reduces moisture stress leakey 2009 overall the effect of planting date on moisture stress showed mixed results both early and late planting dates showed both an increase and decrease in moisture stress similarly there was no difference between climate scenarios in moisture stress mastrorilli et al 1995 reported that moisture stress during the sorghum flowering stage had the most significant effect on yield therefore the stress that occurs around the flowering stages could be used as an indicator of yield reduction however it should be also noted that moisture stress during other sorghum physiological developmental stages can also have a negative effect on sorghum yield kothari et al 2020 other studies have reported that rainfed sorghum production would be negatively impacted by climate change due to high moisture stress in these areas kassie et al 2014 argued that rainfall and temperature projections in northern ethiopia could be an indication that climate change could have a significant effect on rainfed sorghum production they also reported that a decrease in rainfall during sorghum growth season coupled with a warming temperature trend will further exacerbate moisture stress however as discussed previously early planting dates had a positive impact on sorghum yield for both locations especially when combined with supplemental irrigation which suggests its potential use as climate change adaptation practice shifting planting date has been tested as climate change adaptation practices for different crops such as rice dharmarathna et al 2014 sorghum akinseye et al 2020 wheat nouri et al 2017 maize ahmad et al 2020 and other crops 3 5 effect of supplemental irrigation on crop moisture stress as expected supplemental irrigation to the current rainfed production system resulted in considerable reductions in moisture stress for the two study sites fig 7 reduction in moisture stress from supplemental irrigation was proportional to irrigation level with full irrigation resulting in complete moisture stress free days throughout the crop growing season deficit irrigation also resulted in a reduction of moisture stress by up to 50 days per season and most importantly the stress days were sparsely distributed across the crop growth period alleviating the stress during anthesis which was the most affected growth stage fig 7 the effectiveness of deficit irrigation in reducing moisture stress was slightly higher in meisso fig 7b than kobo fig 7a reductions in moisture stress frequencies and severities from the deficit and full supplemental irrigation to the current rainfed production systems for both locations would result in an increase in sorghum yield on average deficit and full irrigation for kobo resulted in 16 and 22 irrigation events which were equivalent to 231 and 348 mm of total irrigation during the crop growth season respectively similarly for meisso deficit and full irrigation on average required 346 and 491 mm which were applied over 18 and 21 irrigation events respectively table 6 3 6 effect of supplemental irrigation and planting date on sorghum yield the reduction in the frequency of moisture stress and severity due to implementation of deficit and full supplemental irrigation practices to the current rainfed production systems were also reflected by projected increase in sorghum yield for both sites figs 8 and 9 the increase was sufficiently high to offset the projected reduction in yield of up 2 tha 1 and resulted in a net yield increase for all climate change scenarios and periods figs 8 and 9 full irrigation was effective in reducing moisture stress and thereby increasing sorghum yield by up to 3 tha 1 for kobo and 2 tha 1 for meisso on average the yield difference between deficit and full irrigation was about 1 tha 1 our findings were in agreement with several studies that showed the effectiveness of irrigation as climate change adaptation practice finger et al 2011 kassie et al 2015 muluneh et al 2017 for the rainfed production system sorghum yield percentage change was estimated to be 4 7 3 in the 2025s 2055s 2085s respectively at kobo under rcp4 5 meanwhile it would be 28 18 30 in the 2025s 2055s 2085s respectively at meisso under rcp4 5 compared to the baseline as we applied deficit irrigation the sorghum production would projected to increase by 50 36 33 in the 2025s 2055s 2085s respectively at kobo under rcp4 5 while it would increase 39 33 24 in the 2025s 2055s 2085s respectively at meisso under rcp4 5 compared to the baseline the sorghum production even goes higher as we applied full irrigation in both locations among the five climate conditions cool wet and cool dry conditions resulted in higher yield while hot dry conditions resulted in the lowest yield even with supplemental irrigation between the two locations the yield was higher and more variable for kobo than for meisso similarly yield differences among climate scenarios were higher in kobo than meisso fig 8 overall the average yield for the two locations was consistently higher under rcp4 5 than rcp8 5 figs 8 and 9 this could be due to increased co2 concentration which favors high biomass production that may not necessarily lead to an increase in grain yield ottman et al 2001 reported that elevation of co2 concentration increases sorghum biomass production in drier areas ottman et al 2001 increases in co2 concentration have shown both positive and negative effects on sorghum kothari et al 2020 for example results from the free air co2 enrichment face experiments at maricopa arizona ottman et al 2001 and open top field chamber studies at auburn alabama prior et al 2003 reported both increases and reductions of grain sorghum yield from elevation of co2 concentrations early planting dates tend to increase crop yield compared to the baseline planting dates june 21 for kobo and june 18 for meisso and late planting dates under rainfed or with supplemental irrigation production systems figs 8 and 9 however the effects of early planting were higher when implemented with irrigation than under rainfed similar studies have also reported that early planting dates were beneficial in increasing early maturing sorghum cultivars akinseye et al 2020 it is also worth noting that results varied between the five climate scenarios where cool wet and hot wet scenarios resulting in higher yield increases affordability of adaptation practices is equally important as their effectiveness for wider implementation by smallholder farmers these findings would have significant practical implications as farmers could easily implement such adaptation practices for climate change in northern ethiopia a study by gebrekiros et al 2016 estimated that under current panting dates future sorghum yield would decrease between 5 and 24 compared to the baseline period gebrekiros et al 2016 4 conclusion our results showed that average temperature will increase by up to 6 c for both study sites meanwhile rainfall projections showed mixed results where reductions and increases were estimated compared to the baseline period for both locations under the current rainfed production system crop moisture stress is also projected to intensify especially during crop anthesis which in turn negatively affects sorghum yield overall the sorghum yield under the rainfed production system was very low 6 2 t ha 1 average yield projections also show reductions for both sites which highlights the need for climate change adaptation practices that could help increase sorghum yield these identified impacts of climate change on moisture stress status by crop growth stages will allow farmers to apply a targeted irrigation and still possibly achieve optimal yield irrespective of the projected climate moreover it will also provide critical information to breeders to develop improved cultivars that can adapt the impacts of climate change results from this study show that irrigation could play a significant role in tackling moisture stress frequency and severity and thereby increase sorghum yield the yield increase was positively correlated with increases in supplemental irrigation from rainfed to the deficit and full irrigation full irrigation was effective in increasing sorghum yield by up to 3 tha 1 for kobo and 2 tha 1 for meisso on average yield difference between deficit and full irrigation was about 1 tha 1 similarly early planting dates tend to increase crop yield especially when implemented with supplemental irrigation overall results from this study would help to inform policy and management decisions towards climate change adaptation efforts as such these findings would have significant practical implications as smallholder farmers need adaptation practices that could be implemented easily with small or no capital investment in this regard shifting planting dates should be investigated further as potential climate change adaptation practices not only for sorghum but also for other staple crops in addition future studies should investigate irrigation water availability for supplemental irrigation cost benefit analysis the feasibility of small scale irrigation schemes that can be implemented at smallholder farm levels

9992,crude protein cp and fiber are the two most important quality traits of forage crops and accurately estimating them under water and salt stress is of great significance to the production of high quality alfalfa however there is seldom an applicable quality model here we conducted pot and plot experiments under three irrigation amounts full irrigation w1 moderate water deficit w2 and severe water deficit w3 and six soil salinity levels s0 s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 indicating 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 mass ratio of salt per unit soil mass respectively to examine the responses of cp and relative feed value rfv and develop cp and rfv models in alfalfa at different growth ages under combined water and salt stress we found that there was a negative parabolic relationship between relative alfalfa cp cp r and relative soil electrical conductivity ec r with a ec r threshold ec rth for maximum cp r moderate water stress improved the cp r while cutting number related to growth age had the opposite effect the ec rth tended to decrease with increasing water stress and growth age i e they increased the sensitivity of cp r to salt stress relative rfv rfv r of alfalfa was improved by water and salt stress however at the expense of biomass reduction and the rate of increase declined with increasing growth age based on the above crude protein and fiber models of alfalfa incorporating growth age under water and salt stress were developed and performed well under pot cp model r 2 0 94 rfv model r 2 0 98 and plot conditions cp model r 2 0 95 rfv model r 2 0 88 overall the developed cp and rfv models would provide an essential framework for the production of high quality forage in saline soil conservation of water resources and suppression of salinization keywords soil electrical conductivity crude protein relative feed value growth age quality model 1 introduction water and salinity are two of the key abiotic factors that affect crop yield and quality al dakheel et al 2015 alfalfa as a perennial forage crop with good quality high water saving potential and moderate salinity sensitivity allen et al 1998 is widely cultivated in arid and semiarid regions djilianov et al 2003 however these regions are facing two major environmental problems water shortage and soil salinization chamekh et al 2016 masters et al 2007 accurate estimation and scientific management of alfalfa under combined water and salt stress are of great significance to high quality forage production water conservation and salt suppression in saline soil carmi et al 2006 jahanzad et al 2013 crude protein cp and fiber are two vital quality traits of alfalfa with cp representing the nutritional value and fiber representing the palatability and total digestible nutrients al dakheel et al 2015 jahanzad et al 2013 thivierge et al 2016 the effects of water and salt stress on the protein or nitrogen in plants vary based on the environment and cultivar and can be considered from two aspects nitrogen absorption and photosynthate accumulation wang and baerenklau 2014 water deficit reduces the availability of nitrogen by affecting nitrogen fixation and declining transpiration as a carrier of mineral nitrogen from the soil to plants durand et al 2009 gonzalez dugo et al 2010 on the other hand water stress affects the growth of plants and reduces biomass accumulation and nitrogen uptake kunrath et al 2018 ran et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 studies have shown that although nitrogen uptake is improved by increasing irrigation amount cp concentration per unit dry mass is reduced by dilution i e water deficit improves the cp of alfalfa cavero et al 2017 donovan and meek 1983 soil salinity can further enhance the stress through osmotic stress and ion toxicity isla and aragüés 2009a 2009b hedayati firoozabadi et al 2020 found that the cp of feed sorghum decreases linearly with increasing irrigation water salinity and the degree of decline varies with cultivars water and salt stress can reduce fiber in plants and thus improve in vitro dry matter digestibility and total digestible nutrients of alfalfa halim et al 1989 jahanzad et al 2013 on the one hand water and salt stress reduce photoassimilates molero et al 2019 radanielson et al 2018 wang and baerenklau 2014 thus directly leading to a decrease in neutral detergent fiber ndf and acid detergent fiber adf and an increase in relative feed value rfv robinson et al 2004 on the other hand plants accumulated soluble carbohydrates ben ghedalia et al 2001 and other osmotic regulatory substances when exposed to stress thereby indirectly affecting the synthesis of fiber ben ghedalia et al 2001 jahanzad et al 2013 liu et al 2016 the activity of fiber synthase is also inhibited under stress fariaszewska et al 2017 all the above factors affect the formation of the cell wall and growth of plants and finally lead to an increase in rfv hedayati firoozabadi et al 2020 found that the ndf and adf of forage sorghum improved with increasing irrigation water salinity while suyama et al 2007 showed the opposite with ndf presenting a decreasing trend robinson et al 2004 found that compared to the lower irrigation water salinity treatment 15 ds m 1 a significant reduction in the yield but improvement in the quality of alfalfa was observed under the higher salinity treatment 25 ds m 1 including increased cp decreased ndf and improved in vitro dry matter digestibility and metabolic energy me overall the effects of water and salt stress on crop quality vary due to the crop variety severity duration salt type growth age and environment which need to be further studied many studies have shown that growth age is one of the important factors affecting crop quality paredes et al 2017 robinson et al 2004 stefanon et al 1996 cutting causes mechanical injuries to forage which may cause water imbalance in the plant guo et al 2018 damage to the main root berg et al 2018 and metabolic disorders of c and n at different organ levels aranjuelo et al 2015 molero et al 2019 cutting could change the growth process and age of alfalfa resulting in varied quality among cuttings however previous studies on the response of alfalfa quality to water and salt stress among cuttings are inconsistent stefanon et al 1996 found that when irrigated with saline water the cp and fiber both decreased with increasing cutting times which was consistent with cao et al 2012 but inconsistent with suyama et al 2007 in addition to the intrinsic growth traits the accumulation of salt in perennial organs crown taproots and lateral roots also has a long term effect on the growth and quality of alfalfa cao et al 2012 leading to enhanced sensitivity to salt stress schiattone et al 2017 tripler et al 2011 díaz et al 2018 found that the responses of ndf adf cp rfv ash and me of alfalfa showed similar responses to water salinity among 15 cuttings which were related to the stress severity growth age and cultivars current studies on alfalfa mainly focus on biomass but few studies have focused on quantitative hay quality models under water and salt stress dynamic growth age cannot be ignored when simulating the response of alfalfa growth and quality to water and salt stress and it is different from annual crops but has seldom been taken into account by models thus we conducted both pot and plot experiments with different irrigation amount and soil salinity levels over three years aiming to 1 analyze the responses of cp ndf adf and rfv of potted alfalfa to soil water and salinity stress and their variations among different growth ages 2 establish a crude protein and fiber model to quantify the responses of cp and rfv of alfalfa at different growth ages to water and salt stress and 3 evaluate model performance under pot and plot conditions for different water and salt stress to our knowledge this is the first study to develop a crude protein and fiber model of alfalfa incorporating growth age under water and salt stress providing essential framework for the production of high quality forage in saline soil conservation of water resources and suppression of salinization 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions the experiments were conducted at the shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university 102 52 e 37 52 n elevation 1581 m from 2017 to 2019 the experimental site belongs to a typical arid desert inland with a mean annual solar radiation of over 3000 h a mean annual temperature of 8 c and average annual precipitation of 164 mm pot and plot experiments were carried out in the field and alfalfa medicago sativa l cv golden empress was planted in shallow pits on the soil surface with a planting density of 4 4 and 30 0 kg ha 1 respectively and the density of pot grown alfalfa was set lower taking a similar planting interval and the limited growth space into account the pot has a top diameter of 23 cm a bottom diameter of 18 5 cm and a height of 21 5 cm with drainage holes and gauze at the bottom the surface soil in the field was collected air dried and sieved and each pot was filled with 7 5 kg soil 0 2 kg ceramsite and 0 1 kg coarse sand as the filter layers the pots were buried in the ground with their top edge parallel to the ground the field capacity θf and bulk density of the soil in pots were 0 25 m3 m 3 and 1 51 g cm 3 respectively each pot had four shallow pits and two plants remained in each pit when 3 4 true cotyledons appeared the plot experiment was carried out using non weighing lysimeters with an area of 6 66 m2 3 33 m 2 m and a depth of 3 m the plots were separated by concrete thus no lateral or bottom leakage occurred the basic physical properties of the soil were presented in table s1 alfalfa planted in pots and plots was irrigated by drip irrigation and alfalfa was also planted around the pots and lysimeters to prevent boundary effects more details can be found in hu et al 2020 2 2 experimental design cutting was conducted in the early flowering stage for higher yield and hay quality due to the salt leaching caused by winter irrigation when alfalfa began to regrow in the second and third years the salt content of the soil was measured and supplemented to the set level via saline irrigation i e all salt treatments were irrigated with given saline water whose component was described in the section 2 2 1 to make up the soil salinity to the set salt treatment levels 1 2 3 4 and 5 therefore the growth and quality data of the first cutting were not collected after august 29th 2018 because of the insufficient light and heat resources and the impending wintering period we did not collect data of the next cutting but performed cutting on september 20th before winter began table 1 cutting through grazing and harvest would change the growth status and metabolic process of alfalfa molero et al 2019 resulting in different growth and quality performances at different cuttings over many years cutting was a vital process that divides the growth and re growth periods and was used to define the growth age of alfalfa in our study table 1 i e alfalfa was zero years old at planting and increased by 1 m year after each cutting m is the total cutting time in that year thus we obtained the growth age of alfalfa through accumulation 2 2 1 pot experiment two batches of pot experiments were conducted from june 4th 2018 to september 20th 2019 pot experiment ⅰ and from april 27th 2017 to september 20th 2019 pot experiment ⅱ and the growth periods of all cuttings can be found in table 1 we set three irrigation amount levels namely full irrigation w1 ck moderate deficit irrigation w2 and severe deficit irrigation w3 and six soil salinity levels namely s0 s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 which indicated that 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 salt were added to the soil mass ratio respectively a total of 18 treatments were conducted each with 20 pots as replicates and all treatments were supplied with sufficient water to ensure survival at the seedling stage w1 was irrigated to 95 100 θf when the soil water content reached 65 70 θf and the irrigation amounts for w2 and w3 were 2 3 and 1 2 of that of w1 respectively the salt was prepared by mixing nacl mgso4 and caso4 at a mass ratio of 2 2 1 which is the chemical composition of local groundwater and it was then mixed with air dried soil and filled in the pots to further examine the applicability of the models a plot experiment was designed based on pot experiments 2 2 2 plot experiment the plot grown alfalfa was planted on may 5th 2017 and the experiment was carried out from june 6th 2018 to september 20th 2019 i e the second and third growth years of alfalfa and the growth periods of all cuttings can be found in table 1 here we set two irrigation amounts namely full irrigation w1 ck and severe deficit irrigation w3 and four soil salinity levels namely s0 s2 s4 and s6 indicating that 0 2 4 and 6 salt was added to the soil mass ratio respectively eight treatments in 2018 and four selected treatments with two replicates w1s0 w3s2 w3s4 and w3s6 in 2019 were conducted the salt type was the same as that in the pot and salt was added to the 0 80 cm soil twice by saline irrigation on may 16th and may 23rd 2018 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 evapotranspiration the water balance method was used to estimate the actual evapotranspiration of alfalfa 1 e t a p i δ w r d where et a is the actual evapotranspiration mm p is the precipitation mm w is the variation in soil water storage mm r is the runoff mm and d is the drainage mm surface runoff and deep leakage were not observed in our study therefore r 0 and d 0 considering the frequent irrigation of pot grown alfalfa the variation in soil water storage was negligible compared with the irrigation amounts thus eq 1 can be simplified in pot experiments as follows 2 e t a p i 2 3 2 soil electrical conductivity the soil electrical conductivity ec in pots and plots was measured soil samples were collected before and after each cutting and an additional 1 3 times during the growth period the soil samples were collected using a 12 mm diameter auger from the soil surface to the bottom in the pots and a 26 mm diameter auger at depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm in the plots additional soil samples were collected on the day before and after irrigation soil with the same texture was quickly backfilled once the samples were collected the samples were air dried ground and passed through a 1 mm sieve to prepare soil leachate at a soil to water ratio of 1 5 the soil electrical conductivity ec 1 5 ds m 1 was measured with an electrical conductivity meter s230 mettler toledo international inc switzerland 2 3 3 biomass alfalfa was sampled at harvest with the stems and leaves separated and placed in an oven for 8 h at 105 and dried at 85 for 2 3 d until a constant weight was obtained electronic scales with an accuracy of 0 01 g were used for weighing the dried samples 2 3 4 crude protein neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber the dried alfalfa samples were smashed and passed through an 80 mesh sieve to test quality plant nitrogen was tested using an automatic nitrogen testing system kjeltec 8400 foss hilleroed dk based on the kjeldahl method aoac 2000 and ndf and adf were measured using a fiber analyzer ankom a200i ny usa based on the method of soest et al 1991 cp and rfv can be calculated as follows putnam et al 2008 3 c p n 6 25 4 r f v d m i d d m 1 29 5 d m i 120 n d f 6 d d m 88 9 0 779 a d f where n is the plant nitrogen 6 25 is the protein coefficient dmi dry matter intake bw is the random intake of forage dry matter measured as a percentage of the animal s body weight and ddm digestible dry matter dw is the digestible dry matter of forage measured as a percentage of the dry matter it is generally considered that the relative feed value of alfalfa in the blooming period is 100 therefore 1 29 is used as a correction factor 2 3 5 meteorological factors meteorological data were collected by an automatic weather station approximately 100 m away from the experimental site hobo onset computer corp usa including radiation wind speed humidity precipitation etc and they were automatically recorded every 15 min the daily reference crop evapotranspiration et0 was calculated by the penman monteith formula fig s1 allen et al 1998 3 model development and validation 3 1 model development 3 1 1 cp model the cp model that considers growth age under water and salt stress was established based on our experimental data relative cp cp r showed parabolic relationships with relative ec and three key parameters α 0 ec rth and cp v were to be decided because the cp r response curves varied among different water treatments and cuttings we defined the expression formulae of parameters to water stress and growth age after statistical analysis as follow 7 c p a c p c k α 0 e c a e c c k e c r t h 2 c p v 8 e c r t h α 1 a g e α 2 e t a e t c k α 3 9 c p v α 4 a g e α 5 e t a e t c k α 6 where cp a and cp ck are the crude protein of alfalfa under the actual and nonstress treatments respectively ec a and ec ck are the soil electrical conductivity under the actual and nonstress treatments respectively et a and et ck are evapotranspiration under the actual and nonstress treatments respectively and age is the growing age of alfalfa et 0 actual et ck and actual ec ck of each cutting were shown in fig s1 to demonstrate their variations in the different experiments and cuttings ec rth means the threshold value of ec r when cp r equaled to cp v indicating the ability of alfalfa to maintain plant nitrogen level against salt stress and cp v means the maximum cp r in one cutting according to the law of quadratic function α 0 indicates the rangeability of cp r within a certain range of ec r and represents the sensitivity of cp to ec in our model α 1 and α 4 indicate the sensitivity of ec rth and cp v to growth age and α 2 and α 5 indicate the sensitivity of ec rth and cp v to water deficit respectively the intrinsic ec rth and cp v under no stress were defined as α 2 α 3 and α 5 α 6 respectively parameters that need to be calibrated for cp model are α 0 α 1 α 2 α 3 α 4 α 5 and α 6 3 1 2 rfv model the rfv model that considers growth age under water and salt stress was established based on our experimental data relative rfv rfv r showed linear relationships with relative ec and two key parameters β 0 and rfv 0 were to be decided given the rfv r response curves varied among different water treatments and cuttings we defined the expression formulae of parameters to water stress and growth age after statistical analysis as follow 10 r f v a r f v c k β 0 e c a e c c k r f v 0 11 β 0 β 1 a g e β 2 12 r f v 0 β 3 e t a e t c k β 4 where rfv a and rfv ck are the relative feed values of alfalfa under the actual and nonstress treatments respectively β 0 indicate the sensitivity of rfv r to ec r and rfv 0 means the minimum rfv r in each cutting according to the law of linear function β 1 and β 2 indicate the sensitivity of β 0 to growth age and intrinsic increase rate of rfv r with increasing ec r when alfalfa was planted respectively β 3 and β 4 indicate the sensitivity of rfv 0 to water deficit and intrinsic rfv r under no stress respectively parameters that need to be calibrated for rfv model are β 1 β 2 β 3 and β 4 3 2 statistical analysis parameters in the cp and rfv model were empirical and varied depending on stress growth age and experimental conditions the differences among water treatments and cuttings were compared by evaluating the slopes and intercepts for the variations of the model parameters with age or relative et using the covariance analysis ancova test where null expectation h0 was that the slope of the regression or intercept would not deviate significantly among water treatments the ancova test was performed using an app compare linear fit parameters and datasets in the originpro 2018 originlab corporation northampton ma usa separate parameters were fit for water treatments or cuttings when either the regression slopes or intercepts were significantly different and joint parameters across all treatments or cuttings when both the slopes and intercepts were no different after the cp and rfv model formulas were defined we used the spss 21 0 spss inc chicago il usa to fit the empirical parameters with the nonlinear least squares fitting method other statistical analyses and regressions were performed using originpro 2018 and p 0 05 was set as the threshold for significance 3 3 evaluation of model performance the data of the pot experiments in 2018 and 2019 pot experiment ⅰ and randomly selected half data of the plot experiment were selected for model calibration under pot and plot experiment respectively and the data of the pot experiments from 2017 to 2019 pot experiment ⅱ and the rest half data of the plot experiments were used for validation the fit parameters were used to calculate the cp and rfv model which had a better performance with smaller differences between the simulated and validation values the determination coefficient r 2 regression coefficient b root mean square error rmse and consistency coefficient d ia were used to evaluate the simulation accuracy of the models r 2 b rmse and d ia

4 results and discussion 4 1 crude protein and fiber models that consider the growth age under water and salt stress 4 1 1 a crude protein model that considers the growth age under water and salt stress the relationships between cp a cp ck cp r with ec a ec ck ec r in 2018 and 2019 pot experiment ⅰ and from 2017 to 2019 pot experiment ⅱ were shown in figs 1 and s2 respectively negative parabolic relationships were observed between the cp r of alfalfa and ec r under different water stresses and cuttings cp r was improved when ec r had not reached the ec rth and then decreased as ec r further increased water stress improved cp r while cutting number had the opposite effect and the cp r decreasing with cuttings in terms of pot experiment ⅰ ec rth in the age of 0 33 was 3 26 0 61 ds m 1 and 2 63 0 49 ds m 1 for full w1 and deficit irrigation w3 however the values declined to 2 18 0 41 ds m 1 and 1 36 0 26 ds m 1 at the age of 2 0 respectively ec rth tended to decrease with increasing water stress and cutting times i e water stress and growth age enhanced the sensitivity of cp r to salt stress the value ranges of cp of the two pot experiments were 22 1 32 8 and 22 9 32 8 and both achieved the supreme standard putnam et al 2008 according to the relationship between measured cp r and ec r figs 1 and s2 the cp model was established eq 7 and three key parameters α 0 ec rth and cp v were to be decided given the cp r response curves varied among different water treatments and cuttings we examined the responses of these parameters to water stress and growth age and defined their forms fig 2 eqs 8 and 9 in fig 2a no pronounced relationship was found between α 0 and age for three water treatments by the ancova test so α 0 was fit as a constant ec rth indicates the threshold ec r for maximum cp r and there was no significant difference among the regression slopes between ec rth and age for three water treatments p 0 936 but pronounced difference among their intercepts p 0 005 fig 2b so separate parameters were fit for the relationship between ec rth and age and ec rth and et a et ck respectively eq 8 fig 2b and c cp v represented the maximum cp r of each cutting and the regression slopes between cp v and age had no significant differences for three water treatments p 0 980 but the intercepts were significantly different p 0 039 so separate parameters were fit for the relationship between cp v and age and cp v and et r respectively eq 9 fig 2d and e after the construction of cp model parameters were calibrated for pot and plot grown alfalfa table 2 biomass and yield declines have been considered as primary indicators when water and salt stress occur especially for crops with high sensitivity fariaszewska et al 2017 steppuhn et al 2005 and the cp of plants would also be affected by dilution it can be seen from fig s3 that the aboveground biomass of alfalfa decreased with the increasing water and salt stress a certain degree of water stress was beneficial to the improvement of cp ashraf 2014 salt stress not only further reduced the osmotic potential of the soil solution but also affected the nitrogen fixation of alfalfa and reduced the water and nitrogen use efficiency kunrath et al 2018 a metabolic disorder caused by severe salt stress would inhibit the growth of stems and leaves and finally affect the quality of alfalfa díaz et al 2018 found that the cp of alfalfa was improved by salt stress only at the first growth season 1 5 cuttings while it initially increased and then decreased as the salt stress intensified at the second 6 10 cuttings and third 11 15 cuttings growth seasons which was similar with our study the ec rth was the ec r value for maximum cp r with the increasing soil salinity indicating the ability of alfalfa to maintain plant nitrogen level under salt stress our study found that the ec rth tended to decrease with increasing water stress and growth age water stress reduced soil water availability and intensified the effect of salt stress and the metabolic process of nutrients such as nitrogen were more significantly affected aranjuelo et al 2015 molero et al 2019 cutting aggravated the metabolic disorder of c and n in different organs and with the growth of alfalfa the accumulation of salt in alfalfa caused continuous damage to the plants guo et al 2018 schiattone et al 2017 thus water stress and cutting times enhanced the sensitivity of cp r to salt stress 4 1 2 a fiber model that considers the growth age under water and salt stress the variations of ndf a ndf ck ndf r and adf a adf ck adf r in 2018 and 2019 pot experiment ⅰ and from 2017 to 2019 pot experiment ⅱ were shown in figs s4 7 respectively rfv a rfv ck rfv r with ec r in pot experiment ⅰ and ⅱ were shown in figs 3 and s8 respectively ndf r and adf r showed a linearly decreasing trend with increasing ec r under different cuttings and water stress while rfv r had the opposite trend rfv r improved with increasing water stress and the rate of increase with ec r showed no significant difference between the irrigation treatments but declined with increasing growth years figs 3 and s8 in other words both water and salt stress improved the rfv of alfalfa and the rate of increase in rfv r declined as aging since rfv represents the combination of ndf and adf the fiber model is established based on rfv according to the relationship between measured rfv r and ec r figs 3 and s8 a rfv model was established eq 10 and two critical parameters β 0 and rfv 0 were to be decided in terms of the rfv r response curves varied among water treatments and cuttings we examined the responses of these parameters to water stress and growth age and defined their forms fig 4 eqs 11 and 12 β 0 represented the rate of increase in rfv r with increasing ec r and the regression slopes and intercepts between β 0 and age both had no significant difference for three water treatments by the ancova test p 0 234 and 0 835 fig 4a so the relationship between β 0 and age for three water treatments was fit as eq 11 rfv 0 represented the rfv r value under no salt stress eq 10 and the regression slopes and intercepts between rfv 0 and et a et ck both had no significant difference among cuttings p 0 122 and 0 071 so the relationship between rfv 0 and et a et ck for three water treatments was fit as eq 12 after the construction of rfv model parameters were calibrated for pot and plot grown alfalfa table 2 notably the specific forms of the cp and rfv models may be different when the soil salt composition changes water and salt stress directly affect the photosynthesis of plants leading to a series of processes including osmotic stress growth restriction and assimilation decline ding et al 2015 munns 2002 nowak and caldwell 1984 the main ingredients of ndf include cellulose hemicellulose lignin and silicate which are similar to those of the plant cell wall fariaszewska et al 2017 and digestibility of forage mainly depends on that of the cell wall gu et al 2004 hence water and salt stress resulted in reductions in the ndf adf and yield but improvements in the total digestible nutrients these findings have been confirmed by studies using different varieties of alfalfa ben ghedalia et al 2001 robinson et al 2004 and were also associated with an increase in the leaf stem ratio ferreira et al 2015 in addition to the effects on growth physiological and metabolic processes of plants are also changed molero et al 2019 including increased nonstructural carbohydrates fariaszewska et al 2017 thomas and james 1999 improved proline content which leads to inhibited cell wall formation fariaszewska et al 2017 reduced fiber synthase activity sheaffer et al 1992 and increased rfv which were consistent with our study our study demonstrated that the β 0 declined as cutting numbers increasing díaz et al 2018 had similar results the adf and ndf of alfalfa decreased with increasing salt stress together with an increased rfv however the rate of increase declined as cutting times increased this may be related to the changed structure and environmental adaptation ben ghedalia et al 2001 fariaszewska et al 2017 alfalfa was exposed to soil water and salt stress during the whole growth period and the ratio of leaf to stem decreased as growth age increases indicating an increased proportion of stem which has higher fiber content compared to leaves díaz et al 2018 thus the rate of increase in rfv declined as the growth age increased 4 2 validation of the crude protein and fiber models in different conditions and their applications 4 2 1 validation of the cp model the relationships between plot grown alfalfa cp r with ec r and rfv r with ec r under two water treatments in 2018 were shown in figs s9 and s10 respectively responses of pot grown and plot grown alfalfa cp r to water and salt stress were similar namely cp r was improved by salt stress but decreased when ec r exceeded the ec rth moderate water stress improved cp r while cutting number had the opposite effect the ec rth tended to decrease with increasing water stress and growth age while cp v was improved by enhanced water stress figs 1 2 s2 and s9 however there was a systematic bias between pot and plot grown alfalfa cp r fig s9 cp r for plot grown alfalfa had a higher value and ec rth namely a higher cp tolerance and lower sensitivity to stress and this may depend on the well developed roots which had the higher capability of nutrient absorption under stress aranjuelo et al 2015 berg et al 2018 durand et al 2009 thus the parameters for plot grown alfalfa related to salt and water stress α 0 α 2 and α 5 and growth age α 1 and α 4 were maintained while the parameters related to intrinsic physiological traits α 3 and α 6 were refit table 2 the cp model was validated using the data of the pot experiments from 2017 to 2019 pot experiment ⅱ and plot experiments in 2018 and 2019 and the model performance in each year can be found in fig 5 and table 3 under pot conditions over three years r 2 for total and each year were 0 94 and 0 86 0 95 rmse for total and each year were 0 60 and 0 41 0 72 respectively under plot conditions over two years r 2 for total and each year were 0 95 and 0 93 0 96 rmse for total and each year were 0 50 and 0 38 0 55 respectively indicating a good performance of cp model under different growth ages and growth conditions 4 2 2 validation of the rfv model responses of pot grown and plot grown alfalfa rfv r to water and salt stress were consistent namely rfv r showed a linearly increasing trend with increasing ec r under different cuttings and water stress and was reduced by growth age and water supply figs 3 4 s8 and s10 expect for a slighter improved rate of increase in the third cutting of w3 fig s10b not statistically significant in terms of the high consistency between pot grown and plot grown alfalfa rfv r fig s10 parameters for rfv model were maintained in plot condition fig s10 table 2 the rfv model was validated using the data of pot experiments from 2017 to 2019 pot experiment ⅰⅰ and plot experiments in 2018 and 2019 and the model performance in each year can be found in fig 6 and table 3 under pot conditions over three years r 2 for total and each year were 0 98 and 0 85 0 94 rmse for total and each year were 14 98 and 8 82 20 20 respectively under plot conditions over two years r 2 for total and each year were 0 88 and 0 85 0 95 rmse for total and each year were 12 39 and 11 59 13 15 respectively indicating the good performance of rfv model under different growth ages and conditions 4 2 3 model applications according to the relationships between the two quality traits and water and salt stress figs s9 and s10 there existed certain ranges of water and salt stress where rfv r of alfalfa was improved rfv r 1 0 and cp r was maintained at a relatively high level cp r 0 8 compared to those of treatment under no stress cp r 1 0 and rfv r 1 0 in terms of water stress deficit irrigation with half amount of full irrigation was feasible for higher cp r and rfv r however in terms of salt stress there existed age specific maximum ec 1 5 ec max values beyond which cp r will drop below 0 8 and the values can be obtained based on our cp model simulated maximum cp r cp v and the actual ec values of ec rth and ec max of pot and plot grown alfalfa under full w1 and deficit irrigation treatments w3 were shown in fig 7 in terms of plot experiment ec max in the first year was 2 06 and 2 02 ds m 1 for full and deficit irrigation however the values decline to 1 77 and 1 72 ds m 1 in the fifth year respectively cp v of alfalfa decreased from 1 08 to 1 03 for full irrigation and from 1 11 to 1 06 under deficit irrigation compared to plot grown alfalfa pot grown alfalfa had a lower hay quality according to corresponding simulated results i e lower cp v ec rth and ec max fig 7 our study suggested that alfalfa traditionally considered moderate sensitive to salt stress quality varied depending on soil salinity irrigation amount cutting management and planting pattern notably the improvement of alfalfa quality by water and salt stress was accompanied by the cost of biomass reduction fig s3 in terms of commercial value e g crude protein yield a trade off between quality and yield should be taken into account for alfalfa production in the saline environment besides the form of quality models may change when salt type was different due to the varied ion toxicity and sensitivity of crops ashraf 2014 ferreira et al 2015 isla and aragüés 2009b our study suggested more types of saline soil and quality data for longer terms are needed to further improve the cp and rfv models 5 conclusions in this study we analyzed the responses of crude protein and fiber in alfalfa at different growth ages under combined water and salt stress and the findings were used to establish cp and rfv models which were further validated under pot and plot conditions our study revealed that there was a negative parabolic relationship between the cp r of alfalfa and the ec r moderate water stress improved the cp r while cutting number showed the opposite effect the ec rth tended to decrease with enhanced water stress and cuttings i e water stress and growth age enhanced the sensitivity of cp r to salt stress the rfv r of alfalfa was increased by water and salt stress however at the expense of biomass loss and the rate of increase declined with increasing growth age the two quality models were developed and performed well in simulating the cp r and rfv r of alfalfa at different growth ages under soil water and salt stress in both pot and plot conditions our study demonstrated that there was a close relationship between alfalfa quality and growth age and the improvement of quality by water and salt stress was accompanied by the cost of biomass reduction and the trade off should be taken into

9992,crude protein cp and fiber are the two most important quality traits of forage crops and accurately estimating them under water and salt stress is of great significance to the production of high quality alfalfa however there is seldom an applicable quality model here we conducted pot and plot experiments under three irrigation amounts full irrigation w1 moderate water deficit w2 and severe water deficit w3 and six soil salinity levels s0 s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 indicating 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 mass ratio of salt per unit soil mass respectively to examine the responses of cp and relative feed value rfv and develop cp and rfv models in alfalfa at different growth ages under combined water and salt stress we found that there was a negative parabolic relationship between relative alfalfa cp cp r and relative soil electrical conductivity ec r with a ec r threshold ec rth for maximum cp r moderate water stress improved the cp r while cutting number related to growth age had the opposite effect the ec rth tended to decrease with increasing water stress and growth age i e they increased the sensitivity of cp r to salt stress relative rfv rfv r of alfalfa was improved by water and salt stress however at the expense of biomass reduction and the rate of increase declined with increasing growth age based on the above crude protein and fiber models of alfalfa incorporating growth age under water and salt stress were developed and performed well under pot cp model r 2 0 94 rfv model r 2 0 98 and plot conditions cp model r 2 0 95 rfv model r 2 0 88 overall the developed cp and rfv models

these regions are facing two major environmental problems water shortage and soil salinization chamekh et al 2016 masters et al 2007 accurate estimation and scientific management of alfalfa under

and fiber are two vital quality traits of alfalfa with cp representing the nutritional value and fiber representing the palatability and total digestible nutrients al dakheel et al 2015 jahanzad et al 2013 thivierge et al 2016 the effects of water and salt stress on the protein or nitrogen in plants vary based on the environment and cultivar and can be considered from two aspects nitrogen absorption and photosynthate accumulation wang and baerenklau 2014 water deficit reduces the availability of nitrogen by affecting nitrogen fixation and declining transpiration as a carrier of mineral nitrogen from the soil to plants durand et al 2009 gonzalez dugo et al 2010 on the other hand water stress affects the growth of plants and reduces biomass accumulation and nitrogen uptake kunrath et al 2018 ran et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 studies have shown that although nitrogen uptake is improved by increasing irrigation amount cp concentration per unit dry mass is reduced by dilution i e water deficit improves the cp of alfalfa cavero et al 2017 donovan and meek 1983 soil salinity can further enhance the stress through osmotic stress and ion toxicity isla and aragüés 2009a 2009b hedayati firoozabadi et al 2020 found that the cp of feed sorghum decreases linearly with increasing irrigation water salinity and the degree of decline varies with cultivars water and salt stress can reduce fiber in plants and thus improve in vitro dry matter digestibility and total digestible nutrients of alfalfa halim et al 1989 jahanzad et al 2013 on the one hand water and salt stress reduce photoassimilates molero et al 2019 radanielson et al 2018 wang and baerenklau 2014 thus directly leading to a decrease in neutral detergent fiber ndf and acid detergent fiber adf and an increase in relative feed value rfv robinson et al 2004 on the other hand plants accumulated soluble carbohydrates ben ghedalia et al 2001 and other osmotic regulatory substances when exposed to stress thereby indirectly affecting the synthesis of fiber ben ghedalia et al 2001 jahanzad et al 2013 liu et al 2016 the activity of fiber synthase is also inhibited under stress fariaszewska et al 2017 all the above factors affect the formation of the cell wall and growth of plants and finally lead to an increase in rfv hedayati firoozabadi et al 2020 found that the ndf and adf of forage sorghum improved with increasing irrigation water salinity while suyama et al 2007 showed the opposite with ndf presenting a decreasing trend robinson et al 2004 found that compared to the lower irrigation water salinity treatment 15 ds m 1 a significant reduction in the yield but improvement in the quality of alfalfa was observed under the higher salinity treatment 25 ds m 1 including increased cp decreased ndf and improved in vitro dry matter digestibility and metabolic energy me overall the effects of water and salt stress on crop quality vary due to the crop variety severity duration salt type growth age and environment which need to be further studied many studies have shown that growth age is one of the important factors affecting crop quality paredes et al 2017 robinson et al 2004 stefanon et al 1996 cutting causes mechanical injuries to forage which may cause water imbalance in the plant guo et al 2018 damage to the main root berg et al 2018 and metabolic disorders of c and n at different organ levels aranjuelo et al 2015 molero et al 2019 cutting could change the growth process and age of alfalfa resulting in varied quality among cuttings however previous studies on the response of alfalfa quality to water and salt stress among cuttings are inconsistent stefanon et al 1996 found that when irrigated with saline water the cp and fiber both decreased with increasing cutting times which was consistent with cao et al 2012 but inconsistent with suyama et al 2007 in addition to the intrinsic growth traits the accumulation of salt in perennial organs crown taproots and lateral roots also has a long term effect on the growth and quality of alfalfa cao et al 2012 leading to enhanced sensitivity to salt stress schiattone et al 2017 tripler et al 2011 díaz et al 2018 found that the responses of ndf adf cp rfv ash and me of alfalfa showed similar responses to water salinity among 15 cuttings which were related to the stress severity growth age and cultivars current studies on alfalfa mainly focus on biomass but few studies have focused on quantitative hay quality models under water and salt stress dynamic growth age cannot be ignored when simulating the response of alfalfa growth and quality to water and salt stress and it is different from annual crops but has seldom been taken into account by models thus we conducted both pot and plot experiments with different irrigation amount and soil salinity levels over three years aiming to 1 analyze the responses of cp ndf adf and rfv of potted alfalfa to soil water and salinity stress and their variations among different growth ages 2 establish a crude protein and fiber model to quantify the responses of cp and rfv of alfalfa at different growth ages to water and salt stress and 3 evaluate model performance under pot and plot conditions for different water and salt stress to our knowledge this is the first study to develop a crude protein and fiber model of alfalfa incorporating growth age under water and salt stress providing essential framework for the production of high quality forage in saline soil conservation of water resources and suppression of salinization 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions the experiments were conducted at the shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university 102 52 e 37 52 n elevation 1581 m from 2017 to 2019 the experimental site belongs to a typical arid desert inland with a mean annual solar radiation of over 3000 h a mean annual temperature of 8 c and average annual precipitation of 164 mm pot and plot experiments were carried out in the field and alfalfa medicago sativa l cv golden empress was planted in shallow pits on the soil surface with a planting density of 4 4 and 30 0 kg ha 1 respectively and the density of pot grown alfalfa was set lower taking a similar planting interval and the limited growth space into account the pot has a top diameter of 23 cm a bottom diameter of 18 5 cm and a height of 21 5 cm with drainage holes and gauze at the bottom the surface soil in the field was collected air dried and sieved and each pot was filled with 7 5 kg soil 0 2 kg ceramsite and 0 1 kg coarse sand as the filter layers the pots were buried in the ground with their top edge parallel to the ground the field capacity θf and bulk density of the soil in pots were 0 25 m3 m 3 and 1 51 g cm 3 respectively each pot had four shallow pits and two plants remained in each pit when 3 4 true cotyledons appeared the plot experiment was carried out using non weighing lysimeters with an area of 6 66 m2 3 33 m 2 m and a depth of 3 m the plots were separated by concrete thus no lateral or bottom leakage occurred the basic physical properties of the soil were presented in table s1 alfalfa planted in pots and plots was irrigated by drip irrigation and alfalfa was also planted around the pots and lysimeters to prevent boundary effects more details can be found in hu et al 2020 2 2 experimental design cutting was conducted in the early flowering stage for higher yield and hay quality due to the salt leaching caused by winter irrigation when alfalfa began to regrow in the second and third years the salt content of the soil was measured and supplemented to the set level via saline irrigation i e all salt treatments were irrigated with given saline water whose component was described in the section 2 2 1 to make up the soil salinity to the set salt treatment levels 1 2 3 4 and 5 therefore the growth and quality data of the first cutting were not collected after august 29th 2018 because of the insufficient light and heat resources and the impending wintering period we did not collect data of the next cutting but performed cutting on september 20th before winter began table 1 cutting through grazing and harvest would change the growth status and metabolic process of alfalfa molero et al 2019 resulting in different growth and quality performances at different cuttings over many years cutting was a vital process that divides the growth and re growth periods and was used to define the growth age of alfalfa in our study table 1 i e alfalfa was zero years old at planting and increased by 1 m year after each cutting m is the total cutting time in that year thus we obtained the growth age of alfalfa through accumulation 2 2 1 pot experiment two batches of pot experiments were conducted from june 4th 2018 to september 20th 2019 pot experiment ⅰ and from april 27th 2017 to september 20th 2019 pot experiment ⅱ and the growth periods of all cuttings can be found in table 1 we set three irrigation amount levels namely full irrigation w1 ck moderate deficit irrigation w2 and severe deficit irrigation w3 and six soil salinity levels namely s0 s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 which indicated that 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 salt were added to the soil mass ratio respectively a total of 18 treatments were conducted each with 20 pots as replicates and all treatments were supplied with sufficient water to ensure survival at the seedling stage w1 was irrigated to 95 100 θf when the soil water content reached 65 70 θf and the irrigation amounts for w2 and w3 were 2 3 and 1 2 of that of w1 respectively the salt was prepared by mixing nacl mgso4 and caso4 at a mass ratio of 2 2 1 which is the chemical composition of local groundwater and it was then mixed with air dried soil and filled in the pots to further examine the applicability of the models a plot experiment was designed based on pot experiments 2 2 2 plot experiment the plot grown alfalfa was planted on may 5th 2017 and the experiment was carried out from june 6th 2018 to september 20th 2019 i e the second and third growth years of alfalfa and the growth periods of all cuttings can be found in table 1 here we set two irrigation amounts namely full irrigation w1 ck and severe deficit irrigation w3 and four soil salinity levels namely s0 s2 s4 and s6 indicating that 0 2 4 and 6 salt was added to the soil mass ratio respectively eight treatments in 2018 and four selected treatments with two replicates w1s0 w3s2 w3s4 and w3s6 in 2019 were conducted the salt type was the same as that in the pot and salt was added to the 0 80 cm soil twice by saline irrigation on may 16th and may 23rd 2018 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 evapotranspiration the water balance method was used to estimate the actual evapotranspiration of alfalfa 1 e t a p i δ w r d where et a is the actual evapotranspiration mm p is the precipitation mm w is the variation in soil water storage mm r is the runoff mm and d is the drainage mm surface runoff and deep leakage were not observed in our study therefore r 0 and d 0 considering the frequent irrigation of pot grown alfalfa the variation in soil water storage was negligible compared with the irrigation amounts thus eq 1 can be simplified in pot experiments as follows 2 e t a p i 2 3 2 soil electrical conductivity the soil electrical conductivity ec in pots and plots was measured soil samples were collected before and after each cutting and an additional 1 3 times during the growth period the soil samples were collected using a 12 mm diameter auger from the soil surface to the bottom in the pots and a 26 mm diameter auger at depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm in the plots additional soil samples were collected on the day before and after irrigation soil with the same texture was quickly backfilled once the samples were collected the samples were air dried ground and passed through a 1 mm sieve to prepare soil leachate at a soil to water ratio of 1 5 the soil electrical conductivity ec 1 5 ds m 1 was measured with an electrical conductivity meter s230 mettler toledo international inc switzerland 2 3 3 biomass alfalfa was sampled at harvest with the stems and leaves separated and placed in an oven for 8 h at 105 and dried at 85 for 2 3 d until a constant weight was obtained electronic scales with an accuracy of 0 01 g were used for weighing the dried samples 2 3 4 crude protein neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber the dried alfalfa samples were smashed and passed through an 80 mesh sieve to test quality plant nitrogen was tested using an automatic nitrogen testing system kjeltec 8400 foss hilleroed dk based on the kjeldahl method aoac 2000 and ndf and adf were measured using a fiber analyzer ankom a200i ny usa based on the method of soest et al 1991 cp and rfv can be calculated as follows putnam et al 2008 3 c p n 6 25 4 r f v d m i d d m 1 29 5 d m i 120 n d f 6 d d m 88 9 0 779 a d f where n is the plant nitrogen 6 25 is the protein coefficient dmi dry matter intake bw is the random intake of forage dry matter measured as a percentage of the animal s body weight and ddm digestible dry matter dw is the digestible dry matter of forage measured as a percentage of the dry matter it is generally considered that the relative feed value of alfalfa in the blooming period is 100 therefore 1 29 is used as a correction factor 2 3 5 meteorological factors meteorological data were collected by an automatic weather station approximately 100 m away from the experimental site hobo onset computer corp usa including radiation wind speed humidity precipitation etc and they were automatically recorded every 15 min the daily reference crop evapotranspiration et0 was calculated by the penman monteith formula fig s1 allen et al 1998 3 model development and validation 3 1 model development 3 1 1 cp model the cp model that considers growth age under water and salt stress was established based on our experimental data relative cp cp r showed parabolic relationships with relative ec and three key parameters α 0 ec rth and cp v were to be decided because the cp r response curves varied among different water treatments and cuttings we defined the expression formulae of parameters to water stress and growth age after statistical analysis as follow 7 c p a c p c k α 0 e c a e c c k e c r t h 2 c p v 8 e c r t h α 1 a g e α 2 e t a e t c k α 3 9 c p v α 4 a g e α 5 e t a e t c k α 6 where cp a and cp ck are the crude protein of alfalfa under the actual and nonstress treatments respectively ec a and ec ck are the soil electrical conductivity under the actual and nonstress treatments respectively et a and et ck are evapotranspiration under the actual and nonstress treatments respectively and age is the growing age of alfalfa et 0 actual et ck and actual ec ck of each cutting were shown in fig s1 to demonstrate their variations in the different experiments and cuttings ec rth means the threshold value of ec r when cp r equaled to cp v indicating the ability of alfalfa to maintain plant nitrogen level against salt stress and cp v means the maximum cp r in one cutting according to the law of quadratic function α 0 indicates the rangeability of cp r within a certain range of ec r and represents the sensitivity of cp to ec in our model α 1 and α 4 indicate the sensitivity of ec rth and cp v to growth age and α 2 and α 5 indicate the sensitivity of ec rth and cp v to water deficit respectively the intrinsic ec rth and cp v under no stress were defined as α 2 α 3 and α 5 α 6 respectively parameters that need to be calibrated for cp model are α 0 α 1 α 2 α 3 α 4 α 5 and α 6 3 1 2 rfv model the rfv model that considers growth age under water and salt stress was established based on our experimental data relative rfv rfv r showed linear relationships with relative ec and two key parameters β 0 and rfv 0 were to be decided given the rfv r response curves varied among different water treatments and cuttings we defined the expression formulae of parameters to water stress and growth age after statistical analysis as follow 10 r f v a r f v c k β 0 e c a e c c k r f v 0 11 β 0 β 1 a g e β 2 12 r f v 0 β 3 e t a e t c k β 4 where rfv a and rfv ck are the relative feed values of alfalfa under the actual and nonstress treatments respectively β 0 indicate the sensitivity of rfv r to ec r and rfv 0 means the minimum rfv r in each cutting according to the law of linear function β 1 and β 2 indicate the sensitivity of β 0 to growth age and intrinsic increase rate of rfv r with increasing ec r when alfalfa was planted respectively β 3 and β 4 indicate the sensitivity of rfv 0 to water deficit and intrinsic rfv r under no stress respectively parameters that need to be calibrated for rfv model are β 1 β 2 β 3 and β 4 3 2 statistical analysis parameters in the cp and rfv model were empirical and varied depending on stress growth age and experimental conditions the differences among water treatments and cuttings were compared by evaluating the slopes and intercepts for the variations of the model parameters with age or relative et using the covariance analysis ancova test where null expectation h0 was that the slope of the regression or intercept would not deviate significantly among water treatments the ancova test was performed using an app compare linear fit parameters and datasets in the originpro 2018 originlab corporation northampton ma usa separate parameters were fit for water treatments or cuttings when either the regression slopes or intercepts were significantly different and joint parameters across all treatments or cuttings when both the slopes and intercepts were no different after the cp and rfv model formulas were defined we used the spss 21 0 spss inc chicago il usa to fit the empirical parameters with the nonlinear least squares fitting method other statistical analyses and regressions were performed using originpro 2018 and p 0 05 was set as the threshold for significance 3 3 evaluation of model performance the data of the pot experiments in 2018 and 2019 pot experiment ⅰ and randomly selected half data of the plot experiment were selected for model calibration under pot and plot experiment respectively and the data of the pot experiments from 2017 to 2019 pot experiment ⅱ and the rest half data of the plot experiments were used for validation the fit parameters were used to calculate the cp and rfv model which had a better performance with smaller differences between the simulated and validation values the determination coefficient r 2 regression coefficient b root mean square error rmse and consistency coefficient d ia were used to evaluate the simulation accuracy of the models r 2 b rmse and d ia

4 results and discussion 4 1 crude protein and fiber models that consider the growth age under water and salt stress 4 1 1 a crude protein model that considers the growth age under water and salt stress the relationships between cp a cp ck cp r with ec a ec ck ec r in 2018 and 2019 pot experiment ⅰ and from 2017 to 2019 pot experiment ⅱ were shown in figs 1 and s2 respectively negative parabolic relationships were observed between the cp r of alfalfa and ec r under different water stresses and cuttings cp r was improved when ec r had not reached the ec rth and then decreased as ec r further increased water stress improved cp r while cutting number had the opposite effect and the cp r decreasing with cuttings in terms of pot experiment ⅰ ec rth in the age of 0 33 was 3 26 0 61 ds m 1 and 2 63 0 49 ds m 1 for full w1 and deficit irrigation w3 however the values declined to 2 18 0 41 ds m 1 and 1 36 0 26 ds m 1 at the age of 2 0 respectively ec rth tended to decrease with increasing water stress and cutting times i e water stress and growth age enhanced the sensitivity of cp r to salt stress the value ranges of cp of the two pot experiments were 22 1 32 8 and 22 9 32 8 and both achieved the supreme standard putnam et al 2008 according to the relationship between measured cp r and ec r figs 1 and s2 the cp model was established eq 7 and three key parameters α 0 ec rth and cp v were to be decided given the cp r response curves varied among different water treatments and cuttings we examined the responses of these parameters to water stress and growth age and defined their forms fig 2 eqs 8 and 9 in fig 2a no pronounced relationship was found between α 0 and age for three water treatments by the ancova test so α 0 was fit as a constant ec rth indicates the threshold ec r for maximum cp r and there was no significant difference among the regression slopes between ec rth and age for three water treatments p 0 936 but pronounced difference among their intercepts p 0 005 fig 2b so separate parameters were fit for the relationship between ec rth and age and ec rth and et a et ck respectively eq 8 fig 2b and c cp v represented the maximum cp r of each cutting and the regression slopes between cp v and age had no significant differences for three water treatments p 0 980 but the intercepts were significantly different p 0 039 so separate parameters were fit for the relationship between cp v and age and cp v and et r respectively eq 9 fig 2d and e after the construction of cp model parameters were calibrated for pot and plot grown alfalfa table 2 biomass and yield declines have been considered as primary indicators when water and salt stress occur especially for crops with high sensitivity fariaszewska et al 2017 steppuhn et al 2005 and the cp of plants would also be affected by dilution it can be seen from fig s3 that the aboveground biomass of alfalfa decreased with the increasing water and salt stress a certain degree of water stress was beneficial to the improvement of cp ashraf 2014 salt stress not only further reduced the osmotic potential of the soil solution but also affected the nitrogen fixation of alfalfa and reduced the water and nitrogen use efficiency kunrath et al 2018 a metabolic disorder caused by severe salt stress would inhibit the growth of stems and leaves and finally affect the quality of alfalfa díaz et al 2018 found that the cp of alfalfa was improved by salt stress only at the first growth season 1 5 cuttings while it initially increased and then decreased as the salt stress intensified at the second 6 10 cuttings and third 11 15 cuttings growth seasons which was similar with our study the ec rth was the ec r value for maximum cp r with the increasing soil salinity indicating the ability of alfalfa to maintain plant nitrogen level under salt stress our study found that the ec rth tended to decrease with increasing water stress and growth age water stress reduced soil water availability and intensified the effect of salt stress and the metabolic process of nutrients such as nitrogen were more significantly affected aranjuelo et al 2015 molero et al 2019 cutting aggravated the metabolic disorder of c and n in different organs and with the growth of alfalfa the accumulation of salt in alfalfa caused continuous damage to the plants guo et al 2018 schiattone et al 2017 thus water stress and cutting times enhanced the sensitivity of cp r to salt stress 4 1 2 a fiber model that considers the growth age under water and salt stress the variations of ndf a ndf ck ndf r and adf a adf ck adf r in 2018 and 2019 pot experiment ⅰ and from 2017 to 2019 pot experiment ⅱ were shown in figs s4 7 respectively rfv a rfv ck rfv r with ec r in pot experiment ⅰ and ⅱ were shown in figs 3 and s8 respectively ndf r and adf r showed a linearly decreasing trend with increasing ec r under different cuttings and water stress while rfv r had the opposite trend rfv r improved with increasing water stress and the rate of increase with ec r showed no significant difference between the irrigation treatments but declined with increasing growth years figs 3 and s8 in other words both water and salt stress improved the rfv of alfalfa and the rate of increase in rfv r declined as aging since rfv represents the combination of ndf and adf the fiber model is established based on rfv according to the relationship between measured rfv r and ec r figs 3 and s8 a rfv model was established eq 10 and two critical parameters β 0 and rfv 0 were to be decided in terms of the rfv r response curves varied among water treatments and cuttings we examined the responses of these parameters to water stress and growth age and defined their forms fig 4 eqs 11 and 12 β 0 represented the rate of increase in rfv r with increasing ec r and the regression slopes and intercepts between β 0 and age both had no significant difference for three water treatments by the ancova test p 0 234 and 0 835 fig 4a so the relationship between β 0 and age for three water treatments was fit as eq 11 rfv 0 represented the rfv r value under no salt stress eq 10 and the regression slopes and intercepts between rfv 0 and et a et ck both had no significant difference among cuttings p 0 122 and 0 071 so the relationship between rfv 0 and et a et ck for three water treatments was fit as eq 12 after the construction of rfv model parameters were calibrated for pot and plot grown alfalfa table 2 notably the specific forms of the cp and rfv models may be different when the soil salt composition changes water and salt stress directly affect the photosynthesis of plants leading to a series of processes including osmotic stress growth restriction and assimilation decline ding et al 2015 munns 2002 nowak and caldwell 1984 the main ingredients of ndf include cellulose hemicellulose lignin and silicate which are similar to those of the plant cell wall fariaszewska et al 2017 and digestibility of forage mainly depends on that of the cell wall gu et al 2004 hence water and salt stress resulted in reductions in the ndf adf and yield but improvements in the total digestible nutrients these findings have been confirmed by studies using different varieties of alfalfa ben ghedalia et al 2001 robinson et al 2004 and were also associated with an increase in the leaf stem ratio ferreira et al 2015 in addition to the effects on growth physiological and metabolic processes of plants are also changed molero et al 2019 including increased nonstructural carbohydrates fariaszewska et al 2017 thomas and james 1999 improved proline content which leads to inhibited cell wall formation fariaszewska et al 2017 reduced fiber synthase activity sheaffer et al 1992 and increased rfv which were consistent with our study our study demonstrated that the β 0 declined as cutting numbers increasing díaz et al 2018 had similar results the adf and ndf of alfalfa decreased with increasing salt stress together with an increased rfv however the rate of increase declined as cutting times increased this may be related to the changed structure and environmental adaptation ben ghedalia et al 2001 fariaszewska et al 2017 alfalfa was exposed to soil water and salt stress during the whole growth period and the ratio of leaf to stem decreased as growth age increases indicating an increased proportion of stem which has higher fiber content compared to leaves díaz et al 2018 thus the rate of increase in rfv declined as the growth age increased 4 2 validation of the crude protein and fiber models in different conditions and their applications 4 2 1 validation of the cp model the relationships between plot grown alfalfa cp r with ec r and rfv r with ec r under two water treatments in 2018 were shown in figs s9 and s10 respectively responses of pot grown and plot grown alfalfa cp r to water and salt stress were similar namely cp r was improved by salt stress but decreased when ec r exceeded the ec rth moderate water stress improved cp r while cutting number had the opposite effect the ec rth tended to decrease with increasing water stress and growth age while cp v was improved by enhanced water stress figs 1 2 s2 and s9 however there was a systematic bias between pot and plot grown alfalfa cp r fig s9 cp r for plot grown alfalfa had a higher value and ec rth namely a higher cp tolerance and lower sensitivity to stress and this may depend on the well developed roots which had the higher capability of nutrient absorption under stress aranjuelo et al 2015 berg et al 2018 durand et al 2009 thus the parameters for plot grown alfalfa related to salt and water stress α 0 α 2 and α 5 and growth age α 1 and α 4 were maintained while the parameters related to intrinsic physiological traits α 3 and α 6 were refit table 2 the cp model was validated using the data of the pot experiments from 2017 to 2019 pot experiment ⅱ and plot experiments in 2018 and 2019 and the model performance in each year can be found in fig 5 and table 3 under pot conditions over three years r 2 for total and each year were 0 94 and 0 86 0 95 rmse for total and each year were 0 60 and 0 41 0 72 respectively under plot conditions over two years r 2 for total and each year were 0 95 and 0 93 0 96 rmse for total and each year were 0 50 and 0 38 0 55 respectively indicating a good performance of cp model under different growth ages and growth conditions 4 2 2 validation of the rfv model responses of pot grown and plot grown alfalfa rfv r to water and salt stress were consistent namely rfv r showed a linearly increasing trend with increasing ec r under different cuttings and water stress and was reduced by growth age and water supply figs 3 4 s8 and s10 expect for a slighter improved rate of increase in the third cutting of w3 fig s10b not statistically significant in terms of the high consistency between pot grown and plot grown alfalfa rfv r fig s10 parameters for rfv model were maintained in plot condition fig s10 table 2 the rfv model was validated using the data of pot experiments from 2017 to 2019 pot experiment ⅰⅰ and plot experiments in 2018 and 2019 and the model performance in each year can be found in fig 6 and table 3 under pot conditions over three years r 2 for total and each year were 0 98 and 0 85 0 94 rmse for total and each year were 14 98 and 8 82 20 20 respectively under plot conditions over two years r 2 for total and each year were 0 88 and 0 85 0 95 rmse for total and each year were 12 39 and 11 59 13 15 respectively indicating the good performance of rfv model under different growth ages and conditions 4 2 3 model applications according to the relationships between the two quality traits and water and salt stress figs s9 and s10 there existed certain ranges of water and salt stress where rfv r of alfalfa was improved rfv r 1 0 and cp r was maintained at a relatively high level cp r 0 8 compared to those of treatment under no stress cp r 1 0 and rfv r 1 0 in terms of water stress deficit irrigation with half amount of full irrigation was feasible for higher cp r and rfv r however in terms of salt stress there existed age specific maximum ec 1 5 ec max values beyond which cp r will drop below 0 8 and the values can be obtained based on our cp model simulated maximum cp r cp v and the actual ec values of ec rth and ec max of pot and plot grown alfalfa under full w1 and deficit irrigation treatments w3 were shown in fig 7 in terms of plot experiment ec max in the first year was 2 06 and 2 02 ds m 1 for full and deficit irrigation however the values decline to 1 77 and 1 72 ds m 1 in the fifth year respectively cp v of alfalfa decreased from 1 08 to 1 03 for full irrigation and from 1 11 to 1 06 under deficit irrigation compared to plot grown alfalfa pot grown alfalfa had a lower hay quality according to corresponding simulated results i e lower cp v ec rth and ec max fig 7 our study suggested that alfalfa traditionally considered moderate sensitive to salt stress quality varied depending on soil salinity irrigation amount cutting management and planting pattern notably the improvement of alfalfa quality by water and salt stress was accompanied by the cost of biomass reduction fig s3 in terms of commercial value e g crude protein yield a trade off between quality and yield should be taken into account for alfalfa production in the saline environment besides the form of quality models may change when salt type was different due to the varied ion toxicity and sensitivity of crops ashraf 2014 ferreira et al 2015 isla and aragüés 2009b our study suggested more types of saline soil and quality data for longer terms are needed to further improve the cp and rfv models 5 conclusions in this study we analyzed the responses of crude protein and fiber in alfalfa at different growth ages under combined water and salt stress and the findings were used to establish cp and rfv models which were further validated under pot and plot conditions our study revealed that there was a negative parabolic relationship between the cp r of alfalfa and the ec r moderate water stress improved the cp r while cutting number showed the opposite effect the ec rth tended to decrease with enhanced water stress and cuttings i e water stress and growth age enhanced the sensitivity of cp r to salt stress the rfv r of alfalfa was increased by water and salt stress however at the expense of biomass loss and the rate of increase declined with increasing growth age the two quality models were developed and performed well in simulating the cp r and rfv r of alfalfa at different growth ages under soil water and salt stress in both pot and plot conditions our study demonstrated that there was a close relationship between alfalfa quality and growth age and the improvement of quality by water and salt stress was accompanied by the cost of biomass reduction and the trade off should be taken into

9993,understanding the response of spike density sd grain number per spike gn and thousand kernel weight tkw to the application amount of nitrogen and irrigation and clarifying the contribution of nitrogen and irrigation to the increased yield are vital for achieving high grain yield gy water and nitrogen use efficiency wue and nue in precision agriculture a two year 2018 2020 drip fertigated winter wheat experiment was conducted with three irrigation levels rain fed rf deficit irrigation di 75 etc and full irrigation fi 100 etc as main plot and four nitrogen levels 0 nn 85 n3 170 n2 and 255 n1 kg n hm 2 as subplot in northwest china the results showed that the tillers per plant tp significantly increased with increasing nitrogen application amount 0 255 kg hm 2 but the sd had insignificant difference between n1 and n2 levels due to lower effective spike rate esr of n1 the gn firstly increased and then decreased with increasing nitrogen application amount however the tkw continued to decrease with increasing nitrogen application amount irrigation significantly increased sd and gn but the impact on tkw showed uncertainty during two growing seasons the structure equation model showed that both irrigation and nitrogen indirectly affect gy by affecting yield components and nitrogen had the stronger influence to sd gn and tkw than irrigation in this study the highest gy 9 10 and 9 28 t hm 2 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively was observed at din2 which increased by 200 and 277 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons compared with rfnn treatment respectively and among these increased yield more than 65 and approximately 20 were contributed by the application of nitrogen and irrigation respectively in addition din2 also obtained the highest wue and higher nue due to lower actual evapotranspiration and nitrogen application amount therefore deficit drip irrigation 75 etc coupled with 170 kg n hm 2 was the best management strategy of irrigation and nitrogen under drip fertigation in northwest china keywords spike density grain number thousand kernel weight tiller density structure equation model 1 introduction water security is the foundation of food security and the shortage of water resource has led to a food crisis kang et al 2017 the global population will reach 9 5 billion by 2050 which indicated that the food production from agricultural system must be increased in the future alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 holman et al 2016 spiertz 2013 china as a populous country feeds about 20 of the global population by using about 6 of the global water resources and about 9 of the global arable land unfortunately agricultural water crisis was further aggravated by the increasing water demand of industry and urban life due to the rapid development of society in addition climate change has changed the distribution of precipitation in time and space which resulted in large fluctuations of irrigation water demand in annual and growth stage especially in northwest china xu et al 2020 zheng et al 2019 piao et al 2010 therefore the food security is under tremendous pressure in china agricultural water must be rationally planned and food production must be ensured by improving water use efficiency in china wheat one of the major food crops is widely cultivated over 23 7 million hectares accounting for 20 4 of the total crop planting areas and 24 3 of the total grain crop productions in 2019 in china china statistical yearbook 2020 and the yield gap between potential yield and average farmer s yield was 3 4 t hm 2 liu et al 2016 previous studies have reported that the grain yield gy was directly determined by grain number per spike gn spike density per unit area sd and grain weight li et al 2019 duggan et al 2000 and these yield components can be regulated by irrigation fertilization and other agronomic measures for example liu et al 2021 reported that high planting density and nitrogen application significantly increased sd of wheat but reduced gn and thousand kernel weight tkw li et al 2019 reported that increasing irrigation times could increase 4 6 22 2 of gy by reason of a significant increase in the tkw under micro sprinkling condition water stress occurred in the early season always led to tiller the foundation of sd death of cereal plants resulting in potential yield losses duggan et al 2000 and water stress around anthesis of winter wheat may result in a loss in gy by reducing sd spikelet number and fertility of surviving spikelet while water stress occurred in grain filling stage will reduce grain weight royo et al 2000 giunta et al 1993 it can be seen that the influence of water and nitrogen on wheat yield is mainly through the influence of yield components therefore clarifying the relationship between yield components and application amount of water and nitrogen is particularly important in addition the mutual constraints also existed among yield components for example excessive sd inhibits grain filling and reduces grain weight liu et al 2021 the competitive relationship of sd and gn may be existed from emergence to anthesis yang et al 2018a the gn had strong negative relationships with tkw fischer 2007 therefore balancing yield components and understanding the compensation of yield components are effective way to achieve high crop yield grafius 1978 however previous research mainly focused on the relationship between gy and application amount of irrigation and nitrogen of winter wheat the relationship between yield components of winter wheat and application amount of irrigation and nitrogen under drip fertigation was not clear especially in semi humid and drought prone regions the guanzhong plain is one of the most vital wheat production regions in northwest china and the annual production of wheat account for approximately 40 of the total gy in shaanxi province however the precipitation season from july to september does not synchronized with the winter wheat growing season from october through the following june previous research has reported that the water demand of high yield wheat is about 450 mm chen et al 2006 but only about 200 mm less than 40 of annual precipitation precipitation falls in the wheat growing season which greatly increased the dependence of winter wheat on irrigation seasonal drought stress often leads to low and unstable wheat yields in this region prevailing irrigation strategies flood or border irrigation are heavily dependent on field experiments and practical experience although previous research has given irrigation suggestions for winter wheat in different hydrological year xu et al 2020 it is unrealistic to guide crop irrigation by considering hydrological type and precipitation distribution in growth stage in addition growers in this region usually prefer to apply all of nitrogen n fertilizer at one time before sowing winter wheat which means that the winter wheat often suffered from the shortage of n during the late growth stages to achieve higher gy farmers usually applied excessive water flood or border irrigation and n surface broadcast to the field of winter wheat zhang et al 2015 ruidisch et al 2013 which have resulted in lower water nitrogen use efficiency and environmental pollution gu et al 2013 nayak et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 thus it is necessary to introduce advanced irrigation and fertilization methods and optimize water and nitrogen application amount for improving gy and water nitrogen use efficiency of winter wheat in this region drip fertigation one of the most advanced irrigation and fertilization management technologies could accurately transport nutrients and water to the plant roots accelerating the absorption of nutrients and water by crops li et al 2018 jha et al 2017 and improving crop yield and water fertilizer use efficiency by maximizing the coupling effect of water and fertilizer yan et al 2021 zou et al 2020 wang et al 2018 in addition previous researchers have reported that drip fertigation can minimize the nutrient leaching by split fertilizer according to the requirement of crops to fertilizer lu et al 2021 gardenas et al 2005 mitigate greenhouse gas emission and improve water fertilizer use efficiency compared with traditional irrigation wang et al 2016 tian et al 2017 therefore the optimal application amount of water and nitrogen under drip fertigation may differ with traditional water and nitrogen management although previous researchers have made a lot of research on the response of crop gy and water fertilizer use efficiency to different irrigation and n supply under drip fertigation these studies mainly focused on economic chen et al 2020 wang et al 2018 and staple crops of arid and semi arid areas yan et al 2021 zou et al 2020 fanish et al 2011 although yan and et al 2019 2020 carried out an experiment in guanzhong plain with different irrigation and fertilizer application amount under mobile rain proof shelter and concluded that mild water deficit coupled with appropriate fertilizer increased the grain weight they mainly focused on 1 the dynamics of grain filling and grain weight and 2 the accumulation of n p and k ignoring 1 the relationship between yield components and application amount of irrigation and nitrogen and 2 the contribution of nitrogen and irrigation to yield increase under different management strategies in summary the objectives of our research were to 1 investigate the response of wheat yield components to irrigation and nitrogen amount 2 clarify the contribution of irrigation nitrogen and their interaction to the increase of wheat yield under drip fertigation and 3 obtain the optimal combination of irrigation and nitrogen application amount for achieving high gy and wue under drip fertigation in northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the winter wheat field experiment was carried out from october 2018 to june 2020 at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering 34 17 n 108 4 e 506 m shaanxi province of northwest china this region belongs to semi humid and drought prone region in china

in guanzhong plain was manually planted row spacing 20 cm seeding rate 187 5 kg hm 2 on october 10 2018 and october 12 2019 and harvested on june 4 2019 and 2020 respectively in the experiment three irrigation levels rain fed rf deficit irrigation di 0 75 etc and full irrigation fi 1 0 etc as the main plot and four nitrogen levels 0 nn 85 n3 170 n2 and 255 n1 kg hm 2 as the subplot were arranged with three replicates for each treatment etc is the crop evapotranspiration mm d 1 calculated as etc kc et0 et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration calculated according to the references of allen et al 1998 and yan et al 2020 daily et0 was presented in the fig 1 kc is the crop coefficient which was set as 0 4 from the emergence to jointing 1 1 from the jointing to milk stage and 0 4 from the milk stage to harvest time for winter wheat respectively kang et al 2003 allen et al 1998 the depth of soil wet layer was set to 60 cm according to root distribution of winter wheat 90 and 65 of the field capacity were used as the upper and lower limits of irrigation on the basis of preliminary experiment and soil property respectively and the soil wetted percentage was assumed to be 60 based on the above data the calculated irrigation amount was 28 9 mm therefore irrigation amount was set as 30 mm in this study when the accumulative etc close or reached 30 mm after last irrigation including more than 30 mm precipitation and there was no precipitation forecast including light rain 10 mm sunny cloudy and overcast for the next three days irrigation will be carried out before planting all phosphorus p ca h2po4 2 h2o 120 kg hm 2 potassium k kcl 90 kg hm 2 and 20 nitrogen were surface broadcast as base fertilizer before rotary tillage and remaining nitrogen was applied by using drip fertigation system at regreening 20 jointing stage 20 booting stage 20 and grain filling stage 20 respectively the specific irrigation and nitrogen management strategies were shown in table 1 winter wheat was planted following the harvest of summer maize the summer maize has the same treatments with the winter wheat except for the nitrogen application amount the nitrogen application amount for summer maize were 210 150 90 and 0 kg hm 2 for n1 n2 n3 and nn respectively owing to prevention in advance there was no disease or pests in two years 2 3 monitoring indicators 2 3 1 basic seedling number tiller number tillers per plant and effective spike rate in each plot three areas of 1 m2 were used to count basic seedling number bsn at two leaves fully developed stage and maximum tiller

to measure grain yield and the spike number of each area was counted the grain number in each spike of 15 individuals was recorded in each area the grains were then manually removed from the spikes and 5 groups of thousand kernel weight also were recorded 2 3 4 soil water content the soil samples at each location 0 and 30 cm distances to the drip irrigation tape were collected at depth of 0 120 cm with 20 cm increments from each plot at the time of winter wheat sowing and harvest the average soil water content swc determined by using the gravimetric method of three replicates was used to present the swc of each treatment 2 3 5 water use efficiency water use efficiency wue was calculated according to the eq 3 3 wue kg m 3 gy et a where gy is grain yield kg hm 2 et a is actual crop

software and differences between the means were evaluated using least significant difference lsd multiple comparison tests at the p 0 05 level the structural equation model sem is an extension of factor analysis and is designed primarily to test substantive theory from empirical data which is an advanced and robust multivariate statistical method for testing complex path relation networks grace et al 2007 malaeb et al 2000 in this study we assumed that irrigation and nitrogen application amount directly or indirectly affect grain yield and sem was used to infer these direct and or

and effective spike rate the basic seedling numbers bsn of winter wheat ranged from 232 7 to 266 0 104 hm 2 in 2018 2019 growing season ranged from 244 3 to 262 7 104 hm 2 in 2019 2020 growing season table 2 the bsn had insignificant difference among different irrigation and nitrogen management but the maximum tiller number tn significantly increased with increasing nitrogen application amount due to increasing number of tillers per plant tp the tp ranged from 0 7 to 4 0 in 2018 2019 and ranged from 0 5 to 4 3 in 2019 2020 growing season nitrogen had highly significant effects on tn and tp p 0

sd and tkw p 0 05 but had highly significant effects on gn during two growing seasons p 0 01 in 2018 2019 growing season the sd ranged from 393 2 to 604 3 104 hm 2 and the highest sd was observed at fin2 the gn ranged from 17 1 to 43 2 and the highest gn was observed at fin1 in 2019 2020 growing season the sd ranged from 296 3 to 628 7 104 hm 2 and the highest sd was observed at din2 the gn ranged from 16 4 to 39 5 and the highest gn was observed at fin2 the tkw ranged from 37 3 to 44 7 g in 2018 2019 growing season ranged from 35 6 to 44 4 g in 2019 2020 growing season over two growing seasons the sd firstly increased and then maintained stability with increasing nitrogen application amount fig 2a and b and the gn firstly increased and then decreased with increasing nitrogen application amount fig 2c and d however the tkw continued to decrease with increasing nitrogen application amount fig 2e and f irrigation significantly increased the sd and gn but the impact on tkw showed uncertainty during two growing seasons fig 3 in 2018 2019 the sd had insignificant difference among din2 din1 fin2 and fin1 treatments and the gn had insignificant difference among between fin1 and din2 in 2019 2020 the sd had insignificant difference among din2 din1 fin2 and fin1 treatments and the gn had insignificant difference among fin1 fin2 and din2 treatments 3 3 grain yield biomass and the relationship between grain yield and yield components the grain yield gy and biomass bio initially increased and then maintained stability with the increasing nitrogen application amount 0 255 kg n hm 2 in both growing seasons table 4 from nn to n2 the gy increased by 135 and 200 and the bio increased by 124 and 178 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons respectively however the gy and bio of winter wheat had insignificant difference between n2 and n1 levels p 0 05 from n2 to n1 the gy only changed 1 and 2 and the bio only changed 2 and 0 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons respectively the gy and bio of di and fi had insignificant difference over two growing seasons but both significantly higher than rf treatment p 0 05 table 5 shows the gy of winter wheat the yield increase rate of each treatment compared with rfnn and the contribution rate of irrigation nitrogen and i n to the yield increase respectively under rf condition compared with rfnn the yield increase rate of other treatments ranged from 90 to 128 due to the application of nitrogen under di and fi condition compared with rfnn the yield increase of dinn and finn was due to the irrigation but the yield increase of other treatments was due to irrigation nitrogen and i n rfnn treatment had the lowest gy which were 3 04 and 2 46 t hm 2 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively din2 treatment achieved the highest gy which were 9 10 and 9 28 t hm 2 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively the gy of din2 increased by 200 and 277 compared with rfnn treatment in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively the contribution of irrigation nitrogen and i n to the increased yield were 66 19 and 15 in 2018 2019 growing season were 77 18 and 5 in 2019 2020 growing season respectively for the nitrogen application treatment the contribution of nitrogen to the yield increase of winter wheat exceeded 60 which indicating that the application of nitrogen is the main factor in the yield increase of winter wheat under drip fertigation in guanzhong plain the positive relationship was observed between gy and sd and gy and gn but the negative relationship existed between gy and tkw fig 4 which indicating that the increased gy was due to the higher sd and gn in this study 3 4 the effects of irrigation and nitrogen on grain yield and yield components based on structure equation model the structure equation model sem was successfully developed to illustrate the interrelationships of farmland management irrigation and nitrogen and gy fig 5 shows that the model adequately fitted the data with rmsea 0 05 nfi 0 95 cfi 0 95 in 2018 2019 nitrogen had significant direct effects on sd gn and tkw but irrigation had significant direct effects on sd and gn and had insignificant direct effects on tkw about 75 of sd 73 of gn and 63 of tkw variation were directly and indirectly explained by irrigation and nitrogen in 2019 2020 both irrigation and nitrogen had significant direct effects on sd gn and tkw about 86 of sd 61 of gn and 62 of tkw variation were directly and indirectly explained by irrigation and nitrogen the irrigation and nitrogen had positive effects on sd gn and tkw except nitrogen had the negative effects on tkw the negative correlations existed between sd and tkw of winter wheat the influence of nitrogen to sd gn and tkw was relatively stronger than irrigation the path coefficients λ were 0 84 0 80 and 0 68 in 2018 2019 were 0 92 0 76 and 0 54 in 2019 2020 growing season respectively the gn had the strongest influence on the gy λ was 0 71 and 0 56 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons and tkw had a relatively weak influence on gy λ was 0 14 and 0 24 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons but the influence of sd gn and tkw on gy all reached the significant level p 0 05 3 5 actual evapotranspiration water and nitrogen use efficiency irrigation and nitrogen had highly significant effects on actual evapotranspiration eta water use efficiency wue and nitrogen use efficiency nue in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 p 0 01 growing seasons except irrigation had significant effects on wue in 2018 2019 growing season p 0 05 table 6 the i n had highly significant effects on eta and nue over two growing seasons p 0 01 except i n had significant effects on eta in 2018 2019 growing season p 0 05 however i n had insignificant effects on wue in 2018 2019 growing season p 0 05 and had significant effects on wue in 2019 2020 growing season p 0 05 over two growing seasons eta increased with the increase of nitrogen application amount under the same irrigation condition table 6 irrigation significantly increase eta of winter wheat compared with the rf treatment for winter wheat the w soil water storage at harvest minus soil water storage at sowing of all treatments were less than 0 which indicating that the soil water was consumed by winter wheat and the soil water consume of rf was higher than that of irrigation treatments di and fi under the same nitrogen application condition the highest eta was observed at fin2 treatment which had insignificant difference with eta of fin1 in 2018 2019 and of fin1 and fin3 in 2019 2020 but significantly higher than other treatments the highest wue 2 19 kg m 3 in 2018 2019 2 03 kg m 3 in 2019 2020 of winter wheat was observed at din2 treatment but had insignificant difference with fin1 fin2 and din1 treatments in 2018 2019 and din1 treatment in 2019 2020 p 0 05 the nue of winter wheat showed the decreasing trends with the increase of nitrogen application amount irrigation can significantly increase nue of winter wheat under the same nitrogen application condition the highest nue was observed at din3 treatment over two growing seasons 4 discussion in this study the basic seedling number bsn had insignificant difference among all treatments p 0 05 which provides a unified basis for experiment table 2 the bsn of our experiment ranged from 232 7 to 266 0 104 hm 2 during two growing seasons which is consistent with wu et al 2007 who reported that the winter wheat can obtain high grain yield when the bsn is around 240 0 104 hm 2 spike density sd grain number per spike gn and thousand kernel weight tkw plays vital role in determining grain yield gy and these can be affected by variety environmental condition and agronomic management du et al 2015 liu et al 2019 li et al 2019 previous studies have demonstrated that crop yield components can be regulated by irrigation and nitrogen zhang et al 2021 yan et al 2019 in this study the maximum tiller number significantly increased with increasing nitrogen application amount table 2 but the sd had insignificant difference between ni 255 kg n hm 2 and n2 170 kg n hm 2 levels table 3 the reason may be that the excessive tillers leads to strong competition among individual plants and finally led to lower effective spike rate table 2 a similar result also was demonstrated by zhang et al 2020 who reported that excessive nitrogen application increased the unproductive tillers growth which waste more accumulated dry matter in addition strong competition always leads to slender and higher plants which increased the risk of lodging and disease zheng et al 2016 alemu and bayisa 2016 the gy increased with the increase of sd which is in line with previous result that sd had the positive effects on gy zhang et al 2021 however the negative correlations existed between sd and tkw and the gy decreased with the increase of tkw fig 4c these results may be explained by competition of yield components of winter wheat sd gn and tkw previous research reported that excessive sd inhibits grain filling grain filling rate and active grain filling period and reduces grain weight liu et al 2021 although the application of nitrogen had significant negative impact on tkw fig 5 these losses can be compensated by increased sd and gn finally achieved higher gy tables 3 and 5 a similar result also was reported by zhang et al 2021 who reported that the increased yield from 6 t hm 2 to 6 t hm 2 was due to an increase in grain number per meter sd gn in this study irrigation had significant direct positive effects on sd and gn fig 5 but the effects on tkw varied in different years fig 5 and table 3 the reason may be related with the distribution of precipitation fig 1 because water stress during grain filling stage could reduce grain weight royo et al 2000 in this study the gy and biomass of winter wheat had insignificant difference between n2 and n1 treatments p 0 05 but both significantly higher than other n treatment and the gy and biomass of di and fi had insignificant difference over two growing seasons but both significantly higher than rf treatment table 4 and din2 treatment achieved the highest grain yield table 5 these results indicating that deficit irrigation di with 170 kg n hm 2 n2 could meet the demand of winter wheat for water and nitrogen under drip fertigation in guanzhong plain the similar interval of nitrogen 159 199 kg n hm 2 also was reported by li et al 2020 obtained thorough field experiment in 2018 2019 growing season by using controlled release fertilizer but the highest grain yield of 7 96 t hm 2 was significantly lower than our results 9 t hm 2 ding et al 2019 reported that plastic mulching could improve soil hydrothermal conditions and increase the final spike number and grain yield of winter wheat but the grain yield varies greatly due to precipitation distribution and amount in this study irrigation di and fi was applied based on crop evapotranspiration and precipitation forecast avoiding severe drought stress and over irrigation lu et al 2021 nitrogen was applied with drip fertigation system multi split based on the demand of winter wheat to nitrogen avoiding excessive fertilization in the early period and insufficient nitrogen fertilizer in the late period yan et al 2019 therefore drip fertigation may be more suitable for obtaining high and stable grain yield than plastic mulching and application of controlled release fertilizer in guanzhong plain of china in the context of water shortage and over fertilization improving water and fertilizer resource utilization efficiency is particularly important for sustainable agricultural development in this study the highest wue 2 19 kg m 3 in 2018 2019 2 03 kg m 3 in 2019 2020 of winter wheat was observed at din2 treatment table 6 this result is in line with the conclusion of si et al 2020 conducted under drip irrigation but the value is higher than the highest wue from 2012 to 2015 of 1 84 kg m 3 reported by xu et al 2020 conducted with surface border irrigation in guanzhong plain one reason may be that drip fertigation reduced the soil evaporation and deep seepage yang et al 2020 rafi et al 2019 de pascale et al 2011 the other reason may be that the higher grain yield was achieved in our study because drip fertigation realized the best coupling ratio of water nutrients and air in the root zone in this study the soil water storage at harvest is less than that at sowing table 6 which indicated that the soil water was consumed by winter wheat which may be a third reason why our wue was higher than previous study the water consumption of winter wheat increases the storage space of soil moisture which is beneficial to reduce the risk of nitrate nitrogen leaching in summer maize growing season lu et al 2021 yang et al 2017 our results also showed that the actual evapotranspiration of din2 highest wue and gy treatment in 2018 2019 was 40 mm higher than in 2019 2020 growing season the reason may be that the heavy and continuous precipitation about 80 mm occurred during grain filling period in 2019 2020 growing season fig 1 the nue of din2 was 35 7 and 40 1 kg kg 1 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons respectively this result is obviously higher than that observed in the study of xu et al 2018 who reported that the nue of wheat ranged from 12 7 to 22 5 kg kg 1 across the three years 5 conclusion in this region the deficit drip irrigation 75 etc coupled with 170 kg n hm 2 din2 obtained the highest grain yield and water use efficiency without much reduction in nitrogen use efficiency in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons nitrogen fertilizer is the main factor limiting the yield increase of winter wheat under drip fertigation in guanzhong plain of northwest china for din2 treatment more than 65 and approximately 20 increased yield was contributed by application of nitrogen and irrigation compared with rain fed without nitrogen winter wheat respectively further study should be conducted with various varieties widely cultivated in this region to investigate the sink source relationship dry mater accumulation

nitrogen and irrigation to the increased yield are vital for achieving high grain yield gy water and nitrogen use efficiency wue and nue in precision agriculture a two year 2018 2020 drip fertigated winter wheat experiment was conducted with three irrigation levels rain fed rf deficit irrigation di 75 etc and full irrigation fi 100 etc as main plot and four nitrogen levels 0 nn 85 n3 170 n2 and 255 n1 kg n hm 2 as subplot in northwest china the results showed that the tillers per plant tp significantly increased with increasing nitrogen application amount 0 255 kg hm 2 but the sd had insignificant difference between n1 and n2 levels due to lower effective spike rate esr of n1 the gn firstly increased and then decreased with increasing nitrogen application amount however the tkw continued to decrease with increasing nitrogen application amount irrigation significantly increased sd and gn but the impact on tkw showed uncertainty during two growing seasons the structure equation model showed that both irrigation and nitrogen indirectly affect gy by affecting yield components and nitrogen had the stronger influence to sd gn and tkw than irrigation in this study the highest gy 9 10 and 9 28 t hm 2 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively was observed at din2 which increased by 200 and 277 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons compared with rfnn treatment respectively and among these increased yield more than 65 and approximately 20 were contributed by the application of nitrogen and irrigation respectively in addition din2 also obtained the highest wue and higher nue due to lower actual evapotranspiration and nitrogen application amount therefore deficit drip irrigation 75 etc coupled with 170 kg n hm 2 was the best management strategy of irrigation and nitrogen under drip fertigation in northwest china keywords spike density grain number thousand kernel weight tiller density structure equation model 1 introduction water security is the foundation of food security and the shortage of water resource has led to a food crisis kang et al 2017 the global population will reach 9 5 billion by 2050 which indicated that the food production from agricultural system must be increased in the future alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 holman et al 2016 spiertz 2013 china as a populous country feeds about 20 of the global population by using about 6 of the global water resources and about 9 of the global arable land unfortunately agricultural water crisis was further aggravated by the increasing water demand of industry and urban life due to the rapid development of society in addition climate change has changed the distribution of precipitation in time and space which resulted in large fluctuations of irrigation water demand in annual and growth stage especially in northwest china xu et al 2020 zheng et al 2019 piao et al 2010 therefore the food security is under tremendous pressure in china agricultural water must be rationally planned and food production must be ensured by improving water use efficiency in china wheat one of the major food crops is widely cultivated over 23 7 million hectares accounting for 20 4 of the total crop planting areas and 24 3 of the total grain crop productions in 2019 in china china statistical yearbook 2020 and the yield gap between potential yield and average farmer s yield was 3 4 t hm 2 liu et al 2016 previous studies have reported that the grain yield gy was directly determined by grain number per spike gn spike density per unit area sd and grain weight li et al 2019 duggan et al 2000 and these yield components can be regulated by irrigation fertilization and other agronomic measures for example liu et al 2021 reported that high planting density and nitrogen application significantly increased sd of wheat but reduced gn and thousand kernel weight tkw li et al 2019 reported that increasing irrigation times could increase 4 6 22 2 of gy by reason of a significant increase in the tkw under micro sprinkling condition water stress occurred in the early season always led to tiller the foundation of sd death of cereal plants resulting in potential yield losses duggan et al 2000 and water stress around anthesis of winter wheat may result in a loss in gy by reducing sd spikelet number and fertility of surviving spikelet while water stress occurred in grain filling stage will reduce grain weight royo et al 2000 giunta et al 1993 it can be seen that the influence of water and nitrogen on wheat yield is mainly through the influence of yield components therefore clarifying the relationship between yield components and application amount of water and nitrogen is particularly important in addition the mutual constraints also existed among yield components for example excessive sd inhibits grain filling and reduces grain weight liu et al 2021 the competitive relationship of sd and gn may be existed from emergence to anthesis yang et al 2018a the gn had strong negative relationships with tkw fischer 2007 therefore balancing yield components and understanding the compensation of yield components are effective way to achieve high crop yield grafius 1978 however previous research mainly focused on the relationship between gy and application amount of irrigation and nitrogen of winter wheat the relationship between yield components of winter wheat and application amount of irrigation and nitrogen under drip fertigation was not clear especially in semi humid and drought prone regions the guanzhong plain is one of the most vital wheat production regions in northwest china and the annual production of wheat account for approximately 40 of the total gy in shaanxi province however the precipitation season from july to september does not synchronized with the winter wheat growing season from october through the following june previous research has reported that the water demand of high yield wheat is about 450 mm chen et al 2006 but only about 200 mm less than 40 of annual precipitation precipitation falls in the wheat growing season which greatly increased the dependence of winter wheat on irrigation seasonal drought stress often leads to low and unstable wheat yields in this region prevailing irrigation strategies flood or border irrigation are heavily dependent on field experiments and practical experience although previous research has given irrigation suggestions for winter wheat in different hydrological year xu et al 2020 it is unrealistic to guide crop irrigation by considering hydrological type and precipitation distribution in growth stage in addition growers in this region usually prefer to apply all of nitrogen n fertilizer at one time before sowing winter wheat which means that the winter wheat often suffered from the shortage of n during the late growth stages to achieve higher gy farmers usually applied excessive water flood or border irrigation and n surface broadcast to the field of winter wheat zhang et al 2015 ruidisch et al 2013 which have resulted in lower water nitrogen use efficiency and environmental pollution gu et al 2013 nayak et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 thus it is necessary to introduce advanced irrigation and fertilization methods and optimize water and nitrogen application amount for improving gy and water nitrogen use efficiency of winter wheat in this region drip fertigation one of the most advanced irrigation and fertilization management technologies could accurately transport nutrients and water to the plant roots accelerating the absorption of nutrients and water by crops li et al 2018 jha et al 2017 and improving crop yield and water fertilizer use efficiency by maximizing the coupling effect of water and fertilizer yan et al 2021 zou et al 2020 wang et al 2018 in addition previous researchers have reported that drip fertigation can minimize the nutrient leaching by split fertilizer according to the requirement of crops to fertilizer lu et al 2021 gardenas et al 2005 mitigate greenhouse gas emission and improve water fertilizer use efficiency compared with traditional irrigation wang et al 2016 tian et al 2017 therefore the optimal application amount of water and nitrogen under drip fertigation may differ with traditional water and nitrogen management although previous researchers have made a lot of research on the response of crop gy and water fertilizer use efficiency to different irrigation and n supply under drip fertigation these studies mainly focused on economic chen et al 2020 wang et al 2018 and staple crops of arid and semi arid areas yan et al 2021 zou et al 2020 fanish et al 2011 although yan and et al 2019 2020 carried out an experiment in guanzhong plain with different irrigation and fertilizer application amount under mobile rain proof shelter and concluded that mild water deficit coupled with appropriate fertilizer increased the grain weight they mainly focused on 1 the dynamics of grain filling and grain weight and 2 the accumulation of n p and k ignoring 1 the relationship between yield components and application amount of irrigation and nitrogen and 2 the contribution of nitrogen and irrigation to yield increase under different management strategies in summary the objectives of our research were to 1 investigate the response of wheat yield components to irrigation and nitrogen amount 2 clarify the contribution of irrigation nitrogen and their interaction to the increase of wheat yield under drip fertigation and 3 obtain the optimal combination of irrigation and nitrogen application amount for achieving high gy and wue under drip fertigation in northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the winter wheat field experiment was carried out from october 2018 to june 2020 at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering 34 17 n 108 4 e 506 m shaanxi province of northwest china this region belongs to semi humid and drought prone region in china

in guanzhong plain was manually planted row spacing 20 cm seeding rate 187 5 kg hm 2 on october 10 2018 and october 12 2019 and harvested on june 4 2019 and 2020 respectively in the experiment three irrigation levels rain fed rf deficit irrigation di 0 75 etc and full irrigation fi 1 0 etc as the main plot and four nitrogen levels 0 nn 85 n3 170 n2 and 255 n1 kg hm 2 as the subplot were arranged with three replicates for each treatment etc is the crop evapotranspiration mm d 1 calculated as etc kc et0 et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration calculated according to the references of allen et al 1998 and yan et al 2020 daily et0 was presented in the fig 1 kc is the crop coefficient which was set as 0 4 from the emergence to jointing 1 1 from the jointing to milk stage and 0 4 from the milk stage to harvest time for winter wheat respectively kang et al 2003 allen et al 1998 the depth of soil wet layer was set to 60 cm according to root distribution of winter wheat 90 and 65 of the field capacity were used as the upper and lower limits of irrigation on the basis of preliminary experiment and soil property respectively and the soil wetted percentage was assumed to be 60 based on the above data the calculated irrigation amount was 28 9 mm therefore irrigation amount was set as 30 mm in this study when the accumulative etc close or reached 30 mm after last irrigation including more than 30 mm precipitation and there was no precipitation forecast including light rain 10 mm sunny cloudy and overcast for the next three days irrigation will be carried out before planting all phosphorus p ca h2po4 2 h2o 120 kg hm 2 potassium k kcl 90 kg hm 2 and 20 nitrogen were surface broadcast as base fertilizer before rotary tillage and remaining nitrogen was applied by using drip fertigation system at regreening 20 jointing stage 20 booting stage 20 and grain filling stage 20 respectively the specific irrigation and nitrogen management strategies were shown in table 1 winter wheat was planted following the harvest of summer maize the summer maize has the same treatments with the winter wheat except for the nitrogen application amount the nitrogen application amount for summer maize were 210 150 90 and 0 kg hm 2 for n1 n2 n3 and nn respectively owing to prevention in advance there was no disease or pests in two years 2 3 monitoring indicators 2 3 1 basic seedling number tiller number tillers per plant and effective spike rate in each plot three areas of 1 m2 were used to count basic seedling number bsn at two leaves fully developed stage and maximum tiller

to measure grain yield and the spike number of each area was counted the grain number in each spike of 15 individuals was recorded in each area the grains were then manually removed from the spikes and 5 groups of thousand kernel weight also were recorded 2 3 4 soil water content the soil samples at each location 0 and 30 cm distances to the drip irrigation tape were collected at depth of 0 120 cm with 20 cm increments from each plot at the time of winter wheat sowing and harvest the average soil water content swc determined by using the gravimetric method of three replicates was used to

experiment field for guiding irrigation based on the equation of penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 2 5 data analysis analysis of variance anova was performed via agricolae package in r v 4 0 2 software and differences between the means were evaluated using least significant difference lsd multiple comparison tests at the p 0 05 level the structural equation model sem is an extension of factor analysis and is designed primarily to test substantive theory from empirical data which is an advanced and robust multivariate statistical method for testing complex path relation networks grace et al 2007 malaeb et al 2000 in this study we assumed that irrigation and nitrogen application amount directly or indirectly affect grain yield and sem was used to infer these direct and or

and effective spike rate the basic seedling numbers bsn of winter wheat ranged from 232 7 to 266 0 104 hm 2 in 2018 2019 growing season ranged from 244 3 to 262 7 104 hm 2 in 2019 2020 growing season table 2 the bsn had insignificant difference among different irrigation and nitrogen management but the maximum tiller number tn significantly increased with increasing nitrogen application amount due to increasing number of tillers per plant tp the tp ranged from 0 7 to 4 0 in 2018 2019 and ranged from 0 5 to 4 3 in 2019 2020 growing season nitrogen had highly significant effects on tn and tp p 0

sd and tkw p 0 05 but had highly significant effects on gn during two growing seasons p 0 01 in 2018 2019 growing season the sd ranged from 393 2 to 604 3 104 hm 2 and the highest sd was observed at fin2 the gn ranged from 17 1 to 43 2 and the highest gn was observed at fin1 in 2019 2020 growing season the sd ranged from 296 3 to 628 7 104 hm 2 and the highest sd was observed at din2 the gn ranged from 16 4 to 39 5 and the highest gn was observed at fin2 the tkw ranged from 37 3 to 44 7 g in 2018 2019 growing season ranged from 35 6 to 44 4 g in 2019 2020 growing season over two growing seasons the sd firstly increased and then maintained stability with increasing nitrogen application amount fig 2a and b and the gn firstly increased and then decreased with increasing nitrogen application amount fig 2c and d however the tkw continued to decrease with increasing nitrogen application amount fig 2e and f irrigation significantly increased the sd and gn but the impact on tkw showed uncertainty during two growing seasons fig 3 in 2018 2019 the sd had insignificant difference among din2 din1 fin2 and fin1 treatments and the gn had insignificant difference among between fin1 and din2 in 2019 2020 the sd had insignificant difference among din2 din1 fin2 and fin1 treatments and the gn had insignificant difference among fin1 fin2 and din2 treatments 3 3 grain yield biomass and the relationship between grain yield and yield components the grain yield gy and biomass bio initially increased and then maintained stability with the increasing nitrogen application amount 0 255 kg n hm 2 in both growing seasons table 4 from nn to n2 the gy increased by 135 and 200 and the bio increased by 124 and 178 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons respectively however the gy and bio of winter wheat had insignificant difference between n2 and n1 levels p 0 05 from n2 to n1 the gy only changed 1 and 2 and the bio only changed 2 and 0 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons respectively the gy and bio of di and fi had insignificant difference over two growing seasons but both significantly higher than rf treatment p 0 05 table 5 shows the gy of winter wheat the yield increase rate of each treatment compared with rfnn and the contribution rate of irrigation nitrogen and i n to the yield increase respectively under rf condition compared with rfnn the yield increase rate of other treatments ranged from 90 to 128 due to the application of nitrogen under di and fi condition compared with rfnn the yield increase of dinn and finn was due to the irrigation but the yield increase of other treatments was due to irrigation nitrogen and i n rfnn treatment had the lowest gy which were 3 04 and 2 46 t hm 2 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively din2 treatment achieved the highest gy which were 9 10 and 9 28 t hm 2 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively the gy of din2 increased by 200 and 277 compared with rfnn treatment in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively the contribution of irrigation nitrogen and i n to the increased yield were 66 19 and 15 in 2018 2019 growing season were 77 18 and 5 in 2019 2020 growing season respectively for the nitrogen application treatment the contribution of nitrogen to the yield increase of winter wheat exceeded 60 which indicating that the application of nitrogen is the main factor in the yield increase of winter wheat under drip fertigation in guanzhong plain the positive relationship was observed between gy and sd and gy and gn but the negative relationship existed between gy and tkw fig 4 which indicating that the increased gy was due to the higher sd and gn in this study 3 4 the effects of irrigation and nitrogen on grain yield and yield components based on structure equation model the structure equation model sem was successfully developed to illustrate the interrelationships of farmland management irrigation and nitrogen and gy fig 5 shows that the model adequately fitted the data with rmsea 0 05 nfi 0 95 cfi 0 95 in 2018 2019 nitrogen had significant direct effects on sd gn and tkw but irrigation had significant direct effects on sd and gn and had insignificant direct effects on tkw about 75 of sd 73 of gn and 63 of tkw variation were directly and indirectly explained by irrigation and nitrogen in 2019 2020 both irrigation and nitrogen had significant direct effects on sd gn and tkw about 86 of sd 61 of gn and 62 of tkw variation were directly and indirectly explained by irrigation and nitrogen the irrigation and nitrogen had positive effects on sd gn and tkw except nitrogen had the negative effects on tkw the negative correlations existed between sd and tkw of winter wheat the influence of nitrogen to sd gn and tkw was relatively stronger than irrigation the path coefficients λ were 0 84 0 80 and 0 68 in 2018 2019 were 0 92 0 76 and 0 54 in 2019 2020 growing season respectively the gn had the strongest influence on the gy λ was 0 71 and 0 56 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons and tkw had a relatively weak influence on gy λ was 0 14 and 0 24 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons but the influence of sd gn and tkw on gy all reached the significant level p 0 05 3 5 actual evapotranspiration water and nitrogen use efficiency irrigation and nitrogen had highly significant effects on actual evapotranspiration eta water use efficiency wue and nitrogen use efficiency nue in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 p 0 01 growing seasons except irrigation had significant effects on wue in 2018 2019 growing season p 0 05 table 6 the i n had highly significant effects on eta and nue over two growing seasons p 0 01 except i n had significant effects on eta in 2018 2019 growing season p 0 05 however i n had insignificant effects on wue in 2018 2019 growing season p 0 05 and had significant effects on wue in 2019 2020 growing season p 0 05 over two growing seasons eta increased with the increase of nitrogen application amount under the same irrigation condition table 6 irrigation significantly increase eta of winter wheat compared with the rf treatment for winter wheat the w soil water storage at harvest minus soil water storage at sowing of all treatments were less than 0 which indicating that the soil water was consumed by winter wheat and the soil water consume of rf was higher than that of irrigation treatments di and fi under the same nitrogen application condition the highest eta was observed at fin2 treatment which had insignificant difference with eta of fin1 in 2018 2019 and of fin1 and fin3 in 2019 2020 but significantly higher than other treatments the highest wue 2 19 kg m 3 in 2018 2019 2 03 kg m 3 in 2019 2020 of winter wheat was observed at din2 treatment but had insignificant difference with fin1 fin2 and din1 treatments in 2018 2019 and din1 treatment in 2019 2020 p 0 05 the nue of winter wheat showed the decreasing trends with the increase of nitrogen application amount irrigation can significantly increase nue of winter wheat under the same nitrogen application condition the highest nue was observed at din3 treatment over two growing seasons 4 discussion in this study the basic seedling number bsn had insignificant difference among all treatments p 0 05 which provides a unified basis for experiment table 2 the bsn of our experiment ranged from 232 7 to 266 0 104 hm 2 during two growing seasons which is consistent with wu et al 2007 who reported that the winter wheat can obtain high grain yield when the bsn is around 240 0 104 hm 2 spike density sd grain number per spike gn and thousand kernel weight tkw plays vital role in determining grain yield gy and these can be affected by variety environmental condition and agronomic management du et al 2015 liu et al 2019 li et al 2019 previous studies have demonstrated that crop yield components can be regulated by irrigation and nitrogen zhang et al 2021 yan et al 2019 in this study the maximum tiller number significantly increased with increasing nitrogen application amount table 2 but the sd had insignificant difference between ni 255 kg n hm 2 and n2 170 kg n hm 2 levels table 3 the reason may be that the excessive tillers leads to strong competition among individual plants and finally led to lower effective spike rate table 2 a similar result also was demonstrated by zhang et al 2020 who reported that excessive nitrogen application increased the unproductive tillers growth which waste more accumulated dry matter in addition strong competition always leads to slender and higher plants which increased the risk of lodging and disease zheng et al 2016 alemu and bayisa 2016 the gy increased with the increase of sd which is in line with previous result that sd had the positive effects on gy zhang et al 2021 however the negative correlations existed between sd and tkw and the gy decreased with the increase of tkw fig 4c these results may be explained by competition of yield components of winter wheat sd gn and tkw previous research reported that excessive sd inhibits grain filling grain filling rate and active grain filling period and reduces grain weight liu et al 2021 although the application of nitrogen had significant negative impact on tkw fig 5 these losses can be compensated by increased sd and gn finally achieved higher gy tables 3 and 5 a similar result also was reported by zhang et al 2021 who reported that the increased yield from 6 t hm 2 to 6 t hm 2 was due to an increase in grain number per meter sd gn in this study irrigation had significant direct positive effects on sd and gn fig 5 but the effects on tkw varied in different years fig 5 and table 3 the reason may be related with the distribution of precipitation fig 1 because water stress during grain filling stage could reduce grain weight royo et al 2000 in this study the gy and biomass of winter wheat had insignificant difference between n2 and n1 treatments p 0 05 but both significantly higher than other n treatment and the gy and biomass of di and fi had insignificant difference over two growing seasons but both significantly higher than rf treatment table 4 and din2 treatment achieved the highest grain yield table 5 these results indicating that deficit irrigation di with 170 kg n hm 2 n2 could meet the demand of winter wheat for water and nitrogen under drip fertigation in guanzhong plain the similar interval of nitrogen 159 199 kg n hm 2 also was reported by li et al 2020 obtained thorough field experiment in 2018 2019 growing season by using controlled release fertilizer but the highest grain yield of 7 96 t hm 2 was significantly lower than our results 9 t hm 2 ding et al 2019 reported that plastic mulching could improve soil hydrothermal conditions and increase the final spike number and grain yield of winter wheat but the grain yield varies greatly due to precipitation distribution and amount in this study irrigation di and fi was applied based on crop evapotranspiration and precipitation forecast avoiding severe drought stress and over irrigation lu et al 2021 nitrogen was applied with drip fertigation system multi split based on the demand of winter wheat to nitrogen avoiding excessive fertilization in the early period and insufficient nitrogen fertilizer in the late period yan et al 2019 therefore drip fertigation may be more suitable for obtaining high and stable grain yield than plastic mulching and application of controlled release fertilizer in guanzhong plain of china in the context of water shortage and over fertilization improving water and fertilizer resource utilization efficiency is particularly important for sustainable agricultural development in this study the highest wue 2 19 kg m 3 in 2018 2019 2 03 kg m 3 in 2019 2020 of winter wheat was observed at din2 treatment table 6 this result is in line with the conclusion of si et al 2020 conducted under drip irrigation but the value is higher than the highest wue from 2012 to 2015 of 1 84 kg m 3 reported by xu et al 2020 conducted with surface border irrigation in guanzhong plain one reason may be that drip fertigation reduced the soil evaporation and deep seepage yang et al 2020 rafi et al 2019 de pascale et al 2011 the other reason may be that the higher grain yield was achieved in our study because drip fertigation realized the best coupling ratio of water nutrients and air in the root zone in this study the soil water storage at harvest is less than that at sowing table 6 which indicated that the soil water was consumed by winter wheat which may be a third reason why our wue was higher than previous study the water consumption of winter wheat increases the storage space of soil moisture which is beneficial to reduce the risk of nitrate nitrogen leaching in summer maize growing season lu et al 2021 yang et al 2017 our results also showed that the actual evapotranspiration of din2 highest wue and gy treatment in 2018 2019 was 40 mm higher than in 2019 2020 growing season the reason may be that the heavy and continuous precipitation about 80 mm occurred during grain filling period in 2019 2020 growing season fig 1 the nue of din2 was 35 7 and 40 1 kg kg 1 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons respectively this result is obviously higher than that observed in the study of xu et al 2018 who reported that the nue of wheat ranged from 12 7 to 22 5 kg kg 1 across the three years 5 conclusion in this region the deficit drip irrigation 75 etc coupled with 170 kg n hm 2 din2 obtained the highest grain yield and water use efficiency without much reduction in nitrogen use efficiency in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons nitrogen fertilizer is the main factor limiting the yield increase of winter wheat under drip fertigation in guanzhong plain of northwest china for din2 treatment more than 65 and approximately 20 increased yield was contributed by application of nitrogen and irrigation compared with rain fed without nitrogen winter wheat respectively further study should be conducted with various varieties widely cultivated in this region to investigate the sink source relationship dry mater accumulation

9994,countries dependent on small scale agriculture such as bangladesh can be vulnerable to the effects of climate change and variability changes in the occurrence and severity of drought are an important part of this issue and form the subject of this paper we examined the characteristics of meteorological drought occurrence and severity using the effective drought index edi including the drought events drought chronology onset and ending of drought consecutive drought spells drought frequency intensity and severity using north bengal of bangladesh as a case study the rainfall and temperature dataset of the bangladesh meteorological department bmd for the study region throughout 1979 2018 is utilised the trends of drought are detected by using the mann kendall test and sen slope estimation we evaluated the performance of edi using the standardized precipitation index spi historical drought records and rice production this study finds that seasonal and annual droughts have become more frequent over the period studied in all seasons except the pre monsoon in addition the largest decrease in seasonal edi is found in the monsoon both in the teesta floodplain and barind tract regions in the decades prior to the late 2000s a drought spell typically starts between march and may 15 days and ends with the monsoonal rainfall in june july in the years since the late 2000s monsoon and post monsoon droughts spells have significantly increased overall the peak intensity of droughts are higher in the barind tract than in the teesta floodplain and the frequency and severity of moderate to severe drought are increasing significantly in the barind tract the drought frequency has increased by at least 10 in north bengal of bangladesh over the periods of 1979 2018 though edi is strongly correlated with the spi index our analysis shows that surprisingly rice production is actually decoupled from meteorological drought as identified by the edi and spi hence this research suggests that there are other significant influences on rice yield beyond meteorological drivers this could include effects from differing irrigation infrastructure technology and management strategies in the study regions challenges to agricultural production may be exacerbated in coming years should the identified increasing meteorological drought trends continue data availability the

decreases in yield lu et al 2017 an analysis conducted by karim et al 2012 indicates that rice production would decline by 33 in the major rice growing areas of bangladesh in 25 45 years due to a 14

cope with the effects of climate change because of its population density small size a fragile economy developmental inequality and low adaptive capacities naser 2015 agriculture is the primary source of livelihood contributing 14 23 to the gdp and employing about 40 62 of the labour force finance division 2018 however climate change is expected to affect agriculture significantly and decrease agricultural gdp by 3 1 each year delaporte and maurel 2018 world bank 2010 which will create pressure on the lives and livelihoods of the smallholding farmers khan and shah 2011 this will ultimately affect the nation s food security misra 2017 mohammad atiqur rahman et al 2017 primarily subsistence farming habiba et al 2014 the farming communities are the most vulnerable groups to climate change sugden et al 2014 compared to the other parts of the country the barind tract and the teesta floodplain regions of the northern and north western parts known as north bengal are highly impacted by drought due to high poverty rates dependency on agriculture low adaptive capacity and high variability of annual and seasonal rainfall habiba et al 2014 shahid and behrawan 2008 drought is a recurrent event in these regions paul 1995 over the years the severity frequency and variability of drought have increased in north bengal alamgir et al 2015 kamruzzaman et al 2019a miyan 2015 mohsenipour et al 2018 mondol et al 2017 2016 several studies indicate that the drought has significant impacts on agricultural productions and the natural environment alamgir et al 2015 food and agricultural organization 2006 hossain et al 2014 islam 2009 karim et al 1990 miyan 2015 rahman 2015 ruane et al 2013 sikder and xiaoying 2014 although there have been tremendous improvements in irrigation systems in bangladesh in recent decades agricultural activities remain dependent on seasonal rainfall akter and rahman 2012 a study conducted by islam 2009 indicate that in recent decades north bengal has experienced significant increases in rainfall variability long seasonal scale dry spells and numerous instances of below normal rainfall significantly hampering the crop growth also variability in temperature has a substantial effect on crop yields such as rice and wheat in north bengal amin et al 2015 miah et al 2017 in addition to the climate variability the construction of farraka and teesta dams in the upstream and the uneven distribution of river water have an impact on downstream water flows which often results in the occurrence of floods during the monsoon period and severe droughts during the dry season chowdhury 2010 habiba et al 2011 ho 2016 islam and sarker 2017 mondal and islam 2017 rahman 2013 md abiar rahman et al 2017 therefore agricultural production in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain areas are vulnerable to water shortages and poor water management in contrast a study conducted by brammer 2016 indicates that drought is not a serious problem for agriculture in bangladesh compared to about 30 years ago he pointed that the agricultural productions data do not suggest an increasing impact of drought on agriculture in bangladesh for all of these reasons understanding the dynamics of different types of droughts is very important akter and rahman 2012 delaporte and maurel 2018 freitas and billib 1997 many indices have been used globally for drought characterisation over the past few decades based on the effectiveness data availability and climatic characteristics bandyopadhyay and saha 2016 the strength and weakness of currently used drought indices can be found in svoboda et al 2016 the standardised precipitation index spi is the most popular meteorological drought index byun et al 2010 however upon analysing the limitations of the current drought indices the effective drought index edi has been proposed as a useful tool to distinguish and characterise droughts byun and wilhite 1996 1999 a detailed analysis comparison of drought indices and advantages of edi over other indices can be found elsewhere in byun and wilhite 1999 byun and kim 2010 and deo et al 2017 edi can be used to monitor droughts daily weekly monthly or seasonal basis or for any other specific period and can be applied worldwide byun and wilhite 1999 deo et al 2017 smakhtin and hughes 2007 this index s main strength is the ability to detect the onset and end of the drought and drought conditions earlier than any other indices jain et al 2015 zarei et al 2017 most of the current indices use normalised statistical metrics to analyse the deficit periods mishra and singh 2010 2011 while their multi scale drought characterisation is ranging from the month smallest time scale to longer periods deo et al 2017 these indices are not considered the daily consecutive or accumulated stress of drought byun and wilhite 1999 drought severity is calculated mostly from the climatological mean of water deficiency for some predefined duration without considering the diminishing of water resources over time studies have confirmed that edi is more efficient than the spi in assessing both short term e g daily weekly and monthly and long term e g seasonal and annual droughts byun et al 2010 dogan et al 2012 spi measurement is based on the probabilistic distribution frequency of which depends on the time period and need aggregation of the rainfall mckee et al 1993 is not suitable for drought ranking gonzález and valdés 2006 byun and kim 2010 compared the edi with the spi and their analysis indicates that edi detects short term long term drought that cannot be detected by the long term short term spis respectively in addition they pointed out that the short term spis do not detect a short term rainfall create many values for the same period consider the same weight for both long past rainfall and recent precipitation may overestimate the relatively low rainfall shortage moreover complexity with determining the appropriate base period for drought analysis is often difficult to find out the start of drought using the most current indices byun and wilhite 1999 deo et al 2017 jain et al 2015 in contrast to these limitations edi considers any rainfall amount and rainfall day one single value for the day or period long memory of rainfall 365 days and the consecutive weight of rainfall confirming that edi is superior to spi in measuring the drought severity byun and kim 2010 spi has limitations for continuous monitoring of drought status deo et al 2017 moreover morid et al 2006 cited in deo et al 2017 indicates that edi is better for detecting the start and end of drought than the percent of normal spi china z index and the z score edi can be used due to its self defined time step which is free from setting up time step problem byun and wilhite 1999 deo et al 2017 jain et al 2015 in addition considering the multiple data requirements many indices are not feasible for some regions e g pdsi thus it can be concluded that edi may be most effective in characterising drought in some regions though there have been numerous studies on the impacts of climate change in bangladesh there are few studies on drought characterisation which are either model based or based on farmers perception without quantifying agricultural impacts using agricultural production data akter and rahman 2012 dash et al 2012 habiba et al 2014 jabber et al 1982 jabber 1990 kamruzzaman et al 2018 karim et al 1990 mazid et al 2005 mondol et al 2016 rafiuddin et al 2011 rahman et al 2018 saleh et al 2000 shahid and behrawan 2008 moreover so far no comprehensive study was done to analyse the chronology of drought and accumulated drought severity in bangladesh again almost no study has been conducted to analyse the onset and end of the drought and its peak intensity most of the existing work lack the study of the relationship between drought and agricultural production in bangladesh edi has been used recently in bangladesh kamruzzaman et al 2019b however so far no comprehensive study has been undertaken to evaluate and assess seasonal or growing period droughts in the important agro ecological zone of the barind tract and the teesta floodplain area in north bengal thus it is difficult to draw conclusions about past events and plan for future impacts such work is necessary to detect and monitor future drought spells and their intensity to support policymaking to fulfil this knowledge gap the present paper aims to look for evidence of secular trends in the frequency or severity of meteorological drought and quantify any changes in agricultural output that might be linked to the secular trends in drought occurrence though this research is based on two specific agro ecological areas the methods we used and insights into the effectiveness of edi for drought characterisation and the impact of meteorological drought on crop production are applicable to similar regions in bangladesh and elsewhere 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area encompasses the barind tract and the teesta floodplain which are two of the main agro ecological zones in bangladesh it is located to the west of the brahmaputra river and the north of the ganges padma river in the north western part of bangladesh fig 1 this area consists of the major parts of the rajshahi and rangpur divisions the barind tract occupies about 8720 km2 while the teesta floodplain inhabits about 2071 km2 faisal et al 2005 mondal and islam 2017 most of the barind tract lands are high to medium high lands whereas most of the teesta floodplain lands are medium high to medium lowlands high land is considered to be above the normal flood level a flood whose inundation area exceeds 21 of the total land of the country while medium highland and medium lowlands are commonly flooded between 90 and 180 cm deep during the flood season mirza 2002 non calcareous grey floodplain and non calcareous brown floodplain soils are the predominant soil types on the teesta floodplain whereas the deep red brown terrace soil and deep grey terrace soils are the major components of the barind tract soils bangladesh bureau of statistics 2019 the temporal distribution of rainfall temperature humidity and wind speed in this region can be characterised into pre monsoon march may monsoon june september post monsoon october november and winter december february seasons 2 2 data 2 2 1 climatic data forty years 1979 2018 of daily rainfall and temperature data for the teesta floodplain rangpur and dinajpur weather stations and the barind tract bogra and rajshahi weather stations regions are obtained from the bangladesh meteorological department bmd fig 1 2 2 2 yield data the production of different types of rice data boro aus aman for the study area was obtained from the bangladesh bureau of statistics bbs boro rice is cultivated during the winter season thus it highly depends on irrigation shahid 2011 in contrast aus and aman rice are cultivated from march to june and june july to october november respectively mainuddin et al 2021 aus rice cultivation depends on pre monsoon rainfall while aman rice cultivation depends on monsoonal rainfall ghose et al 2021 mainuddin et al 2021 2 2 3 missing data and data infilling methods a small number of missing data days are infilled prior to analysis table 1 of the four sites three sites have less than 0 59 of days of missing data across all months in the study period most months have no missing data over the full period one site rangpur has 2 56 of days in july august and september missing and smaller proportions of data missing in april and december in this study missing data for a specific day for a given station is infilled by the average of the nearest two stations for that day the infilled data are then visually examined using boxplots to identify any potential outliers with none being found the small proportion of missing data is therefore deemed not to influence the results significantly 2 2 4 time series analysis of rainfall the boxplot in fig 2 shows the total monthly rainfall distribution at meteorological stations of the barind tract and teesta floodplain the probability distributions pdf of rainfall at annual seasonal and daily time step are shown in supplementary figs 3 4 and 5 results show that the annual pdf for all regions portray a symmetric or bell shape pattern which indicates the normal distribution of the data on the other hand for seasonal pdfs we can see a positively skewed and asymmetric distribution in winter and post monsoon season while symmetric or normal distribution exists in pre monsoon and monsoon season for the daily pdfs we can see that for all seasons and regions an asymmetric distribution exists for rainfall overall we can say that for annual pre monsoon and monsoon seasons any kind of symmetric distribution is suitable for analysis while for winter post monsoon and daily rainfall any kind of asymmetric distribution or positively skewed distribution is fit for analysis autocorrelation functions for the different observations are shown in supplementary fig 6 we find no serial correlation or autocorrelation among the data which indicate that data has no specific pattern and series are absolutely random and will not hamper our analysis 2 3 analytical techniques 2 3 1 identification of drought occurrences using edi edi is based on the concept of daily effective precipitation ep byun and wilhite 1999 ep is the summed precipitation p which is a time dependant reduction function based on the current and antecedent rainfall with time deo et al 2017 kamruzzaman et al 2019b if pm is the daily rainfalls and n is the preceding period then ep for the current day can be calculated as deo et al 2017 kamruzzaman et al 2019b 1 ep n 1 i m 1 n p m n p 1 p 1 p 2 2 p 1 p 2 p 3 3 p 1 p 2 p 365 365 p 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 365 p 2 1 2 1 3 1 365 p 365 1 365 where i is the duration of summation we use 365 as the initial i value which is the annual precipitation cycle and can be used as a characteristics value of the total water resources available or stored for a long period byun and wilhite 1999 in this study the daily eps for each day from jan 1 1979 to dec 31 2018 and the climatological mean ep mep for each calendar day i e from 1 to 365 are calculated for 40 years 1979 2018 for example the mep for the 1st of january is the mean of 40 values for the 1st day of january composed of over 40 years kamruzzaman et al 2019b then the deviation of the ep dep from the mep is calculated as 2 dep ep mep a negative dep indicates the deficiency of water resources for a particular day while a positive value of dep indicates a surplus of water resources finally the edi is calculated as 3 edi dep st dep where st dep is the standard deviation of each day s dep however for a dry period longer than 365 days we recalculate the ep and edi again by increasing the value of i in eq 1 as the number of dry days increases for instance if the negative dep value continues for 2 days i is set to be 365 2 1 366 byun and wilhite 1999 kamruzzaman et al 2019b jain et al 2015 therefore the accumulated impact of drought on soil that occurred several years ago 365 days is also reflected in the edi jain et al 2015 the seasonal and annual edi is also calculated using eq 4 where q m is the rainfall m 1 months before the current month and n is the duration of the preceding period then the ep for the current month is calculated as smakhtin and hughes 2007 4 ep n 1 j m 1 n q m n j is the summation of the duration i e the number of months for example if n 4 then 5 ep p 1 p 1 p 2 2 p 1 p 2 p 3 3 p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 4 where p 1 p 2 p 3 and p 4 are precipitation values during the current month the previous month 2 months before and 3 months before respectively smakhtin and hughes 2007 the drought severity is classified and shown in table 2 2 3 2 estimation of drought severity and duration onset and ending the severity of drought ds and peak drought intensity pdi are computed deo et al 2017 as 6 ds k 1 n edi k 0 7 pdi min edi dd where k is the date after the onset of negative edi value edi k is the continuous days with negative edi value during the drought dd period a drought period is the cumulative number of days with continuous negative edi values starting from the day with the onset of negative edi to the last day with negative edi value the annual total of negative edi values in a year which is termed as the accumulated edi aedi is used to calculate the annual severity of the drought the chronological annual dryness and intensity are computed using yeadi365 and yeadind kim et al 2009 yaedi365 is the sum of negative edi divided by 365 days which indicates the annual dryness of an area in contrast the yeadind is the sum of negative edi divided by the total number of days of negative edis which indicates the annual intensity of drought if yeadi365 is equal to yeadind for a particular year it means drought conditions existed over the whole year kim et al 2009 8 yeadi 365 sum of negative edi 365 9 yeadi nd sum of negative edi total number of days of negative edi 10 sum of negative edi k 1 365 edi k 0 in this study based on the drought duration and the peak drought intensity values the top 20 cases of the highest drought spell are identified and analysed 2 3 3 identification of the consecutive drought spells in this study a drought episode that exists for more than 3 months 90 days is considered a long term drought spell while a consecutive dry period that lasts for more than 1 month 30 days and less than 3 months 90 days is considered as a medium term drought spell a drought spell that lasts for more than 1 week 7 days but less than 1 month 30 days is considered as a short term drought spell 2 3 4 estimation of the drought frequency the frequency of daily drought per year dfy for edi 0 and edi 1 over 1979 2018 is analysed by using the following equation zhao et al 2018 11 df y total number of drought days in the year total number of days in the year 100 moreover we analyse the drought frequency for different months and different starting and ending periods for example for the drought period starting in january and ending in june the 6 month edi frequency is calculated in the same way for the winter season beginning in december and ending in february the 3 month drought frequency is computed thus for any drought period dfp starting and ending between january to december monthly to 12 month drought frequencies are calculated as 12 df p total number of edi negative days in the month period over 1979 2018 total number of days in the month period over 1979 2018 100 2 3 5 analysis of the pattern of meteorological drought the pattern of drought over the 1979 2018 period is analysed using the mann kendall mk test and sen slope estimation hamed 2008 neeti and eastman 2011 sen 1968 yürekli 2015 to find out whether the median slope is statistically different than zero we calculated the confidence interval of the time slope gilbert 1987 gocic and trajkovic 2013 hollander et al 2014 moreover we calculated the upper and lower limit of the slope the slope is statistically different from zero when the upper and lower limits of the slope have the same sign gocic and trajkovic 2013 2 3 6 evaluation of the edi performance drought is a seldom studied hazard in bangladesh and very few studies have been conducted on the monitoring and prediction of droughts by the government or non government organisations in bangladesh brammer 1987 miyan 2015 rahaman et al 2016 the drought history and drought related records are not well documented kamruzzaman et al 2019b only brief discussions of crop damages and production losses are found in some reports published by the bangladesh bureau of statistics bbs thus it is difficult to identify and recognise a drought year based on bbs reports only hence in addition to bbs results we cross checked our results with existing peer reviewed published sources conducted in the study area selvaraju and baas 2007 rafiuddin et al 2011 alamgir et al 2015 mondol et al 2016 rahman and lateh 2016 nury and hasan 2016 mamun et al 2018 kamruzzaman et al 2019a 2019b since the study area is also prone to floods and agricultural production is understood to be low during years with flood conditions this study computed correlations between the edi and agricultural production in non flood years edi 0 99 only to evaluate the performance of edi values we also performed index to index evaluation and compared the edi results with the standardised precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 for this evaluation we conducted pearson correlation r and co efficient of determination r2 between edi and spi for different seasons and annual scale moreover we performed detrending of the rice productions and evaluated the anomaly of detrended rice productions with mean detrended rice productions and edi finally we plotted the spi and edi data in quantile quantile q q plots to determine the extent to which the edi and spi share a common probability distribution 3 results 3 1 daily drought occurrence figs 3 and 4 shows the daily drought occurrences in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain regions based on edi values and drought severity classification the results show substantial inter annual variability in drought over time in both regions in most years the first 100 120 days of the calendar year experience mild drought with some moderate drought in this period drought conditions tend to increase from march to may although there is high variability in the drought severity during this period april and may days 91 151 have the highest number of drought days across the whole period though mid june to september days 166 273 is the monsoon time some dry spells are found in this period with some severe drought conditions in 1983 1992 1994 95 1996 2006 2009 10 2012 13 2014 and 2018 during october november the number of drought days has increased after 2008 overall the number of drought days and drought occurrences are higher in the barind tract than in the teesta floodplain 3 2 seasonal to annual drought occurrence seasonal and annual occurrences of drought throughout 1979 2018 are shown in fig 5 the study area faces mild to moderate drought conditions during the winter period the pre monsoon season is the most drought prone season in north bengal of bangladesh when the barind tract and the teesta floodplain experiences all severe categories of drought analysis indicates that the study area frequently experiences drought conditions between 1991 and 1997 including an extreme drought condition during 1994 1995 in addition these two areas also suffer from severe to extreme drought in 1979 1982 1995 and 2012 different locations in the study area are hit by moderate to severe drought in 1981 1986 1989 1992 1996 2007 2010 and 2014 the monsoon drought is found to be increasing in both the barind tract and the teesta floodplain fig 5 extreme droughts hit the teesta floodplain during the growing seasons in 1994 and 2018 while severe droughts hit the barind tract in 1982 2010 2016 and 2018 recent decades show an increase in drought during the monsoon periods overall the frequency and severity of monsoon drought have increased throughout 1979 2018 the post monsoon drought is also found increasing fig 5 annual edi analysis finds that over 1979 2018 at least two severe to extreme droughts hit the teesta floodplain while three severe to the extreme and six moderates to severe droughts hit the barind tract the results suggest that the annual drought severity has also increased and the north bengal experiences dry conditions once every 2 to 3 years 3 3 chronological annual dryness fig 6 shows the chronological annual dryness the result indicates that in the teesta floodplain the intensity yaedi nd and annual dryness yaedi 365 are both high in 1994 1995 and 2018 in comparison to other years while similar conditions prevail in the barind tract in 1982 1992 2006 and 2010 however the intensity is found higher than 1 5 during the years of 1979 1982 1992 1994 95 2006 2014 and 2018 than in other years for both regions it indicates that there is a prolonged dry period in those years the chronological annual dryness results also suggest that the intensity and annual dryness are higher in the barind tract than in the teesta floodplain 3 4 indexing drought severity the drought severity index is constructed to understand whether the annual severity of drought shows consistency in consecutive years fig 7 fig 7 a shows that the highest severity of drought occurs in 2010 in the barind tract when the total negative edi exceeds 400 in contrast the teesta floodplain reaches the peak of drought severity in 1994 95 and the total negative edi is about 650 during 2009 11 the drought lasts for about 570 days in the barind tract while in 1994 95 a prolonged drought condition exists for more than 387 days in the teesta floodplain the other notable years for severe annual droughts in the barind tract are 1982 1992 2006 2009 2012 2013 and 2018 while the remarkable severe drought severity years in the teesta floodplain are 1979 1981 2001 2006 2014 and 2018 the total number of dry days increases significantly in recent decades compared to the first decades of the 1979 2018 period fig 7 b the highest number of total dry days and the peak drought intensity takes place in the year 2010 in the barind tract severe peak drought intensity is prevalent in 1979 and 1989 in this area severe to extreme peak in drought intensity occurs in the teesta floodplain in 1979 1994 1995 and 2014 the peak intensity is found low during 1984 1988 and 1998 2005 periods in both the areas fig 7 c the results indicate that the study area suffers from severe to extreme drought on average once every 10 years fig 8 shows the seasonal total dry days for different seasons in the study area which indicate that the total dry days are increasing day by day in recent decades and the increase is significant in the winter and post monsoon seasons for both areas and in the monsoon season for the teesta floodplain region 3 5 frequency of drought the highest drought frequency about 76 of days of the year is found in 2010 in the barind tract whereas this condition prevails in the teesta floodplain in 1994 when edi less than 1 exists for more than half a year fig 9 the frequency and magnitude of drought are also high during these 2 years during the first 20 years of the 1979 2018 period the frequency of daily drought conditions is higher in 1979 1982 83 1989 1992 and 1994 95 than in other years while in the recent 20 years the frequency of daily drought conditions is higher in 2001 2006 2009 10 2013 2014 2016 and 2018 in the teesta floodplain the days with edi less than 1 occur in 1979 1981 1989 1994 1995 2001 2006 2014 2017 and 2018 however the frequency of drought is relatively low in 1983 1986 and 2002 2005 in general the frequency of moderate to severe droughts is increasing significantly in the barind tract fig 9 the frequencies of drought in different starting and ending months from 1 month to 12 months are shown in fig 10 the results suggest that meteorological drought is mainly seasonal and occurs more in pre monsoon and post monsoon the drought frequency is higher in the barind tract than in the teesta floodplain fig 10 the results also indicate that the percent of drought frequency has increased in the recent half of the study periods 1999 2018 than in the first half 1979 1998 we find that during the periods of 1979 1998 the highest frequency of drought existed mainly in pre monsoon while during the 1999 2018 periods drought has increased in the post monsoon time while the frequency of mild drought is increasing in the teesta floodplain the moderate to severe drought frequency is increasing in the barind tract the drought frequency has increased by at least 10 in north bengal over 1979 2018 3 6 consecutive drought spells onset and ending of drought the consecutive drought spells in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain region are shown in fig 11 the results indicate that about 27 long dry spells 90 days exist in the teesta floodplain while about 17 long dry spells 90 days are found in the barind tract however drought spells that last for more than 1 month but less than 3 months and more than 1 week but less than 1 month are found more in the barind tract than the teesta floodplain the top 20 drought cases are shown in table 3 based on the duration and peak drought value the results indicate that the highest prolonged duration of the drought is from the mid of june 1994 to the first week of july 1995 in the teesta floodplain while in the barind tract the longest drought spell exists from the end of september 2009 to mid april 2011 during this time negative edi reaches the highest peak at 2 21 in the teesta floodplain and 2 50 in the barind tract regions though the number of consecutive long term drought spells are fewer in the barind tract than in the teesta floodplain the duration of the droughts is longer in the barind tract moreover the peak drought values are also higher in the barind tract than in the teesta floodplain 3 7 the pattern of seasonal drought the results show that the seasonal and annual edi values exhibit a decreasing pattern during all seasons except the pre monsoon period based on the mann kendall test and sen slope estimation in both the barind tract and the teesta floodplain table 4 the highest overall decreasing pattern in seasonal edi is found in the monsoon period in both regions at the same time the barind tract has a higher decrease at the annual scale relative to the teesta floodplain at a 5 level of significance a decrease of edi is found in monsoon and at the annual scale in both the barind tract and the teesta floodplain we find an increasing trend of seasonal edi during pre monsoon in the teesta floodplain which is not significant at a 5 level of significance overall the decreasing pattern of edi is more evident in the barind tract than in the teesta floodplain if these trends continue drought conditions may further exacerbate in the coming years 3 8 evaluation of edi and edi rice production relationship historical records of drought derived from different sources and reports are shown in table 6 which indicate that during the 1979 2018 period droughts occurred in the years 1979 1981 1982 1989 1992 1994 1995 2001 2006 2009 2010 2012 2014 and 2018 these results are in line with our results though agricultural production is significantly increasing year by year fig 12 the drought conditions and agricultural production over 1979 2018 indicate a negative relationship table 5 figs 12 and 13 in addition we find a positive relationship between detrended rice productions and edi only for few years fig 12 overall we did not find any significant relationships among the edis and rice production in the study region which might be related to the uncertainty in the spatial and temporal distributions of the droughts with precipitation alone accounts for the edi does not consider the effects of irrigation and other water sources thus we analyse the performance of edi with spi which is closely related to soil moisture fig 14 shows the q q plot with a coefficient r and the coefficient of determination r between edi and spi the results indicate that edi is strongly correlated with spi which reveals that edi can effectively measure meteorological drought 4 discussion this paper assessed the characteristics of meteorological drought occurrence and severity in two important agro ecological zones namely the barind tract and the teesta floodplain in north bengal bangladesh using edi at different timescales the analysis and results of our study indicate that the patterns of drought variability are significantly different in both short term and long term periods it is evident that the northern and north western part of the country experiences persistent mild to moderate meteorological drought over the winter periods and the severity of meteorological drought is high during pre monsoon and post monsoon figs 3 10 this result is in line with previous studies habiba et al 2014 the number of dry days is increasing based on daily edi analysis while in pre monsoon a non significant decreasing trend is observed in the drought severity frequency and variability in both the barind tract and the teesta floodplain based on seasonal edi figs 3 5 table 4 bangladesh receives two thirds of the annual rainfall in the monsoon ahmed and kim 2003 shahid and khairulmaini 2009 our analysis indicates that the monsoon drought is significantly increasing table 4 the overall severity of the drought has also increased over the period 1979 2018 fig 7 other studies have also equally noted this increasing pattern of drought severity frequency and variability in north bengal alamgir et al 2015 kamruzzaman et al 2019a miyan 2015 mohsenipour et al 2018 mondol et al 2017 2016 the chronology of drought indicates that the annual intensity and dryness are increasing in both areas these results are also in line with other studies habiba et al 2014 kamruzzaman et al 2018 the increasing trend of drought severity for a longer overall timespan of the dataset is important since extreme drought events almost always lead to the loss of agricultural production as observed in many other studies the future change of drought variability is projected to be more crucial and significant especially in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain bari et al 2016 hasan et al 2018 miah et al 2017 mondol et al 2018 nury et al 2017 mohammad atiqur rahman et al 2017 rahman and lateh 2016 ruane et al 2013 mainly because drought represents a non linear combination of numerous meteorological and land surface variables including precipitation temperature wind speed radiation humidity and soil moisture the analysis of climatic variability the trends of rainfall and temperature in the study area indicate that except pre monsoon and post monsoon in the teesta floodplain the long term average rainfall during winter monsoon and annual rainfall for the last 40 years have a decreasing trend fig 15 besides the mean maximum temperature in winter of barind tract regions and pre monsoon of both areas the long term yearly mean maximum and minimum temperature in all other seasons and annual scale have increased fig 15 these findings are similar to those from other studies ahasan et al 1970 basher et al 2018 islam 2009 mondol et al 2018 mullick et al 2019 nury and hasan 2016 md abiar rahman et al 2017 rahman et al 2012 rahman and lateh 2016 syed and al amin 2016 ahmed and kim 2003 since the precipitation deficit is the main driver of meteorological droughts it is expected that the deficit in future precipitation would bring more droughts kamruzzaman et al 2018 however changes in rainfall variability may impact differently high variability of rainfall is observed in the study area in terms of amount and spatiotemporal distributions fig 15 subsequently it has resulted in frequent drought episodes with varying intensities both in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain fig 11 kamruzzaman et al 2018 also indicate that the probability of annual occurrences frequency and percentage of extreme drought occurrence has increased in recent decades in north western parts compare to other parts of the study area the agricultural drought is also projected to high risk in northern districts while high crop production and dependent on irrigation made agriculture at higher risk and vulnerable to drought than other areas of the country kamruzzaman et al 2018 moreover the relevance of the water scarcity problem is pointed out in several pieces of literature indicating that north bengal is more vulnerable to drought basher et al 2018 islam 2009 habiba et al 2014 mondol et al 2018 mullick et al 2019 nury and hasan 2016 rahman et al 2012 rahman and lateh 2016 shahid and behrawan 2008 syed and al amin 2016 drought duration is one of the key elements of drought characteristics huang et al 2019 zargar et al 2011 it is the interval between the onset and ending time of a drought which can vary from months to years in this study we have calculated and analysed the onset and end of droughts in the study area as edi calculation is performed on a daily basis it provides accurate drought information not only for well defined prolonged widespread and intensive droughts but also for very localised and short term droughts byun and wilhite 1999 deo et al 2017 kamruzzaman et al 2019b our results indicate that the onset and end time of droughts in the study area mostly follow the monsoonal rainfall pattern in decades prior to the late 2000s a drought spell typically starts between march to may 15 days and ends with the monsoonal rainfall in june july figs 3 4 in the years since the last 2000s winter and post monsoon droughts days have significantly increased in north bengal fig 8 the highest duration of drought is found in the year 1994 1995 in the teesta floodplain when people suffer from a massive loss of agricultural production especially rice and jute production paul 1995 kamruzzaman et al 2019b the historical drought data of bangladesh indicate that consecutive drought during 1978 79 caused a reduction of 2 million tons of crops followed by a loss of about 0 44 million tons of rice production due to the drought during 1980 81 bbs 1982 during the 1983 84 and 1984 1985 periods a loss of about 0 59 and 1 32 million tons of rice production occurred due to drought conditions bbs 1986 the 1994 1995 drought condition was very severe from which a reduction of at least 3 5 million tons of rice and wheat production was resulted paul 1995 rahman and biswas 1995 about 25 30 reduction of average crop production happened in 2006 because of drought moreover about 5 74 of the damages and losses related to agriculture products and infrastructure were caused by drought between 2009 and 2014 kamruzzaman et al 2019b 2019a in contrast to the observed drought characteristic and existing agricultural productions data of the study area we find that edi and rice production has no strong correlation the moving decadal correlations between edi and different types of rice show that edi is only positively correlated with aman rice during the first eleven moving decades whereas for boro rice edi is positively correlated only during 1982 1995 fig 13 aus rice is found to have a moving decadal correlation with edi in a few years almost no consecutive decadal correlation is found moreover we find no strong correlation between detrended rice productions and edi edi did not successfully account for agricultural losses in north bengal this result is in line with the study of brammer 2016 thus this analysis indicates that the impacts of meteorological drought on agriculture in the study area could be compensated by other factors such as irrigation agricultural management a number of adaptive measures have been recommended to cope with the adverse effect of climatic events impacting agricultural production over the decades in the study area examples include crop replacement irrigation gap filling and inter cropping of local food crop setting up of deep tube wells and ponds for irrigation planting drought tolerant and cultivating short duration crop varieties agronomic management crop intensification and increased use of technology to reduce climate vulnerabilities to climate change ahmed and chowdhury 2006 fao 2006 habiba et al 2012 mainuddin et al 2015 paul 1998 rawlani and sovacool 2011 the irrigation facilities electricity connections high yield varieties and supply of fertiliser have increased remarkably in bangladesh in recent decades bbs 1979 2019 in addition the farakka and teesta dams in the upper stream on the river ganges and the river teesta respectively have a significant impact on agricultural production in north bengal shahid and behrawan 2008 according to afroz and rahman 2013 more than 80 of the water reduced from ganges and teesta rivers due to the construction of the barrage miyan 2015 moreover compound changes in other physical and agronomical factors influencing crop growth would complicate the assessment of yield response to droughts muller et al 2018 seifert and lobell 2015 stewart et al 2005 there are existing significant uncertainties in crop yield simulations in model based studies due to our limited understanding and knowledge of the physical and agronomical process regarding crop growth and yield asseng et al 2011 elliott et al 2015 folberth et al 2016 leng and hall 2019 rosenzweig et al 2014 the research conducted by li et al 2015 indicated that the complete crop failure for rainfed rice over south asia is decreasing and there would not have significant drought impacts on rainfed rice they pointed out that climate change could benefit rainfed rice production in south asia if the rainfed rice season would be adjusted accordingly li et al 2015 a study conducted by gain and giupponi 2015 also indicated that the majority of the yield variations could not be explained by the drought index and the occurrence of a drought event may not necessarily lead to a reduction of yield confirming the importance of re assessing the drought impacts in a probabilistic manner using more agro climatic and technological data the integrated assessment of water scarcity risk is an urgent need in water resources management biswas 2004 gain and giupponi 2015 however we assessed the edi results with the spi index and historical drought data of bangladesh spi is an established drought model and uses to detect meteorological drought in many countries like bangladesh the edi and spi relationship indicate a strong correlation between them while we find no strong correlation between spi and rice productions supplementary fig 7 in contrast the edi results matched the historical drought data table 6 thus edi can successfully characterise the meteorological drought but not account for agricultural losses or productions of the study area 5 limitations of the study effective drought index edi is only based on rainfall data and require daily data in addition the value of i is not well established thus difficult to consider the summation of the rainfall duration moreover drought is also depending on other factors which are not considered in the present study 6 conclusions and recommendations in this study we characterised the meteorological drought occurrence and severity in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain using edi moreover we evaluated the use of edi and its correlation with rice production in the study area the results and findings suggest that droughts in the study area are increasing the consecutive drought spells onset and ending of drought indicate that drought occurs mainly on a seasonal basis with most droughts lasting between 1 and 3 months in the study area overall the peak drought value and the intensity of consecutive drought spells and the seasonal and annual dryness are higher in the barind tract than in the teesta floodplain the annual severity of drought shows consistency with consecutive drought severity notably the pattern of the severity of the meteorological drought is found to increase in addition the increasing patterns of meteorological drought during the monsoon period and at the annual scale are significant both in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain this region suffers dry conditions once every 2 to 3 years and is affected by at least one severe drought every 10 years however our results suggest that the meteorological drought impact on rice production in north bengal has been much less significant than it has been generally assumed to have important implications for national drought and agricultural planning observed drought analysis spi and historical drought data have a good match while possibly due to technological interventions in recent decades rice production is not sensitive to meteorological drought a large portion of yield variation cannot be explained by the drought index since several other factors influencing yield are not considered to summarise we conclude that the severity and frequency of meteorological drought are increasing whereas the trend of rice production is decoupled from that of meteorological drought however we do not know if the technological progress is going to continue but it is important to highlight that the increase in meteorological drought means there would be potentially more challenges in the future if this trend continues moreover these conditions may introduce new dependencies into the small scale agricultural production namely the reliable and affordable provision of fuel and or electric power confirming the importance of re assessing the drought impacts on the potential practical water resources planning and management in the study area using more agro climatic and technological data hence in a new paper the prospect of technological drought when fuel or power are limiting as a new risk factor will be examined and evaluated declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

9994,countries dependent on small scale agriculture such as bangladesh can be vulnerable to the effects of climate change and variability changes in the occurrence and severity of drought are an important part of this issue and form the subject of this paper we examined the characteristics of meteorological drought occurrence and severity using the effective drought index edi including the drought events drought chronology onset and ending of drought consecutive drought spells drought frequency intensity and severity using north bengal of bangladesh as a case study the rainfall and temperature dataset of the bangladesh meteorological department bmd for the study region throughout 1979 2018 is utilised the trends of drought are detected by using the mann kendall test and sen slope estimation we evaluated the performance of edi using the standardized precipitation index spi historical drought records and rice production this study finds that seasonal and annual droughts have become more frequent over the period studied in all seasons except the pre monsoon in addition the largest decrease in seasonal edi is found in the monsoon both in the teesta floodplain and barind tract regions in the decades prior to the late 2000s a drought spell typically starts between march and may 15 days and ends with the monsoonal rainfall in june july in the years since the late 2000s monsoon and post monsoon droughts spells have significantly increased overall the peak intensity of droughts are higher in the barind tract than in the teesta floodplain and the frequency and severity of moderate to severe drought are increasing significantly in the barind tract the drought frequency has increased by at least 10 in north bengal of bangladesh over the periods of 1979 2018 though edi is strongly correlated with the spi index our analysis shows that surprisingly rice production is actually decoupled from meteorological drought as identified by the edi and spi hence this research suggests that there are other significant influences on rice yield beyond meteorological drivers this could include effects from differing irrigation infrastructure technology and management strategies in the study regions challenges to agricultural production may be exacerbated in coming years should the identified increasing meteorological drought trends continue data availability the

sugden et al 2014 compared to the other parts of the country the barind tract and the teesta floodplain regions of the northern and north western parts known as north bengal are highly impacted by

event in these regions paul 1995 over the years the severity frequency and variability of drought have increased in north bengal alamgir et al 2015 kamruzzaman et al 2019a miyan 2015 mohsenipour et al

in bangladesh in recent decades agricultural activities remain dependent on seasonal rainfall akter and rahman 2012 a study conducted by islam 2009 indicate that in recent decades north bengal has experienced significant increases in rainfall variability long seasonal scale dry spells and numerous instances of below normal rainfall significantly hampering the crop growth also variability in temperature has a substantial effect on crop yields such as rice and wheat in north bengal amin et al 2015 miah et al 2017 in addition to the climate variability the construction of farraka and teesta dams in the upstream and the uneven distribution of river water have an impact on downstream water flows which often results in the occurrence of floods during the monsoon period and severe droughts during the dry season chowdhury 2010 habiba et al 2011 ho 2016 islam and sarker 2017 mondal and islam 2017 rahman 2013 md abiar rahman et al 2017 therefore agricultural production in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain areas are vulnerable to water shortages and poor water management in contrast a study conducted by brammer 2016 indicates that drought is not a serious problem for agriculture in bangladesh compared to about 30 years ago he pointed that the agricultural productions data do not suggest an increasing impact of drought on agriculture in bangladesh for all of these reasons understanding the dynamics of different types of droughts is very important akter and rahman 2012 delaporte and maurel 2018 freitas and billib 1997 many indices have been used globally for drought characterisation over the past few decades based on the effectiveness data availability and climatic characteristics bandyopadhyay and saha 2016 the strength and weakness of currently used drought indices can be found in svoboda et al 2016 the standardised precipitation index spi is the most popular meteorological drought index byun et al 2010 however upon analysing the limitations of the current drought indices the effective drought index edi has been proposed as a useful tool to distinguish and characterise droughts byun and wilhite 1996 1999 a detailed analysis comparison of drought indices and advantages of edi over other indices can be found elsewhere in byun and wilhite 1999 byun and kim 2010 and deo et al 2017 edi can be used to monitor droughts daily weekly monthly or seasonal basis or for any other specific period and can be applied worldwide byun and wilhite 1999 deo et al 2017 smakhtin and hughes 2007 this index s main strength is the ability to detect the onset and end of the drought and drought conditions earlier than any other indices jain et al 2015 zarei et al 2017 most of the current indices use normalised statistical metrics to analyse the deficit periods mishra and singh 2010 2011 while their multi scale drought characterisation is ranging from the month smallest time scale to longer periods deo et al 2017 these indices are not considered the daily consecutive or accumulated stress of drought byun and wilhite 1999 drought severity is calculated mostly from the climatological mean of water deficiency for some predefined duration without considering the diminishing of water resources over time studies have confirmed that edi is more efficient than the spi in assessing both short term e g daily weekly and monthly and long term e g seasonal and annual droughts byun et al 2010 dogan et al 2012 spi measurement is based on the probabilistic distribution frequency of which depends on the time period and need aggregation of the rainfall mckee et al 1993 is not suitable for drought ranking gonzález and valdés 2006 byun and kim 2010 compared the edi with the spi and their analysis indicates that edi detects short term long term drought that cannot be detected by the long term short term spis respectively in addition they pointed out that the short term spis do not detect a short term rainfall create many values for the same period consider the same weight for both long past rainfall and recent precipitation may overestimate the relatively low rainfall shortage moreover complexity with determining the appropriate base period for drought analysis is often difficult to find out the start of drought using the most current indices byun and wilhite 1999 deo et al 2017 jain et al 2015 in contrast to these limitations edi considers any rainfall amount and rainfall day one single value for the day or period long memory of rainfall 365 days and the consecutive weight of rainfall confirming that edi is superior to spi in measuring the drought severity byun and kim 2010 spi has limitations for continuous monitoring of drought status deo et al 2017 moreover morid et al 2006 cited in deo et al 2017 indicates that edi is better for detecting the start and end of drought than the percent of normal spi china z index and the z score edi can be used due to its self defined time step which is free from setting up time step problem byun and wilhite 1999 deo et al 2017 jain et al 2015 in addition considering the multiple data requirements many indices are not feasible for some regions e g pdsi thus it can be concluded that edi may be most effective in characterising drought in some regions though there have been numerous studies on the impacts of climate change in bangladesh there are few studies on drought characterisation which are either model based or based on farmers perception without quantifying agricultural impacts using agricultural production data akter and rahman 2012 dash et al 2012 habiba et al 2014 jabber et al 1982 jabber 1990 kamruzzaman et al 2018 karim et al 1990 mazid et al 2005 mondol et al 2016 rafiuddin et al 2011 rahman et al 2018 saleh et al 2000 shahid and behrawan 2008 moreover so far no comprehensive study was done to analyse the chronology of drought and accumulated drought severity in bangladesh again almost no study has been conducted to analyse the onset and end of the drought and its peak intensity most of the existing work lack the study of the relationship between drought and agricultural production in bangladesh edi has been used recently in bangladesh kamruzzaman et al 2019b however so far no comprehensive study has been undertaken to evaluate and assess seasonal or growing period droughts in the important agro ecological zone of the barind tract and the teesta floodplain area in north bengal thus it is difficult to draw conclusions about past events and plan for future impacts such work is necessary to detect and monitor future drought spells and their intensity to support policymaking to fulfil this knowledge gap the present paper aims to look for evidence of secular trends in the frequency or severity of meteorological drought and quantify any changes in agricultural output that might be linked to the secular trends in drought occurrence though this research is based on two specific agro ecological areas the methods we used and insights into the effectiveness of edi for drought characterisation and the impact of meteorological drought on crop production are applicable to similar regions in bangladesh and elsewhere 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area encompasses the barind tract and the teesta floodplain which are two of the main agro ecological zones in bangladesh it is located to the west of the brahmaputra river and the north of the ganges padma river in the north western part of bangladesh fig 1 this area consists of the major parts of the rajshahi and rangpur divisions the barind tract occupies about 8720 km2 while the teesta floodplain inhabits about 2071 km2 faisal et al 2005 mondal and islam 2017 most of the barind tract lands are high to medium high lands whereas most of the teesta floodplain lands are medium high to medium lowlands high land is considered to be above the normal flood level a flood whose inundation area exceeds 21 of the total land of the country while medium highland and medium lowlands are commonly flooded between 90 and 180 cm deep during the flood season mirza 2002 non calcareous grey floodplain and non calcareous brown floodplain soils are the predominant soil types on the teesta floodplain whereas the deep red brown terrace soil and deep grey terrace soils are the major components of the barind tract soils bangladesh bureau of statistics 2019 the temporal distribution of rainfall temperature humidity and wind speed in this region can be characterised into pre monsoon march may monsoon june september post monsoon october november and winter december february seasons 2 2 data 2 2 1 climatic data forty years 1979 2018 of daily rainfall and temperature data for the teesta floodplain rangpur and dinajpur weather stations and the barind tract bogra and rajshahi weather stations regions are obtained from the bangladesh meteorological department bmd fig 1 2 2 2 yield data the production of different types of rice data boro aus aman for the study area was obtained from the bangladesh bureau of statistics bbs boro rice is cultivated during the winter season thus it highly depends on irrigation shahid 2011 in contrast aus and aman rice are cultivated from march to june and june july to october november respectively mainuddin et al 2021 aus rice cultivation depends on pre monsoon rainfall while aman rice cultivation depends on monsoonal rainfall ghose et al 2021 mainuddin et al 2021 2 2 3 missing data and data infilling methods a small number of missing data days are infilled prior to analysis table 1 of the four sites three sites have less than 0 59 of days of missing data across all months in the study period most months have no missing data over the full period one site rangpur has 2 56 of days in july august and september missing and smaller proportions of data missing in april and december in this study missing data for a specific day for a given station is infilled by the average of the nearest two stations for that day the infilled data are then visually examined using boxplots to identify any potential outliers with none being found the small proportion of missing data is therefore deemed not to influence the results significantly 2 2 4 time series analysis of rainfall the boxplot in fig 2 shows the total monthly rainfall distribution at meteorological stations of the barind tract and teesta floodplain the probability distributions pdf of rainfall at annual seasonal and daily time step are shown in supplementary figs 3 4 and 5 results show that the annual pdf for all regions portray a symmetric or bell shape pattern which indicates the normal distribution of the data on the other hand for seasonal pdfs we can see a positively skewed and asymmetric distribution in winter and post monsoon season while symmetric or normal distribution exists in pre monsoon and monsoon season for the daily pdfs we can see that for all seasons and regions an asymmetric distribution exists for rainfall overall we can say that for annual pre monsoon and monsoon seasons any kind of symmetric distribution is suitable for analysis while for winter post monsoon and daily rainfall any kind of asymmetric distribution or positively skewed distribution is fit for analysis autocorrelation functions for the different observations are shown in supplementary fig 6 we find no serial correlation or autocorrelation among the data which indicate that data has no specific pattern and series are absolutely random and will not hamper our analysis 2 3 analytical techniques 2 3 1 identification of drought occurrences using edi edi is based on the concept of daily effective precipitation ep byun and wilhite 1999 ep is the summed precipitation p which is a time dependant reduction function based on the current and antecedent rainfall with time deo et al 2017 kamruzzaman et al 2019b if pm is the daily rainfalls and n is the preceding period then ep for the current day can be calculated as deo et al 2017 kamruzzaman et al 2019b 1 ep n 1 i m 1 n p m n p 1 p 1 p 2 2 p 1 p 2 p 3 3 p 1 p 2 p 365 365 p 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 365 p 2 1 2 1 3 1 365 p 365 1 365 where i is the duration of summation we use 365 as the initial i value which is the annual precipitation cycle and can be used as a characteristics value of the total water resources available or stored for a long period byun and wilhite 1999 in this study the daily eps for each day from jan 1 1979 to dec 31 2018 and the climatological mean ep mep for each calendar day i e from 1 to 365 are calculated for 40 years 1979 2018 for example the mep for the 1st of january is the mean of 40 values for the 1st day of january composed of over 40 years kamruzzaman et al 2019b then the deviation of the ep dep from the mep is calculated as 2 dep ep mep a negative dep indicates the deficiency of water resources for a particular day while a positive value of dep indicates a surplus of water resources finally the edi is calculated as 3 edi dep st dep where st dep is the standard deviation of each day s dep however for a dry period longer than 365 days we recalculate the ep and edi again by increasing the value of i in eq 1 as the number of dry days increases for instance if the negative dep value continues for 2 days i is set to be 365 2 1 366 byun and wilhite 1999 kamruzzaman et al 2019b jain et al 2015 therefore the accumulated impact of drought on soil that occurred several years ago 365 days is also reflected in the edi jain et al 2015 the seasonal and annual edi is also calculated using eq 4 where q m is the rainfall m 1 months before the current month and n is the duration of the preceding period then the ep for the current month is calculated as smakhtin and hughes 2007 4 ep n 1 j m 1 n q m n j is the summation of the duration i e the number of months for example if n 4 then 5 ep p 1 p 1 p 2 2 p 1 p 2 p 3 3 p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 4 where p 1 p 2 p 3 and p 4 are precipitation values during the current month the previous month 2 months before and 3 months before respectively smakhtin and hughes 2007 the drought severity is classified and shown in table 2 2 3 2 estimation of drought severity and duration onset and ending the severity of drought ds and peak drought intensity pdi are computed deo et al 2017 as 6 ds k 1 n edi k 0 7 pdi min edi dd where k is the date after the onset of negative edi value edi k is the continuous days with negative edi value during the drought dd period a drought period is the cumulative number of days with continuous negative edi values starting from the day with the onset of negative edi to the last day with negative edi value the annual total of negative edi values in a year which is termed as the accumulated edi aedi is used to calculate the annual severity of the drought the chronological annual dryness and intensity are computed using yeadi365 and yeadind kim et al 2009 yaedi365 is the sum of negative edi divided by 365 days which indicates the annual dryness of an area in contrast the yeadind is the sum of negative edi divided by the total number of days of negative edis which indicates the annual intensity of drought if yeadi365 is equal to yeadind for a particular year it means drought conditions existed over the whole year kim et al 2009 8 yeadi 365 sum of negative edi 365 9 yeadi nd sum of negative edi total number of days of negative edi 10 sum of negative edi k 1 365 edi k 0 in this study based on the drought duration and the peak drought intensity values the top 20 cases of the highest drought spell are identified and analysed 2 3 3 identification of the consecutive drought spells in this study a drought episode that exists for more than 3 months 90 days is considered a long term drought spell while a consecutive dry period that lasts for more than 1 month 30 days and less than 3 months 90 days is considered as a medium term drought spell a drought spell that lasts for more than 1 week 7 days but less than 1 month 30 days is considered as a short term drought spell 2 3 4 estimation of the drought frequency the frequency of daily drought per year dfy for edi 0 and edi 1 over 1979 2018 is analysed by using the following equation zhao et al 2018 11 df y total number of drought days in the year total number of days in the year 100 moreover we analyse the drought frequency for different months and different starting and ending periods for example for the drought period starting in january and ending in june the 6 month edi frequency is calculated in the same way for the winter season beginning in december and ending in february the 3 month drought frequency is computed thus for any drought period dfp starting and ending between january to december monthly to 12 month drought frequencies are calculated as 12 df p total number of edi negative days in the month period over 1979 2018 total number of days in the month period over 1979 2018 100 2 3 5 analysis of the pattern of meteorological drought the pattern of drought over the 1979 2018 period is analysed using the mann kendall mk test and sen slope estimation hamed 2008 neeti and eastman 2011 sen 1968 yürekli 2015 to find out whether the median slope is statistically different than zero we calculated the confidence interval of the time slope gilbert 1987 gocic and trajkovic 2013 hollander et al 2014 moreover we calculated the upper and lower limit of the slope the slope is statistically different from zero when the upper and lower limits of the slope have the same sign gocic and trajkovic 2013 2 3 6 evaluation of the edi performance drought is a seldom studied hazard in bangladesh and very few studies have been conducted on the monitoring and prediction of droughts by the government or non government organisations in bangladesh brammer 1987 miyan 2015 rahaman et al 2016 the drought history and drought related records are not well documented kamruzzaman et al 2019b only brief discussions of crop damages and production losses are found in some reports published by the bangladesh bureau of statistics bbs thus it is difficult to identify and recognise a drought year based on bbs reports only hence in addition to bbs results we cross checked our results with existing peer reviewed published sources conducted in the study area selvaraju and baas 2007 rafiuddin et al 2011 alamgir et al 2015 mondol et al 2016 rahman and lateh 2016 nury and hasan 2016 mamun et al 2018 kamruzzaman et al 2019a 2019b since the study area is also prone to floods and agricultural production is understood to be low during years with flood conditions this study computed correlations between the edi and agricultural production in non flood years edi 0 99 only to evaluate the performance of edi values we also performed index to index evaluation and compared the edi results with the standardised precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 for this evaluation we conducted pearson correlation r and co efficient of determination r2 between edi and spi for different seasons and annual scale moreover we performed detrending of the rice productions and evaluated the anomaly of detrended rice productions with mean detrended rice productions and edi finally we plotted the spi and edi data in quantile quantile q q plots to determine the extent to which the edi and spi share a common probability distribution 3 results 3 1 daily drought occurrence figs 3 and 4 shows the daily drought occurrences in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain regions based on edi values and drought severity classification the results show substantial inter annual variability in drought over time in both regions in most years the first 100 120 days of the calendar year experience mild drought with some moderate drought in this period drought conditions tend to increase from march to may although there is high variability in the drought severity during this period april and may days 91 151 have the highest number of drought days across the whole period though mid june to september days 166 273 is the monsoon time some dry spells are found in this period with some severe drought conditions in 1983 1992 1994 95 1996 2006 2009 10 2012 13 2014 and 2018 during october november the number of drought days has increased after 2008 overall the number of drought days and drought occurrences are higher in the barind tract than in the teesta floodplain 3 2 seasonal to annual drought occurrence seasonal and annual occurrences of drought throughout 1979 2018 are shown in fig 5 the study area faces mild to moderate drought conditions during the winter period the pre monsoon season is the most drought prone season in north bengal of bangladesh when the barind tract and the teesta floodplain experiences all severe categories of drought analysis indicates that the study area frequently experiences drought conditions between 1991 and 1997 including an extreme drought condition during 1994 1995 in addition these two areas also suffer from severe to extreme drought in 1979 1982 1995 and 2012 different locations in the study area are hit by moderate to severe drought in 1981 1986 1989 1992 1996 2007 2010 and 2014 the monsoon drought is found to be increasing in both the barind tract and the teesta floodplain fig 5 extreme droughts hit the teesta floodplain during the growing seasons in 1994 and 2018 while severe droughts hit the barind tract in 1982 2010 2016 and 2018 recent decades show an increase in drought during the monsoon periods overall the frequency and severity of monsoon drought have increased throughout 1979 2018 the post monsoon drought is also found increasing fig 5 annual edi analysis finds that over 1979 2018 at least two severe to extreme droughts hit the teesta floodplain while three severe to the extreme and six moderates to severe droughts hit the barind tract the results suggest that the annual drought severity has also increased and the north bengal experiences dry conditions once every 2 to 3 years 3 3 chronological annual dryness fig 6 shows the chronological annual dryness the result indicates that in the teesta floodplain the intensity yaedi nd and annual dryness yaedi 365 are both high in 1994 1995 and 2018 in comparison to other years while similar conditions prevail in the barind tract in 1982 1992 2006 and 2010 however the intensity is found higher than 1 5 during the years of 1979 1982 1992 1994 95 2006 2014 and 2018 than in other years for both regions it indicates that there is a prolonged dry period in those years the chronological annual dryness results also suggest that the intensity and annual dryness are higher in the barind tract than in the teesta floodplain 3 4 indexing drought severity the drought severity index is constructed to understand whether the annual severity of drought shows consistency in consecutive years fig 7 fig 7 a shows that the highest severity of drought occurs in 2010 in the barind tract when the total negative edi exceeds 400 in contrast the teesta floodplain reaches the peak of drought severity in 1994 95 and the total negative edi is about 650 during 2009 11 the drought lasts for about 570 days in the barind tract while in 1994 95 a prolonged drought condition exists for more than 387 days in the teesta floodplain the other notable years for severe annual droughts in the barind tract are 1982 1992 2006 2009 2012 2013 and 2018 while the remarkable severe drought severity years in the teesta floodplain are 1979 1981 2001 2006 2014 and 2018 the total number of dry days increases significantly in recent decades compared to the first decades of the 1979 2018 period fig 7 b the highest number of total dry days and the peak drought intensity takes place in the year 2010 in the barind tract severe peak drought intensity is prevalent in 1979 and 1989 in this area severe to extreme peak in drought intensity occurs in the teesta floodplain in 1979 1994 1995 and 2014 the peak intensity is found low during 1984 1988 and 1998 2005 periods in both the areas fig 7 c the results indicate that the study area suffers from severe to extreme drought on average once every 10 years fig 8 shows the seasonal total dry days for different seasons in the study area which indicate that the total dry days are increasing day by day in recent decades and the increase is significant in the winter and post monsoon seasons for both areas and in the monsoon season for the teesta floodplain region 3 5 frequency of drought the highest drought frequency about 76 of days of the year is found in 2010 in the barind tract whereas this condition prevails in the teesta floodplain in 1994 when edi less than 1 exists for more than half a year fig 9 the frequency and magnitude of drought are also high during these 2 years during the first 20 years of the 1979 2018 period the frequency of daily drought conditions is higher in 1979 1982 83 1989 1992 and 1994 95 than in other years while in the recent 20 years the frequency of daily drought conditions is higher in 2001 2006 2009 10 2013 2014 2016 and 2018 in the teesta floodplain the days with edi less than 1 occur in 1979 1981 1989 1994 1995 2001 2006 2014 2017 and 2018 however the frequency of drought is relatively low in 1983 1986 and 2002 2005 in general the frequency of moderate to severe droughts is increasing significantly in the barind tract fig 9 the frequencies of drought in different starting and ending months from 1 month to 12 months are shown in fig 10 the results suggest that meteorological drought is mainly seasonal and occurs more in pre monsoon and post monsoon the drought frequency is higher in the barind tract than in the teesta floodplain fig 10 the results also indicate that the percent of drought frequency has increased in the recent half of the study periods 1999 2018 than in the first half 1979 1998 we find that during the periods of 1979 1998 the highest frequency of drought existed mainly in pre monsoon while during the 1999 2018 periods drought has increased in the post monsoon time while the frequency of mild drought is increasing in the teesta floodplain the moderate to severe drought frequency is increasing in the barind tract the drought frequency has increased by at least 10 in north bengal over 1979 2018 3 6 consecutive drought spells onset and ending of drought the consecutive drought spells in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain region are shown in fig 11 the results indicate that about 27 long dry spells 90 days exist in the teesta floodplain while about 17 long dry spells 90 days are found in the barind tract however drought spells that last for more than 1 month but less than 3 months and more than 1 week but less than 1 month are found more in the barind tract than the teesta floodplain the top 20 drought cases are shown in table 3 based on the duration and peak drought value the results indicate that the highest prolonged duration of the drought is from the mid of june 1994 to the first week of july 1995 in the teesta floodplain while in the barind tract the longest drought spell exists from the end of september 2009 to mid april 2011 during this time negative edi reaches the highest peak at 2 21 in the teesta floodplain and 2 50 in the barind tract regions though the number of consecutive long term drought spells are fewer in the barind tract than in the teesta floodplain the duration of the droughts is longer in the barind tract moreover the peak drought values are also higher in the barind tract than in the teesta floodplain 3 7 the pattern of seasonal drought the results show that the seasonal and annual edi values exhibit a decreasing pattern during all seasons except the pre monsoon period based on the mann kendall test and sen slope estimation in both the barind tract and the teesta floodplain table 4 the highest overall decreasing pattern in seasonal edi is found in the monsoon period in both regions at the same time the barind tract has a higher decrease at the annual scale relative to the teesta floodplain at a 5 level of significance a decrease of edi is found in monsoon and at the annual scale in both the barind tract and the teesta floodplain we find an increasing trend of seasonal edi during pre monsoon in the teesta floodplain which is not significant at a 5 level of significance overall the decreasing pattern of edi is more evident in the barind tract than in the teesta floodplain if these trends continue drought conditions may further exacerbate in the coming years 3 8 evaluation of edi and edi rice production relationship historical records of drought derived from different sources and reports are shown in table 6 which indicate that during the 1979 2018 period droughts occurred in the years 1979 1981 1982 1989 1992 1994 1995 2001 2006 2009 2010 2012 2014 and 2018 these results are in line with our results though agricultural production is significantly increasing year by year fig 12 the drought conditions and agricultural production over 1979 2018 indicate a negative relationship table 5 figs 12 and 13 in addition we find a positive relationship between detrended rice productions and edi only for few years fig 12 overall we did not find any significant relationships among the edis and rice production in the study region which might be related to the uncertainty in the spatial and temporal distributions of the droughts with precipitation alone accounts for the edi does not consider the effects of irrigation and other water sources thus we analyse the performance of edi with spi which is closely related to soil moisture fig 14 shows the q q plot with a coefficient r and the coefficient of determination r between edi and spi the results indicate that edi is strongly correlated with spi which reveals that edi can effectively measure meteorological drought 4 discussion this paper assessed the characteristics of meteorological drought occurrence and severity in two important agro ecological zones namely the barind tract and the teesta floodplain in north bengal bangladesh using edi at different timescales the analysis and results of our study indicate that the patterns of drought variability are significantly different in both short term and long term periods it is evident that the northern and north western part of the country experiences persistent mild to moderate meteorological drought over the winter periods and the severity of meteorological drought is high during pre monsoon and post monsoon figs 3 10 this result is in line with previous studies habiba et al 2014 the number of dry days is increasing based on daily edi analysis while in pre monsoon a non significant decreasing trend is observed in the drought severity frequency and variability in both the barind tract and the teesta floodplain based on seasonal edi figs 3 5 table 4 bangladesh receives two thirds of the annual rainfall in the monsoon ahmed and kim 2003 shahid and khairulmaini 2009 our analysis indicates that the monsoon drought is significantly increasing table 4 the overall severity of the drought has also increased over the period 1979 2018 fig 7 other studies have also equally noted this increasing pattern of drought severity frequency and variability in north bengal alamgir et al 2015 kamruzzaman et al 2019a miyan 2015 mohsenipour et al 2018 mondol et al 2017 2016 the chronology of drought indicates that the annual intensity and dryness are increasing in both areas these results are also in line with other studies habiba et al 2014 kamruzzaman et al 2018 the increasing trend of drought severity for a longer overall timespan of the dataset is important since extreme drought events almost always lead to the loss of agricultural production as observed in many other studies the future change of drought variability is projected to be more crucial and significant especially in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain bari et al 2016 hasan et al 2018 miah et al 2017 mondol et al 2018 nury et al 2017 mohammad atiqur rahman et al 2017 rahman and lateh 2016 ruane et al 2013 mainly because drought represents a non linear combination of numerous meteorological and land surface variables including precipitation temperature wind speed radiation humidity and soil moisture the analysis of climatic variability the trends of rainfall and temperature in the study area indicate that except pre monsoon and post monsoon in the teesta floodplain the long term average rainfall during winter monsoon and annual rainfall for the last 40 years have a decreasing trend fig 15 besides the mean maximum temperature in winter of barind tract regions and pre monsoon of both areas the long term yearly mean maximum and minimum temperature in all other seasons and annual scale have increased fig 15 these findings are similar to those from other studies ahasan et al 1970 basher et al 2018 islam 2009 mondol et al 2018 mullick et al 2019 nury and hasan 2016 md abiar rahman et al 2017 rahman et al 2012 rahman and lateh 2016 syed and al amin 2016 ahmed and kim 2003 since the precipitation deficit is the main driver of meteorological droughts it is expected that the deficit in future precipitation would bring more droughts kamruzzaman et al 2018 however changes in rainfall variability may impact differently high variability of rainfall is observed in the study area in terms of amount and spatiotemporal distributions fig 15 subsequently it has resulted in frequent drought episodes with varying intensities both in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain fig 11 kamruzzaman et al 2018 also indicate that the probability of annual occurrences frequency and percentage of extreme drought occurrence has increased in recent decades in north western parts compare to other parts of the study area the agricultural drought is also projected to high risk in northern districts while high crop production and dependent on irrigation made agriculture at higher risk and vulnerable to drought than other areas of the country kamruzzaman et al 2018 moreover the relevance of the water scarcity problem is pointed out in several pieces of literature indicating that north bengal is more vulnerable to drought basher et al 2018 islam 2009 habiba et al 2014 mondol et al 2018 mullick et al 2019 nury and hasan 2016 rahman et al 2012 rahman and lateh 2016 shahid and behrawan 2008 syed and al amin 2016 drought duration is one of the key elements of drought characteristics huang et al 2019 zargar et al 2011 it is the interval between the onset and ending time of a drought which can vary from months to years in this study we have calculated and analysed the onset and end of droughts in the study area as edi calculation is performed on a daily basis it provides accurate drought information not only for well defined prolonged widespread and intensive droughts but also for very localised and short term droughts byun and wilhite 1999 deo et al 2017 kamruzzaman et al 2019b our results indicate that the onset and end time of droughts in the study area mostly follow the monsoonal rainfall pattern in decades prior to the late 2000s a drought spell typically starts between march to may 15 days and ends with the monsoonal rainfall in june july figs 3 4 in the years since the last 2000s winter and post monsoon droughts days have significantly increased in north bengal fig 8 the highest duration of drought is found in the year 1994 1995 in the teesta floodplain when people suffer from a massive loss of agricultural production especially rice and jute production paul 1995 kamruzzaman et al 2019b the historical drought data of bangladesh indicate that consecutive drought during 1978 79 caused a reduction of 2 million tons of crops followed by a loss of about 0 44 million tons of rice production due to the drought during 1980 81 bbs 1982 during the 1983 84 and 1984 1985 periods a loss of about 0 59 and 1 32 million tons of rice production occurred due to drought conditions bbs 1986 the 1994 1995 drought condition was very severe from which a reduction of at least 3 5 million tons of rice and wheat production was resulted paul 1995 rahman and biswas 1995 about 25 30 reduction of average crop production happened in 2006 because of drought moreover about 5 74 of the damages and losses related to agriculture products and infrastructure were caused by drought between 2009 and 2014 kamruzzaman et al 2019b 2019a in contrast to the observed drought characteristic and existing agricultural productions data of the study area we find that edi and rice production has no strong correlation the moving decadal correlations between edi and different types of rice show that edi is only positively correlated with aman rice during the first eleven moving decades whereas for boro rice edi is positively correlated only during 1982 1995 fig 13 aus rice is found to have a moving decadal correlation with edi in a few years almost no consecutive decadal correlation is found moreover we find no strong correlation between detrended rice productions and edi edi did not successfully account for agricultural losses in north bengal this result is in line with the study of brammer 2016 thus this analysis indicates that the impacts of meteorological drought on agriculture in the study area could be compensated by other factors such as irrigation agricultural management a number of adaptive measures have been recommended to cope with the adverse effect of climatic events impacting agricultural production over the decades in the study area examples include crop replacement irrigation gap filling and inter cropping of local food crop setting up of deep tube wells and ponds for irrigation planting drought tolerant and cultivating short duration crop varieties agronomic management crop intensification and increased use of technology to reduce climate vulnerabilities to climate change ahmed and chowdhury 2006 fao 2006 habiba et al 2012 mainuddin et al 2015 paul 1998 rawlani and sovacool 2011 the irrigation facilities electricity connections high yield varieties and supply of fertiliser have increased remarkably in bangladesh in recent decades bbs 1979 2019 in addition the farakka and teesta dams in the upper stream on the river ganges and the river teesta respectively have a significant impact on agricultural production in north bengal shahid and behrawan 2008 according to afroz and rahman 2013 more than 80 of the water reduced from ganges and teesta rivers due to the construction of the barrage miyan 2015 moreover compound changes in other physical and agronomical factors influencing crop growth would complicate the assessment of yield response to droughts muller et al 2018 seifert and lobell 2015 stewart et al 2005 there are existing significant uncertainties in crop yield simulations in model based studies due to our limited understanding and knowledge of the physical and agronomical process regarding crop growth and yield asseng et al 2011 elliott et al 2015 folberth et al 2016 leng and hall 2019 rosenzweig et al 2014 the research conducted by li et al 2015 indicated that the complete crop failure for rainfed rice over south asia is decreasing and there would not have significant drought impacts on rainfed rice they pointed out that climate change could benefit rainfed rice production in south asia if the rainfed rice season would be adjusted accordingly li et al 2015 a study conducted by gain and giupponi 2015 also indicated that the majority of the yield variations could not be explained by the drought index and the occurrence of a drought event may not necessarily lead to a reduction of yield confirming the importance of re assessing the drought impacts in a probabilistic manner using more agro climatic and technological data the integrated assessment of water scarcity risk is an urgent need in water resources management biswas 2004 gain and giupponi 2015 however we assessed the edi results with the spi index and historical drought data of bangladesh spi is an established drought model and uses to detect meteorological drought in many countries like bangladesh the edi and spi relationship indicate a strong correlation between them while we find no strong correlation between spi and rice productions supplementary fig 7 in contrast the edi results matched the historical drought data table 6 thus edi can successfully characterise the meteorological drought but not account for agricultural losses or productions of the study area 5 limitations of the study effective drought index edi is only based on rainfall data and require daily data in addition the value of i is not well established thus difficult to consider the summation of the rainfall duration moreover drought is also depending on other factors which are not considered in the present study 6 conclusions and recommendations in this study we characterised the meteorological drought occurrence and severity in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain using edi moreover we evaluated the use of edi and its correlation with rice production in the study area the results and findings suggest that droughts in the study area are increasing the consecutive drought spells onset and ending of drought indicate that drought occurs mainly on a seasonal basis with most droughts lasting between 1 and 3 months in the study area overall the peak drought value and the intensity of consecutive drought spells and the seasonal and annual dryness are higher in the barind tract than in the teesta floodplain the annual severity of drought shows consistency with consecutive drought severity notably the pattern of the severity of the meteorological drought is found to increase in addition the increasing patterns of meteorological drought during the monsoon period and at the annual scale are significant both in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain this region suffers dry conditions once every 2 to 3 years and is affected by at least one severe drought every 10 years however our results suggest that the meteorological drought impact on rice production in north bengal has been much less significant than it has been generally assumed to have important implications for national drought and agricultural planning observed drought analysis spi and historical drought data have a good match while possibly due to technological interventions in recent decades rice production is not sensitive to meteorological drought a large portion of yield variation cannot be explained by the drought index since several other factors influencing yield are not considered to summarise we conclude that the severity and frequency of meteorological drought are increasing whereas the trend of rice production is decoupled from that of meteorological drought however we do not know if the technological progress is going to continue but it is important to highlight that the increase in meteorological drought means there would be potentially more challenges in the future if this trend continues moreover these conditions may introduce new dependencies into the small scale agricultural production namely the reliable and affordable provision of fuel and or electric power confirming the importance of re assessing the drought impacts on the potential practical water resources planning and management in the study area using more agro climatic and technological data hence in a new paper the prospect of technological drought when fuel or power are limiting as a new risk factor will be examined and evaluated declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they
