12930,inspired by the development of adsorption techniques an adsorbent for ammonium nh4 n removal featuring high selectivity towards nh4 n high adsorption capacity simplicity of use low cost and environmental friendliness have attracted great attention in recent years during this work a natural zeolite with a lower nsi nal ratio of 4 2 was selected as the modified substrate various modification agents including naoh succinic acid sa and nacl were performed to modify the zeolites successively due to succinic acid assisted modification plenty of carboxylate groups were distributed on the surface of zeolite as active adsorption sites the modified zeolite cmz shows a significant nh4 n adsorption capacity which is much higher 10 fold than that of natural zeolites moreover cmz also shows high selectivity for nh4 n among several cations including na ca2 and mg2 the nh4 n adsorption kinetics and isotherms of cmz fit the pseudo first order and langmuir model confirming a chemical monolayer adsorption process after ten regeneration times cmz maintained the high nh4 n adsorption capacity of around 14 55 mg g 1 showing outstanding stability and reusability when reused for water treatment in addition a modified porous zeolite pellet mpzp was further prepared mpzp holds a relatively lower wear rate of 0 1 at the continuous flow rate of 50 bv h 1 suggesting high flushing resistance and long service life graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords natural zeolite succinic acid modification ammonium nitrogen adsorption 1 introduction ammonium nh4 n is the most frequent form of nitrogen contamination in wastewaters nh4 n contaminants stem from municipal sewage industrial wastewater agricultural wastes and other sources 1 2 if not handled properly this pollutant is readily introduced into surface water and groundwater resources resulting in a damaging impact on the ecological environment and human health for example the discharge of untreated nitrogen loading wastewaters into the natural water environment will lead to toxic algal blooms which can contribute to hypoxia zones fish kills and poor drinking water quality 3 4 in particular the nitrates and nitrites generated from the oxidation of nh4 n compounds pose a significant risk to human health 5 numerous available technologies for nh4 n removal including biological degradation physical and chemical adsorption have been previously reported 6 10 compared with conventional ways the ion exchange method is widely recognized as a promising technique owing to favorable characteristics such as high selectivity towards nh4 n high adsorption capacity simplicity of use low cost and environmental friendliness 11 among various absorbents the ion exchange resin has been thought of as an effective adsorption material for nh4 n removal because of its safety efficiency and high ion exchange capacity 12 nevertheless its high price short service life and environmental pollution caused by incineration after being abandoned make it less feasible in large scale applications some adsorbents such as activated carbon biochar bentonite and other clay materials have also been reported for the removal of nh4 n 13 16 however due to the low adsorption capacity high service cost no regeneration or difficulty in operation these materials are limited in industrial application zeolite is an alkali metal aluminosilicate with a crystal structure composed of silicon and aluminum tetrahedra 17 the extensive internal pores and interconnected channels result in a large specific surface area to provide enough adsorption sites which are occupied by alkali metal ions for ion exchange with nh4 n 18 20 theoretically the nsi nal ratio of the natural zeolite determines the ion exchange capacity a lower nsi nal ratio implies that more cations are bound onto the zeolite framework which is helpful for increasing the ion exchange capacity natural zeolites around the world with the nsi nal ratio between 4 4 and 6 3 3 7 8 10 18 24 53 54 have a relatively lower ion exchange capacity to improve the relatively low ion exchange capacity natural zeolite is usually physically or chemically modified by the alkali metal ions with a stronger ion exchange capability such as na 21 several studies have been reported on zeolites which were modified by nacl naoh or nano3 to improve the nh4 n absorption capacity 22 24 however it is also believed that the active sites for ion exchange could not be fully revealed via a single modification treatment the development of a facile and proper modification method for further enhancement of the nh4 n absorption capacity of zeolites remains extremely challenging and is demanded in this contribution nacl succinic acid and naoh were all employed as modification agents to clear the blockage in the pores and improve the potential of zeolite surface succinic acid was utilized for providing carboxyl groups as additional active adsorption sites a natural zeolite from china s hebei province with a lower nsi nal ratio of 4 2 was chosen for modification the batch adsorption behaviors of obtained samples denoted as cmz including the kinetics and isotherm were further investigated to realize the efficient separation of adsorbents from treated water during the adsorption process a fixed bed continuous flow column was employed for adsorption and regeneration in comparison with natural zeolites cmz exhibits a prominent nh4 n absorption capacity at a large size 1 3 mm finally to prolong service life with high hardness a modified porous zeolite pellet mpzp based on cmz was prepared these studies demonstrate that both cmz and mpzp hold great potential for practical applications in nh4 n removal from wastewater via fixed bed continuous flow column 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials natural zeolites nz particle size 1 3 mm employed were purchased from hebei province china and the chemical composition is illustrated in table 1 before experiments nz was washed and dried at 100 c chemicals used during the experiments including sodium hydroxide sodium chloride succinic acid and ammonium chloride were analytical grade and purchased from the sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china deionized water was used throughout the experiment municipal effluent containing nh4 n and organic pollutants was supplied by hangzhou shangtuo environmental technology co ltd 2 2 multiple step modification of nz the multiple step modified zeolite cmz was prepared as follows 3 g nz was added into 100 ml of 4 wt naoh aqueous solution and stirred at 95 c for 5 h the treated zeolite was filtered washed until neutral and then dried at 100 c to afford naoh modified zeolite z naoh subsequently z naoh was placed in 100 ml of 3 wt succinic acid aqueous solution this mixture was maintained at 25 c and shaken at 150 rpm for 6 h in a thermostatic shaker thz 82 changzhou guohua electric appliance co ltd china after filtration solid particles were washed and dried again to yield a two step modified zeolite z naoh pa finally z naoh pa was placed into 100 ml of 30 wt nacl aqueous solution and stirred at room temperature for 6 h thereafter filtered particles were rinsed and then dried to obtain cmz z naoh pa nacl 2 3 preparation of modified porous zeolite pellet cmz was crushed and passed through an 80 meshes sieve to generate cmz powders then the cmz powders were mixed with the mixed additives at a ratio of 84 16 after adding some water the mixture was extruded and pelletized to clay pellets the clay pellets were dried at 100 c for 2 h and further calcined in a muffle furnace at 550 c for 2 h to obtain modified porous zeolite pellets mpzp with 3 mm particle size 2 4 characterization mineralogical compositions of samples were examined using x ray powder diffraction pxrd measurements bruker d8 advance x ray powder diffractometer pxrd patterns were recorded using ni filtered cu kα radiation at 40 kv and 40 ma in the 2θ range of 5 80 with a step length of 0 04 structural changes were determined by a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrophotometer thermo scientific nicolet is50 the ftir spectrum was recorded in the frequency ranging from 400 to 4000 cm 1 cmz s surface and mpzp s cross section morphologies and element contents were observed by scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds zeiss supratm 55 before observation all samples were placed in a vacuum chamber and sputter coated with a layer of gold for 15 s the n2 adsorption brunauer emmett teller bet method was employed to determine the surface area and pore size distribution using a micromeritics instrument micromeritics asap 2460 the pore size distribution curves were calculated using the barrett joyner halenda algorithm 2 5 batch adsorption studies the sample was placed into a flask with nh4 n aqueous solution thereafter the flask was placed in a thermostatic shaker agitating at 130 rpm at 25 c then the solution was filtered and the concentration of nh4 n in the filtrate was measured the capacity and removal rate were determined by the following equations 1 removal c 0 c t c 0 100 2 q t c 0 c t v m 3 q e c 0 c e v m where c0 ct and ce are initial final nh4 n concentration at time t and equilibrium time mg l 1 respectively qt and qe are the amount of nh4 n adsorbed at time t and equilibrium time respectively mg g 1 v is the volume of solution l and m is the mass of the adsorbent g the effect of solution ph on nh4 n removal was studied by changing the ph value from 4 to 10 and the effect of cmz s dosage was evaluated by varying dosage from 3 to 20 g l 1 moreover the interference of the coexisting ions on nh4 n removal was studied via adding three cations na ca2 and mg2 into nh4 n aqueous solution with the same concentration of 50 mg l 1 kinetic studies were investigated by adding zeolite into 50 mg l 1 nh4 n aqueous solution solution was collected at different contact times for the aid of a membrane filter furthermore equilibrium isotherm studies were carried out by placing samples into 100 ml of 50 mg l 1 nh4 n aqueous solution by varying adsorbent dosages from 1 to 20 g l 1 to achieve sorption equilibrium all the experiments were repeated twice 2 6 column adsorption fixed bed continuous flow column adsorption experiments involving ten successive adsorption and desorption cycles were performed with a glass column diameter of 2 5 cm height of 28 cm with a packed bed volume of 120 ml the column was firstly packed with the zeolite then saturated with nh4 n by pumping synthetic nh4cl aqueous solution downward at a flow rate of 5 bed volumes bv h 1 adsorption saturated zeolite was then regenerated by flowing nacl aqueous solution upward for 4 h at the flow rate of 8 bv h 1 the nh4 n concentrations in the eluate and the regeneration solution were measured to analyze quantities of nh4 n adsorbed or desorbed the same experiments were performed for mpzp a schematic of the column adsorption and regeneration experiment is shown in fig 1 fixed bed continuous flow column adsorption experiments for a municipal effluent containing nh4 n and organic pollutants were also carried out in the glass column the column height 30 cm inner diameter 2 5 cm was first packed with zeolites volume 120 ml then the municipal effluent was pumped downwards at the flow rate of 5 bv h 1 the concentrations of nh4 n chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod5 and dissolved organic carbon doc in inlet and outlet of the column after 24 hour operation were analyzed 2 7 flushing experiments flushing experiments were conducted in a glass column packed with mpzp nh4cl aqueous solution was firstly pumped from the top of the column for 1 h at different flow rates 10 150 bv h 1 then nacl aqueous solution was pumped upward for 1 h at the same rate after the flushing mpzp were taken out dried and weighed wear rates at different flow rates were calculated as follow wear rate lost mass initial mass same experiments were performed for cmz 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization fig 2a illustrates the ftir spectrum of nz cmz and succinic acid cmz still maintains the fundamental structure and exhibits significant vibration characteristics of nz typically peaks of nz and cmz at 3700 3200 cm 1 1636 cm 1 1067 cm 1 779 cm 1 605 601 cm 1 and 458 cm 1 are assigned to υo h δo h υsi o υal o υsio4 and υalo4 respectively 25 27 the peak intensity at 1636 cm 1 of cmz shows an obvious decrease in comparison with that of nz owing to the loss of crystallized water which could bring about more pore structure and then improve the nh4 n adsorption performance of zeolite 26 in addition υc o and δc h observed at 1690 cm 1 and 1308 cm 1 indicate that carboxylate groups are distributed on the surface of cmz after pa modification compared with the ftir spectrum of succinic acid the absence of υo h at 3500 2500 cm 1 and δo h at 916 cm 1 of cmz suggests that succinic acids covalently bond to the surface of cmz the pxrd patterns of nz and cmz shown in fig 2b indicate that the main components in nz were clinoptilolite ca c kna2ca2 si29al7 o72 24h2o heulandite ca h ca3 6k0 8al8 8si27 4o72 26 1h2o and quartz q sio2 from the pxrd diffractogram both nz and cmz exhibit similar spectral lines within the variety of diffraction peaks suggesting the overall skeletal structural integrity of zeolite before and after modification 22 28 30 however compared to nz cmz show a slight reduction within the intensity of clinoptilolite ca and heulandite diffraction peaks which could be attributed to the partial dissolution of clinoptilolite ca after naoh treatment and the ion exchange behavior of na with ca2 on the heulandite after nacl modification 26 31 32 besides cmz after nh4 n adsorption displayed no appreciable change in the pxrd patterns suggesting that the ion exchange process has few influences on the crystalline structure of cmz bet results of nz and cmz are illustrated in fig 2c d and table 2 the hysteresis loops appearing in a relative pressure ranging from 0 4 to 1 0 confirm mesopores within the zeolite it is noted that the specific surface area of cmz is significantly higher than that of nz additionally after multiple step modification of the nz a great enhancement within total pore volume and the drop of average pore width indicates that a large number of mesopores come into being in cmz as proved previously naoh and nacl cleared the pore channels and voids of nz inducing the formation of numerous microporous and mesoporous structures 33 34 furthermore the decrease in pore size of cmz was presumably due to the generation of much smaller mesopores and aggregation of pa molecules on channels and the external surface of cmz 35 to assess the surface morphology change of nz before and after modification and to evaluate the chemical modification effect sem images of nz and cmz were acquired as shown in fig 3a plate like morphology crystals aggregate displaying a flat and smooth surface with few channels by contrast cmz mainly exhibits rough and irregular surfaces accompanied with entries to the channels inside the zeolite framework these results provide that the modification could carve nz remove impurities on the surface and within the pores transform the porous structure and penetrate the channels in the zeolite the element s content of cmz s surface before and after nh4 n adsorption was analyzed by eds as shown in fig 4 the weight percentage of na element on the surface of cmz decreases from 3 28 to 1 35 after the adsorption of nh4 this result further suggests that nh4 is adsorbed through ion exchange with na on the cmz 3 2 adsorption performance 3 2 1 effect of modification processes ph competing ions and cod nh4 n removal efficiencies of zeolites prepared by different modification methods are illustrated in fig 5a the adsorption performance was studied with batch adsorption experiments in simulated water samples cmz exhibits a prominent nh4 n adsorption effect and the removal efficiency is up to 70 70 which reaches10 fold enhancement relative to that of the untreated nz furthermore the removal efficiency of z naoh sa is 52 6 which is obviously higher than that of z naoh nacl 35 1 z naoh 17 4 and z nacl 18 9 suggesting an important role played by succinic acid in the enhancement of nh4 n removal via increasing the amounts of ion exchange sites on the surface of cmz when nz was first modified by naoh and nacl then treated with succinic acid the nh4 n removal efficiency reaches 42 1 and is lower than that of cmz indicating that the modification sequence of nacl and succinic acid also exerts an influence on the adsorptive property besides instead of succinic acid hydrochloric acid was used to treat nz to generate z naoh hcl nacl the nh4 n removal efficiency of z naoh hcl nacl is 32 88 and even lower than that of z naoh nacl it seems that hydrochloric acid treatment did little to improve the ion exchange property probably owing to a small degradation of crystal structures of heulandite constituents 38 these results prove that multiple step modification with naoh succinic acid and nacl is a feasible method for improving the nh4 n removal rate of zeolites 36 37 nh4 n removal rates of cmz at ph values from 4 to 10 are measured as given in fig 4b the maximum nh4 n removal occurs at a ph value of 8 the nh4 n removal decreases with decreasing ph values 8 due to the competition of h and nh4 for taking up ion exchange sites on the surface of cmz by contrast the nh4 n removal also decreases while increasing ph values 8 which could be ascribed to the conversion of nh4 to neutral ammonia nh3 lessening the amount of nh4 in the aqueous solution the observation clearly validates that the nh4 n adsorption onto cmz is a ph dependent process which correlates with the findings from diverse researchers 24 39 40 typically various cations coexisting in sewage including na ca2 and mg2 are competitive for ion exchange sites on cmz s surface fig 5c exhibits the retardation of several cations on nh4 n adsorption by using cmz the retardation capability being sorted from strong to weak is ca2 na and mg2 although these cations can interfere with the nh4 n adsorption onto cmz the nh4 n removal efficiency of cmz still maintain being up to 70 above indicating that cmz possesses an outstanding preferential adsorption performance for nh4 n however it ought to be noticed that different orders of competitiveness have been reported 23 44 45 to study the selectivity of ion exchange for these free cations with na on the zeolite cmz was added in an aqueous solution containing the equivalent concentration 50 mg l 1 of nh4 n na ca2 and mg2 after 4 hour adsorption the values of nh4 n and other three cations were analyzed from fig 5d the order of selectivity for ion exchange with na on cmz is nh4 ca2 mg2 it s worth noting that the ce of na substantially increased because a great amount of na were released from cmz among these four cations the ce of nh4 n is lower than any other cations demonstrating the predominant role of nh4 n adsorption onto cmz to investigate the adsorption behavior of nh4 n onto cmz under the interference of organic pollutants in raw waters fixed bed continuous flow column adsorption experiments for a municipal effluent containing nh4 n and organic pollutants were carried out the values of nh4 n cod bod5 and doc in the initial water and column outlet after 24 hour operation are shown in table 3 a small amount of cod bod5 and doc were removed by cmz while the nh4 n adsorption efficiency still is up to 92 7 indicating little impact of organic pollutants on the ion exchange of nh4 with na on the cmz surface 3 2 2 kinetics study fig 6a depicts the nh4 n removal kinetic data for cmz at five different dosages the nh4 n removal by cmz at the dosage of 20 g l 1 achieves 90 equilibrium removal within 8 h moreover the equilibrium time increases and corresponding removal efficiency decreases when further reducing the dosage of cmz suggesting that a large dosage of cmz will enhance the nh4 n removal efficiency and save the adsorption time as it is mentioned in order to get a high nh4 n removal 85 the dosage of cmz should not be less than 15 g l 1 to identify the key process controlling the adsorption rate pseudo first order pfo pseudo second order pso and intra particle diffusion ipd model 41 are used to fit the experimental data by eqs 4 6 respectively 4 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 5 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t 6 q t kt 0 5 c while k1 k2 and k are adsorption constant of pfo pso and ipd respectively c is intercept these models are used to fit experimental data fig 6b and c and fitted parameters are given in table 4 as expected pso is more suitable for fitting the experiment kinetic data than pfo as indicated by the higher determination coefficient r2 0 996 suggesting the dominant mechanism of nh4 n removal by cmz was controlled by chemisorption or ion exchange mechanism 46 47 the linear fitting plot of the ipd model for experiment data represents the whole nh4 n adsorption process could be composed of three steps including external surface diffusion intra particle diffusion and final equilibrium fig 6c and is controlled by the first two steps 48 the final equilibrium process is probably attributed to the driving to further combing free nh4 with coo on succinic acid together 3 2 3 isotherm study langmuir and freundlich models are utilized and described as follows 7 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 8 q e k f c e 1 n where qm is maximum quantity of nh4 n adsorbed by adsorbents kl kf and n are parameters representing adsorption affinity the adsorption isotherms fitness results of cmz are shown in fig 6d and table 5 notably the nh4 n adsorption isotherm of cmz fits the langmuir model better with a higher determination coefficient r2 0 979 illustrating the nh4 n adsorption behavior onto cmz is inclined to a monolayer adsorption on the homogeneous active sites the maximum adsorption amount of nh4 n calculated by the langmuir model reaches 14 97 mg g 1 furthermore 1 n values in the freundlich equation being generally used to represent the adsorption intensity of adsorbents is less than 0 5 in this study which means that nh4 n in an aqueous solution is easily adsorbed by cmz 49 table 6 summarizes the maximum nh4 n adsorption amount and sizes of existing and potential zeolites based on previously reported data and this study in general natural zeolites show worse absorbability compared to modified zeolites moreover ion exchange by nacl and naoh modification contribute to superior nh4 n adsorption performance of zeolites among various adsorbents naoh modified zeolite nacl modified zeolite and nano3 modified zeolite have a favorable qm 15 075 mg g 1 however these zeolites come in powder form and their sizes are less than 0 83 mm 7 9 24 which would be improper to be placed in the column for nh4 n removal due to blocking the continuous flow and inducing high column pressure by contrast cmz in this study shows a relatively large size 1 3 mm but has also acquired a prominent qm of 14 97 mg g 1 which is beneficial to the placement into the fixed bed continuous flow column for the successive adsorption on the other hand in comparison with cmz iron oxide coated zeolite and silicate carbon modified zeolite cylinders have much lower qm despite a larger size 28 55 being failure to meet the requirement of the current effluent treatment process 3 3 regeneration various sodium solutions such as alkaline nacl naoh and naclo nacl were utilized to regenerate nh4 n saturated zeolite in desorption experiments to analyze the reusability 24 45 50 51 in order to avoid deep erosion of the pore structure of zeolite and destruction of the carboxyl groups on the surface of cmz a regeneration study was performed in ten repeated cycles with neutral nacl rather than heating alkaline or acid methods the results are exhibited in fig 7 and the quantity of nh4 n adsorbed qa desorbed qd and desorption efficiency are calculated by eqs 9 11 respectively 9 q a c 0 c a v a m 10 q d c d v d m 11 desorption q d q a 100 where c0 ca and cd are concentrations of nh4 n in initial aqueous solution terminal aqueous solution when the nh4 n removal efficiency in outlet of column is down to 40 via continuous flow adsorption and regenerant solution after 4 hour regeneration va and vd are the volume of nh4 n adsorbed and regenerant solutions l m is the mass of cmz g the nh4 n adsorption capacity of cmz fluctuates within the range of 13 92 14 55 mg g 1 over 10 cycles of adsorption regeneration idle it should be noted that the nh4 n adsorption capacity initially decreased slightly then gradually increased to a higher level a slowly ascending desorption efficiency during the adsorption desorption idle cycles might account for the improved nh4 n removal performance which could be explained by further modification and more sodium occupying on the active sites within cmz for ion exchange with nh4 overall the adsorption performance of cmz could remain after ten regeneration cycles indicating the outstanding stability and reusability of cmz which could be reused in the water treatment of nh4 n removal for a long time 3 4 modified porous zeolite pellet to improve the hardness and flushing resistance of adsorbents for practical application modified porous zeolite pellets mpzp were prepared according to the procedures of the materials and methods section cmz is crushed to powders to obtain a larger specific surface increasing the areas of the interface between cmz powders and additives the additives contain coal inorganic adhesive and oligomer binder cmz powders are mixed with the additives by extruding and then calcined to zeolite pellets as illustrated in fig 8a during the calcining process the coal and oligomer binder are burned out remaining the interlaced network channels and pores with the increase of temperature the inorganic additives melt and infiltrate to the surface of cmz after cooling to room temperature the resolidified inorganic additives drive the zeolite particles to be tightly connected 3 4 1 characterization fig 8b shows the digital image of modified porous zeolite pellets revealing that mpzp is spherical uniform its diameter is around 3 mm as shown in fig 8c the cross section of mpzp exhibits obvious roughness and larger pore structure in comparison with the morphology of cmz the pxrd pattern of mpzp is shown in fig 9a exhibiting a similar crystal structure with cmz compared with cmz the diffraction peaks of clinoptilolite and heulandite in mpzp are weaker and broader after calcination while the crystal structure of quartz remains stable implying that high temperature calcination would bring on the degradation of the corresponding crystal framework 38 52 the crystallinity loss of heulandite constituents at 550 c is probably attributed to the transformation of the crystalline framework into amorphous species resulting in smaller coherent scattering domains of mpzp it is shown that table 2 and fig 9b the specific surface area of mpzp is 27 31 m2 g 1 being lower than that of cmz however the micropore volume micropore area and pore diameter evidently increase while total pore volume has a slight enhancement which is ascribed to the elimination of coal and formation of larger mesoporous during calcinating moreover the hysteresis loop of mpzp is smaller than that of cmz perhaps mpzp and cmz have different porous channel structures although they are based on the same zeolite 3 4 2 flushing resistance to evaluate the flushing resistance of mpzp and cmz flushing experiments were carried out and the wear rates were calculated for comparison as shown in fig 10 both mpzp and cmz have no wear under flushing at the lower flow rate however when the flow rate reaches up to 20 bv h 1 cmz begins to generate wear while mpzp still holds a relatively lower wear rate with the increase of flow rate the wear behaviors become more apparent the wear rate of mpzp is 0 2 at 50 bv h 1 which is lower than that of cmz 0 1 these results demonstrate that mpzp holds a better flushing resistance than cmz 3 4 3 nh4 n adsorption since the calcination can change the crystal structure of the zeolite nh4 n removal performance of mpzps under different calcination temperature time was further studied as shown in fig 11 the nh4 n removal efficiency of mpzp reaches a maximum of 72 after calcination at 550 c for 2 h calcination at lower temperature leads to incomplete elimination of coal resulting in fewer active adsorption sites to exposure in addition although high temperature calcination enables the zeolite to obtain a great hardness the active sites for ion exchange with nh4 suffer destruction leading to a decrease of nh4 n adsorption capacity of mpzp it is mainly due to the loss of clinoptilolite structure of mpzp when the calcination is performed at over high temperature fig 12 shows the kinetics and isotherm study of the nh4 n adsorption onto mpzp the kinetics data fits the pso model better with a higher determination coefficient r2 0 999 rather than the pfo indicating the adsorption process is composed of various interactions including electrostatic interaction chemical reaction and intra particle diffusion furthermore the ipd model was applied and the result is similar to that of cmz it is worth noting that in the final linear step the adsorption uptake reaches a maximum and remains constant which is different from that of cmz besides the langmuir model is more suitable to describe the nh4 n adsorption isotherm process and the value of qm 9 96 mg g 1 is found to be less than cmz it is mainly ascribed to the disappearance of acid active sites within mpzp after calcination though a drop in the performance of nh4 n adsorption the high hardness and the prominent flushing resistance exhibited by mpzp are attractive for practical applications 3 4 4 regeneration the regeneration study was performed in five repeated cycles to evaluate the reusability of mpzp the results are exhibited in fig 13 and the quantity of nh4 n adsorbed qa desorbed qd and desorption efficiency are calculated by eqs 9 11 respectively the nh4 n adsorption capacity of mpzp is about 8 45 mg g 1 which is lower than that of cmz similar to cmz the adsorption performance of mpzp could remain after five regeneration cycles suggesting the outstanding stability and reusability 4 conclusion in conclusion a chinese natural zeolite with a lower nsi nal ratio was chosen for modification to develop a reusable adsorbent that can be utilized to remove nh4 n from wastewater various aqueous solutions with different modification agents including naoh succinic acid and nacl were performed to modify the zeolites successively the modification removed the impurities that block the pores and improved the potential of the zeolite surface moreover a great amount of carboxylate groups was distributed on the surface of zeolite as active adsorption sites the obtained cmz with a size of 1 3 mm exhibits a prominent nh4 n removal efficiency of 82 37 at ph 8 and high selectivity for nh4 n besides the nh4 n adsorption kinetic is adhered to the pfo model while the isotherm data could be well fitted with the langmuir model indicating a chemical monolayer adsorption process after ten regeneration times cmz maintained the nh4 n adsorption capacity of 13 92 14 55 mg g 1 suggesting outstanding stability and reusability to improve the flushing resistance of zeolites mpzp with porous structures was further developed mpzp holds a relatively lower wear rate of 0 1 at the continuous flow rate of 50 bv h 1 indicating a long service life all these advantages of cmz and mpzp realize a promising nh4 n adsorbent for a successive wastewater treatment process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

12930,inspired by the development of adsorption techniques an adsorbent for ammonium nh4 n removal featuring high selectivity towards nh4 n high adsorption capacity simplicity of use low cost and environmental friendliness have attracted great attention in recent years during this work a natural zeolite with a lower nsi nal ratio of 4 2 was selected as the modified substrate various modification agents including naoh succinic acid sa and nacl were performed to modify the zeolites successively due to succinic acid assisted modification plenty of carboxylate groups were distributed on the surface of zeolite as active adsorption sites the modified zeolite cmz shows a significant nh4 n adsorption capacity which is much higher 10 fold than that of natural zeolites moreover cmz also shows high selectivity for nh4 n among several cations including na ca2 and mg2 the nh4 n adsorption kinetics and isotherms of cmz fit the pseudo first order and langmuir model confirming a chemical monolayer adsorption process after ten regeneration times cmz maintained the high nh4 n adsorption capacity of around 14 55 mg g 1 showing outstanding stability and reusability when reused for water treatment in addition a modified porous zeolite pellet mpzp was further prepared mpzp holds a relatively lower wear rate of 0 1 at the continuous flow rate of 50 bv h 1 suggesting high flushing resistance and long service life graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords natural zeolite succinic acid modification ammonium nitrogen adsorption 1 introduction ammonium nh4 n is the most frequent form of nitrogen contamination in wastewaters nh4 n contaminants stem from municipal sewage industrial wastewater agricultural wastes and other sources 1 2 if not handled properly this pollutant is readily introduced into surface water and groundwater resources resulting in a damaging impact on the ecological environment and human health for example the discharge of untreated nitrogen loading wastewaters into the natural water environment will lead to toxic algal blooms which can contribute to hypoxia zones fish kills and poor drinking water quality 3 4 in particular the nitrates and nitrites generated from the oxidation of nh4 n compounds pose a significant risk to human health 5 numerous available technologies for nh4 n removal including biological degradation physical and chemical adsorption have been previously reported 6 10 compared with conventional ways the ion exchange method is widely recognized as a promising technique owing to favorable characteristics such as high selectivity towards nh4 n high adsorption capacity simplicity of use low cost and environmental friendliness 11 among various absorbents the ion exchange resin has been thought of as an effective adsorption material for nh4 n removal because of its safety efficiency and high ion exchange capacity 12 nevertheless its high price short service life and environmental pollution caused by incineration after being abandoned make it less feasible in large scale applications some adsorbents such as activated carbon biochar bentonite and other clay materials have also been reported for the removal of nh4 n 13 16 however due to the low adsorption capacity high service cost no regeneration or difficulty in operation these materials are limited in industrial application zeolite is an alkali metal aluminosilicate with a crystal structure composed of silicon and aluminum tetrahedra 17 the extensive internal pores and interconnected channels result in a large specific surface area to provide enough adsorption sites which are occupied by alkali metal ions for ion exchange with nh4 n 18 20 theoretically the nsi nal ratio of the natural zeolite determines the ion exchange capacity a lower nsi nal ratio implies that more cations are bound onto the zeolite framework which is helpful for increasing the ion exchange capacity natural zeolites around the world with the nsi nal ratio between 4 4 and 6 3 3 7 8 10 18 24 53 54 have a relatively lower ion exchange capacity to improve the relatively low ion exchange capacity natural zeolite is usually physically or chemically modified by the alkali metal ions with a stronger ion exchange capability such as na 21 several studies have been reported on zeolites which were modified by nacl naoh or nano3 to improve the nh4 n absorption capacity 22 24 however it is also believed that the active sites for ion exchange could not be fully revealed via a single modification treatment the development of a facile and proper modification method for further enhancement of the nh4 n absorption capacity of zeolites remains extremely challenging and is demanded in this contribution nacl succinic acid and naoh were all employed as modification agents to clear the blockage in the pores and improve the potential of zeolite surface succinic acid was utilized for providing carboxyl groups as additional active adsorption sites a natural zeolite from china s hebei province with a lower nsi nal ratio of 4 2 was chosen for modification the batch adsorption behaviors of obtained samples denoted as cmz including the kinetics and isotherm were further investigated to realize the efficient separation of adsorbents from treated water during the adsorption process a fixed bed continuous flow column was employed for adsorption and regeneration in comparison with natural zeolites cmz exhibits a prominent nh4 n absorption capacity at a large size 1 3 mm finally to prolong service life with high hardness a modified porous zeolite pellet mpzp based on cmz was prepared these studies demonstrate that both cmz and mpzp hold great potential for practical applications in nh4 n removal from wastewater via fixed bed continuous flow column 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials natural zeolites nz particle size 1 3 mm employed were purchased from hebei province china and the chemical composition is illustrated in table 1 before experiments nz was washed and dried at 100 c chemicals used during the experiments including sodium hydroxide sodium chloride succinic acid and ammonium chloride were analytical grade and purchased from the sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china deionized water was used throughout the experiment municipal effluent containing nh4 n and organic pollutants was supplied by hangzhou shangtuo environmental technology co ltd 2 2 multiple step modification of nz the multiple step modified zeolite cmz was prepared as follows 3 g nz was added into 100 ml of 4 wt naoh aqueous solution and stirred at 95 c for 5 h the treated zeolite was filtered washed until neutral and then dried at 100 c to afford naoh modified zeolite z naoh subsequently z naoh was placed in 100 ml of 3 wt succinic acid aqueous solution this mixture was maintained at 25 c and shaken at 150 rpm for 6 h in a thermostatic shaker thz 82 changzhou guohua electric appliance co ltd china after filtration solid particles were washed and dried again to yield a two step modified zeolite z naoh pa finally z naoh pa was placed into 100 ml of 30 wt nacl aqueous solution and stirred at room temperature for 6 h thereafter filtered particles were rinsed and then dried to obtain cmz z naoh pa nacl 2 3 preparation of modified porous zeolite pellet cmz was crushed and passed through an 80 meshes sieve to generate cmz powders then the cmz powders were mixed with the mixed additives at a ratio of 84 16 after adding some water the mixture was extruded and pelletized to clay pellets the clay pellets were dried at 100 c for 2 h and further calcined in a muffle furnace at 550 c for 2 h to obtain modified porous zeolite pellets mpzp with 3 mm particle size 2 4 characterization mineralogical compositions of samples were examined using x ray powder diffraction pxrd measurements bruker d8 advance x ray powder diffractometer pxrd patterns were recorded using ni filtered cu kα radiation at 40 kv and 40 ma in the 2θ range of 5 80 with a step length of 0 04 structural changes were determined by a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrophotometer thermo scientific nicolet is50 the ftir spectrum was recorded in the frequency ranging from 400 to 4000 cm 1 cmz s surface and mpzp s cross section morphologies and element contents were observed by scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds zeiss supratm 55 before observation all samples were placed in a vacuum chamber and sputter coated with a layer of gold for 15 s the n2 adsorption brunauer emmett teller bet method was employed to determine the surface area and pore size distribution using a micromeritics instrument micromeritics asap 2460 the pore size distribution curves were calculated using the barrett joyner halenda algorithm 2 5 batch adsorption studies the sample was placed into a flask with nh4 n aqueous solution thereafter the flask was placed in a thermostatic shaker agitating at 130 rpm at 25 c then the solution was filtered and the concentration of nh4 n in the filtrate was measured the capacity and removal rate were determined by the following equations 1 removal c 0 c t c 0 100 2 q t c 0 c t v m 3 q e c 0 c e v m where c0 ct and ce are initial final nh4 n concentration at time t and equilibrium time mg l 1 respectively qt and qe are the amount of nh4 n adsorbed at time t and equilibrium time respectively mg g 1 v is the volume of solution l and m is the mass of the adsorbent g the effect of solution ph on nh4 n removal was studied by changing the ph value from 4 to 10 and the effect of cmz s dosage was evaluated by varying dosage from 3 to 20 g l 1 moreover the interference of the coexisting ions on nh4 n removal was studied via adding three cations na ca2 and mg2 into nh4 n aqueous solution with the same concentration of 50 mg l 1 kinetic studies were investigated by adding zeolite into 50 mg l 1 nh4 n aqueous solution solution was collected at different contact times for the aid of a membrane filter furthermore equilibrium isotherm studies were carried out by placing samples into 100 ml of 50 mg l 1 nh4 n aqueous solution by varying adsorbent dosages from 1 to 20 g l 1 to achieve sorption equilibrium all the experiments were repeated twice 2 6 column adsorption fixed bed continuous flow column adsorption experiments involving ten successive adsorption and desorption cycles were performed with a glass column diameter of 2 5 cm height of 28 cm with a packed bed volume of 120 ml the column was firstly packed with the zeolite then saturated with nh4 n by pumping synthetic nh4cl aqueous solution downward at a flow rate of 5 bed volumes bv h 1 adsorption saturated zeolite was then regenerated by flowing nacl aqueous solution upward for 4 h at the flow rate of 8 bv h 1 the nh4 n concentrations in the eluate and the regeneration solution were measured to analyze quantities of nh4 n adsorbed or desorbed the same experiments were performed for mpzp a schematic of the column adsorption and regeneration experiment is shown in fig 1 fixed bed continuous flow column adsorption experiments for a municipal effluent containing nh4 n and organic pollutants were also carried out in the glass column the column height 30 cm inner diameter 2 5 cm was first packed with zeolites volume 120 ml then the municipal effluent was pumped downwards at the flow rate of 5 bv h 1 the concentrations of nh4 n chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod5 and dissolved organic carbon doc in inlet and outlet of the column after 24 hour operation were analyzed 2 7 flushing experiments flushing experiments were conducted in a glass column packed with mpzp nh4cl aqueous solution was firstly pumped from the top of the column for 1 h at different flow rates 10 150 bv h 1 then nacl aqueous solution was pumped upward for 1 h at the same rate after the flushing mpzp were taken out dried and weighed wear rates at different flow rates were calculated as follow wear rate lost mass initial mass same experiments were performed for cmz 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization fig 2a illustrates the ftir spectrum of nz cmz and succinic acid cmz still maintains the fundamental structure and exhibits significant vibration characteristics of nz typically peaks of nz and cmz at 3700 3200 cm 1 1636 cm 1 1067 cm 1 779 cm 1 605 601 cm 1 and 458 cm 1 are assigned to υo h δo h υsi o υal o υsio4 and υalo4 respectively 25 27 the peak intensity at 1636 cm 1 of cmz shows an obvious decrease in comparison with that of nz owing to the loss of crystallized water which could bring about more pore structure and then improve the nh4 n adsorption performance of zeolite 26 in addition υc o and δc h observed at 1690 cm 1 and 1308 cm 1 indicate that carboxylate groups are distributed on the surface of cmz after pa modification compared with the ftir spectrum of succinic acid the absence of υo h at 3500 2500 cm 1 and δo h at 916 cm 1 of cmz suggests that succinic acids covalently bond to the surface of cmz the pxrd patterns of nz and cmz shown in fig 2b indicate that the main components in nz were clinoptilolite ca c kna2ca2 si29al7 o72 24h2o heulandite ca h ca3 6k0 8al8 8si27 4o72 26 1h2o and quartz q sio2 from the pxrd diffractogram both nz and cmz exhibit similar spectral lines within the variety of diffraction peaks suggesting the overall skeletal structural integrity of zeolite before and after modification 22 28 30 however compared to nz cmz show a slight reduction within the intensity of clinoptilolite ca and heulandite diffraction peaks which could be attributed to the partial dissolution of clinoptilolite ca after naoh treatment and the ion exchange behavior of na with ca2 on the heulandite after nacl modification 26 31 32 besides cmz after nh4 n adsorption displayed no appreciable change in the pxrd patterns suggesting that the ion exchange process has few influences on the crystalline structure of cmz bet results of nz and cmz are illustrated in fig 2c d and table 2 the hysteresis loops appearing in a relative pressure ranging from 0 4 to 1 0 confirm mesopores within the zeolite it is noted that the specific surface area of cmz is significantly higher than that of nz additionally after multiple step modification of the nz a great enhancement within total pore volume and the drop of average pore width indicates that a large number of mesopores come into being in cmz as proved previously naoh and nacl cleared the pore channels and voids of nz inducing the formation of numerous microporous and mesoporous structures 33 34 furthermore the decrease in pore size of cmz was presumably due to the generation of much smaller mesopores and aggregation of pa molecules on channels and the external surface of cmz 35 to assess the surface morphology change of nz before and after modification and to evaluate the chemical modification effect sem images of nz and cmz were acquired as shown in fig 3a plate like morphology crystals aggregate displaying a flat and smooth surface with few channels by contrast cmz mainly exhibits rough and irregular surfaces accompanied with entries to the channels inside the zeolite framework these results provide that the modification could carve nz remove impurities on the surface and within the pores transform the porous structure and penetrate the channels in the zeolite the element s content of cmz s surface before and after nh4 n adsorption was analyzed by eds as shown in fig 4 the weight percentage of na element on the surface of cmz decreases from 3 28 to 1 35 after the adsorption of nh4 this result further suggests that nh4 is adsorbed through ion exchange with na on the cmz 3 2 adsorption performance 3 2 1 effect of modification processes ph competing ions and cod nh4 n removal efficiencies of zeolites prepared by different modification methods are illustrated in fig 5a the adsorption performance was studied with batch adsorption experiments in simulated water samples cmz exhibits a prominent nh4 n adsorption effect and the removal efficiency is up to 70 70 which reaches10 fold enhancement relative to that of the untreated nz furthermore the removal efficiency of z naoh sa is 52 6 which is obviously higher than that of z naoh nacl 35 1 z naoh 17 4 and z nacl 18 9 suggesting an important role played by succinic acid in the enhancement of nh4 n removal via increasing the amounts of ion exchange sites on the surface of cmz when nz was first modified by naoh and nacl then treated with succinic acid the nh4 n removal efficiency reaches 42 1 and is lower than that of cmz indicating that the modification sequence of nacl and succinic acid also exerts an influence on the adsorptive property besides instead of succinic acid hydrochloric acid was used to treat nz to generate z naoh hcl nacl the nh4 n removal efficiency of z naoh hcl nacl is 32 88 and even lower than that of z naoh nacl it seems that hydrochloric acid treatment did little to improve the ion exchange property probably owing to a small degradation of crystal structures of heulandite constituents 38 these results prove that multiple step modification with naoh succinic acid and nacl is a feasible method for improving the nh4 n removal rate of zeolites 36 37 nh4 n removal rates of cmz at ph values from 4 to 10 are measured as given in fig 4b the maximum nh4 n removal occurs at a ph value of 8 the nh4 n removal decreases with decreasing ph values 8 due to the competition of h and nh4 for taking up ion exchange sites on the surface of cmz by contrast the nh4 n removal also decreases while increasing ph values 8 which could be ascribed to the conversion of nh4 to neutral ammonia nh3 lessening the amount of nh4 in the aqueous solution the observation clearly validates that the nh4 n adsorption onto cmz is a ph dependent process which correlates with the findings from diverse researchers 24 39 40 typically various cations coexisting in sewage including na ca2 and mg2 are competitive for ion exchange sites on cmz s surface fig 5c exhibits the retardation of several cations on nh4 n adsorption by using cmz the retardation capability being sorted from strong to weak is ca2 na and mg2 although these cations can interfere with the nh4 n adsorption onto cmz the nh4 n removal efficiency of cmz still maintain being up to 70 above indicating that cmz possesses an outstanding preferential adsorption performance for nh4 n however it ought to be noticed that different orders of competitiveness have been reported 23 44 45 to study the selectivity of ion exchange for these free cations with na on the zeolite cmz was added in an aqueous solution containing the equivalent concentration 50 mg l 1 of nh4 n na ca2 and mg2 after 4 hour adsorption the values of nh4 n and other three cations were analyzed from fig 5d the order of selectivity for ion exchange with na on cmz is nh4 ca2 mg2 it s worth noting that the ce of na substantially increased because a great amount of na were released from cmz among these four cations the ce of nh4 n is lower than any other cations demonstrating the predominant role of nh4 n adsorption onto cmz to investigate the adsorption behavior of nh4 n onto cmz under the interference of organic pollutants in raw waters fixed bed continuous flow column adsorption experiments for a municipal effluent containing nh4 n and organic pollutants were carried out the values of nh4 n cod bod5 and doc in the initial water and column outlet after 24 hour operation are shown in table 3 a small amount of cod bod5 and doc were removed by cmz while the nh4 n adsorption efficiency still is up to 92 7 indicating little impact of organic pollutants on the ion exchange of nh4 with na on the cmz surface 3 2 2 kinetics study fig 6a depicts the nh4 n removal kinetic data for cmz at five different dosages the nh4 n removal by cmz at the dosage of 20 g l 1 achieves 90 equilibrium removal within 8 h moreover the equilibrium time increases and corresponding removal efficiency decreases when further reducing the dosage of cmz suggesting that a large dosage of cmz will enhance the nh4 n removal efficiency and save the adsorption time as it is mentioned in order to get a high nh4 n removal 85 the dosage of cmz should not be less than 15 g l 1 to identify the key process controlling the adsorption rate pseudo first order pfo pseudo second order pso and intra particle diffusion ipd model 41 are used to fit the experimental data by eqs 4 6 respectively 4 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 5 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t 6 q t kt 0 5 c while k1 k2 and k are adsorption constant of pfo pso and ipd respectively c is intercept these models are used to fit experimental data fig 6b and c and fitted parameters are given in table 4 as expected pso is more suitable for fitting the experiment kinetic data than pfo as indicated by the higher determination coefficient r2 0 996 suggesting the dominant mechanism of nh4 n removal by cmz was controlled by chemisorption or ion exchange mechanism 46 47 the linear fitting plot of the ipd model for experiment data represents the whole nh4 n adsorption process could be composed of three steps including external surface diffusion intra particle diffusion and final equilibrium fig 6c and is controlled by the first two steps 48 the final equilibrium process is probably attributed to the driving to further combing free nh4 with coo on succinic acid together 3 2 3 isotherm study langmuir and freundlich models are utilized and described as follows 7 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 8 q e k f c e 1 n where qm is maximum quantity of nh4 n adsorbed by adsorbents kl kf and n are parameters representing adsorption affinity the adsorption isotherms fitness results of cmz are shown in fig 6d and table 5 notably the nh4 n adsorption isotherm of cmz fits the langmuir model better with a higher determination coefficient r2 0 979 illustrating the nh4 n adsorption behavior onto cmz is inclined to a monolayer adsorption on the homogeneous active sites the maximum adsorption amount of nh4 n calculated by the langmuir model reaches 14 97 mg g 1 furthermore 1 n values in the freundlich equation being generally used to represent the adsorption intensity of adsorbents is less than 0 5 in this study which means that nh4 n in an aqueous solution is easily adsorbed by cmz 49 table 6 summarizes the maximum nh4 n adsorption amount and sizes of existing and potential zeolites based on previously reported data and this study in general natural zeolites show worse absorbability compared to modified zeolites moreover ion exchange by nacl and naoh modification contribute to superior nh4 n adsorption performance of zeolites among various adsorbents naoh modified zeolite nacl modified zeolite and nano3 modified zeolite have a favorable qm 15 075 mg g 1 however these zeolites come in powder form and their sizes are less than 0 83 mm 7 9 24 which would be improper to be placed in the column for nh4 n removal due to blocking the continuous flow and inducing high column pressure by contrast cmz in this study shows a relatively large size 1 3 mm but has also acquired a prominent qm of 14 97 mg g 1 which is beneficial to the placement into the fixed bed continuous flow column for the successive adsorption on the other hand in comparison with cmz iron oxide coated zeolite and silicate carbon modified zeolite cylinders have much lower qm despite a larger size 28 55 being failure to meet the requirement of the current effluent treatment process 3 3 regeneration various sodium solutions such as alkaline nacl naoh and naclo nacl were utilized to regenerate nh4 n saturated zeolite in desorption experiments to analyze the reusability 24 45 50 51 in order to avoid deep erosion of the pore structure of zeolite and destruction of the carboxyl groups on the surface of cmz a regeneration study was performed in ten repeated cycles with neutral nacl rather than heating alkaline or acid methods the results are exhibited in fig 7 and the quantity of nh4 n adsorbed qa desorbed qd and desorption efficiency are calculated by eqs 9 11 respectively 9 q a c 0 c a v a m 10 q d c d v d m 11 desorption q d q a 100 where c0 ca and cd are concentrations of nh4 n in initial aqueous solution terminal aqueous solution when the nh4 n removal efficiency in outlet of column is down to 40 via continuous flow adsorption and regenerant solution after 4 hour regeneration va and vd are the volume of nh4 n adsorbed and regenerant solutions l m is the mass of cmz g the nh4 n adsorption capacity of cmz fluctuates within the range of 13 92 14 55 mg g 1 over 10 cycles of adsorption regeneration idle it should be noted that the nh4 n adsorption capacity initially decreased slightly then gradually increased to a higher level a slowly ascending desorption efficiency during the adsorption desorption idle cycles might account for the improved nh4 n removal performance which could be explained by further modification and more sodium occupying on the active sites within cmz for ion exchange with nh4 overall the adsorption performance of cmz could remain after ten regeneration cycles indicating the outstanding stability and reusability of cmz which could be reused in the water treatment of nh4 n removal for a long time 3 4 modified porous zeolite pellet to improve the hardness and flushing resistance of adsorbents for practical application modified porous zeolite pellets mpzp were prepared according to the procedures of the materials and methods section cmz is crushed to powders to obtain a larger specific surface increasing the areas of the interface between cmz powders and additives the additives contain coal inorganic adhesive and oligomer binder cmz powders are mixed with the additives by extruding and then calcined to zeolite pellets as illustrated in fig 8a during the calcining process the coal and oligomer binder are burned out remaining the interlaced network channels and pores with the increase of temperature the inorganic additives melt and infiltrate to the surface of cmz after cooling to room temperature the resolidified inorganic additives drive the zeolite particles to be tightly connected 3 4 1 characterization fig 8b shows the digital image of modified porous zeolite pellets revealing that mpzp is spherical uniform its diameter is around 3 mm as shown in fig 8c the cross section of mpzp exhibits obvious roughness and larger pore structure in comparison with the morphology of cmz the pxrd pattern of mpzp is shown in fig 9a exhibiting a similar crystal structure with cmz compared with cmz the diffraction peaks of clinoptilolite and heulandite in mpzp are weaker and broader after calcination while the crystal structure of quartz remains stable implying that high temperature calcination would bring on the degradation of the corresponding crystal framework 38 52 the crystallinity loss of heulandite constituents at 550 c is probably attributed to the transformation of the crystalline framework into amorphous species resulting in smaller coherent scattering domains of mpzp it is shown that table 2 and fig 9b the specific surface area of mpzp is 27 31 m2 g 1 being lower than that of cmz however the micropore volume micropore area and pore diameter evidently increase while total pore volume has a slight enhancement which is ascribed to the elimination of coal and formation of larger mesoporous during calcinating moreover the hysteresis loop of mpzp is smaller than that of cmz perhaps mpzp and cmz have different porous channel structures although they are based on the same zeolite 3 4 2 flushing resistance to evaluate the flushing resistance of mpzp and cmz flushing experiments were carried out and the wear rates were calculated for comparison as shown in fig 10 both mpzp and cmz have no wear under flushing at the lower flow rate however when the flow rate reaches up to 20 bv h 1 cmz begins to generate wear while mpzp still holds a relatively lower wear rate with the increase of flow rate the wear behaviors become more apparent the wear rate of mpzp is 0 2 at 50 bv h 1 which is lower than that of cmz 0 1 these results demonstrate that mpzp holds a better flushing resistance than cmz 3 4 3 nh4 n adsorption since the calcination can change the crystal structure of the zeolite nh4 n removal performance of mpzps under different calcination temperature time was further studied as shown in fig 11 the nh4 n removal efficiency of mpzp reaches a maximum of 72 after calcination at 550 c for 2 h calcination at lower temperature leads to incomplete elimination of coal resulting in fewer active adsorption sites to exposure in addition although high temperature calcination enables the zeolite to obtain a great hardness the active sites for ion exchange with nh4 suffer destruction leading to a decrease of nh4 n adsorption capacity of mpzp it is mainly due to the loss of clinoptilolite structure of mpzp when the calcination is performed at over high temperature fig 12 shows the kinetics and isotherm study of the nh4 n adsorption onto mpzp the kinetics data fits the pso model better with a higher determination coefficient r2 0 999 rather than the pfo indicating the adsorption process is composed of various interactions including electrostatic interaction chemical reaction and intra particle diffusion furthermore the ipd model was applied and the result is similar to that of cmz it is worth noting that in the final linear step the adsorption uptake reaches a maximum and remains constant which is different from that of cmz besides the langmuir model is more suitable to describe the nh4 n adsorption isotherm process and the value of qm 9 96 mg g 1 is found to be less than cmz it is mainly ascribed to the disappearance of acid active sites within mpzp after calcination though a drop in the performance of nh4 n adsorption the high hardness and the prominent flushing resistance exhibited by mpzp are attractive for practical applications 3 4 4 regeneration the regeneration study was performed in five repeated cycles to evaluate the reusability of mpzp the results are exhibited in fig 13 and the quantity of nh4 n adsorbed qa desorbed qd and desorption efficiency are calculated by eqs 9 11 respectively the nh4 n adsorption capacity of mpzp is about 8 45 mg g 1 which is lower than that of cmz similar to cmz the adsorption performance of mpzp could remain after five regeneration cycles suggesting the outstanding stability and reusability 4 conclusion in conclusion a chinese natural zeolite with a lower nsi nal ratio was chosen for modification to develop a reusable adsorbent that can be utilized to remove nh4 n from wastewater various aqueous solutions with different modification agents including naoh succinic acid and nacl were performed to modify the zeolites successively the modification removed the impurities that block the pores and improved the potential of the zeolite surface moreover a great amount of carboxylate groups was distributed on the surface of zeolite as active adsorption sites the obtained cmz with a size of 1 3 mm exhibits a prominent nh4 n removal efficiency of 82 37 at ph 8 and high selectivity for nh4 n besides the nh4 n adsorption kinetic is adhered to the pfo model while the isotherm data could be well fitted with the langmuir model indicating a chemical monolayer adsorption process after ten regeneration times cmz maintained the nh4 n adsorption capacity of 13 92 14 55 mg g 1 suggesting outstanding stability and reusability to improve the flushing resistance of zeolites mpzp with porous structures was further developed mpzp holds a relatively lower wear rate of 0 1 at the continuous flow rate of 50 bv h 1 indicating a long service life all these advantages of cmz and mpzp realize a promising nh4 n adsorbent for a successive wastewater treatment process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

keywords anionic surfactant chemical oxygen demand microplastic electrocoagulation personal care products membrane filtration 1 introduction recently with the increase of consumer demand the production amount of personal care products has considerably increased 1 several agencies such as the united states environmental protection agency usepa declared that cosmetic and pharmaceutical products are classified as high polarity pollutants low volatility and continuous pass through wastewater treatment plants 2 with the development of analytical techniques many chemical compounds that were previously undetectable due to their low concentrations nowadays they can be identified in domestic wastewater 3 4 previous research works have already dedicated studies on pharmaceutical field 5 7 however serious problems such as the treatment of wastewater generated during the production of personal care products pcp such as body shampoo facial cleanser toothpaste soap etc remains unsolved 8 in personal care products industry wastewater with high carbon content and toxic compounds is generated 9 several studies have proposed aerobic and anaerobic biological process for pcp wastewater treatment however due to the presence of substances such as detergent oil and grease in wastewater satisfied efficiencies have not been attained 10 11 owing to the high cod loading the energy related of aerobic treatment is quite high and eventually cost is affected for anaerobic treatment process microorganisms producing methane can be inhibited due to oxidants dyes and ammonia containing in the pcp wastewater 9 11 conventional treatment methods are not adequate to effectively purify pcp wastewater from such pollutants matamoras et al 57 studied the elimination capacity of thirteen different secondary pcp wastewater treatment plant systems and determined that the removal efficiencies of most contaminants were limited to 50 in pcp wastewater treatment surfactants are one of the main obstacles which are fronting the treatment process efficiency surfactants use is extremely common in pcp industry and their consumption is estimated to be over 24 million tons in 2022 12 several studies reported that if the sulfonate containing in wastewater is not treated it may cause additional mucus emission which threaten sea biomass lives 13 critical toxicity tests show that lc50 values of anionic surfactants can vary according to the species nature between 110 and 92 000 mg therefore most of the tested surfactants so far have been categorized as harmful and very toxic as published and agreed at the european union directive 67 548 eec 14 for all these reasons it is vital to remove surfactants from wastewater before its disposal to the environment 12 however there are only few studies that investigated their removal simultaneously with other pollutants 15 because of their toxicity and unpreventable spread microplastics are becoming a major global conservation issue personal care products are one of the biggest sources of these microplastics due to the use of microplastics in personal care products they have been excluded in many countries whereas it is still possible to access such products in some other countries among them turkey 16 bioplastics generated from cosmetic industry are representing the dominant source of plastics in sea water passed via sewage systems 17 currently in most wastewater treatment stations microplastics are not among target contaminants to be eliminated though the importance of bioplastics removal only few studies have been published investigating the elimination of those pollutants 15 18 several previous work dealt with the removal of microplastics with the following processes electrocoagulation 19 20 membrane bioreactor 21 and adsorption using carbon nanotubes 22 one of the important wastewater treatment processes is electrocoagulation which has been used to substitute chemical coagulation electrocoagulation is based on cations production by metal electrodes within an electric field 23 electrocoagulation process displayed diverse advantages including not limited to its automation system energy efficiency low cost and the reduction of adsorbent use are among the most important advantages 24 so far integrated or combined processes physical biological and chemical processes such as electrochemical ozone membrane as well as the activated sludge are used extensively to enhance removal efficiency of multiple pollutants containing in wastewater 25 27 a continuous treatment process can be established by integrating a cross flow membrane system with different processes types as reported in many studies 28 the revealed innovation by this study is the evaluation of removing organic matter surfactant and microplastics

model among the various models table 2 is summarizing the obtained experimental results evaluations were made on the removal efficiency by using eq 1 1 removal efficiency initial concentration final concentration initial concentration 2 5 permeation flux the permeation flux j was measured as the quantity of the permeate produced during membrane separation in determined intervals and calculated by eq 2 2 j v ax t where j is the permeate flux l m2 h v is the volume of membrane permeate l a is the effective area of the membrane m2 and δt is the filtration time h 2 6 kinetics and isotherms adsorption process and electrocoagulation process reactions are similar to each other adsorption kinetic needs to be examined in order to understand the adsorption steps that affect the rate of the adsorption process 32 nevertheless the pollutants removal in electrochemical process was carried out in two stages namely the formation of metal flocs at the anode and the adsorption of cations on flocs surface 33 the most common kinetic models including first order 58 second order 59 pseudo first order 60 and pseudo second order 60 were applied to define the mechanisms of adsorption under optimum conditions in order to examine the removal of the pollutants the relevant kinetic and isotherm models are given in table 3 34 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical experiments 3 1 1 electrode optimization the effect of electrode pair has been studied since electrode type presents an important influence on the efficiency of the process the chemical reactions that occur on the electrode surface depend on electrode type by using 5 different electrodes al ss fe gr ti it has been investigated whether the pollutants cod surfactant and oil grease can be removed efficiently by electrocoagulation and or electrooxidation processes the maximum cod removal efficiencies were 74 3 89 6 63 2 29 7 and 14 6 with al ss fe gr and ti electrodes respectively fig 2a the sacrificial ss electrode pair supplied the highest organic removal moreover the highest surfactant and oil grease removal efficiencies were obtained as 99 4 and 99 3 with the ss electrode fig 2b and c therefore forward experiments were performed using the most efficient electrode material which is ss electrode according to 35 iron chromium nickel ions were released from stainless steel electrodes as a result amorphous fe oh 2 is formed in the reactor which has a bulky surface area required for speedy adsorption of soluble organic compounds and capture of colloidal particles the fact that it has higher removal efficiency than with iron electrode actually this corresponds to the data in the literature referring to another study the stainless steel cathode provides 30 more removal efficiency compared to iron cathode 36 3 1 2 optimization via response surface methodology a full quadratic model was followed to fix significant removal efficiencies parameters of cod y 1 surfactant y 2 and oil grease y 3 using ss electrode calibrating with the experimental results derived from the one factor at a time experiment the quadratic regression models are given by eqs 3 5 for y1 y2 and y3 respectively 3 y 1

3 where a is the ph b is the current density and c is the time fig 3 table 4 illustrates the anova analysis for rsm quadratic models the effects of current density ph and retention time on cod removal efficiency using ss electrode pairs are presented in fig 4a c as shown in fig 4a the maximum removal efficiency was 80 which obtained at ph 4 and 50 a m2 of current density at lower current density removal efficiency increased from 67 to 80 when ph was decreased from 10 to 4 this result proves the significance of ph value in particular at lower current densities as the adsorption capacities of electrode is higher at acidic ph 37 however the retention time revealed less importance at acidic ph values fig 4b similar observation is noticed in the current density vs time graph however it is seen that as the current density decreases the removal efficiency increases regardless of time variation besides p value for ab ph x current density was found as 0 0076 which shows that interaction between these two parameters was obvious so far ec process was used to treat high strength wastewaters such as biodiesel wastewater with 588 800 mg l cod value in lab scale studies 38 the cod removal efficiency was ranged from 20 9 to 99 9 with mostly over 75 efficiency 39 most studies in the literature reported that the highest removal efficiency with ss electrodes was obtained at neutral ph 40 41 the variation of surfactant removal with respect to the current density initial ph and time via ss electrodes is shown in fig 5 optimum parameters were determined as current density of 150 a m2 initial ph of 7 and 240 min of retention time with a removal efficiency of 98 71 as seen in fig 5 time has a little effect on surfactant removal when the time was increased from 120 to 240 min the removal efficiency increased from 82 to 98 corresponding to similar results reported by dimoglo et al 42 in the same study which was investigated at lower concentrations it was reported that 83 of surfactant was removed in 03 min at 05 min removal efficiency reached 91 and after that no more surfactants could be removed although successful removal efficiency was obtained at lower current density in two previous studies 15 42 the initial surfactant concentration in the current study was much higher 2560 mg l compared to those tested previously 7 51 and 77 98 mg l respectively it is seen that the midpoints of ph and current density are the points of maximum removal efficiency but the increase in current density from 100 to 150 a m2 negatively affected the surfactant removal same as the ph is increased the electrocoagulation remediation process is incredibly successful at destabilizing water and oil emulsions as the oil in water and oil emulsion show a net electrical charge on the drop surface since hydrogen bubbles enter the wastewater they become more buoyant so that the oil is then deposited on the reactor tank surface quickly where it is removed as a result of the stripping process 43 as seen in fig 6 the highest oil grease removal efficiency was obtained as 98 62 at ph 7 and 100 a m2 of current density in 180 min of reaction time the impact of ph and retention time on the removal ratio was not significant as seen in fig 6c besides p value for ac ph x time was 0 4130 which shows that removal efficiency is independent of ph and time from fig 6a the current density appears to be a determining factor in general it has been found that as the current density increases the removal efficiency increases accordingly this is related to the increase of bubbles formed with the increase in the current density 44 3 2 electrode and sludge characterization sem technique at 5000 magnification was used to investigate the surface morphology of ss electrode before and after the treatment process moreover sludge occurring after electrochemical treatment was also analyzed fig 7 showed that the surface morphology of the unused ss electrodes changed after the treatment process on unused ss electrode surface shown in fig 7a small crystals and slightly uneven surface can be seen due to steel being prepared as hot rolled steel 45 as shown in fig 7b ss electrode used at the anode was covered with a thin layer of contaminants which were more porous and cracked than the unused ss electrode fig 7a edx analysis were also performed to examine elemental compositions of ss electrode before and after electrochemical treatment the results are shown in table 5 it can be clearly seen that the weight of c n and o elements increased after treatment due to deposition of organic contaminants on ss electrode however the weight of cr mn fe and ni elements decreased after treatment due to the dissolving of the ss anode electrode the morphology of the sludge occurring after electrocoagulation process was observed by the scanning electron microscopy sem technique at 20 000 magnification fig 8 showed that the coagulated pollutants were in the form of bunches of grapes edx analysis were also performed to examine elemental compositions of the sludge after electrochemical treatment the results are shown in table 6 the sludge was mainly composed of c o and s elements which indicated that organic contaminants were coagulated form wastewater s element proved that anionic surfactant such as sodium dodecyl sulfate nacl2h25so4 was also coagulated moreover cr fe and ni elements were observed in the sludge which indicated the dissolving of the ss anode electrode 3 3 integrated electrocoagulation membrane filtration process in this research work the personal care product wastewater was treated using integrated electrocoagulation membrane filtration process the most appropriate operating parameters were ph 4 current density 50 a m2 and duration 180 min by setting necessary constraints in the rsm for electrocoagulation process as a first stage of treatment the cod concentration decreased from 15 930 mg l to 3200 mg l when single stage electrocoagulation process was applied to obtain reusable water ec process was integrated to membrane filtration process uf up150 nf nf270 and nf90 ro bw30 and sw30 membranes were tested in the second study section the final analyzes were carried out for cod and microplastic contents both raw wastewater and ec pretreated samples were passed through up150 membrane at 1 bar of constant pressure fig 9a as can be seen the pretreatment stage was important as the permeate flux obtained by filtrating the pretreated sample was much higher than direct filtrating raw wastewater in addition the membrane was significantly fouled when raw wastewater was filtrated directly due to high amount of organics and solids accumulated on the membrane surface the cumulative permeate volume increased almost 1 5 times after ec pre treatment fig 9b it can be explained as the most of the organic substances in the wastewater were removed in the first stage of treatment therefore organic pollution loading on the membrane was reduced although the uf membrane provided cod reduction however it was not sufficient for water recovery thus two different nf membranes nf270 and nf90 were tested subsequently the results showed that nf270 supplied higher flux but lower cod removal efficiency compared to nf90 membrane fig 10a additional permeate volume is attributed to the larger pore size of nf270 membrane fig 10b again even nf membranes provided better cod removal than uf membrane nf membrane was not effective for water recovery then the performance of two different ro membranes bw30 and sw30 were tested the results showed that sw30 membrane supplied the lowest flux and permeate volume fig 11a and b cod removal efficiency for individual and integrated process are illustrated in table 7 the influent cod of the raw pcp wastewater was 15 930 mg l and it was decreased to 3200 mg l after ec treatment among the tested nf and ro membranes sw30 membrane supplied the lowest cod concentration 130 mg l the obtained cod concentration was judged to be sufficient for water reuse 3 4 microplastic removal many studies have been dedicated for efficiencies determination of a particular treatment methods for microplastics removal while most researches have attention on the removal efficiencies of wastewater treatment plants 46 47 few of them focused on laboratory scale processes 18 19 according to the previous studies it was stated that the removal efficiency of microplastics was relatively low in the tertiary treatment process where important amount of microplastics can be removed after the first step of wastewater treatment process 48 49 electrocoagulation and membrane filtration processes are thought to be an alternative solution 50 in this study microplastic removal efficiency with ec and mf processes were carried out at the optimum operating conditions the final concentration of microplastics was 80 particles l after ec process and completely removed after membrane process fig 12 comparative experimental results of microplastic removal studies found in the literature and results of the current study are summarized in table 8 each polymer type is likely to respond differently to the removal method for example pvc was removed quickly compared to pe removal time by ec process because pvc is more electrochemically responsive to flotation than pe moreover the bubbles formed during the electrocoagulation process cause flotation and polymers removal such as pe which has a lighter density than water however the removal of particles with high density such as ps was not possible by ec process 19 3 5 adsorption kinetics the most appropriate kinetic was selected from the first order second order pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetics model according to the regression coefficient value in order to observe if boundary layer diffusion is affected a log ct c0 vs time curve was plotted the linearity of the calibration curve indicates that the diffusion effect of the boundary layer is high as seen in fig 13a and b 55 adsorption kinetic in the second steps corresponds to the pseudo first order model r2 0 9566 fig 13c from the isotherm study it is possible to obtain the structure of the adsorption layer and the size of the adsorption force 56 therefore langmuir and freundlich isotherms were considered to analyze adsorption experiments as seen in fig 13d the reactions followed langmuir isotherm model that means that the amount of aggregation of molecules covering the solid surface of the adsorbent was realized according to the single molecular layer adsorption theory which was proposed by langmuir 4 conclusions it can be concluded that electrochemical process combined with membrane filtration system has resulted in an efficient methodology for personal care product wastewater treatment for different pollutants removal namely cod surfactant oil and microplastics as pretreatment stage five electrodes al ss fe gr and ti were tested the ss cathode showed the best efficiency for pcp wastewater treatment in the electrochemical process similarly it was proved that reverse osmosis sw30 supplied better water quality improvement in the second stage of the proposed treatment method cod concentration was reduced from 15 930 mg l to 3200 mg l corresponding to 79 91 of removal efficiency when ec was applied moreover ec enhanced to decrease initial concentration of microplastics from 1030 particles l to a final concentration of 80 particles l at ph 4 current density of 50 a cm2 and retention time of 180 min ec membrane integrated process supplied 99 18 of cod removal efficiency with 130 mg l effluent cod concentration treatment of personal care product wastewater is one of the major issues owing to its high cod surfactant oil and microplastic concentration the final suggested combined process has been proved to be significant and effective for personal care product wastewater treatment funding no funding was received for this work declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exists

sw30 the utilization of sw30 membrane has enhanced cod removal efficiency and reached 99 18 and each of surfactant oil grease and microplastic removal efficiencies were enhanced as well the ultimate outcomes displayed the significant ability of the studied combined processes to treat efficiently the tested wastewater and enhanced subsequently its final quality graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anionic surfactant chemical oxygen demand microplastic electrocoagulation personal care products membrane filtration 1 introduction recently with the increase of consumer demand the production amount of personal care products has considerably increased 1 several agencies such as the united states environmental protection agency usepa declared that cosmetic and pharmaceutical products are classified as high polarity pollutants low volatility and continuous pass through wastewater treatment plants 2 with the development of analytical techniques many chemical compounds that were previously undetectable due to their low concentrations nowadays they can be identified in domestic wastewater 3 4 previous research works have already dedicated studies on pharmaceutical field 5 7 however serious problems such as the treatment of wastewater generated during the production of personal care products pcp such as body shampoo facial cleanser toothpaste soap etc remains unsolved 8 in personal care products industry wastewater with high carbon content and toxic compounds is generated 9 several studies have proposed aerobic and anaerobic biological process for pcp wastewater treatment however due to the presence of substances such as detergent oil and grease in wastewater satisfied efficiencies have not been attained 10 11 owing to the high cod loading the energy related of aerobic treatment is quite high and eventually cost is affected for anaerobic treatment process microorganisms producing methane can be inhibited due to oxidants dyes and ammonia containing in the pcp wastewater 9 11 conventional treatment methods are not adequate to effectively purify pcp wastewater from such pollutants matamoras et al 57 studied the elimination capacity of thirteen different secondary pcp wastewater treatment plant systems and determined that the removal efficiencies of most contaminants were limited to 50 in pcp wastewater treatment surfactants are one of the main obstacles which are fronting the treatment process efficiency surfactants use is extremely common in pcp industry and their consumption is estimated to be over 24 million tons in 2022 12 several studies reported that if the sulfonate containing in wastewater is not treated it may cause additional mucus emission which threaten sea biomass lives 13 critical toxicity tests show that lc50 values of anionic surfactants can vary according to the species nature between 110 and 92 000 mg therefore most of the tested surfactants so far have been categorized as harmful and very toxic as published and agreed at the european union directive 67 548 eec 14 for all these reasons it is vital to remove surfactants from wastewater before its disposal to the environment 12 however there are only few studies that investigated their removal simultaneously with other pollutants 15 because of their toxicity and unpreventable spread microplastics are becoming a major global conservation issue personal care products are one of the biggest sources of these microplastics due to the use of microplastics in personal care products they have been excluded in many countries whereas it is still possible to access such products in some other countries among them turkey 16 bioplastics generated from cosmetic industry are representing the dominant source of plastics in sea water passed via sewage systems 17 currently in most wastewater treatment stations microplastics are not among target contaminants to be eliminated though the importance of bioplastics removal only few studies have been published investigating the elimination of those pollutants 15 18 several previous work dealt with the removal of microplastics with the following processes electrocoagulation 19 20 membrane bioreactor 21 and adsorption using carbon nanotubes 22 one of the important wastewater treatment processes is electrocoagulation which has been used to substitute chemical coagulation electrocoagulation is based on cations production by metal electrodes within an electric field 23 electrocoagulation process displayed diverse advantages including not limited to its automation system energy efficiency low cost and the reduction of adsorbent use are among the most important advantages 24 so far integrated or combined processes physical biological and chemical processes such as electrochemical ozone membrane as well as the activated sludge are used extensively to enhance removal efficiency of multiple pollutants containing in wastewater 25 27 a continuous treatment process can be established by integrating a cross flow membrane system with different processes types as reported in many studies 28 the revealed innovation by this study is the evaluation of removing organic matter surfactant and microplastics including treated water recovery and reuse it in system by integrated electrocoagulation and membrane process consequently different electrochemical process parameters were optimized to figure out the best operating conditions namely electrode combination al fe ss gr and ti ph 4 10 current density 50 150 a m2 and retention time 120 240 min then membrane filtration was investigated as a second stage of treatment method where pretreated water derives from ec was considered as effluent ultrafiltration up150 nanofiltration nf270 and nf90 and reverse osmosis bw30 and sw30 membranes were tested for water reuse 2 material and methods 2 1 raw wastewater characterization pcp wastewater was kindly obtained from a firm in mersin turkey samples were collected from the influent wastewater station and kept in the refrigerator at 4 c table 1 summarizes the main wastewater physicochemical characteristics 2 2 integrated reactor setup a lab scale setup of combined electrocoagulation membrane filtration

bar was covered with teflon in order to minimize energy loss the distance between the electrodes was positioned to be 2 cm before each ec experiment the electrodes were dried for 5 min at 105 c then they were kept in acidic solution for 5 min and washed with distilled water all electrodes were weighed to calculate electrode consumption for operating cost after each run after optimization of electrochemical process a cross flow membrane unit was integrated to the system additional cross flow membrane system details are described in a previous study 23 2 3 analytical methods as defined in the rsm experimental design samples at different times were centrifuged with hettich zentrufugeneba20 at 6000 rpm for 5 min h2so4 and naoh 0 1 1n were used to adjust ph using ph cond 340i handheld multi meter wtw analyzes of samples were realized following the standard methods for water and wastewater investigation 29 the standard ec recommendations as well as the earlier studies were used to carry out microplastic particles filtration and analyses 30 31 both raw wastewater and treated water samples were stored in glass bottles to prevent any contact plastic next samples were filtered with 0 45 μm filter paper then the filter was examined under a stereomicroscope nikon smz800n no other analysis was performed except for counting scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss supra 55 germany

second study section the final analyzes were carried out for cod and microplastic contents both raw wastewater and ec pretreated samples were passed through up150 membrane at 1 bar of constant pressure fig 9a as can be seen the pretreatment stage was important as the permeate flux obtained by filtrating the pretreated sample was much higher than direct filtrating raw wastewater in addition the membrane was significantly fouled when raw wastewater was filtrated directly due to high amount of organics and solids accumulated on the membrane surface the cumulative permeate volume increased almost 1 5 times after ec pre treatment fig 9b it can be explained as the most of the organic substances in the wastewater were removed in the first stage of treatment therefore organic pollution loading on the membrane was reduced although the uf membrane provided cod reduction however it was not sufficient for water recovery thus two different nf membranes nf270 and nf90 were tested subsequently the results showed that nf270 supplied higher flux but lower cod removal efficiency compared to nf90 membrane fig 10a additional permeate volume is attributed to the larger pore size of nf270 membrane fig 10b again even nf membranes provided better cod removal than uf membrane nf membrane was not effective for water recovery then the performance of two different ro membranes bw30 and sw30 were tested the results showed that sw30 membrane supplied the lowest flux and permeate volume fig 11a and b cod removal efficiency for individual and integrated process are illustrated in table 7 the influent cod of the raw pcp wastewater was 15 930 mg l and it was decreased to 3200 mg l after ec treatment among the tested nf and ro membranes sw30 membrane supplied the lowest cod concentration 130 mg l the obtained cod concentration was judged to be sufficient for water reuse 3 4 microplastic removal many studies have been dedicated for efficiencies determination of a particular treatment methods for microplastics removal while most researches have attention on the removal efficiencies of wastewater treatment plants 46 47 few of them focused on laboratory scale processes 18 19 according to the previous studies it was stated that the removal efficiency of microplastics was relatively low in the tertiary treatment process where important amount of microplastics can be removed after the first step of wastewater treatment process 48 49 electrocoagulation and membrane filtration processes are thought to be an alternative solution 50 in this study microplastic removal efficiency with ec and mf processes were carried out at the optimum operating conditions the final concentration of microplastics was 80 particles l after ec process and completely removed after membrane process fig 12 comparative experimental results of microplastic removal studies found in the literature and results of the current study are summarized in table 8 each polymer type is likely to respond differently to the removal method for example pvc was removed quickly compared to pe removal time by ec process because pvc is more electrochemically responsive to flotation than pe moreover the bubbles formed during the electrocoagulation process cause flotation and polymers removal such as pe which has a lighter density than water however the removal of particles with high density such as ps was not possible by ec process 19 3 5 adsorption kinetics the most appropriate kinetic was selected from the first order second order pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetics model according to the regression coefficient value in order to observe if boundary layer diffusion is affected a log ct c0 vs time curve was plotted the linearity of the calibration curve indicates that the diffusion effect of the boundary layer is high as seen in fig 13a and b 55 adsorption kinetic in the second steps corresponds to the pseudo first order model r2 0 9566 fig 13c from the isotherm study it is possible to obtain the structure of the adsorption layer and the size of the adsorption force 56 therefore langmuir and freundlich isotherms were considered to analyze adsorption experiments as seen in fig 13d the reactions followed langmuir isotherm model that means that the amount of aggregation of molecules covering the solid surface of the adsorbent was realized according to the single molecular layer adsorption theory which was proposed by langmuir 4 conclusions it can be concluded that electrochemical process combined with membrane filtration system has resulted in an efficient methodology for personal care product wastewater treatment for different pollutants removal namely cod surfactant oil and microplastics as pretreatment stage five electrodes al ss fe gr and ti were tested the ss cathode showed the best efficiency for pcp wastewater treatment in the electrochemical process similarly it was proved that reverse osmosis sw30 supplied better water quality improvement in the second stage of the proposed treatment method cod concentration was reduced from 15 930 mg l to 3200 mg l corresponding to 79 91 of removal efficiency when ec was applied moreover ec enhanced to decrease initial concentration of microplastics from 1030 particles l to a final concentration of 80 particles l at ph 4 current density of 50 a cm2 and retention time of 180 min ec membrane integrated process supplied 99 18 of cod removal efficiency with 130 mg l effluent cod concentration treatment of personal care product wastewater is one of the major issues owing to its high cod surfactant oil and microplastic concentration the final suggested combined process has been proved to be significant and effective for personal care product

bioelectricity 8 10 chlorella vulgaris has already been tested in mfc with a high organic load showing excellent results for bioelectricity production bioremediation and lipid production 11 desmodesmus subspicatus is known to efficiently recover nutrients from wastewater through mixotrophic pathways 8 whereas pseudokirchneriella subcapitata yields high amounts of lipids 12 and removes emergent contaminants in wastewater 13 these features can be exploited to improve mmfcs and microalgae species isolated from local wastewater are great candidates the bacteria species in the mmfcs are also essential and were the first documented microorganisms to show a bioelectrochemical response from the decomposition of organic 14 15 since then research on bioelectricity generation has been growing and escherichia coli is one of the bacteria widely used in experiments with bes due to its bioelectrogenic potential 16 17 pseudomonas aeruginosa application and its ability to produce electrons are still being studied 18 the bacterial axenic culture associated with microalgal monocultures can be a promising combination to mmfc with bioelectricity remediation and biomass generation with several applications 19 21 in the literature mfcs were planned with active sludge or pure cultures bacterial pure culture produced five times more bioelectricity than active sludge 22 23 using pure cultures in each chamber of a system that can improve the process is relevant to bioelectricity and biomass exploitation according to huarachi olivera et al 24 microalgae can be used in the cathodic chamber and bacteria in the anodic chamber therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of an mmfc to generate bioelectricity and treat wastewater using bacteria in the anodic and microalgae in the cathodic chamber the bacteria used were e coli atcc 25922 and p aeruginosa atcc 27853 and microalgae were d subspicatus r chodat e hegewald a schmidt chlorophyceae and p subcapitata korshikov f hindák chlorophyceae the microalgae can be isolated from a university sanitary wastewater and are strong candidates to be used in low salt effluents 2 methodology 2 1 system development the mmfc systems were built at a bench scale with three combinations of microalgae and bacteria in two separate chambers 14 cm height x 6 cm diameter as shown in table 1 the study was conducted in triplicate and monitored for 7 days using graphite electrodes grafites sulamerica 10 1 0 0 2 cm electrodes were previously submerged in deionized water for 24 h to remove any particles on their surface the mmfc system was operated at room temperature 22 24 c for 7 days the initial anolyte and catholyte phs were approximately 7 0 cathodic chambers were kept under artificial light and anodic chambers were kept in the dark during the entire experiment the equipment fig 1 was adapted from huarachi olivera et al 24 using a 300 ml glass chamber and a 1 300 ml reservoir added for synthetic wastewater sw recirculation after coupling the anodic chamber electrodes were inserted into the lids and connected by copper wires to conduct the released electrons air was bubbled through the cathode lid to decrease the concentration of the accumulated dissolved oxygen 25 autoclaved tubes with 0 22 μm filter and porous stone were coupled to an air pump baoke and the two chambers were connected by a hydrogen exchange membrane nafion nr212 secured with a silicone ring membrane activation was performed by acid pretreatment 26 a submerged pump 180 l h 1 maximum flow was connected to the anodic chamber using a tecalon hose mantova and coupled airlock to the cathodic chamber lid the chambers were operated in fed batch mode we used photosynthetic organisms in the cathodic chambers and bacteria in the anodic chamber the monocultures of d subspicatus and p subcapitata were previously grown in npk media 12 11 18 sw npk medium 80 20 v v was used in all the experiments axenic bacterial inoculums of e coli and p aeruginosa were cultivated in brain heart infusion bhi oxoid all strains were inoculated in sw bhi 80 20 v v medium for adaptation 2 2 wastewater composition synthetic wastewater sw was used to control and mimic the composition of urban wastewater 27 for the experiments table 2 the main components of sw are casein peptone and meat extract which promote bacteria growth in the medium and carbon nitrogen and phosphorus compounds the sw is an urban wastewater characterized mainly by nitrogen and phosphorus from urine and domestic chemical products 28 the sw was adjusted with 5 h3po4 to have a ph of 6 0 and autoclaved for 15 min 121 c at 1 atm the total medium volume in the anode chamber was 1200 ml 960 ml sw 240 ml bacterial inoculum in the cathode chamber it was 300 ml 240 ml sw 60 ml microalgae inoculum 2 3 ph and biomass determination the chambers were monitored at the beginning and end of each experiment using a phmeter mehtrom biomass production was determined after sample filtration with glass fiber filters 47 mm d i macherey nagel gf 2 and oven dried with air circulation at 50 c for 12 h adapted from oliveira et al 29 2 4 total phosphorus tp total organic carbon toc total inorganic carbon tic and total nitrogen tn determination the smeww 4500 pe 30 method was used to measure the presence of tp in the effluent samples of both chambers toc tic and tn were simultaneously analyzed in an elemental analyzer toc tn shimadzu all samples were previously filtrated by a 0 45 μm filter and diluted with ultrapure water standard curves were prepared with 500 mg l 1 of nahco3 and na2co3 for tic khc8h4o4 for toc and kno3 for tn determination all reagents were p a merck data were analyzed via the t test with p 0 05 using the prism software 8 4 6 2 5 electrical potential determination the electric potential difference mv between the anode and cathode electrodes was recorded with a digital multimeter dt 830b from the third day of operation exponential phase of microalgae growth the microalgal growth curves were obtained previously the electric current was measured in the mmfcs for 2 h on the fifth day using a multimeter with 25 ω resistivity agilent the fifth day was a day into the exponential phase 3 results and discussion 3 1 ph determination the ph influences the microalgal biofilm growth around the electrode reacting via oxireduction on the cathode 6 elmaadawy et al 31 described that the microalgae biofilm improved the microbial fuel cell because of the potential to recover nutrient generate electric current and yield biomass the average ph values of all mmfcs on days 0 and 7 of the operating system are shown in fig 2 there was no significant difference in ph between the two mmfc 2 chambers p 0 05 a significant increase at the end of the experiment was identified in both chambers for all the combinations huarachi olivera et al 24 observed a similar trend in their experiments and that the changes in the redox state and acid contents impacted the ph in both chambers it was found alkaline ph values in the catholyte due to oh formation despite the existence of hydrogen ions diffused through the membrane from the anolyte in the cathode in optimized conditions there is o2 reduction due to the availability of electrons and hydrogen ions resulting mainly in h2o formation electric potential difference and intermediate products h2o2 when the hydrogen ion migration from the anode chamber to the cathode chamber slows the hydroxyl anions formation is more visible 32 in most bioeletrochemical processes the o2 reduction is in circumneutral conditions enabled by h and oh concentrations 33 according to elshobary et al 7 the ph difference between the chambers is expected in the anodic chamber the fermentation process tends to lower the ph returning to around ph 7 because of the migration of hydrogen ions to the cathodic chamber all ph values were within the range considered ideal for the development of microorganisms and the ph variation was expected for this system since there was no buffer in the medium to avoid ph variation in the cathode phosphate buffer is generally used 34 35 shukla et al 36 showed that a neutral ph 6 8 is ideal for an excellent mfcs performance 3 2 bioelectrogenesis the voltage mv obtained in this study fig 3 showed that mmfc 1 had a higher potential difference 560 mv in 7 days than mmfc 2 and 3 the experiments in mmfc 2 and 3 had maximum values of 447 and 351 mv on day 4 respectively after that the voltage values declined in the mmfc 3 system opposite to mmfc 2 according to the thickness of the bacterial biofilm on the anodic surface increases the potential difference with electroactive enrichment in all the systems the combinations between microorganisms were different affecting biofilm formation 34 this result suggests the mmfc1 system as a promising bioelectricity production in most previous studies the electrical potential difference was similar or lower even in conditions with a higher organic load in the cathode chamber with c vulgaris the measured voltage was lower 11 christwardana et al 6 reported that mmfc systems generate 2 38 times more bioelectricity than mfc systems zhu et al 37 presented a study using an mfc with a cyanobacteria solution 100 to 200 h reaching 530 560 mv as maximum voltage generation using a microbial consortium in an analogous study using synechococcus sp and chlorococcum sp a maximum electric potential of 590 20 mv was reached on the 3rd day of treatment 38 huarachi olivera et al 24 found a maximum electric potential of 954 mv using industrial wastewater as a carbon source they found better results which are justified by the electron transfer rate a product of the electrochemical behavior of the bioanode and a consequence of the metabolism of the bacteria present in the biofilm overall the potential difference declines with time due to the decrease in the activity of microorganisms venkata mohan et al 39 explained that when using a mixed microflora in their mfc the bioelectrogenesis depended on the carbon source used by the bacteria in the anode and the microalgae biofilm formation in the cathode which are variables associated with wastewater nutrients nutritional conditions are indispensable to maintaining carbon uptake for example bacteria under n starvation as in the case of e coli can have their cell cycle ceased this generates a metabolic imbalance decreases their translation rate and reduces carbon uptake 40 consequently influencing bioelectrogenesis the electrical current measurement with 25 ω resistance in the mmfc 1 was 0 2 ma corresponding to a current density of 81 97 ma m 2 these results are similar to those obtained by hadiyanto et al 41 with immobilized yeast in the anode and spirulina sp in the cathode statistical analysis showed a significant difference in the voltage generation of mmfc 1 compared to systems 1 and 2 p 0 05 according to venkata mohan et al 42 the gradual degradation of the nutrients in the substrate can produce electrons and a hydrogen ion current to maintain the potential difference for extended periods with oxygen as a final electron acceptor and the rapid metabolic activities in the cathodic chamber the stimulus for the diffusion of h contributed to the electrical current therefore electron transfer depends on the bioelectrochemical behavior of the involved microorganisms 24 the mmfc 1 composed of the bacterium e coli and the microalgae d subspicatus was more efficient in bioelectricity generation than the other combinations in this sense assessing different microalgae microbial combinations is an efficient tool to develop beneficial microbial consortia 3 3 bacteria and microalgae biomass fig 4 shows the mean values of bacterial and microalgal biomass in combinations mmfc 1 to 3 there was no significant difference in the bacterial or microalgal biomass p 0 05 in each chamber for all microorganism combinations the experimental results show that the electrical potential produced in the mmfc system is related to the biomass produced in the anode and cathode a significantly higher electric potential difference produced per biomass when d subspicatus is in the cathode and e coli is in the anode chamber p 0 05 since the medium was the same the importance of the metabolism of each species is observed enabling substrate oxidation in the anode and oxygen reduction in the cathode chamber thus it is observed that bioelectricity depends on the substrate conversion ratio in the anode and the photosynthesis in the cathode chamber which is directly related to the growth of the species involved in the mmfc1 the two species involved showed growth rates more suitable to act together in forming an electron current factors related to the equipment design and nutrients could further improve the efficiency of this microorganism combination such as the composition and size of the electrodes aeration systems in the cathode and recirculation in the anode chamber among others 43 44 these results showed the applicability of the d subspicatus with e coli to produce bioenergy in mmfcs mmfc can be used to treat wastewater simultaneously and accumulate several essential metabolites such as carotenoids and fatty acids in the biomass and generate bioelectricity 45 therefore photo bioelectrochemical systems are promising to yield biomass 3 4 bioremediation the tp tn toc and tic removal efficiencies are shown in table 3 the best removal results were found in the cathodic chambers with the two microalgae tested the highest values of tp removal from the sw found in 7 days of cultivation were with e coli and p subcapitata mmfc 3 in 43 0 and 55 5 of p removal respectively the maximum p removal efficiency was 76 4 when the treatment was in the mmfc 3 after 7 days p 0 05 regarding the mmfc 1 and 2 there was no significant difference among the tp concentrations fig 5 shows the tp concentrations found in the three systems the synergy between bacteria and microalgae can influence the bioremediation process due to the ability of bacteria to degrade organic matter and generate h ions which are captured by microalgae 46 regarding tp remediation the mmfc 3 system was significantly different from mmfc 1 the systems mmfc 1 and mmfc 3 had the same bacteria e coli but different microalgae d subspicatus and p subcapitata respectively xiao et al 9 used green algae to remove phosphorus in an integrated photoelectrochemical ipb system obtaining an 82 3 overall phosphorus removal over 360 days of operation 27 in the anodic compartment and 55 in the cathodic chamber ge et al 47 showed a phosphorus removal of 91 2 after180 days of operation with a microbial community these studies show that time is an essential factor influencing phosphorus removal multiple factors influence the intra extracellular phosphorus flux interfering in the tp concentration as ph iron magnesium or aluminum impacts phosphates formation 48 in our study the metals were not responsible for tp removal using sw the nutrient concentration in the sw could influence the bioelectrogenesis process according to huang et al 49 the use of c vulgaris to remove phosphorous showed that the n and p relationship was crucial for microalgae growth and p removal from the medium nitrogen deficiency in wastewater can inhibit microalgal growth and lead to incomplete nutrient removal the authors highlighted that no3 addition enhanced wastewater phosphorus removal there were no significant differences in tn concentration in the chambers in our experiments although in mmfcs nitrogen removal from several substrates is commonly reported 9 50 51 we observed an increased tn concentration in the bacterial chambers fig 5 temperature seems to be a variable that influences nitrogen removal when comparing our results to previous studies zhang et al 52 showed that the removal of pollutants and electricity generation were facilitated at 30 c they obtained a tn removal rate of 10 0 1 3 g n m 3 d 1 kakarla et al 51 obtained a higher n removal 99 6 at 27 c in our experiment the room temperature was controlled 20 c 24 c avoiding the effect of temperature variation frequent in outdoor experiments 32 processes such as ammonification or denitrification are responsible for tn removal but denitrification and the simultaneous transformation of organic nitrogen into ammonia interfere in the system removal performance 53 regarding carbon removal in the mmfcs we obtained a toc reduction in all the systems anodic and cathodic chambers still only microalgae presented significant differences p 0 05 among the three combinations fig 5 and our results suggest that the microalgae d subspicatus and p subcapitata can efficiently reduce organic matter levels in 7 days the best organic carbon removal efficiency reached 72 4 when the treatment was with d subspicatus and the average removal efficiencies were between 52 and 65 with the microalgae d subspicatus or p subcapitata treatment with e coli we obtained up to 63 of organic carbon removal and the average removal efficiencies with bacteria treatment e coli or p aeruginosa were between 16 and 56 interestingly studies using c vulgaris with sw observed autotrophic metabolism at the initial stage and heterotrophic metabolism at the final stage 10 kokabian et al 54 used c vulgaris in the cathode and obtained an organic carbon removal of 45 6 the use of biocathodes bacterial and microalgal in pbes has the advantage that they can be used in both chambers anode and cathode for simultaneous treatment under different conditions further facilitating organic pollutant removal 42 song et al 55 obtained a 37 2 efficiency when removing organic matter after 16 days of treatment suggesting that a longer operating time of the mmfc system promotes toc removal in our study regarding the inorganic carbon concentration there was a significant increase p 0 05 in the anode chambers in all the mmfcs which can be explained by the bacterial decomposition of organic matter releasing co2 fig 5 the inorganic carbon available to microorganisms will depend on the ph of the culture medium affecting the photosynthetic activity of microalgae due to the assimilation of organic carbon which increases the ph 54 the reduction of h in the culture medium inevitably leads to increased ph and available inorganic carbon in the medium 46 microalgae store co2 through the calvin benson cycle and a redox reaction that involves the conversion of co2 into carbohydrates here dissolved inorganic carbon as a carbon source can be used 38 the operation time can also impact the tic levels in a previous study c vulgaris took up to 20 days to decrease the ic concentration in the system 55 known sources of ic in the medium are diffusion from the atmosphere into the water decomposition of organic matter and respiration of organisms it is present in water in the form of co2 hco3 and co3 2 31 the availability of co2 artificially inserted through mechanical aeration in the cathode chamber or formed during biodegradation of organic material by bacteria in the anode chamber can increase inorganic carbon concentration 4 conclusions the mmfc system showed that the strains selected have the potential to generate bioelectricity the combination of the mmfc systems composed of the bacteria e coli and the microalgae d subspicatus mmfc1 reached higher voltage levels after 7 days all the mmfcs removed nutrients from the sw therefore the results were promising for the three combinations evaluated for the nutrient bioremediation mainly microalgae the combination of mmfc 3 was the most efficient thus using an mmfc to generate bioelectricity and bioremediate wastewater is a sustainable and environmentally friendly technology to treat wastewater and produce bioenergy declaration of competing

the sw was adjusted with 5 h3po4 to have a ph of 6 0 and autoclaved for 15 min 121 c at 1 atm the total medium volume in the anode chamber was 1200 ml 960 ml sw 240 ml bacterial inoculum in the cathode chamber it was 300 ml 240 ml sw 60 ml microalgae inoculum 2 3 ph and biomass determination the chambers were monitored at the beginning and end of each experiment using a phmeter mehtrom biomass production was determined after sample filtration with glass fiber filters 47 mm d i macherey nagel gf 2 and oven dried with air circulation at 50 c for 12 h adapted from oliveira et al 29 2 4 total phosphorus tp total organic carbon toc total inorganic carbon tic and total nitrogen tn determination the smeww 4500 pe 30 method was used to measure the presence of tp in the effluent samples of both chambers toc tic and tn were simultaneously analyzed in an elemental analyzer toc tn shimadzu all samples were previously filtrated by a 0 45 μm filter and diluted with ultrapure water standard curves were prepared with 500 mg l 1 of nahco3 and na2co3 for tic khc8h4o4 for toc and kno3 for tn determination all reagents were p a merck data were analyzed via the t test with p 0 05 using the prism software 8 4 6 2 5 electrical potential determination the electric potential difference mv between the anode and cathode electrodes was recorded with a digital multimeter dt 830b from the third day of operation exponential phase of microalgae growth the microalgal growth curves were obtained previously the electric current was measured in the mmfcs for 2 h on the fifth day using a multimeter with 25 ω resistivity agilent the fifth day was a day into the exponential phase 3 results and discussion 3 1 ph determination the ph influences the microalgal biofilm growth around the electrode reacting via oxireduction on the cathode 6 elmaadawy et al 31 described that the microalgae biofilm improved the microbial fuel cell because of the potential to recover nutrient generate electric current and yield biomass the average ph values of all mmfcs on days 0 and 7 of the operating system are shown in fig 2 there was no significant difference in ph between the two mmfc 2 chambers p 0 05 a significant increase at the end of the experiment was identified in both chambers for all the combinations huarachi olivera et al 24 observed a similar trend in their experiments and that the changes in the redox state and acid contents impacted the ph in both chambers it was found alkaline ph values in the catholyte due to oh formation despite the existence of hydrogen ions diffused through the membrane from the anolyte in the cathode in optimized conditions there is o2 reduction due to the availability of electrons and hydrogen ions resulting mainly in h2o formation electric potential difference and intermediate products h2o2 when the hydrogen ion migration from the anode chamber to the cathode chamber slows the hydroxyl anions formation is more visible 32 in most bioeletrochemical processes the o2 reduction is in circumneutral conditions enabled by h and oh concentrations 33 according to elshobary et al 7 the ph difference between the chambers is expected in the anodic chamber the fermentation process tends to lower the ph returning to around ph 7 because of the migration of hydrogen ions to the cathodic chamber all ph values were within the range considered ideal for the development of microorganisms and the ph variation was expected for this system since there was no buffer in the medium to avoid ph variation in the cathode phosphate buffer is generally used 34 35 shukla et al 36 showed that a neutral ph 6 8 is ideal for an excellent mfcs performance 3 2 bioelectrogenesis the voltage mv obtained in this study fig 3 showed that mmfc 1 had a higher potential difference 560 mv in 7 days than mmfc 2 and 3 the experiments in mmfc 2 and 3 had maximum values of 447 and 351 mv on day 4 respectively after that the voltage values declined in the mmfc 3 system opposite to mmfc 2 according to the thickness of the bacterial biofilm on the anodic surface increases the potential difference with electroactive enrichment in all the systems the combinations between microorganisms were different affecting biofilm formation 34 this result suggests the mmfc1 system as a promising bioelectricity production in most previous studies the electrical potential difference was similar or lower even in conditions with a higher organic load in the cathode chamber with c vulgaris the measured voltage was lower 11 christwardana et al 6 reported that mmfc systems generate 2 38 times more bioelectricity than mfc systems zhu et al 37 presented a study using an mfc with a cyanobacteria solution 100 to 200 h reaching 530 560 mv as maximum voltage generation using a microbial consortium in an analogous study using synechococcus sp and chlorococcum sp a maximum electric potential of 590 20 mv was reached on the 3rd day of treatment 38 huarachi olivera et al 24 found a maximum electric potential of 954 mv using industrial wastewater as a carbon source they found better results which are justified by the electron transfer rate a product of the electrochemical behavior of the bioanode and a consequence of the metabolism of the bacteria present in the biofilm overall the potential difference declines with time due to the decrease in the activity of microorganisms venkata mohan et al 39 explained that when using a mixed microflora in their mfc the bioelectrogenesis depended on the carbon source used by the bacteria in the anode and the microalgae biofilm formation in the cathode which are variables associated with wastewater nutrients nutritional conditions are indispensable to maintaining carbon uptake for example bacteria under n starvation as in the case of e coli can have their cell cycle ceased this generates a metabolic imbalance decreases their translation rate and reduces carbon uptake 40 consequently influencing bioelectrogenesis the electrical current measurement with 25 ω resistance in the mmfc 1 was 0 2 ma corresponding to a current density of 81 97 ma m 2 these results are similar to those obtained by hadiyanto et al 41 with immobilized yeast in the anode and spirulina sp in the cathode statistical analysis showed a significant difference in the voltage generation of mmfc 1 compared to systems 1 and 2 p 0 05 according to venkata mohan et al 42 the gradual degradation of the nutrients in the substrate can produce electrons and a hydrogen ion current to maintain the potential difference for extended periods with oxygen as a final electron acceptor and the rapid metabolic activities in the cathodic chamber the stimulus for the diffusion of h contributed to the electrical current therefore electron transfer depends on the bioelectrochemical behavior of the involved microorganisms 24 the mmfc 1 composed of the bacterium e coli and the microalgae d subspicatus was more efficient in bioelectricity generation than the other combinations in this sense assessing different microalgae microbial combinations is an efficient tool to develop beneficial microbial consortia 3 3 bacteria and microalgae biomass fig 4 shows the mean values of bacterial and microalgal biomass in combinations mmfc 1 to 3 there was no significant difference in the bacterial or microalgal biomass p 0 05 in each chamber for all microorganism combinations the experimental results show that the electrical potential produced in the mmfc system is related to the biomass produced in the anode and cathode a significantly higher electric potential difference produced per biomass when d subspicatus is in the cathode and e coli is in the anode chamber p 0 05 since the medium was the same the importance of the metabolism of each species is observed enabling substrate oxidation in the anode and oxygen reduction in the cathode chamber thus it is observed that bioelectricity depends on the substrate conversion ratio in the anode and the photosynthesis in the cathode chamber which is directly related to the growth of the species involved in the mmfc1 the two species involved showed growth rates more suitable to act together in forming an electron current factors related to the equipment design and nutrients could further improve the efficiency of this microorganism combination such as the composition and size of the electrodes aeration systems in the cathode and recirculation in the anode chamber among others 43 44 these results showed the applicability of the d subspicatus with e coli to produce bioenergy in mmfcs mmfc can be used to treat wastewater simultaneously and accumulate several essential metabolites such as carotenoids and fatty acids in the biomass and generate bioelectricity 45 therefore photo bioelectrochemical systems are promising to yield biomass 3 4 bioremediation the tp tn toc and tic removal efficiencies are shown in table 3 the best removal results were found in the cathodic chambers with the two microalgae tested the highest values of tp removal from the sw found in 7 days of cultivation were with e coli and p subcapitata mmfc 3 in 43 0 and 55 5 of p removal respectively the maximum p removal efficiency was 76 4 when the treatment was in the mmfc 3 after 7 days p 0 05 regarding the mmfc 1 and 2 there was no significant difference among the tp concentrations fig 5 shows the tp concentrations found in the three systems the synergy between bacteria and microalgae can influence the bioremediation process due to the ability of bacteria to degrade organic matter and generate h ions which are captured by microalgae 46 regarding tp remediation the mmfc 3 system was significantly different from mmfc 1 the systems mmfc 1 and mmfc 3 had the same bacteria e coli but different microalgae d subspicatus and p subcapitata respectively xiao et al 9 used green algae to remove phosphorus in an integrated photoelectrochemical ipb system obtaining an 82 3 overall phosphorus removal over 360 days of operation 27 in the anodic compartment and 55 in the cathodic chamber ge et al 47 showed a phosphorus removal of 91 2 after180 days of operation with a microbial community these studies show that time is an essential factor influencing phosphorus removal multiple factors influence the intra extracellular phosphorus flux interfering in the tp concentration as ph iron magnesium or aluminum impacts phosphates formation 48 in our study the metals were not responsible for tp removal using sw the nutrient concentration in the sw could influence the bioelectrogenesis process according to huang et al 49 the use of c vulgaris to remove phosphorous showed that the n and p relationship was crucial for microalgae growth and p removal from the medium nitrogen deficiency in wastewater can inhibit microalgal growth and lead to incomplete nutrient removal the authors highlighted that no3 addition enhanced wastewater phosphorus removal there were no significant differences in tn concentration in the chambers in our experiments although in mmfcs nitrogen removal from several substrates is commonly reported 9 50 51 we observed an increased tn concentration in the bacterial chambers fig 5 temperature seems to be a variable that influences nitrogen removal when comparing our results to previous studies zhang et al 52 showed that the removal of pollutants and electricity generation were facilitated at 30 c they obtained a tn removal rate of 10 0 1 3 g n m 3 d 1 kakarla et al 51 obtained a higher n removal 99 6 at 27 c in our experiment the room temperature was controlled 20 c 24 c avoiding the effect of temperature variation frequent in outdoor experiments 32 processes such as ammonification or denitrification are responsible for tn removal but denitrification and the simultaneous transformation of organic nitrogen into ammonia interfere in the system removal performance 53 regarding carbon removal in the mmfcs we obtained a toc reduction in all the systems anodic and cathodic chambers still only microalgae presented significant differences p 0 05 among the three combinations fig 5 and our results suggest that the microalgae d subspicatus and p subcapitata can efficiently reduce organic matter levels in 7 days the best organic carbon removal efficiency reached 72 4 when the treatment was with d subspicatus and the average removal efficiencies were between 52 and 65 with the microalgae d subspicatus or p subcapitata treatment with e coli we obtained up to 63 of organic carbon removal and the average removal efficiencies with bacteria treatment e coli or p aeruginosa were between 16 and 56 interestingly studies using c vulgaris with sw observed autotrophic metabolism at the initial stage and heterotrophic metabolism at the final stage 10 kokabian et al 54 used c vulgaris in the cathode and obtained an organic carbon removal of 45 6 the use of biocathodes bacterial and microalgal in pbes has the advantage that they can be used in both chambers anode and cathode for simultaneous treatment under different conditions further facilitating organic pollutant removal 42 song et al 55 obtained a 37 2 efficiency when removing organic matter after 16 days of treatment suggesting that a longer operating time of the mmfc system promotes toc removal in our study regarding the inorganic carbon concentration there was a significant increase p 0 05 in the anode chambers in all the mmfcs which can be explained by the bacterial decomposition of organic matter releasing co2 fig 5 the inorganic carbon available to microorganisms will depend on the ph of the culture medium affecting the photosynthetic activity of microalgae due to the assimilation of organic carbon which increases the ph 54 the reduction of h in the culture medium inevitably leads to increased ph and available inorganic carbon in the medium 46 microalgae store co2 through the calvin benson cycle and a redox reaction that involves the conversion of co2 into carbohydrates here dissolved inorganic carbon as a carbon source can be used 38 the operation time can also impact the tic levels in a previous study c vulgaris took up to 20 days to decrease the ic concentration in the system 55 known sources of ic in the medium are diffusion from the atmosphere into the water decomposition of organic matter and respiration of organisms it is present in water in the form of co2 hco3 and co3 2 31 the availability of co2 artificially inserted through mechanical aeration in the cathode chamber or formed during biodegradation of organic material by bacteria in the anode chamber can increase inorganic carbon concentration 4 conclusions the mmfc system showed that the strains selected have the potential to generate bioelectricity the combination of the mmfc systems composed of the bacteria e coli and the microalgae d subspicatus mmfc1 reached higher voltage levels after 7 days all the mmfcs removed nutrients from the sw therefore the results were promising for the three combinations evaluated for the nutrient bioremediation mainly microalgae the combination of mmfc 3 was the most efficient thus using an mmfc to generate bioelectricity and bioremediate wastewater is a sustainable and environmentally friendly technology to treat wastewater and produce bioenergy declaration of competing

12933,volatile organic compounds vocs are highly volatile in nature and cause significant air pollution in the environment it is copiously present in evaporate condensate wastewater ecww released by the pharmaceutical industry and can escape into the atmosphere during conventional aerobic wastewater treatment this study describes the preparation of molybdenum impregnated nanoporous carbon silica matrix moncsm and its efficiency toward catalytic oxidation of vocs present in ecww it also focuses on the oxidation of the non vocs present in ecww after vocs removal the moncsm was characterised by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy which confirmed the sharp peaks in the region 800 600 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibrations of mo o mo the x ray diffraction spectrum of moncsm showed 2θ values of 26 38 57 31 2 for moo2 and 40 06 for moo3 the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum showed the presence of free electrons in moncsm at a g factor of 2 011 the ecww possessed chemical oxygen demand cod of 210 000 240 000 mg l 1 in which 90 92 account for vocs the vocs were separated from ecww and catalytically oxidised using moncsm catalyst it showed a removal efficiency of 84 8 2 3 in terms of total organic carbon toc in 20 treatment cycles the remaining non vocs containing ecww were treated by advanced oxidation processes using sequential packed bed and fluidised bed reactors its overall removal efficiency was cod 98 78 biochemical oxygen demand 98 54 toc 99 46 total kjeldahl nitrogen 78 2 and nh4 n 95 respectively the catalytic oxidation of vocs present in ecww was confirmed using toc analysis and high performance liquid chromatography graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords volatile organic compounds catalytic oxidation molybdenum nanoporous carbon silica matrix pharmaceutical effluent 1 introduction volatile organic compounds vocs are profusely present in the atmosphere it undergoes the reaction in the presence of sunlight forming ground level ozone photochemical smog and ozone depletion which are detrimental to the ecosystem vocs have adverse effects of short and long term health complications on both human animal beings and most of the vocs are identified as human carcinogens 1 pharmaceutical industries mainly use inorganic salts and organic solvents in their processes resulting in high total dissolved solids tds and high voc containing wastewater 2 4 generally the multiple effect evaporator is used to treat pharma wastewater in which the high tds is retained in concentrate the evaporated liquid is condensed with organic compounds called evaporate condensate wastewater ecww 5 the ecww is alkaline and contains high chemical oxygen demand cod 210 000 240 000 mg l 1 and total organic carbon toc 52 000 56 980 mg l 1 due to the high organic pollution load vocs and non vocs conventionally the ecww is treated in an aerobic open wastewater treatment system leading to the volatilisation of vocs into the atmosphere and causing air pollution 6 it is not possible to collectively treat all the organic pollution present in ecww with a single treatment technique various methods for vocs removal in wastewater were attempted including bio filtration catalytic photocatalytic and thermal oxidation etc though biofiltration is the most commonly used technology to reduce voc emission it has the major disadvantages of the presence of ammonia in effluent which affects the efficiency of bio filters formation of clogging a large amount of biofilm accumulation biomass generation high investment cost and maintaining crucial biological conditions 7 the catalytic oxidation method is considered the most effective method as it completely destructs vocs 8 the thermal oxidation in the gas phase at a temperature of 250 500 c has been attempted by many researchers 9 13 but the gas phase treatment method at the field scale level has limitations of high cost high energy input and operation difficulties 14 the catalytic oxidation of vocs in the liquid phase at ambient conditions is considered economically feasible low cost and highly efficient than gas phase oxidation but it requires the most efficient catalyst to perform hence there is continuous research on the preparation of efficient catalysts to oxidise vocs present in pharmaceutical wastewater includes lots of challenges due to the complexity of wastewater the molybdenum containing catalyst possesses high selectivity toward vocs such as benzene chloro compounds toluene and cyclohexane 15 16 though the molybdenum is selective toward vocs it can t be applied directly as a homogeneous catalyst because of the difficulty to recover in treated water it results in a low life of the catalyst to overcome this problem carbon matrix is used as a supporting medium carbon supported matrices are one of the easier matrices to recover transition metals from the spent or unused catalyst the manuscript describes the holistic approach to effectively treat vocs and non vocs present in the ecww separately to avoid air pollution and for effective reuse of treated water this research article also describes the preparation and characterization of molybdenum impregnated nanoporous carbon silica matrix moncsm from the agricultural waste of rice husk for effective catalytic oxidation of vocs via organic alcohols as intermediates this proposed scheme addresses the treatment of ecww without the emission of high vocs in the surrounding environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the molybdenum v chloride 99 99 used in this study was bought from alfa aesar chemicals all other chemicals used in this study were analytical grade bought from s d fine chem limited 2 2 collection of ecww and characterization the vocs containing ecww were received from a

chromatography hplc shimadzu with a pda detector spd m20a analytical flow cell c18 column a mobile phase of methanol and water 80 20 in the flow rate of 1 ml min the shimadzu ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2600 was used to identify and confirm the oxidation of vocs the shimadzu toc l rohs analyser was used to analyse toc present in the water the electrospray ionisation mass spectroscopy esi ms was analysed using waters make and xevotqd 2000 model for the voc contaminated water and treated voc water 2 3 preparation and characterization of molybdenum impregnated nanoporous carbon silica matrix moncsm the moncsm catalyst was prepared from the rice husk by soaking the molybdenum chloride solution onto the rice husk overnight then the metal soaked husk was dried in a hot air oven at 110 c until completely dry and then it was pre carbonised at 400 c for 4 h at a heating rate of 5 c min 1 the pre carbonised catalyst was subjected to activation by mixing well with phosphoric acid and then activated at 700 c for 1 h at a heating rate of 5 c min 1 after cooling it was labelled as moncsm the plain nanoporous carbon silica matrix ncsm was prepared side by side without adding molybdenum to the husk by following the procedure reported by maharaja et al 18 the moncsm and ncsm were analysed by powder x ray diffraction xrd using rich siefert 3000 diffractometer at 4 deg min 1 scanning in the range of 5 80 deg operated at 30kv and 15 ma with step sampling of 0 005 deg the perkin elmer make of fourier transform infrared ftir spectrophotometer was used to analyse functional groups present in moncsm and ncsm the sample was pelletised using spectroscopic grade kbr merk darmstadt germany to a thickness of 1 mm and diameter of 13 mm using the piston of a hydraulic pump by giving a pressure of 15 kpa cm 2 ftir spectrum was obtained by scanning in the range of 4000 to 400 cm 1 over five scans the thermogravimetric analysis tga was recorded from ambient temperature to 800 c with a heating rate of 10 c min 1 under a nitrogen atmosphere using q50 v20 6 build 31 the differential scanning calorimetric dsc was analysed from 30 c to 300 c using q200 v23 10 build 79 at a temperature gradient of 10 c the diffuse reflectance spectra drs was obtained using shimadzu uv visible scanning spectrophotometer to the powdered catalyst the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area was analysed to moncsm catalyst by adsorption of nitrogen gas at 77 5 k using asap 2020 v4 03 v4 03h analyser the mo loading in moncsm was confirmed by icp analysis for which the catalyst was converted into ash and then acid digestion was done for analysis the values are presented in table 1 2 4 treatment of ecww wastewater the holistic scheme for treating vocs and non vocs separately present in ecww is shown in fig 1 the ecww was stripped out in the stripper reactor using atmospheric air at 1 liter per minute lpm the stripped out vocs were dissolved in the distilled water at b2 in a 1 5 ratio at optimised conditions after condensing moisture in b1 it was found that 91 92 of vocs were redissolved contaminated in water then it was catalytically oxidised in the catalytic reactor cr after stripping vocs in the ecww by stripper reactor the stripper residue of non vocs containing water was further treated by catalytic oxidation methods at optimum conditions 2 4 1 catalytic oxidation of vocs present in evaporate condensate wastewater two similar cr were fabricated using an acrylic sheet as shown in fig s1 with a total volume of 500 ml and a working volume of 250 ml with dimensions of a diameter of 4 cm and height of 40 cm the cr bottom was packed with coarse quartz aggregate of 5 mm up to 2 cm height followed by packing of fine 3 mm aggregate up to 3 cm height then catalysts of ncsm cr ncsm and moncsm cr moncsm were packed with a height of 20 cm and the total height of the bed was 25 cm the vocs contaminated water was sprinkled on top of the reactor with an optimised dosage of h2o2 and the treated water was collected from the bottom for analysis the optimisation studies such as ph time and different airflow rates by lpm were studied for treatability 2 4 2 treatment of non voc compounds in ecww after the vocs were stripped out the stripper residue contained non voc water it was treated by a packed bed reactor pbr fluidized catalytic reactor fcr and fluidized biological reactor fbr with optimisation studies fig 1 in this treatment process the pbr and fcr were used to increase the biodegradability and also for the chemical oxidation of recalcitrant organic compounds the fcr reactor was used for the biological oxidation of organic pollutants present in wastewater the reactor fabrication and description of pbr fcr and fbr are discussed in the supplementary information section s1 the operation conditions of each unit are explained in supplementary information section s2 s4 2 5 cyclic voltammetry study on vocs oxidation the cyclic voltammetry cv of instrument model chi660d was used to study the moncsm catalytic property and treatability it was done in a three electrode electrochemical cell at ambient conditions it contains the reference electrode of ag agcl the counter electrode of pt and the working electrode made with moncsm and 2 polyvinyl alcohol as conducting polymer similarly the working electrode of ncsm along with 2 polyvinyl alcohol was used as a control the electrochemical window of potential e from 0 8 to 1 v was used at a scan rate of 50 mv s 1 the cv system was studied without the addition of any external electrolyte as the naoh was used to adjust the ph of the water which helped the mobility of electrons 3 result and discussion 3 1 preparation of moncsm the following reactions are expected to occur in the preparation of the catalyst 1 rh mocl 5 rh mocl 5 2 rh mocl 5 prh mo h 2 o co 2 5cl 2 g 3 2 prh mo 2h 3 po 4 2moncsm 1 2 p 2 o 5 3h 2 o eq 1 represents the absorption of mocl5 in rice husk rh by capillary action at the time of soaking eq 2 represents pre carbonisation at 400 c resulted in pre carbonised material prhmo with loss of water and carbon dioxide the pre carbonised material was subjected to chemical activation using phosphoric acid at a temperature of 700 c during the activation the water was desorbed from h3po4 and formed p2o5 liquid the liquid p2o5 was vaporised at a temperature between 580 and 585 c then pyrolysis of prhmo took place eq 3 the lightweight gases removed in pyrolysis resulted in fine pores formation on the catalyst s surface the phosphoric acid could depolymerise the cellulose and hemicellulose present in the rh forming phosphate bridges resulting in strengthened material 19 the activated product of eq 3 was labelled as moncsm as it contains silica a similar mechanism followed in the preparation of ncsm without mo 3 2 physiochemical characterization of moncsm the moncsm was prepared with a different weight percentage of mo 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 w w concerning carbon and their physicochemical characterization tabulated in table 1 the ash content of the catalyst decreases with an increase in metal percentage while the density of the catalyst increases with an increase in molybdenum percentage the 5 mo carbon matrix showed a maximum percentage of mo impregnation 95 7 compared with others the leachability of mo from moncsm was analysed in the treated water and found below the detectable limit 3 2 1 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir the ftir spectrum of ncsm fig 2 a shows a peak at 3373 cm 1 due to the stretching of oh groups it was shifted to 3411 cm 1 in moncsm due to the addition of metal 20 the stretching of the co group present in ncsm 1637 cm 1 gets shifted in moncsm 1651 cm 1 the silica present in rice husk can form a bond with carbon matrix such as c o si in the process 21 24 the peak at 1095 cm 1 in ncsm could be due to the overlapping of the si o si and c o si bonds which get shifted in moncsm because of the bonding of molybdenum with carbon silica matrix 25 28 the peak at 803 cm 1 of ncsm is also due to the symmetric stretching vibration of si o si which gets shifted to 798 cm 1 in moncsm could be due to mo ion incorporation 29 four new peaks formed in moncsm at 602 656 703 912 cm 1 due to mo ion incorporation researchers have reported that the peaks between 500 and 991 cm 1 correspond to the mocx m o mo o mo vibrations of crystalline moox and the sharp peaks in the region 800 600 cm 1 correspond to the stretching vibrations of mo o mo 28 30 31 the ftir spectrum confirms the presence of molybdenum oxide in the carbon matrix 3 2 2 x ray diffraction spectroscopy xrd the xrd graph fig 2 b of ncsm shows crystalline phases of silica cristobalite tridymite and quartz at 2θ angles of 21 9 24 and 26 8 respectively merged as a single broad peak at 22 7 due to superimposing of phases 19 32 33 many researchers also observed and reported this phenomenon in xrd of rice husk based catalyst 34 36 the moncsm shows sharp crystalline peaks at 2θ value 26 38 and 44 6 correspond to the 002 and 100 planes of carbon that has crystallised with mo and mo2c 37 the researchers have reported that the peak at 2θ value of 26 38 corresponds to moo2 moc 38 39 and 2θ value of 40 06 for moo3 40 the 2θ value of 57 40 06 and 31 2 corresponds to moo2 the transformation of the broad peak in ncsm into a sharp peak in moncsm may be due to the change in their local environment of c si by bonding with mo ions researchers have been reported that the molybdenum oxide species on the surface of supported sio2 moo3 sio2 can form both dioxo o 2mo o si 2 and monoxo o mo o si 4 species which could have increased the crystallinity of the matrix as di oxo mo species dominant on silica 29 41 43 thus in the carbonisation process mo might have bonded with c si to reduce the amorphous nature of the material and increase its crystallinity the xrd spectrum confirmed the presence of molybdenum oxide on the carbon silica matrix and ftir findings also support the evidence 3 2 3 thermogravimetry analysis tga the thermogram of fig 2 c shows that incorporating molybdenum ion in ncsm increased the stability and strength of the catalyst with minimum weight loss the arrow mark indicates the higher stability point in the moncsm catalyst the weight loss in the ncsm thermogram is due to the loss of surface bound oxygen containing molecules but moncsm shows less reduction because of the strong bonding of mo ions with oxygen and carbon the tga findings of molybdenum ion bond formation with oxygen and carbon atoms support the evidence of ftir and xrd 3 2 4 differential scanning calorimetry dsc dsc was analysed from 30 c temperature to 300 c and it was found that the endothermic peak in both ncsm and moncsm near 100 c fig 2 d but the moncsm endothermic peak was broad when compared with ncsm additionally a new peak was observed due to the incorporation of mo ion in the carbon matrix this also supported the finding of tga ftir and xrd 3 2 5 electron paramagnetic resonance epr the epr analysis was studied for ncsm and moncsm with the plot of g factor vs intensity a u presented in fig 2 e and 2 f respectively the epr signals confirmed the presence of paramagnetic unpaired electrons or free radicals in both ncsm and moncsm the g factor of free electrons present in the ncsm was found to be 2 017 oxides of molybdenum exist as either molybdenum dioxides or molybdenum trioxides in which moo3 is epr active and moo2 is epr inactive moo3 exhibits its characteristic g factor peak from 1 90 to 1 99 44 48 moncsm exhibits the free electrons at a g factor of 2 011 along with the mo characteristics g factor at 1 92 the broadening of g factors might be due to the increase in the relaxation time of the free electrons in ncsm clustered with moo3 49 these results confirmed that the moncsm has free electrons which could involve in the vocs oxidation reaction 50 3 2 6 diffuse reflectance spectroscopy drs the drs spectrum of ncsm and moncsm is shown in the supporting information fig s2 the ncsm exhibited an absorption band at 300 nm while the moncsm showed the presence of redshift to 313 a new peak at 350 nm 430 nm formed due to metal to ligand charge transfer of monomeric tetrahedral and octahedral molybdenum species 51 the shift in the longer wavelength of moncsm was due to the incorporation of mo ion and charge transfer between the mo and carbon atoms 52 3 2 7 scanning electron microscope sem the sem image of ncsm and moncsm is shown in fig 3 a b it was found that the active sites pores present in the ncsm were occupied in moncsm by mo which implies the molybdenum ion has a strong presence on the carbon matrix the energy dispersive x ray analysis edax image of moncsm and the elemental composition is shown in supplementary information in fig s3 and table s1 it was found that mo presented 9 91 w w on the selected region of moncsm fig s3 shows a predominant peak of silica and the elemental composition in table s1 shows si present at 12 3 wt with 7 14 atomic in the selected region of moncsm and also si is the third highest element present next to carbon 37 03 and oxygen 39 31 3 2 8 pore size analysis of moncsm the pore size distribution psd was calculated by bjh barret joyner halenda method and n2 adsorption desorption was analysed by the bet brunaue emmett teller analysis method shown in fig 3 c d it was observed that moncsm obeyed type iv adsorption which means complete filling of pores by n2 gas molecule takes place the bet surface area of 72 2109 m2g 1 with type h3 hysteresis loop indicated a mesoporous structure the psd of moncsm was centred at 3 74 nm with consistent pore size from 18 nm to 26 nm and consisted of a desorption average pore diameter of 4 51 nm the psd shows the catalyst consists of nano size porous on the surface the characteristics of ncsm were reported by karthikeyan et al that the surfaces area of 379 m2g 1 and pore diameter of 39 36 å 53 the decrease in surface area is due to the incorporation of molybdenum ions 3 3 the holistic approach to treating evaporate condensate wastewater ecww while treating ecww directly using moncsm causes catalytic poisoning due to the presence of other compounds such as bounded ammoniacal nitrogen compounds and sulphur compounds etc thus vocs present in the ecww was separated and treated using moncsm whereas remaining non vocs containing ecww were treated using advanced oxidation processes 3 3 1 characterization of evaporate condensate wastewater ecww the physiochemical parameters of ecww are shown in table 2 a it was characterised by cod 210 000 240 000 mg l 1 biochemical oxygen demand bod 65 000 78 000 mg l 1 and toc 52 000 56 980 mg l 1 and tds of 250 300 mg l 1 the sample was analysed for a complete voc profile 60 vocs using gc and found that the predominant vocs were chloromethane 7580 μg l 1 toluene 1240 μg l 1 chlorobenzene 60 μg l 1 ethylbenzene 20 μg l 1 and 1 4 dichlorobenzene 410 μg l 1 3 3 2 separation of vocs and non vocs from evaporate condensate wastewater vocs from ecww were stripped and redissolved separately to obtain vocs contaminated water the ph of raw ecww was 11 6 and also maximum solubility of vocs in water was observed at the same ph thus the ph of the water was adjusted using naoh to 11 6 then the stripped vocs were redissolved the time was varied to obtain optimum hydraulic retention time hrt for dissolving vocs it was found that solubility increases with an increase in hrt up to 26 h after that no significant increase was observed fig 4a fig 4b shows the toc for vocs dissolved water at different time intervals at 1lpm which shows an increase in toc up to 26 h 8900 mg l 1 at maximum after that decrease in toc observed thus 26 h was fixed as optimum for further studies 3 3 3 catalytic oxidation of vocs present in ecww in liquid phase at optimised conditions the vocs dissolved water was catalytically oxidised using hydrogen peroxide of 6 mmol l 1 by ncsm and moncsm containing catalytic reactors the optimisation studies such as different metal percentage catalysts hrt ph and hydrogen peroxide were carried out for vocs oxidation the optimization of different metal percentages were done for 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 moncsm the samples were collected at different time intervals of 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 90 and 120 min to optimise hrt at a constant dosage of hydrogen peroxide 6 mmol and ph 11 fig 4 c it was found that at 70 min maximum reduction of vocs was observed for 5 moncsm whereas for 7 5 and 10 only a marginal difference was observed thus 5 moncsm itself was fixed as optimum for further studies the effect of ph was studied by varying ph 11 9 7 and 5 at a constant time 70 min and hydrogen peroxide dosage of 6 mmol l 1 for 5 moncsm it was found that ph 11 was optimum based on toc removal efficiency fig 4 d the effect of hydrogen peroxide was studied with different dosages of 3 mmol l 1 6 mmol l 1 9 mmol l 1 and 12 mmol l 1 it was found that 6 mmol l 1 gave optimum results whereas 9 mmol l 1 and 12 mmol l 1 gave only a marginal increase in the percentage removal thus 6 mmol l 1 was fixed as optimum for further studies the vocs dissolved water was catalytically oxidised at optimised conditions in continuous treatment cycles up to 20 cycles and the results are shown in fig 5 a the vocs removal efficiency was calculated based on the toc removal and found that using moncsm by 84 8 2 3 and ncsm by only 14 4 2 5 at optimised conditions the vocs removals were confirmed with hplc fig 5 b and the vocs dissolved water showed a peak at retention time rt 9 5 6 4 6 0 5 6 5 2 and 4 4 where 9 5 is a merged peak of toluene and chlorobenzene the rt 6 4 corresponds to ethylbenzene and the other three peaks correspond to low molecular weight organic compounds vocs the toluene and chlorobenzene were present after the catalytic oxidation by ncsm whereas the moncsm treated water had no toluene or chlorobenzene peak observed the disappearance of the peak at rt 6 4 confirms the oxidation of ethylbenzene by moncsm the moncsm treated water shows peaks at rt 5 9 5 5 5 4 5 0 and 4 2 corresponding to compounds of benzoquinone catechol formic acid maleic acid and benzyl alcohol respectively supplementary information fig s4 thus the hplc analysis implies that moncsm can completely oxidise the vocs such as toluene ethylbenzene and chlorobenzene present in the ecww whereas ncsm treated water doesn t show any notable changes in the hplc 3 3 4 electrospray ionisation mass spectrum esi ms study of voc water and treated voc water the esi ms of voc water is shown in fig 5 c which shows that the peak at m z 92 106 112 147 may be due to the molecular ion peak of toluene ethylbenzene chlorobenzene and 1 4 dichlorobenzene respectively the esi ms of treated vocs water using moncsm is shown in fig 5 d it was observed that the complete removal of toluene in the treatment process the hplc spectrum also supported the findings of its oxidation the peak at m z 121 may be due to the presence of benzoic acid formed by toluene oxidation 3 4 cyclic voltammetry study of voc water to observe the oxidation reduction trend the cyclic voltammetry was studied for vocs in raw effluent in 7 cycles at different times such as 0 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 min using ncsm and moncsm as the working electrode separately fig 6 a b in presence of hydrogen peroxide the cv study using ncsm doesn t show any oxidation and reduction peaks whereas the study using moncsm showed the various oxidation reduction peaks along with the increase in the peak current 54 the two oxidation peaks ox1 ox2 and corresponding reduction peaks red1 red2 in fig 6 b may be due to the redox reaction of vocs undergoing in the presence of moncsm the ipa ipc of ox1 and red1 at 0th min was 1 057 and then gradually it is increased up to 30 min followed by the decrease in the ratio 0 972 at 60 min observed a similar trend was observed in ipa ipc of ox2 and red2 due to the loss of the vocs population by redox reactions in the presence of moncsm the cv results confirmed that the moncsm could oxidise vocs whereas ncsm doesn t thus confirming the importance of mo in voc oxidation 3 5 plausible mechanism for vocs oxidation the moncsm adsorb the organic molecule on the surface of the matrix and then the generated hydroxyl radical degrades the vocs the plausible mechanism for the generation of hydroxyl radical and oxidation of vocs is as follows 4 mo 4 h 2 o 2 mo 5 oh ho 5 h 2 o 2 ho h 2 o ho 2 6 mo 6 ho 2 mo 5 h o 2 7 mo 5 ho 2 mo 4 h o 2 8 2ho 2 o 2 2oh 9 2oh vocs co 2 h 2 o mo has a 4 oxidation state in moo2 and it reacts with hydrogen peroxide to produce hydroxyl radical and mo5 ion eq 4 it again reacts with hydrogen peroxide to form hydroperoxyl radicals eq 5 moo3 which possesses a 6 oxidation state reacts with superoxide radicals to produce mo5 eq 6 the mo5 reacts with hydroperoxyl radical to produce mo4 back thus continuous hydroxyl radical generation occurs eq 7 55 the produced hydroxyl radicals reacted with vocs to degrade them into co2 and h2o eq 9 the plausible oxidation pathway of vocs such as toluene chlorobenzene 1 4 dichlorobenzene and chloromethane are shown below unlabelled image the toluene was catalytically oxidised by hydroxyl radical into products such as benzyl alcohol and benzoate the presence of an organic compound of benzyl alcohol was identified at an rt of 4 2 in hplc analysis further the benzoate was cleaved into maleic anhydride by ring cleavage reaction the maleic anhydride might be finally oxidised into co2 and h2o via maleic acid 56 57 the maleic acid was also identified in the analysis at rt of 5 0 formed by hydrolysis of maleic anhydride chlorobenzene was oxidised to form 3 chlorobenzene 1 2 diol then it underwent dechlorination to give catechol along with hydroquinone the product of catechol was identified by hplc analysis at rt of 5 5 fig 5 b further catechol and hydroquinone were oxidised into benzoquinone which was observed at rt 5 9 the formic acid identified at rt 5 4 could be formed by the ring cleavage reaction of benzoquinone which could be finally oxidised into water and carbon dioxide 58 the chloromethane also undergoes a dechlorination reaction then oxidised into water and carbon dioxide 59 so the hplc analysis findings of benzoquinone catechol formic acid maleic acid and benzyl alcohol support the plausible mechanism 3 6 catalytic oxidation of non vocs present in ecww after stripping vocs completely from ecww in the stripper reactor remaining non vocs were subjected to an advanced oxidation process using sequential reactors it consisted of pbr fcr and fbr as shown in fig 1 the optimisation studies of the effect of hrt the dosage of chemicals and the dosage of catalyst in pbr fcr and fbr are discussed in the supplementary information section s2 section s3 and section s4 respectively the optimised conditions were fixed based on the cod removal and the optimised condition for pbr were hrt 1 h the dosage of h2o2 0 2 ml l 1 30 w v and the dosage of kmno4 0 1 g l 1 the optimised conditions for fcr were hrt 24 h 0 1 g l 1 of kmno4 and ncsm 30 g l 1 finally the removal efficiency of non vocs at optimum conditions in terms of cod bod toc tkn and nh4 n was 98 78 98 54 99 46 78 2 95 respectively thus the proposed treatment scheme for ecww can treat both vocs and non vocs to obtain treated water for reuse purposes which helps the sustainability of the pharmaceutical industries table 2 b the treated ecww can be utilised for domestic and industrial purposes thus freshwater resources will be saved and environmental and industrial sustainability in terms of freshwater can also be achieved 4 conclusions the moncsm was synthesised using rice husk and characterised the xrd spectrum showed that mo was present as oxide in the carbon catalyst the presence of molybdenum was confirmed with ftir xrd sem edax drs tga and dsc analysis the vocs and non vocs present in ecww was separated using a stripper and vocs were redissolved in water at ph 11 6 then the redissolved vocs were catalytically oxidised using moncsm catalyst with an average removal efficiency of 84 8 2 3 in terms of toc in 20 treatment cycles thus the vocs were oxidised successfully in the liquid phase in the short time of 70 min vocs oxidations were monitored and confirmed by uv visible spectroscopy toc hplc cv and esi ms analysis the plausible mechanism for the oxidation of vocs was also discussed with instrumental evidence the remaining non vocs were treated using sequential reactors and their overall removal efficiency was cod 98 78 bod 98 54 toc 99 46 tkn 78 2 and nh4 n 95

12933,volatile organic compounds vocs are highly volatile in nature and cause significant air pollution in the environment it is copiously present in evaporate condensate wastewater ecww released by the pharmaceutical industry and can escape into the atmosphere during conventional aerobic wastewater treatment this study describes the preparation of molybdenum impregnated nanoporous carbon silica matrix moncsm and its efficiency toward catalytic oxidation of vocs present in ecww it also focuses on the oxidation of the non vocs present in ecww after vocs removal the moncsm was characterised by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy which confirmed the sharp peaks in the region 800 600 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibrations of mo o mo the x ray diffraction spectrum of moncsm showed 2θ values of 26 38 57 31 2 for moo2 and 40 06 for moo3 the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum showed the presence of free electrons in moncsm at a g factor of 2 011 the ecww possessed chemical oxygen demand cod of 210 000 240 000 mg l 1 in which 90 92 account for vocs the vocs were separated from ecww and catalytically oxidised using moncsm catalyst it showed a removal efficiency of 84 8 2 3 in terms of total organic carbon toc in 20 treatment cycles the remaining non vocs containing ecww were treated by advanced oxidation processes using sequential packed bed and fluidised bed reactors its overall removal efficiency was cod 98 78 biochemical oxygen demand 98 54 toc 99 46 total kjeldahl nitrogen 78 2 and nh4 n 95 respectively the catalytic oxidation of vocs present in ecww was confirmed using toc analysis and high performance liquid chromatography graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords volatile organic compounds catalytic oxidation molybdenum nanoporous carbon silica matrix pharmaceutical effluent 1 introduction volatile organic compounds vocs are profusely present in the atmosphere it undergoes the reaction in the presence of sunlight forming ground level ozone photochemical smog and ozone depletion which are detrimental to the ecosystem vocs have adverse effects of short and long term health complications on both human animal beings and most of the vocs are identified as human carcinogens 1 pharmaceutical industries mainly use inorganic salts and organic solvents in their processes resulting in high total dissolved solids tds and high voc containing wastewater 2 4 generally the multiple effect evaporator is used to treat pharma wastewater in which the high tds is retained in concentrate the evaporated liquid is condensed with organic compounds called evaporate condensate wastewater ecww 5 the ecww is alkaline and contains high chemical oxygen demand cod 210 000 240 000 mg l 1 and total organic carbon toc 52 000 56 980 mg l 1 due to the high organic pollution load vocs and non vocs conventionally the ecww is treated in an aerobic open wastewater treatment system leading to the volatilisation of vocs into the atmosphere and causing air pollution 6 it is not possible to collectively treat all the organic pollution present in ecww with a single treatment technique various methods for vocs removal in wastewater were attempted including bio filtration catalytic photocatalytic and thermal oxidation etc though biofiltration is the most commonly used technology to reduce voc emission it has the major disadvantages of the presence of ammonia in effluent which affects the efficiency of bio filters formation of clogging a large amount of biofilm accumulation biomass generation high investment cost and maintaining crucial biological conditions 7 the catalytic oxidation method is considered the most effective method as it completely destructs vocs 8 the thermal oxidation in the gas phase at a temperature of 250 500 c has been attempted by many researchers 9 13 but the gas phase treatment method at the field scale level has limitations of high cost high energy input and operation difficulties 14 the catalytic oxidation of vocs in the liquid phase at ambient conditions is considered economically feasible low cost and highly efficient than gas phase oxidation but it requires the most efficient catalyst to perform hence there is continuous research on the preparation of efficient catalysts to oxidise vocs present in pharmaceutical wastewater includes lots of challenges due to the complexity of wastewater the molybdenum containing catalyst possesses high selectivity toward vocs such as benzene chloro compounds toluene and cyclohexane 15 16 though the molybdenum is selective toward vocs it can t be applied directly as a homogeneous catalyst because of the difficulty to recover in treated water it results in a low life of the catalyst to overcome this problem carbon matrix is used as a supporting medium carbon supported matrices are one of the easier matrices to recover transition metals from the spent or unused catalyst the manuscript describes the holistic approach to effectively treat vocs and non vocs present in the ecww separately to avoid air pollution and for effective reuse of treated water this research article also describes the preparation and characterization of molybdenum impregnated nanoporous carbon silica matrix moncsm from the agricultural waste of rice husk for effective catalytic oxidation of vocs via organic alcohols as intermediates this proposed scheme addresses the treatment of ecww without the emission of high vocs in the surrounding environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the molybdenum v chloride 99 99 used in this study was bought from alfa aesar chemicals all other chemicals used in this study were analytical grade bought from s d fine chem limited 2 2 collection of ecww and characterization the vocs containing ecww were received from a pharmaceutical industry near chennai india and all physiochemical properties were characterised using american public health association apha methods 17 the voc profile present in ecww was analysed using usepa 5030c purge and trap method through gas chromatography gc the vocs present in the ecww was stripped out using air and redissolved in the water it was analysed using high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu with a pda detector spd m20a analytical flow cell c18 column a mobile phase of methanol and water 80 20 in the flow rate of 1 ml min the shimadzu ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2600 was used to identify and confirm the oxidation of vocs the shimadzu toc l rohs analyser was used to analyse toc present in the water the electrospray ionisation mass spectroscopy esi ms was analysed using waters make and xevotqd 2000 model for the voc contaminated water and treated voc water 2 3 preparation and characterization of molybdenum impregnated nanoporous carbon silica matrix moncsm the moncsm catalyst was prepared from the rice husk by soaking the molybdenum chloride solution onto the rice husk overnight then the metal soaked husk was dried in a hot air oven at 110 c until completely dry and then it was pre carbonised at 400 c for 4 h at a heating rate of 5 c min 1 the pre carbonised catalyst was subjected to activation by mixing well with phosphoric acid and then activated at 700 c for 1 h at a heating rate of 5 c min 1 after cooling it was labelled as moncsm the plain nanoporous carbon silica matrix ncsm was prepared side by side without adding molybdenum to the husk by following the procedure reported by maharaja et al 18 the moncsm and ncsm were analysed by powder x ray diffraction xrd using rich siefert 3000 diffractometer at 4 deg min 1 scanning in the range of 5 80 deg operated at 30kv and 15 ma with step sampling of 0 005 deg the perkin elmer make of fourier transform infrared ftir spectrophotometer was used to analyse functional groups present in moncsm and ncsm the sample was pelletised using spectroscopic grade kbr merk darmstadt germany to a thickness of 1 mm and diameter of 13 mm using the piston of a hydraulic pump by giving a pressure of 15 kpa cm 2 ftir spectrum was obtained by scanning in the range of 4000 to 400 cm 1 over five scans the thermogravimetric analysis tga was recorded from ambient temperature to 800 c with a heating rate of 10 c min 1 under a nitrogen atmosphere using q50 v20 6 build 31 the differential scanning calorimetric dsc was analysed from 30 c to 300 c using q200 v23 10 build 79 at a temperature gradient of 10 c the diffuse reflectance spectra drs was obtained using shimadzu uv visible scanning spectrophotometer to the powdered catalyst the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area was analysed to moncsm catalyst by adsorption of nitrogen gas at 77 5 k using asap 2020 v4 03 v4 03h analyser the mo loading in moncsm was confirmed by icp analysis for which the catalyst was converted into ash and then acid digestion was done for analysis the values are presented in table 1 2 4 treatment of ecww wastewater the holistic scheme for treating vocs and non vocs separately present in ecww is shown in fig 1 the ecww was stripped out in the stripper reactor using atmospheric air at 1 liter per minute lpm the stripped out vocs were dissolved in the distilled water at b2 in a 1 5 ratio at optimised conditions after condensing moisture in b1 it was found that 91 92 of vocs were redissolved contaminated in water then it was catalytically oxidised in the catalytic reactor cr after stripping vocs in the ecww by stripper reactor the stripper residue of non vocs containing water was further treated by catalytic oxidation methods at optimum conditions 2 4 1 catalytic oxidation of vocs present in evaporate condensate wastewater two similar cr were fabricated using an acrylic sheet as shown in fig s1 with a total volume of 500 ml and a working volume of 250 ml with dimensions of a diameter of 4 cm and height of 40 cm the cr bottom was packed with coarse quartz aggregate of 5 mm up to 2 cm height followed by packing of fine 3 mm aggregate up to 3 cm height then catalysts of ncsm cr ncsm and moncsm cr moncsm were packed with a height of 20 cm and the total height of the bed was 25 cm the vocs contaminated water was sprinkled on top of the reactor with an optimised dosage of h2o2 and the treated water was collected from the bottom for analysis the optimisation studies such as ph time and different airflow rates by lpm were studied for treatability 2 4 2 treatment of non voc compounds in ecww after the vocs were stripped out the stripper residue contained non voc water it was treated by a packed bed reactor pbr fluidized catalytic reactor fcr and fluidized biological reactor fbr with optimisation studies fig 1 in this treatment process the pbr and fcr were used to increase the biodegradability and also for the chemical oxidation of recalcitrant organic compounds the fcr reactor was used for the biological oxidation of organic pollutants present in wastewater the reactor fabrication and description of pbr fcr and fbr are discussed in the supplementary information section s1 the operation conditions of each unit are explained in supplementary information section s2 s4 2 5 cyclic voltammetry study on vocs oxidation the cyclic voltammetry cv of instrument model chi660d was used to study the moncsm catalytic property and treatability it was done in a three electrode electrochemical cell at ambient conditions it contains the reference electrode of ag agcl the counter electrode of pt and the working electrode made with moncsm and 2 polyvinyl alcohol as conducting polymer similarly the working electrode of ncsm along with 2 polyvinyl alcohol was used as a control the electrochemical window of potential e from 0 8 to 1 v was used at a scan rate of 50 mv s 1 the cv system was studied without the addition of any external electrolyte as the naoh was used to adjust the ph of the water which helped the mobility of electrons 3 result and discussion 3 1 preparation of moncsm the following reactions are expected to occur in the preparation of the catalyst 1 rh mocl 5 rh mocl 5 2 rh mocl 5 prh mo h 2 o co 2 5cl 2 g 3 2 prh mo 2h 3 po 4 2moncsm 1 2 p 2 o 5 3h 2 o eq 1 represents the absorption of mocl5 in rice husk rh by capillary action at the time of soaking eq 2 represents pre carbonisation at 400 c resulted in pre carbonised material prhmo with loss of water and carbon dioxide the pre carbonised material was subjected to chemical activation using phosphoric acid at a temperature of 700 c during the activation the water was desorbed from h3po4 and formed p2o5 liquid the liquid p2o5 was vaporised at a temperature between 580 and 585 c then pyrolysis of prhmo took place eq 3 the lightweight gases removed in pyrolysis resulted in fine pores formation on the catalyst s surface the phosphoric acid could depolymerise the cellulose and hemicellulose present in the rh forming phosphate bridges resulting in strengthened material 19 the activated product of eq 3 was labelled as moncsm as it contains silica a similar mechanism followed in the preparation of ncsm without mo 3 2 physiochemical characterization of moncsm the moncsm was prepared with a different weight percentage of mo 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 w w concerning carbon and their physicochemical characterization tabulated in table 1 the ash content of the catalyst decreases with an increase in metal percentage while the density of the catalyst increases with an increase in molybdenum percentage the 5 mo carbon matrix showed a maximum percentage of mo impregnation 95 7 compared with others the leachability of mo from moncsm was analysed in the treated water and found below the detectable limit 3 2 1 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir the ftir spectrum of ncsm fig 2 a shows a peak at 3373 cm 1 due to the stretching of oh groups it was shifted to 3411 cm 1 in moncsm due to the addition of metal 20 the stretching of the co group present in ncsm 1637 cm 1 gets shifted in moncsm 1651 cm 1 the silica present in rice husk can form a bond with carbon matrix such as c o si in the process 21 24 the peak at 1095 cm 1 in ncsm could be due to the overlapping of the si o si and c o si bonds which get shifted in moncsm because of the bonding of molybdenum with carbon silica matrix 25 28 the peak at 803 cm 1 of ncsm is also due to the symmetric stretching vibration of si o si which gets shifted to 798 cm 1 in moncsm could be due to mo ion incorporation 29 four new peaks formed in moncsm at 602 656 703 912 cm 1 due to mo ion incorporation researchers have reported that the peaks between 500 and 991 cm 1 correspond to the mocx m o mo o mo vibrations of crystalline moox and the sharp peaks in the region 800 600 cm 1 correspond to the stretching vibrations of mo o mo 28 30 31 the ftir spectrum confirms the presence of molybdenum oxide in the carbon matrix 3 2 2 x ray diffraction spectroscopy xrd the xrd graph fig 2 b of ncsm shows crystalline phases of silica cristobalite tridymite and quartz at 2θ angles of 21 9 24 and 26 8 respectively merged as a single broad peak at 22 7 due to superimposing of phases 19 32 33 many researchers also observed and reported this phenomenon in xrd of rice husk based catalyst 34 36 the moncsm shows sharp crystalline peaks at 2θ value 26 38 and 44 6 correspond to the 002 and 100 planes of carbon that has crystallised with mo and mo2c 37 the researchers have reported that the peak at 2θ value of 26 38 corresponds to moo2 moc 38 39 and 2θ value of 40 06 for moo3 40 the 2θ value of 57 40 06 and 31 2 corresponds to moo2 the transformation of the broad peak in ncsm into a sharp peak in moncsm may be due to the change in their local environment of c si by bonding with mo ions researchers have been reported that the molybdenum oxide species on the surface of supported sio2 moo3 sio2 can form both dioxo o 2mo o si 2 and monoxo o mo o si 4 species which could have increased the crystallinity of the matrix as di oxo mo species dominant on silica 29 41 43 thus in the carbonisation process mo might have bonded with c si to reduce the amorphous nature of the material and increase its crystallinity the xrd spectrum confirmed the presence of molybdenum oxide on the carbon silica matrix and ftir findings also support the evidence 3 2 3 thermogravimetry analysis tga the thermogram of fig 2 c shows that incorporating molybdenum ion in ncsm increased the stability and strength of the catalyst with minimum weight loss the arrow mark indicates the higher stability point in the moncsm catalyst the weight loss in the ncsm thermogram is due to the loss of surface bound oxygen containing molecules but moncsm shows less reduction because of the strong bonding of mo ions with oxygen and carbon the tga findings of molybdenum ion bond formation with oxygen and carbon atoms support the evidence of ftir and xrd 3 2 4 differential scanning calorimetry dsc dsc was analysed from 30 c temperature to 300 c and it was found that the endothermic peak in both ncsm and moncsm near 100 c fig 2 d but the moncsm endothermic peak was broad when compared with ncsm additionally a new peak was observed due to the incorporation of mo ion in the carbon matrix this also supported the finding of tga ftir and xrd 3 2 5 electron paramagnetic resonance epr the epr analysis was studied for ncsm and moncsm with the plot of g factor vs intensity a u presented in fig 2 e and 2 f respectively the epr signals confirmed the presence of paramagnetic unpaired electrons or free radicals in both ncsm and moncsm the g factor of free electrons present in the ncsm was found to be 2 017 oxides of molybdenum exist as either molybdenum dioxides or molybdenum trioxides in which moo3 is epr active and moo2 is epr inactive moo3 exhibits its characteristic g factor peak from 1 90 to 1 99 44 48 moncsm exhibits the free electrons at a g factor of 2 011 along with the mo characteristics g factor at 1 92 the broadening of g factors might be due to the increase in the relaxation time of the free electrons in ncsm clustered with moo3 49 these results confirmed that the moncsm has free electrons which could involve in the vocs oxidation reaction 50 3 2 6 diffuse reflectance spectroscopy drs the drs spectrum of ncsm and moncsm is shown in the supporting information fig s2 the ncsm exhibited an absorption band at 300 nm while the moncsm showed the presence of redshift to 313 a new peak at 350 nm 430 nm formed due to metal to ligand charge transfer of monomeric tetrahedral and octahedral molybdenum species 51 the shift in the longer wavelength of moncsm was due to the incorporation of mo ion and charge transfer between the mo and carbon atoms 52 3 2 7 scanning electron microscope sem the sem image of ncsm and moncsm is shown in fig 3 a b it was found that the active sites pores present in the ncsm were occupied in moncsm by mo which implies the molybdenum ion has a strong presence on the carbon matrix the energy dispersive x ray analysis edax image of moncsm and the elemental composition is shown in supplementary information in fig s3 and table s1 it was found that mo presented 9 91 w w on the selected region of moncsm fig s3 shows a predominant peak of silica and the elemental composition in table s1 shows si present at 12 3 wt with 7 14 atomic in the selected region of moncsm and also si is the third highest element present next to carbon 37 03 and oxygen 39 31 3 2 8 pore size analysis of moncsm the pore size distribution psd was calculated by bjh barret joyner halenda method and n2 adsorption desorption was analysed by the bet brunaue emmett teller analysis method shown in fig 3 c d it was observed that moncsm obeyed type iv adsorption which means complete filling of pores by n2 gas molecule takes place the bet surface area of 72 2109 m2g 1 with type h3 hysteresis loop indicated a mesoporous structure the psd of moncsm was centred at 3 74 nm with consistent pore size from 18 nm to 26 nm and consisted of a desorption average pore diameter of 4 51 nm the psd shows the catalyst consists of nano size porous on the surface the characteristics of ncsm were reported by karthikeyan et al that the surfaces area of 379 m2g 1 and pore diameter of 39 36 å 53 the decrease in surface area is due to the incorporation of molybdenum ions 3 3 the holistic approach to treating evaporate condensate wastewater ecww while treating ecww directly using moncsm causes catalytic poisoning due to the presence of other compounds such as bounded ammoniacal nitrogen compounds and sulphur compounds etc thus vocs present in the ecww was separated and treated using moncsm whereas remaining non vocs containing ecww were treated using advanced oxidation processes 3 3 1 characterization of evaporate condensate wastewater ecww the physiochemical parameters of ecww are shown in table 2 a it was characterised by cod 210 000 240 000 mg l 1 biochemical oxygen demand bod 65 000 78 000 mg l 1 and toc 52 000 56 980 mg l 1 and tds of 250 300 mg l 1 the sample was analysed for a complete voc profile 60 vocs using gc and found that the predominant vocs were chloromethane 7580 μg l 1 toluene 1240 μg l 1 chlorobenzene 60 μg l 1 ethylbenzene 20 μg l 1 and 1 4 dichlorobenzene 410 μg l 1 3 3 2 separation of vocs and non vocs from evaporate condensate wastewater vocs from ecww were stripped and redissolved separately to obtain vocs contaminated water the ph of raw ecww was 11 6 and also maximum solubility of vocs in water was observed at the same ph thus the ph of the water was adjusted using naoh to 11 6 then the stripped vocs were redissolved the time was varied to obtain optimum hydraulic retention time hrt for dissolving vocs it was found that solubility increases with an increase in hrt up to 26 h after that no significant increase was observed fig 4a fig 4b shows the toc for vocs dissolved water at different time intervals at 1lpm which shows an increase in toc up to 26 h 8900 mg l 1 at maximum after that decrease in toc observed thus 26 h was fixed as optimum for further studies 3 3 3 catalytic oxidation of vocs present in ecww in liquid phase at optimised conditions the vocs dissolved water was catalytically oxidised using hydrogen peroxide of 6 mmol l 1 by ncsm and moncsm containing catalytic reactors the optimisation studies such as different metal percentage catalysts hrt ph and hydrogen peroxide were carried out for vocs oxidation the optimization of different metal percentages were done for 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 moncsm the samples were collected at different time intervals of 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 90 and 120 min to optimise hrt at a constant dosage of hydrogen peroxide 6 mmol and ph 11 fig 4 c it was found that at 70 min maximum reduction of vocs was observed for 5 moncsm whereas for 7 5 and 10 only a marginal difference was observed thus 5 moncsm itself was fixed as optimum for further studies the effect of ph was studied by varying ph 11 9 7 and 5 at a constant time 70 min and hydrogen peroxide dosage of 6 mmol l 1 for 5 moncsm it was found that ph 11 was optimum based on toc removal efficiency fig 4 d the effect of hydrogen peroxide was studied with different dosages of 3 mmol l 1 6 mmol l 1 9 mmol l 1 and 12 mmol l 1 it was found that 6 mmol l 1 gave optimum results whereas 9 mmol l 1 and 12 mmol l 1 gave only a marginal increase in the percentage removal thus 6 mmol l 1 was fixed as optimum for further studies the vocs dissolved water was catalytically oxidised at optimised conditions in continuous treatment cycles up to 20 cycles and the results are shown in fig 5 a the vocs removal efficiency was calculated based on the toc removal and found that using moncsm by 84 8 2 3 and ncsm by only 14 4 2 5 at optimised conditions the vocs removals were confirmed with hplc fig 5 b and the vocs dissolved water showed a peak at retention time rt 9 5 6 4 6 0 5 6 5 2 and 4 4 where 9 5 is a merged peak of toluene and chlorobenzene the rt 6 4 corresponds to ethylbenzene and the other three peaks correspond to low molecular weight organic compounds vocs the toluene and chlorobenzene were present after the catalytic oxidation by ncsm whereas the moncsm treated water had no toluene or chlorobenzene peak observed the disappearance of the peak at rt 6 4 confirms the oxidation of ethylbenzene by moncsm the moncsm treated water shows peaks at rt 5 9 5 5 5 4 5 0 and 4 2 corresponding to compounds of benzoquinone catechol formic acid maleic acid and benzyl alcohol respectively supplementary information fig s4 thus the hplc analysis implies that moncsm can completely oxidise the vocs such as toluene ethylbenzene and chlorobenzene present in the ecww whereas ncsm treated water doesn t show any notable changes in the hplc 3 3 4 electrospray ionisation mass spectrum esi ms study of voc water and treated voc water the esi ms of voc water is shown in fig 5 c which shows that the peak at m z 92 106 112 147 may be due to the molecular ion peak of toluene ethylbenzene chlorobenzene and 1 4 dichlorobenzene respectively the esi ms of treated vocs water using moncsm is shown in fig 5 d it was observed that the complete removal of toluene in the treatment process the hplc spectrum also supported the findings of its oxidation the peak at m z 121 may be due to the presence of benzoic acid formed by toluene oxidation 3 4 cyclic voltammetry study of voc water to observe the oxidation reduction trend the cyclic voltammetry was studied for vocs in raw effluent in 7 cycles at different times such as 0 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 min using ncsm and moncsm as the working electrode separately fig 6 a b in presence of hydrogen peroxide the cv study using ncsm doesn t show any oxidation and reduction peaks whereas the study using moncsm showed the various oxidation reduction peaks along with the increase in the peak current 54 the two oxidation peaks ox1 ox2 and corresponding reduction peaks red1 red2 in fig 6 b may be due to the redox reaction of vocs undergoing in the presence of moncsm the ipa ipc of ox1 and red1 at 0th min was 1 057 and then gradually it is increased up to 30 min followed by the decrease in the ratio 0 972 at 60 min observed a similar trend was observed in ipa ipc of ox2 and red2 due to the loss of the vocs population by redox reactions in the presence of moncsm the cv results confirmed that the moncsm could oxidise vocs whereas ncsm doesn t thus confirming the importance of mo in voc oxidation 3 5 plausible mechanism for vocs oxidation the moncsm adsorb the organic molecule on the surface of the matrix and then the generated hydroxyl radical degrades the vocs the plausible mechanism for the generation of hydroxyl radical and oxidation of vocs is as follows 4 mo 4 h 2 o 2 mo 5 oh ho 5 h 2 o 2 ho h 2 o ho 2 6 mo 6 ho 2 mo 5 h o 2 7 mo 5 ho 2 mo 4 h o 2 8 2ho 2 o 2 2oh 9 2oh vocs co 2 h 2 o mo has a 4 oxidation state in moo2 and it reacts with hydrogen peroxide to produce hydroxyl radical and mo5 ion eq 4 it again reacts with hydrogen peroxide to form hydroperoxyl radicals eq 5 moo3 which possesses a 6 oxidation state reacts with superoxide radicals to produce mo5 eq 6 the mo5 reacts with hydroperoxyl radical to produce mo4 back thus continuous hydroxyl radical generation occurs eq 7 55 the produced hydroxyl radicals reacted with vocs to degrade them into co2 and h2o eq 9 the plausible oxidation pathway of vocs such as toluene chlorobenzene 1 4 dichlorobenzene and chloromethane are shown below unlabelled image the toluene was catalytically oxidised by hydroxyl radical into products such as benzyl alcohol and benzoate the presence of an organic compound of benzyl alcohol was identified at an rt of 4 2 in hplc analysis further the benzoate was cleaved into maleic anhydride by ring cleavage reaction the maleic anhydride might be finally oxidised into co2 and h2o via maleic acid 56 57 the maleic acid was also identified in the analysis at rt of 5 0 formed by hydrolysis of maleic anhydride chlorobenzene was oxidised to form 3 chlorobenzene 1 2 diol then it underwent dechlorination to give catechol along with hydroquinone the product of catechol was identified by hplc analysis at rt of 5 5 fig 5 b further catechol and hydroquinone were oxidised into benzoquinone which was observed at rt 5 9 the formic acid identified at rt 5 4 could be formed by the ring cleavage reaction of benzoquinone which could be finally oxidised into water and carbon dioxide 58 the chloromethane also undergoes a dechlorination reaction then oxidised into water and carbon dioxide 59 so the hplc analysis findings of benzoquinone catechol formic acid maleic acid and benzyl alcohol support the plausible mechanism 3 6 catalytic oxidation of non vocs present in ecww after stripping vocs completely from ecww in the stripper reactor remaining non vocs were subjected to an advanced oxidation process using sequential reactors it consisted of pbr fcr and fbr as shown in fig 1 the optimisation studies of the effect of hrt the dosage of chemicals and the dosage of catalyst in pbr fcr and fbr are discussed in the supplementary information section s2 section s3 and section s4 respectively the optimised conditions were fixed based on the cod removal and the optimised condition for pbr were hrt 1 h the dosage of h2o2 0 2 ml l 1 30 w v and the dosage of kmno4 0 1 g l 1 the optimised conditions for fcr were hrt 24 h 0 1 g l 1 of kmno4 and ncsm 30 g l 1 finally the removal efficiency of non vocs at optimum conditions in terms of cod bod toc tkn and nh4 n was 98 78 98 54 99 46 78 2 95 respectively thus the proposed treatment scheme for ecww can treat both vocs and non vocs to obtain treated water for reuse purposes which helps the sustainability of the pharmaceutical industries table 2 b the treated ecww can be utilised for domestic and industrial purposes thus freshwater resources will be saved and environmental and industrial sustainability in terms of freshwater can also be achieved 4 conclusions the moncsm was synthesised using rice husk and characterised the xrd spectrum showed that mo was present as oxide in the carbon catalyst the presence of molybdenum was confirmed with ftir xrd sem edax drs tga and dsc analysis the vocs and non vocs present in ecww was separated using a stripper and vocs were redissolved in water at ph 11 6 then the redissolved vocs were catalytically oxidised using moncsm catalyst with an average removal efficiency of 84 8 2 3 in terms of toc in 20 treatment cycles thus the vocs were oxidised successfully in the liquid phase in the short time of 70 min vocs oxidations were monitored and confirmed by uv visible spectroscopy toc hplc cv and esi ms analysis the plausible mechanism for the oxidation of vocs was also discussed with instrumental evidence the remaining non vocs were treated using sequential reactors and their overall removal efficiency was cod 98 78 bod 98 54 toc 99 46 tkn 78 2 and nh4 n 95

deammonification ssd processes have been successfully operated to treat high strength nh4 n but often fail to treat moderate strength nh4 n 100 300 mg l moderate strength nh4 n causes deterioration of process efficiency to occur no2 n oxidizing bacteria nob due to free ammonia fa reduction and maintenance limits the optimal fa 0 1 mg l control focusing on real time monitoring ph and nh4 n under controlling low do was integrated to enhance the ssd process stability operational treating moderate strength nh4 n wastewater the average nre and nrr were still high as 82 1 and 0 22 0 01 kg m3 d a real time monitoring system strategy that directly uses do nh4 n and ph was effective in stably providing optimal do 0 1 mg l and sufficient fa 0 1 mg l that capable in inhibiting selective nob activity microbial community characterization revealed that denitrifying bacteria indicate their important role in the improved nitrogen removal performance using in organic matter of reject water without another anoxic period under long term low do with optimal fa conditions the research results are expected to prevent the problem of unstable due to the substrate competition of major microorganisms and to reduce the deterioration within the ssd process due to excessive nob activity keywords anammox free ammonia nitrite oxidizing bacteria suppression single stage deammonification real time monitoring system 1 introduction the deammonification process is applied as an energy efficient reject water treatment process and it is focusing on a carbon neutral wastewater treatment process 1 2 the deammonification process consists of partial nitritation pn and ammonium nh4 n oxidation to nitrite no2 n by nh4 n oxidizing bacteria aob under aerobic conditions while anaerobic nh4 n oxidation anammox with no2 n as an electron acceptor by anammox bacteria amx and nitrate no3 n reduction by heterotrophic no3 n denitrifying bacteria under anaerobic conditions 3 4 these aerobic and anaerobic reactions can be successfully achieved in a sequential batch reactor sbr called the single stage deammonification ssd process 5 most ssd process has been widely applied for treating high strength nh4 n 500 mg l wastewater and currently has more than 150 full scale sites worldwide 6 7 however more than 50 of the sites using the ssd process experience deterioration caused by the no3 n accumulation 6 8 10 the complex processes with diverse microbial communities existing in one reactor became the major challenge of the ssd application competition for the usual substrate of major microorganisms occurs in the ssd process the experiences of deterioration are caused by the excessive growth of no2 n oxidizing bacteria nob 6 8 11 therefore it is essential to suppress nob activity to successfully and stably operate the ssd process in particular since nob coexists with aob and other microorganisms it is difficult to completely separate and operate in order to solve the problem several methods such as amx booster inoculation with nob removed high temperature 30 40 c operation and addition of chemical inhibitors e g hydroxylamine are applied 12 14 however these methods require high operating cost recently a method using a sensor of control monitoring is being applied as an effective method with a stable reliable and relatively low operating cost in general the using of ph sensor controlled the reaction time by indirectly monitoring the substrate depletion 6 the limitation in ssd process application occurs when no significant change of ph happened the reaction time using a do sensor was controlled by directly or indirectly checking substrate depletion 6 15 it was plausible to suppress nob activity by controlling with low do concentration 1 0 mg l according to the difference between aob and nob oxygen half saturation constants 16 17 when solely relying on the do sensor it will lead to excessive aeration due to sensor error causes nitrate accumulation damage to the microbial balance and prolonged process recovery 6 18 thus it is more advantageous to monitor the air flow rate and nitrogen compounds at the same time 19 additionally it was also possible to directly check the substrate concentration by using the nitrogen compound sensor nh4 n no2 n no3 n 20 it was also feasible to flexibly operate the reaction time in real time condition according to the microbial activity the ssd process applied to the actual wastewater treatment process the most operational problem was still related to the no3 n built up due to aeration control error 6 21 additionally with the wide load variation of real wastewater conditions there is a limit to the application of the existing process technology and the performance comparison presented the nh4 n is converted to fa form depending on ph and temperature in wastewater 22 23 the specific fa 0 1 1 0 mg l can selectively inhibit nob activity without affecting the activity of amx and aob 24 in most cases of high concentration nh4 n treatment the effluent is returned to the mainstream for final treatment thus the effluent nh4 n concentration is in high level over 70 100 mg l despite the high treatment efficiency of over 80 25 26 since the relatively high effluent nh4 n concentration maintains high fa concentration the fluctuations of fa are not considered however the changing in the properties of reject water that occurs depending on the operation and efficiency of each unit process sedimentation and sludge dewatering etc is the mixed reject water which is moderate strength nh4 n 100 300 mg l of influent in the ssd process 27 it can cause deterioration of process efficiency due to fa reduction and maintenance limits therefore if it is possible to continuously maintain appropriate fa by directly using the fluctuating nh4 n and ph it will be potential to secure an operation strategy that enables more stable inhibition of nob activity in the ssd process this study attempted to evaluate the optimal fa control effect on the long term stability of ssd treating moderate strength nh4 n wastewater 100 300 mg l the optimal fa control strategy focusing on real time monitoring ph and nh4 n under controlling low do ensure stable effluent quality despite fluctuations at influent concentration the research results are expected to prevent the problem of unstable initial construction due to the substrate competition of major microorganisms and to reduce the deterioration within the ssd process due to excessive nob activity 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum

the hydraulic retention time hrt was determined as the time of 1 cycle divided by a volume exchange ratio ver the set up hrt was 24 h but it was operated range at 12 48 h as the reaction time was controlled by the real time monitoring system described in section 2 2 2 the ver was selected at 25 2 2 2 real time control system the real time monitoring system of nh4 n concentration was applied for ensuring the same effluent quality at a load of variation in the inflow water through selective operation control of sensor information in the ssd process fig 2 the ssd process was controlled by measuring nh4 n and ph which actuated on initial fa 10 mg l and effluent fa 0 1 mg l that reached by the sensor the initial and effluent had an nh4 n set point of 200 mg l and 20 mg l ph set point of 8 and 6 6 inhibition condition for nob by fa the do sensor was used to control the do concentration is kept lower than 0 3 mg l by the air supply when the do set point is lower than 0 1 mg l and higher than 0 2 mg l 2 2 3 operation phase condition the operation of the ssd process was divided into 3 phases in phase 1 start up phase nitrogen removal efficiency nre was achieved over 80 an anoxic period was introduced in phase 2 to remove accumulated nitrate through heterotrophic denitrification suppress nob and enhance amx activity phase 3 achieved stabilization and increased the nitrogen

biotechnology information ncbi sequence read archive sra database table s2 2 5 analysis methods all liquid samples taken from the influent and effluent were filtered using 0 2 μm disposable filters the nh4 n and cod concentrations were monitored daily in at least one batch experiment the concentrations of these parameters were measured using an analysis kit humas co ltd korea with a spectrophotometer hs 1000 humas co ltd korea no2 n and no3 n concentrations were determined using an ics 1000 ion chromatography system dionex sunnyvale ca usa with a dionex ionpac as14 analytical column 4 250 mm mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were analyzed using standard methods 30 3 results and discussion 3 1 start up of the anammox process the nh4 n and no2 n in the influent were used by amx achieving about 100 no2 n removal efficiency and a total nrr of 0 66 kg m3 d fig 3 by decreasing hrt from 25 h to 10 h the growth of amx was induced by applying the gradual increase of nitrogen loading rate nlr from 0 35 kg m3 d to 0 85 kg m3 d the no2 nremoved nh4 nremoved and no3 nremoved nh4 nremoved were monitored for indicating the performance of amx after 260 days the ratio of no2 nremoved nh4 nremoved and no3 nremoved nh4 nremoved were 1 21 and 0 23 respectively which were not consistent with previous results 1 32 for no2 nremoved nh4 nremoved and 0 26 for no3 nremoved nh4 nremoved 31 1 146 and 0 161 32 1 133 and 0 161 1 3 and 0 242 33 however since the ratio may slightly depend on the reactor types and operating conditions and since ssd showed stable state it can be expected that the amx has occurred sufficiently in ssd process the amx was secured with about 0 5 kg m3 of inoculum for the ssd process 3 2 start up of the partial nitritation process the operation of the partial nitritation process was carried out reliably at synthetic medium and real reject water for about a month achieving a high arr of up to 1 11 kg m3 d in the real reject water fig 4a the nh4 n was stably nitritation about 50 from 373 to 160 mg l to supply no2 n required for the ssd process the no2 n was produced at 185 mg l and no3 n was hardly generated at 1 mg l fig 4b during the reaction the fa 0 4 12 mg l and the do 0 75 0 19 mg l seem to inhibit nob activity depending on the oxygen half saturation coefficients aob has a higher do affinity and is favored over nob at lower do below 0 3 mg l 34 therefore suggests that the partial nitritation did successfully perform in this reactor the aob was secured with about 1 6 kg m3 of inoculum for the ssd process 3 3 performance of the ssd process the optimal fa 0 1 mg l was successfully maintained and nob activity was effectively inhibited through real time monitoring control of nh4 n and ph in ssd processes with moderate strength nh4 n mixed reject water and influent fluctuations therefore the monitoring system strategy guaranteed stable operation and constant effluent quality nre 80 and nrr 0 25 kg m3 day 3 3 1 phase 1 day 0 40 start up of the ssd process the nh4 n was removed without no2 n accumulation but nh4 n and no3 n were accumulated in the effluent fig 5a the ph decreased rapidly due to the partial nitritation the ssd reaction time was preferentially terminated by ph control value of 6 6 thus the effluent nh4 n was higher than the control value of 20 mg l the ratio of no3 nproduced nh4 nremoved was average 0 19 fig 5a which was higher than the partial nitritation anammox theoretical value of 0 11 8 31 not only the amx but also the nob used no2 n produced by the aob despite the do 0 1 mg l the fa 0 1 mg l the activity of the amx was lower than the aob so the activity of the nob appeared in the ssd fig 5b there was a possibility of a difference in activity because the aob and amx had different inoculation amounts and the aob was 1 6 kg m3 three times more than amx 0 5 kg m3 the nre and nrr were average 74 and 0 20 kg m3 d respectively fig 5a 3 3 2 phase 2 day 41 244 effect of anoxic condition to inhibit nob the anoxic condition alleviated no3 n accumulation fig 5a the fluctuation of ph gradually decreased during the reaction fig 5b the ratio of no3 nproduced nh4 nremoved was gradually decreased to an average of 0 07 fig 5a which was lower than the partial nitritation anammox theoretical value 0 11 the no3 n removal was related to denitrification activity at anoxic or low do conditions 14 35 36 it is understood that the overall contribution to total nitrogen removal of denitrifying heterotrophic bacteria in this reject water is minimal due to a very limited biodegradable cod fraction see section 3 4 for details it promoted the amx activity and suppressed the nob activity during the anoxic period in addition despite large fluctuations decreases in the influent nh4 n concentration 100 to 250 mg l those were stably maintained nh4 n 20 mg l no3 n 10 mg l in the effluent the nre average 82 up to 85 and nrr average 0 18 kg m3 d up to 0 21 kg m3 d fig 5a 3 3 3 phase 3 day 245 286 optimization of the ssd process the deammonification became stable without an anoxic period those were stably maintained under 10 mg l no3 n in the effluent fig 5a the nlr and nrr gradually increased during the reaction fig 5a the ratio of no3 nproduced nh4 nremoved was about 0 06 which was lower than the theoretical value 0 11 8 31 also the no3 n removal was related to denitrification activity at low do 0 3 mg l condition 14 36 the optimal low do 0 3 mg l and fa 0 1 mg l were maintained stably and continuously through nh4 n and ph real time monitoring system which is effective in suppressing nob activity the average nre and nrr were still high as 82 1 and 0 22 0 01 kg m3 d 3 4 effect of real time monitoring system in ssd process a real time monitoring system strategy that directly uses do nh4 n and ph was effective in stably providing optimal do 0 1 mg l and sufficient fa 0 1 mg l that capable in inhibiting selective nob activity although ph do and nh4 n sensors are widely used for process monitoring in many studies table s2 each was monitored within each limitation range and fa was not considered however in this study they were monitored in combination with each other to maintain a proper fa range for nob activity inhibition and amx activity maintenance therefore this strategy has the advantage of being able to check a proper fa while monitoring ph do and nh4 n in real time so that the process can be operated more stably it can respond quickly to environmental changes regardless of the influent nitrogen concentration range in the previous report there was a reactivation problem of nob when long term operation at low do condition 37 38 however this result showed despite the low do 0 04 0 2 mg l simultaneous fa 0 1 0 8 mg l control was possibly reduced no3 n concentration and additional heterotrophic denitrification fig 6 on the 124 days the results of tracking fig 6a showed that when nh4 n was reduced by about 43 mg l approximately 8 mg l of no3 n was produced the ratio of no3 nproduced nh4 nremoved was about 0 19 which was higher than the theoretical value 0 11 on the 243 days the results of tracking fig 6b showed that when nh4 n was reduced by about 35 mg l approximately 2 mg l of no3 n was produced in the reaction cycle the ratio of no3 nproduced nh4 nremoved was about 0 05 which was about 50 the theoretical value 0 11 8 31 it could be seen that the concentration of no3 n production has been decreased compared to the 124 day tracking results it was possible to confirm that nob seemed to be suppressed although the effect of no3 n and cod removal on the anoxic period 30 min was insignificant it was thought that the anoxic period could promote the activity of amx 14 39 40 the organic matter removal is related to denitrification activity at long term low do conditions 2 41 it is understood that the overall contribution to total nitrogen removal of denitrifying heterotrophic bacteria in this reject water is minimal due to a very limited biodegradable cod fraction the fluctuations of ph during the reaction were small which means that ph consumption in the aerobic nh4 n oxidation and ph generation compensation in the anaerobic nh4 n reaction were simultaneously performed effectively building deammonification in a single reactor this is the advantage of not adding drugs required for acidity control in the ssd process 3 5 microbial community microbial community analyses were conducted to understand the variation in functional bacterial groups related to nitrogen removal with respect to the operational conditions a total of 618 693 otus were obtained during the illumina miseq sequencing under a 97 similarity limit table 1 compared with the inoculum biodiversity decreased in phase1 as shown by the decreased shannon index and inverse simpson index primarily because major functional bacterial groups dominated in the limited substrate and oxygen according to the continuous deammonification conditions on the other hand it increased in phase2 because the anoxic condition altered the nitrification and denitrification microbial community the microbial community analyzed at the phylum level showed that the inoculum was dominated by planctomycetes 22 7 proteobacteria 18 5 and bacteroidetes 14 1 compared to inoculum the amount of nitrospirae and chlorobi on day 23 phase 1 dramatically increased while finally nitrospirae decreased from 9 5 to 0 7 and chlorobi decreased from 17 3 to 2 8 on day 259 phase 3 planctomycetes are known to contain amx it decreased to 14 on day 23 phase1 but increased to 18 7 on day 259 phase3 the microorganisms responsible for the heterotrophic denitrification and autotrophic denitrification were identified in proteobacteria chlorobi and chloroflexi proteobacteria chloroflexi are known to promote granule formation and co exist with amx and heterotrophic bacteria 42 ignavibacteriae is a well known phylum that contributes to nitrogen removal by reducing no3 n to no2 n 43 genus level analysis provided a deeper understanding of microbial community variation fig 7b three amx genera were detected candidatus brocadia candidatus jettenia and anammox uncultured the dominant amx genus in the inoculum was ca brocadia 11 4 followed by anammox uncultured 8 9 on day 23 phase 1 the abundance of ca brocadia 3 6 and anammox uncultured 4 7 decreased after process stabilization on day 259 phase 3 the abundance of ca brocadia increased to 7 2 and anammox uncultured increased to 7 9 it seems that the stable maintenance of the fa concentration higher than 0 1 mg l in the real time monitoring system was advantageous for the activity of amx most of the aob sequences obtained were affiliated with the genus nitrosomonas its relative abundance in the inoculum was 11 6 and decreased to 3 2 on day 259 phase 3 this was possibly affected by the limited do 0 3 mg l as do concentration was controlled to be low to limit nob growth aob would have competed with heterotrophs to use the low concentrations of do the growth of aob would have been limited because of the lack of available nh4 n with a decreasing of influent nh4 n concentration 44 although the abundance of aob decreased the nh4 n oxidation efficiency remained high most of the sequences obtained related to the nob genera were nitrospira nitrobacter is another genus of nob was not detected in the results previous studies had found that nitrospira favors low do 45 46 thus the relatively low do in this study 0 3 mg l stimulated the growth of nitrospira rather than that of nitrobacter the proportion was small at 0 2 in the inoculum it increased to 4 5 on day 23 phase 1 but decreased to 1 3 on day 259 phase 3 it seems that the stable maintenance simultaneously of the do 0 3 mg l fa 0 1 mg l in the real time monitoring system was advantageous in suppressing the nob the possible heterotrophic denitrifying genera were ignavibacteriales bacterium 12 8 ignavibacterium 6 9 candidatus latescibacteria uncultured 3 1 and chlorobi uncultured 2 8 they may participate in no2 n production by reducing no3 n 43 47 although heterotrophs compete with aob to use oxygen they not only remove organic matter but also remove no3 n produced by amx or nob which can greatly enhance the overall efficiency of the ssd process 48 49 4 conclusions the optimal fa control focusing on real time monitoring ph and nh4 n under controlling low do and temperature of 30 1 c was essential for the stable operation of ssd process technologies and to treat moderate strength nh4 n mixed reject water 1 prevented unstable operation problems caused to no3 n accumulated by nob activity 2 stable low concentration effluent quality has been secured despite the influent characteristic fluctuations 3 additional dependent denitrification using organic matter contained in reject water was possible without a separate anoxic phase 4 effectively contributed to the balanced dominance of aerobic and anaerobic deammonification microbial communities therefore the results of the study provide support

deammonification ssd processes have been successfully operated to treat high strength nh4 n but often fail to treat moderate strength nh4 n 100 300 mg l moderate strength nh4 n causes deterioration of process efficiency to occur no2 n oxidizing bacteria nob due to free ammonia fa reduction and maintenance limits the optimal fa 0 1 mg l control focusing on real time monitoring ph and nh4 n under controlling low do was integrated to enhance the ssd process stability operational treating moderate strength nh4 n wastewater the average nre and nrr were still high as 82 1 and 0 22 0 01 kg m3 d a real time monitoring system strategy that directly uses do nh4 n and ph was effective in stably providing optimal do 0 1 mg l and sufficient fa 0 1 mg l that capable in inhibiting selective nob activity microbial community characterization revealed that denitrifying bacteria indicate their important role in the improved nitrogen removal performance using in organic matter of reject water without another anoxic period under long term low do with optimal fa conditions the research results are expected to prevent the problem of unstable due to the substrate competition of major microorganisms and to reduce the deterioration within the ssd process due to excessive nob activity keywords anammox free ammonia nitrite oxidizing bacteria suppression single stage deammonification real time monitoring system 1 introduction the deammonification process is applied as an energy efficient reject water treatment process and it is focusing on a carbon neutral wastewater treatment process 1 2 the deammonification process consists of partial nitritation pn and ammonium nh4 n oxidation to nitrite no2 n by nh4 n oxidizing bacteria aob under aerobic conditions while anaerobic nh4 n oxidation anammox with no2 n as an electron acceptor by anammox bacteria amx and nitrate no3 n reduction by heterotrophic no3 n denitrifying bacteria under anaerobic conditions 3 4 these aerobic and anaerobic reactions can be successfully achieved in a sequential batch reactor sbr called the single stage deammonification ssd process 5 most ssd process has been widely applied for treating high strength nh4 n 500 mg l wastewater and currently has more than 150 full scale sites worldwide 6 7 however more than 50 of the sites using the ssd process experience deterioration caused by the no3 n accumulation 6 8 10 the complex processes with diverse microbial communities existing in one reactor became the major challenge of the ssd application competition for the usual substrate of major microorganisms occurs in the ssd process the experiences of deterioration are caused by the excessive growth of no2 n oxidizing bacteria nob 6 8 11 therefore it is essential to suppress nob activity to successfully and stably operate the ssd process in particular since nob coexists with aob and other microorganisms it is difficult to completely separate and operate in order to solve the problem several methods such as amx booster inoculation with nob removed high temperature 30 40 c operation and addition of chemical inhibitors e g hydroxylamine are applied 12 14 however these methods require high operating cost recently a method using a sensor of control monitoring is being applied as an effective method with a stable reliable and relatively low operating cost in general the using of ph sensor controlled the reaction time by indirectly monitoring the substrate depletion 6 the limitation in ssd process application occurs when no significant change of ph happened the reaction time using a do sensor was controlled by directly or indirectly checking substrate depletion 6 15 it was plausible to suppress nob activity by controlling with low do concentration 1 0 mg l according to the difference between aob and nob oxygen half saturation constants 16 17 when solely relying on the do sensor it will lead to excessive aeration due to sensor error causes nitrate accumulation damage to the microbial balance and prolonged process recovery 6 18 thus it is more advantageous to monitor the air flow rate and nitrogen compounds at the same time 19 additionally it was also possible to directly check the substrate concentration by using the nitrogen compound sensor nh4 n no2 n no3 n 20 it was also feasible to flexibly operate the reaction time in real time condition according to the microbial activity the ssd process applied to the actual wastewater treatment process the most operational problem was still related to the no3 n built up due to aeration control error 6 21 additionally with the wide load variation of real wastewater conditions there is a limit to the application of the existing process technology and the performance comparison presented the nh4 n is converted to fa form depending on ph and temperature in wastewater 22 23 the specific fa 0 1 1 0 mg l can selectively inhibit nob activity without affecting the activity of amx and aob 24 in most cases of high concentration nh4 n treatment the effluent is returned to the mainstream for final treatment thus the effluent nh4 n concentration is in high level over 70 100 mg l despite the high treatment efficiency of over 80 25 26 since the relatively high effluent nh4 n concentration maintains high fa concentration the fluctuations of fa are not considered however the changing in the properties of reject water that occurs depending on the operation and efficiency of each unit process sedimentation and sludge dewatering etc is the mixed reject water which is moderate strength nh4 n 100 300 mg l of influent in the ssd process 27 it can cause deterioration of process efficiency due to fa reduction and maintenance limits therefore if it is possible to continuously maintain appropriate fa by directly using the fluctuating nh4 n and ph it will be potential to secure an operation strategy that enables more stable inhibition of nob activity in the ssd process this study attempted to evaluate the optimal fa control effect on the long term stability of ssd treating moderate strength nh4 n wastewater 100 300 mg l the optimal fa control strategy focusing on real time monitoring ph and nh4 n under controlling low do ensure stable effluent quality despite fluctuations at influent concentration the research results are expected to prevent the problem of unstable initial construction due to the substrate competition of major microorganisms and to reduce the deterioration within the ssd process due to excessive nob activity 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum

the nh4 n and cod concentrations were monitored daily in at least one batch experiment the concentrations of these parameters were measured using an analysis kit humas co ltd korea with a spectrophotometer hs 1000 humas co ltd korea no2 n and no3 n concentrations were determined using an ics 1000 ion chromatography system dionex sunnyvale ca usa with a dionex ionpac as14 analytical column 4 250 mm mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were analyzed using standard methods 30 3 results and discussion 3 1 start up of the anammox process the nh4 n and no2 n in the influent were used by amx achieving about 100 no2 n removal efficiency and a total nrr of 0 66 kg m3 d fig 3 by decreasing hrt from 25 h to 10 h the growth of amx was induced by applying the gradual increase of nitrogen loading rate nlr from 0 35 kg m3 d to 0 85 kg m3 d the no2 nremoved nh4 nremoved and no3 nremoved nh4 nremoved were monitored for indicating the performance of amx after 260 days the ratio of no2 nremoved nh4 nremoved and no3 nremoved nh4 nremoved were 1 21 and 0 23 respectively which were not consistent with previous results 1 32 for no2 nremoved nh4 nremoved and 0 26 for no3 nremoved nh4 nremoved 31 1 146 and 0 161 32 1 133 and 0 161 1 3 and 0 242 33 however since the ratio may slightly depend on the reactor types and operating conditions and since ssd showed stable state it can be expected that the amx has occurred sufficiently in ssd process the amx was secured with about 0 5 kg m3 of inoculum for the ssd process 3 2 start up of the partial nitritation process the operation of the partial nitritation process was carried out reliably at synthetic medium and real reject water for about a month achieving a high arr of up to 1 11 kg m3 d in the real reject water fig 4a the nh4 n was stably nitritation about 50 from 373 to 160 mg l to supply no2 n required for the ssd process the no2 n was produced at 185 mg l and no3 n was hardly generated at 1 mg l fig 4b during the reaction the fa 0 4 12 mg l and the do 0 75 0 19 mg l seem to inhibit nob activity depending on the oxygen half saturation coefficients aob has a higher do affinity and is favored over nob at lower do below 0 3 mg l 34 therefore suggests that the partial nitritation did successfully perform in this reactor the aob was secured with about 1 6 kg m3 of inoculum for the ssd process 3 3 performance of the ssd process the optimal fa 0 1 mg l was successfully maintained and nob activity was effectively inhibited through real time monitoring control of nh4 n and ph in ssd processes with moderate strength nh4 n mixed reject water and influent fluctuations therefore the monitoring system strategy guaranteed stable operation and constant effluent quality nre 80 and nrr 0 25 kg m3 day 3 3 1 phase 1 day 0 40 start up of the ssd process the nh4 n was removed without no2 n accumulation but nh4 n and no3 n were accumulated in the effluent fig 5a the ph decreased rapidly due to the partial nitritation the ssd reaction time was preferentially terminated by ph control value of 6 6 thus the effluent nh4 n was higher than the control value of 20 mg l the ratio of no3 nproduced nh4 nremoved was average 0 19 fig 5a which was higher than the partial nitritation anammox theoretical value of 0 11 8 31 not only the amx but also the nob used no2 n produced by the aob despite the do 0 1 mg l the fa 0 1 mg l the activity of the amx was lower than the aob so the activity of the nob appeared in the ssd fig 5b there was a possibility of a difference in activity because the aob and amx had different inoculation amounts and the aob was 1 6 kg m3 three times more than amx 0 5 kg m3 the nre and nrr were average 74 and 0 20 kg m3 d respectively fig 5a 3 3 2 phase 2 day 41 244 effect of anoxic condition to inhibit nob the anoxic condition alleviated no3 n accumulation fig 5a the fluctuation of ph gradually decreased during the reaction fig 5b the ratio of no3 nproduced nh4 nremoved was gradually decreased to an average of 0 07 fig 5a which was lower than the partial nitritation anammox theoretical value 0 11 the no3 n removal was related to denitrification activity at anoxic or low do conditions 14 35 36 it is understood that the overall contribution to total nitrogen removal of denitrifying heterotrophic bacteria in this reject water is minimal due to a very limited biodegradable cod fraction see section 3 4 for details it promoted the amx activity and suppressed the nob activity during the anoxic period in addition despite large fluctuations decreases in the influent nh4 n concentration 100 to 250 mg l those were stably maintained nh4 n 20 mg l no3 n 10 mg l in the effluent the nre average 82 up to 85 and nrr average 0 18 kg m3 d up to 0 21 kg m3 d fig 5a 3 3 3 phase 3 day 245 286 optimization of the ssd process the deammonification became stable without an anoxic period those were stably maintained under 10 mg l no3 n in the effluent fig 5a the nlr and nrr gradually increased during the reaction fig 5a the ratio of no3 nproduced nh4 nremoved was about 0 06 which was lower than the theoretical value 0 11 8 31 also the no3 n removal was related to denitrification activity at low do 0 3 mg l condition 14 36 the optimal low do 0 3 mg l and fa 0 1 mg l were maintained stably and continuously through nh4 n and ph real time monitoring system which is effective in suppressing nob activity the average nre and nrr were still high as 82 1 and 0 22 0 01 kg m3 d 3 4 effect of real time monitoring system in ssd process a real time monitoring system strategy that directly uses do nh4 n and ph was effective in stably providing optimal do 0 1 mg l and sufficient fa 0 1 mg l that capable in inhibiting selective nob activity although ph do and nh4 n sensors are widely used for process monitoring in many studies table s2 each was monitored within each limitation range and fa was not considered however in this study they were monitored in combination with each other to maintain a proper fa range for nob activity inhibition and amx activity maintenance therefore this strategy has the advantage of being able to check a proper fa while monitoring ph do and nh4 n in real time so that the process can be operated more stably it can respond quickly to environmental changes regardless of the influent nitrogen concentration range in the previous report there was a reactivation problem of nob when long term operation at low do condition 37 38 however this result showed despite the low do 0 04 0 2 mg l simultaneous fa 0 1 0 8 mg l control was possibly reduced no3 n concentration and additional heterotrophic denitrification fig 6 on the 124 days the results of tracking fig 6a showed that when nh4 n was reduced by about 43 mg l approximately 8 mg l of no3 n was produced the ratio of no3 nproduced nh4 nremoved was about 0 19 which was higher than the theoretical value 0 11 on the 243 days the results of tracking fig 6b showed that when nh4 n was reduced by about 35 mg l approximately 2 mg l of no3 n was produced in the reaction cycle the ratio of no3 nproduced nh4 nremoved was about 0 05 which was about 50 the theoretical value 0 11 8 31 it could be seen that the concentration of no3 n production has been decreased compared to the 124 day tracking results it was possible to confirm that nob seemed to be suppressed although the effect of no3 n and cod removal on the anoxic period 30 min was insignificant it was thought that the anoxic period could promote the activity of amx 14 39 40 the organic matter removal is related to denitrification activity at long term low do conditions 2 41 it is understood that the overall contribution to total nitrogen removal of denitrifying heterotrophic bacteria in this reject water is minimal due to a very limited biodegradable cod fraction the fluctuations of ph during the reaction were small which means that ph consumption in the aerobic nh4 n oxidation and ph generation compensation in the anaerobic nh4 n reaction were simultaneously performed effectively building deammonification in a single reactor this is the advantage of not adding drugs required for acidity control in the ssd process 3 5 microbial community microbial community analyses were conducted to understand the variation in functional bacterial groups related to nitrogen removal with respect to the operational conditions a total of 618 693 otus were obtained during the illumina miseq sequencing under a 97 similarity limit table 1 compared with the inoculum biodiversity decreased in phase1 as shown by the decreased shannon index and inverse simpson index primarily because major functional bacterial groups dominated in the limited substrate and oxygen according to the continuous deammonification conditions on the other hand it increased in phase2 because the anoxic condition altered the nitrification and denitrification microbial community the microbial community analyzed at the phylum level showed that the inoculum was dominated by planctomycetes 22 7 proteobacteria 18 5 and bacteroidetes 14 1 compared to inoculum the amount of nitrospirae and chlorobi on day 23 phase 1 dramatically increased while finally nitrospirae decreased from 9 5 to 0 7 and chlorobi decreased from 17 3 to 2 8 on day 259 phase 3 planctomycetes are known to contain amx it decreased to 14 on day 23 phase1 but increased to 18 7 on day 259 phase3 the microorganisms responsible for the heterotrophic denitrification and autotrophic denitrification were identified in proteobacteria chlorobi and chloroflexi proteobacteria chloroflexi are known to promote granule formation and co exist with amx and heterotrophic bacteria 42 ignavibacteriae is a well known phylum that contributes to nitrogen removal by reducing no3 n to no2 n 43 genus level analysis provided a deeper understanding of microbial community variation fig 7b three amx genera were detected candidatus brocadia candidatus jettenia and anammox uncultured the dominant amx genus in the inoculum was ca brocadia 11 4 followed by anammox uncultured 8 9 on day 23 phase 1 the abundance of ca brocadia 3 6 and anammox uncultured 4 7 decreased after process stabilization on day 259 phase 3 the abundance of ca brocadia increased to 7 2 and anammox uncultured increased to 7 9 it seems that the stable maintenance of the fa concentration higher than 0 1 mg l in the real time monitoring system was advantageous for the activity of amx most of the aob sequences obtained were affiliated with the genus nitrosomonas its relative abundance in the inoculum was 11 6 and decreased to 3 2 on day 259 phase 3 this was possibly affected by the limited do 0 3 mg l as do concentration was controlled to be low to limit nob growth aob would have competed with heterotrophs to use the low concentrations of do the growth of aob would have been limited because of the lack of available nh4 n with a decreasing of influent nh4 n concentration 44 although the abundance of aob decreased the nh4 n oxidation efficiency remained high most of the sequences obtained related to the nob genera were nitrospira nitrobacter is another genus of nob was not detected in the results previous studies had found that nitrospira favors low do 45 46 thus the relatively low do in this study 0 3 mg l stimulated the growth of nitrospira rather than that of nitrobacter the proportion was small at 0 2 in the inoculum it increased to 4 5 on day 23 phase 1 but decreased to 1 3 on day 259 phase 3 it seems that the stable maintenance simultaneously of the do 0 3 mg l fa 0 1 mg l in the real time monitoring system was advantageous in suppressing the nob the possible heterotrophic denitrifying genera were ignavibacteriales bacterium 12 8 ignavibacterium 6 9 candidatus latescibacteria uncultured 3 1 and chlorobi uncultured 2 8 they may participate in no2 n production by reducing no3 n 43 47 although heterotrophs compete with aob to use oxygen they not only remove organic matter but also remove no3 n produced by amx or nob which can greatly enhance the overall efficiency of the ssd process 48 49 4 conclusions the optimal fa control focusing on real time monitoring ph and nh4 n under controlling low do and temperature of 30 1 c was essential for the stable operation of ssd process technologies and to treat moderate strength nh4 n mixed reject water 1 prevented unstable operation problems caused to no3 n accumulated by nob activity 2 stable low concentration effluent quality has been secured despite the influent characteristic fluctuations 3 additional dependent denitrification using organic matter contained in reject water was possible without a separate anoxic phase 4 effectively contributed to the balanced dominance of aerobic and anaerobic deammonification microbial communities therefore the results of the study provide support in selecting ssd process more economical efficient and stable long term operating technologies for moderate strength nh4 n of mixed reject water declaration of competing interest the authors declare
