5405,during the drought period 2012 2015 some of the major metropolitans and agricultural hubs within the southwest us including phoenix and tucson in arizona san joaquin valley in california colorado springs in colorado las vegas in nevada and albuquerque in new mexico experienced significant groundwater overdraft at the end of the drought grace based estimates of total water storage show a rising trend also the precipitation anomalies considering monthly averages over 2002 2017 are positive but it is unclear if a pressure equilibrium is achieved within the aquifer systems which is a requirement for residual compaction to halt to this end we perform a multidisciplinary multi resolution analysis of space borne and ground based observations we find that following the drought period and during wetter years due to reduced pumping owing to significant precipitation and the supply of surface water groundwater levels begin to rise at all sites while compaction of aquifer systems continues a multi temporal interferometric analysis of sentinel 1a b sar datasets during nov 2014 nov 2017 shows subsidence rates of 6 mm yr 3 mm yr 200 300 mm yr 3 4 mm yr 4 6 mm yr 2 mm yr affecting parts of phoenix tucson san joaquin valley colorado springs las vegas albuquerque respectively which are attributed to delayed compaction of fine grain aquitard layer we conclude that the aquifer systems did not reach pressure equilibrium at least within 2 5 years following the drought the data provided here can assist policymakers and urban planners to improve groundwater management plans in

processes including compaction of sediments under their weight meade 1968 dewatering of organic soil deverel and leighton 2010 liquefaction crustal faulting freund and barnett 1976 holzer et al 1979 mining lee and abel 1983 and fluid withdrawal poland and davis 1969 bau et al 2004 removal of groundwater causes an increase in effective stress total stress minus pore fluid pressure closing pore spaces within aquifer systems material which manifests in land subsidence galloway and burbey 2011 the land subsidence may increase the impact of flash flooding damage infrastructure and exacerbate impacts of sea level rise on coastal areas shirzaei and bürgmann 2018 eggleston and pope 2013 as subsidence and compaction continue tensile stress increases along the basin perimeter which is often bounded by consolidated impermeable rock holzer and pampeyan 1981 as a result hazardous earth fissures may form budhu 2008 holzer et al 1979 fissures are long cracks that widen with erosion over time posing a threat to structures in urban areas including building foundations railroads canals and levees furthermore changes in water stocks underground can alter the mass distribution near the surface and cause alterations of the gravity field detectable by gravimeters installed on the ground or onboard a satellite creutzfeldt et al 2008 rodell et al 2006 in the southwest usa fig 1 the majority of 56 million people live in metropolitan areas melillo 2014 and the population is growing by more than 2 every year the increased demand for potable water due to population growth has stressed the aquifer systems in the region additionally over the past two decades stronger and more frequent droughts have worsened the situation diffenbaugh et al 2015 usdm 2020 fig 2 reportedly more than 44 000 square kilometers in 45 us states are strongly affected by land subsidence anderson and woosley 2005 poland and ireland 1984 for which groundwater overdraft and an increasing number of land reforms are among main drivers in this study we investigate five regions across the southwest us that are historically subject to rapid groundwater loss fig 1 these regions include phoenix and tucson in arizona san joaquin valley in california colorado springs of colorado las vegas in nevada albuquerque in new mexico all of these regions were significantly affected by several droughts during the last two decades fig 2 here we perform a multidisciplinary analysis of the multi resolution space borne and ground based observations acquired by gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and sentinel 1a b satellites as well as estimates of precipitation anomalies and groundwater level changes similar to that of earlier works castellazzi et al 2018 castellazzi et al 2016 this integrated analysis of datasets with resolutions of tens of meters i e sar interferometric observations to hundreds of kilometers i e grace based total water storage variations and various temporal sampling rates enables us to investigate the recovery of aquifer systems during the post drought period namely wetter years when the supply of surface water increased and thus pumping reduced moreover it enables us to investigate whether the pressure equilibrium between the coarse grain aquifer and fine grain aquitard was reached at a given aquifer system during a period in which aquifer pressure equilibrates with that of aquitard despite stable or rising groundwater levels so called residual compaction continues to occur in this work we analyze and discuss the duration of the residual compaction for each study region section 4 in the context of their hydrogeological setting and pumping history see section 2 data types and methods applied for grace insar and groundwater level analyzes are outlined in section 3 2 study area 2 1 phoenix and tucson cities arizona phoenix and tucson valleys are part of the basin and range basin fill aquifers which are mostly made of unconsolidated and semi consolidated sand and gravels due to the arid climate and ongoing drought in recent years resulting in reduced annual precipitation and low surface water supply these areas experience water shortage fig 3 a data shown in fig 3a pertains to the combined area of both phoenix and tuscon given the resolution of grace measurements and that both aquifer systems show a similar response to the precipitation phoenix valley the major metropolis in arizona is located in the salt river valley in central arizona surrounded by several mountain chains the mcdowell mountains to the northeast the white tank mountains to the west the superstition mountains to the east and the sierra estrella to the southwest the valley relies on water provided by the colorado river and its reservoirs the much smaller salt river as well as groundwater resources recent studies have detected several subsidence bowls within the phoenix metropolitan area attributed to groundwater overdraft and residual compaction of the aquitard unit miller and shirzaei 2015 the city of tucson similar to phoenix also experiences a shortage of water supply land subsidence measured near the tucson downtown area during the period 1990 2010 is attributed to groundwater overdraft and subsequent residual compaction of aquitard units miller et al 2017 kim et al 2015 miller and shirzaei 2015 measure subsidence at rates of up to 20 mm yr at three locations in the east north and west of the phoenix valley miller et al 2017 report a subsidence rate of 8 mm yr near downtown tucson for the period 2004 2010 passage of the arizona groundwater management act in 1980 enhanced groundwater conservation plans and reduced pumping activities colby and jacobs 2007 tillman and leake 2010 jacobs and holway 2004 galloway and burbey 2011 accordingly the central arizona project used a canal to divert water from the colorado river to phoenix and tucson starting in 1985 and 2001 respectively as a result the reliance of groundwater resources was significantly reduced castle et al 2014 carruth et al 2007 jacobs and holway 2004 and the rate of land subsidence slowed down in the region miller et al 2017 report that the subsidence at the tucson downtown nearly halted through 2015 indicating the success of groundwater conservation plans noteworthy miller and shirzaei 2015 identify an uplift rate of 6 mm yr affecting the phoenix metro collocated with the site of groundwater recharge the ongoing subsidence and uplifts across arizona likely causes fissure and cracks and a program at arizona geological survey azgs is dedicated to monitor and document the formation of such cracks and fissures slaff 1993 2 2 san joaquin valley california california s central valley is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the united states and accounts for 20 of the nation s groundwater usage faunt et al 2009 over the last few decades the valley has been experiencing several episodes of severe droughts to fulfill the demand for potable water groundwater has been overexploited causing a widespread decline of water level scanlon et al 2012 xiao et al 2017 rapid land subsidence and permanent loss of aquifer system storage capacity shirzaei et al 2019 ojha et al 2019 ojha et al 2018 smith et al 2017 the san joaquin valley covers two thirds of the southernmost part of central valley and is situated between the sierra nevada in the east the diablo and temblor ranges to the west and the tehachapi mountains to the south galloway et al 1999 san joaquin valley aquifers are made of unconsolidated and semi consolidated sand and gravel poland et al 1975 report on 300 cm yr of subsidence from the 1920s through the 1970s affecting the southern central valley more recent work by ojha et al 2019 integrating insar and multi sensors geodetic techniques suggest that during the 2012 2015 drought more than 300 mm yr of subsidence was observed in tule tulare lake and kaweah sub basins from that they estimated a total groundwater volume loss of 30 km3 across the san joaquin valley due to the overexploitation of underground resources similarly for the 2007 2010 drought more than 250 mm yr of land subsidence in the san joaquin valley were observed using insar data which equates a total of 21 km3 water volume loss from the underground due to overdraft ojha et al 2018 here for the sake of completeness and for providing the reader with a comparison for the response of the major southwest aquifer systems to a recent drought we present a remake of the results given by ojha et al 2019 with new interpretations 2 3 colorado springs colorado the city of colorado springs lies at the boundary between the great plains and the front range of the southern rocky mountains and is part of the primarily confined denver basin sandstone aquifer system colorado springs is located at the southern edge of the basin in an area south of the palmer divide draining southwards to the arkansas river during the last decades the region s population has doubled this growth is expected to continue and it is supported by the basin s groundwater resources paschke 2011 in the past this area was also affected by widespread land subsidence associated with mining activities and possibly groundwater overdraft the significant period of mining activities occurred from the 1880s through the 1940s which was followed by the emergence of many sinkholes during 1937 1960 singh and dhar 1997 turney 1985 dunrud 1984 pumping related depletion of the denver basin aquifers was documented until at least 2003 through extensive groundwater model experiments paschke 2011 in 2004 the colorado geological survey assessed that artificial recharge of groundwater in colorado is a viable technique in many parts of colorado including the denver basin and they suggested guidelines for improving groundwater management paschke 2011 topper et al 2004 however there is no study investigating whether implementing these guidelines affected the ongoing land subsidence in the region although groundwater model simulation and predictions 50 years into future from 2004 paschke 2011 provide insight into the evolution of groundwater resources due to long term effects of groundwater overdraft observations linking the groundwater decline to land subsidence are scarce in the region as the basin s groundwater is nonrenewable and limited in quantity and has little possibility of recharge it is essential to monitor the hydro geophysical system to understand the depletion of underground water resources due to continued pumping and the links to the development of land subsidence in this region 2 4 las vegas nevada las vegas the largest city in nevada is a densely populated metropolitan area located within the hot mojave desert the town driest during june receives only about 100 mm of rainfall per year mostly during the monsoon season in august and slightly more during winter months the region is surrounded by mountain ranges and underlain by an artesian groundwater basin that belongs to the basin and range aquifer system the city s increasing demand for municipal water largely derives from the hotel industry and is satisfied by excess use of the groundwater resources king 2017 for several decades this was manifested in rapid groundwater level decline and ongoing land subsidence in different parts of the city with the maximum rates in the center and the northwest bell et al 2008 amelung et al 1999 in some areas groundwater level declines exceeded 70 m between 1912 and 1972 morgan and dettinger 1996 hoffmann et al 2001 and it reached 90 m by 1990 burbey 1991 galloway et al 1999 report cumulative land subsidence of 2 m since 1935 between april 1992 and december 1997 amelung et al 1999 observe maximum subsidence of 19 cm equal to 38 mm yr in northwest las vegas valley and 11 cm 22 mm yr around the downtown area more recent work by bell et al 2008 indicates a reduced rate of 5 to 10 mm yr in the northwest and the downtown areas as well as the uplift of up to 10 mm yr for areas right north of downtown these improvements were related to artificial recharge activities initiated by the las vegas valley water district in the late 1980s however reports by the southern nevada water authority suggest this recharge activity continued only indirectly through pumping restraints since 2009 snwa 2012 2 5 albuquerque new mexico north central of new mexico the albuquerque basin is formed by a north south oriented rift valley hosting the southward flowing rio grande stream which is confined by the plains of the llano de albuquerque in the west and the sandia mountains in the east the city of albuquerque is located in the north of the basin which is underlain by unconsolidated sand and gravel deposits driscoll and brandt 2017 albuquerque is the largest city in new mexico including more than 40 percent of the state s population uscb 2012 before 2008 municipal and agricultural water demands in the metropolitan area were nearly exclusively met by groundwater resources driscoll and brandt 2017 which lead to rapid groundwater level declines of up to 37 m during 1960 2002 bexfield and anderholm 2002 using insar observations heywood et al 2002 find a total of 10 to 20 mm of land subsidence in the albuquerque region during 1993 1999 to prevent further exhaustion of groundwater resources and related land subsidence the albuquerque bernalillo county water utility authority abcwua sought options to reduce groundwater use in december 2008 they began to supply the cities of albuquerque and santa fe with diverted and treated water from the san juan river watershed in colorado driscoll and brandt 2017 after that driscoll and brandt 2017 do not find any further subsidence in the albuquerque basin during 2005 2010 they instead observe uplift of about 28 mm east of the rio grande attributing this with the elastic recovery of the aquifer system 3 data and methods 3 1 precipitation drought periods information on changes in the natural water supply for each study area is derived via amounts and anomalies of precipitation data from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm the multi satellite precipitation product trmp distributes precipitation estimates at 0 25 0 25 spatial grid and 3 h temporal resolution from 2002 through 2017 the data set is accumulated to monthly estimates monthly precipitation anomalies are defined as the difference between monthly precipitation and the monthly long term mean over the period 2002 2017 subsequently a 12 months moving average window is applied to obtain a smooth signal which highlights precipitation deficits lasting longer than a year figs 3a 7a show spatially averaged monthly precipitation anomalies for the five study areas as defined by the grace data frames fig 1 to identify periods of drought for each study area we inspect records of the u s drought monitor usdm 2020 the drought monitor combines indices of meteorological below average amounts of precipitation for an extended period and hydrological the dryness of soils and rivers droughts the meteorological drought bases on the palmer drought severity index and the standardized precipitation index drought data are provided as an area percentile of a given us state that experiences one of five dryness classes abnormally dry moderate drought severe drought extreme drought and exceptional drought for our study we consider a region experiencing a regionally widespread drought if more than 80 of the respective state is classified by the usdm to be in moderate drought or worse condition also a region of severe extreme drought is the one with more than 80 of the corresponding state to be classified as a severe extreme drought or worse fig 2a e 3 2 total water storage variations in amounts of water stored on the continents are usually referred to as total water storage tws variations and they reflect combined effects of fluxes of water supply natural demand and human extraction tws variations are observable through high precision satellite gravimetry from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace at a spatial resolution of approximately 300 400 km for this study grace based tws variations are retrieved from jet propulsion laboratory jpl level 3 mascon data version 2 coastal resolution filter applied jpl processed the product based on a mass concentrations approach with 3 spherical caps watkins et al 2015 additionally gridded scaling factors are calculated by jpl based on hydrological models to correct for inherent smoothing in the data within a 3 3 mascon tile and they are derived from signal analyses based on hydrological models here we generate two tws time series one from the original mascon product and one from the re scaled product for the former we linearly interpolate the signal to five approximately 3 3 regions encompassing relevant areas of subsidence see fig 1 the re scaled tws time series is generated through averaging on the same 3 3 covering regions after oversampling the scaling factors on the original mascon product the difference between the two tws time series provides a measure for the uncertainty in focusing the signal to the study regions due to the inherent spatial smoothness of the data tws time series for each of the subsidence sites figs 3a 7a indicate the scaling related uncertainty is only relevant for amplitude but not for the timing of tws variations however one has to bear in mind that due to the limited resolution of the grace observations the tws time series is only representative for a larger area of at least 300 km surrounding the center of the study regions 3 3 groundwater levels a change in fluid pressure within the aquifer system is often reflected by a change in the groundwater level measured through observational wells here we consider groundwater level measurements at wells whose observation periods cover 2002 2017 namely the duration of our sar acquisitions as well as grace measurements locations are shown in figs 3 7 the data set is obtained from the u s geological survey which actively measures the groundwater levels usgs 2017 the analysis period of 2002 through 2017 spans several intense droughts observed in the study areas including a most widespread drought period during 2012 2015 fig 2 negative trends in the well time series correspond to the depletion of the groundwater resources whereas the positive trends indicate the recovery of groundwater storage at the well location 3 4 insar vertical land motion insar time series has been widely used to monitor deformation signature of crustal processes such as fault slip shirzaei and bürgmann 2013 volcanic unrest massonnet et al 1995 shirzaei and walter 2009 shirzaei et al 2013 and aquifer compaction galloway et al 1998 shirzaei and bürgmann 2018 miller et al 2017 ojha et al 2018 shirzaei et al 2019 here the maps of vertical land motion vlm at various sites are obtained from multi temporal interferometric processing of large sar datasets acquired by the european space agency s esa sentinel 1a b satellites c band for the period dec 2014 august 2017 over five sites in the southwest us see fig 1 and table 1 sentinel 1a and b satellites launched in april of 2014 and 2016 respectively the mission provides a short revisit time of 6 12 days among the different acquisition modes we used terrain observation by progressive scans tops mode of interferometric wide swath iws which is widely applicable for interferometric applications e g shirzaei et al 2017 due to its large swath width of 250 km at a ground resolution of 5 m 20 m in range and azimuth direction respectively torres et al 2012 to maintain the phase error of tops interferograms in the azimuth direction below 1 a co registration accuracy of 0 0009 pixels or 1 3 cm is required shirzaei et al 2017 shows that such accuracy is often achievable by using a standard algorithm such as matching which benefits from a digital elevation model dem precise orbital parameters 5 cm error in 3d and amplitude images to align the slave to the master image sansosti et al 2006 since the fine co registration of sar images is a crucial step in sentinel 1 processing often the approach of enhanced spectral diversity esd is applied to overlapping zones of adjacent bursts to improve the accuracy of co registration prats iraola et al 2012 however shirzaei et al 2017 show the accuracy of final deformation time series is weakly dependent on esd here we followed the procedure of shirzaei et al 2017 for insar analysis to obtain the surface deformation velocity map in this context we performed an advanced wavelet based multi temporal insar so called wabinsar approach for insar deformation analysis shirzaei and bürgmann 2013 shirzaei 2013 ojha et al 2018 following precise co registration of slc images to a reference image we generate large sets of interferograms considering perpendicular and temporal baselines of 200 m and 100 days respectively see table 1 column 4 we also apply a multi looking operator of 20 and 4 pixels in range and azimuth to obtain a ground resolution cell of 50 m 50 m a shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem of 1 arcsecond 30 m spatial resolution farr et al 2007 and precise satellite orbital information were used to calculate and remove the effect of topographic phase and flat earth correction franceschetti and lanari 1999 to identify the elite i e less noisy pixels the complex interferometric phase measurements are analyzed in the wavelet domain to retrieve the absolute unwrapped phase values we apply a minimum cost flow mcf algorithm adapted for sparsely distributed elite pixels assuming that horizontal signals are mostly due to tectonic processes with long spatial wavelength compared with that of vlm we also correct the effect of long wavelength signals by fitting a 2nd order polynomial to each unwrapped interferogram and removing its contributions shirzaei and walter 2011 we further apply several wavelet based filters to correct for effects of spatially uncorrelated topography error shirzaei 2013 and topography correlated atmospheric delay shirzaei and bürgmann 2012 subsequently we apply a re weighted least square approach iteratively to invert corrected measurement of unwrapped phase at each elite pixels and solve for the time series of the surface deformation and associated variance covariance matrix we further reduce the effect of residual atmospheric errors by applying a high pass filter based on continuous wavelet transform to the time series of surface deformation at each elite pixel shirzaei et al 2017 finally we estimate the long term los deformation rates and associated uncertainty in form of standard deviation std by fitting a line to the time series of surface deformation at each elite pixel since each data set is corrected for the effect of long wavelength horizontal signals we assume the remaining components are mostly due to vlm thus the los displacement is projected onto the vertical direction using the vertical coefficient of the satellite unit projection vector miller and shirzaei 2015 figs 3 7 show the obtained vlm rates for each study area which are discussed in the following sections fig s6 shows the spatial distribution of the estimated standard deviations for the los velocities at each site at most locations the estimated std is below 3 mm yr and only at san joaquin valley stds of up to 10 mm yr are observed those higher values correlate with the location of pixels affected by high subsidence rates see fig 4 however considering the areas that we do not expect any vertical deformation due to groundwater volume change we suggest that an std of 1 mm yr for los displacement is achievable using the framework mentioned above note that 1 mm yr represents the maximum precision of the measurements to further validate the estimated vlm rates we use the vertical component of gps measurements here we averaged the gps measurements within 3 days of each sar acquisition to mitigate some of the noise in gps measurements and obtain a time series with the same temporal sampling as that of insar measurement since the location of gps stations and insar pixels are often not co located we define an area of 200 m 200 m surrounding the site of each gps stations and average the vlm rates of all pixels located within this region which further improves the signal to noise ratio of insar measurements to account for the difference in insar and gps reference frames we choose a gps station as a reference and subtract its displacements from that of other stations similarly we remove the displacement of the insar pixel corresponding with the reference gps station from the rest of the insar datasets next we analyze the std of the difference between insar and gps vertical displacement time series at the location of each gps station for each study area see fig s1 s5 and fig 8 considering the gps measurements as ground truth the outcome of this comparison represents the accuracy of the insar measurements this analysis yields an std of 0 5 cm 4 8 cm and a coefficient of variation of 0 2 4 7 for the difference between the two datasets table s1 also summarizes the estimated insar and gps vertical rates at the location of each gps station given the small number of stations for each site we do not report statistics for the rate difference these estimates of accuracy and precision are consistent with that reported in earlier works shirzaei et al 2018 shirzaei et al 2017 shirzaei et al 2019 ferretti et al 2001 berardino et al 2002 4 results and discussion 4 1 phoenix and tucson arizona fig 3a shows the time series of tws change over the phoenix and tucson region as obtained from grace jpl mascons note that due to the coarse resolution of the grace observations we are unable to distinguish between the signal associated with each site large variabilities characterize the tws change time series during drought years 2002 2004 2006 2007 2009 and 2012 2015 compare fig 2a tws has a declining trend and even maximum peaks fall below 0 mm water equivalent i e below the long term average during a typical year arizona experiences summer monsoons during july and august as well as heavy autumn and winter rains the drought episodes altered seasonal rain quantities in the region which is evident from precipitation anomalies fig 3a black curves the negative anomalies indicate monthly precipitation fall below the long term monthly average also wet years are evident in both time series for example during 2005 2010 as well as end of 2013 and 2015 when almost two decades of recurring droughts were temporarily interrupted fig 2a during those wet episodes precipitation anomalies are mostly positive and tws variations show steep rises in the wet season however the effect of losses during dry season appears to dominate the signal after 2012 when tws variations become negative even during wet seasons with only a short interruption during the winter of 2017 while the tws change time series are not available after mid 2017 precipitation indicates intense water deficits in 2018 when almost the entire state of arizona experienced an extreme drought fig 2a in contrast groundwater level measurements at wells with continuous data across phoenix and tucson valleys fig 3c and 3 h are either flat or show a rising trend through 2012 indicating the success of groundwater management plans despite recurring droughts due to the passage of the 1980s effective groundwater conservation policy water levels mostly recovered and rapid surface deformation halted in both areas the well identification numbers are provided in table 3 within the phoenix valley well w1 in the south is characterized by 10 m of groundwater level rise during 2004 2012 well w3 near the center shows a sudden decline of 10 m from 2004 through 2006 which quickly rebounded afterward and remains steady with a slight rise up to 2012 well w2 in the northwest shows no significant variations during 2004 2012 since the end of 2011 when multiple drought years follow all three wells show a decline in groundwater level in the tucson valley the selected wells show nearly no declining trend during 2004 2017 despite the ongoing drought however well w1 located in the north shows two episodes of 2 m water level decline in the years 2015 and 2017 the difference in the site s response to drought can be attributed to less effective water conservation efforts in phoenix maps of insar based vlm rates across the phoenix fig 3b and tucson fig 3g valleys are obtained from december 2014 through june 2017 for the phoenix valley we find two significant zones of subsidence in the northwest and the southeast of the city with rates up to 6 mm yr fig 3b and d the locations are consistent with those for the period 1992 2010 reported by miller and shirzaei 2015 they also point out a zone of rapid subsidence to the north of the city at latitude 33 6 and longitude 112 3 which we also observe however at a substantially slower rate of 2 mm yr we further find a zone of subsidence to the northwest outside the phoenix perimeter with a close up shown in fig 3b and d the velocity profile aa fig 3e and d shows two significant subsidence zones in this region one at latitude 33 6 and longitude 112 3 with a rate of 4 mm yr and another one at latitude 33 55 and longitude 112 4 with a rate of 6 mm yr another primary subsidence zone is found east of the valley southeast of phoenix s center at latitude 33 3 and longitude 111 6 with a subsidence rate larger than 6 mm yr in the south outside the metro limit at longitude 112 1 and latitude 33 25 two other sites of minor subsidence 3 to 5 mm yr can be identified most of these subsidence zones are likely associated with nearby agricultural activities similarly in tucson a major zone of subsidence is noticeable in the south east of the city fig 3g and i the velocity profile aa across that region displays two significant zones of subsidence with a rate higher than 5 mm yr see fig 3i and j the zones are situated at longitude 110 85 and latitude 32 16 as well as at longitude 110 8 and latitude 32 12 fig 3i and j these deformation zones are also associated with farms and likely caused by groundwater extraction for agricultural activities time series of surface deformation at selected locations in phoenix valley marked by s1 s2 s3 and s4 fig 3f show a nonlinear behavior with little or no subsidence until june 2017 and then sudden subsidence of up to 6 cm is detected at all sites which is the cause of rapid subsidence rate observed in fig 3b the time series s1 shows an uplift up to 2 cm from january 2015 to june 2017 while the location experiences a significantly slower long term uplift rate of 8 mm yr in the tucson valley times series of surface displacements are characterized by seasonal variations with no significant trend until june 2017 fig 3k after that similar to the observations for phoenix valley rapid subsidence of up to 16 cm is measured through the end of the observation period a validation test fig s1 fig 8a and b and table 2 yields a standard deviation of 0 83 cm and 1 01 cm for the difference between insar derived and gps vertical displacement time series at sites in phoenix and tucson respectively to perform this validation test we average the displacement of insar pixels surrounding each gps station within a radius of 200 m 4 2 san joaquin valley california the temporal behavior of tws variations over the san joaquin valley reflects seasonal fluctuations and major declining trends following 2007 the region experienced two distinct drought periods one between 2007 and 2009 and another between 2012 and 2016 fig 2b fig 4a shows that the reduction in tws is higher during the last drought precipitation anomalies indicate below average rain from 2006 to 2007 and after that a wetter period until 2010 however from the beginning of 2011 until the beginning of 2014 the precipitation deficit reaches extreme values generated by a millennium drought which leads to severe water storage loss in the region the tws variations in fig 4a show a significant reduction of 400 mm water equivalent in 2016 precipitation values begin to recover to average values which results in recovery of tws evident from the positive trend after 2016 groundwater levels fig 4c continuously decrease during both drought periods indicating the severe decline in groundwater resources following 2016 groundwater levels begin to rise marking the end of drought period in the context of groundwater storage the map of vlm rates across san joaquin valley is shown in fig 4b for the period january 2015 to october 2017 a close up 3d view of major subsidence zones is shown in fig 4d and e the southern part of the valley is characterized by fast subsidence rates of about 250 to 300 mm yr which is visible in the velocity profile aa drawn across the subsidence zone fig 4e and h compared to that the northern region of san joaquin valley exhibits a slower subsidence rate of 150 mm yr as can be seen from the velocity profile bb drawn across the northern subsidence zone in the valley fig 4d g the time series of surface deformation fig 4f shows a period of rapid subsidence up to 300 mm yr between 01 2015 and 07 2016 in the following from 09 2016 the subsidence nearly halts and moderate uplift of about 10 20 mm yr occurs from 09 2016 until 10 2017 the earlier rapid subsidence coincides with the recovery of groundwater levels therefore it is not due to compaction of the aquifer unit but it is likely associated with inelastic residual compaction of aquitard layers ojha et al 2019 shirzaei et al 2019 the validation of insar based vlm against that of gps vertical displacement fig s2 fig 8c and table 2 shows a good agreement between both datasets with an average standard deviation of 4 8 cm for their differences 4 3 colorado springs colorado fig 5a displays tws variations for the colorado springs metropolitan area after an extreme drought in colorado in 2002 fig 2c seasonal variations dominate the tws time series until 2010 then between 2010 and 2016 the tws time series exhibits a negative trend and reaches its lowest values during a more recent widespread drought that affected the entire state of colorado between 2012 and 2013 fig 2c at the beginning of this drought period precipitation was well below average in 2011 and 2012 which negatively impacted the water resources of the region precipitation quantities returned to their average in 2013 but tws does not start to rise before 2015 when precipitation rises to values well above average fig 5a groundwater storage is similarly impacted groundwater levels inside the city decline since 2004 w1 fig 5c table 3 and they only begin to recover at the end of the last drought in 2014 which is consistent with tws variations fig 5b shows the insar based map of vlm rates across the colorado springs metropolitan area during the period november 2014 to august 2017 the map shows no major subsidence within the area but an uplift rate of up to 1 2 mm yr is observed northeast of the city center a close up of this uplift zone and a profile aa crossing through this area are shown in figs 5d and 4e several zones of subsidence at rates of up to 4 mm yr are observed at the perimeter of the city which are associated with agricultural sites where over drafting of groundwater resources may occur seasonal variations dominate time series of surface deformation at the selected locations s1 s2 and s3 fig 5f validating the insar based estimate of vertical land motion against that of gps vertical displacement we find a standard deviation of 0 71 cm for their differences see fig s3 fig 8d and table 2 4 4 las vegas valley nevada in the greater area surrounding las vegas tws variations fig 6a and drought conditions fig 2d are similar to that of california but show smaller amplitudes and severity in 2005 above average rain in the state of nevada ended a multi year drought however dry conditions returned just two years later the entire state experienced severe drought during 2007 and a long severe drought during 2012 2015 fig 2d following 2005 tws reduces then slightly increases in 2010 and by 2012 the rapid decline continues until a maximum deficit occurs between 2015 and 2016 following 2016 the time series of tws variation begins to rise the temporal changes in precipitation anomalies are correlated with that of tws and may explain some of these variations nevertheless due to the limited spatial resolution of the tws dataset its variations may also correlate to the large mass loss in adjacent aquifers within san joaquin valley this proximity can affect the tws signal for las vegas where drought timing is very similar but its intensity is significantly lower precipitation anomalies indicate slightly below average rainfall during most of the period 2012 2015 and only rise to slightly above average in 2016 groundwater level measurements fig 6c show a positive trend through the period 2002 2010 after that levels at wells w1 and w2 continue to rise until the end of the observation period however the rates slow done for wells w2 w4 following 2015 following 2015 the level at wells w3 and w4 become steady and only show seasonal variation the map of vlm rates distribution over the city from december 2014 august 2017 is shown in fig 6b wells w3 and w4 are located in a zone of rapid subsidence to the northwest of las vegas metro with rates up to 6 mm yr two further subsidence zones occur in the central part of the city at rates of 4 to 6 mm yr earlier studies have investigated subsidence in these three zones during the 1990s and early 2000s amelung 1999 bell 2008 fig 6d and e show the northern subsidence zone in 3d as well as subsidence rates along the profile aa crossing the zone time series of the surface deformation fig 6f at locations s1 s3 show seasonal variations consistent with that observed in groundwater levels this indicates an elastic response of aquifers to seasonal recharge processes note that the ongoing subsidence spatially coincides with wells of near steady groundwater levels which is an indicator of continuing residual conception of the aquifer system despite the introduction of pumping restrictions in 2009 snwa 2012 as for the validation test we find an average standard deviation of 1 23 cm for the difference between insar and gps displacement times series validating the quality of the deformation map see fig 8e and table 2 4 5 albuquerque new mexico in the broader region surrounding albuquerque variations of precipitation anomalies correlate with those of tws and thus both time series reflect the impact of recurring dry years in the state of new mexico during the last two decades fig 2e periods of recurring severe to extreme droughts 2002 2004 2006 2011 2014 2018 were caused by recurring below average precipitation and resulted in persisting declines in tws since 2005 which reaches the lowest values during 2013 2014 tws begins to increase following 2014 until the record ended in 2017 which was before the latest onset of a severe drought figs 7a and 2e the groundwater levels show a statewide decline following 2002 bexfield and anderholm 2002 the lowest levels are observed between 2008 and 2010 fig 7c however towards the end of 2008 and amid drought fig 2e the groundwater levels at well w1 experiences a sudden rise this sudden recovery is attributed to the onset of a surface water supply program which caused a reduction in groundwater pumping section 2 5 the response of groundwater resources to conservation plans is not homogenous across the region this is evident from measurements at w2 where apparent recovery only began in 2014 noteworthy during 2012 2014 the groundwater recovery at well w1 is interrupted by the intense multi year drought fig 2e interestingly the groundwater level measured at both wells shows a seasonal variation whose amplitude is nearly unaffected by drought periods measurements of vlm distribution fig 7b indicates that during november 2014 and august 2017 albuquerque experienced an uplift of 3 5 mm yr across its central and southern areas fig 7b and f this is further evident from the velocity profile bb fig 7f and g crossing through the central southern part of the city the groundwater level rise in nearby wells w1 and w2 during this period suggests that the citywide uplift is possibly associated with the expansion of aquifer system fig 7f and c this indicates that the surface water delivery program has sufficiently reduced groundwater pumping within the region reversing the direction of long term surface deformation from subsidence to uplift during the post drought years however some agricultural areas within the perimeter of the city are still associated with subsidence of up to 2 mm yr fig 7b and d these sites located at latitude 35 12 and longitude 106 7 along the rio grande see fig 7d the velocity profile aa across the region does not exhibit any strong deformation signal but we noticed a minor subsidence rate of 1 1 mm yr at latitude 35 11 and longitude 106 7 along the river which may be due to residual compaction of the aquitard layers the deformation time series at four different locations fig 7b and h show a seasonal fluctuation with a slightly positive trend at sites s1 and s2 the comparison between insar based vlm and measurement of gps vertical displacement yields an average standard deviation of 0 46 cm for their differences showing a good agreement between both data types fig s5 fig 8f and table 2 5 conclusion frequent droughts and growing population in the southwest us stress water resources and cause groundwater overdraft manifested in declining trends of total water storage variations measured by grace here we focused on five major urban and agricultural sites in the southwest us including phoenix and tucson san joaquin valley colorado springs las vegas and albuquerque and we showed that following droughts the land subsidence might continue for years even though different components of the hydrological cycle show a recovery which is evident from groundwater levels precipitation anomalies and tws variations this residual compaction is variable depending on local hydrogeology and pumping history within the perimeter of phoenix and tucson valleys we measured the maximum subsidence rate of 6 mm yr and 3 mm yr respectively in san joaquin valley subsidence of 250 mm yr observed in the southern part of the valley is associated with residual compaction of the system following drought period when groundwater resources were the main supply of potable water for farming activities in colorado springs the rise of groundwater levels during 2015 2017 indicates the recovery of groundwater resources following the drought we found no residual compaction of the system but noticed an uplift rate of 1 mm yr in the central area of the city in las vegas we found a subsiding zone with rates of 4 to 6 mm yr and near steady or rising groundwater levels from 2015 in albuquerque the groundwater levels exhibited a positive trend following the drought and uplift of up to 2 mm yr is measured in the south east of the city we suggest that the large datasets provided here may be

5405,during the drought period 2012 2015 some of the major metropolitans and agricultural hubs within the southwest us including phoenix and tucson in arizona san joaquin valley in california colorado springs in colorado las vegas in nevada and albuquerque in new mexico experienced significant groundwater overdraft at the end of the drought grace based estimates of total water storage show a rising trend also the precipitation anomalies considering monthly averages over 2002 2017 are positive but it is unclear if a pressure equilibrium is achieved within the aquifer systems which is a requirement for residual compaction to halt to this end we perform a multidisciplinary multi resolution analysis of space borne and ground based observations we find that following the drought period and during wetter years due to reduced pumping owing to significant precipitation and the supply of surface water groundwater levels begin to rise at all sites while compaction of aquifer systems continues a multi temporal interferometric analysis of sentinel 1a b sar datasets during nov 2014 nov 2017 shows subsidence rates of 6 mm yr 3 mm yr 200 300 mm yr 3 4 mm yr 4 6 mm yr 2 mm yr affecting parts of phoenix tucson san joaquin valley colorado springs las vegas albuquerque respectively which are attributed to delayed compaction of fine grain aquitard layer we conclude that the aquifer systems did not reach pressure equilibrium at least within 2 5 years following the drought the data provided here can assist policymakers and urban planners to improve groundwater management plans in the southwest and elsewhere keywords land subsidence insar grace gps groundwater level southwest us sentinel 1 1 introduction land subsidence may occur as a result of various natural or anthropogenic

impacts of sea level rise on coastal areas shirzaei and bürgmann 2018 eggleston and pope 2013 as subsidence and compaction continue tensile stress increases along the basin perimeter which is often bounded by consolidated impermeable rock holzer and pampeyan 1981 as a result hazardous earth fissures may form budhu 2008 holzer et al 1979 fissures are long cracks that widen with erosion over time posing a threat to structures in urban areas including building foundations railroads canals and levees furthermore changes in water stocks underground can alter the mass distribution near the surface and cause alterations of the gravity field detectable by gravimeters installed on the ground or onboard a satellite creutzfeldt et al 2008 rodell et al 2006 in the southwest usa fig 1 the majority of 56 million people live in metropolitan areas melillo 2014 and the population is growing by more than 2 every year the increased demand for potable water due to population growth has stressed the aquifer systems in the region additionally over the past two decades stronger and more frequent droughts have worsened the situation diffenbaugh et al 2015 usdm 2020 fig 2 reportedly more than 44 000 square kilometers in 45 us states are strongly affected by land subsidence anderson and woosley 2005 poland and ireland 1984 for which groundwater overdraft and an increasing number of land reforms are among main drivers in this study we investigate five regions across the southwest us that are historically subject to rapid groundwater loss fig 1 these regions include phoenix and tucson in arizona san joaquin valley in california colorado springs of colorado las vegas in nevada albuquerque in new mexico all of these regions were significantly affected by several droughts during the last two decades fig 2 here we perform a multidisciplinary analysis of the multi resolution space borne and ground based observations acquired by gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and sentinel 1a b satellites as well as estimates of precipitation anomalies and groundwater level changes similar to that of earlier works castellazzi et al 2018 castellazzi et al 2016 this integrated analysis of datasets with resolutions of tens of meters i e sar interferometric observations to hundreds of kilometers i e grace based total water storage variations and various temporal sampling rates enables us to investigate the recovery of aquifer systems during the post drought period namely wetter years when the supply of surface water increased and thus pumping reduced moreover it enables us to investigate whether the pressure equilibrium between the coarse grain aquifer and fine grain aquitard was reached at a given aquifer system during a period in which aquifer pressure equilibrates with that of aquitard despite stable or rising groundwater levels so called residual compaction continues to occur in this work we analyze and discuss the duration of the residual compaction for each study region section 4 in the context of their hydrogeological setting and pumping history see section 2 data types and methods applied for grace insar and groundwater level analyzes are outlined in section 3 2 study area 2 1 phoenix and tucson cities arizona phoenix and tucson valleys are part of the basin and range basin fill aquifers which are mostly made of unconsolidated and semi consolidated sand and gravels due to the arid climate and ongoing drought in recent years resulting in reduced annual precipitation and low surface water supply these areas experience water shortage fig 3 a data shown in fig 3a pertains to the combined area of both phoenix and tuscon given the resolution of grace measurements and that both aquifer systems show a similar response to the precipitation phoenix valley the major metropolis in arizona is located in the salt river valley in central arizona surrounded by several mountain chains the mcdowell mountains to the northeast the white tank mountains to the west the superstition mountains to the east and the sierra estrella to the southwest the valley relies on water provided by the colorado river and its reservoirs the much smaller salt river as well as groundwater resources recent studies have detected several subsidence bowls within the phoenix metropolitan area attributed to groundwater overdraft and residual compaction of the aquitard unit miller and shirzaei 2015 the city of tucson similar to phoenix also experiences a shortage of water supply land subsidence measured near the tucson downtown area during the period 1990 2010 is attributed to groundwater overdraft and subsequent residual compaction of aquitard units miller et al 2017 kim et al 2015 miller and shirzaei 2015 measure subsidence at rates of up to 20 mm yr at three locations in the east north and west of the phoenix valley miller et al 2017 report a subsidence rate of 8 mm yr near downtown tucson for the period 2004 2010 passage of the arizona groundwater management act in 1980 enhanced groundwater conservation plans and reduced pumping activities colby and jacobs 2007 tillman and leake 2010 jacobs and holway 2004 galloway and burbey 2011 accordingly the central arizona project used a canal to divert water from the colorado river to phoenix and tucson starting in 1985 and 2001 respectively as a result the reliance of groundwater resources was significantly reduced castle et al 2014 carruth et al 2007 jacobs and holway 2004 and the rate of land subsidence slowed down in the region miller et al 2017 report that the subsidence at the tucson downtown nearly halted through 2015 indicating the success of groundwater conservation plans noteworthy miller and shirzaei 2015 identify an uplift rate of 6 mm yr affecting the phoenix metro collocated with the site of groundwater recharge the ongoing subsidence and uplifts across arizona likely causes fissure and cracks and a program at arizona geological survey azgs is dedicated to monitor and document the formation of such cracks and fissures slaff 1993 2 2 san joaquin valley california california s central valley is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the united states and accounts for 20 of the nation s groundwater usage faunt et al 2009 over the last few decades the valley has been experiencing several episodes of severe droughts to fulfill the demand for potable water groundwater has been overexploited causing a widespread decline of water level scanlon et al 2012 xiao et al 2017 rapid land subsidence and permanent loss of aquifer system storage capacity shirzaei et al 2019 ojha et al 2019 ojha et al 2018 smith et al 2017 the san joaquin valley covers two thirds of the southernmost part of central valley and is situated between the sierra nevada in the east the diablo and temblor ranges to the west and the tehachapi mountains to the south galloway et al 1999 san joaquin valley aquifers are made of unconsolidated and semi consolidated sand and gravel poland et al 1975 report on 300 cm yr of subsidence from the 1920s through the 1970s affecting the southern central valley more recent work by ojha et al 2019 integrating insar and multi sensors geodetic techniques suggest that during the 2012 2015 drought more than 300 mm yr of subsidence was observed in tule tulare lake and kaweah sub basins from that they estimated a total groundwater volume loss of 30 km3 across the san joaquin valley due to the overexploitation of underground resources similarly for the 2007 2010 drought more than 250 mm yr of land subsidence in the san joaquin valley were observed using insar data which equates a total of 21 km3 water volume loss from the underground due to overdraft ojha et al 2018 here for the sake of completeness and for providing the reader with a comparison for the response of the major southwest aquifer systems to a recent drought we present a remake of the results given by ojha et al 2019 with new interpretations 2 3 colorado springs colorado the city of colorado springs lies at the boundary between the great plains and the front range of the southern rocky mountains and is part of the primarily confined denver basin sandstone aquifer system colorado springs is located at the southern edge of the basin in an area south of the palmer divide draining southwards to the arkansas river during the last decades the region s population has doubled this growth is expected to continue and it is supported by the basin s groundwater resources paschke 2011 in the past this area was also affected by widespread land subsidence associated with mining activities and possibly groundwater overdraft the significant period of mining activities occurred from the 1880s through the 1940s which was followed by the emergence of many sinkholes during 1937 1960 singh and dhar 1997 turney 1985 dunrud 1984 pumping related depletion of the denver basin aquifers was documented until at least 2003 through extensive groundwater model experiments paschke 2011 in 2004 the colorado geological survey assessed that artificial recharge of groundwater in colorado is a viable technique in many parts of colorado including the denver basin and they suggested guidelines for improving groundwater management paschke 2011 topper et al 2004 however there is no study investigating whether implementing these guidelines affected the ongoing land subsidence in the region although groundwater model simulation and predictions 50 years into future from 2004 paschke 2011 provide insight into the evolution of groundwater resources due to long term effects of groundwater overdraft observations linking the groundwater decline to land subsidence are scarce in the region as the basin s groundwater is nonrenewable and limited in quantity and has little possibility of recharge it is essential to monitor the hydro geophysical system to understand the depletion of underground water resources due to continued pumping and the links to the development of land subsidence in this region 2 4 las vegas nevada las vegas the largest city in nevada is a densely populated metropolitan area located within the hot mojave desert the town driest during june receives only about 100 mm of rainfall per year mostly during the monsoon season in august and slightly more during winter months the region is surrounded by mountain ranges and underlain by an artesian groundwater basin that belongs to the basin and range aquifer system the city s increasing demand for municipal water largely derives from the hotel industry and is satisfied by excess use of the groundwater resources king 2017 for several decades this was manifested in rapid groundwater level decline and ongoing land subsidence in different parts of the city with the maximum rates in the center and the northwest bell et al 2008 amelung et al 1999 in some areas groundwater level declines exceeded 70 m between 1912 and 1972 morgan and dettinger 1996 hoffmann et al 2001 and it reached 90 m by 1990 burbey 1991 galloway et al 1999 report cumulative land subsidence of 2 m since 1935 between april 1992 and december 1997 amelung et al 1999 observe maximum subsidence of 19 cm equal to 38 mm yr in northwest las vegas valley and 11 cm 22 mm yr around the downtown area more recent work by bell et al 2008 indicates a reduced rate of 5 to 10 mm yr in the northwest and the downtown areas as well as the uplift of up to 10 mm yr for areas right north of downtown these improvements were related to artificial recharge activities initiated by the las vegas valley water district in the late 1980s however reports by the southern nevada water authority suggest this recharge activity continued only indirectly through pumping restraints since 2009 snwa 2012 2 5 albuquerque new mexico north central of new mexico the albuquerque basin is formed by a north south oriented rift valley hosting the southward flowing rio grande stream which is confined by the plains of the llano de albuquerque in the west and the sandia mountains in the east the city of albuquerque is located in the north of the basin which is underlain by unconsolidated sand and gravel deposits driscoll and brandt 2017 albuquerque is the largest city in new mexico including more than 40 percent of the state s population uscb 2012 before 2008 municipal and agricultural water demands in the metropolitan area were nearly exclusively met by groundwater resources driscoll and brandt 2017 which lead to rapid groundwater level declines of up to 37 m during 1960 2002 bexfield and anderholm 2002 using insar observations heywood et al 2002 find a total of 10 to 20 mm of land subsidence in the albuquerque region during 1993 1999 to prevent further exhaustion of groundwater resources and related land subsidence the albuquerque bernalillo county water utility authority abcwua sought options to reduce groundwater use in december 2008 they began to supply the cities of albuquerque and santa fe with diverted and treated water from the san juan river watershed in colorado driscoll and brandt 2017 after that driscoll and brandt 2017 do not find any further subsidence in the albuquerque basin during 2005 2010 they instead observe uplift of about 28 mm east of the rio grande attributing this with the elastic recovery of the aquifer system 3 data and methods 3 1 precipitation drought periods information on changes in the natural water supply for each study area is derived via amounts and anomalies of precipitation data from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm the multi satellite precipitation product trmp distributes precipitation estimates at 0 25 0 25 spatial grid and 3 h temporal resolution from 2002 through 2017 the data set is accumulated to monthly estimates monthly precipitation anomalies are defined as the difference between monthly precipitation and the monthly long term mean over the period 2002 2017 subsequently a 12 months moving average window is applied to obtain a smooth signal which highlights precipitation deficits lasting longer than a year figs 3a 7a show spatially averaged monthly precipitation anomalies for the five study areas as defined by the grace data frames fig 1 to identify periods of drought for each study area we inspect records of the u s drought monitor usdm 2020 the drought monitor combines indices of meteorological below average amounts of precipitation for an extended period and hydrological the dryness of soils and rivers droughts the meteorological drought bases on the palmer drought severity index and the standardized precipitation index drought data are provided as an area percentile of a given us state that experiences one of five dryness classes abnormally dry moderate drought severe drought extreme drought and exceptional drought for our study we consider a region experiencing a regionally widespread drought if more than 80 of the respective state is classified by the usdm to be in moderate drought or worse condition also a region of severe extreme drought is the one with more than 80 of the corresponding state to be classified as a severe extreme drought or worse fig 2a e 3 2 total water storage variations in amounts of water stored on the continents are usually referred to as total water storage tws variations and they reflect combined effects of fluxes of water supply natural demand and human extraction tws variations are observable through high precision satellite gravimetry from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace at a spatial resolution of approximately 300 400 km for this study grace based tws variations are retrieved from jet propulsion laboratory jpl level 3 mascon data version 2 coastal resolution filter applied jpl processed the product based on a mass concentrations approach with 3 spherical caps watkins et al 2015 additionally gridded scaling factors are calculated by jpl based on hydrological models to correct for inherent smoothing in the data within a 3 3 mascon tile and they are derived from signal analyses based on hydrological models here we generate two tws time series one from the original mascon product and one from the re scaled product for the former we linearly interpolate the signal to five approximately 3 3 regions encompassing relevant areas of subsidence see fig 1 the re scaled tws time series is generated through averaging on the same 3 3 covering regions after oversampling the scaling factors on the original mascon product the difference between the two tws time series provides a measure for the uncertainty in focusing the signal to the study regions due to the inherent spatial smoothness of the data tws time series for each of the subsidence sites figs 3a 7a indicate the scaling related uncertainty is only relevant for amplitude but not for the timing of tws variations however one has to bear in mind that due to the limited resolution of the grace observations the tws time series is only representative for a larger area of at least 300 km surrounding the center of the study regions 3 3 groundwater levels a change in fluid pressure within the aquifer system is often reflected by a change in the groundwater level measured through observational wells here we consider groundwater level measurements at wells whose observation periods cover 2002 2017 namely the duration of our sar acquisitions as well as grace measurements locations are shown in figs 3 7 the data set is obtained from the u s geological survey which actively measures the groundwater levels usgs 2017 the analysis period of 2002 through 2017 spans several intense droughts observed in the study areas including a most widespread drought period during 2012 2015 fig 2 negative trends in the well time series correspond to the depletion of the groundwater resources whereas the positive trends indicate the recovery of groundwater storage at the well location 3 4 insar vertical land motion insar time series has been widely used to monitor deformation signature of crustal processes such as fault slip shirzaei and bürgmann 2013 volcanic unrest massonnet et al 1995 shirzaei and walter 2009 shirzaei et al 2013 and aquifer compaction galloway et al 1998 shirzaei and bürgmann 2018 miller et al 2017 ojha et al 2018 shirzaei et al 2019 here the maps of vertical land motion vlm at various sites are obtained from multi temporal interferometric processing of large sar datasets acquired by the european space agency s esa sentinel 1a b satellites c band for the period dec 2014 august 2017 over five sites in the southwest us see fig 1 and table 1 sentinel 1a and b satellites launched in april of 2014 and 2016 respectively the mission provides a short revisit time of 6 12 days among the different acquisition modes we used terrain observation by progressive scans tops mode of interferometric wide swath iws which is widely applicable for interferometric applications e g shirzaei et al 2017 due to its large swath width of 250 km at a ground resolution of 5 m 20 m in range and azimuth direction respectively torres et al 2012 to maintain the phase error of tops interferograms in the azimuth direction below 1 a co registration accuracy of 0 0009 pixels or 1 3 cm is required shirzaei et al 2017 shows that such accuracy is often achievable by using a standard algorithm such as matching which benefits from a digital elevation model dem precise orbital parameters 5 cm error in 3d and amplitude images to align the slave to the master image sansosti et al 2006 since the fine co registration of sar images is a crucial step in sentinel 1 processing often the approach of enhanced spectral diversity esd is applied to overlapping zones of adjacent bursts to improve the accuracy of co registration prats iraola et al 2012 however shirzaei et al 2017 show the accuracy of final deformation time series is weakly dependent on esd here we followed the procedure of shirzaei et al 2017 for insar analysis to obtain the surface deformation velocity map in this context we performed an advanced wavelet based multi temporal insar so called wabinsar approach for insar deformation analysis shirzaei and bürgmann 2013 shirzaei 2013 ojha et al 2018 following precise co registration of slc images to a reference image we generate large sets of interferograms considering perpendicular and temporal baselines of 200 m and 100 days respectively see table 1 column 4 we also apply a multi looking operator of 20 and 4 pixels in range and azimuth to obtain a ground resolution cell of 50 m 50 m a shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem of 1 arcsecond 30 m spatial resolution farr et al 2007 and precise satellite orbital information were used to calculate and remove the effect of topographic phase and flat earth correction franceschetti and lanari 1999 to identify the elite i e less noisy pixels the complex interferometric phase measurements are analyzed in the wavelet domain to retrieve the absolute unwrapped phase values we apply a minimum cost flow mcf algorithm adapted for sparsely distributed elite pixels assuming that horizontal signals are mostly due to tectonic processes with long spatial wavelength compared with that of vlm we also correct the effect of long wavelength signals by fitting a 2nd order polynomial to each unwrapped interferogram and removing its contributions shirzaei and walter 2011 we further apply several wavelet based filters to correct for effects of spatially uncorrelated topography error shirzaei 2013 and topography correlated atmospheric delay shirzaei and bürgmann 2012 subsequently we apply a re weighted least square approach iteratively to invert corrected measurement of unwrapped phase at each elite pixels and solve for the time series of the surface deformation and associated variance covariance matrix we further reduce the effect of residual atmospheric errors by applying a high pass filter based on continuous wavelet transform to the time series of surface deformation at each elite pixel shirzaei et al 2017 finally we estimate the long term los deformation rates and associated uncertainty in form of standard deviation std by fitting a line to the time series of surface deformation at each elite pixel since each data set is corrected for the effect of long wavelength horizontal signals we assume the remaining components are mostly due to vlm thus the los displacement is projected onto the vertical direction using the vertical coefficient of the satellite unit projection vector miller and shirzaei 2015 figs 3 7 show the obtained vlm rates for each study area which are discussed in the following sections fig s6 shows the spatial distribution of the estimated standard deviations for the los velocities at each site at most locations the estimated std is below 3 mm yr and only at san joaquin valley stds of up to 10 mm yr are observed those higher values correlate with the location of pixels affected by high subsidence rates see fig 4 however considering the areas that we do not expect any vertical deformation due to groundwater volume change we suggest that an std of 1 mm yr for los displacement is achievable using the framework mentioned above note that 1 mm yr represents the maximum precision of the measurements to further validate the estimated vlm rates we use the vertical component of gps measurements here we averaged the gps measurements within 3 days of each sar acquisition to mitigate some of the noise in gps measurements and obtain a time series with the same temporal sampling as that of insar measurement since the location of gps stations and insar pixels are often not co located we define an area of 200 m 200 m surrounding the site of each gps stations and average the vlm rates of all pixels located within this region which further improves the signal to noise ratio of insar measurements to account for the difference in insar and gps reference frames we choose a gps station as a reference and subtract its displacements from that of other stations similarly we remove the displacement of the insar pixel corresponding with the reference gps station from the rest of the insar datasets next we analyze the std of the difference between insar and gps vertical displacement time series at the location of each gps station for each study area see fig s1 s5 and fig 8 considering the gps measurements as ground truth the outcome of this comparison represents the accuracy of the insar measurements this analysis yields an std of 0 5 cm 4 8 cm and a coefficient of variation of 0 2 4 7 for the difference between the two datasets table s1 also summarizes the estimated insar and gps vertical rates at the location of each gps station given the small number of stations for each site we do not report statistics for the rate difference these estimates of accuracy and precision are consistent with that reported in earlier works shirzaei et al 2018 shirzaei et al 2017 shirzaei et al 2019 ferretti et al 2001 berardino et al 2002 4 results and discussion 4 1 phoenix and tucson arizona fig 3a shows the time series of tws change over the phoenix and tucson region as obtained from grace jpl mascons note that due to the coarse resolution of the grace observations we are unable to distinguish between the signal associated with each site large variabilities characterize the tws change time series during drought years 2002 2004 2006 2007 2009 and 2012 2015 compare fig 2a tws has a declining trend and even maximum peaks fall below 0 mm water equivalent i e below the long term average during a typical year arizona experiences summer monsoons during july and august as well as heavy autumn and winter rains the drought episodes altered seasonal rain quantities in the region which is evident from precipitation anomalies fig 3a black curves the negative anomalies indicate monthly precipitation fall below the long term monthly average also wet years are evident in both time series for example during 2005 2010 as well as end of 2013 and 2015 when almost two decades of recurring droughts were temporarily interrupted fig 2a during those wet episodes precipitation anomalies are mostly positive and tws variations show steep rises in the wet season however the effect of losses during dry season appears to dominate the signal after 2012 when tws variations become negative even during wet seasons with only a short interruption during the winter of 2017 while the tws change time series are not available after mid 2017 precipitation indicates intense water deficits in 2018 when almost the entire state of arizona experienced an extreme drought fig 2a in contrast groundwater level measurements at wells with continuous data across phoenix and tucson valleys fig 3c and 3 h are either flat or show a rising trend through 2012 indicating the success of groundwater management plans despite recurring droughts due to the passage of the 1980s effective groundwater conservation policy water levels mostly recovered and rapid surface deformation halted in both areas the well identification numbers are provided in table 3 within the phoenix valley well w1 in the south is characterized by 10 m of groundwater level rise during 2004 2012 well w3 near the center shows a sudden decline of 10 m from 2004 through 2006 which quickly rebounded afterward and remains steady with a slight rise up to 2012 well w2 in the northwest shows no significant variations during 2004 2012 since the end of 2011 when multiple drought years follow all three wells show a decline in groundwater level in the tucson valley the selected wells show nearly no declining trend during 2004 2017 despite the ongoing drought however well w1 located in the north shows two episodes of 2 m water level decline in the years 2015 and 2017 the difference in the site s response to drought can be attributed to less effective water conservation efforts in phoenix maps of insar based vlm rates across the phoenix fig 3b and tucson fig 3g valleys are obtained from december 2014 through june 2017 for the phoenix valley we find two significant zones of subsidence in the northwest and the southeast of the city with rates up to 6 mm yr fig 3b and d the locations are consistent with those for the period 1992 2010 reported by miller and shirzaei 2015 they also point out a zone of rapid subsidence to the north of the city at latitude 33 6 and longitude 112 3 which we also observe however at a substantially slower rate of 2 mm yr we further find a zone of subsidence to the northwest outside the phoenix perimeter with a close up shown in fig 3b and d the velocity profile aa fig 3e and d shows two significant subsidence zones in this region one at latitude 33 6 and longitude 112 3 with a rate of 4 mm yr and another one at latitude 33 55 and longitude 112 4 with a rate of 6 mm yr another primary subsidence zone is found east of the valley southeast of phoenix s center at latitude 33 3 and longitude 111 6 with a subsidence rate larger than 6 mm yr in the south outside the metro limit at longitude 112 1 and latitude 33 25 two other sites of minor subsidence 3 to 5 mm yr can be identified most of these subsidence zones are likely associated with nearby agricultural activities similarly in tucson a major zone of subsidence is noticeable in the south east of the city fig 3g and i the velocity profile aa across that region displays two significant zones of subsidence with a rate higher than 5 mm yr see fig 3i and j the zones are situated at longitude 110 85 and latitude 32 16 as well as at longitude 110 8 and latitude 32 12 fig 3i and j these deformation zones are also associated with farms and likely caused by groundwater extraction for agricultural activities time series of surface deformation at selected locations in phoenix valley marked by s1 s2 s3 and s4 fig 3f show a nonlinear behavior with little or no subsidence until june 2017 and then sudden subsidence of up to 6 cm is detected at all sites which is the cause of rapid subsidence rate observed in fig 3b the time series s1 shows an uplift up to 2 cm from january 2015 to june 2017 while the location experiences a significantly slower long term uplift rate of 8 mm yr in the tucson valley times series of surface displacements are characterized by seasonal variations with no significant trend until june 2017 fig 3k after that similar to the observations for phoenix valley rapid subsidence of up to 16 cm is measured through the end of the observation period a validation test fig s1 fig 8a and b and table 2 yields a standard deviation of 0 83 cm and 1 01 cm for the difference between insar derived and gps vertical displacement time series at sites in phoenix and tucson respectively to perform this validation test we average the displacement of insar pixels surrounding each gps station within a radius of 200 m 4 2 san joaquin valley california the temporal behavior of tws variations over the san joaquin valley reflects seasonal fluctuations and major declining trends following 2007 the region experienced two distinct drought periods one between 2007 and 2009 and another between 2012 and 2016 fig 2b fig 4a shows that the reduction in tws is higher during the last drought precipitation anomalies indicate below average rain from 2006 to 2007 and after that a wetter period until 2010 however from the beginning of 2011 until the beginning of 2014 the precipitation deficit reaches extreme values generated by a millennium drought which leads to severe water storage loss in the region the tws variations in fig 4a show a significant reduction of 400 mm water equivalent in 2016 precipitation values begin to recover to average values which results in recovery of tws evident from the positive trend after 2016 groundwater levels fig 4c continuously decrease during both drought periods indicating the severe decline in groundwater resources following 2016 groundwater levels begin to rise marking the end of drought period in the context of groundwater storage the map of vlm rates across san joaquin valley is shown in fig 4b for the period january 2015 to october 2017 a close up 3d view of major subsidence zones is shown in fig 4d and e the southern part of the valley is characterized by fast subsidence rates of about 250 to 300 mm yr which is visible in the velocity profile aa drawn across the subsidence zone fig 4e and h compared to that the northern region of san joaquin valley exhibits a slower subsidence rate of 150 mm yr as can be seen from the velocity profile bb drawn across the northern subsidence zone in the valley fig 4d g the time series of surface deformation fig 4f shows a period of rapid subsidence up to 300 mm yr between 01 2015 and 07 2016 in the following from 09 2016 the subsidence nearly halts and moderate uplift of about 10 20 mm yr occurs from 09 2016 until 10 2017 the earlier rapid subsidence coincides with the recovery of groundwater levels therefore it is not due to compaction of the aquifer unit but it is likely associated with inelastic residual compaction of aquitard layers ojha et al 2019 shirzaei et al 2019 the validation of insar based vlm against that of gps vertical displacement fig s2 fig 8c and table 2 shows a good agreement between both datasets with an average standard deviation of 4 8 cm for their differences 4 3 colorado springs colorado fig 5a displays tws variations for the colorado springs metropolitan area after an extreme drought in colorado in 2002 fig 2c seasonal variations dominate the tws time series until 2010 then between 2010 and 2016 the tws time series exhibits a negative trend and reaches its lowest values during a more recent widespread drought that affected the entire state of colorado between 2012 and 2013 fig 2c at the beginning of this drought period precipitation was well below average in 2011 and 2012 which negatively impacted the water resources of the region precipitation quantities returned to their average in 2013 but tws does not start to rise before 2015 when precipitation rises to values well above average fig 5a groundwater storage is similarly impacted groundwater levels inside the city decline since 2004 w1 fig 5c table 3 and they only begin to recover at the end of the last drought in 2014 which is consistent with tws variations fig 5b shows the insar based map of vlm rates across the colorado springs metropolitan area during the period november 2014 to august 2017 the map shows no major subsidence within the area but an uplift rate of up to 1 2 mm yr is observed northeast of the city center a close up of this uplift zone and a profile aa crossing through this area are shown in figs 5d and 4e several zones of subsidence at rates of up to 4 mm yr are observed at the perimeter of the city which are associated with agricultural sites where over drafting of groundwater resources may occur seasonal variations dominate time series of surface deformation at the selected locations s1 s2 and s3 fig 5f validating the insar based estimate of vertical land motion against that of gps vertical displacement we find a standard deviation of 0 71 cm for their differences see fig s3 fig 8d and table 2 4 4 las vegas valley nevada in the greater area surrounding las vegas tws variations fig 6a and drought conditions fig 2d are similar to that of california but show smaller amplitudes and severity in 2005 above average rain in the state of nevada ended a multi year drought however dry conditions returned just two years later the entire state experienced severe drought during 2007 and a long severe drought during 2012 2015 fig 2d following 2005 tws reduces then slightly increases in 2010 and by 2012 the rapid decline continues until a maximum deficit occurs between 2015 and 2016 following 2016 the time series of tws variation begins to rise the temporal changes in precipitation anomalies are correlated with that of tws and may explain some of these variations nevertheless due to the limited spatial resolution of the tws dataset its variations may also correlate to the large mass loss in adjacent aquifers within san joaquin valley this proximity can affect the tws signal for las vegas where drought timing is very similar but its intensity is significantly lower precipitation anomalies indicate slightly below average rainfall during most of the period 2012 2015 and only rise to slightly above average in 2016 groundwater level measurements fig 6c show a positive trend through the period 2002 2010 after that levels at wells w1 and w2 continue to rise until the end of the observation period however the rates slow done for wells w2 w4 following 2015 following 2015 the level at wells w3 and w4 become steady and only show seasonal variation the map of vlm rates distribution over the city from december 2014 august 2017 is shown in fig 6b wells w3 and w4 are located in a zone of rapid subsidence to the northwest of las vegas metro with rates up to 6 mm yr two further subsidence zones occur in the central part of the city at rates of 4 to 6 mm yr earlier studies have investigated subsidence in these three zones during the 1990s and early 2000s amelung 1999 bell 2008 fig 6d and e show the northern subsidence zone in 3d as well as subsidence rates along the profile aa crossing the zone time series of the surface deformation fig 6f at locations s1 s3 show seasonal variations consistent with that observed in groundwater levels this indicates an elastic response of aquifers to seasonal recharge processes note that the ongoing subsidence spatially coincides with wells of near steady groundwater levels which is an indicator of continuing residual conception of the aquifer system despite the introduction of pumping restrictions in 2009 snwa 2012 as for the validation test we find an average standard deviation of 1 23 cm for the difference between insar and gps displacement times series validating the quality of the deformation map see fig 8e and table 2 4 5 albuquerque new mexico in the broader region surrounding albuquerque variations of precipitation anomalies correlate with those of tws and thus both time series reflect the impact of recurring dry years in the state of new mexico during the last two decades fig 2e periods of recurring severe to extreme droughts 2002 2004 2006 2011 2014 2018 were caused by recurring below average precipitation and resulted in persisting declines in tws since 2005 which reaches the lowest values during 2013 2014 tws begins to increase following 2014 until the record ended in 2017 which was before the latest onset of a severe drought figs 7a and 2e the groundwater levels show a statewide decline following 2002 bexfield and anderholm 2002 the lowest levels are observed between 2008 and 2010 fig 7c however towards the end of 2008 and amid drought fig 2e the groundwater levels at well w1 experiences a sudden rise this sudden recovery is attributed to the onset of a surface water supply program which caused a reduction in groundwater pumping section 2 5 the response of groundwater resources to conservation plans is not homogenous across the region this is evident from measurements at w2 where apparent recovery only began in 2014 noteworthy during 2012 2014 the groundwater recovery at well w1 is interrupted by the intense multi year drought fig 2e interestingly the groundwater level measured at both wells shows a seasonal variation whose amplitude is nearly unaffected by drought periods measurements of vlm distribution fig 7b indicates that during november 2014 and august 2017 albuquerque experienced an uplift of 3 5 mm yr across its central and southern areas fig 7b and f this is further evident from the velocity profile bb fig 7f and g crossing through the central southern part of the city the groundwater level rise in nearby wells w1 and w2 during this period suggests that the citywide uplift is possibly associated with the expansion of aquifer system fig 7f and c this indicates that the surface water delivery program has sufficiently reduced groundwater pumping within the region reversing the direction of long term surface deformation from subsidence to uplift during the post drought years however some agricultural areas within the perimeter of the city are still associated with subsidence of up to 2 mm yr fig 7b and d these sites located at latitude 35 12 and longitude 106 7 along the rio grande see fig 7d the velocity profile aa across the region does not exhibit any strong deformation signal but we noticed a minor subsidence rate of 1 1 mm yr at latitude 35 11 and longitude 106 7 along the river which may be due to residual compaction of the aquitard layers the deformation time series at four different locations fig 7b and h show a seasonal fluctuation with a slightly positive trend at sites s1 and s2 the comparison between insar based vlm and measurement of gps vertical displacement yields an average standard deviation of 0 46 cm for their differences showing a good agreement between both data types fig s5 fig 8f and table 2 5 conclusion frequent droughts and growing population in the southwest us stress water resources and cause groundwater overdraft manifested in declining trends of total water storage variations measured by grace here we focused on five major urban and agricultural sites in the southwest us including phoenix and tucson san joaquin valley colorado springs las vegas and albuquerque and we showed that following droughts the land subsidence might continue for years even though different components of the hydrological cycle show a recovery which is evident from groundwater levels precipitation anomalies and tws variations this residual compaction is variable depending on local hydrogeology and pumping history within the perimeter of phoenix and tucson valleys we measured the maximum subsidence rate of 6 mm yr and 3 mm yr respectively in san joaquin valley subsidence of 250 mm yr observed in the southern part of the valley is associated with residual compaction of the system following drought period when groundwater resources were the main supply of potable water for farming activities in colorado springs the rise of groundwater levels during 2015 2017 indicates the recovery of groundwater resources following the drought we found no residual compaction of the system but noticed an uplift rate of 1 mm yr in the central area of the city in las vegas we found a subsiding zone with rates of 4 to 6 mm yr and near steady or rising groundwater levels from 2015 in albuquerque the groundwater levels exhibited a positive trend following the drought and uplift of up to 2 mm yr is measured in the south east of the city we suggest that the large datasets provided here may be

5406,artificial neural network has been acknowledged as a promising tool for accurately forecasting the streamflow however several constraints limit its application in operational hydrology the primary one being the non availability practically not available of observed streamflow to be used as input to the model in addition progressive reduction in forecast accuracy along with an increase in forecast lead time makes the ann model less amenable for operational flood forecasting this study proposes a hybrid model m4 that combines the strength of a physically based distributed hydrological model and a data driven model ann which purges the above concerns the proposed model was tested using two different case studies st i and st ii with respective time steps as fifteen minutes and one day while the first case study demonstrated the application of the model on a real time streamflow forecasting scenario the second one represented a continuous streamflow simulation the performance of the hybrid model was evaluated and the results showed that the proposed hybrid model m4 performed reasonably well at higher lead times nse 0 91 for st i and 0 77 for st ii at time step t 4 the proposed model m4 was further tested for its ability to work with forecasted rainfall synthetically generated using the data of st i and the model performed well with nse of 0 95 though the performance of the models was drawn only up to t 4 it was illustrated that the proposed hybrid model could be used to generate forecasted streamflow hydrograph corresponding to a full flood event well in advance this characteristic of the proposed model enhances its utility in operational flood forecasting keywords flood forecasting hybrid model artificial neural networks higher lead time forecast 1 introduction the occurrence of extreme weather events in several parts of the globe has increased plausibly due to a change in the climate scenario maity and kashid 2011 milly et al 2002 pachauri and meyer 2014 and this necessitates the need for effective flood management one of the essential requirements of any flood management programme is an efficient and accurate event forecasting system however literature shows that as the lead time increases most models exhibit deterioration in forecast accuracy bruen and yang 2005 dawson et al 2006 prakash et al 2014 while artificial neural network ann based models have been found to have better performance as compared to other forecast models badrzadeh et al 2015 campolo et al 1999 chen et al 2015 maier et al 2010 yaseen et al 2019 2017 2015 zhou et al 2019 those too experience deteriorated forecast accuracy at higher lead times therefore anns are presently not considered in operational flood management systems prakash et al 2014 to provide a reasonable streamflow forecast ann models require current and antecedent rainfall information along with antecedent values of streamflow as inputs to the modelling framework rajurkar et al 2004 several agencies across the world such as european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf national centers for environmental prediction ncep japan meteorological agency jma etc cuo et al 2011 provide rainfall forecasts with reasonable accuracy which can be used in the ann models for streamflow forecasting however at higher lead times the non availability of antecedent streamflow values to be used as inputs to the ann makes it challenging to preserve the forecast accuracy of these models though several researchers used the estimated streamflow values from the same ann model as antecedent streamflow for higher lead times in other words recursive input it resulted in accumulation of error in forecasts at higher lead times young et al 2017 though error correction procedures were proposed to overcome this difficulty chen et al 2015 prakash et al 2014 shamseldin and o connor 2001 it did not yield any significant improvement in the forecast accuracy especially at higher lead times the data assimilation methods fahimi et al 2017 madsen and skotner 2005 wmo 1992 also brought only marginal improvement at higher lead time forecasts hybrid models that combined the strengths of two or more modelling approaches were also proposed abrahart et al 2012 khashei and bijari 2012 maier et al 2010 srinivasulu and jain 2009 but no improved performance was achieved at higher lead times through this approach also a comprehensive literature study related to the use of hybrid models in hydrological modelling is given in the supplementary information see appendix a the methods such as the ones discussed above suggested for improving the accuracy of streamflow forecast at higher lead times primarily focused on improving the forecasted values by using different tools and techniques rather than addressing the root cause of the problem the primary reason for a deterioration in performance at higher lead times in anns or hybrid models is that the antecedent streamflow values provided as input to the models mostly the estimated values are not even close to the actual streamflow value antecedent streamflow values are essential in an ann model to identify the general shape of the hydrograph sudheer 2005 a significant error in the input that provides the shape would certainly deteriorate the performance of the model however anns are capable of handling some level of noise in the input information therefore if one can provide antecedent streamflow values with reasonable accuracy one may be able to improve the forecast accuracy at higher lead times a plausible option to provide reasonable estimates of streamflow at antecedent time steps short as well as higher lead time is to use externally simulated streamflow values physically based hydrological models are expected to provide a reasonable simulation of the hydrograph flood event in terms of magnitude and shape as they preserve the physics of the process reasonably well noori and kalin 2016 young et al 2017 though these may not be accurate enough to plan flood mitigation schemes consequently using these simulations as antecedent streamflow information to ann along with the forecasted rainfall may help to improve the streamflow forecast accuracy at higher lead times accordingly this study proposes a novel hybrid modelling approach for efficient streamflow forecasting at higher lead times this hybrid modelling approach combines a physically based hydrological model and ann by employing the external simulations by the hydrological model as input to ann for extending the lead time of streamflow forecasts although researchers have tried to use simulated information from a conceptual model as inputs to ann models their main objective was either to avoid the calibration of conceptual model noori and kalin 2016 or to give it as an additional information to the ann model along with the other observed inputs young et al 2017 to the best of the knowledge of the authors none of the works mentioned above focused on improving the streamflow forecast at higher lead times by considering only the forecasted rainfall information and simulated streamflow information from the conceptual models thus this study is a novel effort in developing a hybrid model to improve the effectiveness of the ann models in forecasting the streamflow at higher lead times two different real world catchments st i and st ii were selected to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model where each one was combined with a different physically based hydrological model while the proposed modelling framework was tested for its applicability in flood forecasting event modelling at a sub hourly time step in st i the framework was also tested for continuous streamflow simulation at daily time step in st ii the formulation of the proposed hybrid modelling approach is discoursed in the following sections 2 methodology the proposed hybrid model considers simulations from a physically based hydrological model that uses forecasted rainfall information along with the forecasted rainfall information itself as inputs to the ann model while any hydrological model can be used for this coupling this study used two semi distributed hydrological models i hydrologic engineering center s hydrologic modelling system hec hms developed by the us army corps of engineers feldman 2000 and ii soil and water assessment tool swat developed by usda and texas a m university arnold et al 1998 the rationale behind the selection of these models is that they are simple and easy to use and produce reasonably good streamflow hydrographs it is to be noted that the accurate simulation of the streamflow hydrograph is not warranted at this stage as these hydrographs as inputs to the ann is expected to help the hybrid model in realising the shape of the hydrograph sudheer 2005 the general form of the proposed hybrid model can be written as eq 1 1 q m t i f q sim t q sim t 1 q sim t j p for t p for t 1 p for t k where q m t i denotes the predicted streamflow using the hybrid model at time step t i q sim represents the simulated flow using hec hms swat at any given time i represents the lead time t is the current time step f is the nonlinear function fitted by ann p for denotes forecasted rainfall values and j and k are the lags considered for streamflow and rainfall respectively it may be noted that eq 1 is a generic form of the proposed model the antecedent values of rainfall as well as of streamflow identified as the input vectors for the model i e the observed rainfall streamflow information if available could be used in the initial lead time forecasts however as the forecast lead time increases the availability of observed information become none and the input to the ann model will contain only forecasted rainfall and simulated streamflow fig 1 illustrates the methodology used in this study to forecast streamflow values the hec hms swat model receives the forecasted rainfall information along with the physical characteristics of the watershed dem land use and soil and generates the hydrograph corresponding to the given rainfall event subsequently this generated hydrograph is provided as an input to the ann model along with the forecasted rainfall information to forecast the streamflow it is to be noted that streamflow forecasting using this hybrid ann can be extended till the time step up to which the rainfall forecast is available the details about the design of the ann model architecture are given in the later sections 2 1 case examples study watersheds and data 2 1 1 piedmont region south carolina usa st i the first watershed considered to illustrate the proposed hybrid model is located in the northern portion of piedmont region fig 2 in the state of south carolina usa spread over an area of 6 85 km2 with a mean elevation of 980 82 m the length of the mainstream in the watershed is 902 76 m historically this area had experienced some severe floods reported in the region including one event that occurred on august 25 1908 when the area received a rainfall amount of 180 34 mm in 24 h over the past few decades this area had undergone few significant events like the one during august 25 27 1995 287 02 mm and another one during september 13 15 2002 180 85 mm therefore an efficient flood forecasting system for the area can be one of the possible solutions to reduce the impact of the event in this area for setting up the hydrological model in this case hec hms digital elevation model dem of 30 m resolution was acquired from the website of south carolina department of natural resources http www dnr sc gov the soil data was obtained from usda soil survey data https www nrcs usda gov and land use data was obtained from multi resolution land characteristics consortium https www mrlc gov the watershed is dominant with residential 35 9 and commercial industrial 36 81 areas therefore any flooding may have a significant impact on human communities in this watershed the dominant soil textural class in the area is sandy loam four years of rainfall data 2013 2016 with 15 min time interval measured at the university ridge rain gauge station located at 34 84 n and 82 40 w see fig 2 was used along with the observed streamflow data of the same duration recorded at a streamflow gauging station located at 34 82 n and 82 41 w see fig 2 from the available data fifteen prominent rainfall events were selected to demonstrate the proposed model of which 12 events were used for calibrating the model and the remaining 3 for validation a summary of the characteristics of the data used in this case study is given in table 1 it is essential to check the statistical similarity between the calibration and validation datasets used for the modelling purpose maier et al 2010 the statistical properties of the selected rainfall and streamflow data in st i are presented in table 2 and they exhibit similar characteristics across calibration and validation datasets 2 1 2 st joseph watershed usa st ii the second watershed considered to validate the proposed model is st joseph watershed situated in the usa covering an area of 2800 km2 fig 3 and spread over three states michigan ohio and indiana the mean elevation of the area is 281 m and the length of the mainstream in the watershed is 100 km the purpose of selecting this study area was to demonstrate the application of the proposed model in streamflow forecasting on a daily time scale for setting up the hydrological model in this case swat dem of 30 m resolution was acquired from national elevation dataset https viewer nationalmap gov the land use and soil data were collected from the multi resolution land characteristics consortium https www mrlc gov and the natural resources conservation service s soil survey geographic ssurgo database https www nrcs usda gov respectively the watershed is dominated by agricultural 59 2 land use followed by pasture 20 7 forest 13 1 wetland 3 9 and urban area 3 1 meteorological information of this watershed was obtained from national climatic data center https www ncdc noaa gov for six stations angola 41 67 n 85 02 n garret 1s 41 33 n 85 12 w hillsdale 41 93 n 84 64 w hicksville 41 28 n 84 75 w montepelier 41 58 n 84 62 w and hudson 3e 41 84 n 84 29 w which are spatially distributed across the watershed see fig 3 the observed streamflow data was obtained for the usgs station id 04180500 located at 41 17 n and 85 07 w see fig 3 out of the total available data of twenty two years 1990 2011 ten years 1993 2002 of data was used for calibration and nine years 2003 2011 for validation the first three years of simulation 1990 1992 was considered as the warm up period for the swat model the characteristics of the data used in this case study are presented in table 1 and the statistical properties of the rainfall and streamflow data used are presented in table 2 both of the physically based hydrological models were set up using the corresponding watershed information the structural details of these physically based hydrological models hec hms and swat are not discussed in this paper as they were not critically involved in the primary objective of the paper readers may refer feldman 2000 and neitsch et al 2011 for more details on these models 2 2 identification of the ann model architecture selection of input variables is the foremost step in the development of an ann model structure galelli et al 2014 in this study the input variables considered were simulated streamflow information from the physically based hydrological model and forecasted rainfall information and the expected output was the streamflow at different lead times to identify the relevant input variables required in the ann framework this study used a correlation based technique where the input vectors are identified based on cross auto and partial auto correlations among the variables srinivasulu and jain 2006 sudheer et al 2002 wu et al 2014 for st i the auto and partial auto correlation of the streamflow data showed a high correlation among streamflow values at lags t 3 t 2 and t 1 with the streamflow value at time step t when tested for correlation cross between antecedent rainfall and observed streamflow data significant correlation 0 50 for antecedent rainfall values were observed at lags t 6 t 5 t 4 t 3 and t 2 with the streamflow value measured at time step t therefore in st i to forecast streamflow at time step t 1 the input vector consisting of p t 5 p t 4 p t 3 p t 2 p t 1 q t 2 q t 1 and q t were used a similar analysis was carried out in st ii where both streamflow and rainfall values at lags t 3 t 2 and t 1 showed a high correlation with streamflow value at time step t it is to be noted that in st ii the rainfall values used were the average areal rainfall calculated based on six rain gauge stations which are spatially distributed across the watershed thus the input vectors considered in st ii to forecast the streamflow at time step t 1 were p t 2 p t 1 p t q t 2 q t 1 and q t it may be noted that the time lags identified in both the case studies were assumed to be invariable at higher lead times 2 2 1 availability of input variables and modelling exercise in this study to forecast the streamflow at time step t 1 both observed rainfall and measured streamflow at time steps before and up to t were considered as available further some of the earlier models employed p t 1 which is the rainfall at time step t 1 as an additional input to the model along with the observed variables assuming that this rainfall information is available as a forecast when used for forecasting the streamflow at higher lead times t 1 t 2 t k the traditional ann models use only this available information as inputs into their modelling framework when a physically based model such as hec hms swat is considered externally the estimated values of discharge for the full event become available for use though with reduced accuracy these estimated discharge information at all the required time steps can be considered as part of the inputs to the ann model hence for making forecasts it can be assumed that the required inputs are available at all the time steps before and including t 1 which could be a mixture of observed and hec hms swat estimated streamflow along with observed forecasted rainfall information it may be noted that in this study to build the ann model for higher lead time forecast forecasted rainfall i e the rainfall values at time steps higher than t is assumed to be available for the examples demonstrated in this study observed rainfall values are used as pseudo forecast values with and without noise a detailed description of the model building is demonstrated using case study st i in the subsequent sections the available information at any given time step t that can be used as input to the ann model is presented in table 3 the ann model structure that forecasts streamflow at lead time t 1 can be written as eq 2 and eq 3 q m t 1 f q obs t q obs t 1 q obs t 2 2 p obs t 1 p obs t 2 p obs t 3 p obs t 4 p obs t 5 q m t 1 f q sim t 1 q obs t q obs t 1 q obs t 2 3 p obs t 1 p obs t 2 p obs t 3 p obs t 4 p obs t 5 where q m t 1 denotes the predicted streamflow using the hybrid model at time step t 1 q sim represents the simulated flow using hec hms swat at any given time and p obs denotes observed rainfall values the major difference between eq 2 and eq 3 is the use of the input variable q sim t 1 in eq 3 which is used as an additional input into the ann model similarly to forecast streamflow at time steps t 2 and t 3 the inputs to the ann will be a combination of the observed streamflow simulated streamflow from hec hms swat accompanied by observed and the forecasted rainfall values see table b 1 the inputs to the ann model for any lead time equal to and greater than time step t 4 will consist of simulated streamflow values from hec hms along with the observed and forecasted rainfall data as given in eq 4 and eq 5 q m t 4 f q sim t 3 q sim t 2 q sim t 1 4 p for t 2 p for t 1 p obs t p obs t 1 p obs t 2 q m t 4 f q sim t 4 q sim t 3 q sim t 2 q sim t 1 5 p for t 2 p for t 1 p obs t p obs t 1 p obs t 2 consequently to forecast the streamflow at any lead time step t k where k 6 the ann model structure adopted in st i can be expressed as eq 6 q m t k f q sim t k q sim t k 1 q sim t k 2 q sim t k 3 6 p for t k 2 p for t k 3 p for t k 4 p for t k 5 p for t k 6 it can be seen from eq 6 that when the lead time increases to t k the model uses only simulated streamflow and forecasted rainfall information as inputs similarly in st ii to forecast the streamflow at time step t 4 the ann model structure considered is given in eq 7 and eq 8 and it uses only simulated forecasted information q m t 4 f q sim t 3 q sim t 2 q sim t 1 7 p for t 3 p for t 2 p for t 1 q m t 4 f q sim t 4 q sim t 3 q sim t 2 q sim t 1 8 p for t 3 p for t 2 p for t 1 consequently the ann model structure to forecast the streamflow for any lead time step t k where k 3 for st ii can be expressed as eq 9 q m t k f q sim t k q sim t k 1 q sim t k 2 q sim t k 3 9 p for t k 1 p for t k 2 p for t k 3 in the case study st i the ann models for lead time step t 1 uses only observed rainfall information however as the forecast lead time increases the rainfall inputs are a mixture of observed and forecasted values of rainfall and from lead time step t 7 onwards the rainfall inputs are only forecasted rainfall note that the longest lead time for forecasts in any basin depends on the availability of forecasted rainfall information generally when the forecast for a rainfall event is fully available this proposed model could be used to forecast the entire streamflow hydrograph resulting from the event this potential of the proposed model is illustrated through the case examples a summary of all the ann model architectures considered in st i and st ii are given in tables b 1 and b 2 respectively the nomenclature used in this paper to represent the ann model structure for different lead time steps follows a general form mi t j where i denotes the model number and j denotes the lead time step the symbol i in the model name takes 4 values from 1 to 4 where each number indicates a specific ann input structure as stated below m1 the model that uses only observed rainfall information as inputs m2 the model that uses observed streamflow information with observed and forecasted rainfall information if available any m3 the model that uses both observed and simulated hec hms swat streamflow along with observed and forecasted rainfall information as inputs m4 the model that uses both observed and simulated hec hms swat streamflow along with observed and forecasted rainfall information as inputs the difference between the models m3 and m4 is that m4 uses simulated hec hms swat streamflow at the forecast time step as an additional input to the model to complete the ann model architecture identification the number of hidden nodes in the ann was selected based on trial and error method maier et al 2010 and both the case studies used a single layer of hidden neurons in the hidden layer in both the models the tangential sigmoid function was used at the hidden as well as the output layer to identify the optimal number of hidden neurons in the hidden layer the performance of the ann was evaluated by varying the number of hidden neurons progressively increasing from 1 to 10 and an architecture that provided the maximum performance was identified as the final one it is to be noted that the number of hidden neurons might vary with lead time step the final architectures selected in st i and st ii are given in appendix b see figs b 1 and b 2 3 model calibration and performance evaluation the ann model architectures were calibrated using amalgam optimiser vrugt and robinson 2007 and split sample validation approach was used to ensure the robustness of the model see appendix d as the first case study st i primarily focused on accurately forecasting the flood events the parameters of this ann model were estimated through a multi objective calibration method where the focus was i to maximise nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and ii to minimise the percentage error in peak flow prediction pdiff the performance indices used for evaluation of the models were root mean square error rmse relative volume error rve and error in peak time prediction etp nayak et al 2005 it is to be noted that the performance index pdiff was computed based on the simulated streamflow value at the time of occurrence of the peak in the observed hydrograph see eq 11 in the second case study st ii where the ann model primarily focused on the continuous simulation of streamflow the model parameters were estimated through single objective calibration by maximising the nse value and the model performance was evaluated using rmse and rve the mathematical descriptions of the performance measures used in this study are given below 10 nse 1 i 1 n q m i q o i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 11 p diff q m p q o p q o p 100 12 rmse 1 n i 1 n q m i q o i 2 13 rve i 1 n q m q 0 i 1 n q o 14 et p t m p t o p where q m and q o represents the simulated and observed streamflow q o is the average of observed streamflow n is the total number of data points t m p and t o p indicates the time taken to reach the peak magnitude of the simulated and observed flow respectively q 0 p is the observed peak flow and q m p is the simulated streamflow at the time of the observed peak flow 4 results and discussion 4 1 performance evaluation of models for st i 4 1 1 validation of the hec hms model given that the use of simulated streamflow from hec hms was not to create an accurate simulation of the event hydrograph the hec hms model was not fully calibrated in this study instead the parameter curve number cn was slightly refined from the default value to get a satisfactory simulation of the streamflow hydrograph the performance measures estimated based on the simulations of the hec hms are presented in table 4 the model simulated the streamflow hydrograph satisfactorily with an nse of 0 67 for both calibration and validation data see table 4 however the simulated hydrographs from hec hms were not able to preserve the accuracy in peak time prediction up to 1200 min in the calibration data and up to 45 min in the validation data it may be noted that the values mentioned above are the estimated average across the events considered for both calibration and validation a similar deterioration in performance was observed while predicting the peak flow magnitude as well see table 4 scatter plots comparing the simulated streamflow from hec hms and the corresponding observed values for the calibration and validation events are presented in fig 4 a and 4b it is evident from fig 4 that the hec hms simulations are reasonably good though the model over predicts the peak flows these simulations were expected to improve the forecast accuracy of ann at higher lead times the simulated hydrograph from hec hms was fed into the hybrid ann model though different ann model architectures were built and evaluated in this study only the results of models m3 and m4 at lead time step t 4 are discussed in this section it is mainly because at this time step the ann models m3 and m4 use only simulated streamflow information from hec hms along with antecedent rainfall values as inputs the performance of other models i e m1 m2 m3 and m4 for lead time steps from t 1 to t 3 are given in the supplementary information see table c 1 4 1 2 performance of hybrid model at lead time step t 4 for st i the ann based hybrid model that forecasts streamflow at lead time step t 4 and above primarily uses simulated values of streamflow variables both the models m3t 4 and m4t 4 exhibited similar performance though m4t 4 performed slightly better than m3t 4 the model performances measured using different performance indices are given in table 5 the nse values corresponding to the performance of m3t 4 were 0 84 and 0 87 respectively during calibration and validation and the corresponding values for m4t 4 were 0 87 and 0 91 respectively the error in the prediction of peak magnitude i e pdiff for the model m3t 4 was ranging between 41 03 to 6 85 during calibration and 30 09 to 1 10 during validation see fig c 1 etp another index which measures the error in predicting the time of occurrence of peak magnitude was falling within the range of 0 to 5 timestep 0 to 75 min for a majority of the events used in the calibration as well as validation of the same model a similar analysis for the model m4t 4 showed the values of pdiff were ranging between 37 48 to 13 60 and 37 73 to 31 61 during calibration and validation respectively whereas etp was ranging from 0 to 5 timesteps 0 to 75 min and 0 to 4 timesteps 0 to 60 min for both calibration and validation respectively other performance measures like rmse and rve were estimated as 0 48 m3 s 0 31 and 0 30 m3 s 0 12 for the model m3t 4 during calibration and validation respectively whereas the performance of the model m4t 4 based on the same indices were reported as 0 44 m3 s 0 27 and 0 24 m3 s 0 12 for the respective periods the scatter plots depicting the performance of m3t 4 and m4t 4 are presented in fig 5 while model m4t 4 maintains a uniform scatter around the ideal line during calibration fig 5c model m3t 4 slightly underpredicted the peak flows during the same period fig 5a a similar overprediction was observed during the validation of m3t 4 fig 5b and a uniform scatter observed for the model m4t 4 fig 5d during the same period while model m4t 4 simulated peak flow more accurately as compared to m3t 4 during calibration it slightly over predicted the peak values compared to the latter during validation it can be further explained with the help of figs 6 and 8 which shows the event hydrographs forecasted by the models m3t 4 and m4t 4 respectively the hydrographs showed a fair agreement with the observed data with a slightly overestimated peak in m4t 4 see fig 8 4 1 3 performance of hybrid model for st i at higher lead times t 4 a specific advantage of the proposed hybrid model is that it can be used for forecasting the streamflow at higher lead times t 4 i e up to the end of the hydrograph event figure 7 illustrates the procedure for employing the hybrid model for forecasting the whole hydrograph as mentioned earlier the hybrid models for lead time equal to or higher than t 4 use rainfall information either observed p obs or forecasted p for as inputs along with the simulated streamflow information from the hec hms m3 m4 note that the forecasted rainfall information can be used instead of observed rainfall if available figure 8 shows the hydrograph forecasted using the model m4t 4 and it can be observed that the hydrograph forecasted by this model preserved the shape of the hydrograph better as compared to the one simulated by m3t 4 see fig 6 this improvement can be attributed to the additional input information the simulated streamflow using hec hms at time step t 4 i e q sim t 4 used in m4t 4 as compared to that used in m3t 4 these results reinforce the suggestions by sudheer 2005 as well as jain et al 2004 that the antecedent discharge information as input to ann models helps them preserve the shape of the hydrograph when the lead time increases to t 5 recent information from the available data observed and forecasted rainfall combined with streamflow from hec hms was used as inputs to the model as these models m3 and m4 uses forecasted information of rainfall it is apparent that these models can be used for forecasting the full event hydrograph much earlier at the time i e at time step t itself in other words when forecasted precipitation information is known the expected flood hydrograph can be effectively generated by the m4t 4 or m3t 4 though with slightly lower accuracy irrespective of the base period of the flood event this characteristic of the hybrid ann model makes it effective for operational flood management 4 2 performance evaluation hybrid ann model for st ii 4 2 1 validation of the swat model as mentioned earlier in the second case study st ii swat model was used to generate daily streamflow information in the st joseph watershed the performance of the swat model is summarized in table 6 it may be noted that in this study the swat model setup used the calibrated swat parameters obtained from femeena et al 2018 the model performed satisfactorily see table 6 with nse of 0 74 and 0 80 during the calibration and validation period respectively figure 9 shows the scatterplots comparing the simulated and observed streamflow values for the calibration and validation data with the calibration and validation data swat in general under predicted the streamflow values as mentioned in section 4 1 1 swat simulations need not give an accurate estimation of the streamflow values instead these values will be used as an input to the ann model to guide the shape of the hydrograph and improve the forecast accuracy of the hybrid ann models 4 2 2 performance of hybrid model for st ii at lead time step t 4 the hybrid model for st ii that uses streamflow values simulated using the swat model and the antecedent rainfall values as inputs was calibrated and validated for different lead time steps the details of the model architectures are given in table b 2 similar to the hybrid model for st i the hybrid model for st ii was able to perform consistently at time step t 4 the performance of both the models at time step t 4 i e m3t 4 and m4t 4 are summarised in table 5 the model m3t 4 reported an efficiency nse of 0 77 during calibration and 0 76 during validation whereas the efficiency of model m4t 4 was reported as 0 81 and 0 77 for the respective periods on evaluating the model performance based on rmse and rve the m3t 4 model reported the respective values as 19 36 m3 s 0 00 during calibration and 20 80 m3 s 0 09 during validation for the same indices m4t 4 model reported 17 36 m3 s 0 01 and 20 20 m3 s 0 12 as values during calibration and validation respectively the performance of both the models was visually compared using scatter plots shown in fig 10 it is evident from the scatter plots that the hybrid model performed better than the swat model with smaller spread across the ideal line during both calibration and validation even though the peak flows were estimated satisfactorily during calibration it was over predicted during validation see fig 10a to 10d on comparing the performance of m3t 4 and m4t 4 the model which uses the most recent streamflow information as an additional input to the ann model performed consistently with the increase in lead time similar to the case of the m4t 4 model in st i these models m4 are expected to show improved performance as long as reasonably accurate rainfall forecast is available 4 3 hybrid model with forecasted precipitation for st i the models discussed earlier considered observed precipitation values as pseudo forecasts however in reality the forecasted precipitation may have a specific anomaly from the observed though ann is capable of handling the noise in the input data the effect of this anomaly on the forecasted flood event needs to be verified consequently an analysis was done by adding some amount of white noise to the observed precipitation so as to consider it as a replacement for the actual forecasted values synthetic forecasted rainfall information and by simulating the flood event for the forecasted precipitation this exercise was undertaken for a selected rainfall event in the validation data set of the first case study wherein normal random noise with 2 variance was added to the rainfall data magnitude of the error ranging between 0 61 mm to 0 96 mm in 15 min time interval to generate a synthetic forecasted rainfall data the event was simulated using the model m4 and the simulated hydrograph is presented in fig 11 along with the observed hydrograph corresponding to the event and the simulated hydrograph using hec hms from fig 11 it can be observed that the proposed hybrid ann model was able to contain the noise generated by the forecasted rainfall as expected the simulated hydrograph from hec hms cannot be directly used for flood management since it failed to capture specific properties of the hydrograph particularly the multiple peaks and the recession limb on evaluating the performance of the model using different indices the m4 model showed an efficiency nse of 0 95 with pdiff and etp as 4 18 and 15 min respectively a similar exercise was carried out by increasing the variance of the noise in the synthetically forecasted rainfall to 5 and the results indicated that the performance of the model m4 was consistent nse 0 94 and pdiff 3 49 the details of the analysis of results are not presented herein for brevity this exercise was further continued by adding noise into the observed rainfall data in a gradual manner up to an error variance of 9 where the model performance was found to result in nse of 0 50 the deterioration in performance could be considered as a limitation of the hybrid model that the model may not work efficiently if the rainfall forecasts have larger error 4 4 the relative importance of inputs in the hybrid model for st i at time step t 4 it is evident from the performance of the proposed hybrid models that in each ann model the performance varies with respect to the adopted input architecture to study the effect of the adopted input architecture in the ann model an analysis was carried out to compute the relative importance of the inputs used in the ann modelling framework the method used for the analysis was adopted from garson 1991 where the researcher made an effort to physically interpret the working of the ann models based on the weights connecting the input hidden layer and hidden output layer of a trained ann model this method is based on the premise that the input information employed for developing the process relationship do contain vital information about the process being modelled this method envisages that the relative importance of each of the input variable can be assessed by interpreting the connection weights of the trained ann model this is achieved by appropriately combining the strength of all the connections of an input variable to the output including those through the hidden nodes a detailed explanation of the methodology is given in jain et al 2008 though this method was considered as a model validation technique in a few studies humphrey et al 2017 this study used it to quantify the relative importance given to the inputs used in the ann model the rationale behind this analysis was to understand the contribution from the hec hms swat simulated streamflow in improving the forecasted streamflow the ann model parameters pertaining to the optimal solution from the model calibration were considered for the specific analysis fig 12 depicts the relative importance given to the individual inputs in models m3t 4 and m4t 4 it is to be noted that while comparing the relative importance of the inputs used in this study the authors have considered the relative importance of the streamflow variables as a significant factor as compared to the rainfall variables due to the high correlation between the streamflow variables it was observed from the figure fig 12 that in m3t 4 amongst all the inputs considered primary importance was given to the recent information used in that particular time step i e q sim t 3 and in m4t 4 it was given to the streamflow variable q sim t 4 resulting in an improvement in the performance of the model it is worth noting that on analysing the ann model parameters for the final 100 solutions of the model calibration the relative importance exhibited by each ann model input followed the same trend as perceived by the optimal solution 4 5 comparison of the performance of hybrid models for st i and st ii with traditional ann models taylor plots that compare the performance of all the models considered at each time step listed in tables b 1 and b 2 are shown in fig 13 a taylor plot illustrates the model performance based on three statistical measures which are correlation coefficient standard deviation and root mean square error rmse from fig 13a it can be observed that all the models considered at time step t 1 were characterised with similar statistical properties irrespective of the inputs considered in the ann model structure as the lead time increases to t 2 fig 13b the performance of the traditional ann model m2t 2 which uses the antecedent streamflow values along with antecedent rainfall values as inputs deteriorated in terms of rmse and correlation coefficient this deteriorated performance is due to the non availability of the observed streamflow values beyond time step t which was required to be given as input to the traditional ann model the lack of recent information dampened the performance of the traditional ann model which was again reflected in the performance of the model m2t 3 fig 13c as the lead time step increases to t 4 fig 13d only two ann models were considered for the forecast i e m3t 4 and m4t 4 where the latter one outperformed the former such a noticeable difference in the performance of the models could be due to the additional input used in the model m4t 4 i e simulated streamflow from hec hms at time step t 4 which is the forecast time step fig 14 compares the performance of all the models considered in both the case studies in terms of nse values in both case studies the m1 model which receives only the rainfall information as input into the ann model showed the lowest performance amongst all the models see fig 14a and 14b such reduced performance was observed by various researchers campolo et al 1999 minns and hall 1996 where rainfall information alone was used as input into the ann model the m2 models which follow the traditional ann model architecture performed better than the hybrid models at time step t 1 however with further increase in lead time the performance of m2 models degraded gradually which can be attributed to the unavailability of the observed streamflow information to be used as input to the ann model the m3 models which follow the input architecture of the traditional ann model but with simulated streamflow from hec hms as input at time steps above t 1 showed a relatively consistent performance at different lead time steps considering the availability of simulated streamflow data at the time of the forecast the hybrid model m4 was proposed and the performance of these models was more consistent throughout the flood event forecast as mentioned earlier m4 models can be employed to generate the entire flood hydrograph event from time t itself with consistent performance the combined modelling effort using a physically based hydrological model and a data driven model showed significant improvement in performance as compared to the traditional method of using ann for streamflow forecasting as hypothesized the simulations from hec hms helped the ann model to capture the flow characteristics of the basin young et al 2017 with the increase in the forecast lead time and in the absence of the observed flow values ann was able to capture the flow characteristics in terms of peak streamflow magnitude and time of occurrence of the peak due to its ability to capture the non linear nature of the process as observed by kashani et al 2014 the forecast efficiency of the proposed model remained the same marginal decrease even at higher lead times however an increase in error in the rainfall data affected the model performance which was evident in the analysis done using the synthetically generated rainfall data with the appropriate usage of bias correction methods this limitation can be resolved effectively this proposed model can be best used in small watersheds where the response time of the basin is comparatively short similar to the case study st i where the response time as less than 45 min in such cases even a small amount of consistent rainfall over a period will have a significant impact in terms of flood characteristics on the watershed with the emerging technologies in the field of quantitative precipitation forecast qpf accurate rainfall forecasts are available in varying durations in different parts of the world therefore such data can be used in the proposed model to generate an early forecast and can be used for taking immediate actions to reduce the damage due to such events also the proposed model can be used in ungauged basins where the availability of observed streamflow is scarce in models like swat the parameter transferability from topographically similar watersheds would help to simulate the streamflow with reasonable accuracy humphrey et al 2016 also in this study the models hec hms swat and ann were used to simulate the flow at the basin outlet the concept of an integrated semi distributed hybrid model kashani et al 2016 where the hec hms outputs from the sub basin level integrated with ann model for routing the flow to the outlet can be investigated for future research 5 summary and conclusion flood forecasting has been accepted as a major non structural measure for effective floodplain management ann model has emerged as a promising tool for flood forecasting but the reduced accuracy in forecasting streamflow at higher lead times has hindered its usage in operational flood management programme the two primary reasons which restrict the application of ann models in operational flood forecasting are i requirement of antecedent streamflow data to be given as input to the model which is not available in higher lead times and ii accumulation of error in the simulated output while recursively using the ann model for forecasting the flows at higher lead times to address these issues this paper proposes a hybrid model which combines the strength of a data driven model and a physically based distributed model hec hms swat the conceptualisation of this model was based on the notion that hec hms swat will be able to provide reasonably good simulations which can be used as inputs to the ann model and noise handling capability of the ann model would help improve the forecast at higher lead times in this study ann model was tested with different input architectures using the antecedent rainfall information alone or in combination with observed as well as simulated flows from hec hms swat in an appropriate way to demonstrate the wider applicability of the model two real world catchments were selected the results showed a significant improvement in the prediction accuracy of the ann models when used in combination with the simulated flows from hec hms swat at higher lead times in the first case study st i the proposed model m4t 4 showed an efficiency nse of 0 87 at time step t 4 during the model calibration and 0 91 during the validation similarly in the case study st ii the m4t 4 models performed consistently with only a minor reduction in the performance 0 81 and 0 77 during calibration and validation respectively the study further demonstrated the potential of the model in the real time forecasting scenario where the forecasted rainfall data might contain some level of noise in the data by adding error of certain variance into the observed rainfall data and using the hybrid model to forecast the streamflow the proposed model m4 showed an efficiency nse of 0 95 for a noise variance of 2 and 0 94 for a noise variance of 5 thereby giving a clear indication of the efficiency of the proposed model in handling the noise in the forecasted precipitation the above analysis suggests that the proposed hybrid model is effective in forecasting the streamflow by only using the forecasted rainfall values therefore it is apparent that the hybrid model can be employed to forecast the entire flood event provided that a reasonably accurate rainfall forecast is available it is evident from the above results that the error handling capacity of the proposed models makes it an effective tool for operational flood management

5406,artificial neural network has been acknowledged as a promising tool for accurately forecasting the streamflow however several constraints limit its application in operational hydrology the primary one being the non availability practically not available of observed streamflow to be used as input to the model in addition progressive reduction in forecast accuracy along with an increase in forecast lead time makes the ann model less amenable for operational flood forecasting this study proposes a hybrid model m4 that combines the strength of a physically based distributed hydrological model and a data driven model ann which purges the above concerns the proposed model was tested using two different case studies st i and st ii with respective time steps as fifteen minutes and one day while the first case study demonstrated the application of the model on a real time streamflow forecasting scenario the second one represented a continuous streamflow simulation the performance of the hybrid model was evaluated and the results showed that the proposed hybrid model m4 performed reasonably well at higher lead times nse 0 91 for st i and 0 77 for st ii at time step t 4 the proposed model m4 was further tested for its ability to work with forecasted rainfall synthetically generated using the data of st i and the model performed well with nse of 0 95 though the performance of the models was drawn only up to t 4 it was illustrated that the proposed hybrid model could be used to generate forecasted streamflow hydrograph corresponding to a full flood event well in advance this characteristic of the proposed model enhances its utility in operational flood forecasting keywords flood forecasting hybrid model artificial neural networks higher lead time forecast 1 introduction the occurrence of extreme weather events in several parts of the globe has increased plausibly due to a change in the climate scenario maity and kashid 2011 milly et al 2002 pachauri and meyer 2014 and this necessitates the need for effective flood management one of the essential requirements of any flood management programme is an efficient and accurate event forecasting system however literature shows that as the lead time increases most models exhibit deterioration in forecast accuracy bruen and yang 2005 dawson et al 2006 prakash et al 2014 while artificial neural network ann based models have been found to have better performance as compared to other forecast models badrzadeh et al 2015 campolo et al 1999 chen et al 2015 maier et al 2010 yaseen et al 2019 2017 2015 zhou et al 2019 those too experience deteriorated forecast accuracy at higher lead times therefore anns are presently not considered in operational flood management systems prakash et al 2014 to provide a reasonable streamflow forecast ann models require current and antecedent rainfall information along with antecedent values of streamflow as inputs to the modelling framework rajurkar et al 2004 several agencies across the world such as european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf national centers for environmental prediction ncep japan meteorological agency jma etc cuo et al 2011 provide rainfall forecasts with reasonable accuracy which can be used in the ann models for streamflow forecasting however at higher lead times the non availability of antecedent streamflow values to be used as inputs to the ann makes it challenging to preserve the forecast accuracy of these models though several researchers used the estimated streamflow values from the same ann model as antecedent streamflow for higher lead times in other words recursive input it resulted in accumulation of error in forecasts at higher lead times young et al 2017 though error correction procedures were proposed to overcome this difficulty chen et al 2015 prakash et al 2014 shamseldin and o connor 2001 it did not yield any significant improvement in the forecast accuracy especially at higher lead times the data assimilation methods fahimi et al 2017 madsen and skotner 2005 wmo 1992 also brought only marginal improvement at higher lead time forecasts hybrid models that combined the strengths of two or more modelling approaches were also proposed abrahart et al 2012 khashei and bijari 2012 maier et al 2010 srinivasulu and jain 2009 but no improved performance was achieved at higher lead times through this approach also a comprehensive literature study related to the use of hybrid models in hydrological modelling is given in the supplementary information see appendix a the methods such as the ones discussed above suggested for improving the accuracy of streamflow forecast at higher lead times primarily focused on improving the forecasted values by using different tools and techniques rather than addressing the root cause of the problem the primary reason for a deterioration in performance at higher lead times in anns or hybrid models is that the antecedent streamflow values provided as input to the models mostly the estimated values are not even close to the actual streamflow value antecedent streamflow values are essential in an ann model to identify the general shape of the hydrograph sudheer 2005 a significant error in the input that provides the shape would certainly deteriorate the performance of the model however anns are capable of handling some level of noise in the input information therefore if one can provide antecedent streamflow values with reasonable accuracy one may be able to improve the forecast accuracy at higher lead times a plausible option to provide reasonable estimates of streamflow at antecedent time steps short as well as higher lead time is to use externally simulated streamflow values physically based hydrological models are expected to provide a reasonable simulation of the hydrograph flood event in terms of magnitude and shape as they preserve the physics of the process reasonably well noori and kalin 2016 young et al 2017 though these may not be accurate enough to plan flood mitigation schemes consequently using these simulations as antecedent streamflow information to ann along with the forecasted rainfall may help to improve the streamflow forecast accuracy at higher lead times accordingly this study proposes a novel hybrid modelling approach for efficient streamflow forecasting at higher lead times this hybrid modelling approach combines a physically based hydrological model and ann by employing the external simulations by the hydrological model as input to ann for extending the lead time of streamflow forecasts although researchers have tried to use simulated information from a conceptual model as inputs to ann models their main objective was either to avoid the calibration of conceptual model noori and kalin 2016 or to give it as an additional information to the ann model along with the other observed inputs young et al 2017 to the best of the knowledge of the authors none of the works mentioned above focused on improving the streamflow forecast at higher lead times by considering only the forecasted rainfall information and simulated streamflow information from the conceptual models thus this study is a novel effort in developing a hybrid model to improve the effectiveness of the ann models in forecasting the streamflow at higher lead times two different real world catchments st i and st ii were selected to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model where each one was combined with a different physically based hydrological model while the proposed modelling framework was tested for its applicability in flood forecasting event modelling at a sub hourly time step in st i the framework was also tested for continuous streamflow simulation at daily time step in st ii the formulation of the proposed hybrid modelling approach is discoursed in the following sections 2 methodology the proposed hybrid model considers simulations from a physically based hydrological model that uses forecasted rainfall information along with the forecasted rainfall information itself as inputs to the ann model while any hydrological model can be used for this coupling this study used two semi distributed hydrological models i hydrologic engineering center s hydrologic modelling system hec hms developed by the us army corps of engineers feldman 2000 and ii soil and water assessment tool swat developed by usda and texas a m university arnold et al 1998 the rationale behind the selection of these models is that they are simple and easy to use and produce reasonably good streamflow hydrographs it is to be noted that the accurate simulation of the streamflow hydrograph is not warranted at this stage as these hydrographs as inputs to the ann is expected to help the hybrid model in realising the shape of the hydrograph sudheer 2005 the general form of the proposed hybrid model can be written as eq 1 1 q m t i f q sim t q sim t 1 q sim t j p for t p for t 1 p for t k where q m t i denotes the predicted streamflow using the hybrid model at time step t i q sim represents the simulated flow using hec hms swat at any given time i represents the lead time t is the current time step f is the nonlinear function fitted by ann p for denotes forecasted rainfall values and j and k are the lags considered for streamflow and rainfall respectively it may be noted that eq 1 is a generic form of the proposed model the antecedent values of rainfall as well as of streamflow identified as the input vectors for the model i e the observed rainfall streamflow information if available could be used in the initial lead time forecasts however as the forecast lead time increases the availability of observed information become none and the input to the ann model will contain only forecasted rainfall and simulated streamflow fig 1 illustrates the methodology used in this study to forecast streamflow values the hec hms swat model receives the forecasted rainfall information along with the physical characteristics of the watershed dem land use and soil and generates the hydrograph corresponding to the given rainfall event subsequently this generated hydrograph is provided as an input to the ann model along with the forecasted rainfall information to forecast the streamflow it is to be noted that streamflow forecasting using this hybrid ann can be extended till the time step up to which the rainfall forecast is available the details about the design of the ann model architecture are given in the later sections 2 1 case examples study watersheds and data 2 1 1 piedmont region south carolina usa st i the first watershed considered to illustrate the proposed hybrid model is located in the northern portion of piedmont region fig 2 in the state of south carolina usa spread over an area of 6 85 km2 with a mean elevation of 980 82 m the length of the mainstream in the watershed is 902 76 m historically this area had experienced some severe floods reported in the region including one event that occurred on august 25 1908 when the area received a rainfall amount of 180 34 mm in 24 h over the past few decades this area had undergone few significant events like the one during august 25 27 1995 287 02 mm and another one during september 13 15 2002 180 85 mm therefore an efficient flood forecasting system for the area can be one of the possible solutions to reduce the impact of the event in this area for setting up the hydrological model in this case hec hms digital elevation model dem of 30 m resolution was acquired from the website of south carolina department of natural resources http www dnr sc gov the soil data was obtained from usda soil survey data https www nrcs usda gov and land use data was obtained from multi resolution land characteristics consortium https www mrlc gov the watershed is dominant with residential 35 9 and commercial industrial 36 81 areas therefore any flooding may have a significant impact on human communities in this watershed the dominant soil textural class in the area is sandy loam four years of rainfall data 2013 2016 with 15 min time interval measured at the university ridge rain gauge station located at 34 84 n and 82 40 w see fig 2 was used along with the observed streamflow data of the same duration recorded at a streamflow gauging station located at 34 82 n and 82 41 w see fig 2 from the available data fifteen prominent rainfall events were selected to demonstrate the proposed model of which 12 events were used for calibrating the model and the remaining 3 for validation a summary of the characteristics of the data used in this case study is given in table 1 it is essential to check the statistical similarity between the calibration and validation datasets used for the modelling purpose maier et al 2010 the statistical properties of the selected rainfall and streamflow data in st i are presented in table 2 and they exhibit similar characteristics across calibration and validation datasets 2 1 2 st joseph watershed usa st ii the second watershed considered to validate the proposed model is st joseph watershed situated in the usa covering an area of 2800 km2 fig 3 and spread over three states michigan ohio and indiana the mean elevation of the area is 281 m and the length of the mainstream in the watershed is 100 km the purpose of selecting this study area was to demonstrate the application of the proposed model in streamflow forecasting on a daily time scale for setting up the hydrological model in this case swat dem of 30 m resolution was acquired from national elevation dataset https viewer nationalmap gov the land use and soil data were collected from the multi resolution land characteristics consortium https www mrlc gov and the natural resources conservation service s soil survey geographic ssurgo database https www nrcs usda gov respectively the watershed is dominated by agricultural 59 2 land use followed by pasture 20 7 forest 13 1 wetland 3 9 and urban area 3 1 meteorological information of this watershed was obtained from national climatic data center https www ncdc noaa gov for six stations angola 41 67 n 85 02 n garret 1s 41 33 n 85 12 w hillsdale 41 93 n 84 64 w hicksville 41 28 n 84 75 w montepelier 41 58 n 84 62 w and hudson 3e 41 84 n 84 29 w which are spatially distributed across the watershed see fig 3 the observed streamflow data was obtained for the usgs station id 04180500 located at 41 17 n and 85 07 w see fig 3 out of the total available data of twenty two years 1990 2011 ten years 1993 2002 of data was used for calibration and nine years 2003 2011 for validation the first three years of simulation 1990 1992 was considered as the warm up period for the swat model the characteristics of the data used in this case study are presented in table 1 and the statistical properties of the rainfall and streamflow data used are presented in table 2 both of the physically based hydrological models were set up using the corresponding watershed information the structural details of these physically based hydrological models hec hms and swat are not discussed in this paper as they were not critically involved in the primary objective of the paper readers may refer feldman 2000 and neitsch et al 2011 for more details on these models 2 2 identification of the ann model architecture selection of input variables is the foremost step in the development of an ann model structure galelli et al 2014 in this study the input variables considered were simulated streamflow information from the physically based hydrological model and forecasted rainfall information and the expected output was the streamflow at different lead times to identify the relevant input variables required in the ann framework this study used a correlation based technique where the input vectors are identified based on cross auto and partial auto correlations among the variables srinivasulu and jain 2006 sudheer et al 2002 wu et al 2014 for st i the auto and partial auto correlation of the streamflow data showed a high correlation among streamflow values at lags t 3 t 2 and t 1 with the streamflow value at time step t when tested for correlation cross between antecedent rainfall and observed streamflow data significant correlation 0 50 for antecedent rainfall values were observed at lags t 6 t 5 t 4 t 3 and t 2 with the streamflow value measured at time step t therefore in st i to forecast streamflow at time step t 1 the input vector consisting of p t 5 p t 4 p t 3 p t 2 p t 1 q t 2 q t 1 and q t were used a similar analysis was carried out in st ii where both streamflow and rainfall values at lags t 3 t 2 and t 1 showed a high correlation with streamflow value at time step t it is to be noted that in st ii the rainfall values used were the average areal rainfall calculated based on six rain gauge stations which are spatially distributed across the watershed thus the input vectors considered in st ii to forecast the streamflow at time step t 1 were p t 2 p t 1 p t q t 2 q t 1 and q t it may be noted that the time lags identified in both the case studies were assumed to be invariable at higher lead times 2 2 1 availability of input variables and modelling exercise in this study to forecast the streamflow at time step t 1 both observed rainfall and measured streamflow at time steps before and up to t were considered as available further some of the earlier models employed p t 1 which is the rainfall at time step t 1 as an additional input to the model along with the observed variables assuming that this rainfall information is available as a forecast when used for forecasting the streamflow at higher lead times t 1 t 2 t k the traditional ann models use only this available information as inputs into their modelling framework when a physically based model such as hec hms swat is considered externally the estimated values of discharge for the full event become available for use though with reduced accuracy these estimated discharge information at all the required time steps can be considered as part of the inputs to the ann model hence for making forecasts it can be assumed that the required inputs are available at all the time steps before and including t 1 which could be a mixture of observed and hec hms swat estimated streamflow along with observed forecasted rainfall information it may be noted that in this study to build the ann model for higher lead time forecast forecasted rainfall i e the rainfall values at time steps higher than t is assumed to be available for the examples demonstrated in this study observed rainfall values are used as pseudo forecast values with and without noise a detailed description of the model building is demonstrated using case study st i in the subsequent sections the available information at any given time step t that can be used as input to the ann model is presented in table 3 the ann model structure that forecasts streamflow at lead time t 1 can be written as eq 2 and eq 3 q m t 1 f q obs t q obs t 1 q obs t 2 2 p obs t 1 p obs t 2 p obs t 3 p obs t 4 p obs t 5 q m t 1 f q sim t 1 q obs t q obs t 1 q obs t 2 3 p obs t 1 p obs t 2 p obs t 3 p obs t 4 p obs t 5 where q m t 1 denotes the predicted streamflow using the hybrid model at time step t 1 q sim represents the simulated flow using hec hms swat at any given time and p obs denotes observed rainfall values the major difference between eq 2 and eq 3 is the use of the input variable q sim t 1 in eq 3 which is used as an additional input into the ann model similarly to forecast streamflow at time steps t 2 and t 3 the inputs to the ann will be a combination of the observed streamflow simulated streamflow from hec hms swat accompanied by observed and the forecasted rainfall values see table b 1 the inputs to the ann model for any lead time equal to and greater than time step t 4 will consist of simulated streamflow values from hec hms along with the observed and forecasted rainfall data as given in eq 4 and eq 5 q m t 4 f q sim t 3 q sim t 2 q sim t 1 4 p for t 2 p for t 1 p obs t p obs t 1 p obs t 2 q m t 4 f q sim t 4 q sim t 3 q sim t 2 q sim t 1 5 p for t 2 p for t 1 p obs t p obs t 1 p obs t 2 consequently to forecast the streamflow at any lead time step t k where k 6 the ann model structure adopted in st i can be expressed as eq 6 q m t k f q sim t k q sim t k 1 q sim t k 2 q sim t k 3 6 p for t k 2 p for t k 3 p for t k 4 p for t k 5 p for t k 6 it can be seen from eq 6 that when the lead time increases to t k the model uses only simulated streamflow and forecasted rainfall information as inputs similarly in st ii to forecast the streamflow at time step t 4 the ann model structure considered is given in eq 7 and eq 8 and it uses only simulated forecasted information q m t 4 f q sim t 3 q sim t 2 q sim t 1 7 p for t 3 p for t 2 p for t 1 q m t 4 f q sim t 4 q sim t 3 q sim t 2 q sim t 1 8 p for t 3 p for t 2 p for t 1 consequently the ann model structure to forecast the streamflow for any lead time step t k where k 3 for st ii can be expressed as eq 9 q m t k f q sim t k q sim t k 1 q sim t k 2 q sim t k 3 9 p for t k 1 p for t k 2 p for t k 3 in the case study st i the ann models for lead time step t 1 uses only observed rainfall information however as the forecast lead time increases the rainfall inputs are a mixture of observed and forecasted values of rainfall and from lead time step t 7 onwards the rainfall inputs are only forecasted rainfall note that the longest lead time for forecasts in any basin depends on the availability of forecasted rainfall information generally when the forecast for a rainfall event is fully available this proposed model could be used to forecast the entire streamflow hydrograph resulting from the event this potential of the proposed model is illustrated through the case examples a summary of all the ann model architectures considered in st i and st ii are given in tables b 1 and b 2 respectively the nomenclature used in this paper to represent the ann model structure for different lead time steps follows a general form mi t j where i denotes the model number and j denotes the lead time step the symbol i in the model name takes 4 values from 1 to 4 where each number indicates a specific ann input structure as stated below m1 the model that uses only observed rainfall information as inputs m2 the model that uses observed streamflow information with observed and forecasted rainfall information if available any m3 the model that uses both observed and simulated hec hms swat streamflow along with observed and forecasted rainfall information as inputs m4 the model that uses both observed and simulated hec hms swat streamflow along with observed and forecasted rainfall information as inputs the difference between the models m3 and m4 is that m4 uses simulated hec hms swat streamflow at the forecast time step as an additional input to the model to complete the ann model architecture identification the number of hidden nodes in the ann was selected based on trial and error method maier et al 2010 and both the case studies used a single layer of hidden neurons in the hidden layer in both the models the tangential sigmoid function was used at the hidden as well as the output layer to identify the optimal number of hidden neurons in the hidden layer the performance of the ann was evaluated by varying the number of hidden neurons progressively increasing from 1 to 10 and an architecture that provided the maximum performance was identified as the final one it is to be noted that the number of hidden neurons might vary with lead time step the final architectures selected in st i and st ii are given in appendix b see figs b 1 and b 2 3 model calibration and performance evaluation the ann model architectures were calibrated using amalgam optimiser vrugt and robinson 2007 and split sample validation approach was used to ensure the robustness of the model see appendix d as the first case study st i primarily focused on accurately forecasting the flood events the parameters of this ann model were estimated through a multi objective calibration method where the focus was i to maximise nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and ii to minimise the percentage error in peak flow prediction pdiff the performance indices used for evaluation of the models were root mean square error rmse relative volume error rve and error in peak time prediction etp nayak et al 2005 it is to be noted that the performance index pdiff was computed based on the simulated streamflow value at the time of occurrence of the peak in the observed hydrograph see eq 11 in the second case study st ii where the ann model primarily focused on the continuous simulation of streamflow the model parameters were estimated through single objective calibration by maximising the nse value and the model performance was evaluated using rmse and rve the mathematical descriptions of the performance measures used in this study are given below 10 nse 1 i 1 n q m i q o i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 11 p diff q m p q o p q o p 100 12 rmse 1 n i 1 n q m i q o i 2 13 rve i 1 n q m q 0 i 1 n q o 14 et p t m p t o p where q m and q o represents the simulated and observed streamflow q o is the average of observed streamflow n is the total number of data points t m p and t o p indicates the time taken to reach the peak magnitude of the simulated and observed flow respectively q 0 p is the observed peak flow and q m p is the simulated streamflow at the time of the observed peak flow 4 results and discussion 4 1 performance evaluation of models for st i 4 1 1 validation of the hec hms model given that the use of simulated streamflow from hec hms was not to create an accurate simulation of the event hydrograph the hec hms model was not fully calibrated in this study instead the parameter curve number cn was slightly refined from the default value to get a satisfactory simulation of the streamflow hydrograph the performance measures estimated based on the simulations of the hec hms are presented in table 4 the model simulated the streamflow hydrograph satisfactorily with an nse of 0 67 for both calibration and validation data see table 4 however the simulated hydrographs from hec hms were not able to preserve the accuracy in peak time prediction up to 1200 min in the calibration data and up to 45 min in the validation data it may be noted that the values mentioned above are the estimated average across the events considered for both calibration and validation a similar deterioration in performance was observed while predicting the peak flow magnitude as well see table 4 scatter plots comparing the simulated streamflow from hec hms and the corresponding observed values for the calibration and validation events are presented in fig 4 a and 4b it is evident from fig 4 that the hec hms simulations are reasonably good though the model over predicts the peak flows these simulations were expected to improve the forecast accuracy of ann at higher lead times the simulated hydrograph from hec hms was fed into the hybrid ann model though different ann model architectures were built and evaluated in this study only the results of models m3 and m4 at lead time step t 4 are discussed in this section it is mainly because at this time step the ann models m3 and m4 use only simulated streamflow information from hec hms along with antecedent rainfall values as inputs the performance of other models i e m1 m2 m3 and m4 for lead time steps from t 1 to t 3 are given in the supplementary information see table c 1 4 1 2 performance of hybrid model at lead time step t 4 for st i the ann based hybrid model that forecasts streamflow at lead time step t 4 and above primarily uses simulated values of streamflow variables both the models m3t 4 and m4t 4 exhibited similar performance though m4t 4 performed slightly better than m3t 4 the model performances measured using different performance indices are given in table 5 the nse values corresponding to the performance of m3t 4 were 0 84 and 0 87 respectively during calibration and validation and the corresponding values for m4t 4 were 0 87 and 0 91 respectively the error in the prediction of peak magnitude i e pdiff for the model m3t 4 was ranging between 41 03 to 6 85 during calibration and 30 09 to 1 10 during validation see fig c 1 etp another index which measures the error in predicting the time of occurrence of peak magnitude was falling within the range of 0 to 5 timestep 0 to 75 min for a majority of the events used in the calibration as well as validation of the same model a similar analysis for the model m4t 4 showed the values of pdiff were ranging between 37 48 to 13 60 and 37 73 to 31 61 during calibration and validation respectively whereas etp was ranging from 0 to 5 timesteps 0 to 75 min and 0 to 4 timesteps 0 to 60 min for both calibration and validation respectively other performance measures like rmse and rve were estimated as 0 48 m3 s 0 31 and 0 30 m3 s 0 12 for the model m3t 4 during calibration and validation respectively whereas the performance of the model m4t 4 based on the same indices were reported as 0 44 m3 s 0 27 and 0 24 m3 s 0 12 for the respective periods the scatter plots depicting the performance of m3t 4 and m4t 4 are presented in fig 5 while model m4t 4 maintains a uniform scatter around the ideal line during calibration fig 5c model m3t 4 slightly underpredicted the peak flows during the same period fig 5a a similar overprediction was observed during the validation of m3t 4 fig 5b and a uniform scatter observed for the model m4t 4 fig 5d during the same period while model m4t 4 simulated peak flow more accurately as compared to m3t 4 during calibration it slightly over predicted the peak values compared to the latter during validation it can be further explained with the help of figs 6 and 8 which shows the event hydrographs forecasted by the models m3t 4 and m4t 4 respectively the hydrographs showed a fair agreement with the observed data with a slightly overestimated peak in m4t 4 see fig 8 4 1 3 performance of hybrid model for st i at higher lead times t 4 a specific advantage of the proposed hybrid model is that it can be used for forecasting the streamflow at higher lead times t 4 i e up to the end of the hydrograph event figure 7 illustrates the procedure for employing the hybrid model for forecasting the whole hydrograph as mentioned earlier the hybrid models for lead time equal to or higher than t 4 use rainfall information either observed p obs or forecasted p for as inputs along with the simulated streamflow information from the hec hms m3 m4 note that the forecasted rainfall information can be used instead of observed rainfall if available figure 8 shows the hydrograph forecasted using the model m4t 4 and it can be observed that the hydrograph forecasted by this model preserved the shape of the hydrograph better as compared to the one simulated by m3t 4 see fig 6 this improvement can be attributed to the additional input information the simulated streamflow using hec hms at time step t 4 i e q sim t 4 used in m4t 4 as compared to that used in m3t 4 these results reinforce the suggestions by sudheer 2005 as well as jain et al 2004 that the antecedent discharge information as input to ann models helps them preserve the shape of the hydrograph when the lead time increases to t 5 recent information from the available data observed and forecasted rainfall combined with streamflow from hec hms was used as inputs to the model as these models m3 and m4 uses forecasted information of rainfall it is apparent that these models can be used for forecasting the full event hydrograph much earlier at the time i e at time step t itself in other words when forecasted precipitation information is known the expected flood hydrograph can be effectively generated by the m4t 4 or m3t 4 though with slightly lower accuracy irrespective of the base period of the flood event this characteristic of the hybrid ann model makes it effective for operational flood management 4 2 performance evaluation hybrid ann model for st ii 4 2 1 validation of the swat model as mentioned earlier in the second case study st ii swat model was used to generate daily streamflow information in the st joseph watershed the performance of the swat model is summarized in table 6 it may be noted that in this study the swat model setup used the calibrated swat parameters obtained from femeena et al 2018 the model performed satisfactorily see table 6 with nse of 0 74 and 0 80 during the calibration and validation period respectively figure 9 shows the scatterplots comparing the simulated and observed streamflow values for the calibration and validation data with the calibration and validation data swat in general under predicted the streamflow values as mentioned in section 4 1 1 swat simulations need not give an accurate estimation of the streamflow values instead these values will be used as an input to the ann model to guide the shape of the hydrograph and improve the forecast accuracy of the hybrid ann models 4 2 2 performance of hybrid model for st ii at lead time step t 4 the hybrid model for st ii that uses streamflow values simulated using the swat model and the antecedent rainfall values as inputs was calibrated and validated for different lead time steps the details of the model architectures are given in table b 2 similar to the hybrid model for st i the hybrid model for st ii was able to perform consistently at time step t 4 the performance of both the models at time step t 4 i e m3t 4 and m4t 4 are summarised in table 5 the model m3t 4 reported an efficiency nse of 0 77 during calibration and 0 76 during validation whereas the efficiency of model m4t 4 was reported as 0 81 and 0 77 for the respective periods on evaluating the model performance based on rmse and rve the m3t 4 model reported the respective values as 19 36 m3 s 0 00 during calibration and 20 80 m3 s 0 09 during validation for the same indices m4t 4 model reported 17 36 m3 s 0 01 and 20 20 m3 s 0 12 as values during calibration and validation respectively the performance of both the models was visually compared using scatter plots shown in fig 10 it is evident from the scatter plots that the hybrid model performed better than the swat model with smaller spread across the ideal line during both calibration and validation even though the peak flows were estimated satisfactorily during calibration it was over predicted during validation see fig 10a to 10d on comparing the performance of m3t 4 and m4t 4 the model which uses the most recent streamflow information as an additional input to the ann model performed consistently with the increase in lead time similar to the case of the m4t 4 model in st i these models m4 are expected to show improved performance as long as reasonably accurate rainfall forecast is available 4 3 hybrid model with forecasted precipitation for st i the models discussed earlier considered observed precipitation values as pseudo forecasts however in reality the forecasted precipitation may have a specific anomaly from the observed though ann is capable of handling the noise in the input data the effect of this anomaly on the forecasted flood event needs to be verified consequently an analysis was done by adding some amount of white noise to the observed precipitation so as to consider it as a replacement for the actual forecasted values synthetic forecasted rainfall information and by simulating the flood event for the forecasted precipitation this exercise was undertaken for a selected rainfall event in the validation data set of the first case study wherein normal random noise with 2 variance was added to the rainfall data magnitude of the error ranging between 0 61 mm to 0 96 mm in 15 min time interval to generate a synthetic forecasted rainfall data the event was simulated using the model m4 and the simulated hydrograph is presented in fig 11 along with the observed hydrograph corresponding to the event and the simulated hydrograph using hec hms from fig 11 it can be observed that the proposed hybrid ann model was able to contain the noise generated by the forecasted rainfall as expected the simulated hydrograph from hec hms cannot be directly used for flood management since it failed to capture specific properties of the hydrograph particularly the multiple peaks and the recession limb on evaluating the performance of the model using different indices the m4 model showed an efficiency nse of 0 95 with pdiff and etp as 4 18 and 15 min respectively a similar exercise was carried out by increasing the variance of the noise in the synthetically forecasted rainfall to 5 and the results indicated that the performance of the model m4 was consistent nse 0 94 and pdiff 3 49 the details of the analysis of results are not presented herein for brevity this exercise was further continued by adding noise into the observed rainfall data in a gradual manner up to an error variance of 9 where the model performance was found to result in nse of 0 50 the deterioration in performance could be considered as a limitation of the hybrid model that the model may not work efficiently if the rainfall forecasts have larger error 4 4 the relative importance of inputs in the hybrid model for st i at time step t 4 it is evident from the performance of the proposed hybrid models that in each ann model the performance varies with respect to the adopted input architecture to study the effect of the adopted input architecture in the ann model an analysis was carried out to compute the relative importance of the inputs used in the ann modelling framework the method used for the analysis was adopted from garson 1991 where the researcher made an effort to physically interpret the working of the ann models based on the weights connecting the input hidden layer and hidden output layer of a trained ann model this method is based on the premise that the input information employed for developing the process relationship do contain vital information about the process being modelled this method envisages that the relative importance of each of the input variable can be assessed by interpreting the connection weights of the trained ann model this is achieved by appropriately combining the strength of all the connections of an input variable to the output including those through the hidden nodes a detailed explanation of the methodology is given in jain et al 2008 though this method was considered as a model validation technique in a few studies humphrey et al 2017 this study used it to quantify the relative importance given to the inputs used in the ann model the rationale behind this analysis was to understand the contribution from the hec hms swat simulated streamflow in improving the forecasted streamflow the ann model parameters pertaining to the optimal solution from the model calibration were considered for the specific analysis fig 12 depicts the relative importance given to the individual inputs in models m3t 4 and m4t 4 it is to be noted that while comparing the relative importance of the inputs used in this study the authors have considered the relative importance of the streamflow variables as a significant factor as compared to the rainfall variables due to the high correlation between the streamflow variables it was observed from the figure fig 12 that in m3t 4 amongst all the inputs considered primary importance was given to the recent information used in that particular time step i e q sim t 3 and in m4t 4 it was given to the streamflow variable q sim t 4 resulting in an improvement in the performance of the model it is worth noting that on analysing the ann model parameters for the final 100 solutions of the model calibration the relative importance exhibited by each ann model input followed the same trend as perceived by the optimal solution 4 5 comparison of the performance of hybrid models for st i and st ii with traditional ann models taylor plots that compare the performance of all the models considered at each time step listed in tables b 1 and b 2 are shown in fig 13 a taylor plot illustrates the model performance based on three statistical measures which are correlation coefficient standard deviation and root mean square error rmse from fig 13a it can be observed that all the models considered at time step t 1 were characterised with similar statistical properties irrespective of the inputs considered in the ann model structure as the lead time increases to t 2 fig 13b the performance of the traditional ann model m2t 2 which uses the antecedent streamflow values along with antecedent rainfall values as inputs deteriorated in terms of rmse and correlation coefficient this deteriorated performance is due to the non availability of the observed streamflow values beyond time step t which was required to be given as input to the traditional ann model the lack of recent information dampened the performance of the traditional ann model which was again reflected in the performance of the model m2t 3 fig 13c as the lead time step increases to t 4 fig 13d only two ann models were considered for the forecast i e m3t 4 and m4t 4 where the latter one outperformed the former such a noticeable difference in the performance of the models could be due to the additional input used in the model m4t 4 i e simulated streamflow from hec hms at time step t 4 which is the forecast time step fig 14 compares the performance of all the models considered in both the case studies in terms of nse values in both case studies the m1 model which receives only the rainfall information as input into the ann model showed the lowest performance amongst all the models see fig 14a and 14b such reduced performance was observed by various researchers campolo et al 1999 minns and hall 1996 where rainfall information alone was used as input into the ann model the m2 models which follow the traditional ann model architecture performed better than the hybrid models at time step t 1 however with further increase in lead time the performance of m2 models degraded gradually which can be attributed to the unavailability of the observed streamflow information to be used as input to the ann model the m3 models which follow the input architecture of the traditional ann model but with simulated streamflow from hec hms as input at time steps above t 1 showed a relatively consistent performance at different lead time steps considering the availability of simulated streamflow data at the time of the forecast the hybrid model m4 was proposed and the performance of these models was more consistent throughout the flood event forecast as mentioned earlier m4 models can be employed to generate the entire flood hydrograph event from time t itself with consistent performance the combined modelling effort using a physically based hydrological model and a data driven model showed significant improvement in performance as compared to the traditional method of using ann for streamflow forecasting as hypothesized the simulations from hec hms helped the ann model to capture the flow characteristics of the basin young et al 2017 with the increase in the forecast lead time and in the absence of the observed flow values ann was able to capture the flow characteristics in terms of peak streamflow magnitude and time of occurrence of the peak due to its ability to capture the non linear nature of the process as observed by kashani et al 2014 the forecast efficiency of the proposed model remained the same marginal decrease even at higher lead times however an increase in error in the rainfall data affected the model performance which was evident in the analysis done using the synthetically generated rainfall data with the appropriate usage of bias correction methods this limitation can be resolved effectively this proposed model can be best used in small watersheds where the response time of the basin is comparatively short similar to the case study st i where the response time as less than 45 min in such cases even a small amount of consistent rainfall over a period will have a significant impact in terms of flood characteristics on the watershed with the emerging technologies in the field of quantitative precipitation forecast qpf accurate rainfall forecasts are available in varying durations in different parts of the world therefore such data can be used in the proposed model to generate an early forecast and can be used for taking immediate actions to reduce the damage due to such events also the proposed model can be used in ungauged basins where the availability of observed streamflow is scarce in models like swat the parameter transferability from topographically similar watersheds would help to simulate the streamflow with reasonable accuracy humphrey et al 2016 also in this study the models hec hms swat and ann were used to simulate the flow at the basin outlet the concept of an integrated semi distributed hybrid model kashani et al 2016 where the hec hms outputs from the sub basin level integrated with ann model for routing the flow to the outlet can be investigated for future research 5 summary and conclusion flood forecasting has been accepted as a major non structural measure for effective floodplain management ann model has emerged as a promising tool for flood forecasting but the reduced accuracy in forecasting streamflow at higher lead times has hindered its usage in operational flood management programme the two primary reasons which restrict the application of ann models in operational flood forecasting are i requirement of antecedent streamflow data to be given as input to the model which is not available in higher lead times and ii accumulation of error in the simulated output while recursively using the ann model for forecasting the flows at higher lead times to address these issues this paper proposes a hybrid model which combines the strength of a data driven model and a physically based distributed model hec hms swat the conceptualisation of this model was based on the notion that hec hms swat will be able to provide reasonably good simulations which can be used as inputs to the ann model and noise handling capability of the ann model would help improve the forecast at higher lead times in this study ann model was tested with different input architectures using the antecedent rainfall information alone or in combination with observed as well as simulated flows from hec hms swat in an appropriate way to demonstrate the wider applicability of the model two real world catchments were selected the results showed a significant improvement in the prediction accuracy of the ann models when used in combination with the simulated flows from hec hms swat at higher lead times in the first case study st i the proposed model m4t 4 showed an efficiency nse of 0 87 at time step t 4 during the model calibration and 0 91 during the validation similarly in the case study st ii the m4t 4 models performed consistently with only a minor reduction in the performance 0 81 and 0 77 during calibration and validation respectively the study further demonstrated the potential of the model in the real time forecasting scenario where the forecasted rainfall data might contain some level of noise in the data by adding error of certain variance into the observed rainfall data and using the hybrid model to forecast the streamflow the proposed model m4 showed an efficiency nse of 0 95 for a noise variance of 2 and 0 94 for a noise variance of 5 thereby giving a clear indication of the efficiency of the proposed model in handling the noise in the forecasted precipitation the above analysis suggests that the proposed hybrid model is effective in forecasting the streamflow by only using the forecasted rainfall values therefore it is apparent that the hybrid model can be employed to forecast the entire flood event provided that a reasonably accurate rainfall forecast is available it is evident from the above results that the error handling capacity of the proposed models makes it an effective tool for operational flood management

5407,water in deep aquifers in arid regions is often considered to be fossil when modern recharge rates are negligible relative to the reservoir capacity over the past five decades the nubian sandstone aquifer nsa in the arid region of the sinai peninsula egypt and the negev desert israel has been considered to contain fossil water based on 14c dating which revealed 14c ages of about 30 kyr over most of the aquifer however this relatively homogeneous age distribution contradicts the expected increase in groundwater age in the direction of decreasing piezometric head along the flow trajectories here dating results with the longer lived 81kr radioisotope t1 2 229 11 kyr are presented highlighting a wide age range of 40 kyr to 630 kyr in the confined sections of the aquifer all with very low 14c activity 1 pmc elevated 81kr and 14c activities were only observed within or close to the system s recharge areas these findings support a new perception of groundwater replenishment during different epochs from the early mid pleistocene to the holocene by tracking the downstream age evolution rejuvenation was identified in places where the confinement had been breached at other locations the existence of an older groundwater body contributing to the aquifer was detected by means of strongly depleted 81kr activity high spatial heterogeneity in groundwater ages close to the discharge zone of the system is attributed to pronounced age stratification with depth calculated ages in the more isolated sections of the system were used to assess regional flow velocity hydraulic conductivity and their agreement with present recharge rates we conclude that groundwater ages should be reevaluated with 81kr in regional aquifers where low 14c activities prevail with an effective age range beyond one million years this may enable the reconstruction of recharge history well into the pleistocene and provide crucial information for the management of groundwater resources keywords

and pressure 1 introduction 1 1 groundwater dating groundwater ages are used in hydrology to assess the renewability flow directions and recharge fluxes in aquifers all crucial for the sustainable management of this precious resource bethke and johnson 2008 clark and fritz 1997 very old groundwater sometimes referred to as fossil has been found to be dominant in large aquifer systems worldwide jasechko et al 2017 such as the guarani aquifer in south america aggarwal et al 2014b the great artesian basin in australia collon et al 2000 and the nubian aquifers of north africa petersen et al 2014 sturchio et al 2004 in fact the term fossil is defined differently in different studies in some places this term describes water that exceeds an absolute threshold such as groundwater ages of more than 103 yr margat et al 2006 or water that replenished and saturated the aquifer prior to the holocene jasechko et al 2017 it has been suggested that the latter can be referred to as a non renewable resource along human civilization timescales aggarwal 2013 in other places and most prevalently in semiarid and arid regions this term describes groundwater in which the present recharge is negligible relative to the extent of the groundwater system issar et al 1972 tsur et al 1989 large scale aquifer systems located in semiarid to arid regions are under increasing stress due to their overexploitation richey et al 2015 schulz et al 2017 hence precious information on their age is indispensable for more sustainable management by far the most frequently used dating tool for old groundwater is the radioisotope 14c t1 2 5730 yr with a dating range of up to 40 000 yr aggarwal 2013 this dating method involves several assumptions and limitations including variable initial 14c content in groundwater recharge and water rock interactions that may introduce dead 14c free carbon geyh 2000 2005 plummer and glynn 2013 another uncertainty in the usage of low 14c activities for age determination was recently demonstrated due to possible contamination during sampling and analysis especially for data acquired by using the formerly common direct precipitation method which could introduce a significant amount of atmospheric 14c into the sample aggarwal et al 2014a in a later paper aggarwal et al 2014b suggested 5 percent modern carbon pmc as the lowest measurable value for age estimation therefore the use of low 14c activities may be misleading possibly resulting in underestimation of groundwater age or overestimation of groundwater recharge rates low 14c activities mostly below 5 pmc were observed in pioneering studies conducted in different parts of the nubian sandstone aquifer nsa in the sinai negev basin fig 1 and were interpreted as evidence of groundwater recharge during the wetter glacial period of the late pleistocene gat and issar 1974 issar 1985 issar et al 1972 while these pioneering studies used the formerly common in situ and direct precipitation methods for extraction of the dissolved carbon carmi et al 1971 gleason et al 1969 recent studies have used advanced methods to minimize atmospheric contamination during the carbon precipitation in both the sinai peninsula abouelmagd et al 2014 and in the negev desert vengosh et al 2007 in these recent studies low 14c activities were observed and once again interpreted as evidence of recharge during the last glacial period although even earlier recharge was also suggested the latter was also supported by enzel et al 2008 and burg et al 2013 who proposed that the groundwater age in the negev may be much beyond the scope of 14c dating similar to the findings from the neighboring nsa of the western desert of egypt where 81kr revealed groundwater ages of up to 1 myr sturchio et al 2004 only a few tracers can be used to date groundwater beyond the scope of the 14c method including radioactive 36cl t1 2 301 kyr and radiogenic 4he 36cl is complicated by both variations in the initial 36cl cl ratio and the possible introduction of cl and 36cl in the subsurface bethke and johnson 2008 phillips 2013 whereas 4he requires the quantification of in situ production rates and external fluxes of 4he the latter being difficult to determine torgersen and stute 2013 81kr was long ago identified as an ideal radioactive isotope for dating old subsurface water loosli et al 1970 mazor 1972 thanks to its long half life 81kr can be used over a wide dating range of 40 1300 kyr thus covering a timescale that is far beyond the scope of 14c dating as a noble gas krypton is not involved in any geochemical or hydrochemical reactions furthermore the atmospheric 81kr kr abundance is assumed to be relatively stable over the 81kr dating range buizert et al 2014 purtschert et al 2013 zappala et al 2020 however despite having these ideal tracer qualities measurement of this radioisotope in water long remained out of reach because typical tracer detection methods such as low level proportional decay counting required huge water samples aeschbach hertig 2014 only in the last decade due to technological advances in the atom trap trace analysis atta method has 81kr been transformed into a practical tool jiang et al 2012 lu et al 2014 purtschert et al 2013 yokochi 2016 atta is a laser based atom counting technique for 81kr dating that has been used in several pioneering studies where 81kr ages of 105 106 yr were identified in very large scale aquifers aggarwal et al 2014b gerber et al 2017 matsumoto et al 2018 sturchio et al 2004 atta also allows for simultaneous analysis of the shorter lived isotope 85kr t1 2 10 76 yr which has a dating range similar to 3h tritium t1 2 12 3 yr and serves as an indicator of possible atmospheric contamination of the sample gerber et al 2017 lu et al 2014 in a recent study yokochi et al 2019 we have presented new results of 81kr groundwater dating in the nsa that support the fossil character of this aquifer well beyond timescales of 14c dating and based on a remarkable correlation between 81kr ages and stable isotope ratios point to two major distinct recharge periods in this work we expand upon the 81kr dataset and include additional 14c 18o 2h and salinity data from the entire hydrological basin to reevaluate the flow regime and age evolution along distinct flow trajectories of this regional aquifer based on this extended data set we draw new conclusions on the larger scale flow velocities hydraulic conductivities and long term average recharge rates in particular the 81kr data reveals remarkable age stratification and points to the potential discovery of a formerly unknown brackish water body deep into or beneath the nsa 1 2 hydrogeology of the nsa the sinai peninsula egypt and the negev desert israel are located on the northern margins of the global desert belt and constitute a single hydrological basin for the lower cretaceous nsa this transboundary aquifer a major groundwater reservoir in this arid to hyperarid basin has been assessed to contain more than 2 1011 m3 of fresh to brackish water issar et al 1972 the boundaries of the aquifer fig 1 are mainly dictated by geological structures and faults including the uplifted basement rocks in the south the dead sea transform faults at the margins of the arava valley in the east and the rift faults at the margins of the gulf of suez in the west the northern boundary is defined by a facies change from mainly sandstones to less permeable shales and carbonates accompanied by increased salinity issar 1985 mills and shata 1989 wprp 1998 to simplify the discussions in the present study the sinai negev basin is divided into several different regions which are separated by geological structures including faults the boundary between the southcentral and northern regions in sinai is defined by the minshara shear zone mills and shata 1989 rosenthal et al 2007 the ramon fault defines the boundary between the northern and central negev and the paran fault serves as the boundary between the central and southern negev fig 1 the lower cretaceous rocks of the nsa known locally as the kurnub group overlie a regional angular disconformity and are overlain by a thick carbonate sequence of upper cretaceous rocks kroitoru 1980 the kurnub group clastic sequence marks a prevailing non marine stage prior to a prolonged sea transgression over most of the sinai negev basin bartov 1974 weissbrod 1969 the group consists mainly of nubian sandstone formations with intercalations of clays and silts the percentage of clays within the sequence increases northward and northwestward but sandstones constitute more than 80 of the total thickness of the group under vast parts of the sinai negev basin kroitoru 1980 nativ 1984 the group thickens from 180 m in the south to more than 500 m in northern sinai abd el samie and sadek 2001 and to 400 m in the northeastern negev kroitoru 1980 potential recharge areas of the aquifer include the extended sandstone outcrops surrounding the northern margins of the precambrian massif in southern sinai fig 1a and a few other local restricted outcrops scattered over the anticlines of the northern sinai and the northern negev although some recharge into the aquifer under the present climatic conditions has been reported el rahman 2001 guttman et al 1999 sultan et al 2011 wprp 1998 the current recharge rate has been suggested to be negligible relative to the huge volume of the aquifer gat and issar 1974 kroitoru 1980 and therefore a long mean residence time is expected hydraulic heads suggest confinement at considerable depths under most of the basin issar et al 1972 and flow in a fan like pattern from southcentral sinai toward the main natural outlets fig 1a including western outlets near the gulf of suez northeastern outlets at the southern margins of the dead sea and eastern outlets close to the gulf of aqaba abd el samie and sadek 2001 issar et al 1972 kroitoru 1980 rosenthal et al 2007 in the upstream part of the basin the geological barrier of the themed fault dictates groundwater flow from the southern outcrops northward to the area of nekhel fig 1a where vertical displacement along the fault is minimal abd el samie and sadek 2001 ghoubachi 2017 jica 1999 from this area the flow toward the northeastern outlet of the basin is along two main paths fig 1a derived from the hydrogeological settings an eastern path hereafter defined as flow path 1 heading northeast bypasses the paran fault and the ramon uplifted structure at the eastern margins and continues along the western margins of the arava rift valley toward the salty marshy area south of the dead sea and a western path flow path 2 which bypasses the ramon obstacle from the west then trends northeast between the major anticlines of the northern negev toward the same outlet guttman et al 1999 in the northeastern segment of flow path 2 water heads suggest divergence into two paths fig 1 the southern one continues south of the hazera anticline toward the southern dead sea outlet and the northern one bypasses the hazera anticline from north then trends southeast toward the same outlet fink 1994 all of the aforementioned flow paths drain into the same marshy area south of the dead sea which serves as a main outlet of the hydrogeological system another major flow trajectory is directed toward the outlets at the margins of the gulf of aqaba adar et al 1992 issar et al 1972 but is beyond the scope of the current discussion the antiquity of the nsa in the sinai negev basin has been previously recognized based on low 14c activities see section 1 1 as well as on the anomalous depleted δ18o δ2h values issar et al 1972 computed d excess values dex δ2h 8 δ18o were found to be closer to the global meteoric water line gmwl dex 10 craig 1961 than to the local meteoric water line of the east mediterranean emmwl dex 22 gat and dansgaard 1972 and were used as an indication of recharge under different climatic conditions issar et al 1972 this isotopic evidence together with apparent 14c ages of 13 38 kyr was interpreted as having resulted from a significant recharge during the last glacial period abd el samie and sadek 2001 gat and issar 1974 issar 1985 issar et al 1972 jica 1999 however the seemingly homogeneous age distribution as derived from the 14c activities over most of the sinai negev basin fig 1c is incompatible with the clear hydraulic gradients along the flow paths toward the arava rift valley fig 1 where downstream groundwater aging is expected this was the primary motivation to apply the 81kr dating tool to reexamine the evolution of groundwater age along the flow paths of the aquifer 2 methods groundwater samples were collected from production wells in the negev desert along the lower parts of the flow paths leading toward the dead sea where the oldest water is expected upstream wells are located in the sinai peninsula and were not available for sampling three different sampling campaigns for multiple isotopic and chemical components were conducted in 2014 2015 and 2018 table 1 the stability of ph electrical conductivity temperature and dissolved oxygen were used during the sampling to ensure consistent collection of representative groundwater samples for the analysis of the kr isotopes dissolved gas samples were extracted in situ from typically 200 400 l of water with the use of a field degassing device yokochi 2016 kr was separated from the bulk gas using molecular sieve absorption and gas chromatography purtschert et al 2013 yokochi 2016 producing kr samples of 5 10 μl stp 81kr kr and 85kr kr measurements were performed using an atta 3 instrument where individual atoms of the targeted isotope 81kr and 85kr are selectively captured by resonant laser light into an atom trap and counted by observing the fluorescence of the trapped atoms jiang et al 2012 lu et al 2014 the 81kr kr results are reported as percentages relative to the modern atmospheric 81kr kr abundance pmkr with one sigma measurement uncertainties of 2 4 pmkr or 3 13 finally 81kr ages were simply calculated by inserting the measured 81kr kr ratios into the radioactive decay equation 85kr activities are reported in units of decay per minute per cc stp of krypton gas dpm cc where 85kr analysis yielded a result below the detection limit of the measurement a limit of the activity is quoted in dpm cc at the 90 confidence level the results of the analysis for both kr isotopes are given in table 1 resampling and reanalysis of kr radioisotopes was performed for tamar 9 and tamar 11 wells table 1 these two wells are located only 1 km apart and tap water from different depths in the nsa a 81kr age difference of more than 100 kyr was detected between the two wells in the 2014 campaign a similar difference was found in the 2015 campaign confirming the validity of the results the data from both sampling campaigns are presented in table 1 however due to the similarity and to simplify the discussion we only refer to the samples collected in 2015 sampling for 14c analyses was implemented using two different sampling methods i co2 gas was collected along with all other dissolved gases during the field extraction process and later separated for co2 14c analysis yokochi et al 2018 and ii water samples were collected in 60 ml brown glass bottles for standard 14c analysis of the dissolved inorganic carbon the glass bottles were filled and capped while submerged in a flow cell to avoid any possible atmospheric co2 contamination during sampling a minimal amount 60 µl of hgcl2 solution was injected into the water sample through the cap right after sample collection to prevent any microbial activity that might result in isotope shifts in the carbon pools these water samples were analyzed at the accelerator mass spectrometry ams facility of the gns laboratory in new zealand while the gas samples were analyzed by ams at the university of georgia usa 14c activities and measurement errors are reported in table 1 13c 12c ratios expressed as δ13c with respect to pee dee belemnite pdb are reported with an error of 0 1 and 0 2 for the gas and water samples respectively groundwater was also collected for stable o and h isotopes analyses in water samples were measured with a picarro device at the zuckerberg institute for water research laboratory israel and values are reported as δ18o and δ2h with respect to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow with standard deviations of 0 1 and 0 5 respectively to interpret the 14c results as ages all gathered data including data from previous studies were standardized by uniformly calculating ages with an initial 14c activity of 70 pmc a value based on measured activities in recent groundwater in the region burg et al 2013 eissa et al 2014 vengosh et al 2007 it is important to note that using 14c activity in recent groundwater to estimate the initial activity of groundwater recharged during former epochs introduces some uncertainty since the atmospheric 14c activity varies with time beck et al 2001 stuiver et al 1998 this stands in contrast to the 81kr kr ratio which remains rather constant in the atmosphere over the 81kr dating range even for the post nuclear age purtschert et al 2013 zappala et al 2020 the measured 14c activities were inserted directly into the decay equation without applying any correction model plummer and glynn 2013 hydrological properties of the flow system including flow velocities and hydraulic conductivities were assessed under the assumption of pseudo piston flow in the aquifer groundwater ages are used under this assumption to calculate groundwater flow velocity v by dividing the distance along a specific flow path δx by the age difference δt between two points v δx δt for a known effective porosity n the average groundwater flow velocity is defined by the darcian flux q q v n the hydraulic conductivity k can be calculated k q δϕ for a known hydraulic head gradient δϕ assessments of age distribution along the flow paths were performed using the inverse distance to a power gridding method surfer 11 contour map inverse distance to a power method location and technical data of the sampled wells in the negev and chemical isotopic and hydrological information from previous works in the sinai peninsula are given in the electronic appendix supplementary tables 1 and 2 respectively 3 results activities of the short lived 85kr isotope were very low 1 dpm cc in all of the samples from the negev desert table 1 groundwater 81kr kr ratios in the confined part of the aquifer table 1 ranged from 87 4 pmkr to the lowest ratio of 15 2 pmkr equivalent to ages of 46 16 and 627 47 kyr respectively lower 81kr kr ratios were observed in the southern and central negev versus unexpectedly higher ratios observed in the downstream northeastern negev higher 81kr kr with a near atmospheric ratio of 99 3 pmkr was observed only in a single well makhtesh 5a drilled in the hazera anticline item 5 in fig 1b into a phreatic section of the nsa in the northeastern negev table 1 very low 14c activities 1 pmc were measured for all samples from the confined part of the aquifer in the negev desert table 1 these results were generally lower than or equal to those reported in previous studies summarized in burg et al 2013 in the present study higher 14c activity was only observed in a phreatic zone of the aquifer at the hazera anticline δ13c values of 9 1 to 5 8 were detected in the confined part of the aquifer undifferentiated from those of recent 3h bearing groundwater in other aquifers in the region 12 2 to 6 5 burg et al 2013 dody and weiner 2005 this indicates that rock water exchange with carbonate minerals with 13c 0 and 14c free is not pronounced in this system justifying the use of 14c as a dating tool in the aquifer under the aforementioned conditions the stable isotopic composition of the water in the southern and central negev was found to be depleted in 18o with common δ18o values of 8 similar to values measured in the nsa of southcentral sinai gat and issar 1974 more positive values were observed in the northeastern negev with δ18o ranging from 7 6 to 6 3 in the confined parts and even 6 in the phreatic zone of the aquifer cl contents of 600 800 mg l were observed over most of the negev desert exceptionally higher salinities of 1000 mgcl l were observed in the northernmost part of the basin admon wells and in a single well in the eastern central negev zofar 20 well whereas the lowest salinities were observed as expected within the recharge zone of the aquifer table 1 4 discussion 4 1 age evolution along the flow paths all of the samples from the confined as well as phreatic parts of the nsa in the negev desert revealed insignificant 85kr activity table 1 indicating the absence of a young 0 05 kyr groundwater component in the sampled wells this finding also assures that samples had not been affected by atmospheric air contamination during the dissolved gas extraction and analysis processes the 81kr dating results from the negev desert fig 2 shed new light on the age of this groundwater system which was previously assessed with a seemingly homogeneous distribution of 14c ages the 81kr age in the confined part of the aquifer ranged from 46 kyr in the northeastern negev to 627 kyr in the eastern central negev an increase in 81kr ages downstream in flow path 1 fig 2 was observed between the southwestern most well in the negev shizafon 1 and the paran 20 and 29 wells whereas further north there was no clear trend toward aging along the flow path instead alternation between older and younger 81kr ages was observed high variance in 81kr ages was detected close to the outlets of the aquifer in the northeastern negev where an age difference of more than 200 kyr 127 15 and 328 27 kyr was observed between wells located 10 km apart the very low 14c activities table 1 together with the new 81kr ages fig 2 indicate that groundwater age in the confined part of the aquifer in the negev desert is beyond the scope of the 14c dating range however in addition to this finding the higher 14c activity in the unconfined part of the aquifer makhtesh 5a well 4 8 pmc equivalent to 22 kyr followed by the near atmospheric 81kr kr ratio table 1 confirms a significant contribution of younger recharge to this part of the aquifer this is also supported by the high 14c activity of 67 pmc equivalent to a holocene age of 1 kyr reported for an adjacent abandoned shallower well makhtesh 1 table 1 tapping the nsa vengosh et al 2007 in the sinai peninsula where groundwater currently cannot be sampled for 81kr analyses wells near the southern recharge area including jica 6 and rueikna 3 fig 1c present 14c activities of 5 7 and 46 3 pmc respectively abouelmagd et al 2014 jica 1999 these values are equivalent under the assumptions described in section 2 to groundwater ages of 21 and 3 4 kyr respectively similar to the findings from the northeastern negev this relatively young groundwater evidences recent recharge to the system other reported 14c activities over the sinai peninsula were below 5 pmc fig 1 and thus the use of these values for age interpretation is debatable aggarwal et al 2014a b the possible implications of the latter results from the sinai peninsula are further discussed in section 4 3 to examine the evolution in groundwater ages along the flow paths namely from southcentral sinai to the discharge zone south of the dead sea fig 1 the new 81kr age data in the negev desert were combined with the 14c data from the sinai peninsula fig 3 first we present an age interpolation of former 14c data from the entire basin which depicts the previous misconception of homogeneous 14c ages along flow paths 1 and 2 fig 3a and b next a similar interpolation was performed but this time using only 14c data above 5 pmc from sinai combined with the new 81kr data from the negev desert fig 3c and d this combined 81kr 14c age interpolation was used to track the age evolution along both flow paths with some uncertainty regarding the age distribution in southcentral and northern sinai groundwater flow sections where most of the reported 14c activities are below 5 pmc the spatial age evolution fig 3c down gradient along flow path 1 fig 3e exhibits an age increase fig 3g from a very young 14c age of 3 kyr close to the southern exposures in sinai abouelmagd et al 2014 to the two orders of magnitude older 81kr ages of 376 and 351 kyr in the paran 29 and 20 wells in the negev respectively with the aforementioned uncertainty for the flow section between the southern recharge area in sinai and the southern negev a dramatic increase of 250 kyr in 81kr age is observed downstream of the flow path in the zofar 20 well 627 kyr fig 3g accompanied by a sharp increase in salinity fig 4 but at the same time with low δ18o δ2h values identical to those of other nsa wells in the southern negev fig 5 a further downstream the 81kr age suddenly decreases in the ein yahav 6 well to 118 kyr fig 3g and then gradually yet substantially increases once again toward the discharge area south of the dead sea a younger 81kr age in the tamar 9 well adjacent to the assumed outlets of the nsa deviates from this trend fig 3g indicating additional heterogeneity in the groundwater flow pattern as for flow path 2 a more moderate increase in ages is observed fig 3d versus c from the southern recharge area in sinai toward yorkeam wells in the northeastern negev about 200 km downgradient fig 3f here again uncertainty in age distribution exists for the flow section from southcentral through northern sinai to the negev where low 14c activities 5 pmc are preserved seemingly the 81kr ages in yorkeam 1 and 4 wells 66 and 46 kyr respectively are not inconsistent with the upstream interpreted 14c ages fig 3h although somewhat older 81kr ages 86 113 kyr were observed in adjacent wells yorkeam 2a and makhtesh 3 4a and 11 fig 3h the end of this flow path meets the course of flow path 1 close to the natural outlets south of the dead sea where drastic age elevation to older ages of 250 kyr is observed in the tamar 8 and 11 and zurim 2 wells fig 3h old 81kr ages were also measured in the northernmost wells admon 2a and 5a 222 and 328 kyr respectively fig 2b these two wells are located 1 km apart along the northern branch of flow path 2 which arrives at the same outlets from the north the substantial more than 100 kyr 81kr age difference between these adjacent wells highlights once again the heterogeneity in groundwater ages in this part of the basin as further discussed in section 4 2 4 the lack of a continuous and persistent aging trend in the 81kr ages along the flow paths suggests that hydrological processes other than downstream groundwater aging occur in the aquifer tracking the spatial evolution in 81kr age 14c activities δ18o δ2h and salinity enables the identification of recharge and mixing processes throughout the nsa 4 2 groundwater flow dynamics in the nsa 4 2 1 rejuvenation processes revealed by 81kr ages the dramatic age decrease in the northern section of flow path 1 e g ein yahav 6 well 118 kyr fig 3g as well as the relatively young groundwater in the last segment of flow path 2 yorkeam and makhtesh wells mostly below 100 kyr fig 2a and b respectively imply younger recharge to these parts of the basin most likely this recharge is active over the nubian sandstone outcrops scattered nearby at the northern negev anticlines fig 1 such local recharge is also evidenced by the decrease in salinity along flow path 2 between northern sinai and the northeastern negev fig 4 and the increased δ18o δ2h values accompanying the rejuvenation in 81kr ages in the northeastern negev fig 5a 4 2 2 δ18o δ2h and salinity distribution over the basin the relative abundance of stable 18o and 2h isotopes in isolated groundwater conserves information on the origin of the moisture and the climatic conditions that prevailed during the recharge clark and fritz 1997 gat 1996 the nsa in the sinai negev basin can be spatially divided into four regions each characterized by different δ18o δ2h signals fig 6 the first two located in southcentral sinai and in the southern and central negev are characterized by low δ18o and δ2h values and low dex similar to the gmwl dex 10 the similarity between these clusters implies recharge under similar climatic conditions and probably through the same southern exposures in sinai the isotopic signature of groundwater from the northern regions of sinai and the negev is distinct from those of the southern parts of the basin groundwater in the northeastern negev is characterized by higher δ18o δ2h values accompanied by a higher dex value that is closer to the emmwl value of 22 gat and dansgaard 1972 northern sinai groundwater is also characterized by heavier isotopic composition but is distinct from the northern negev by its lower dex values resembling that of the gmwl fig 6 the difference in the isotopic composition between the southern and northern parts of the aquifer has been related in both sinai and the negev to recharge through the local northern exposures abd el samie and sadek 2001 gat and galai 1982 vengosh et al 2007 two mixing lines are identified in the δ18o δ2h space one is between the oldest groundwater from the southern and central negev grouped around δ18o of 8 4 and young groundwater from the northeastern negev yorkeam 4 with δ18o of 6 5 fig 6 line 1 the second is stretched between southern and northern sinai wells fig 6 line 2 both mixing lines indicate active recharge into the nsa with an increase in δ18o values along the two identified flow paths fig 3i j the combination of 81kr ages in the negev desert with the dex values revealed that recharge took place in the distinct recharge areas under different recharge conditions and during different recharge epochs yokochi et al 2019 elevated salinity as cl was noticed in the most northern wells including admon 2a admon 5a and zurim 2 and in the zofar 20 well located in the central negev fig 4 elsewhere in the confined aquifer within the negev desert cl concentrations were relatively homogeneously distributed between 600 and 800 mg l with no relation to groundwater residence time fig 5b lower cl contents were noted for relatively young groundwater close to the recharge areas of the aquifer including the young groundwater identified in the exposed phreatic part of the aquifer in the makhtesh 1 and makhtesh 5a wells and in wells located near the southern recharge zone in sinai with salinities below 300 mgcl l fig 4 a slight increase in cl content from the recharge area in sinai toward the negev desert along flow path 1 is attributed to mixing of the recharged water with a minute amount of connate unflushed seawater issar 1979 1981 thus such a contribution is expected to have a significant impact on salinity but a negligible effect on 81kr age along flow path 2 salinity increases from southern to northern sinai fig 4 where a higher cl content of 900 2000 mg l was encountered in most wells the abrupt salinization was related to the minshara shear zone fig 1 where dominant faults dissect the continuity of the rocks and two different mechanisms of salinization were suggested i intrusion of saltier water from deeper rock formations and ii unflushed relicts from a pliocene seawater transgression rosenthal et al 2007 further downstream from northern sinai to the northeastern negev the cl content decreases back to 600 800 mg l in the yorkeam wells this serves as additional evidence for local recharge which replenishes the aquifer through nearby outcrops 4 2 3 the oldest brackish groundwater in the basin the exceptionally high 81kr age in the zofar 20 well located in the central negev fig 2a calls for further explanation the 81kr age of 627 kyr is 250 kyr higher than the determined ages in the paran wells 20 km upstream and 500 kyr higher than the 81kr age in the ein yahav 6 well located 15 km downstream figs 2a and 3g the artesian water in this well was already defined as abnormal in the nsa system due to its elevated salinity table 1 fig 4 the ionic ratios and the high 87sr 86sr isotopic ratio obtained by vengosh et al 2007 led these authors to the hypothesis that the elevated salinity is due to the intrusion of local brine into the nsa a possible source for the elevated salinity is the brackish saline water interface that was identified in this area by a time domain electromagnetic method at an estimated depth of 1200 1300 m below surface level kafri et al 2008 about 200 m below the bottom of the well however the measured δ18o δ2h values of zofar 20 8 4 and 56 2 respectively are identical to those of other nsa wells in the southern negev since deep brines in the negev desert typically show highly enriched and even positive 18o signatures nativ et al 1987 the low and typical δ18o value of 8 4 indicates that the brine fraction must be small this small fraction of brine strongly affects the salinity but has only a minor impact on the stable isotopic composition consequently the low 81kr value cannot be attributed to mixing with old brine water moreover if a brine component contributed locally to the nsa only a small fraction of kr would be added due to its low solubility in cl rich water it is thus suggested that the old 81kr age in zofar 20 reflects the ascension of a very old newly discovered brackish water body probably along an adjacent major fault frieslander 2000 which allows the ascent of this ancient water from deeper formations in addition the finding of an ancient water body with δ2h δ18o values identical to those in other nsa wells in the southern and central negev fig 5a serves as evidence of recharge under similar climatic conditions at an even earlier epoch during the mid pleistocene 4 2 4 age stratification in the aquifer a pronounced age difference was observed in four clusters of adjacent wells in the northeastern negev the adjacent wells in each cluster tap groundwater from slightly different levels and probably different water bearing formations of the aquifer fig 7 the age difference may reflect the different streamlines in the aquifer system due to the existence of hydrological separation by clay rich layers in this region as depicted by a representative gamma ray log of the tamar 8 well fig 7 the higher gamma radiation sections the occurrence of layering is clearly exhibited along flow path 2 where the three yorkeam wells located 4 km apart show slightly different 81kr ages that are correlated to the depth of the perforations within the nubian sandstone section fig 7a the same trend is demonstrated along flow path 1 where the age difference of the two adjacent ofarim wells is followed by a δ18o difference in which the deeper well is isotopically more depleted fig 7b the depth age δ18o correlation is even more pronounced in the two clusters located close to the discharge zone of the aquifer the tamar and admon well clusters where an age difference of up to 150 kyr was observed the finding of different ages at different depths has further implications for the hydrological properties of the aquifer the presence of younger groundwater in the upper parts of the aquifer shows that the local recharge has a higher impact on the upper aquifer units with limited if any hydrological impact on the deeper formations that is the heterogeneity in ages at different depths indicates that the nsa in the northeastern negev consists of several distinct sub aquifer units fig 7 since all nsa production wells in this region are perforated at various depths the abstracted water is a proportional mixture based on the different transmissivities of different sub aquifers the calculated 81kr age is therefore the result of this mixture nevertheless the 81kr δ18o correlation fig 5a suggests dominance of two main water types in the nsa of the northeastern negev older δ18o depleted and younger δ18o enriched with a mixing line between these two components yokochi et al 2019 these two components are now also identified as related to depth fig 7 moreover since all of the wells which intrude and tap groundwater from the lower sections of the aquifer are also screened in front of the upper sections it can be concluded that the deeper parts of the aquifer must contain older and isotopically more depleted water than the resulting mixture 4 2 5 age stratification in a current recharge area groundwater layering is also pronounced in the phreatic zone at the hazera anticline fig 1b where the kurnub group and the arad group jurassic sandstone and dolomite rocks are exposed previous lithological studies gave no indication of a hydrological separation between these groups in this region nativ et al 1987 three adjacent wells makhtesh 1 5a and 6 are located over this sandstone exposures and tap groundwater from different depths as illustrated in fig 8 along cross section b b fig 2b an age profile in fig 8 shows sharp aging from very young groundwater exhibiting 14c activity of recent water in the shallowest well vengosh et al 2007 through lower 14c activity accompanied by a high 81kr kr ratio at the intermediate depths to a very old 81kr age of more than 400 kyr in the deepest well these sharp age differences indicate the dominance of lateral flow in the aquifer whereas the vertical groundwater fluxes are limited due to lower vertical conductivities as depicted from the existence of clay rich layers within the nsa stratigraphic sections and demonstrated by the gamma ray log in fig 7 therefore we conclude that in the sinai negev arid zone with limited precipitation local recharge over the sandstone exposures is pronounced only in the upper aquifer sections and is not noticeable in the deeper sections the young groundwater in the phreatic zone of the northeastern negev is distinct in its higher δ18o value circles in fig 5a and is more enriched than those reported for the confined sections of the aquifer a similar pattern of heavier isotopic composition is observed close to the southern recharge zone in sinai where the young groundwater in the rueikna 3 and jica 6 wells is heavier than in other samples in the region fig 6 a similar finding of heavier isotopic composition adjacent to the recharge zones has been recently reported for a regional aquifer in saudi arabia sultan et al 2019 reflecting recent recharge under an extreme arid climate 4 3 interpretation of low 14c activities in view of 81kr ages the extreme gap between the old 81kr ages throughout the negev desert and the younger last glacial period 14c ages reported recently for the sinai peninsula abouelmagd et al 2014 warrants further discussion it can be argued that the low 14c activities that were reported for sinai 1 8 3 9 pmc are at the quantification limits of the 14c dating method and cannot be reliably used for age determination aggarwal et al 2014a to support this argument given that we have no more definite data from sinai we use the low 14c activity 2 0 pmc measured in the eastern most well in sinai kuntella 3 to assess a 14c age of 29 kyr which is more than 250 kyr younger than the 81kr derived age of 295 kyr in the adjacent shizafon 1 well in southern negev since the groundwater flow between these two wells is along a confined isolated segment of only 35 km fig 3g such an age distribution over a short flow distance ostensibly implies a discrepancy between a fast flow rate in the upstream segment i e between the southern recharge area and the kuntella 3 well and a much lower flow rate between kuntella and shizafon 6 9 and 0 1 m yr respectively according to the hydrogeological setup of the isolated flow section in the confined aquifer this huge discrepancy between the calculated flow velocities in the above mentioned flow segments demonstrates the limit of 14c for age interpretation within the nsa nevertheless another possibility that cannot be ruled out is age stratification in the aquifer as already demonstrated for the northeastern negev namely younger water may dominate the upper aquifer sections whereas much older groundwater exists in the deeper sections if such stratification exists the occurrence of two ages by two age indicators with different timescales is anticipated the groundwater age evolution along flow path 2 seems to raise a third explanation only a minor age increase is observed between 14c ages in northern sinai and the relatively young 81kr ages downstream in the northeastern negev fig 3h this is not inconsistent with the two tracer derived ages however the significant decrease in cl content fig 4 and increase in δ18o and δ2h values fig 6 indicate that the younger 81kr ages in the northeastern negev are strongly affected by local groundwater recharge rather than resulting from a modest increase in ages along a confined isolated aquifer to confirm or disprove these alternative explanations the groundwater age in sinai must be reassessed using a long term dating method for the northeastern negev even though age stratification is observed the measured very low 14c activity 1 pmc negates the abstraction of significant amounts of very young groundwater in the confined part of the aquifer if for instance there was a linear mixing between an ancient 14c free water body and a younger water body with an age of 11 kyr 2 half lives or 17 pmc with a mixing ratio of 75 and 25 respectively the expected 14c activity of the mixed water would be 4 pmc this is calculated by using the conservative assumption of 70 pmc for the initial 14c activity of recent groundwater in the basin even though the initial value might have been higher during the late pleistocene and early holocene beck et al 2001 stuiver et al 1998 the similarity in δ13c values of recent groundwater in the region burg et al 2013 dody and weiner 2005 to those obtained for the confined sections of the aquifer indicate minor secondary processes therefore the 14c activities of 1 pmc serve as indicators of the lack of a significant holocene groundwater 12 kyr footprint in the confined parts of the nsa in the negev desert 4 4 regional flow velocities and hydraulic conductivities in ideal confined systems where groundwater flows from a recharge to discharge zone in a deep confined and isolated aquifer and no other processes such as mixing or replenishment occur along the groundwater course average regional flow velocities can be assessed however if additional recharge and mixing of various water bodies take place downstream such an assessment will result in an erroneous flow rate estimation in the arid environment of the nsa 14c data over the confined segments confirm negligible modern recharge moreover the nsa has huge storage and a very long residence time despite the variable climate and recharge rates that prevailed in the region during the pleistocene these characteristics suggest a pseudo steady groundwater flow system rousseau gueutin et al 2013 the calculation of regional flow velocities under pseudo steady state conditions in the sinai negev basin based on water ages can only be applied to isolated sections of the aquifer where mixing of water from different neighboring aquifers with different groundwater ages is unlikely the lack of nearby sandstone exposures along the upper segment of flow path 1 namely between the southern recharge zone in sinai and the southern negev fig 1 suggests that this segment is hydraulically isolated with an age difference of 292 kyr between the very young 14c age in the rueikna 3 well and the much older 81kr age in the shizafon 1 well about 200 km away fig 3g an average flow velocity of 0 73 m yr is calculated for this segment flow velocity of the same order of magnitude 0 29 m yr is obtained further downstream by using only 81kr data on a shorter course of 23 km between the shizafon 1 and paran 29 wells these values are one order of magnitude lower than those calculated by the jica 1999 using 14c ages in the sinai peninsula but are similar to those assessed with a numerical model for the neighboring nubian aquifer in the western desert of egypt patterson et al 2005 the calculated regional flow velocities are used to estimate average hydraulic conductivities in the aquifer for the calculation a hydraulic head gradient of 0 001 is assigned based on a water head difference of roughly 180 m over a distance of 240 km between the reported groundwater head jica 1999 and the measured head in paran 29 well adopting an effective porosity n of 0 1 nativ et al 1987 and assuming pseudo piston flow an average hydraulic conductivity of 0 2 m d is calculated for this flow segment this value is one order of magnitude lower than the average hydraulic conductivity of 1 8 m d obtained by pumping tests in wells tapping the aquifer in southcentral sinai a range of 0 1 4 5 m d abd el samie and sadek 2001 and in the negev desert 0 5 2 0 m d kroitoru 1980 levin 1983 nativ et al 1987 the differences between the age based and pumping test based calculated hydraulic conductivities can be attributed to the fact that the results from the pumping tests represent only the local hydraulic properties surrounding the tested borehole compared to the age based conductivities calculated for the entire regional segment of the confined aquifer in other regional aquifers such differences have been attributed to the layering of groundwater of different ages or to the existence of dead volume in deep water bearing formations where active flow occurs mostly along the upper section streamlines of the aquifer system whereas groundwater in the deeper sections is retained for longer periods mazor and nativ 1992 4 5 groundwater residence time in relation to recharge rates the contemporary and long term average recharge rates to the aquifer can now be examined in light of the 81kr ages where it is assumed that variations in recharge rate occur on shorter timescales than the mean residence time of water in the aquifer quasi steady state contemporary recharge rates based on rainfall runoff evaporation water balance estimations have been assessed at 3 106 m3 yr issar et al 1972 kroitoru 1980 to 33 106 m3 yr dames and moore 1985 wprp 1998 over the sinai peninsula recharge areas in the negev desert additional recharge rates of 0 5 106 m3 yr kroitoru 1980 to 3 4 106 m3 yr guttman et al 1999 were assessed altogether summing to about 3 5 36 106 m3 yr total recharge into the nsa the amount of water stored in the aquifer has been estimated to be on the order of 11 0 1011 m3 under the sinai peninsula nour and yehia 1993 wprp 1998 an additional volume of about 1 3 1011 m3 can be roughly estimated for an area of about 4800 km2 in the negev desert with an average thickness of 270 m kroitoru 1980 and effective porosity of 0 1 nativ et al 1987 this sums to a total volume of 12 3 1011 m3 for the entire nsa an order of magnitude larger than the previous estimation issar et al 1972 assuming pseudo steady state and mass conservation pseudo piston flow a rough estimation of 35 kyr for mean residence time within the nsa is obtained by dividing the storage by the aforementioned higher current recharge rate of 36 106 m3 yr a much longer residence time of 350 kyr is obtained using the lower recharge rate 3 5 106 m3 yr our 81k ages of 300 kyr at the end of the isolated section of the basin namely the southern negev favor the lower value as a more realistic long term average recharge rate for the aquifer 5 summary and conclusions the 81kr ages obtained in this study for groundwater samples from the negev desert change the previous perception of the prevailing hydrological system in the nsa of the sinai negev basin even though 81kr ages could not be acquired for sinai the pronounced age gradient downstream toward the arava rift valley negates both the misconception of a homogeneous age inferred by 14c dating in previous cited studies and the resulting previous determination of a main and single recharge period whereas high 14c activities have been measured for a few wells adjacent to and within the recharge zones of the aquifer very low 14c activities 1 pmc are reported in the present study for the confined parts of the nsa in the negev desert accompanied by as expected elevated 81kr ages variations in 81kr ages along the flow paths prove that the aquifer has been replenished on different occasions since the early mid pleistocene major replenishment events and up to the last few thousand years active recharge has been demonstrated to take place through the nubian sandstone outcrops over the basin the role of the northern negev exposures as intake areas for the system is highlighted by the younger 81kr ages close to these exposures as well as by the variability in salinity and isotopic composition of the water all indicating non isolated segments additional heterogeneity is evidenced in the vertical dimension where the upper parts of the nsa are more affected by recent local recharge thereby demonstrating more active flow and thus younger sections within this aquifer system as a result the measured 81kr kr ratio in the northeastern negev wells which are perforated along long intervals of the nsa represents a mixture of a few sub aquifers in varying proportions in the southern parts of the basin where no such intake area exists the 81kr ages were used to quantify average regional flow velocities and to calculate hydraulic conductivities on the order of 0 1 1 m yr and 10 1 m d respectively as briefly presented in the introduction the term fossil has been used to characterize the nsa for its storage of old groundwater that is mostly isolated from the current recharge the 81kr ages shed new light on the isolation of the system whereas high 14c activities have been measured for a few wells adjacent to and within the recharge zones of the aquifer abouelmagd et al 2014 vengosh et al 2007 very low 14c activities 1 pmc are reported in the present study for the confined parts of the nsa in the negev desert accompanied by elevated 81kr ages along with the unique isotopic composition of the water this evidence indicates that the groundwater is mainly of fossil origin i e recharged under a different climate in the pleistocene however the hydraulic gradients toward the outlets the downstream aging and rejuvenation along the flow paths and the active recharge although negligible all indicate that even though the nsa can be termed fossil in terms of groundwater ages at the same time it is an active and dynamic hydrological system it is definitely neither stagnant nor homogeneous in terms of ages and in some places mainly in the upper layers of the kurnub group prominent active recharge has taken place over the last tens of thousands of years the discovery of a very old groundwater source based on 81kr age in the zofar 20 well indicates the presence of a formerly unknown brackish water body in the deeper parts of the nsa or below it the combination of old 81kr age and low δ18o value in this well confirms that the unique climatic conditions recorded for other 18o depleted samples from the southern and central negev yokochi et al 2019 prevailed at even earlier epochs during the mid pleistocene the discovery of a new brackish artesian aquifer in a desert region is an invaluable treasure brackish groundwater rather than salty water is the preferred feed for inland desalination in a hyperarid basin that strives for fresh water to support desert agriculture even though the limitations of the 14c dating tool for groundwater ages beyond 30 kyr have become more evident in recent studies it is still the only tool used to identify or alternatively refute the existence of a younger groundwater component 103 104 yr this is well illustrated in the current study by the occurrence of elevated 14c activities close to the recharge areas of the aquifer in both the sinai peninsula and the negev desert indicating the presence of young groundwater in contrast very low 14c activities 1 pmc measured in the confined parts of the nsa in the negev show that the signal of young groundwater is limited to areas within or close to the recharge area and decreases downstream due to the huge reservoir of the nsa and the slow flow rate the repeated results of 14c activities below 1 pmc obtained with advanced sampling and analytical methods in the frame of the present study along with the old 81kr ages supporting ages beyond the 14c dating range suggest that the threshold of 5 pmc for the use of 14c as an age tracer aggarwal et al 2014a b might be too conservative this threshold is indeed strongly justified for the earlier time of 14c dating in the context of sampling and analytical methods lowering the minimal significant activity for 14c dating is crucial for stitching together the two radioactive tools into one continuous toolbox in the range of 1 1300 kyr the nsa of the sinai negev basin is located between other immense nubian aquifers including that of the western desert of egypt thorweihe 1990 and the great aquifer system of the arabian plate un escwa and bgr 2013 the nsa is similar to these huge basins in its lithology hydrogeology and prevailing arid climate thus our approach and the demonstrated results can be useful for similar reassessments of the recharge and groundwater flow processes in these extremely important and vast basins furthermore application of similar methodologies and especially the application of 81kr dating together with 14c will provide new insights for the source and origin of the groundwater in these and other regional aquifer systems such information will assist in improving the management and sustainability of these

5407,water in deep aquifers in arid regions is often considered to be fossil when modern recharge rates are negligible relative to the reservoir capacity over the past five decades the nubian sandstone aquifer nsa in the arid region of the sinai peninsula egypt and the negev desert israel has been considered to contain fossil water based on 14c dating which revealed 14c ages of about 30 kyr over most of the aquifer however this relatively homogeneous age distribution contradicts the expected increase in groundwater age in the direction of decreasing piezometric head along the flow trajectories here dating results with the longer lived 81kr radioisotope t1 2 229 11 kyr are presented highlighting a wide age range of 40 kyr to 630 kyr in the confined sections of the aquifer all with very low 14c activity 1 pmc elevated 81kr and 14c activities were only observed within or close to the system s recharge areas these findings support a new perception of groundwater replenishment during different epochs from the early mid pleistocene to the holocene by tracking the downstream age evolution rejuvenation was identified in places where the confinement had been breached at other locations the existence of an older groundwater body contributing to the aquifer was detected by means of strongly depleted 81kr activity high spatial heterogeneity in groundwater ages close to the discharge zone of the system is attributed to pronounced age stratification with depth calculated ages in the more isolated sections of the system were used to assess regional flow velocity hydraulic conductivity and their agreement with present recharge rates we conclude that groundwater ages should be reevaluated with 81kr in regional aquifers where low 14c activities prevail with an effective age range beyond one million years this may enable the reconstruction of recharge history well into the pleistocene and provide crucial information for the management of groundwater resources keywords

management of this precious resource bethke and johnson 2008 clark and fritz 1997 very old groundwater sometimes referred to as fossil has been found to be dominant in large aquifer systems worldwide jasechko et al 2017 such as the guarani aquifer in south america aggarwal et al 2014b the great artesian basin in australia collon et al 2000 and the nubian aquifers of north africa petersen et al 2014 sturchio et al 2004 in fact the term fossil is defined differently in different studies in some places this term describes water that exceeds an absolute threshold such as groundwater ages of more than 103 yr margat et al 2006 or water that replenished and saturated the aquifer prior to the holocene jasechko et al 2017 it has been suggested that the latter can be referred to as a non renewable resource along human civilization timescales aggarwal 2013 in other places and most prevalently in semiarid and arid regions this term describes groundwater in which the present recharge is negligible relative to the extent of the groundwater system issar et al 1972 tsur et al 1989 large scale aquifer systems located in semiarid to arid regions are under increasing stress due to their overexploitation richey et al 2015 schulz et al 2017 hence precious information on their age is indispensable for more sustainable management by far the most frequently used dating tool for old groundwater is the radioisotope 14c t1 2 5730 yr with a dating range of up to 40 000 yr aggarwal 2013 this dating method involves several assumptions and limitations including variable initial 14c content in groundwater recharge and water rock interactions that may introduce dead 14c free carbon geyh 2000 2005 plummer and glynn 2013 another uncertainty in the usage of low 14c activities for age determination was recently demonstrated due to possible contamination during sampling and analysis especially for data acquired by using the formerly common direct precipitation method which could introduce a significant amount of atmospheric 14c into the sample aggarwal et al 2014a in a later paper aggarwal et al 2014b suggested 5 percent modern carbon pmc as the lowest measurable value for age estimation therefore the use of low 14c activities may be misleading possibly resulting in underestimation of groundwater age or overestimation of groundwater recharge rates low 14c activities mostly below 5 pmc were observed in pioneering studies conducted in different parts of the nubian sandstone aquifer nsa in the sinai negev basin fig 1 and were interpreted as evidence of groundwater recharge during the wetter glacial period of the late pleistocene gat and issar 1974 issar 1985 issar et al 1972 while these pioneering studies used the formerly common in situ and direct precipitation methods for extraction of the dissolved carbon carmi et al 1971 gleason et al 1969 recent studies have used advanced methods to minimize atmospheric contamination during the carbon precipitation in both the sinai peninsula abouelmagd et al 2014 and in the negev desert vengosh et al 2007 in these recent studies low 14c activities were observed and once again interpreted as evidence of recharge during the last glacial period although even earlier recharge was also suggested the latter was also supported by enzel et al 2008 and burg et al 2013 who proposed that the groundwater age in the negev may be much beyond the scope of 14c dating similar to the findings from the neighboring nsa of the western desert of egypt where 81kr revealed groundwater ages of up to 1 myr sturchio et al 2004 only a few tracers can be used to date groundwater beyond the scope of the 14c method including radioactive 36cl t1 2 301 kyr and radiogenic 4he 36cl is complicated by both variations in the initial 36cl cl ratio and the possible introduction of cl and 36cl in the subsurface bethke and johnson 2008 phillips 2013 whereas 4he requires the quantification of in situ production rates and external fluxes of 4he the latter being difficult to determine torgersen and stute 2013 81kr was long ago identified as an ideal radioactive isotope for dating old subsurface water loosli et al 1970 mazor 1972 thanks to its long half life 81kr can be used over a wide dating range of 40 1300 kyr thus covering a timescale that is far beyond the scope of 14c dating as a noble gas krypton is not involved in any geochemical or hydrochemical reactions furthermore the atmospheric 81kr kr abundance is assumed to be relatively stable over the 81kr dating range buizert et al 2014 purtschert et al 2013 zappala et al 2020 however despite having these ideal tracer qualities measurement of this radioisotope in water long remained out of reach because typical tracer detection methods such as low level proportional decay counting required huge water samples aeschbach hertig 2014 only in the last decade due to technological advances in the atom trap trace analysis atta method has 81kr been transformed into a practical tool jiang et al 2012 lu et al 2014 purtschert et al 2013 yokochi 2016 atta is a laser based atom counting technique for 81kr dating that has been used in several pioneering studies where 81kr ages of 105 106 yr were identified in very large scale aquifers aggarwal et al 2014b gerber et al 2017 matsumoto et al 2018 sturchio et al 2004 atta also allows for simultaneous analysis of the shorter lived isotope 85kr t1 2 10 76 yr which has a dating range similar to 3h tritium t1 2 12 3 yr and serves as an indicator of possible atmospheric contamination of the sample gerber et al 2017 lu et al 2014 in a recent study yokochi et al 2019 we have presented new results of 81kr groundwater dating in the nsa that support the fossil character of this aquifer well beyond timescales of 14c dating and based on a remarkable correlation between 81kr ages and stable isotope ratios point to two major distinct recharge periods in this work we expand upon the 81kr dataset and include additional 14c 18o 2h and salinity data from the entire hydrological basin to reevaluate the flow regime and age evolution along distinct flow trajectories of this regional aquifer based on this extended data set we draw new conclusions on the larger scale flow velocities hydraulic conductivities and long term average recharge rates in particular the 81kr data reveals remarkable age stratification and points to the potential discovery of a formerly unknown brackish water body deep into or beneath the nsa 1 2 hydrogeology of the nsa the sinai peninsula egypt and the negev desert israel are located on the northern margins of the global desert belt and constitute a single hydrological basin for the lower cretaceous nsa this transboundary aquifer a major groundwater reservoir in this arid to hyperarid basin has been assessed to contain more than 2 1011 m3 of fresh to brackish water issar et al 1972 the boundaries of the aquifer fig 1 are mainly dictated by geological structures and faults including the uplifted basement rocks in the south the dead sea transform faults at the margins of the arava valley in the east and the rift faults at the margins of the gulf of suez in the west the northern boundary is defined by a facies change from mainly sandstones to less permeable shales and carbonates accompanied by increased salinity issar 1985 mills and shata 1989 wprp 1998 to simplify the discussions in the present study the sinai negev basin is divided into several different regions which are separated by geological structures including faults the boundary between the southcentral and northern regions in sinai is defined by the minshara shear zone mills and shata 1989 rosenthal et al 2007 the ramon fault defines the boundary between the northern and central negev and the paran fault serves as the boundary between the central and southern negev fig 1 the lower cretaceous rocks of the nsa known locally as the kurnub group overlie a regional angular disconformity and are overlain by a thick carbonate sequence of upper cretaceous rocks kroitoru 1980 the kurnub group clastic sequence marks a prevailing non marine stage prior to a prolonged sea transgression over most of the sinai negev basin bartov 1974 weissbrod 1969 the group consists mainly of nubian sandstone formations with intercalations of clays and silts the percentage of clays within the sequence increases northward and northwestward but sandstones constitute more than 80 of the total thickness of the group under vast parts of the sinai negev basin kroitoru 1980 nativ 1984 the group thickens from 180 m in the south to more than 500 m in northern sinai abd el samie and sadek 2001 and to 400 m in the northeastern negev kroitoru 1980 potential recharge areas of the aquifer include the extended sandstone outcrops surrounding the northern margins of the precambrian massif in southern sinai fig 1a and a few other local restricted outcrops scattered over the anticlines of the northern sinai and the northern negev although some recharge into the aquifer under the present climatic conditions has been reported el rahman 2001 guttman et al 1999 sultan et al 2011 wprp 1998 the current recharge rate has been suggested to be negligible relative to the huge volume of the aquifer gat and issar 1974 kroitoru 1980 and therefore a long mean residence time is expected hydraulic heads suggest confinement at considerable depths under most of the basin issar et al 1972 and flow in a fan like pattern from southcentral sinai toward the main natural outlets fig 1a including western outlets near the gulf of suez northeastern outlets at the southern margins of the dead sea and eastern outlets close to the gulf of aqaba abd el samie and sadek 2001 issar et al 1972 kroitoru 1980 rosenthal et al 2007 in the upstream part of the basin the geological barrier of the themed fault dictates groundwater flow from the southern outcrops northward to the area of nekhel fig 1a where vertical displacement along the fault is minimal abd el samie and sadek 2001 ghoubachi 2017 jica 1999 from this area the flow toward the northeastern outlet of the basin is along two main paths fig 1a derived from the hydrogeological settings an eastern path hereafter defined as flow path 1 heading northeast bypasses the paran fault and the ramon uplifted structure at the eastern margins and continues along the western margins of the arava rift valley toward the salty marshy area south of the dead sea and a western path flow path 2 which bypasses the ramon obstacle from the west then trends northeast between the major anticlines of the northern negev toward the same outlet guttman et al 1999 in the northeastern segment of flow path 2 water heads suggest divergence into two paths fig 1 the southern one continues south of the hazera anticline toward the southern dead sea outlet and the northern one bypasses the hazera anticline from north then trends southeast toward the same outlet fink 1994 all of the aforementioned flow paths drain into the same marshy area south of the dead sea which serves as a main outlet of the hydrogeological system another major flow trajectory is directed toward the outlets at the margins of the gulf of aqaba adar et al 1992 issar et al 1972 but is beyond the scope of the current discussion the antiquity of the nsa in the sinai negev basin has been previously recognized based on low 14c activities see section 1 1 as well as on the anomalous depleted δ18o δ2h values issar et al 1972 computed d excess values dex δ2h 8 δ18o were found to be closer to the global meteoric water line gmwl dex 10 craig 1961 than to the local meteoric water line of the east mediterranean emmwl dex 22 gat and dansgaard 1972 and were used as an indication of recharge under different climatic conditions issar et al 1972 this isotopic evidence together with apparent 14c ages of 13 38 kyr was interpreted as having resulted from a significant recharge during the last glacial period abd el samie and sadek 2001 gat and issar 1974 issar 1985 issar et al 1972 jica 1999 however the seemingly homogeneous age distribution as derived from the 14c activities over most of the sinai negev basin fig 1c is incompatible with the clear hydraulic gradients along the flow paths toward the arava rift valley fig 1 where downstream groundwater aging is expected this was the primary motivation to apply the 81kr dating tool to reexamine the evolution of groundwater age along the flow paths of the aquifer 2 methods groundwater samples were collected from production wells in the negev desert along the lower parts of the flow paths leading toward the dead sea where the oldest water is expected upstream wells are located in the sinai peninsula and were not available for sampling three different sampling campaigns for multiple isotopic and chemical components were conducted in 2014 2015 and 2018 table 1 the stability of ph electrical conductivity temperature and dissolved oxygen were used during the sampling to ensure consistent collection of representative groundwater samples for the analysis of the kr isotopes dissolved gas samples were extracted in situ from typically 200 400 l of water with the use of a field degassing device yokochi 2016 kr was separated from the bulk gas using molecular sieve absorption and gas chromatography purtschert et al 2013 yokochi 2016 producing kr samples of 5 10 μl stp 81kr kr and 85kr kr measurements were performed using an atta 3 instrument where individual atoms of the targeted isotope 81kr and 85kr are selectively captured by resonant laser light into an atom trap and counted by observing the fluorescence of the trapped atoms jiang et al 2012 lu et al 2014 the 81kr kr results are reported as percentages relative to the modern atmospheric 81kr kr abundance pmkr with one sigma measurement uncertainties of 2 4 pmkr or 3 13 finally 81kr ages were simply calculated by inserting the measured 81kr kr ratios into the radioactive decay equation 85kr activities are reported in units of decay per minute per cc stp of krypton gas dpm cc where 85kr analysis yielded a result below the detection limit of the measurement a limit of the activity is quoted in dpm cc at the 90 confidence level the results of the analysis for both kr isotopes are given in table 1 resampling and reanalysis of kr radioisotopes was performed for tamar 9 and tamar 11 wells table 1 these two wells are located only 1 km apart and tap water from different depths in the nsa a 81kr age difference of more than 100 kyr was detected between the two wells in the 2014 campaign a similar difference was found in the 2015 campaign confirming the validity of the results the data from both sampling campaigns are presented in table 1 however due to the similarity and to simplify the discussion we only refer to the samples collected in 2015 sampling for 14c analyses was implemented using two different sampling methods i co2 gas was collected along with all other dissolved gases during the field extraction process and later separated for co2 14c analysis yokochi et al 2018 and ii water samples were collected in 60 ml brown glass bottles for standard 14c analysis of the dissolved inorganic carbon the glass bottles were filled and capped while submerged in a flow cell to avoid any possible atmospheric co2 contamination during sampling a minimal amount 60 µl of hgcl2 solution was injected into the water sample through the cap right after sample collection to prevent any microbial activity that might result in isotope shifts in the carbon pools these water samples were analyzed at the accelerator mass spectrometry ams facility of the gns laboratory in new zealand while the gas samples were analyzed by ams at the university of georgia usa 14c activities and measurement errors are reported in table 1 13c 12c ratios expressed as δ13c with respect to pee dee belemnite pdb are reported with an error of 0 1 and 0 2 for the gas and water samples respectively groundwater was also collected for stable o and h isotopes analyses in water samples were measured with a picarro device at the zuckerberg institute for water research laboratory israel and values are reported as δ18o and δ2h with respect to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow with standard deviations of 0 1 and 0 5 respectively to interpret the 14c results as ages all gathered data including data from previous studies were standardized by uniformly calculating ages with an initial 14c activity of 70 pmc a value based on measured activities in recent groundwater in the region burg et al 2013 eissa et al 2014 vengosh et al 2007 it is important to note that using 14c activity in recent groundwater to estimate the initial activity of groundwater recharged during former epochs introduces some uncertainty since the atmospheric 14c activity varies with time beck et al 2001 stuiver et al 1998 this stands in contrast to the 81kr kr ratio which remains rather constant in the atmosphere over the 81kr dating range even for the post nuclear age purtschert et al 2013 zappala et al 2020 the measured 14c activities were inserted directly into the decay equation without applying any correction model plummer and glynn 2013 hydrological properties of the flow system including flow velocities and hydraulic conductivities were assessed under the assumption of pseudo piston flow in the aquifer groundwater ages are used under this assumption to calculate groundwater flow velocity v by dividing the distance along a specific flow path δx by the age difference δt between two points v δx δt for a known effective porosity n the average groundwater flow velocity is defined by the darcian flux q q v n the hydraulic conductivity k can be calculated k q δϕ for a known hydraulic head gradient δϕ assessments of age distribution along the flow paths were performed using the inverse distance to a power gridding method surfer 11 contour map inverse distance to a power method location and technical data of the sampled wells in the negev and chemical isotopic and hydrological information from previous works in the sinai peninsula are given in the electronic appendix supplementary tables 1 and 2 respectively 3 results activities of the short lived 85kr isotope were very low 1 dpm cc in all of the samples from the negev desert table 1 groundwater 81kr kr ratios in the confined part of the aquifer table 1 ranged from 87 4 pmkr to the lowest ratio of 15 2 pmkr equivalent to ages of 46 16 and 627 47 kyr respectively lower 81kr kr ratios were observed in the southern and central negev versus unexpectedly higher ratios observed in the downstream northeastern negev higher 81kr kr with a near atmospheric ratio of 99 3 pmkr was observed only in a single well makhtesh 5a drilled in the hazera anticline item 5 in fig 1b into a phreatic section of the nsa in the northeastern negev table 1 very low 14c activities 1 pmc were measured for all samples from the confined part of the aquifer in the negev desert table 1 these results were generally lower than or equal to those reported in previous studies summarized in burg et al 2013 in the present study higher 14c activity was only observed in a phreatic zone of the aquifer at the hazera anticline δ13c values of 9 1 to 5 8 were detected in the confined part of the aquifer undifferentiated from those of recent 3h bearing groundwater in other aquifers in the region 12 2 to 6 5 burg et al 2013 dody and weiner 2005 this indicates that rock water exchange with carbonate minerals with 13c 0 and 14c free is not pronounced in this system justifying the use of 14c as a dating tool in the aquifer under the aforementioned conditions the stable isotopic composition of the water in the southern and central negev was found to be depleted in 18o with common δ18o values of 8 similar to values measured in the nsa of southcentral sinai gat and issar 1974 more positive values were observed in the northeastern negev with δ18o ranging from 7 6 to 6 3 in the confined parts and even 6 in the phreatic zone of the aquifer cl contents of 600 800 mg l were observed over most of the negev desert exceptionally higher salinities of 1000 mgcl l were observed in the northernmost part of the basin admon wells and in a single well in the eastern central negev zofar 20 well whereas the lowest salinities were observed as expected within the recharge zone of the aquifer table 1 4 discussion 4 1 age evolution along the flow paths all of the samples from the confined as well as phreatic parts of the nsa in the negev desert revealed insignificant 85kr activity table 1 indicating the absence of a young 0 05 kyr groundwater component in the sampled wells this finding also assures that samples had not been affected by atmospheric air contamination during the dissolved gas extraction and analysis processes the 81kr dating results from the negev desert fig 2 shed new light on the age of this groundwater system which was previously assessed with a seemingly homogeneous distribution of 14c ages the 81kr age in the confined part of the aquifer ranged from 46 kyr in the northeastern negev to 627 kyr in the eastern central negev an increase in 81kr ages downstream in flow path 1 fig 2 was observed between the southwestern most well in the negev shizafon 1 and the paran 20 and 29 wells whereas further north there was no clear trend toward aging along the flow path instead alternation between older and younger 81kr ages was observed high variance in 81kr ages was detected close to the outlets of the aquifer in the northeastern negev where an age difference of more than 200 kyr 127 15 and 328 27 kyr was observed between wells located 10 km apart the very low 14c activities table 1 together with the new 81kr ages fig 2 indicate that groundwater age in the confined part of the aquifer in the negev desert is beyond the scope of the 14c dating range however in addition to this finding the higher 14c activity in the unconfined part of the aquifer makhtesh 5a well 4 8 pmc equivalent to 22 kyr followed by the near atmospheric 81kr kr ratio table 1 confirms a significant contribution of younger recharge to this part of the aquifer this is also supported by the high 14c activity of 67 pmc equivalent to a holocene age of 1 kyr reported for an adjacent abandoned shallower well makhtesh 1 table 1 tapping the nsa vengosh et al 2007 in the sinai peninsula where groundwater currently cannot be sampled for 81kr analyses wells near the southern recharge area including jica 6 and rueikna 3 fig 1c present 14c activities of 5 7 and 46 3 pmc respectively abouelmagd et al 2014 jica 1999 these values are equivalent under the assumptions described in section 2 to groundwater ages of 21 and 3 4 kyr respectively similar to the findings from the northeastern negev this relatively young groundwater evidences recent recharge to the system other reported 14c activities over the sinai peninsula were below 5 pmc fig 1 and thus the use of these values for age interpretation is debatable aggarwal et al 2014a b the possible implications of the latter results from the sinai peninsula are further discussed in section 4 3 to examine the evolution in groundwater ages along the flow paths namely from southcentral sinai to the discharge zone south of the dead sea fig 1 the new 81kr age data in the negev desert were combined with the 14c data from the sinai peninsula fig 3 first we present an age interpolation of former 14c data from the entire basin which depicts the previous misconception of homogeneous 14c ages along flow paths 1 and 2 fig 3a and b next a similar interpolation was performed but this time using only 14c data above 5 pmc from sinai combined with the new 81kr data from the negev desert fig 3c and d this combined 81kr 14c age interpolation was used to track the age evolution along both flow paths with some uncertainty regarding the age distribution in southcentral and northern sinai groundwater flow sections where most of the reported 14c activities are below 5 pmc the spatial age evolution fig 3c down gradient along flow path 1 fig 3e exhibits an age increase fig 3g from a very young 14c age of 3 kyr close to the southern exposures in sinai abouelmagd et al 2014 to the two orders of magnitude older 81kr ages of 376 and 351 kyr in the paran 29 and 20 wells in the negev respectively with the aforementioned uncertainty for the flow section between the southern recharge area in sinai and the southern negev a dramatic increase of 250 kyr in 81kr age is observed downstream of the flow path in the zofar 20 well 627 kyr fig 3g accompanied by a sharp increase in salinity fig 4 but at the same time with low δ18o δ2h values identical to those of other nsa wells in the southern negev fig 5 a further downstream the 81kr age suddenly decreases in the ein yahav 6 well to 118 kyr fig 3g and then gradually yet substantially increases once again toward the discharge area south of the dead sea a younger 81kr age in the tamar 9 well adjacent to the assumed outlets of the nsa deviates from this trend fig 3g indicating additional heterogeneity in the groundwater flow pattern as for flow path 2 a more moderate increase in ages is observed fig 3d versus c from the southern recharge area in sinai toward yorkeam wells in the northeastern negev about 200 km downgradient fig 3f here again uncertainty in age distribution exists for the flow section from southcentral through northern sinai to the negev where low 14c activities 5 pmc are preserved seemingly the 81kr ages in yorkeam 1 and 4 wells 66 and 46 kyr respectively are not inconsistent with the upstream interpreted 14c ages fig 3h although somewhat older 81kr ages 86 113 kyr were observed in adjacent wells yorkeam 2a and makhtesh 3 4a and 11 fig 3h the end of this flow path meets the course of flow path 1 close to the natural outlets south of the dead sea where drastic age elevation to older ages of 250 kyr is observed in the tamar 8 and 11 and zurim 2 wells fig 3h old 81kr ages were also measured in the northernmost wells admon 2a and 5a 222 and 328 kyr respectively fig 2b these two wells are located 1 km apart along the northern branch of flow path 2 which arrives at the same outlets from the north the substantial more than 100 kyr 81kr age difference between these adjacent wells highlights once again the heterogeneity in groundwater ages in this part of the basin as further discussed in section 4 2 4 the lack of a continuous and persistent aging trend in the 81kr ages along the flow paths suggests that hydrological processes other than downstream groundwater aging occur in the aquifer tracking the spatial evolution in 81kr age 14c activities δ18o δ2h and salinity enables the identification of recharge and mixing processes throughout the nsa 4 2 groundwater flow dynamics in the nsa 4 2 1 rejuvenation processes revealed by 81kr ages the dramatic age decrease in the northern section of flow path 1 e g ein yahav 6 well 118 kyr fig 3g as well as the relatively young groundwater in the last segment of flow path 2 yorkeam and makhtesh wells mostly below 100 kyr fig 2a and b respectively imply younger recharge to these parts of the basin most likely this recharge is active over the nubian sandstone outcrops scattered nearby at the northern negev anticlines fig 1 such local recharge is also evidenced by the decrease in salinity along flow path 2 between northern sinai and the northeastern negev fig 4 and the increased δ18o δ2h values accompanying the rejuvenation in 81kr ages in the northeastern negev fig 5a 4 2 2 δ18o δ2h and salinity distribution over the basin the relative abundance of stable 18o and 2h isotopes in isolated groundwater conserves information on the origin of the moisture and the climatic conditions that prevailed during the recharge clark and fritz 1997 gat 1996 the nsa in the sinai negev basin can be spatially divided into four regions each characterized by different δ18o δ2h signals fig 6 the first two located in southcentral sinai and in the southern and central negev are characterized by low δ18o and δ2h values and low dex similar to the gmwl dex 10 the similarity between these clusters implies recharge under similar climatic conditions and probably through the same southern exposures in sinai the isotopic signature of groundwater from the northern regions of sinai and the negev is distinct from those of the southern parts of the basin groundwater in the northeastern negev is characterized by higher δ18o δ2h values accompanied by a higher dex value that is closer to the emmwl value of 22 gat and dansgaard 1972 northern sinai groundwater is also characterized by heavier isotopic composition but is distinct from the northern negev by its lower dex values resembling that of the gmwl fig 6 the difference in the isotopic composition between the southern and northern parts of the aquifer has been related in both sinai and the negev to recharge through the local northern exposures abd el samie and sadek 2001 gat and galai 1982 vengosh et al 2007 two mixing lines are identified in the δ18o δ2h space one is between the oldest groundwater from the southern and central negev grouped around δ18o of 8 4 and young groundwater from the northeastern negev yorkeam 4 with δ18o of 6 5 fig 6 line 1 the second is stretched between southern and northern sinai wells fig 6 line 2 both mixing lines indicate active recharge into the nsa with an increase in δ18o values along the two identified flow paths fig 3i j the combination of 81kr ages in the negev desert with the dex values revealed that recharge took place in the distinct recharge areas under different recharge conditions and during different recharge epochs yokochi et al 2019 elevated salinity as cl was noticed in the most northern wells including admon 2a admon 5a and zurim 2 and in the zofar 20 well located in the central negev fig 4 elsewhere in the confined aquifer within the negev desert cl concentrations were relatively homogeneously distributed between 600 and 800 mg l with no relation to groundwater residence time fig 5b lower cl contents were noted for relatively young groundwater close to the recharge areas of the aquifer including the young groundwater identified in the exposed phreatic part of the aquifer in the makhtesh 1 and makhtesh 5a wells and in wells located near the southern recharge zone in sinai with salinities below 300 mgcl l fig 4 a slight increase in cl content from the recharge area in sinai toward the negev desert along flow path 1 is attributed to mixing of the recharged water with a minute amount of connate unflushed seawater issar 1979 1981 thus such a contribution is expected to have a significant impact on salinity but a negligible effect on 81kr age along flow path 2 salinity increases from southern to northern sinai fig 4 where a higher cl content of 900 2000 mg l was encountered in most wells the abrupt salinization was related to the minshara shear zone fig 1 where dominant faults dissect the continuity of the rocks and two different mechanisms of salinization were suggested i intrusion of saltier water from deeper rock formations and ii unflushed relicts from a pliocene seawater transgression rosenthal et al 2007 further downstream from northern sinai to the northeastern negev the cl content decreases back to 600 800 mg l in the yorkeam wells this serves as additional evidence for local recharge which replenishes the aquifer through nearby outcrops 4 2 3 the oldest brackish groundwater in the basin the exceptionally high 81kr age in the zofar 20 well located in the central negev fig 2a calls for further explanation the 81kr age of 627 kyr is 250 kyr higher than the determined ages in the paran wells 20 km upstream and 500 kyr higher than the 81kr age in the ein yahav 6 well located 15 km downstream figs 2a and 3g the artesian water in this well was already defined as abnormal in the nsa system due to its elevated salinity table 1 fig 4 the ionic ratios and the high 87sr 86sr isotopic ratio obtained by vengosh et al 2007 led these authors to the hypothesis that the elevated salinity is due to the intrusion of local brine into the nsa a possible source for the elevated salinity is the brackish saline water interface that was identified in this area by a time domain electromagnetic method at an estimated depth of 1200 1300 m below surface level kafri et al 2008 about 200 m below the bottom of the well however the measured δ18o δ2h values of zofar 20 8 4 and 56 2 respectively are identical to those of other nsa wells in the southern negev since deep brines in the negev desert typically show highly enriched and even positive 18o signatures nativ et al 1987 the low and typical δ18o value of 8 4 indicates that the brine fraction must be small this small fraction of brine strongly affects the salinity but has only a minor impact on the stable isotopic composition consequently the low 81kr value cannot be attributed to mixing with old brine water moreover if a brine component contributed locally to the nsa only a small fraction of kr would be added due to its low solubility in cl rich water it is thus suggested that the old 81kr age in zofar 20 reflects the ascension of a very old newly discovered brackish water body probably along an adjacent major fault frieslander 2000 which allows the ascent of this ancient water from deeper formations in addition the finding of an ancient water body with δ2h δ18o values identical to those in other nsa wells in the southern and central negev fig 5a serves as evidence of recharge under similar climatic conditions at an even earlier epoch during the mid pleistocene 4 2 4 age stratification in the aquifer a pronounced age difference was observed in four clusters of adjacent wells in the northeastern negev the adjacent wells in each cluster tap groundwater from slightly different levels and probably different water bearing formations of the aquifer fig 7 the age difference may reflect the different streamlines in the aquifer system due to the existence of hydrological separation by clay rich layers in this region as depicted by a representative gamma ray log of the tamar 8 well fig 7 the higher gamma radiation sections the occurrence of layering is clearly exhibited along flow path 2 where the three yorkeam wells located 4 km apart show slightly different 81kr ages that are correlated to the depth of the perforations within the nubian sandstone section fig 7a the same trend is demonstrated along flow path 1 where the age difference of the two adjacent ofarim wells is followed by a δ18o difference in which the deeper well is isotopically more depleted fig 7b the depth age δ18o correlation is even more pronounced in the two clusters located close to the discharge zone of the aquifer the tamar and admon well clusters where an age difference of up to 150 kyr was observed the finding of different ages at different depths has further implications for the hydrological properties of the aquifer the presence of younger groundwater in the upper parts of the aquifer shows that the local recharge has a higher impact on the upper aquifer units with limited if any hydrological impact on the deeper formations that is the heterogeneity in ages at different depths indicates that the nsa in the northeastern negev consists of several distinct sub aquifer units fig 7 since all nsa production wells in this region are perforated at various depths the abstracted water is a proportional mixture based on the different transmissivities of different sub aquifers the calculated 81kr age is therefore the result of this mixture nevertheless the 81kr δ18o correlation fig 5a suggests dominance of two main water types in the nsa of the northeastern negev older δ18o depleted and younger δ18o enriched with a mixing line between these two components yokochi et al 2019 these two components are now also identified as related to depth fig 7 moreover since all of the wells which intrude and tap groundwater from the lower sections of the aquifer are also screened in front of the upper sections it can be concluded that the deeper parts of the aquifer must contain older and isotopically more depleted water than the resulting mixture 4 2 5 age stratification in a current recharge area groundwater layering is also pronounced in the phreatic zone at the hazera anticline fig 1b where the kurnub group and the arad group jurassic sandstone and dolomite rocks are exposed previous lithological studies gave no indication of a hydrological separation between these groups in this region nativ et al 1987 three adjacent wells makhtesh 1 5a and 6 are located over this sandstone exposures and tap groundwater from different depths as illustrated in fig 8 along cross section b b fig 2b an age profile in fig 8 shows sharp aging from very young groundwater exhibiting 14c activity of recent water in the shallowest well vengosh et al 2007 through lower 14c activity accompanied by a high 81kr kr ratio at the intermediate depths to a very old 81kr age of more than 400 kyr in the deepest well these sharp age differences indicate the dominance of lateral flow in the aquifer whereas the vertical groundwater fluxes are limited due to lower vertical conductivities as depicted from the existence of clay rich layers within the nsa stratigraphic sections and demonstrated by the gamma ray log in fig 7 therefore we conclude that in the sinai negev arid zone with limited precipitation local recharge over the sandstone exposures is pronounced only in the upper aquifer sections and is not noticeable in the deeper sections the young groundwater in the phreatic zone of the northeastern negev is distinct in its higher δ18o value circles in fig 5a and is more enriched than those reported for the confined sections of the aquifer a similar pattern of heavier isotopic composition is observed close to the southern recharge zone in sinai where the young groundwater in the rueikna 3 and jica 6 wells is heavier than in other samples in the region fig 6 a similar finding of heavier isotopic composition adjacent to the recharge zones has been recently reported for a regional aquifer in saudi arabia sultan et al 2019 reflecting recent recharge under an extreme arid climate 4 3 interpretation of low 14c activities in view of 81kr ages the extreme gap between the old 81kr ages throughout the negev desert and the younger last glacial period 14c ages reported recently for the sinai peninsula abouelmagd et al 2014 warrants further discussion it can be argued that the low 14c activities that were reported for sinai 1 8 3 9 pmc are at the quantification limits of the 14c dating method and cannot be reliably used for age determination aggarwal et al 2014a to support this argument given that we have no more definite data from sinai we use the low 14c activity 2 0 pmc measured in the eastern most well in sinai kuntella 3 to assess a 14c age of 29 kyr which is more than 250 kyr younger than the 81kr derived age of 295 kyr in the adjacent shizafon 1 well in southern negev since the groundwater flow between these two wells is along a confined isolated segment of only 35 km fig 3g such an age distribution over a short flow distance ostensibly implies a discrepancy between a fast flow rate in the upstream segment i e between the southern recharge area and the kuntella 3 well and a much lower flow rate between kuntella and shizafon 6 9 and 0 1 m yr respectively according to the hydrogeological setup of the isolated flow section in the confined aquifer this huge discrepancy between the calculated flow velocities in the above mentioned flow segments demonstrates the limit of 14c for age interpretation within the nsa nevertheless another possibility that cannot be ruled out is age stratification in the aquifer as already demonstrated for the northeastern negev namely younger water may dominate the upper aquifer sections whereas much older groundwater exists in the deeper sections if such stratification exists the occurrence of two ages by two age indicators with different timescales is anticipated the groundwater age evolution along flow path 2 seems to raise a third explanation only a minor age increase is observed between 14c ages in northern sinai and the relatively young 81kr ages downstream in the northeastern negev fig 3h this is not inconsistent with the two tracer derived ages however the significant decrease in cl content fig 4 and increase in δ18o and δ2h values fig 6 indicate that the younger 81kr ages in the northeastern negev are strongly affected by local groundwater recharge rather than resulting from a modest increase in ages along a confined isolated aquifer to confirm or disprove these alternative explanations the groundwater age in sinai must be reassessed using a long term dating method for the northeastern negev even though age stratification is observed the measured very low 14c activity 1 pmc negates the abstraction of significant amounts of very young groundwater in the confined part of the aquifer if for instance there was a linear mixing between an ancient 14c free water body and a younger water body with an age of 11 kyr 2 half lives or 17 pmc with a mixing ratio of 75 and 25 respectively the expected 14c activity of the mixed water would be 4 pmc this is calculated by using the conservative assumption of 70 pmc for the initial 14c activity of recent groundwater in the basin even though the initial value might have been higher during the late pleistocene and early holocene beck et al 2001 stuiver et al 1998 the similarity in δ13c values of recent groundwater in the region burg et al 2013 dody and weiner 2005 to those obtained for the confined sections of the aquifer indicate minor secondary processes therefore the 14c activities of 1 pmc serve as indicators of the lack of a significant holocene groundwater 12 kyr footprint in the confined parts of the nsa in the negev desert 4 4 regional flow velocities and hydraulic conductivities in ideal confined systems where groundwater flows from a recharge to discharge zone in a deep confined and isolated aquifer and no other processes such as mixing or replenishment occur along the groundwater course average regional flow velocities can be assessed however if additional recharge and mixing of various water bodies take place downstream such an assessment will result in an erroneous flow rate estimation in the arid environment of the nsa 14c data over the confined segments confirm negligible modern recharge moreover the nsa has huge storage and a very long residence time despite the variable climate and recharge rates that prevailed in the region during the pleistocene these characteristics suggest a pseudo steady groundwater flow system rousseau gueutin et al 2013 the calculation of regional flow velocities under pseudo steady state conditions in the sinai negev basin based on water ages can only be applied to isolated sections of the aquifer where mixing of water from different neighboring aquifers with different groundwater ages is unlikely the lack of nearby sandstone exposures along the upper segment of flow path 1 namely between the southern recharge zone in sinai and the southern negev fig 1 suggests that this segment is hydraulically isolated with an age difference of 292 kyr between the very young 14c age in the rueikna 3 well and the much older 81kr age in the shizafon 1 well about 200 km away fig 3g an average flow velocity of 0 73 m yr is calculated for this segment flow velocity of the same order of magnitude 0 29 m yr is obtained further downstream by using only 81kr data on a shorter course of 23 km between the shizafon 1 and paran 29 wells these values are one order of magnitude lower than those calculated by the jica 1999 using 14c ages in the sinai peninsula but are similar to those assessed with a numerical model for the neighboring nubian aquifer in the western desert of egypt patterson et al 2005 the calculated regional flow velocities are used to estimate average hydraulic conductivities in the aquifer for the calculation a hydraulic head gradient of 0 001 is assigned based on a water head difference of roughly 180 m over a distance of 240 km between the reported groundwater head jica 1999 and the measured head in paran 29 well adopting an effective porosity n of 0 1 nativ et al 1987 and assuming pseudo piston flow an average hydraulic conductivity of 0 2 m d is calculated for this flow segment this value is one order of magnitude lower than the average hydraulic conductivity of 1 8 m d obtained by pumping tests in wells tapping the aquifer in southcentral sinai a range of 0 1 4 5 m d abd el samie and sadek 2001 and in the negev desert 0 5 2 0 m d kroitoru 1980 levin 1983 nativ et al 1987 the differences between the age based and pumping test based calculated hydraulic conductivities can be attributed to the fact that the results from the pumping tests represent only the local hydraulic properties surrounding the tested borehole compared to the age based conductivities calculated for the entire regional segment of the confined aquifer in other regional aquifers such differences have been attributed to the layering of groundwater of different ages or to the existence of dead volume in deep water bearing formations where active flow occurs mostly along the upper section streamlines of the aquifer system whereas groundwater in the deeper sections is retained for longer periods mazor and nativ 1992 4 5 groundwater residence time in relation to recharge rates the contemporary and long term average recharge rates to the aquifer can now be examined in light of the 81kr ages where it is assumed that variations in recharge rate occur on shorter timescales than the mean residence time of water in the aquifer quasi steady state contemporary recharge rates based on rainfall runoff evaporation water balance estimations have been assessed at 3 106 m3 yr issar et al 1972 kroitoru 1980 to 33 106 m3 yr dames and moore 1985 wprp 1998 over the sinai peninsula recharge areas in the negev desert additional recharge rates of 0 5 106 m3 yr kroitoru 1980 to 3 4 106 m3 yr guttman et al 1999 were assessed altogether summing to about 3 5 36 106 m3 yr total recharge into the nsa the amount of water stored in the aquifer has been estimated to be on the order of 11 0 1011 m3 under the sinai peninsula nour and yehia 1993 wprp 1998 an additional volume of about 1 3 1011 m3 can be roughly estimated for an area of about 4800 km2 in the negev desert with an average thickness of 270 m kroitoru 1980 and effective porosity of 0 1 nativ et al 1987 this sums to a total volume of 12 3 1011 m3 for the entire nsa an order of magnitude larger than the previous estimation issar et al 1972 assuming pseudo steady state and mass conservation pseudo piston flow a rough estimation of 35 kyr for mean residence time within the nsa is obtained by dividing the storage by the aforementioned higher current recharge rate of 36 106 m3 yr a much longer residence time of 350 kyr is obtained using the lower recharge rate 3 5 106 m3 yr our 81k ages of 300 kyr at the end of the isolated section of the basin namely the southern negev favor the lower value as a more realistic long term average recharge rate for the aquifer 5 summary and conclusions the 81kr ages obtained in this study for groundwater samples from the negev desert change the previous perception of the prevailing hydrological system in the nsa of the sinai negev basin even though 81kr ages could not be acquired for sinai the pronounced age gradient downstream toward the arava rift valley negates both the misconception of a homogeneous age inferred by 14c dating in previous cited studies and the resulting previous determination of a main and single recharge period whereas high 14c activities have been measured for a few wells adjacent to and within the recharge zones of the aquifer very low 14c activities 1 pmc are reported in the present study for the confined parts of the nsa in the negev desert accompanied by as expected elevated 81kr ages variations in 81kr ages along the flow paths prove that the aquifer has been replenished on different occasions since the early mid pleistocene major replenishment events and up to the last few thousand years active recharge has been demonstrated to take place through the nubian sandstone outcrops over the basin the role of the northern negev exposures as intake areas for the system is highlighted by the younger 81kr ages close to these exposures as well as by the variability in salinity and isotopic composition of the water all indicating non isolated segments additional heterogeneity is evidenced in the vertical dimension where the upper parts of the nsa are more affected by recent local recharge thereby demonstrating more active flow and thus younger sections within this aquifer system as a result the measured 81kr kr ratio in the northeastern negev wells which are perforated along long intervals of the nsa represents a mixture of a few sub aquifers in varying proportions in the southern parts of the basin where no such intake area exists the 81kr ages were used to quantify average regional flow velocities and to calculate hydraulic conductivities on the order of 0 1 1 m yr and 10 1 m d respectively as briefly presented in the introduction the term fossil has been used to characterize the nsa for its storage of old groundwater that is mostly isolated from the current recharge the 81kr ages shed new light on the isolation of the system whereas high 14c activities have been measured for a few wells adjacent to and within the recharge zones of the aquifer abouelmagd et al 2014 vengosh et al 2007 very low 14c activities 1 pmc are reported in the present study for the confined parts of the nsa in the negev desert accompanied by elevated 81kr ages along with the unique isotopic composition of the water this evidence indicates that the groundwater is mainly of fossil origin i e recharged under a different climate in the pleistocene however the hydraulic gradients toward the outlets the downstream aging and rejuvenation along the flow paths and the active recharge although negligible all indicate that even though the nsa can be termed fossil in terms of groundwater ages at the same time it is an active and dynamic hydrological system it is definitely neither stagnant nor homogeneous in terms of ages and in some places mainly in the upper layers of the kurnub group prominent active recharge has taken place over the last tens of thousands of years the discovery of a very old groundwater source based on 81kr age in the zofar 20 well indicates the presence of a formerly unknown brackish water body in the deeper parts of the nsa or below it the combination of old 81kr age and low δ18o value in this well confirms that the unique climatic conditions recorded for other 18o depleted samples from the southern and central negev yokochi et al 2019 prevailed at even earlier epochs during the mid pleistocene the discovery of a new brackish artesian aquifer in a desert region is an invaluable treasure brackish groundwater rather than salty water is the preferred feed for inland desalination in a hyperarid basin that strives for fresh water to support desert agriculture even though the limitations of the 14c dating tool for groundwater ages beyond 30 kyr have become more evident in recent studies it is still the only tool used to identify or alternatively refute the existence of a younger groundwater component 103 104 yr this is well illustrated in the current study by the occurrence of elevated 14c activities close to the recharge areas of the aquifer in both the sinai peninsula and the negev desert indicating the presence of young groundwater in contrast very low 14c activities 1 pmc measured in the confined parts of the nsa in the negev show that the signal of young groundwater is limited to areas within or close to the recharge area and decreases downstream due to the huge reservoir of the nsa and the slow flow rate the repeated results of 14c activities below 1 pmc obtained with advanced sampling and analytical methods in the frame of the present study along with the old 81kr ages supporting ages beyond the 14c dating range suggest that the threshold of 5 pmc for the use of 14c as an age tracer aggarwal et al 2014a b might be too conservative this threshold is indeed strongly justified for the earlier time of 14c dating in the context of sampling and analytical methods lowering the minimal significant activity for 14c dating is crucial for stitching together the two radioactive tools into one continuous toolbox in the range of 1 1300 kyr the nsa of the sinai negev basin is located between other immense nubian aquifers including that of the western desert of egypt thorweihe 1990 and the great aquifer system of the arabian plate un escwa and bgr 2013 the nsa is similar to these huge basins in its lithology hydrogeology and prevailing arid climate thus our approach and the demonstrated results can be useful for similar reassessments of the recharge and groundwater flow processes in these extremely important and vast basins furthermore application of similar methodologies and especially the application of 81kr dating together with 14c will provide new insights for the source and origin of the groundwater in these and other regional aquifer systems such information will assist in improving the management and sustainability of these

the aquatic ecosystem species any impairments in water quality such as elevated water temperature and low do concentrations can limit the survival of aquatic ecosystems and its species such as walleye

stations spring and summer reduced far below the thresholds for ecosystems survival in concurrent reduction with do the fc concentration considerably varied in the different monitoring stations of arb these results highlight that do doc and fc variability in the arb may drive changes in water quality and ecosystem services that have to be understood on the specific research scale for designing adaptive management scenarios this study reveals that the new swat model can be applied to other similar regions of the worlds keywords ecosystem water quality swat model dissolved oxygen dissolved organic carbon fecal coliforms 1 introduction the health of river systems is of critical importance for sustainable economic development and biodiversity however human activities global population growth and climate change can change river systems leading to degradation of water quality and aquatic habitat and loss of biodiversity dudgeon 2014 reid et al 2019 therefore sustainable management of river systems requires a fundamental understanding of how ecosystem processes and functions respond to change of natural and anthropogenic drivers water quality parameters like dissolved oxygen do fecal coliform fc sediment concentration and dissolved organic carbon doc are significant indicators in the aquatic species distribution and health zhu et al 2018 and play a significant role in regulating water resources for human use and aquatic habitat health caldwell et al 2015 several studies have showed that deterioration of water quality resulted in degradation of ecology dudgeon 2014 reid et al 2019 fish diseases as well as mortality has been observed on various occasions in the water bodies zhang et al 2012 therefore quantifying water quality i e do doc and fc variations in time and space and its impacts on aquatic ecosystem are an important to know about human induced and other sources of pollutants to the aquatic system bouraoui and grizzetti 2014 zhang 2018 in the surface water systems doc of terrestrial carbon storage undergoes reaction and transport processes in the aquatic environment cole et al 2007 monteith et al 2007 and whitehead et al 2009 reported that doc concentrations in surface waters across north america and europe could increase more than 50 of the total doc transported from land surface to the water bodies even though doc is not a toxic contaminant it could hinder the surface water quality by helping the transport of various contaminants and therefore form toxic compounds for instance the concentration of doc directly affects the toxic heavy metals and other organic partitioning processes allison and allison 2005 du et al 2019a melaku and wang 2019 heavy loading of organic matter that transported into water bodies is responsible for the reduction of do in the aquatic bodies moreover the transport of wastewater into the lagoons resulted in huge environmental problems for both drinking water quality and aquatic ecosystem de godos et al 2010 high concentrations of doc could hinder surface water availability by acting as decontamination of by products precursors it could combine with the chlorine as a disinfectant in water supply systems and produce probable carcinogenic compounds chowdhury et al 2009 it has been found by pandey et al 2013 and pandey et al 2014 that point and nonpoint sources particularly animal waste could lead to an abrupt increase in concentration of fecal coliforms fc and high water contamination in squaw creek watershed an integrated modelling approach considering different sources of pollution and their effects on water bodies is needed for the best management of river basins since the individual components of various wastewater systems could not represent performance of the whole system reußner et al 2008 freni et al 2011 assuming the significance of do doc and fc in water bodies for fresh water health it is critical to recognize how different natural and human drivers such as soil and water conservation landuse climate changes and restoration of stream may affect do and doc concentration in river basin and watershed model thereby importantly supporting decision making to solve water quality degradation and aquatic ecosystem conservation therefore many studies on the impacts of do fc and doc on water quality and hydrological process in many parts of the world including the athabasca river basin arb have been performed using different hydrological models i e hspf mode swat model mike21 model fonseca et al 2014 shrestha et al 2017

they found that increased flows through the upper soil horizon due to snow melt cause flushing of doc to the rivers some other researchers have modelled doc concentrations in the water utilities within the usa using different hydrological models which consider the impact on water quality ågren et al 2010 samson et al 2016 lessels et al 2015 employed a coupled hydrology biogeochemistry model of doc model in high latitude headwaters and the doc production was evaluated based on the soil organic carbon soc pool and soil moisture in their model the in stream doc processes on aquatic ecosystem were not incorporated other studies employed a process based model of do and doc which incorporated the doc do and soil carbon into stream modelling futter et al 2007 rahman and salbe 1995 the hydrology biogeochemistry doc model developed by lessels et al 2015 did not incorporate aquatic cycling and relevant impact on aquatic ecosystems recently some studies investigated the effects of fc on health of both humans and animals kloot et al 2006 coffey et al 2010 and cho et al 2012 applied the soil and water assessment tool a swat to the prediction of fc fate and transport kim et al

et al 2019b to provide a comprehensive prediction about the effect of stream temperature on water quality and aquatic ecosystem despite many successes the impacts of combined do doc and fc on water quality and aquatic ecosystems has not been incorporated into the swat model to date to the best of our knowledge no studies have been reported the use of extended swat model considering fc do doc concentrations and their combined effects on aquatic species and therefore remains to be evaluated furthermore cold regions require to specifically be treated due to effects of snow melt glacial

swat is a watershed scale based model that operates on a continuous daily time step neitsch et al 2011 shawul et al 2013 worku et al 2017 the swat model is used to simulate the hydrological process nutrient loss and pesticides runoff and sediment yield into the surface groundwater in large and complex watershed with different landuse and soil conditions halefom et al 2017 sisay et al 2017 it is also used to simulate the impacts of landuse and management practices on water quality and quantity in the model the watershed is divided into multiple sub basins based on homogenous landuse slopes and soil types of hydrological response unit hru during the simulation process point and non point source loads from the hru are assumed and the resulting loads are routed through streams to the watershed in addition agricultural chemicals such as bacteria nutrients and pesticides are operated by simulating from aquatic and landscape environments detail process of swat model descriptions are found from neitsch et al 2011 2 3 application of swat model for cold climate regions 2 3 1 dissolved oxygen in swat model biological oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen are the two most important water quality parameters needed to assess the waste assimilative capacity of water and significant for the survival of aquatic species since do simulation is correlated with the other elements the

models the fate and transport of the pollutants at a watershed scale with an inclusive of both in the land surface and aquatic systems the land surface used to simulate the fate and transport of organic carbon in the soil layers in the swat model from the hydrological response unit while the aquatic surface receives the load from the land surface routine and model the fate and movement of organic carbons in the water bodies the doc concentrations in the soil water and water column are required to simulate a three phase partitioning for organic chemicals for doc concentration in soil water the organic matter om and a parameter representing as the fraction of dissolved organic carbon in order to obtain the concentrations in various soil layers ligaray et al 2016 the doc can be obtained using the following equation 6 cdoc s o l f d o c o m where cdoc soil is the doc concentration in the soil water mg l om is the concentration of organic matter mg l and fdoc is the fraction of doc model parameter the determination of organic matter om was simulated using swat parameters by dividing the mass of soil organic carbon in the som soil organic matter with soil water content ligaray et al 2016 du et al 2019c 2 3 2 1 aquatic dissolved organic carbon process in kragh and søndergaard 2009 classification dissolved organic carbon is grouped into refractory rdoc and liable ldoc pools the stream dissolved organic carbon module receives loadings from the upstream downstream reaches the procedures of stream doc are calculated by adapting and combining the kinetics of ce qual w2 cole and wells 2006 and qual2k chapra and pelletier 2003 the sign of positive or negative terms for rdoc and ldoc in the water bodies shows the kinetic variability in concentrations along with time the transformation of liable dissolved organic carbon ldoc kinetics routine increasing the concentration of ldoc are particulate organic carbon dissolution to the ldoc whereas those kinetics reducing the concentration of ldoc are the ldoc decay to refractory dissolved organic carbon and liable dissolved organic carbon mineralization to inorganic carbon the kinetic changes of concentration of

model setup in the athabasca river basin the athabasca river basin arb was delineated into sub basins and stream networks a total of 131 sub basins were found for hru definition different soil types and landuse classes were defined and based on homogenous landuse type soil and slope classifications a total of 1370 hru were defined for the basin meteorological data like precipitation temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation record of different stations for the basin were obtained from https agriculture alberta ca acis alberta weather data viewer jsp and was used as model input the samples were collected daily in each month at a monitoring station from athabasca river d s of devils elbow at winter road crossing ab07dd0105 a athabasca river at old entrance town site

in the fig 1 2 5 water quality index calculation for aquatic ecosystem for the purpose of quantifying ecological status of water we obtained the water quality index wqi based on alberta environment and parks aep 2017 guideline it considers different aspects of water quality a the scope represented by f1 such as do doc and fc variables therefore during the index period at least two of them failed their respective objective at least once b frequency which is represented by f2 and c the amplitude which represented by f3 the value of wqi ranges between 0 bad quality to 100 best water quality

of alberta environment and parks http aep alberta ca water reports data surface water quality data default aspx were employed for model calibration and validation the doc do and fc concentration data in the stream provided by the above address were used for model calibration and validation the calibration period is extended from 2010 to 2014 including warmup periods and validation period is from 2015 to 2017 in order to compare the performance of model simulation against the observations both qualitative and quantitative measure scatter plots and time series plots were employed which is used show the trend possible sources of errors and variation between observed and simulated values to conduct the parameter sensitivity and uncertainty analysis we employed sequential uncertainty fitting2 sufi2 algorithm in swat cup arnold et al 1998 abbaspour and vedjani 2007 the global sensitivity analysis in swat cup has been employed for sensitivity analysis in order to investigate the impact of do doc and fc on aquatic ecosystem and overall water quality parameters were selected and considered for model calibration and validation swat cup has been run for 500 iterations based on lower and upper bounds the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was employed as objectives function and with the iteration value of nse seen as maximum parameter set furthermore to evaluate the model performance coefficient of determination r2 and percentage bias pbias were employed chen et al 2017 the descriptions of nse r2 and pbias can be found in moriasi et al 2015 the overall model performance ratings can be calculated using the following equation 20 r 2 i 1 n o i o avr p i p avr i 1 n o i o avr 2 i 1 n p i p avr 2 2 21 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o avr 2 22 pbias i 1 n ob s

results and discussion 3 1 model parameter sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to do the model performance assessment the whole dataset was divided into the periods of calibration 2010 2014 and validation 2015 2017 before the swat model calibration and validation process initially tested the sensitivity analysis to identify most sensitive parameters that govern do doc and fc a model sensitivity analysis can be done to find the relative response of the model to changes in the value of specific model parameters therefore sensitivity analysis is used to decide the most important parameters that govern the system processes in order to correctly simulate the extended swat model nineteen most sensitive parameters controlling do doc and fc were tested based on the values obtained during initial model calibration rk2 swq is the most sensitive parameter among the do parameters which affect the concentration of do in water bodies kd oc is the most sensitive parameter from the overall doc parameters which affects doc concentration on the other hand temperature adjustment factor thbac is one of the most sensitive parameters controlling the concentration of fc in general the parameters listed in table 2 were found to be the most sensitive parameters the results of the most sensitive analysis specify that all the measured input parameters have a significant influence on the model prediction therefore during simulation periods 19 most sensitive parameters were selected as the model inputs table 2 in order to calibrate the swat model the model simulated outputs were compared with observations therefore the daily observed data do doc and fc at different stations in the athabasca river basin arb were used for the model calibration and validation to assess the model performance the range of selected parameters are shown in table 2 and swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup were performed for calibrating variables associated with the most sensitive parameters of the modified swat module in order to calibrate the updated swat module latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat was employed 3 2 model calibration and validation performance in order to perfectly predict the concentration of do doc and fc in water bodies and associated effect on aquatic ecosystem in the arb the status as simulated by the swat model necessarily confirm to what is the watershed condition therefore the daily observed data from different monitoring stations were employed for the model calibration to assess the model performance the swat model performance measure for daily bases are listed in table 3 based on the model performance ratings according to r2 nse and pbias during the model calibration and validation periods were satisfactory to very good performance ratings 3 3 do concentration modelling in different temporal scale the level of do in the water bodies is a function of water temperature bod doc and nitrification throughout the arb the concentration of do showed decreasing in distribution fig 2 the concentration for do was ranges 5 12 mg l in winter 1 11 mg l in spring 1 7 mg l for summer and 5 13 mg l for autumn some of the largest decreases in summer and spring do are likely to take place in the arb watershed refer to fig 3 where do for some monitoring station is likely to reduce to an average of 3 4 mg l from 8 to 9 mg l during the spring and summer seasons figs 2 and 3 well this is below the lower limit to maintain the aquatic life of 5 mg l crisp 1993 higher water temperatures persisted from early june to august it should be clear that even though at some points do concentration values remain above 5 mg l these concentration values represent the seasonal averages and one can assume lower values possibly for prolonged periods throughout the season the do levels indicate that the simulation mirrored successfully the filed observation the concentrations of do fell below the moderate production of the loss thresholds of 5 mg l in almost all measured locations during summer in the arb figs 3 and 4 concentrations of do dropped below 5 mg l for extended period in which is not suitable for the existence of aquatic ecosystem even during the year 2013 dropped below 2 mg l 1 06 mg l in ab07dd0105 station but the uppermost reach of the ab07dd0010 station 3 4 fecal coliform concentrations modelling for different temporal scale the modelling process for fecal coliforms fc was achieved through the adjustment of seven most sensitive associated parameters shown in table 2 the calibration and validation approach were based on the daily values against the observed values from different monitoring stations of the arb the calibration was achieved when predictions in water bodies concentrations were approach to the observed values using suitable parameters range values imhoff et al 1981 if the concentration of simulated values were too high or too low the number of simulations were accomplished by changing the parameter values within reasonable limits the aim of validation in this study was demonstrated in the applicability of the swat model to various conditions in the arb by comparing the model predictions with measured data the daily concentration indicates that the model is successful for all variables in which the validation reproduces satisfactory results the daily average balance fig 2 indicates that the modified swat model is successfully matched for all stations even though at some point over estimation has been observed this could be due to the criteria employed in bit bacteria indicator tool concerning animals distribution or due to sampling stations because these are random samplings without any kind of masseurs to control in addition it could be subjected to various meteorological as well as hydrological conditions the calibrated and validated values using modified swat model results were evaluated by the comparison of r2 pbias and nse criteria mentioned in tables 2 and 3 the results indicated in table 3 satisfactory to very good relationship for all coefficient in all stations except at station ab07ad0100 for the coefficient of pbias during validation indicated a value inferior to positive for fc the seasonal concentration trends were examined for each season winter december to february spring march to may summer june to august and autumn september to november showed in fig 5 high level average concentrations of fc were observed during summer and spring 34 cfu 100 ml and 24 cfu 100 ml respectively on the other hand lower level of fc concentrations were observed during autumn and winter lower level of concentrations were observed 0 65 cfu 100 ml and 2 cfu 100 ml respectively specifically at some point the concentrations in the study area elevated beyond allowed concentration for human consumption the observed values were 209 cfu 100 ml in 2011 136 cfu 100 ml in 2016 respectively at station ab07be0010 and ab07cc0030 which indicates in the study area water quality deterioration below water quality standard severe for human health and survival of aquatic species 3 5 doc concentration simulation performance at different temporal scales following modification in the swat model the doc processes were then calibrated on the daily time scale using the estimated doc concentrations the swat model performance ratings for the daily time scale are shown in table 2 conferring to the swat model performance ratings depend on the values of nse r2 and pbias the doc concentration simulation performances at the time of calibration and validation were found to be satisfactory to very good for some parts of the monitoring stations ab07dd0105 ab07be0010 and ab07cc0030 found to be underestimated with negative values for pbias which were due to doc concentration found to be underestimated during the high flow periods the comparison of observed and simulated daily doc concentrations series is showed in figs 2 and 4 the comparison between observed and simulated showed that the swat model could provide acceptable doc concentration simulations as of the swat model predictions follow a similar trend to the observed data and able to capture well the daily base within reasonable ranges the spatio temporal distribution of doc concentrations dropdown to 0 65 mg l during autumn 0 71 mg l for winter 0 86 mg l for summer and 1 mg l for spring which is by far lower 5 mg l than the required level for water quality 3 6 impacts of water quality caused by do on aquatic species the time series comparison of observed vs simulated do values indicates reasonable swat model performance for do in which the swat model captures the seasonal variability of do like higher autumn do concentrations 5 mg l and lower summer and spring concentrations 5 mg l fig 3 as observed from the figs 2 and 3 the concentration of do dropped quite significantly during summer and spring months the pattern of measured do has been improved represented by the simulated results of the new swat model the concentration of do in stream will alter the spatiotemporal distribution of aquatic species in the arb spatially in most stations concentration of do shown in fig 3 is decreasing temporally during summer season stream temperature will obviously increase and consequently the concentration of do decreasing compared to other seasons the decreasing do concentration will affect aquatic species in different aspects as indicated by caissie et al 2007 aquatic species generally has a specific range of do that they can tolerate and any changes in stream do concentration may have any adverse effect on the overall habitats predominantly if the average do concentration in stream exceeds do threshold various habitats e g fish in water bodies expected to either migrate or die at the worst case null et al 2013 therefore decrease of the stream do concentration in the arb particularly such noticeable decrease in summer season would have adverse effect on the cold water fish species in colder snow covered conditions like arb simulated do indicates relatively diurnal constancy due to lower metabolism at lower water temperatures lower bacterial activity and restricted reaeration intern affects the decay of organic matter and nitrification inline with kwak et al 2017 and du et al 2019c potential decreases in stream do concentration during summer season would have adverse effect on the fish species the favoured do concentration ranges and the upper fish tolerance do for the three main fish species such as walleye northern pike and salmon in the arb were shown in table 4 because of low do in freshwater aquatic systems particularly during summer season is important in the bottom water layers of stratified water columns which is important to evaluate the effect of low do changes in the fish community structure caused by low level of do are increasingly likely justus et al 2014 lower level of do concentrations caused lethal and sublethal behavioural and physiological effects on various organisms in general and fish in particular the concentrations decrease below the thresholds i e 5 gm l the species richness will decrease as the acute lethal thresholds for individual species are surpassed to understand the potential effect on the three main fish species we obtained the number of days within favoured do ranges and the exceeding upper tolerance dos during the peak season table 4 and figs 2 and 3 lower concentrations of do in mg l creates hypoxic conditions for aquatic ecosystems particularly for fish species in line with magoulick and kobza 2003 fish species may tolerate short term exposure to the hypoxia very few able to persist in minimal do concentrations the growth rates for the fish species listed in the table 4 are impaired at do concentrations below 5 mg l the overall growth rate is reduced up to 22 when the concentrations are lower than 6 mg l and fish mortality happens at 3 mg l carter 2005 the thresholds for this study assume moderate loss begins at 6 mg l and severe loss occurs at the concentrations of do below 5 mg l decrease in do concentration due to increasing in stream temperature will result in decreasing the water quality ficklin et al 2013 and this is true in the arb furthermore the lower do concentration particularly during summer season fig 3 would specify that decrease in the concentration of do would be worse the results indicated that in most of the basins in the arb the concentration of do is decreasing in order to maintain the life of aquatic ecosystems the availability of enough do is important and therefore decrease in concentration would have negative influence on the aquatic species survival in addition to water quality 3 7 water quality concentration for aquatic ecosystems the wqi calculated using various aspects of water quality using equation and the scores shown in table 1 indicates that water quality of arb rated between fair to excellent in all stations for do concentration during in autumn and winter however the concentrations were found to be poor at ab07dd0010 ab07ad0100 and ab07dd0105 during the summer season the water quality impairments tend to increase in the downstream reaches of the river basin the cwqi suggests that a spatial improvement in the water quality has been observed based on the do concentrations except for summer and spring seasons as indicated in table 5 in line with our study the impairments of water quality prominently are from the contribution of agricultural practices and the decrease in do concentration is as result of increase in stream temperature shrestha and wang 2018 the decrease in concentration of do in space and time were indicated by fig 3 deficiency of do causes asphyxiation and distract the survival of fish spices in the river basin which will cause migration during the critical periods and to the worst case they will die similarly doc concentrations of arb were varied in distribution and reduced in concentration level table 5 and fig 4 in which the seasonal doc distribution vary between 0 65 mg l and 10 mg l however the doc concentrations in most monitoring sites decreased below the required level 5 mg l lower level of doc below the required level causes for impairment of drinking water quality and aquatic ecosystem survival as can be shown in table 5 and fig 5 higher fc concentrations in all stations during summer and spring which causes for reducing the health of water quality considering the concentration of fc it exceeds the water quality standards allowed the overall quality of water in the arb is a result of various diffused sources of pollution for all the parameters which were addressed in our study as per water quality standards which was established by the council of directive 75 440 eec 1975 even though the concentrations of fc are under the range of required level it has been higher in some of the observed stations such as summer spring and autumn of the arb the concentrations of fc simulated profiles are associated to the input from bacteria indicator which is related to accumulation of pollution from various sources such as livestock and piggeries farms 4 conclusions we developed processed based integrated algorithms linking do doc and fc with aquatic ecosystem and water quality within the swat model the model was tested using monitoring data of do doc and fc from 2010 to 2017 in the athabasca river basin the results show that the extended swat model was able to capture the processes at the watershed scale the simulation results also indicate that modified swat model achieved satisfactory to very good performances for all stations at daily time scale however during validation the simulation performance showed conflicting results particularly the value of pbias at the stations ab07dd0010 and ab07ad0100 shows negative values it is found that there is highly seasonal do variation in the athabasca river basin the substantial changes in water quality are therefore less suitable for aquatic ecosystems survival these changes seem to be especially sensitive to the summer and spring and parts of snow covered winter seasons the concentrations of do revealed a distinct temporal pattern with the lowest decrease below the 5 mg l do levels in order to maintain the aquatic life during spring and summer seasons and even at some points drop as low as 2 4 mg l during the summer months such decreasing do concentrations would affect the dynamics of water quality in the arb particularly the marked decreases predicted in some seasons in all the monitoring stations summer winter and some other snow covered seasons would possibly affect the aquatic species especially fishes in the abr likewise doc concentrations dropdown to 0 65 mg l during autumn 0 71 mg l for winter 0 86 mg l for summer and 1 mg l for spring which is by far lower 5 mg l than the required level for water quality the decreases in concentration of do resulted mainly from the rise in water temperature and decrease in volume of stream flow leading to decreasing the saturation as well as the carrying capacity for do concurrent with do and doc concentrations the concentration of fc revealed a substantial increase the results of this study revealed that the marked decrease in spatial concentrations of do was lower than the minimal tolerance do of some fishes this implied more potential threat for the main fish species northern pick walleye and salmon fish in the arb therefore it is of vital importance to adjust the site specific sustainable management practices in order to increase water quality and aquatic ecosystem survival for the river basin this is evidenced by our simulation results which were successfully done after coupling those parameters into swat model and provide a vital modelling tool for aquatic ecosystem management at the watershed scale credit authorship contribution statement

5408,cold climate regions offer various ecosystem services the water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen do water temperature tw and dissolved organic carbon doc have considerable impacts on the aquatic ecosystem species any impairments in water quality such as elevated water temperature and low do concentrations can limit the survival of aquatic ecosystems and its species such as walleye northern pike and salmon therefore a good understanding of the aquatic ecosystem of rivers is essential for effective and sustainable river basin and watershed management of fisheries and aquatic resources the objectives of this study is to improve a watershed scale module of water quality do doc and fecal coliforms fc in the swat model to examine the spatiotemporal patterns and their impacts on aquatic ecosystem and water quality processes in the athabasca river basin arb alberta canada the calibration and validation results of do doc and fc show that the improved soil and water assessment tool swat model achieved successfully with a varied range satisfactory to vey good of accuracy at the daily temporal scales the results showed that concentrations of do for the selected stations spring and summer reduced far below the thresholds for ecosystems survival in concurrent reduction with do the fc concentration considerably varied in the different monitoring stations of arb these results highlight that do doc and fc variability in the arb may drive changes in water quality and ecosystem services that have to be understood on the specific research scale for designing adaptive management scenarios this study reveals that the new swat model can be applied to other similar regions of the worlds keywords ecosystem water quality swat model dissolved oxygen dissolved organic carbon fecal coliforms 1 introduction the health of river systems is of critical importance for sustainable economic development and biodiversity however human activities global population growth and climate change can change river systems leading to degradation of water quality and aquatic habitat and loss of biodiversity dudgeon 2014 reid et al 2019 therefore sustainable management of river systems requires a fundamental understanding of how ecosystem processes and functions respond to change of natural and anthropogenic drivers water quality parameters like dissolved oxygen do fecal coliform fc sediment concentration and dissolved organic carbon doc are significant indicators in the aquatic species distribution and health zhu et al 2018 and play a significant role in regulating water resources for human use and aquatic habitat health caldwell et al 2015 several studies have showed that deterioration of water quality resulted in degradation of ecology dudgeon 2014 reid et al 2019 fish diseases as well as mortality has been observed on various occasions in the water bodies zhang et al 2012 therefore quantifying water quality i e do doc and fc variations in time and space and its impacts on aquatic ecosystem are an important to know about human induced and other sources of pollutants to the aquatic system bouraoui and grizzetti 2014 zhang 2018 in the surface water systems doc of terrestrial carbon storage undergoes reaction and transport processes in the aquatic environment cole et al 2007 monteith et al 2007 and whitehead et al 2009 reported that doc concentrations in surface waters across north america and europe could increase more than 50 of the total doc transported from land surface to the water bodies even though doc is not a toxic contaminant it could hinder the surface water quality by helping the transport of various contaminants and therefore form toxic compounds for instance the concentration of doc directly affects the toxic heavy metals and other organic partitioning processes allison and allison 2005 du et al 2019a melaku and wang 2019 heavy loading of organic matter that transported into water bodies is responsible for the reduction of do in the aquatic bodies moreover the transport of wastewater into the lagoons resulted in huge environmental problems for both drinking water quality and aquatic ecosystem de godos et al 2010 high concentrations of doc could hinder surface water availability by acting as decontamination of by products precursors it could combine with the chlorine as a disinfectant in water supply systems and produce probable carcinogenic compounds chowdhury et al 2009 it has been found by pandey et al 2013 and pandey et al 2014 that point and nonpoint sources particularly animal waste could lead to an abrupt increase in concentration of fecal coliforms fc and high water contamination in squaw creek watershed an integrated modelling approach considering different sources of pollution and their effects on water bodies is needed for the best management of river basins since the individual components of various wastewater systems could not represent performance of the whole system reußner et al 2008 freni et al 2011 assuming the significance of do doc and fc in water bodies for fresh water health it is critical to recognize how different natural and human drivers such as soil and water conservation landuse climate changes and restoration of stream may affect do and doc concentration in river basin and watershed model thereby importantly supporting decision making to solve water quality degradation and aquatic ecosystem conservation therefore many studies on the impacts of do fc and doc on water quality and hydrological process in many parts of the world including the athabasca river basin arb have been performed using different hydrological models i e hspf mode swat model mike21 model fonseca et al 2014 shrestha et al 2017

they found that increased flows through the upper soil horizon due to snow melt cause flushing of doc to the rivers some other researchers have modelled doc concentrations in the water utilities within the usa using different hydrological models which consider the impact on water quality ågren et al 2010 samson et al 2016 lessels et al 2015 employed a coupled hydrology biogeochemistry model

the hydrology biogeochemistry doc model developed by lessels et al 2015 did not incorporate aquatic cycling and relevant impact on aquatic ecosystems recently some studies investigated the effects of fc on health of both humans and animals kloot et al 2006 coffey et al 2010 and cho et al 2012 applied the soil and water assessment tool a swat to the prediction of fc fate and transport kim et al 2010 employed modified swat module to account for stream fc release and deposition and the effect of solar radiation on the fc die off however none of them have simulated of fc concentration in a water body water quality and ecosystem health some studies have employed modelling to incorporate equilibrium temperature into modified swat model for stream temperature modeling ficklin et al 2012 du et al 2019b to provide a comprehensive prediction about the effect of stream temperature on water quality and aquatic ecosystem despite many successes the impacts of combined do doc and fc on water quality and aquatic ecosystems has not been incorporated into the swat model to date to the best of our knowledge no studies have been reported the use of extended swat model considering fc do doc concentrations and their combined effects on aquatic species and therefore remains to be evaluated furthermore cold regions require to specifically be treated due to effects of snow melt glacial retreat permafrost and freeze thaw cycles on the aquatic species and water quality in watershed scale swat model the objectives of this study is to 1 develop watershed scale module of do doc and fc in the swat model to evaluate their spatiotemporal variations in the athabasca river basin arb 2 evaluate impacts of do fc and doc on aquatic ecosystem and water quality processes 3 perform model uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to comprehend probable limitations and confer future direction in model development efforts and 4 investigate seasonal variation of do doc and fc concentration 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the athabasca river basin arb the study area is shown in fig 1 athabasca river basin is known by cold climate conditions it is found in the center of alberta province in canada which have significant contribution to the economy of the province by supplying dependable water provision to different industries and local communities awc 2011 forest is the main landcover accounting for about 82 of the whole basin area followed by agricultural land 9 5 in general agriculture forest coal mining pulp mills traditional oil and gas extraction and oil sand mining are the major industries in the area awc 2013 the mean annual precipitation of the basin ranges from 300 mm from the downstream to over 1000 mm in the headwater whereas the mean annual temperature recorded 1 8 c in the upper 5 1 c middle and 3 5 c in the lower basin dibike et al 2018 2 2 soil and water assessment tool swat description soil and water assessment tool swat is a watershed scale based model that operates on a continuous daily time step neitsch et al 2011 shawul et al 2013 worku et al 2017 the swat model is used to simulate the hydrological process nutrient loss and pesticides runoff and sediment yield into the surface groundwater in large and complex watershed with different landuse and soil conditions halefom et al 2017 sisay et al 2017 it is also used to simulate the impacts of landuse and management practices on water quality and quantity in the model the watershed is divided into multiple sub basins based on homogenous landuse slopes and soil types of hydrological response unit hru during the simulation process point and non point source loads from the hru are assumed and the resulting loads are routed through streams to the watershed in addition agricultural chemicals such as bacteria nutrients and pesticides are operated by simulating from aquatic and landscape environments detail process of swat model descriptions are found from neitsch et al 2011 2 3 application of swat model for cold climate regions 2 3 1 dissolved oxygen in swat model biological oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen are the two most important water quality parameters needed to assess the waste assimilative capacity of water and significant for the survival of aquatic species since do simulation is correlated with the other elements the concentration of do was obtain as a fraction of saturated dissolved oxygen sdo concentration and biochemical oxygen demand bod dynamics therefore proper modelling provides the transportation mechanism for water quality constitutes donigian 2002 in the soil and water assessment tool swat model the concentration of do is obtained based on water temperature in the stream as discussed in neitsch et al

and algal respiration water air flux cbod deoxygenation sediment oxygen demand and nitrification 2 3 1 1 reaeration dissolved oxygen concentration exchange between water body and the atmosphere in case there is imbalance between the water and air phase resulted from the do mass balance in the absence of the sinks therefore the reaeration process adapted from gualtieri et al 2002 can be obtained using the following equation 2 c t c s c 0 c s exp k a t where c is the concentration of dissolved oxygen mg l 1 c0 is concentration of initial dissolved oxygen mgl 1 ka is reaeration coefficient day 1 cs is ssaturation dissolved oxygen concentration and t is time in days in addition water temperature other factors like total dissolved solids tds dissolved organic carbon and atmospheric pressure and other nutrients also affect the concentration of dissolved oxygen modelling do in swat model considered many processes bicknell et al 1997 in our study the investigation of dissolved oxygen concentration change is using equation 1 using only water temperature see equation 5 as the input which is a simplification of much more complex processes since the rate of chemical reaction affected by stream temperature the impact on the biochemical oxygen demand dynamics will examine by assessing the impact on the carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand cbod decay rate biological oxygen demand serve as a metric for the overall health of aquatic ecosystems on the other hand it used to show the rate of oxygen uptake by the micro organism in water and can be defined as the definite test for organic pollution of rivers on the other hand the bod decay processes and nitrification denitrification disturb the do bod balance in the water rahman and salbe 1995 the decay rate for biological oxygen demand are temperature dependent decay twater adapted from benham et al 2006 in the swat model cbod decay rate in the stream was adjusted using an exponential equation based on simulated

content of precipitation may be optional qe is the heat transport from evaporation and qbed is the net heat exchange with bed water temperature is one of the factors to determine the concertation of dissolved oxygen therefore the following equation is employed to obtain the water temperature which has been adapted from fonseca et al 2014 5 delttw cvqt q t 1 s p d c v q t where delttw is the change in water temperature c cvqt is the conversion factor used convert the total heat exchange stated in kcal m 2 interval 1 to c interval 1 which is volume dependent spd is the sum of the partial

models the fate and transport of the pollutants at a watershed scale with an inclusive of both in the land surface and aquatic systems the land surface used to simulate the fate and transport of organic carbon in the soil layers in the swat model from the hydrological response unit while the aquatic surface receives the load from the land surface routine and model the fate and movement of organic carbons in the water bodies the doc concentrations in the soil water and water column are required to simulate a three phase partitioning for organic chemicals for doc concentration in soil water the organic matter om and a parameter representing as the fraction of dissolved organic carbon in order to obtain the concentrations in various soil layers ligaray et al 2016 the doc can be obtained using the following equation 6 cdoc s o l f d o c o m where cdoc soil is the doc concentration in the soil water mg l om is the concentration of organic matter mg l and fdoc is the fraction of doc model parameter the determination of organic matter om was simulated using swat parameters by dividing the mass of soil organic carbon in the som soil organic matter with soil water content ligaray et al 2016 du et al 2019c 2 3 2 1 aquatic dissolved organic carbon process in kragh and søndergaard 2009 classification dissolved organic carbon is grouped into refractory rdoc and liable ldoc pools the stream dissolved organic carbon module receives loadings from the upstream downstream reaches the procedures of stream doc are calculated by adapting and combining the kinetics of ce qual w2 cole and wells 2006 and qual2k chapra and pelletier 2003 the sign of positive or negative terms for rdoc and ldoc in the water bodies shows the kinetic variability in concentrations along with time the transformation of liable dissolved organic carbon ldoc kinetics routine increasing the concentration of ldoc are particulate organic carbon dissolution to the ldoc whereas those kinetics reducing the concentration of ldoc are the ldoc decay to refractory dissolved organic carbon and liable dissolved organic carbon mineralization to inorganic carbon the kinetic changes of concentration of liable dissolved organic carbon in respect of time are obtained using the following equation du et al 2019d 7 l d o c t f ldocp k dp t x r ca a p e c o s y s t e m m o r t a l i t y a p l d o c 8 k

model setup in the athabasca river basin the athabasca river basin arb was delineated into sub basins and stream networks a total of 131 sub basins were found for hru definition different soil types and landuse classes were defined and based on homogenous landuse type soil and slope classifications a total of 1370 hru were defined for the basin meteorological data like precipitation temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation record of different stations for the basin were obtained from https agriculture alberta ca acis alberta weather data viewer jsp and was used as model input the samples were collected daily in each month at a monitoring station from athabasca river d s of devils elbow at winter road crossing ab07dd0105 a athabasca river at old entrance town site

in the fig 1 2 5 water quality index calculation for aquatic ecosystem for the purpose of quantifying ecological status of water we obtained the water quality index wqi based on alberta environment and parks aep 2017 guideline it considers different aspects of water quality a the scope represented by f1 such as do doc and fc variables therefore during the index period at least two of them failed their respective objective at least once b frequency which is represented by f2 and c the amplitude which represented by f3 the value of wqi ranges between 0 bad quality to 100 best water quality table 1 based on the wqi values a qualitative rating was assigned to the river water in a river basin the overall wqi was obtained using the following equations f 1 number o f f a i l e d v a r i a b

of alberta environment and parks http aep alberta ca water reports data surface water quality data default aspx were employed for model calibration and validation the doc do and fc concentration data in the stream provided by the above address were used for model calibration and validation the calibration period is extended from 2010 to 2014 including warmup periods and validation period is from 2015 to 2017 in order to compare the performance of model simulation against the observations both qualitative and quantitative measure scatter plots and time series plots were employed which is used show the trend possible sources of errors and variation between observed and simulated values to conduct the parameter sensitivity and uncertainty analysis we employed sequential uncertainty fitting2 sufi2 algorithm in swat cup arnold et al 1998 abbaspour and vedjani 2007 the global sensitivity analysis in swat cup has been employed for sensitivity analysis in order to investigate the impact of do doc and fc on aquatic ecosystem and overall water quality parameters were selected and considered for model calibration and validation swat cup has been run for 500 iterations based on lower and upper bounds the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was employed as objectives function and with the iteration value of nse seen as maximum parameter set furthermore to evaluate the model performance coefficient of determination r2 and percentage bias pbias were employed chen et al 2017 the descriptions of nse r2 and pbias can be found in moriasi et al 2015 the overall model performance ratings can be calculated using the following equation 20 r 2 i 1 n o i o avr p i p avr i 1 n o i o avr 2 i 1 n p i p avr 2 2 21 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o avr 2 22 pbias i 1 n ob s

results and discussion 3 1 model parameter sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to do the model performance assessment the whole dataset was divided into the periods of calibration 2010 2014 and validation 2015 2017 before the swat model calibration and validation process initially tested the sensitivity analysis to identify most sensitive parameters that govern do doc and fc a model sensitivity analysis can be done to find the relative response of the model to changes in the value of specific model parameters therefore sensitivity analysis is used to decide the most important parameters that govern the system processes in order to correctly simulate the extended swat model nineteen most sensitive parameters controlling do doc and fc were tested based on the values obtained during initial model calibration rk2 swq is the most sensitive parameter among the do parameters which affect the concentration of do in water bodies kd oc is the most sensitive parameter from the overall doc parameters which affects doc concentration on the other hand temperature adjustment factor thbac is one of the most sensitive parameters controlling the concentration of fc in general the parameters listed in table 2 were found to be the most sensitive parameters the results of the most sensitive analysis specify that all the measured input parameters have a significant influence on the model prediction therefore during simulation periods 19 most sensitive parameters were selected as the model inputs table 2 in order to calibrate the swat model the model simulated outputs were compared with observations therefore the daily observed data do doc and fc at different stations in the athabasca river basin arb were used for the model calibration and validation to assess the model performance the range of selected parameters are shown in table 2 and swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup were performed for calibrating variables associated with the most sensitive parameters of the modified swat module in order to calibrate the updated swat module latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat was employed 3 2 model calibration and validation performance in order to perfectly predict the concentration of do doc and fc in water bodies and associated effect on aquatic ecosystem in the arb the status as simulated by the swat model necessarily confirm to what is the watershed condition therefore the daily observed data from different monitoring stations were employed for the model calibration to assess the model performance the swat model performance measure for daily bases are listed in table 3 based on the model performance ratings according to r2 nse and pbias during the model calibration and validation periods were satisfactory to very good performance ratings 3 3 do concentration modelling in different temporal scale the level of do in the water bodies is a function of water temperature bod doc and nitrification throughout the arb the concentration of do showed decreasing in distribution fig 2 the concentration for do was ranges 5 12 mg l in winter 1 11 mg l in spring 1 7 mg l for summer and 5 13 mg l for autumn some of the largest decreases in summer and spring do are likely to take place in the arb watershed refer to fig 3 where do for some monitoring station is likely to reduce to an average of 3 4 mg l from 8 to 9 mg l during the spring and summer seasons figs 2 and 3 well this is below the lower limit to maintain the aquatic life of 5 mg l crisp 1993 higher water temperatures persisted from early june to august it should be clear that even though at some points do concentration values remain above 5 mg l these concentration values represent the seasonal averages and one can assume lower values possibly for prolonged periods throughout the season the do levels indicate that the simulation mirrored successfully the filed observation the concentrations of do fell below the moderate production of the loss thresholds of 5 mg l in almost all measured locations during summer in the arb figs 3 and 4 concentrations of do dropped below 5 mg l for extended period in which is not suitable for the existence of aquatic ecosystem even during the year 2013 dropped below 2 mg l 1 06 mg l in ab07dd0105 station but the uppermost reach of the ab07dd0010 station 3 4 fecal coliform concentrations modelling for different temporal scale the modelling process for fecal coliforms fc was achieved through the adjustment of seven most sensitive associated parameters shown in table 2 the calibration and validation approach were based on the daily values against the observed values from different monitoring stations of the arb the calibration was achieved when predictions in water bodies concentrations were approach to the observed values using suitable parameters range values imhoff et al 1981 if the concentration of simulated values were too high or too low the number of simulations were accomplished by changing the parameter values within reasonable limits the aim of validation in this study was demonstrated in the applicability of the swat model to various conditions in the arb by comparing the model predictions with measured data the daily concentration indicates that the model is successful for all variables in which the validation reproduces satisfactory results the daily average balance fig 2 indicates that the modified swat model is successfully matched for all stations even though at some point over estimation has been observed this could be due to the criteria employed in bit bacteria indicator tool concerning animals distribution or due to sampling stations because these are random samplings without any kind of masseurs to control in addition it could be subjected to various meteorological as well as hydrological conditions the calibrated and validated values using modified swat model results were evaluated by the comparison of r2 pbias and nse criteria mentioned in tables 2 and 3 the results indicated in table 3 satisfactory to very good relationship for all coefficient in all stations except at station ab07ad0100 for the coefficient of pbias during validation indicated a value inferior to positive for fc the seasonal concentration trends were examined for each season winter december to february spring march to may summer june to august and autumn september to november showed in fig 5 high level average concentrations of fc were observed during summer and spring 34 cfu 100 ml and 24 cfu 100 ml respectively on the other hand lower level of fc concentrations were observed during autumn and winter lower level of concentrations were observed 0 65 cfu 100 ml and 2 cfu 100 ml respectively specifically at some point the concentrations in the study area elevated beyond allowed concentration for human consumption the observed values were 209 cfu 100 ml in 2011 136 cfu 100 ml in 2016 respectively at station ab07be0010 and ab07cc0030 which indicates in the study area water quality deterioration below water quality standard severe for human health and survival of aquatic species 3 5 doc concentration simulation performance at different temporal scales following modification in the swat model the doc processes were then calibrated on the daily time scale using the estimated doc concentrations the swat model performance ratings for the daily time scale are shown in table 2 conferring to the swat model performance ratings depend on the values of nse r2 and pbias the doc concentration simulation performances at the time of calibration and validation were found to be satisfactory to very good for some parts of the monitoring stations ab07dd0105 ab07be0010 and ab07cc0030 found to be underestimated with negative values for pbias which were due to doc concentration found to be underestimated during the high flow periods the comparison of observed and simulated daily doc concentrations series is showed in figs 2 and 4 the comparison between observed and simulated showed that the swat model could provide acceptable doc concentration simulations as of the swat model predictions follow a similar trend to the observed data and able to capture well the daily base within reasonable ranges the spatio temporal distribution of doc concentrations dropdown to 0 65 mg l during autumn 0 71 mg l for winter 0 86 mg l for summer and 1 mg l for spring which is by far lower 5 mg l than the required level for water quality 3 6 impacts of water quality caused by do on aquatic species the time series comparison of observed vs simulated do values indicates reasonable swat model performance for do in which the swat model captures the seasonal variability of do like higher autumn do concentrations 5 mg l and lower summer and spring concentrations 5 mg l fig 3 as observed from the figs 2 and 3 the concentration of do dropped quite significantly during summer and spring months the pattern of measured do has been improved represented by the simulated results of the new swat model the concentration of do in stream will alter the spatiotemporal distribution of aquatic species in the arb spatially in most stations concentration of do shown in fig 3 is decreasing temporally during summer season stream temperature will obviously increase and consequently the concentration of do decreasing compared to other seasons the decreasing do concentration will affect aquatic species in different aspects as indicated by caissie et al 2007 aquatic species generally has a specific range of do that they can tolerate and any changes in stream do concentration may have any adverse effect on the overall habitats predominantly if the average do concentration in stream exceeds do threshold various habitats e g fish in water bodies expected to either migrate or die at the worst case null et al 2013 therefore decrease of the stream do concentration in the arb particularly such noticeable decrease in summer season would have adverse effect on the cold water fish species in colder snow covered conditions like arb simulated do indicates relatively diurnal constancy due to lower metabolism at lower water temperatures lower bacterial activity and restricted reaeration intern affects the decay of organic matter and nitrification inline with kwak et al 2017 and du et al 2019c potential decreases in stream do concentration during summer season would have adverse effect on the fish species the favoured do concentration ranges and the upper fish tolerance do for the three main fish species such as walleye northern pike and salmon in the arb were shown in table 4 because of low do in freshwater aquatic systems particularly during summer season is important in the bottom water layers of stratified water columns which is important to evaluate the effect of low do changes in the fish community structure caused by low level of do are increasingly likely justus et al 2014 lower level of do concentrations caused lethal and sublethal behavioural and physiological effects on various organisms in general and fish in particular the concentrations decrease below the thresholds i e 5 gm l the species richness will decrease as the acute lethal thresholds for individual species are surpassed to understand the potential effect on the three main fish species we obtained the number of days within favoured do ranges and the exceeding upper tolerance dos during the peak season table 4 and figs 2 and 3 lower concentrations of do in mg l creates hypoxic conditions for aquatic ecosystems particularly for fish species in line with magoulick and kobza 2003 fish species may tolerate short term exposure to the hypoxia very few able to persist in minimal do concentrations the growth rates for the fish species listed in the table 4 are impaired at do concentrations below 5 mg l the overall growth rate is reduced up to 22 when the concentrations are lower than 6 mg l and fish mortality happens at 3 mg l carter 2005 the thresholds for this study assume moderate loss begins at 6 mg l and severe loss occurs at the concentrations of do below 5 mg l decrease in do concentration due to increasing in stream temperature will result in decreasing the water quality ficklin et al 2013 and this is true in the arb furthermore the lower do concentration particularly during summer season fig 3 would specify that decrease in the concentration of do would be worse the results indicated that in most of the basins in the arb the concentration of do is decreasing in order to maintain the life of aquatic ecosystems the availability of enough do is important and therefore decrease in concentration would have negative influence on the aquatic species survival in addition to water quality 3 7 water quality concentration for aquatic ecosystems the wqi calculated using various aspects of water quality using equation and the scores shown in table 1 indicates that water quality of arb rated between fair to excellent in all stations for do concentration during in autumn and winter however the concentrations were found to be poor at ab07dd0010 ab07ad0100 and ab07dd0105 during the summer season the water quality impairments tend to increase in the downstream reaches of the river basin the cwqi suggests that a spatial improvement in the water quality has been observed based on the do concentrations except for summer and spring seasons as indicated in table 5 in line with our study the impairments of water quality prominently are from the contribution of agricultural practices and the decrease in do concentration is as result of increase in stream temperature shrestha and wang 2018 the decrease in concentration of do in space and time were indicated by fig 3 deficiency of do causes asphyxiation and distract the survival of fish spices in the river basin which will cause migration during the critical periods and to the worst case they will die similarly doc concentrations of arb were varied in distribution and reduced in concentration level table 5 and fig 4 in which the seasonal doc distribution vary between 0 65 mg l and 10 mg l however the doc concentrations in most monitoring sites decreased below the required level 5 mg l lower level of doc below the required level causes for impairment of drinking water quality and aquatic ecosystem survival as can be shown in table 5 and fig 5 higher fc concentrations in all stations during summer and spring which causes for reducing the health of water quality considering the concentration of fc it exceeds the water quality standards allowed the overall quality of water in the arb is a result of various diffused sources of pollution for all the parameters which were addressed in our study as per water quality standards which was established by the council of directive 75 440 eec 1975 even though the concentrations of fc are under the range of required level it has been higher in some of the observed stations such as summer spring and autumn of the arb the concentrations of fc simulated profiles are associated to the input from bacteria indicator which is related to accumulation of pollution from various sources such as livestock and piggeries farms 4 conclusions we developed processed based integrated algorithms linking do doc and fc with aquatic ecosystem and water quality within the swat model the model was tested using monitoring data of do doc and fc from 2010 to 2017 in the athabasca river basin the results show that the extended swat model was able to capture the processes at the watershed scale the simulation results also indicate that modified swat model achieved satisfactory to very good performances for all stations at daily time scale however during validation the simulation performance showed conflicting results particularly the value of pbias at the stations ab07dd0010 and ab07ad0100 shows negative values it is found that there is highly seasonal do variation in the athabasca river basin the substantial changes in water quality are therefore less suitable for aquatic ecosystems survival these changes seem to be especially sensitive to the summer and spring and parts of snow covered winter seasons the concentrations of do revealed a distinct temporal pattern with the lowest decrease below the 5 mg l do levels in order to maintain the aquatic life during spring and summer seasons and even at some points drop as low as 2 4 mg l during the summer months such decreasing do concentrations would affect the dynamics of water quality in the arb particularly the marked decreases predicted in some seasons in all the monitoring stations summer winter and some other snow covered seasons would possibly affect the aquatic species especially fishes in the abr likewise doc concentrations dropdown to 0 65 mg l during autumn 0 71 mg l for winter 0 86 mg l for summer and 1 mg l for spring which is by far lower 5 mg l than the required level for water quality the decreases in concentration of do resulted mainly from the rise in water temperature and decrease in volume of stream flow leading to decreasing the saturation as well as the carrying capacity for do concurrent with do and doc concentrations the concentration of fc revealed a substantial increase the results of this study revealed that the marked decrease in spatial concentrations of do was lower than the minimal tolerance do of some fishes this implied more potential threat for the main fish species northern pick walleye and salmon fish in the arb therefore it is of vital importance to

5409,dongting lake wetland serves critical ecosystem function for water regulation and biodiversity protection yet it is vulnerable to hydrologic cycle variation caused by anthropogenic activities and climate change the impoundment of three gorges dam tgd has influenced hydrological environment and land cover changes in the wetland to quantify these influences long term land cover variations in the wetland were investigate by applying the support vector machine method to landsat satellite observations 1978 2018 we also try to explore the driving factors of vegetation changes by combining the classification results with measured hydrological and meteorological data some significant results have been revealed as follows 1 in dry seasons the most significant changes in dongting lake wetland were the vegetation expansion and the water area shrinkage especially during the pre tgd period before 2003 specifically the vegetation area increased at a rate of 44 22 km2 a and the water decreased at a rate of 37 23 km2 a for the period of 1979 2001 but the variation trends of wetland cover types changed after 2003 the vegetation decreased at a rate of 24 36 km2 a and water increased at a rate of 20 05 km2 a from 2003 to 2017 2 in wet seasons vegetation 1433 58 603 48 km2 and water area 2153 32 603 98 km2 fluctuated greatly in the pre tgd period and the variation range narrowed significantly after 2003 1632 62 234 39 km2 of vegetation 1958 5 235 04 km2 of water 3 before 2003 the long term change of vegetation area in dry seasons of the dongting lake wetland was strongly linear correlated with inundation area r 0 88 p 0 05 sediment deposition r 0 84 p 0 05 and mean temperature between july and september r 0 79 p 0 05 but these relationships have changed after the operation of the tgd in all the variation in hydrological conditions caused by the impoundment of the tgd was likely the main reason for the variation of dongting lake wetland in recent decades keywords dongting lake three gorges dam land cover wetland vegetation landsat observations 1 introduction wetlands are lands that are permanently seasonally or occasionally covered by shallow water whether natural or artificial and water is the primary factor controlling the environment in these areas bragg 2002 cowardin et al 1979 guo et al 2017 as one of the most important living environment on earth the wetland play a critical role in biodiversity protection carbon storage flood control and water supply mitsch and gosselink 2000 ozesmi and bauer 2002 however due to intensive anthropogenic activities and climate change wetland systems have been greatly damaged in recent decades leading to numerous social and ecological problems such as biodiversity reductions and heavy metal pollution li et al 2013 wu et al 2019 to prevent further destruction of wetlands and conserve existing wetland systems it is important to monitor and understand wetland changes in regional and global scales han et al 2015 land cover change in terrestrial surface is one of the major research hotspots in earth systems with profound implications for natural ecosystems and human society turner et al 2007 wetlands are vulnerable and sensitive to environment variation and have become key regions for monitoring land cover change land cover change reveals the spatial distribution characteristics of wetland surface cover and the complexity of its spatial temporal variation which is helpful for understanding the interactions between wetland ecosystems and the physical environment including hydrology meteorology and topography dronova et al 2011 the spatial temporal variations of different wetlands are driven by different factors such as wildlife grazing mitchell and perrow 1998 seasonal flood cycles miller and fujii 2010 and human reclamation zhao and fang 2004 and these variations greatly affect ecosystem functioning and natural resources monitoring long term land cover changes may be challenging due to the limited monitoring points in large scale inundation areas complexity of cover types and rapid variations in hydrological conditions dronova et al 2011 remote sensing provides valuable multi temporal observation data that can be used to investigate large wetland variation in addition remote sensing is especially useful in rapidly changing areas since retrospective and consistent synoptic coverage from satellites hu et al 2015a b huang et al 2012 olofsson et al 2014 yuan et al 2005 furthermore time series observations of hydrological stations have been widely used to identify changes in hydrological environments with advantages of high accuracy and real time observations han et al 2016 xu and milliman 2009 dongting lake is a typical river connecting lake that interacts with the yangtze river huang et al 2012 li et al 2013 and its exposed bottomlands from october to march is one of the most critical wetlands in the world in recent years the dongting wetland was reported to be destroyed due to intensive human activities and change of hydrological regime the operation of the three gorges dam tgd was considered as the main trigger for wetland changes in the downstream of yangtze river feng et al 2016 numerous studies have demonstrated that the hydrological environment of dongting lake has changed after the operation of the tgd e g variations in water surface and sediment deposition huang et al 2012 li et al 2009 peng et al 2005 flood and sediment diversion changes of the jingjiang river chang et al 2010 xia et al 2016 and evolution of chenglingji water level and flow of dongting lake han et al 2016 yuan et al 2015 there has been a large amount of literature involving wetland changes in dongting lake however previous researchers have focused mainly on changes in inundation area zhao et al 2005 and flood hazards huang et al 2012 wang et al 2011 and the long term changes in land cover types in the dongting lake wetland have received limited attention the fluctuation in hydrological elements is the major factor influencing wetland changes especially for vegetation wang et al 2014 wilcox 2004 xie et al 2014 described the vegetation variations from 1995 to 2011 of east dongting lake using landsat observations which observed that vegetation colonized the non vegetation areas more quickly after 2003 based on modis products between 2000 and 2012 wu et al 2017 monitored the wetland vegetation patterns of dongting lake and the poyang lake response to water level changes resulting from the tgd zhao and fang 2004 characterized the long term 1930s 1998 land cover changes in dongting lake area by digitalizing historical topographical maps for the 1930 s and 1950 s and interpreting the landsat images for 1978 1989 and 1998 the results showed that the land cover change in dongting area was divided into two distinct periods impoldering 1930s 1978 and lake restoration 1978 1998 after the end of the 1970s the ecological environment of dongting lake recovered under the conditions of the lake restoration policy zhao and fang 2004 however the operation of tgd again has a large impact on the land cover of dongting lake the temporal or spatial scale of previous studies has been limited and the wetland cover change in dongting lake during the pre and post tgd period has not been systematically monitored thus it is necessary to systematically investigate the long term wetland cover variation in dongting lake in this study the long term land cover variation in dongting lake wetland based on landsat observations was systematically studied with the following two objectives 1 to document the spatial temporal variation of major wetland features of dongting lake in dry and wet seasons from 1978 to 2018 2 to reveal the hydrological and meteorological driving factors of the long term variations of wetland changes during the pre and post tgd period 2 study area and dataset 2 1 study area dongting lake 28 42 29 32 n 112 06 113 09 e the second largest freshwater lake in china locates on the south bank of the middle yangtze river fig 1 it consists of three major sections i e east west and south dongting lake deng et al 2014 lai et al 2013 the lake is fed by seven water inlets including four tributaries xiangjiang zishui yuanjiang and lishui and three outlets ouchi songzi taiping of the yangtze river fig 1 xie et al 2014 the water of the entire lake finally discharges into the yangtze river via the chenglingji hydrological station lai et al 2013 the annual average air temperature is 16 8 c and the monthly average temperature ranges from 4 11 to 29 c hu et al 2015a b the dongting lake wetland is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate which results in considerable seasonal variability in precipitation chen et al 2015 april to september is defined as the wet season with precipitation accounting for more than 60 of the total annual precipitation and the inundation area could be more than 2500 km2 deng et al 2014 october to march of the year is defined as the dry season and the inundation area is typically 500 km2 due to the reduced rainfall deng et al 2014 lai et al 2013 furthermore most of the lake bottomlands are exposed and serve as habitats for migratory birds as the water level declines during the dry seasons zou et al 2019 three national nature reserves have been established in the dongting lake to protect the endangered migratory birds the south dongting lake national nature reserve sdlnnr 905 02 km2 one of the largest freshwater wetlands in southern china has drawn special attention in terms of land cover characteristics variation wang et al 2006 in addition the dongting lake wetland boundary used in this study is defined as the maximum inundation area in 1996 during the wet seasons tgd the world s largest hydroelectric dam located on the upper middle mainstream of the yangtze river mainly serving for flood control power generation and navigation graf 1999 tang et al 2016 wu et al 2019 the tgd stored water to 135 m and entered the cofferdam power generation period in june 2003 in a typical annual cycle the tgd regulated yangtze outflow based on four water dispatch schemes specifically 1 flood pre discharged control the water level of the tgd was required to be lowered to 145 m in june 2 flood regulation the outflow rate was adjusted to regulate the flood in the main flood period july early september 3 impoundment of the tgd the water level was stored to 175 m within a month after the flood season 4 water compensation tgd water release from january to march or from december to april in the next year ou et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 water dispatch schemes of tgd would be adjusted according to the specific conditions of each year if heavy rainfalls consecutively occurred the tgd would execute compensation operation to alleviate the flood control pressure of the dongting lake therefore the operation of tgd may lead to significant changes in the hydrological environment of dongting lake 2 2 dataset in this work four types data were used including long term remote sensing data digital elevation model dem data hydrological and meteorological data april is the dry wet transition month in the dongting lake wetland the year used in the present study is the hydrological year which starts on 1st april and ends on 31st march of the year costa and foley 1998 a key issue in monitoring long term changes of wetland is the selection of appropriate remote sensing data since 1972 landsat satellites have provided uninterrupted remote sensing observation of land surfaces with moderate spatial and spectral resolutions wright and gallant 2007 in this study long term remote sensing images collected by landsat instruments including mss tm etm and oli were collected from the united states geological survey usgs http www usgs gov after visual examination 30 cloud free images covering the dongting lake wetland over 40 years were selected table 1 although one image cannot cover the whole dongting lake wetland the dominant varied area including the south dongting lake and east dongting lake basically ensured image consistency the remaining area with a high terrain and small variation range was supplemented by images that are near in space and time the meteorological and hydrological stability of seasonal images in summer and winter are usually best for change detection applications xian et al 2009 thus remote sensing data in dry seasons were obtained in november january similarly the satellite images in the wet seasons from 1978 to 2018 were collected between july and september table 1 a 30 m spatial resolution dem of the dongting lake wetland in 2009 was collected from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn the dem data in 2009 could appropriately represent most of the bottom topography in dongting lake wetland from 1976 to 2018 the daily water level data of chenglingji station representing the water level of whole lake and nanju station representing the water level of sdlnnr from 1993 to 2018 were obtained from the hunan provincial water resources department http slt hunan gov cn fig 1 the daily water level data for each hydrological station were used to calculate the annual mean monthly hydrological data and annual duration days for high water level on this basis the hydrological environment variation in dongting lake wetland during pre and post tgd period were analyzed the annual records of sediment load in dongting lake including control station of seven main water inlets and chenglingji station between 1978 and 2017 were collected from the changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources of china http www cjw gov cn the air temperature and precipitation values used in this study were daily data from the china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc cma gov cn the four meteorological stations nanxian yueyang yuanjiang xiangyin station closest to the dongting lake were selected to represent the climate of the whole region fig 1 these auxiliary data were used to detect the alteration of hydrological and meteorological environment in whole region and to reveal the driving factors of long term land cover change in dongting lake wetland 3 methods 3 1 pre processing remote sensing images are distorted by sensor solar atmospheric and topographic effects thus pre processing was required to minimize these errors young et al 2017 pixel registration and radiometric calibration of multi temporal images were accomplished first the atmospheric corrections were also conducted through the fast line of sight atmospheric analysis of spectral hypercubes flaash atmospheric correction module which is considered a good atmospheric correction solution for terrestrial applications kaufman et al 1997 the key parameters are selected as follows mid latitude summer for the atmospheric model because the model whose standard column water vapor amount is similar to that of the study area rural for the aerosol model because aerosols in the study areas are not strongly affected by urban or industrial sources and 2 band k t for aerosol retrieval any other parameters were set by default to maintain a consistent spatial resolution among the remote sensing images the mss images were re sampled to 30 m using the nearest neighbor resampling method 3 2 landsat images normalization remote sensing images have been continuously provided by landsat satellites with the development of technology the spatial and spectral resolution of landsat sensors have been greatly improved the multiyear satellite images collected from different landsat instruments require radiometric correction the ideal solution is to use the absolute radiation correction method to remove pseudo change but it is necessary to collect a large number of real time parameters which is impossible for images acquired several decades ago this problem has led to the development of relative radiometric correction method the goal of relative radiometric normalization is to adjust the target image to its reference level to control and reduce the pseudo change of the surface condition xian et al 2009 among many relative correction approaches the linear regression normalization method has been proved to be an effective method schott et al 1988 yang and lo 2000 one basic premise behind this method is that the radiance reaching the satellite sensor in a given spectral channel can be expressed as a linear function of reflectivity schott et al 1988 thus the atmospheric and calibration differences between the subject image usually on a later date and reference image usually on an earlier date are linearly related yang and lo 2000 in this paper the landsat images for 2017 and 2018 as the latest image data were chosen as reference images for the dry and wet seasons respectively then dense woodland clear water and sand were selected as relatively stable pixels whose surface features can be considered unchanged during the 40 year study period han et al 2015 after a reference image was selected the radiometric characteristics of the subject images were adjusted to match the reference images through the linear regression normalization method therefore the surface radiation of all landsat images was basically consistent and the classification maps derived from the images were deemed to be comparable 3 3 training samples and method selection the dongting lake wetland is complicated and has various land cover types various types of land use and land cover classification systems have been proposed to meet different research purposes shalaby and tateishi 2007 yuan et al 2005 zurqani et al 2018 in this study the dongting lake wetland has been classified into four different types including water vegetation mudflat and sand and detailed functions of these types can be found at dronova et al 2011 han et al 2015 demonstrated that four types could be effectively distinguished in the visible to near infrared nir regions high resolution images can be collected from google earth for training samples selection and determination knorn et al 2009 the training samples within the dongting wetland boundary were acquired based on quickbird images from google earth to classify different land cover types various supervised classification methods e g parallelepiped minimum distance mahalanobis distance maximum likelihood and neural net have been used to produce land cover classification maps however most of the supervised classification schemes require a sufficiently large number of training samples and have some defects such as over learning dimension disasters and local minimums mountrakis et al 2011a b the support vector machine svm method is a group of supervised learning methods that can be applied for classification or regression and the method was proposed by cortes and vapnik 1995 svm performs better with a limited amount of reference data and effectively avoids some of the drawbacks of other methods which have been demonstrated by many researchers mountrakis et al 2011a b raghavendra and deka 2014 compared with maximum likelihood classifiers bhagawat et al 2019 recommended svm as a suitable option for precise classification of land cover thus the svm method was chosen for the dongting lake wetland classification in this study 3 4 classification and change detection before supervised classification a multi band attribute image is required containing the spectral bands of satellite images and other information to increase the accuracy of classification the green band red band nir band dem and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi were combined to create a multi band attribute image in this study the ndvi was derived from the red and nir ratio as follows ndvi λ nir λ r λ nir λ r where λnir is reflectance in the nir band 770 900 nm for landsat 5 and 7 and 850 880 nm for landsat 8 and λr is reflectance in the red spectral band 630 690 nm for landsat 5 and 7 and 640 670 nm for landsat 8 lai et al 2018 pan et al 2018 traditionally a classifier can only be used on the specific image containing the training samples and not on other images the new envi classification framework necf a powerful and flexible classification method is provided by envi 5 4 to conduct supervised classification based on an image a classifier can be created and trained through necf and then applied to other similar remote sensing images the classification results of dongting lake wetland were derived from the following steps 1 extract attributes from images different land cover attributes were extracted based on the training samples selected from google earth 2 shuffle and split samples the training samples were randomly scrambled and then divided into two parts 80 of the samples were used to train the svm classifier and the remaining 20 were used to assess the classification accuracy 3 iterative training the iterative trainer does not interfere with classifier evolution was used in conjunction with the svm classifier support self renewal to converge the error to a minimum through continuous iterations the key parameters used in iterative trainer was set as follows 100 for maximum iterations and 0 001 for convergence criterion 4 evaluate classifier and classify images a confusion matrix was generated using 20 samples and the classification accuracy assessment indices overall accuracy kappa coefficient omission and commission errors for each class were calculated to evaluate the accuracy of the classifier after the classifier was evaluated the classification results can be obtained by inputting multi band attribute images into the trained classifier following the classification of imagery a post classification change detection algorithm was used to quantitatively analyze the characteristics of surface changes from remote sensing data in different periods this is the most common change detection approach shalaby and tateishi 2007 the post classification approach provides from to information and the change type between two classification images of the same scene taken at different times yuan et al 2005 zurqani et al 2018 the approach was applied in four intervals 1979 2003 and 2003 2017 for the dry season 1981 2003 and 2003 2018 for the wet season and the change details of sdlnnr also enlarged the classification maps of 1978 1981 2017 and 2018 for two different seasons were selected because they are placed at the start and end of the observed period two other classification maps in 2003 were chosen because they are the closest years to the impoundment of the tgd to better understand the wetland vegetation changing trend the changing rate of ndvi was calculated in the dry and wet seasons respectively the changing rate was obtained by linear regression based on the ndvi value of the selected image and its collection time 4 results and discussion 4 1 long term wetland changes in dry seasons during dry seasons the vegetation continuously expanded eastward and southward and linearly increased from 2355 55 km2 to 2534 51 km2 in 1979 2017 figs 2 a and 3 a which was the most notable change during the entire study period the change trend of vegetation in donting lake was divided into two different stages one of which increased at a rate of 44 22 km2 a from 1979 to 2001 and the other one decreased at a rate of 24 36 km2 a from 2003 to 2017 consistent with hu et al 2015a b the water area in dongting lake wetland dramatically decreased from 2000 to 2012 in this study the water area in dongting lake shrank towards the center of the lake declining from the original 941 79 km2 in 1978 to 729 87 km2 in 2018 fig 3a the change trend of water in dongting lake was also divided into two different stages of which it decreased at a rate of 37 23 km2 a p 0 05 for the period of 1979 2001 and increased at a rate of 20 05 km2 a p 0 05 from 2003 to 2017 during 1979 2017 the vegetation and water area of the sdlnnr presented expanding and shrinking trends respectively but the changing rate slowed after 2003 the vegetation of the sdlnnr increased at a rate of 4 17 km2 a and 1 08 km2 a in the pre and post tgd periods respectively the water area of the sdlnnr decreased at a rate of 5 26 km2 a and 0 46 km2 a in the pre and post tgd periods figs 2b and 3b respectively the variation of mudflat and sand areas of the sdlnnr was similar to that of the entire lake and showed a fluctuating downward trend as shown in fig 4 the mutual conversion of vegetation water mudflat and sand was intense and concentrated at the junction of land and water after 2003 the transition area narrowed remarkably the transition area accounted for 19 56 and 14 07 of dongting lake wetland in the pre and post tgd periods respectively among the various types of transitions the most prominent change was that the mudflat 150 04 km2 and water 254 47 km2 changed to vegetation during the pre tgd period and the vegetation 237 21 km2 changed to mudflat and water in the post tgd period table 2 the expansion of vegetation during the pre tgd period was mainly from the water and mudflat area in south dongting lake and east dongting lake fig 4a after 2003 these transitions significantly decreased and the major transition was replaced by the transition from vegetation to water 132 94 km2 and mudflat 104 27 km2 which resulted in declined vegetation and increased water during the post tgd the submergence conditions changed although the land cover change of dongting lake during the entire study period was complicated the increase in vegetation was unquestionable as shown in fig 5 a except for the vegetation growth that was inhibited in the southern part of east dongting lake the entire map was dominated by a greenish color which indicated that the vegetation was prosperous during the study period in addition the vegetation of the sdlnnr experienced dramatic expansion during the 40 year period the ndvi values presented insignificant changes in the offshore regions indicating that the vegetation cover has been stable for many years 4 2 influence of the tgd on vegetation area in dry seasons the amount of water entering dongting lake decreased seasonally due to the operation of the tgd and the corresponding water level also declined seasonally hu et al 2015a b xie et al 2014 in addition to the limited increased in february and june the climatological monthly mean water level of the chenglingji station had decreased compared with pre tgd period fig 7 a and table 4 the reduction of water level from july to october was prominent with a value greater than 1 4 m these seasonal fluctuations of water level were closely related to the dispatch scheme which released water from february and regulated floodwater from july to september during the post tgd period the duration days of high water level also decreased and the most significant change occurred in the range of 30 32 m fig 7c and table 3 which could attribute to the water impoundment during the fall seasons the change in water level and duration days directly affected the submerged conditions of dongting lake which had a great impact on vegetation growth xie et al 2014 strong negative correlation r 0 88 p 0 05 was revealed between the vegetation area and the inundation area during the pre tgd period but this correlation weakened after 2003 fig 6a during the impoundment periods of tgd the water area decreased and the lake bottom exposure time increased wu et al 2017 which changed the hydrological conditions based on different topographies the increased exposure time of lake bottom promoted the growth of vegetation distributed at the junction of land and water figs 4 and 5a however the increased exposure time led to enhanced evaporation and reduced soil moisture in some areas that were infrequently submerged far from lake center with higher elevation feng et al 2016 moeslund et al 2013 the growth of vegetation in these areas was restricted which was revealed by the transition maps and the ndvi changing rate maps figs 4 and 5a furthermore the bottom topography of the lake was significantly influenced by the deposition of sediment dongting lake received water and sediment from four tributaries and three outlets of the yangtze river fig 1 a series of human activities such as the closing of the tiaoxuan outlets the cut straight of jingjiang and the operation of gezhou dam and the tgd greatly influenced the inflow and sediment situation of dongting lake li et al 2009 xia et al 2016 but the operation of tgd has different effects on sediment and runoff the input annual amount of water and sediment to the dongting lake approximately reduced 11 67 and 83 99 after 2003 fig 7d and e the impact of sediment deposition changes on the vegetation deserved attention according to xie and chen 2008 the speed and mode of sedimentation determined the evolution trend and direction of wetland vegetation fig 6c shows the relationship between the classified vegetation area of the dongting lake wetland and sediment deposition which is defined as the difference between the sediment flow into and out of dongting lake during the pre tgd period a strong correlation r 0 84 p 0 05 was found between vegetation and deposition indicating that vegetation expansion was remarkably affected by sediment deposition before 2003 heavy sediment deposition accelerated the expansion of the shoal to promote the growth of terrestrial vegetation jing et al 2017 and increased the turbidity of the water body to inhibit the growth of aquatic plants however the operation of tgd alleviated sediment deposition and led to a change in the dynamic balance between sediment input and output hu et al 2015a b xu and milliman 2009 as shown in fig 7d a historic change occurred in that the sediment output of the lake exceeded the deposition in 2003 and a negative value of deposition first occurred in 2010 indicating that dongting lake changed from trapping to supplying sediment to the yangtze river in addition according to the previous studies the change of sediment conditions in dongting area includes volume and component yang et al 2017 these changes not only affect the terrain of dongting lake area but also complicate the water turbidity of dongting lake li et al 2009 the reduced sediment amount and coarse sand particles directly reduced the turbidity of water and enhanced light transmittance which affected vegetation growth and species distributions sheridan et al 1998 after the deposition mode changed the plant community of the dongting lake wetland mainly succeeded in a slow manner xie and chen 2008 and other factors gradually increased the impact on vegetation expansion the variation of meteorological elements was considered another prominent cause of vegetation area change over the past 40 years a consistent increase has been observed in air temperature xie et al 2017 while no significant trend was found in either inter annual or inter month changes in local precipitation fig 7b and table 4 according to jiang et al 2011 the precipitation and ndvi exhibited prominent correlation in the dongting lake wetland watershed region however the fluctuations of local precipitation measured at the nearest meteorological station of dongting lake did not have a significant impact on the vegetation variation therefore the growth of vegetation was closely related to the precipitation conditions of the entire dongting lake watershed region but was limited affected by local precipitation correlation analysis between the vegetation area and temperature revealed that the change in vegetation area in dry seasons was unlikely to be affected by the temperature near the time of data acquisition however the change was deeply affected by the mean temperature between july and september r 0 79 p 0 05 fig 6d the combination of high temperature and large inundation area was conducive to the expansion of vegetation during the pre tgd period the high water level inundation days reduced and the hydrothermal conditions in the dongting lake area also changed after 2003 sun et al 2012 which altered the relationship between vegetation area and temperature the flood regulation and water storage schemes of the tgd lowered the water level in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and prompted dongting lake to increase its output flow to compensate for the river fig 7a hu et al 2015a b the monthly mean water level of chenglingji station declined significantly from july to october and the duration days of the high water level decreased remarkably which led to the reduced water area and the increased lake bottomland exposure time the changes in vegetation species and distribution occurred due to the extended exposure time of the lake bottomland which affected the ndvi value in the dongting lake wetland furthermore the decrease in soil moisture as shown by the decline in the water level led to the inhibition of vegetation growth especially in the region away from the lake center meanwhile the decrease of the high water level duration and the reduction of sediment amount and coarse sand particles enhanced light transmittance which was beneficial to the photosynthesis of the lake bottom plants and promoted the growth of vegetation sheridan et al 1998 interestingly the relationship between vegetation area and mean temperature between july and september changed after 2003 which was attributed to the inhibition of vegetation growth with increasing evaporation and decreasing soil moisture 4 3 long term wetland changes in wet seasons and influence of the tgd during the wet seasons the vegetation and water area fluctuated greatly before 2003 and the fluctuated range significantly narrowed during the post tgd period figs 3c and 8 a specifically vegetation increased from 1433 58 603 48 km2 to 1632 62 234 39 km2 in the entire lake fig 3c compared with the large fluctuation range during pre tgd periods the initially operation of tgd has already affected the inundation area of dongting lake wetland since 2003 fig 3c however the vegetation area of sdlnnr in 2003 was inconsistent with the long term change trend of vegetation during the post tgd period fig 3c this means that the impact of tgd on land cover in dongting lake wetland is on a short time scale and the vegetation has not adapted to the variation of hydrological regime during the study period the expansion of vegetation mainly occurred along the west bank of east dongting lake and south dongting lake and in the northern part of west dongting lake fig 8a yan et al 2017 in contrast the water body showed a decreasing trend and fluctuated range was significantly narrowed after 2003 fig 8a this was attributed to the dispatch scheme of tgd which aims to alleviated flood water pressure of downstream during wet seasons the distribution of the rapid inter conversion between vegetation and water was also shown in the transition map fig 9 and table 5 and the main change between 2003 and 2018 was the transition from water to vegetation fig 9c accounting for 91 95 of the change area which was concentrated in the sdlnnr fig 9d the change in the sdlnnr was similar and more significant to that of the whole lake with vegetation increasing from 22 26 km2 to 66 52 km2 and water decreasing from 83 64 km2 to 39 32 km2 in the entire sdlnnr during 1978 2018 the changes in ndvi were roughly divided into two parts during the wet seasons fig 5b the western region of the entire map presented a greenish color indicating that the vegetation flourished and the remainder of the map presented the opposite situation moreover datong lake where the change was not remarkable using other analyses methods also showed positive values in the ndvi change rate map during the wet seasons especially in the northeast corner fig 5c the results indicated that the vegetation area of dongting lake wetland experienced fluctuated expansion and that the submergence conditions changed during wet seasons to test whether the land cover change of the dongting lake wetland was driven by the operation of the tgd the relationship between the vegetation area of the sdlnnr and the 30 day mean water level before the image acquisition date of nanju station was analyzed fig 6b a correlation r 0 75 p 0 05 was revealed in the entire study period a significant negative correlation was found with a coefficient r of 0 91 p 0 05 in the period of 1994 2001 the vegetation growth was greatly affected by the frequency timing and duration of the water level fluctuations hu et al 2015a b but the hydrological environment of dongting lake changed after 2003 during the pre tgd period the three outlets undertaken a large amount of water and sediment from the yangtze river which promoted the vegetation growth of the sdlnnr after 2003 the runoff and sediment flow into dongting lake dramatic declined li et al 2009 the difference between the mean water level of the pre and post tgd periods in nanju station ranged from 1 2 to 0 9 m during july october fig 7a and table 4 which was attributed to the flood regulation and water storage schemes the duration days of high water level also declined during the post tgd period which enhanced light transmittance and facilitated the photosynthesis of the lake bottom plants feng et al 2016 4 4 potential effects of other factors to understand the potential factors that lead to the change in classified wetland vegetation the correlations between other meteorological factors and vegetation were examined most of the relationships were statistically insignificant although high wind speed could stir the lake water in a short period thus changing turbidity it appears to be smeared in the calculation of monthly mean statistics hou et al 2017 dongting basin was shaped by tectonic movement but the formation and change of dongting lake were closely related to the roles of rivers and human activities su et al 2001 at the beginning of the quaternary dongting basin was affected by neotectonic movement and the peripheral mountain increased intermittently at the same time the lake basin declined by the late pleistocene the tectonic activity almost stopped forming the prototype of dongting lake basin since the holocene natural evolution has been relatively stable and human activities have strengthened su et al 2001 since 1949 increasing population and economic development have led to the intensive reclamation of the dongting lake wetland however several ecological restoration projects have been conducted by the chinese government since 1978 and the environment of dongting lake has gradually recovered with the reduction of human activities thus the tectonic movement and reclamation activities were not considered as the main reasons for the land cover changes of the dongting lake wetland the poplar plantation history has been going on for more than 40 years in dongting lake wetland which may also affect the long term change of vegetation area jing et al 2016 li et al 2015 because poplar cultivation can alleviate the tight supply of paper materials and promote the development of a local economy li et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 from introduced poplar in the 1970s to large scale planting in the late 1990s the poplar plantation areas increased 9 fold from 1978 to 2002 in dongting lake wetland jing et al 2016 according to yu et al 2019 although the poplar planting squeezed the living space of phragmite the total area of poplars and phragmite increased 50 from 1978 to 2002 which was consistent with the remotely sensed results in this study and was revealed in the transition maps fig 4 then the total areas of poplar and phragmite were basically unchanged from 2002 to 2014 yu et al 2019 however the accumulation of excessive poplar plantations has caused serious ecological degradation of the dongting lake wetland ecosystem xie et al 2007 since 2014 the local government implemented the return forest to wetland project to protect the health of the ecosystem this policy remarkably reduced the poplar area and effectively restored the growth space of phragmite and lake weed jing et al 2016 since the transition was occurred among different vegetation types the total vegetation area did not change significantly yu et al 2019 however compared with poplar the growth of phragmite was more easily influenced by the variation of hydrological environment which means that the impoundment of tgd may have a greater impact on vegetation area of dongting lake wetland in the future hence the cultivation of poplar and phragmite is a significant driving factors in the long term change of vegetation area especially during the pre tgd period dongting lake serves as an important habitat on the migratory line of east asia australian migratory birds zou et al 2019 the wetland vegetation might be affected by migratory bird over grazing resulting in a decrease of the ndvi values however this possibility was easily eliminated because the vegetation area of sdlnnr as one of the major habitats for migratory birds has shown an expanding trend during the study period meanwhile the variation in vegetation influenced the quantities of migratory birds that feed on vegetation the expansion of vegetation provided an appropriate living environment and adequate food sources for wetland migratory birds and was positively correlated with the quantity of wetland migratory birds zhang et al 2016 the remote sensing results of the vegetation area of sdlnnr presented an expanding trend which was consistent with the results by xiang et al 2017 who showed that the number of birds in east dongting lake during winter fluctuated upwardly from 2006 to 2013 the decline in water level affected the survival of aquatic animals and plants and may have reduced the number of birds that prey on fish correlation analysis showed that the water level and vegetation area of dongting lake were negatively correlated in this study which was consistent with the results of wu et al 2017 thus the land cover variation might change the proportion of migratory bird species of different diets in the dongting lake wetland in addition to the construction of tgd the land cover variation of the dongting lake wetland was inevitably affected by other aspects of human activities and natural environmental changes however due to the difficulty of obtaining data these aspects could only be speculated in previous research and their specific impacts on the dongting lake wetland require further confirmation 4 5 validity and defects of the observations when monitoring a region data with a higher temporal resolution should be selected for continuous monitoring throughout the year considering spatial resolution and long term data records landsat images seem to provide the most suitable dataset for research needs according to the study of han et al 2015 the four cover types of dongting lake wetland were demonstrated to be distinguishable in the visible to nir regions which ensured the accuracy of the classification results to some extent in addition considering that the dongting lake area is dominated by a subtropical monsoon climate the data selected in summer and winter are suitable for studying long term trends xian et al 2009 taking the dry season as an example the difference between the classified vegetation and water areas from two consecutive images in 2013 39 days apart was 1 01 and 1 49 fig 10 respectively similar results were observed from other pairs of images not shown here during dry seasons indicating that the vegetation and water areas were relatively stable in a short period 1 2 months the uncertainties caused by image timing should be smaller compared with these by long term interannual changes thus the current dataset was the optimal choice for monitoring the long term changes of dongting lake wetland the remote sensing images used in this paper involved data from four landsat instruments and the total signal acquired by each sensor includes the radiance from both the target and the noise in the transmission young et al 2017 the flaash atmospheric correction methods were used to remove some of the noise from transmission kaufman et al 1997 the linear regression normalization method was then used to ensure that the surface radiation of all landsat images was basically consistent yang and lo 2000 although each sensor had different band settings three green red and nir information rich and wavelength matched bands were included in all sensors the dem and ndvi data were combined with three bands to compose multi band attribute datasets as the base map for the classification then the multi band attribute datasets were inputted in necf to classify four decades of landsat imagery which greatly reduced the workload and maintained the consistency of the results subsequently the classification validation process was conducted in addition to the 20 samples for accuracy verification in the annual classification the 30 samples were taken to check the classification results of 1998 and 2016 in both dry and wet seasons with an accuracy of over 88 therefore the uncertainties of the remote sensing images had a slight effect on the accuracy of the classification results the accuracy of the classification results could meet the needs of the research the overall accuracies and kappa coefficient of all the results were higher than 83 and 0 79 respectively in this study some defects also existed firstly although the 30 m dem data acquired in 2009 could represent most of the bottom topography from 1978 to 2018 some lake segments remarkably affected by sediment deposition cannot be properly represented by it which caused minor errors in the classification results after supervised classification a visual post processing was conducted to remove potential classification errors to ensure the accuracy of the results secondly the water level data of chenglingji and nanju stations could only be acquired since 1993 which caused the analysis to be insufficient during the pre tgd period thirdly the precipitation data of the whole dongting drainage basin could be collected to further analyze the changes in the dongting lake wetland in addition other possible human activities such as illegal sand dredging and adjusting channel structures might have an impact on the dongting lake wetland zheng et al 2015 zheng et al 2016 but this study did not involve the analysis of these factors due to the difficulty in obtaining data it is necessary to continuously monitor and conduct further research on the land cover changes and driving factors of the dongting lake wetland 5 conclusions this study monitored the land cover variations in the dongting lake wetland in last four decades and revealed the following valuable findings 1 in dry seasons the vegetation area in dongting lake increased at a rate of 44 22 km2 a p 0 05 and the water area in dongting lake decreased at a rate of 37 23 km2 a p 0 05 from 1979 to 2001 before 2003 the transition mainly concentrated at the junction of land and water and the major transition was water changed to vegetation after the operation of tgd the vegetation area in dongting lake decreased at a rate of 24 36 km2 a p 0 05 and the water area in dongting lake increased at a rate of 20 05 km2 a p 0 05 from 2003 to 2017 the transition zone was remarkably narrowed and the major transitions were replaced by the transition from vegetation to water and mudflat 2 in wet seasons vegetation 1433 58 603 48 km2 and water area 2153 32 603 98 km2 fluctuated greatly in the pre tgd period and the variation range significantly narrowed after 2003 1632 62 234 39 km2 of vegetation 1958 5 235 04 km2 of water 3 during the pre tgd period long term variation of the dongting lake wetland was affected by various factors including the water level the water inundation area the sedimentation and the mean temperature from july to september but the original driving mechanism and the hydrological environment in the dongting lake area changed after the impoundment of tgd which was likely the main cause of wetland changes in recent years the findings of this study were significant for understanding the impacts resulting from the tgd on dongting lake wetland and the future evolution of dongting lake moreover with droughts frequently occurring the water turbidity hydraulic gradient and other hydrological factors of dongting lake have also changed in recent years which might influence the vegetation types and water quality of the wetland system these subtle variation and deep driving factors are worth exploring further and the results of this study might provide baseline information for future research this study can also help the local government agencies make management decisions in the future by providing critical information and technical support such as whether another dam should be built in the lake to conserve water storage of dongting lake furthermore the method used in this study could be easily extended to other large research regions with infrequently topographical variation and

5409,dongting lake wetland serves critical ecosystem function for water regulation and biodiversity protection yet it is vulnerable to hydrologic cycle variation caused by anthropogenic activities and climate change the impoundment of three gorges dam tgd has influenced hydrological environment and land cover changes in the wetland to quantify these influences long term land cover variations in the wetland were investigate by applying the support vector machine method to landsat satellite observations 1978 2018 we also try to explore the driving factors of vegetation changes by combining the classification results with measured hydrological and meteorological data some significant results have been revealed as follows 1 in dry seasons the most significant changes in dongting lake wetland were the vegetation expansion and the water area shrinkage especially during the pre tgd period before 2003 specifically the vegetation area increased at a rate of 44 22 km2 a and the water decreased at a rate of 37 23 km2 a for the period of 1979 2001 but the variation trends of wetland cover types changed after 2003 the vegetation decreased at a rate of 24 36 km2 a and water increased at a rate of 20 05 km2 a from 2003 to 2017 2 in wet seasons vegetation 1433 58 603 48 km2 and water area 2153 32 603 98 km2 fluctuated greatly in the pre tgd period and the variation range narrowed significantly after 2003 1632 62 234 39 km2 of vegetation 1958 5 235 04 km2 of water 3 before 2003 the long term change of vegetation area in dry seasons of the dongting lake wetland was strongly linear correlated with inundation area r 0 88 p 0 05 sediment deposition r 0 84 p 0 05 and mean temperature between july and september r 0 79 p 0 05 but these relationships have changed after the operation of the tgd in all the variation in hydrological conditions caused by the impoundment of the tgd was likely the main reason for the variation of dongting lake wetland in recent decades keywords dongting lake three gorges dam land cover wetland vegetation landsat observations 1 introduction wetlands are lands that are permanently seasonally or occasionally covered by shallow water

and perrow 1998 seasonal flood cycles miller and fujii 2010 and human reclamation zhao and fang 2004 and these variations greatly affect ecosystem functioning and natural resources monitoring long term land cover changes may be challenging due to the limited monitoring points in large scale inundation areas complexity of cover types and rapid variations in hydrological conditions dronova et al 2011 remote sensing provides valuable multi temporal observation data that can be used to investigate large wetland variation in addition remote sensing is especially useful in rapidly changing areas since retrospective and consistent synoptic coverage from satellites hu et al 2015a b huang et al 2012 olofsson et al 2014 yuan et al 2005 furthermore time series observations of hydrological stations have been widely used to identify changes in hydrological environments with advantages of high accuracy and real time observations han et al 2016 xu and milliman 2009 dongting lake is a typical river connecting lake that interacts with the yangtze river huang et al 2012 li et al 2013 and its exposed bottomlands from october to march is one of the most critical wetlands in the world in recent years the dongting wetland was reported to be destroyed due to intensive human activities and change of hydrological regime the operation of the three gorges dam tgd was considered as the main trigger for wetland changes in the downstream of yangtze river feng et al 2016 numerous studies have demonstrated that the hydrological environment of dongting lake has changed after the operation of the tgd e g

evolution of chenglingji water level and flow of dongting lake han et al 2016 yuan et al 2015 there has been a large amount of literature involving wetland changes in dongting lake however previous researchers have focused mainly on changes in inundation area zhao et al 2005 and flood hazards huang et al 2012 wang et al 2011 and the long term changes in land cover types in the dongting lake wetland have received limited attention the fluctuation in hydrological elements is the major factor influencing wetland changes especially for vegetation wang et al 2014 wilcox 2004 xie et al 2014 described the vegetation variations from 1995 to 2011 of east dongting lake using landsat observations which observed that vegetation colonized the non vegetation areas more quickly after 2003 based on modis products between 2000 and 2012 wu et al 2017 monitored the wetland vegetation patterns of dongting lake and the poyang lake response to water level changes resulting from the tgd zhao and fang 2004 characterized the long term 1930s 1998 land cover changes in dongting lake area by digitalizing historical topographical maps for the 1930 s and 1950 s and interpreting the landsat images for 1978 1989 and 1998 the results showed that the land cover change in dongting area was divided into two distinct periods impoldering 1930s 1978 and lake restoration 1978 1998 after the end of the 1970s the ecological environment of dongting lake recovered under the conditions of the lake restoration policy zhao and fang 2004 however the operation of tgd again has a large impact on the land cover of dongting lake the temporal or spatial scale of previous studies has been limited and the wetland cover change in dongting lake during the pre and post tgd period has not been systematically monitored thus it is necessary to systematically investigate the long term wetland cover variation in dongting lake in this study the long term land cover variation in dongting lake wetland based on landsat observations was systematically studied with the following two objectives 1 to document the spatial temporal variation of major wetland features of dongting lake in dry and wet seasons from 1978 to 2018 2 to reveal the hydrological and meteorological driving factors of the long term variations of wetland changes during the pre and post tgd period 2 study area and dataset 2 1 study area

is 16 8 c and the monthly average temperature ranges from 4 11 to 29 c hu et al 2015a b the dongting lake wetland is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate which results in considerable seasonal variability in precipitation chen et al 2015 april to september is defined as the wet season with precipitation accounting for more than 60 of the total annual precipitation and the inundation area could be more than 2500 km2 deng et al 2014 october to march of the year is defined as the dry season and the inundation area is typically 500 km2 due to the reduced rainfall deng et al 2014 lai et al 2013 furthermore most of the lake bottomlands are exposed and serve as habitats for migratory birds as the water level declines during the dry seasons zou et al 2019 three national nature reserves have been established in the dongting lake to protect the endangered migratory birds the south dongting lake national nature reserve sdlnnr 905 02 km2 one of the largest freshwater wetlands in southern china has drawn special attention in terms of land cover characteristics variation wang et al 2006 in addition the dongting lake wetland boundary used in this study is defined as

generation and navigation graf 1999 tang et al 2016 wu et al 2019 the tgd stored water to 135 m and entered the cofferdam power generation period in june 2003 in a typical annual cycle the tgd regulated yangtze outflow based on four water dispatch schemes specifically 1 flood pre discharged control the water level of the tgd was required to be lowered to 145 m in june 2 flood regulation the outflow rate was adjusted to regulate the flood in the main flood period july early september 3 impoundment of the tgd the water level was stored to 175 m within a month after the flood season 4 water

conditions of each year if heavy rainfalls consecutively occurred the tgd would execute compensation operation to alleviate the flood control pressure of the dongting lake therefore the operation of tgd may lead to significant changes in the hydrological environment of dongting lake 2 2 dataset in this work four types data were used including long term remote sensing data digital elevation model dem data hydrological and meteorological data april is the dry wet transition month in the dongting lake wetland the year used in the present study is the hydrological year which starts on 1st april and ends on 31st march of the year costa and foley 1998 a key issue in monitoring long term changes of wetland is the selection of appropriate remote sensing data since 1972 landsat satellites have provided uninterrupted remote sensing observation of land surfaces with moderate spatial and spectral resolutions wright and gallant 2007 in this study long term remote sensing images collected by landsat instruments including mss tm etm and oli were collected from the united states geological survey usgs http www usgs gov after visual examination 30 cloud free images covering the dongting lake wetland over 40 years were selected table 1 although one image cannot cover the whole dongting lake wetland the dominant varied area including the south dongting lake and east dongting lake basically ensured image consistency the remaining area with a high terrain and small variation range was supplemented by images that are near in space and time the meteorological and hydrological stability of seasonal images in summer and winter are usually best for change detection applications xian et al 2009 thus remote sensing data in dry seasons were obtained in november january similarly the satellite images in the wet seasons from 1978 to 2018 were collected between july and september table 1 a 30 m spatial resolution dem of the dongting lake wetland in 2009 was collected from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn the dem data in 2009 could appropriately represent most of the bottom topography in dongting lake wetland from 1976 to 2018 the daily water level data of chenglingji station representing the water level of whole lake and nanju station representing the water level of sdlnnr from 1993 to 2018 were obtained from the hunan provincial water resources department http slt hunan gov cn fig 1 the daily water level data for each hydrological station were used to calculate the annual mean monthly hydrological data and annual duration days for high water level on this basis the hydrological environment variation in dongting lake wetland during pre and post tgd period were analyzed the annual records of sediment load in dongting lake including control station of seven main water inlets and chenglingji station between 1978 and 2017 were collected from the changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources of china http www cjw

nanxian yueyang yuanjiang xiangyin station closest to the dongting lake were selected to represent the climate of the whole region fig 1 these auxiliary data were used to detect the alteration of hydrological and meteorological environment in whole region and to reveal the driving factors of long term land cover change in dongting lake wetland 3 methods 3 1 pre processing remote sensing images are distorted by sensor solar atmospheric and topographic effects thus pre processing was required to minimize these errors young et al 2017 pixel registration and radiometric calibration of multi temporal images were accomplished first the atmospheric corrections were also conducted through the fast line of sight atmospheric analysis of spectral hypercubes flaash atmospheric correction module which is considered a good atmospheric correction solution for terrestrial applications kaufman et al 1997 the key parameters are selected as follows mid latitude summer for the atmospheric model because the model whose standard column water vapor amount is similar to that of the study area rural for the aerosol model because aerosols in the study areas are not strongly affected by urban or industrial sources and 2 band k t for aerosol retrieval any other parameters were set by default to maintain a consistent spatial resolution among the remote sensing images the mss images were re sampled to 30 m using the nearest neighbor resampling method 3 2 landsat images normalization remote sensing images have been continuously provided by landsat satellites with the development of technology the spatial and spectral resolution of landsat sensors have been greatly improved the multiyear satellite images collected from different landsat instruments require radiometric correction the ideal solution is to use the absolute radiation correction method to remove pseudo change but it is necessary to collect a large number of real time parameters which is impossible for images acquired several decades ago this problem has led to the development of relative radiometric correction method the goal of relative radiometric normalization is to adjust the target image to its reference level to control and reduce the pseudo change of the surface condition xian et al 2009 among many relative correction approaches the linear regression normalization method has been proved to be an effective method schott et al 1988 yang and lo 2000 one basic premise behind this method is that the radiance reaching the satellite sensor in a given spectral channel can be expressed as a linear function of reflectivity schott et al 1988 thus the atmospheric and calibration differences between the subject image usually on a later date and reference image usually on an earlier date are linearly related yang and lo 2000 in this paper the landsat images for 2017 and 2018 as the latest image data were chosen as reference images for the dry and wet seasons respectively then dense woodland clear water and sand were selected as relatively stable pixels whose surface features can be considered unchanged during the 40 year study period han et al 2015 after a reference image was selected the radiometric characteristics of the subject images were adjusted to match the reference images through the linear regression normalization method therefore the surface radiation of all landsat images was basically consistent and the classification maps derived from the images were deemed to be comparable 3 3 training samples and method selection the dongting lake wetland is complicated and has various land cover types various types of land use and land cover classification systems have been proposed to meet different research purposes shalaby and tateishi 2007 yuan et al 2005 zurqani et al 2018 in this study the dongting lake wetland has been classified into four different types including water vegetation mudflat and sand and detailed functions of these types can be found at dronova et al 2011 han et al 2015 demonstrated that four types could be effectively distinguished in the visible to near infrared nir regions high resolution images can be collected from google earth for training samples selection and determination knorn et al 2009 the training samples within the dongting wetland boundary were acquired based on quickbird images from google earth to classify different land cover types various supervised classification methods e g parallelepiped minimum distance mahalanobis distance maximum likelihood and neural net have been used to produce land cover classification maps however most of the supervised classification schemes require a sufficiently large number of training samples and have some defects such as over learning dimension disasters and local minimums mountrakis et al 2011a b the support vector machine svm method is a group of supervised learning methods that can be applied for classification or regression and the method was proposed by cortes and vapnik 1995 svm performs better with a limited amount of reference data and effectively avoids some of the drawbacks of other methods which have been demonstrated by many researchers mountrakis et al 2011a b raghavendra and deka 2014 compared with maximum likelihood classifiers bhagawat et al 2019 recommended svm as a suitable option for precise classification of land cover thus the svm method was chosen for the dongting lake wetland classification in this study 3 4 classification and change detection before supervised classification a multi band attribute image is required containing the spectral bands of satellite images and other information to increase the accuracy of classification the green band red band nir band dem and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi were combined to create a multi band attribute image in this study the ndvi was derived from the red and nir ratio as follows ndvi λ nir λ r λ nir λ r where λnir is reflectance in the nir band 770 900 nm for landsat 5 and 7 and 850 880 nm for landsat 8 and λr is reflectance in the red spectral band 630 690 nm for landsat 5 and 7 and 640 670 nm for landsat 8 lai et al 2018 pan et al 2018 traditionally a classifier can only be used on the specific image containing the training samples and not on other images the new envi classification framework necf a powerful and flexible classification method is provided by envi 5 4 to conduct supervised classification based on an image a classifier can be created and trained through necf and then applied to other similar remote sensing images the classification results of dongting lake wetland were derived from the following steps 1 extract attributes from images different land cover attributes were extracted based on the training samples selected from google earth 2 shuffle and split samples the training samples were randomly scrambled and then divided into two parts 80 of the samples were used to train the svm classifier and the remaining 20 were used to assess the classification accuracy 3 iterative training the iterative trainer does not interfere with classifier evolution was used in conjunction with the svm classifier support self renewal to converge the error to a minimum through continuous iterations the key parameters used in iterative trainer was set as follows 100 for maximum iterations and 0 001 for convergence criterion 4 evaluate classifier and classify images a confusion matrix was generated using 20 samples and the classification accuracy assessment indices overall accuracy kappa coefficient omission and commission errors for each class were calculated to evaluate the accuracy of the classifier after the classifier was evaluated the classification results can be obtained by inputting multi band attribute images into the trained classifier following the classification of imagery a post classification change detection algorithm was used to quantitatively analyze the characteristics of surface changes from remote sensing data in different periods this is the most common change detection approach shalaby and tateishi 2007 the post classification approach provides from to information and the change type between two classification images of the same scene taken at different times yuan et al 2005 zurqani et al 2018 the approach was applied in four intervals 1979 2003 and 2003 2017 for the dry season 1981 2003 and 2003 2018 for the wet season and the change details of sdlnnr also enlarged the classification maps of 1978 1981 2017 and 2018 for two different seasons were selected because they are placed at the start and end of the observed period two other classification maps in 2003 were chosen because they are the closest years to the impoundment of the tgd to better understand the wetland vegetation changing trend the changing rate of ndvi was calculated in the dry and wet seasons respectively the changing rate was obtained by linear regression based on the ndvi value of the selected image and its collection time 4 results and discussion 4 1 long term wetland changes in dry seasons during dry seasons the vegetation continuously expanded eastward and southward and linearly increased from 2355 55 km2 to 2534 51 km2 in 1979 2017 figs 2 a and 3 a which was the most notable change during the entire study period the change trend of vegetation in donting lake was divided into two different stages one of which increased at a rate of 44 22 km2 a from 1979 to 2001 and the other one decreased at a rate of 24 36 km2 a from 2003 to 2017 consistent with hu et al 2015a b the water area in dongting lake wetland dramatically decreased from 2000 to 2012 in this study the water area in dongting lake shrank towards the center of the lake declining from the original 941 79 km2 in 1978 to 729 87 km2 in 2018 fig 3a the change trend of water in dongting lake was also divided into two different stages of which it decreased at a rate of 37 23 km2 a p 0 05 for the period of 1979 2001 and increased at a rate of 20 05 km2 a p 0 05 from 2003 to 2017 during 1979 2017 the vegetation and water area of the sdlnnr presented expanding and shrinking trends respectively but the changing rate slowed after 2003 the vegetation of the sdlnnr increased at a rate of 4 17 km2 a and 1 08 km2 a in the pre and post tgd periods respectively the water area of the sdlnnr decreased at a rate of 5 26 km2 a and 0 46 km2 a in the pre and post tgd periods figs 2b and 3b respectively the variation of mudflat and sand areas of the sdlnnr was similar to that of the entire lake and showed a fluctuating downward trend as shown in fig 4 the mutual conversion of vegetation water mudflat and sand was intense and concentrated at the junction of land and water after 2003 the transition area narrowed remarkably the transition area accounted for 19 56 and 14 07 of dongting lake wetland in the pre and post tgd periods respectively among the various types of transitions the most prominent change was that the mudflat 150 04 km2 and water 254 47 km2 changed to vegetation during the pre tgd period and the vegetation 237 21 km2 changed to mudflat and water in the post tgd period table 2 the expansion of vegetation during the pre tgd period was mainly from the water and mudflat area in south dongting lake and east dongting lake fig 4a after 2003 these transitions significantly decreased and the major transition was replaced by the transition from vegetation to water 132 94 km2 and mudflat 104 27 km2 which resulted in declined vegetation and increased water during the post tgd the submergence conditions changed although the land cover change of dongting lake during the entire study period was complicated the increase in vegetation was unquestionable as shown in fig 5 a except for the vegetation growth that was inhibited in the southern part of east dongting lake the entire map was dominated by a greenish color which indicated that the vegetation was prosperous during the study period in addition the vegetation of the sdlnnr experienced dramatic expansion during the 40 year period the ndvi values presented insignificant changes in the offshore regions indicating that the vegetation cover has been stable for many years 4 2 influence of the tgd on vegetation area in dry seasons the amount of water entering dongting lake decreased seasonally due to the operation of the tgd and the corresponding water level also declined seasonally hu et al 2015a b xie et al 2014 in addition to the limited increased in february and june the climatological monthly mean water level of the chenglingji station had decreased compared with pre tgd period fig 7 a and table 4 the reduction of water level from july to october was prominent with a value greater than 1 4 m these seasonal fluctuations of water level were closely related to the dispatch scheme which released water from february and regulated floodwater from july to september during the post tgd period the duration days of high water level also decreased and the most significant change occurred in the range of 30 32 m fig 7c and table 3 which could attribute to the water impoundment during the fall seasons the change in water level and duration days directly affected the submerged conditions of dongting lake which had a great impact on vegetation growth xie et al 2014 strong negative correlation r 0 88 p 0 05 was revealed between the vegetation area and the inundation area during the pre tgd period but this correlation weakened after 2003 fig 6a during the impoundment periods of tgd the water area decreased and the lake bottom exposure time increased wu et al 2017 which changed the hydrological conditions based on different topographies the increased exposure time of lake bottom promoted the growth of vegetation distributed at the junction of land and water figs 4 and 5a however the increased exposure time led to enhanced evaporation and reduced soil moisture in some areas that were infrequently submerged far from lake center with higher elevation feng et al 2016 moeslund et al 2013 the growth of vegetation in these areas was restricted which was revealed by the transition maps and the ndvi changing rate maps figs 4 and 5a furthermore the bottom topography of the lake was significantly influenced by the deposition of sediment dongting lake received water and sediment from four tributaries and three outlets of the yangtze river fig 1 a series of human activities such as the closing of the tiaoxuan outlets the cut straight of jingjiang and the operation of gezhou dam and the tgd greatly influenced the inflow and sediment situation of dongting lake li et al 2009 xia et al 2016 but the operation of tgd has different effects on sediment and runoff the input annual amount of water and sediment to the dongting lake approximately reduced 11 67 and 83 99 after 2003 fig 7d and e the impact of sediment deposition changes on the vegetation deserved attention according to xie and chen 2008 the speed and mode of sedimentation determined the evolution trend and direction of wetland vegetation fig 6c shows the relationship between the classified vegetation area of the dongting lake wetland and sediment deposition which is defined as the difference between the sediment flow into and out of dongting lake during the pre tgd period a strong correlation r 0 84 p 0 05 was found between vegetation and deposition indicating that vegetation expansion was remarkably affected by sediment deposition before 2003 heavy sediment deposition accelerated the expansion of the shoal to promote the growth of terrestrial vegetation jing et al 2017 and increased the turbidity of the water body to inhibit the growth of aquatic plants however the operation of tgd alleviated sediment deposition and led to a change in the dynamic balance between sediment input and output hu et al 2015a b xu and milliman 2009 as shown in fig 7d a historic change occurred in that the sediment output of the lake exceeded the deposition in 2003 and a negative value of deposition first occurred in 2010 indicating that dongting lake changed from trapping to supplying sediment to the yangtze river in addition according to the previous studies the change of sediment conditions in dongting area includes volume and component yang et al 2017 these changes not only affect the terrain of dongting lake area but also complicate the water turbidity of dongting lake li et al 2009 the reduced sediment amount and coarse sand particles directly reduced the turbidity of water and enhanced light transmittance which affected vegetation growth and species distributions sheridan et al 1998 after the deposition mode changed the plant community of the dongting lake wetland mainly succeeded in a slow manner xie and chen 2008 and other factors gradually increased the impact on vegetation expansion the variation of meteorological elements was considered another prominent cause of vegetation area change over the past 40 years a consistent increase has been observed in air temperature xie et al 2017 while no significant trend was found in either inter annual or inter month changes in local precipitation fig 7b and table 4 according to jiang et al 2011 the precipitation and ndvi exhibited prominent correlation in the dongting lake wetland watershed region however the fluctuations of local precipitation measured at the nearest meteorological station of dongting lake did not have a significant impact on the vegetation variation therefore the growth of vegetation was closely related to the precipitation conditions of the entire dongting lake watershed region but was limited affected by local precipitation correlation analysis between the vegetation area and temperature revealed that the change in vegetation area in dry seasons was unlikely to be affected by the temperature near the time of data acquisition however the change was deeply affected by the mean temperature between july and september r 0 79 p 0 05 fig 6d the combination of high temperature and large inundation area was conducive to the expansion of vegetation during the pre tgd period the high water level inundation days reduced and the hydrothermal conditions in the dongting lake area also changed after 2003 sun et al 2012 which altered the relationship between vegetation area and temperature the flood regulation and water storage schemes of the tgd lowered the water level in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and prompted dongting lake to increase its output flow to compensate for the river fig 7a hu et al 2015a b the monthly mean water level of chenglingji station declined significantly from july to october and the duration days of the high water level decreased remarkably which led to the reduced water area and the increased lake bottomland exposure time the changes in vegetation species and distribution occurred due to the extended exposure time of the lake bottomland which affected the ndvi value in the dongting lake wetland furthermore the decrease in soil moisture as shown by the decline in the water level led to the inhibition of vegetation growth especially in the region away from the lake center meanwhile the decrease of the high water level duration and the reduction of sediment amount and coarse sand particles enhanced light transmittance which was beneficial to the photosynthesis of the lake bottom plants and promoted the growth of vegetation sheridan et al 1998 interestingly the relationship between vegetation area and mean temperature between july and september changed after 2003 which was attributed to the inhibition of vegetation growth with increasing evaporation and decreasing soil moisture 4 3 long term wetland changes in wet seasons and influence of the tgd during the wet seasons the vegetation and water area fluctuated greatly before 2003 and the fluctuated range significantly narrowed during the post tgd period figs 3c and 8 a specifically vegetation increased from 1433 58 603 48 km2 to 1632 62 234 39 km2 in the entire lake fig 3c compared with the large fluctuation range during pre tgd periods the initially operation of tgd has already affected the inundation area of dongting lake wetland since 2003 fig 3c however the vegetation area of sdlnnr in 2003 was inconsistent with the long term change trend of vegetation during the post tgd period fig 3c this means that the impact of tgd on land cover in dongting lake wetland is on a short time scale and the vegetation has not adapted to the variation of hydrological regime during the study period the expansion of vegetation mainly occurred along the west bank of east dongting lake and south dongting lake and in the northern part of west dongting lake fig 8a yan et al 2017 in contrast the water body showed a decreasing trend and fluctuated range was significantly narrowed after 2003 fig 8a this was attributed to the dispatch scheme of tgd which aims to alleviated flood water pressure of downstream during wet seasons the distribution of the rapid inter conversion between vegetation and water was also shown in the transition map fig 9 and table 5 and the main change between 2003 and 2018 was the transition from water to vegetation fig 9c accounting for 91 95 of the change area which was concentrated in the sdlnnr fig 9d the change in the sdlnnr was similar and more significant to that of the whole lake with vegetation increasing from 22 26 km2 to 66 52 km2 and water decreasing from 83 64 km2 to 39 32 km2 in the entire sdlnnr during 1978 2018 the changes in ndvi were roughly divided into two parts during the wet seasons fig 5b the western region of the entire map presented a greenish color indicating that the vegetation flourished and the remainder of the map presented the opposite situation moreover datong lake where the change was not remarkable using other analyses methods also showed positive values in the ndvi change rate map during the wet seasons especially in the northeast corner fig 5c the results indicated that the vegetation area of dongting lake wetland experienced fluctuated expansion and that the submergence conditions changed during wet seasons to test whether the land cover change of the dongting lake wetland was driven by the operation of the tgd the relationship between the vegetation area of the sdlnnr and the 30 day mean water level before the image acquisition date of nanju station was analyzed fig 6b a correlation r 0 75 p 0 05 was revealed in the entire study period a significant negative correlation was found with a coefficient r of 0 91 p 0 05 in the period of 1994 2001 the vegetation growth was greatly affected by the frequency timing and duration of the water level fluctuations hu et al 2015a b but the hydrological environment of dongting lake changed after 2003 during the pre tgd period the three outlets undertaken a large amount of water and sediment from the yangtze river which promoted the vegetation growth of the sdlnnr after 2003 the runoff and sediment flow into dongting lake dramatic declined li et al 2009 the difference between the mean water level of the pre and post tgd periods in nanju station ranged from 1 2 to 0 9 m during july october fig 7a and table 4 which was attributed to the flood regulation and water storage schemes the duration days of high water level also declined during the post tgd period which enhanced light transmittance and facilitated the photosynthesis of the lake bottom plants feng et al 2016 4 4 potential effects of other factors to understand the potential factors that lead to the change in classified wetland vegetation the correlations between other meteorological factors and vegetation were examined most of the relationships were statistically insignificant although high wind speed could stir the lake water in a short period thus changing turbidity it appears to be smeared in the calculation of monthly mean statistics hou et al 2017 dongting basin was shaped by tectonic movement but the formation and change of dongting lake were closely related to the roles of rivers and human activities su et al 2001 at the beginning of the quaternary dongting basin was affected by neotectonic movement and the peripheral mountain increased intermittently at the same time the lake basin declined by the late pleistocene the tectonic activity almost stopped forming the prototype of dongting lake basin since the holocene natural evolution has been relatively stable and human activities have strengthened su et al 2001 since 1949 increasing population and economic development have led to the intensive reclamation of the dongting lake wetland however several ecological restoration projects have been conducted by the chinese government since 1978 and the environment of dongting lake has gradually recovered with the reduction of human activities thus the tectonic movement and reclamation activities were not considered as the main reasons for the land cover changes of the dongting lake wetland the poplar plantation history has been going on for more than 40 years in dongting lake wetland which may also affect the long term change of vegetation area jing et al 2016 li et al 2015 because poplar cultivation can alleviate the tight supply of paper materials and promote the development of a local economy li et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 from introduced poplar in the 1970s to large scale planting in the late 1990s the poplar plantation areas increased 9 fold from 1978 to 2002 in dongting lake wetland jing et al 2016 according to yu et al 2019 although the poplar planting squeezed the living space of phragmite the total area of poplars and phragmite increased 50 from 1978 to 2002 which was consistent with the remotely sensed results in this study and was revealed in the transition maps fig 4 then the total areas of poplar and phragmite were basically unchanged from 2002 to 2014 yu et al 2019 however the accumulation of excessive poplar plantations has caused serious ecological degradation of the dongting lake wetland ecosystem xie et al 2007 since 2014 the local government implemented the return forest to wetland project to protect the health of the ecosystem this policy remarkably reduced the poplar area and effectively restored the growth space of phragmite and lake weed jing et al 2016 since the transition was occurred among different vegetation types the total vegetation area did not change significantly yu et al 2019 however compared with poplar the growth of phragmite was more easily influenced by the variation of hydrological environment which means that the impoundment of tgd may have a greater impact on vegetation area of dongting lake wetland in the future hence the cultivation of poplar and phragmite is a significant driving factors in the long term change of vegetation area especially during the pre tgd period dongting lake serves as an important habitat on the migratory line of east asia australian migratory birds zou et al 2019 the wetland vegetation might be affected by migratory bird over grazing resulting in a decrease of the ndvi values however this possibility was easily eliminated because the vegetation area of sdlnnr as one of the major habitats for migratory birds has shown an expanding trend during the study period meanwhile the variation in vegetation influenced the quantities of migratory birds that feed on vegetation the expansion of vegetation provided an appropriate living environment and adequate food sources for wetland migratory birds and was positively correlated with the quantity of wetland migratory birds zhang et al 2016 the remote sensing results of the vegetation area of sdlnnr presented an expanding trend which was consistent with the results by xiang et al 2017 who showed that the number of birds in east dongting lake during winter fluctuated upwardly from 2006 to 2013 the decline in water level affected the survival of aquatic animals and plants and may have reduced the number of birds that prey on fish correlation analysis showed that the water level and vegetation area of dongting lake were negatively correlated in this study which was consistent with the results of wu et al 2017 thus the land cover variation might change the proportion of migratory bird species of different diets in the dongting lake wetland in addition to the construction of tgd the land cover variation of the dongting lake wetland was inevitably affected by other aspects of human activities and natural environmental changes however due to the difficulty of obtaining data these aspects could only be speculated in previous research and their specific impacts on the dongting lake wetland require further confirmation 4 5 validity and defects of the observations when monitoring a region data with a higher temporal resolution should be selected for continuous monitoring throughout the year considering spatial resolution and long term data records landsat images seem to provide the most suitable dataset for research needs according to the study of han et al 2015 the four cover types of dongting lake wetland were demonstrated to be distinguishable in the visible to nir regions which ensured the accuracy of the classification results to some extent in addition considering that the dongting lake area is dominated by a subtropical monsoon climate the data selected in summer and winter are suitable for studying long term trends xian et al 2009 taking the dry season as an example the difference between the classified vegetation and water areas from two consecutive images in 2013 39 days apart was 1 01 and 1 49 fig 10 respectively similar results were observed from other pairs of images not shown here during dry seasons indicating that the vegetation and water areas were relatively stable in a short period 1 2 months the uncertainties caused by image timing should be smaller compared with these by long term interannual changes thus the current dataset was the optimal choice for monitoring the long term changes of dongting lake wetland the remote sensing images used in this paper involved data from four landsat instruments and the total signal acquired by each sensor includes the radiance from both the target and the noise in the transmission young et al 2017 the flaash atmospheric correction methods were used to remove some of the noise from transmission kaufman et al 1997 the linear regression normalization method was then used to ensure that the surface radiation of all landsat images was basically consistent yang and lo 2000 although each sensor had different band settings three green red and nir information rich and wavelength matched bands were included in all sensors the dem and ndvi data were combined with three bands to compose multi band attribute datasets as the base map for the classification then the multi band attribute datasets were inputted in necf to classify four decades of landsat imagery which greatly reduced the workload and maintained the consistency of the results subsequently the classification validation process was conducted in addition to the 20 samples for accuracy verification in the annual classification the 30 samples were taken to check the classification results of 1998 and 2016 in both dry and wet seasons with an accuracy of over 88 therefore the uncertainties of the remote sensing images had a slight effect on the accuracy of the classification results the accuracy of the classification results could meet the needs of the research the overall accuracies and kappa coefficient of all the results were higher than 83 and 0 79 respectively in this study some defects also existed firstly although the 30 m dem data acquired in 2009 could represent most of the bottom topography from 1978 to 2018 some lake segments remarkably affected by sediment deposition cannot be properly represented by it which caused minor errors in the classification results after supervised classification a visual post processing was conducted to remove potential classification errors to ensure the accuracy of the results secondly the water level data of chenglingji and nanju stations could only be acquired since 1993 which caused the analysis to be insufficient during the pre tgd period thirdly the precipitation data of the whole dongting drainage basin could be collected to further analyze the changes in the dongting lake wetland in addition other possible human activities such as illegal sand dredging and adjusting channel structures might have an impact on the dongting lake wetland zheng et al 2015 zheng et al 2016 but this study did not involve the analysis of these factors due to the difficulty in obtaining data it is necessary to continuously monitor and conduct further research on the land cover changes and driving factors of the dongting lake wetland 5 conclusions this study monitored the land cover variations in the dongting lake wetland in last four decades and revealed the following valuable findings 1 in dry seasons the vegetation area in dongting lake increased at a rate of 44 22 km2 a p 0 05 and the water area in dongting lake decreased at a rate of 37 23 km2 a p 0 05 from 1979 to 2001 before 2003 the transition mainly concentrated at the junction of land and water and the major transition was water changed to vegetation after the operation of tgd the vegetation area in dongting lake decreased at a rate of 24 36 km2 a p 0 05 and the water area in dongting lake increased at a rate of 20 05 km2 a p 0 05 from 2003 to 2017 the transition zone was remarkably narrowed and the major transitions were replaced by the transition from vegetation to water and mudflat 2 in wet seasons vegetation 1433 58 603 48 km2 and water area 2153 32 603 98 km2 fluctuated greatly in the pre tgd period and the variation range significantly narrowed after 2003 1632 62 234 39 km2 of vegetation 1958 5 235 04 km2 of water 3 during the pre tgd period long term variation of the dongting lake wetland was affected by various factors including the water level the water inundation area the sedimentation and the mean temperature from july to september but the original driving mechanism and the hydrological environment in the dongting lake area changed after the impoundment of tgd which was likely the main cause of wetland changes in recent years the findings of this study were significant for understanding the impacts resulting from the tgd on dongting lake wetland and the future evolution of dongting lake moreover with droughts frequently occurring the water turbidity hydraulic gradient and other hydrological factors of dongting lake have also changed in recent years which might influence the vegetation types and water quality of the wetland system these subtle variation and deep driving factors are worth exploring further and the results of this study might provide baseline information for future research this study can also help the local government agencies make management decisions in the future by providing critical information and technical support such as whether another dam should be built in the lake to conserve water storage of dongting lake furthermore the method used in this study could be easily extended to other large research regions with infrequently topographical variation and monitored their long term variation credit authorship contribution statement liu yang data curation writing original draft lunche wang conceptualization methodology software supervision project
