22500,in order to solve the problem of more energy saving and safer course keeping control for large oil tanker under heavy sea state conditions a hyperbolic tangent function was used as a new nonlinear feedback function to re examine the nonlinear feedback in this paper the new control algorithm was theoretically proved by describing function and the stability analysis of the system was carried out through nyquist curve taking yukun and new triumph oil tanker as examples systematic comparative simulations of hyperbolic tangent function and sine function were carried out it was found that sine function was better than the hyperbolic tangent function for the course keeping control of general ship under normal sea state conditions however for large oil tanker under heavy sea state conditions the hyperbolic tangent function could achieve almost the same control effect as sine function while the maximum rudder angle decreased by 39 and the average rudder angle decreased by 36

the contributions are mainly twofold 1 the hyperbolic tangent function is used as a new nonlinear feedback function to re examine the nonlinear feedback in this paper the new control algorithm is theoretically proved by describing function and the stability analysis of the system is carried out through nyquist curve 2 from the systematic comparative simulations and numerical investigations compared with the sine function the nonlinear algorithm modified by hyperbolic tangent has obvious advantages in the course keeping control of large oil tanker under heavy sea state conditions 2 nonlinear feedback control system driven by hyperbolic tangent function fig 1 shows the structure diagram of the nonlinear feedback control system driven by hyperbolic tangent function the difference between the system modified by sine function and the system driven by hyperbolic tangent function is that tanh ω 1 r y replaces sin ω r y ω and ω 1 are the system frequency consider a course keeping

closed loop gain shaping is presented through survey of the singular value curve of h s t mixed sensitivity as well as the correlativity of s sensitivity function and t complementary sensitivity function the typical s t singular value curve is shown in fig 2 in order to make the system robust and stable the closed loop spectrum of the system is required to be low pass and the maximum singular value is 1 to ensure that the reference signal is tracked with zero steady state error in this paper let the ship follow the set course ψ r set the bandwidth frequency of the closed system to 1 t 1 1 t 1 should be crossover frequency in the strict sense and let the high frequency asymptote slope be 20db dec for the controller design the frequency spectrum of the closed loop system is made equal to the frequency spectrum of a first order inertial system with the largest singular value approximately one then 2 k s 1 t 1 s 1 g k 1 g k k 1 g t 1 s substituting nomoto model of ship into equation 2 equation 3 is obtained 3 k s 1 k 0 t 1 ε k 0 t 1 1 s t 0 k 0 t 1 s in actual application we discover that the settling time is relatively long for ships with large time constants such as oil tankers etc the dynamic performance of course keeping control system for ships can be improved greatly when a positive constant ρ is added to the proportional part of the control law equation 3 the corresponding theoretical analysis and simulation tests are given in reference zhang and guan 2010a then the controller is obtained 4 k s 1 k 0 t 1 ρ ε k 0 t 1 1 s t 0 k 0 t 1 s 2 1 effect of nonlinear feedback driven by hyperbolic tangent function on system the hyperbolic tangent function tanh ω1 r y is expanded by taylor series and retained to the second order 5 tanh ω 1 r y ω 1 r y ω 1 r y 3 3 2 ω 1 r y 5 15 let the error e r y equation 6 is simplified then 6 f e ω 1 e ω 1 3 e 3 3 2 ω 1 e 5 15 according to describing function the output of the nonlinear system under the action of a sine signal can be approximated by the first harmonic element and the equivalent frequency characteristics is the describing function of the nonlinear system at this point the steady output of the nonlinear system can be analyzed harmonically then its output can be expressed as equation 7 using its first order harmonic element of the fourier series ciaurri et al 2010 hu 2007 wang et al 2018 7 f t a 0 a 1 cos ω 0 t b 1 sin ω 0 t where a 0 is the dc component a 1 b 1 are the first order harmonic components equation 6 is an odd function thus a 0 0 when e a sin ω 0 t 8 f t ω 1 a sin ω 0 t 5 ω 1 3 a sin ω 0 t 3 2 ω 1 5 a sin ω 0 t 5 15 equation 8 is also an odd function of t so a 1 0 because of the semi cyclic symmetry property of f t then 9 b 1 4 π 0 π 2 f t sin ω 0 t d ω 0 t 4 π 0 π 2 ω 1 a sin 2 ω 0 t d ω 0 t 0 π 2 ω 1 3 a 3 3 sin 4 ω 0 t d ω 0 t 0 π 2 2 15 ω 1 5 a 5 sin 6 ω 0 t d ω 0 t by definite integral formula 10 i n 0 π 2 sin n ω t d ω t n 1 n 3 4 2 n n 2 n 4 5 3 n is odd integer n 1 n 3 5 3 1 n n 2 4 2 π 2 n is even integer then 11 b 1 4 π ω 1 a π 4 ω 1 3 a 3 3 3 8 π 2 2 15 ω 1 5 a 5 5 16 π 2 so the describing function is obtained 12 n a b 1 a ω 1 ω 1 3 a 2 4 1 12 ω 1 5 a 4 in this case the nonlinear system can be simplified to a typical structure with a nonlinear part and a linear part closed loop connection as shown in fig 3 2 2 effect on the steady state of the closed loop system let the reference input be a step signal its amplitude is r substituting 4 into k and g s k 0 t 0 s 2 s ε the steady state error to the step input is obtained directly by the final value theorem as given below 13 e lim s 0 s 1 1 g k n a r s lim s 0 r 1 1 t 1 s ρ k 0 s t 0 s 1 ε ω 1 ω 1 3 a 2 4 1 12 ω 1 5 a 4 0 therefore the nonlinear feedback driven by hyperbolic tangent function has no extra effect on the steady state of the system 2 3 effect on the dynamic performance of the closed loop system based on the block diagram of the nonlinear feedback system shown in fig 3 the transfer function from the setting course ψ to the ship s heading angle ψ r can be obtained as equation 14 14 ψ r ψ g k n a 1 g k n a for the ship course keeping problem wave action is a high frequency disturbance whose frequency spectrum lies in the range of 0 3 1 25 rad s however 1 t 1 0 3 rad s successfully shy away from the wave frequency spectrum and generally takes 0 25 rad s suppose the range of course changing is between 0 2πrad then 0 n a ω 1 according to the closed loop gain shaping theory the open loop transfer matrix gk satisfy robust performance in the low frequency zone and robust stability in the high frequency zone zhang 2012 therefore compared with the closed loop transfer function gk 1 gk of the standard feedback system the addition of n a has little effect on the dynamic performance of the system thus the proper trade off between the stabilising performance and the robustness can be obtained by selecting the corresponding parameter setting appropriately 2 4 effect on the output of the closed loop system as shown in fig 3 the transfer function from ship setting course ψ to controller output δ is obtained 15 δ ψ k n a 1 g k n a similar analysis as for equation 14 the numerator of formula 15 decreases more than the denominator so the introduction of n a can bring about the benefit of reducing the output of the controller in addition the hyperbolic tangent function can make the maximum and minimum values of the error input of the controller within 1 similar processing technique can be seen in fuzzy control neural network and optimising genetic algorithms 2 5 proof of the stability of the whole nonlinear closed loop system in order to illustrate the stability of the whole closed loop system with the nonlinear part fig 3 is further simplified and the simplified block diagram is shown in fig 4 at this point g 1 in fig 4 is equivalent to kg in fig 3 i e 16 g 1 1 t 1 s ρ k 0 s t 0 s 1 ε t 0 s 2 t 1 ρ k 0 1 s ε t 0 s 2 s ε t 1 s since the nonlinear characteristics are approximately equivalent by describing function the stability analysis of the closed loop system is based on plotting 1 n a and g j ω in the same nyquist diagram if the g j ω curve does not enclose the 1 n a curve the nonlinear system is stable if it is surrounded it is unstable if there is an intersection the limit cycle may be formed and further stability analysis according to the direction of motion is needed in this case the characteristic equation of the closed loop system is obtained 17 1 n a g 1 j ω 0 that is 18 g 1 j ω 1 n a 1 n a is called the negative reciprocal description function of the nonlinear system fig 5 is two curves obtained from simulation data in fig 5 the solid line represents the nyquist curve of the nonlinear system and the dotted line represents the negative reciprocal describing function curve of the nonlinear system the negative reciprocal describing function curve in the figure is not surrounded by the nyquist curve of the system in the direction of the arrow which proves that the nonlinear system is stable 3 norrbin mathematical model and simulation of nonlinear ship motion 3 1 norrbin nonlinear mathematical model

coefficient c in equation 21 is the dimensionless crossflow coefficient d m is the draft of midship l is the length between the two perpendiculars of the ship and r is the angular velocity of the ship the wind term f wind is divided into average wind and fluctuating wind for average wind and fluctuating wind the calculation programs are written into the ship model for wave force term f wave a linear wave model is used to replace the complex nonlinear wave model a linear approximation of international towing tank conference ittc spectral density function can be written 22 y s h s ω s where ω s is a zero mean gaussian white noise process with a power spectrum of g ω ω ω 1 0 and h s is a second order transfer function 23 h s k ω s s 2 2 ζ ω 2 s ω 2 2 k ω is defined as k ω 2 ζ ω 0 σ ω

6 24 h s 1 1949 s s 2 0 3637 s 0 3675 in order to be more accordance with the reality of navigation the course keeping control system with pure delay dead zone hysteresis saturation and other nonlinear characteristics is approximated as a first order inertia component in consideration of the maximum rudder angle and steering speed and according to the analysis of actual marine test steering data the steering gear system is limited to operate a rudder as fast as 6 s 3 2 numerical simulations and result analysis the numerical simulations are carried out in simulink the solver is ode45 and solver s type is variable step the ship speed used in the transfer function of the mathematical model of ship motion is the normal operating speed of the ship in table 1 taking the new triumph oil tanker as an example the ship parameters under fully loaded are shown in table 1 where b is the beam of ship x c is the distance from centre of gravity to the midship a r is rudder area v is ship speed is displacement c b is the block coefficient of ship the parameters of the pid controller in the numerical simulation are obtained by referring to the closed loop gain shaping algorithm and the parameters of the controller are further adjusted according to the theoretical proof in this paper where ρ 1 ε 1 t 1 0 3 thus the closed loop system can block the spectrum of ocean waves out of the effective frequency band in order to better illustrate the advantages of nonlinear algorithm modified by hyperbolic tangent function for large oil tanker under heavy sea state conditions firstly the simulation is carried out on the nonlinear feedback parameters of the two algorithms when they are applied for optimal course keeping control in two cases one is general ship in normal sea state conditions the other is large oil tanker under heavy sea state conditions in order to better compare the two algorithms absolute error mean mae and average rudder angle mic are introduced to characterize the performance of the system in course keeping and energy consumption 25 mae 1 t s t 0 t 0 t s ψ r ψ t d t mic 1 t s t 0 t 0 t s δ t d t tables 3 and 4 are the numerical investigations of two algorithms applied to general ship taking training ship yukun of dalian maritime university as an example and normal sea state conditions taking the wind scale of beaufort no 5 an example for optimum nonlinear feedback parameters when the ship s course is maintained at 30 the parameters of ship yukun under the ballasted condition are shown in table 2 the second order wave transfer function corresponding to beaufort no 5 is obtained and the corresponding wind generated wave is shown in fig 7 26 h s 0 2239 s s 2 0 3637 s 0 3675 due to the performance standards of the mainstream ship autopilot in the current market require that the difference of ship course keeping under normal sea conditions should be within 1 0 5 and that the rudder angle above 3 is the effective rudder angle in actual ship maneuvering through the numerical investigation and the curve of rudder angle in course keeping control 0 19 and 0 17 are obtained as the optimal nonlinear feedback parameters of the two algorithms under the same conditions assuming that the numerical simulation is carried out under the condition that the ship has a setting course of 30 a wind force of beaufort no 5 and a wind direction of 40 applying 0 19 and 0 17 as the optimal nonlinear feedback parameters of the two algorithms for numerical simulations the simulation results are shown in fig 8 comparing the data of tables and figures the nonlinear algorithm modified by sine function in general ship under normal sea state conditions is slightly better than the nonlinear algorithm modified by hyperbolic tangent function in terms of heading stability difference and rudder angle energy consumption tables 5 and 6 respectively show the numerical investigations of the optimum nonlinear feedback parameters for large oil tanker under heavy sea state conditions when the heading is stable at 30 considering the heading stability difference and the rudder angle energy consumption during the steering process 0 15 and 0 20 are obtained as the optimal nonlinear feedback parameters of the two algorithms from the comparison of the data in tables 5 and 6 it is found that the numerical investigations are opposite to those of the general ship under normal sea state conditions assuming that the numerical simulation is carried out under the condition that the ship has a setting course of 30 a wind force of beaufort no 9 and a wind direction of 40 applying 0 15 and 0 20 as the optimal nonlinear feedback parameters of the two algorithms for numerical simulations the simulation results are shown in fig 9 by comparing the simulation results in fig 9 it can be seen that the time for the two kinds of nonlinear feedback to reach the steady state is basically the same when the control effect is almost the same the maximum rudder angle of the nonlinear feedback modified by hyperbolic tangent is 18 which is 39 lower than that modified by sine function from tables 5 and 6 it can be seen that the improved nonlinear feedback algorithm has smaller course difference than the original algorithm while reducing the average rudder angle from 3 6559 to 2 6858 and the average rudder angle decreasing by 36 in the whole control process at the same time it avoids the sudden excessive rudder angle steered in the control process which makes the large oil tanker under the heavy sea state conditions achieve the course keeping more safely and smoothly in addition the controller design in this paper only uses the linear notomo model while the simulation uses the nonlinear norrbin model with the nonlinear characteristic limitation of the steering servo system that is equivalent to the model perturbation and the course keeping control effect is still satisfactory which shows that the designed controller has good robustness 4 conclusion in order to design a controller with better control effect for large oil tanker so as to ensure that large oil tanker can keep their course in a more stable energy saving and safer way under heavy sea state conditions the difference between the modified setting value and the output decorated by the hyperbolic function is proposed as the feedback signal driving controller in this paper and the good control effect of this algorithm is proved theoretically this algorithm is a kind of essential nonlinear feedback without obviously changing the output performance of the controller it achieves the same control effect with less control energy consumption which is beneficial for large oil tanker under heavy sea state conditions in this paper yukun and new triumph are used as examples to simulate the nonlinear feedback control algorithm when the wind scale of beaufort no 9 and the course setting is 30 the maximum rudder angle drops by 39 and the average rudder angle also decreases from 3 6559 to 2 6858 with a drop of 36 the controller responds well to the steering command and maintains the ship s course in a safer ship attitude which is of great significance for the actual steering of a large oil tanker under heavy sea state conditions but through simulation it is found that although the stability time of the final course is approximately the same as that of the nonlinear feedback algorithm modified by sine function the response speed of the course in the process of stabilization has no obvious advantage which may affect the more urgent situation of collision avoidance between large ships it will also affect and challenge the subsequent design of research that balances both response speed and efficiency control

the dynamic performance of the system thus the proper trade off between the stabilising performance and the robustness can be obtained by selecting the corresponding parameter setting appropriately 2

nonlinear characteristics are approximately equivalent by describing function the stability analysis of the closed loop system is based on plotting 1 n a and g j ω in the same nyquist diagram if the g j ω curve does not enclose the 1 n a curve the nonlinear system is stable if it is surrounded it is unstable if there is an intersection the limit cycle may be formed and further stability analysis according to the direction of motion is needed in this case the characteristic equation of the closed loop system is obtained 17 1 n a g 1 j ω 0 that is 18 g 1 j ω 1 n a 1 n a is called the negative reciprocal description function of the nonlinear system fig 5 is two curves obtained from simulation data in fig 5 the solid line represents the nyquist curve of the nonlinear system and the dotted line represents the negative reciprocal describing function curve of the nonlinear system the negative reciprocal describing function curve in the figure is not surrounded by the nyquist curve of the

nonlinear characteristics is approximated as a first order inertia component in consideration of the maximum rudder angle and steering speed and according to the analysis of actual marine test steering data the steering gear system is limited to operate a rudder as fast as 6 s 3 2 numerical simulations and result analysis the numerical simulations are carried out in simulink the solver is ode45 and solver s type is variable step the ship speed used in the transfer function of the mathematical model of ship motion is the normal operating speed of the ship in table 1 taking the new triumph oil tanker as an example the ship parameters under fully loaded are shown in table 1 where b is the beam of ship x c is the distance from centre of gravity to the midship a r is rudder area v is ship speed is displacement c b is the block coefficient of ship the parameters of the pid controller in the numerical simulation are obtained by referring to the closed loop gain shaping algorithm and the parameters of the controller are further adjusted according to the theoretical proof in this paper where ρ 1 ε 1 t 1 0 3 thus the closed loop system can block the spectrum of ocean waves out of the effective frequency band in order to better illustrate the advantages of nonlinear algorithm modified by hyperbolic tangent function for large oil tanker under heavy sea state conditions firstly the simulation is carried out on the nonlinear feedback parameters of the two algorithms when they are applied for optimal course keeping control in two cases one is general ship in normal sea state conditions the other is large oil tanker under heavy sea state conditions in order to better compare the two algorithms absolute error mean mae and average rudder angle mic are introduced to characterize the performance of the system in course keeping and energy consumption 25 mae 1 t s t 0 t 0 t s ψ r ψ t d t mic 1 t s t 0 t 0 t s δ t d t tables 3 and 4 are the numerical investigations of two algorithms applied to general ship taking training ship yukun of dalian maritime university as an example and normal sea state conditions taking the wind scale of beaufort no 5 an example for optimum nonlinear feedback parameters when the ship s course is maintained at 30 the parameters of ship yukun under the ballasted condition are shown in table 2 the second order wave transfer function corresponding to beaufort no 5 is obtained and the corresponding wind generated wave is shown in fig 7 26 h s 0 2239 s s 2 0 3637 s 0 3675 due to the performance standards of the mainstream ship autopilot in the current market require that the difference of ship course keeping under normal sea conditions should be within 1 0 5 and that the rudder angle above 3 is the effective rudder angle in actual ship maneuvering through the numerical investigation and the curve of rudder angle in course keeping control 0 19 and 0 17 are obtained as the optimal nonlinear feedback parameters of the two algorithms under the same conditions assuming that the numerical simulation is carried out under the condition that the ship has a setting course of 30 a wind force of beaufort no 5 and a wind direction of 40 applying 0 19 and 0 17 as the optimal nonlinear feedback parameters of the two algorithms for numerical simulations the simulation results are shown in fig 8 comparing the data of tables and figures the nonlinear algorithm modified by sine function in general ship under normal sea state conditions is slightly better than the nonlinear algorithm modified by hyperbolic tangent function in terms of heading stability difference and rudder angle energy consumption tables 5 and 6 respectively show the numerical investigations of the optimum nonlinear feedback parameters for large oil tanker under heavy sea state conditions when the heading is stable at 30 considering the heading stability difference and the rudder angle energy consumption during the steering process 0 15 and 0 20 are obtained as the optimal nonlinear feedback parameters of the two algorithms from the comparison of the data in tables 5 and 6 it is found that the numerical investigations are opposite to those of the general ship under normal sea state conditions assuming that the numerical simulation is carried out under the condition that the ship has a setting course of 30 a wind force of beaufort no 9 and a wind direction of 40 applying 0 15 and 0 20 as the optimal nonlinear feedback parameters of the two algorithms for numerical simulations the simulation results are shown in fig 9 by comparing the simulation results in fig 9 it can be seen that the time for the two kinds of nonlinear feedback to reach the steady state is basically the same when the control effect is almost the same the maximum rudder angle of the nonlinear feedback modified by hyperbolic tangent is 18 which is 39 lower than that modified by sine function from tables 5 and 6 it can be seen that the improved nonlinear feedback algorithm has smaller course difference than the original algorithm while reducing the average rudder angle from 3 6559 to 2 6858 and the average rudder angle decreasing by 36 in the whole control process at the same time it avoids the sudden excessive rudder angle steered in the control process which makes the large oil tanker under the heavy sea state conditions achieve the course keeping more safely and smoothly in addition the controller design in this paper only uses the linear notomo model while the simulation uses the nonlinear norrbin model with the nonlinear characteristic limitation of the steering servo system that is equivalent to the model perturbation and the course keeping control effect is still satisfactory which shows that the designed controller has good robustness 4 conclusion in order to design a controller with better control effect for large oil tanker so as to ensure that large oil tanker can keep their course in a more stable energy saving and safer way under heavy sea state conditions the difference between the modified setting value and the output decorated by the hyperbolic function is proposed as the feedback signal driving controller in this paper and the good control effect of this algorithm is proved theoretically this algorithm is a kind of essential nonlinear feedback without obviously changing the output performance of the controller it achieves the same control effect with less control energy consumption which is beneficial for large oil tanker under heavy sea state conditions in this paper yukun and new triumph are used as examples to simulate the nonlinear feedback control algorithm when the wind scale of beaufort no 9 and the course setting is 30 the maximum rudder angle drops by 39 and the average rudder angle also decreases from 3 6559 to 2 6858 with a drop of 36 the controller responds well to the steering command and maintains the ship s course in a safer ship attitude which is of great significance for the actual steering of a large oil tanker under heavy sea state conditions but through simulation it is found that although the stability time of the final course is approximately the same as that of the nonlinear feedback algorithm modified by sine function the response speed of the course in the process of stabilization has no obvious advantage which may affect the more urgent situation of collision avoidance between large ships it will also affect and challenge the subsequent design of research that balances both response speed and efficiency control

22501,the seismic responses of offshore structures and dams can be affected by the water structure interaction the structures are commonly modelled by finite element method fem if the infinite water layer is also modelled by fem then the computational costs are high in this paper an accurate and efficient substructure method is presented in a frequency domain for a 2d water structure interaction analysis in which the modified scaled boundary finite element method sbfem is applied at a general shaped water structure interface to replace the compressible water layer several numerical examples including offshore structures and a typical geometry gravity dam are provided to demonstrate the computational efficiency and accuracy of the proposed substructure method the effects of hydrodynamic pressure water compressibility and structure geometry on the seismic responses of offshore structures are analysed based on the proposed method keywords offshore structure scaled boundary finite element method substructure method general interface shape earthquake 1 introduction an earthquake analysis of offshore structures such as breakwaters and artificial islands and dam reservoir systems requires special considerations due to the water structure interaction it is well known that earthquakes can produce additional hydrodynamic pressures on structures in water hydrodynamic pressure can modify the seismic response and dynamic properties of the structure wei et al 2013 han and xu 1996 liaw and chopra 1974 the research on hydrodynamic pressure began with the gravity dam conducted by westergaard 1933 and the cylindrical tank by jacobsen 1949 the analytical method can be used to solve the hydrodynamic pressure on structures during earthquakes with a simple geometry such as a straight gravity dam westergaard 1933 first derived the analytical solution for the hydrodynamic pressure on a straight dam due to earthquake ground motions in which the dam was assumed to be rigid and the water was assumed to be incompressible based on the momentum balance method chwang and housner 1978 presented an explicit analytical formula for the hydrodynamic pressure on a rigid dam with an inclined face of constant slope chwang 1978 also derived the exact solution for the hydrodynamic pressure on a rigid dam with an inclined face of constant slope based on the two dimensional potential flow theory the results indicated that there is a reasonable agreement between these two methods furthermore mei et al 1979 derived exact analytical solutions for simple elastic structures vibrating in water by utilizing the beam theory chopra 1967 derived an analytical expression for the hydrodynamic pressure on a rigid dam considering water compressibility in addition analytical solutions for hydrodynamic pressures on circular cylinders li and yang 2013 liaw and chopra 1974 elliptical cylinders wang et al 2018a and a uniform vertical cylinder with an arbitrary smooth cross section wang et al 2018b were also obtained the numerical method can be used for water structure interaction problems with complex two and three dimensional geometries during earthquakes this analysis model including water and structure has been widely applied to the dam water interaction fenves and chopra 1984 hall and chopra 1980 and the cylinder water interaction wang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 liaw and chopra 1975 it is common to encounter infinitely large water domains for linearized water structure interaction problems which may be a source of difficulty when using discrete numerical methods it should be noted that discretizing a large domain is uneconomical because the element size is limited by wavelength a better idea is to divide the water domain into near and far fields in which the complicated structures are confined in the near field and the analytical representations are used in the far field with the governing equations and the boundary conditions at infinity satisfied this is one kind of hybrid element method and it has been successfully applied to two dimensional radiation problems mei and chen 1976 mei et al 1979 and three dimensional radiation problems wang et al 2018b 2019 the boundary element method tsai and lee 1987a 1987b 1989 1990 1991 the thin layer method tassoulas and kausel 1983 and high order accurate artificial boundary conditions in time domains du and zhao 2010a du and zhao 2010b zhao et al 2011 2018 2018 zhao et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 gao et al 2011 are also used to simulate the far field of the water domain recently the scaled boundary finite element method sbfem has been widely used to solve the wave radiation problems of the unbounded domain the sbfem is a semi analytical technique developed by song and wolf 1996 for the dynamics of unbounded domains from the consistent infinitesimal finite element cell method song and wolf 1997 the sbfem combines the advantages of the finite element method and the boundary element method but no fundamental solution is required the sbfem was first presented to calculate the hyperbolic parabolic and elliptic problem for unbounded and bounded media song and wolf 1998 wolf 2003 song 2018 for wave diffraction and radiation problems in layer shaped unbounded media li et al 2005a 2005b presented a modified sbfem then lin et al 2012 extended this modified sbfem to solve the hydrodynamic pressure on the rigid gravity 2d and arch 3d dams by introducing a vertical truncation boundary to simulate the infinite water domain wang et al 2015 used the sbfem to deal with the hydrodynamic problems of the finite domain and the modified sbfem to deal with the infinity domain in addition prempramote 2016 used the modified sbfem to deal with a high frequency open boundary for the transient seepage analysis at present no work applies the modified sbfem at the general shape water structure interface to replace the infinite water and couple with fem of structure to analyse the hydrodynamic pressures and structural responses in this study a substructure model coupling the modified sbfem with fem is presented to analyse the seismic response of water structure interaction system where the interface of water structure can be general shape the proposed substructure model is applied to investigate the effects of hydrodynamic pressure water compressibility and structure geometry on the seismic responses of offshore structures and gravity dams 2 mathematical formulation as shown in fig 1 a water structure interaction system such as a breakwater or a dam with a generally shaped water structure interface can be simplified as a two dimensional model in which the structure extends from the water bottom up to the surface along the y axis the vertical height of the structure is h and the water depth h h the foundation is assumed to be rigid and the earthquake excitation is assumed to vibrate along the x direction assuming the water is linearly compressible and inviscid the hydrodynamic pressure distribution is governed by the wave equation in the cartesian coordinate system the governed equation is written as tsai and lee 1991 1 2 p x y t 1 c 2 p x y t

denote the derivative with respect to time the interface s i boundary condition which represents the compatibility between the hydrodynamic pressures and the normal displacements at the interface can be written as 2 p n ρ w u n where n represents the outward normal to the interface p n is the normal derivative of the hydrodynamic pressure at the interface s i u n is the total normal displacement of the particles at the interface s i which is equal to the total normal absolute displacement of the structure at the interface and ρ w 1000 kg m3 represents the density of water the surface s b boundary condition at the floor of the water is written as 3 p y 0 the surface s f boundary condition at the free surface of the water is written as 4 p 0 3 modified sbfem for the infinite water layer 3 1 the scaled boundary transformation of geometry the coordinate system of the sbfem rigorously requires that the scaling centre must exist therefore it cannot be used in an unbounded domain with parallel side faces to eliminate the problem the scaling centre is located at infinity along the horizontal axis li et al 2005a in this study the modified sbfem is extended to an arbitrary shaped boundary in the water structure interaction during an earthquake and the boundary is in line with the interface s i in modelling a semi infinite layer the scaling centre o is assumed to be located at infinity li et al 2005a prempramote 2016 as shown in fig 2 for each element the scaled boundary transformation of geometry is shown in fig 2 b the radial ξ axis is in the same direction as the x axis

p e f e 0 all the strip elements equations applying the continuity conditions for the hydrodynamic and the interlayer tractions are assembled applying the boundary conditions at the top and bottom of

0 e 1 e 2 and m 0 are matrices constructed by assembling e 0 e e 1 e e 2 e and m 0 e respectively p is the vector containing p e in the frequency domain and ω is the circular frequency it is readily seen that the solution of equation 23 can be expressed as 24 p δ e i k ξ where i is the imaginary unit the eigenvalue k is the wave number and δ is the amplitude of the hydrodynamic pressure p substituting equation 24 into equation 23 the generalized eigenvalue equation can be obtained as 25 k 2 e 0 i k e 1 t e 1 e 2 ω 2 m 0 δ 0 this is a quadratic eigenvalue problem the solution of which

tassoulas and kausel 1983 all obtained eigenvalues and eigenvectors form the diagonal eigenvalue matrix k d i a g k l and eigenvector matrix x consisting of δ l then the hydrodynamic pressure can be expressed as 27 p x e x γ where e x exp i ξ k and γ is an undetermined vector 3 3 nodal forces and dynamic stiffness the nodal forces on the interface nodes need to be evaluated the normal derivative of pressure on the interface s i e can be denoted as 28 p n n p 2 j δ x 2 δ y 2 b 1 t b 1 p ξ b 2 p η substituting equation 17 into equation 28 and using equation 21 to obtain the element nodal force r e n t p n d s ξ and then assembling the result lead to the nodal force as 29 r e 0 p ξ e 1 t p substituting equation 27 into equation 29 and then combining the result and equation 27 to eliminate e

transforming the boundary condition equation 2 into a frequency domain we get 31 p n ω 2 ρ w u n it can be seen that the left side of this equation is identical to the denoted traction in equation 28 then applying the finite element discretization to equation 31 the nodal forces vector is obtained as follows 32 r ω 2 ρ w t n u where t n is assembled by n t n n d s ξ j b 1 t n d η along the

rigid structure interface under a unit load is used to verify the accuracy of the extended sbfem method as shown in fig 3 three different water structure interfaces including vertical inclined and a typical gravity dam are considered and the size of a typical gravity dam is selected from tsai and lee 1991 as shown in fig 3a and b and c for the vertical and inclined model y a h y b h 2 and y c 0 and for the typical gravity dam y a 60 m y b 20 m and y c 0 are selected as viewpoints the inclined model with θ 60 75 a n d 85 is used for verification where θ is the inclination angle of breakwater defined in fig 3 b for the vertical model selecting an analytical expression as the reference fenves and chopra 1984b the hydrodynamic pressure at the viewpoints is shown in fig 4 a and the hydrodynamic pressure for different mesh sizes is shown in fig 4 b it is obvious that the hydrodynamic pressures agree well with the reference solutions and the mesh size of δ y 5 agrees better than δ y 5 thus the mesh size is selected as δ y 2 for the following calculations fig 5 shows the comparison between the hydrodynamic pressure on the inclined interface with different inclination obtained by sbfem and that obtained by fem fig 6 shows the hydrodynamic pressure distribution on the vertical interface and inclined interface with θ 75 fig 7 shows comparison between the hydrodynamic pressure on the general dam obtained by sbfem and fem the reference solution hall and chopra 1980 is obtained by extended fem that taking the finite water large enough to prevent any reflection from the truncation boundary in figs 5 7 where ω 1 c 4 h is the fundamental frequency of the water it is obvious that the accuracy of this method is high because the sbfem reduces the spatial dimension by one the computational efficiency is greatly improved as shown in fig 6 the hydrodynamic pressure distribution over the structure interface can be influenced by the structure s geometry and seismic frequency 4 coupled with structure fem 4 1 theoretical formula applying the standard galerkin finite element discretization zienkiewicz et al 2008 to the structure the lumped mass finite element

ground respectively m s c s and k s represent the symmetrical mass damping and stiffness matrices respectively f represents the vector of hydrodynamic forces acting on the water structure interface of the structure and u g represents the ground motion taking the fourier transform to equation 34 it can be rewritten into the frequency domain as 35 ω 2 m s u s i ω c s u s k s u s ω 2 m s u g f where u s and f are the fourier transformations of u s and f in the frequency domain respectively at the water structure interface it is obvious that 36 f t n t p substituting equations 36 and 33 into equation 35 the coupled equation is obtained as 37 ω 2 m s u s i ω c s u s k s u s ω 2 m s u g ω 2 s u s u g where s t n s 4 2 model verification to test and verify the effectiveness of the proposed

half reservoir are calculated and the displacement and acceleration time histories on the top of the structure are shown in fig 12 it is obvious that the water increased the response of the dam especially when the reservoir is full the water structure interaction should be considered in dam reservoir systems 5 2 breakwater the seismic responses of elastic breakwaters surrounded by water are analysed to study the influence of vertical and inclined interfaces the models are shown in fig 8 the parameters including the density the young s modulus and the damping ratio are 2500 kg m3 30 gpa and 0 02 respectively the acceleration of the ground motion is shown in figs 11 b and fig 13 in which the seven earthquake records are expressed as no 1 no 2 no 3 no 4 no 5 no 6 and no 7 the peak acceleration is 0 2 g in this study in this section the response at point a as shown in fig 8 is selected as the viewpoint first the effect of water compressibility on the seismic response of the water structure interaction with vertical interface is studied the width of the breakwater is b 10 m and the reservoir is full with h h the dimensionless parameters are introduced as r u u cmax u i max and r a a cmax a i max where u cmax and a cmax are the peak displacement and acceleration with compressible water at viewpoint a and u i max and a i max are the corresponding peak displacement and acceleration with incompressible water respectively fig 14 shows the effect of water compressibility on the seismic response of the water structure interaction with vertical interface it can be seen that water compressibility cannot be neglected in the seismic response analysis of the water structure interaction second the effect of the compressible water depth on the seismic response of the water structure interaction is studied the sizes of the breakwater are is b 10 m θ 80 and h 40 m respectively the dimensionless parameters are introduced as r u u max u 0 max and r a a max a 0 max where u max and a max are the peak displacement and the acceleration with water at viewpoint a and u 0 max and a 0 max are the corresponding peak displacement and acceleration with the structure in air figs 15 and 16 show the effect of the water depth on the water structure interaction system with vertical and inclined interface respectively it can be seen that the seismic responses increase as the water depth increases third the effects of the structure width of the vertical structure and the inclination angle of the inclined structure on the seismic response of the compressible water structure interaction are studied the height of the structure and the dimensionless parameters are same as above paragraph figs 17 and 18 show the trend of the water effect with different geometric structures and the trend line is the linear regression analysis fig 19 shows the seismic response peak with different inclination angles with water depths equal to 20 m and 40 m as shown in fig 17 the effect of the water decreases as the structure width increases furthermore as shown in fig 18 the effect of the water increases as the inclination angle increases it is obvious in fig 19 that the dynamic responses including displacement and acceleration amplitude decrease as the inclination angle decreases it can also be seen that the peak responses decrease dramatically as the inclination angle decreases from 90 to 85 and this tendency slows down as the inclination angle decreases from 85 to 75 however the peak responses are almost invariable when the inclination angle is less than 75 it should be noted that for a breakwater with the same width b the consumption cost of the breakwater increases as the inclination angle decreases therefore to ensure both economy and security the inclination angle of the breakwater can be selected from within the range of 75 85 then the frequency responses of the breakwater with an inclination angle equal to 80 are analysed the width of the breakwater is b 10 m fig 20 a and b shows the hydrodynamic pressure on the foot point of the rigid breakwater and flexible breakwater respectively fig 21 shows the displacement at the top of the breakwater with different water depths fig 22 shows the hydrodynamic pressure distribution on the breakwater interface with h 20 m 30 m and 40 m which the breakwater are assumed as rigid and flexible respectively in figs 20 and 21 ω 1 c 4 h is the fundamental frequency of the water and ω c is the fundamental frequency of the breakwater water system it can be seen that the water structure interaction decreases the natural frequency of the structures and this influence increases as the water depth increases it should be noted that the hydrodynamic pressures caused by the flexible deformation of the breakwater are significantly large when the seismic frequencies are close to the natural frequencies of the water and structure in addition the hydrodynamic pressure distribution on the structure interface may be quite different when the water depth and the seismic frequency are changed 6 conclusions a substructure method is proposed to analyse the water structure interaction problem under earthquake action that considers the elasticity of the structure and compressible water the water of an infinitely layered domain is simulated by the modified sbfem coupled with the fem for structure the seismic response of the water structure system can be computed the proposed substructure method is applied to analyse the water structure interaction system the seismic responses of a typical gravity dam and breakwaters with different sizes and water depths are investigated the effect of water compressibility on the seismic responses of offshore structures is also studied the results show that the water structure interaction increases the seismic responses of the structures and decreases the natural frequency of the structure this influence increases as the water depth increases and it will be quite different when the structure size such as the width of the structure and the inclination angle of water structure interface is changed it can also be concluded that the water compressibility should be considered to ensure both economy and security the inclination angle of the breakwater is recommended to be in the range of 75 85 it should be noted that the above

22501,the seismic responses of offshore structures and dams can be affected by the water structure interaction the structures are commonly modelled by finite element method fem if the infinite water layer is also modelled by fem then the computational costs are high in this paper an accurate and efficient substructure method is presented in a frequency domain for a 2d water structure interaction analysis in which the modified scaled boundary finite element method sbfem is applied at a general shaped water structure interface to replace the compressible water layer several numerical examples including offshore structures and a typical geometry gravity dam are provided to demonstrate the computational efficiency and accuracy of the proposed substructure method the effects of hydrodynamic pressure water compressibility and structure geometry on the seismic responses of offshore structures are analysed based on the proposed method keywords offshore structure scaled boundary finite element method substructure method general interface shape earthquake 1 introduction an earthquake analysis of offshore structures such as breakwaters and artificial islands and dam reservoir systems requires special considerations due to the water structure interaction it is well known that earthquakes can produce additional hydrodynamic pressures on structures in water hydrodynamic pressure can modify the seismic response and dynamic properties of the structure wei et al 2013 han and xu 1996 liaw and chopra 1974 the research on hydrodynamic pressure began with the gravity dam conducted by westergaard 1933 and the cylindrical tank by jacobsen 1949 the analytical method can be used to solve the hydrodynamic pressure on structures during earthquakes with a simple geometry such as a straight gravity dam westergaard 1933 first derived the analytical solution for the hydrodynamic pressure on a straight dam due to earthquake ground motions in which the dam was assumed to be rigid and the water was assumed to be incompressible based on the momentum balance method chwang and housner 1978 presented an explicit analytical formula for the hydrodynamic pressure on a rigid dam with an inclined face of constant slope chwang 1978 also derived the exact solution for the hydrodynamic pressure on a rigid dam with an inclined face of constant slope based on the two dimensional potential flow theory the results indicated that there is a reasonable agreement between these two methods furthermore mei et al 1979 derived exact analytical solutions for simple elastic structures vibrating in water by utilizing the beam theory chopra 1967 derived an analytical expression for the hydrodynamic pressure on a rigid dam considering water compressibility in addition analytical solutions for hydrodynamic pressures on circular cylinders li and yang 2013 liaw and chopra 1974 elliptical cylinders wang et al 2018a and a uniform vertical cylinder with an arbitrary smooth cross section wang et al 2018b were also obtained the numerical method can be used for water structure interaction problems with complex two and three dimensional geometries during earthquakes this analysis model including water and structure has been widely applied to the dam water interaction fenves and chopra 1984 hall and chopra 1980 and the cylinder water interaction wang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 liaw and chopra 1975 it is common to encounter infinitely large water domains for linearized water structure interaction problems which may be a source of difficulty when using discrete numerical methods it should be noted that discretizing a large domain is uneconomical because the element size is limited by wavelength a better idea is to divide the water domain into near and far fields in which the complicated structures are confined in the near field and the analytical representations are used in the far field with the governing equations and the boundary conditions at infinity satisfied this is one kind of hybrid element method and it has been successfully applied to two dimensional radiation problems mei and chen 1976 mei et al 1979 and three dimensional radiation problems wang et al 2018b 2019 the boundary element method tsai and lee 1987a 1987b 1989 1990 1991 the thin layer method tassoulas and kausel 1983 and high order accurate artificial boundary conditions in time domains du and zhao 2010a du and zhao 2010b zhao et al 2011 2018 2018 zhao et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 gao et al 2011 are also used to simulate the far field of the water domain recently the scaled boundary finite element method sbfem has been widely used to solve the wave radiation problems of the unbounded domain the sbfem is a semi analytical technique developed by song and wolf 1996 for the dynamics of unbounded domains from the consistent infinitesimal finite element cell method song and wolf 1997 the sbfem combines the advantages of the finite element method and the boundary element method but no fundamental solution is required the sbfem was first presented to calculate the hyperbolic parabolic and elliptic problem for unbounded and bounded media song and wolf 1998 wolf 2003 song 2018 for wave diffraction and radiation problems in layer shaped unbounded media li et al 2005a 2005b presented a modified sbfem then lin et al 2012 extended this modified sbfem to solve the hydrodynamic pressure on the rigid gravity 2d and arch 3d dams by introducing a vertical truncation boundary to simulate the infinite water domain wang et al 2015 used the sbfem to deal with the hydrodynamic problems of the finite domain and the modified sbfem to deal with the infinity domain in addition prempramote 2016 used the modified sbfem to deal with a high frequency open boundary for the transient seepage analysis at present no work applies the modified sbfem at the general shape water structure interface to replace the infinite water and couple with fem of structure to analyse the hydrodynamic pressures and structural responses in this study a substructure model coupling the modified sbfem with fem is presented to analyse the seismic response of water structure interaction system where the interface of water structure can be general shape the proposed substructure model is applied to investigate the effects of hydrodynamic pressure water compressibility and structure geometry on the seismic responses of offshore structures and gravity dams 2 mathematical formulation as shown in fig 1 a water structure interaction system such as a breakwater or a dam with a generally shaped water structure interface can be simplified as a two dimensional model in which the structure extends from the water bottom up to the surface along the y axis the vertical height of the structure is h and the water depth h h the foundation is assumed to be rigid and the earthquake excitation is assumed to vibrate along the x direction assuming the water is linearly compressible and inviscid the hydrodynamic pressure distribution is governed by the wave equation in the cartesian coordinate system the governed equation is written as tsai and lee 1991 1 2 p x y t 1 c 2 p x y t

be written as 2 p n ρ w u n where n represents the outward normal to the interface p n is the normal derivative of the hydrodynamic pressure at the interface s i u n is the total normal displacement of the particles at the interface s i which is equal to the total normal absolute displacement of the structure at the interface and ρ w 1000 kg m3 represents the density of water the surface s b boundary condition at the floor of the water is written as 3 p y 0 the surface s f boundary condition at the free surface of the water is written as 4 p 0 3 modified sbfem for the infinite water layer 3 1 the scaled boundary transformation of geometry the coordinate system of the sbfem rigorously requires that the scaling centre must exist therefore it cannot be used in an unbounded domain with parallel side faces to eliminate the problem the scaling centre is located at infinity along the horizontal axis li et al 2005a in this study the modified sbfem is extended to an arbitrary shaped boundary in the water structure interaction during an earthquake and the boundary is in line with the interface s i in modelling a semi infinite layer the scaling centre o is assumed to be located at infinity li et al 2005a prempramote 2016 as shown in fig 2 for each element the scaled boundary transformation of geometry is shown in fig 2 b the radial ξ axis is in the same direction as the x axis

p e f e 0 all the strip elements equations applying the continuity conditions for the hydrodynamic and the interlayer tractions are assembled applying the boundary conditions at the top and bottom of the stratum then they are fourier transformed into frequency domain and the homogeneous differential equation for the entire system can be obtained 23 e 0 p ξ ξ e 1 t e 1 p ξ e 2 p ω 2 m 0 p 0 where e 0 e 1 e 2 and m 0 are matrices constructed by assembling e 0 e e 1 e e 2 e and m 0 e respectively p is the vector containing p e in the frequency domain and ω is the circular frequency it is readily seen that the solution of equation 23 can be expressed as 24 p δ e i k ξ where i is the imaginary unit the eigenvalue k is the wave number and δ is the amplitude of the hydrodynamic pressure p substituting equation 24 into equation 23 the generalized eigenvalue equation can be obtained as 25 k 2 e 0 i k e 1 t e 1 e 2 ω 2 m 0 δ 0 this is a quadratic eigenvalue problem the solution of which

tassoulas and kausel 1983 all obtained eigenvalues and eigenvectors form the diagonal eigenvalue matrix k d i a g k l and eigenvector matrix x consisting of δ l then the hydrodynamic pressure can be expressed as 27 p x e x γ where e x exp i ξ k and γ is an undetermined vector 3 3 nodal forces and dynamic stiffness the nodal forces on the interface nodes need to be evaluated the normal derivative of pressure on the interface s i e can be denoted as 28 p n n p 2 j δ x 2 δ y 2 b 1 t b 1 p ξ b 2 p η substituting equation 17 into equation 28 and using equation 21 to obtain the element nodal force r e n t p n d s ξ and then assembling the result lead to the nodal force as 29 r e 0 p ξ e 1 t p substituting equation 27 into equation 29 and then combining the result and equation 27 to eliminate e

transforming the boundary condition equation 2 into a frequency domain we get 31 p n ω 2 ρ w u n it can be seen that the left side of this equation is identical to the denoted traction in equation 28 then applying the finite element discretization to equation 31 the nodal forces vector is obtained as follows 32 r ω 2 ρ w t n u where t n is assembled by n t n n d s ξ j b 1 t n d η along the

rigid structure interface under a unit load is used to verify the accuracy of the extended sbfem method as shown in fig 3 three different water structure interfaces including vertical inclined and a typical gravity dam are considered and the size of a typical gravity dam is selected from tsai and lee 1991 as shown in fig 3a and b and c for the vertical and inclined model y a h y b h 2 and y c 0 and for the typical gravity dam y a 60 m y b 20 m and y c 0 are selected as viewpoints the inclined model with θ 60 75 a n d 85 is used for verification where θ is the inclination angle of breakwater defined in fig 3 b for the vertical model selecting an analytical expression as the reference fenves and chopra 1984b the hydrodynamic pressure at the viewpoints is shown in fig 4 a and the hydrodynamic pressure for different mesh sizes is shown in fig 4 b it is obvious that the hydrodynamic pressures agree well with the reference solutions and the mesh size of δ y 5 agrees better than δ y 5 thus the mesh size is selected as δ y 2 for the following calculations fig 5 shows the comparison between the hydrodynamic pressure on the inclined interface with different inclination obtained by sbfem and that obtained by fem fig 6 shows the hydrodynamic pressure distribution on the vertical interface and inclined interface with θ 75 fig 7 shows comparison between the hydrodynamic pressure on the general dam obtained by sbfem and fem the reference solution hall and chopra 1980 is obtained by extended fem that taking the finite water large enough to prevent any reflection from the truncation boundary in figs 5 7 where ω 1 c 4 h is the fundamental frequency of the water it is obvious that the accuracy of this method is high because the sbfem reduces the spatial dimension by one the computational efficiency is greatly improved as shown in fig 6 the hydrodynamic pressure distribution over the structure interface can be influenced by the structure s geometry and seismic frequency 4 coupled with structure fem 4 1 theoretical formula applying the standard galerkin finite element discretization zienkiewicz et al 2008 to the structure the lumped mass finite element

ground respectively m s c s and k s represent the symmetrical mass damping and stiffness matrices respectively f represents the vector of hydrodynamic forces acting on the water structure interface of the structure and u g represents the ground motion taking the fourier transform to equation 34 it can be rewritten into the frequency domain as 35 ω 2 m s u s i ω c s u s k s u s ω 2 m s u g f where u s and f are the fourier transformations of u s and f in the frequency domain respectively at the water structure interface it is obvious that 36 f t n t p substituting equations 36 and 33 into equation 35 the coupled equation is obtained as 37 ω 2 m s u s i ω c s u s k s u s ω 2 m s u g ω 2 s u s u g where s t n s 4 2 model verification to test and verify the effectiveness of the proposed

structures and the trend line is the linear regression analysis fig 19 shows the seismic response peak with different inclination angles with water depths equal to 20 m and 40 m as shown in fig 17 the effect of the water decreases as the structure width increases furthermore as shown in fig 18 the effect of the water increases as the inclination angle increases it is obvious in fig 19 that the dynamic responses including displacement and acceleration amplitude decrease as the inclination angle decreases it can also be seen that the peak responses decrease dramatically as the inclination angle decreases from 90 to 85 and this tendency slows down as the inclination angle decreases from 85 to 75 however the peak responses are almost invariable when the inclination angle is less than 75 it should be noted that for a breakwater with the same width b the consumption cost of the breakwater increases as the inclination angle decreases therefore to ensure both economy and security the inclination angle of the breakwater can be selected from within the range of 75 85 then the frequency responses of the breakwater with an inclination angle equal to 80 are analysed the width of the breakwater is b 10 m fig 20 a and b shows the hydrodynamic pressure on the foot point of the rigid breakwater and flexible breakwater respectively fig 21 shows the displacement at the top of the

respectively in figs 20 and 21 ω 1 c 4 h is the fundamental frequency of the water and ω c is the fundamental frequency of the breakwater water system it can be seen that the water structure interaction decreases the natural frequency of the structures and this influence increases as the water depth increases it should be noted that the hydrodynamic pressures caused by the flexible deformation of the breakwater are significantly large when the seismic frequencies are close to the natural frequencies of the water and structure in addition the hydrodynamic pressure distribution on the structure interface may be quite different when the water depth and the seismic frequency are changed 6 conclusions a substructure method is proposed to analyse the water structure interaction problem under earthquake action that considers the elasticity of the structure and compressible water the water of an infinitely layered domain is simulated by the modified sbfem coupled with the fem

evolution of wake vortices and their interaction with projectiles are studied under various launcher transport speed and launch sequences two major wake vortex structures are discovered the vortex ring and the counter rotating vortex pair as the projectile angle of attack increases the dominant vortex inside the wake transforms from vortex rings to hairpin vortices then counter rotating vortex pairs the large scale vortices in the wake are highly directional before breaking up and the counter rotating vortex pairs can impose significant influence on projectile attitude upon wake vortex

firstly studied by lanchester 1915 wake vortex has caused many disasters in history and severely limited the capacity of airports this kind of vortex also trails behind vehicles submerged in water saeidinezhad and dehghan 2015 its influence on follow up underwater vehicles however is still mostly unexplored nowadays with increasing demand on vertical launching capacity of submarines a systematic study on the effect and mechanism of wake vortex encounter underwater can be useful for submarine vertical launch systems vls substantial research has been conducted on the launching of a single projectile since most of these projectiles are ejected by high pressure gas at shallow water cavitation is usually inevitable this phenomenon attracted the attention of many researchers in the past decade wang and huang 2018 reviews recent studies on the hydrodynamics of high speed vehicles launched underwater and regards unsteady cavitation as significant in the launching process he argues that both the content of and the research method for high speed underwater launching problems are beyond the scope of classical hydrodynamics new methods explicitly targeting the evolution stability and collapse of the cavity for high speed vehicles shall be established to understand the process thoroughly wei et al 2009 studies the vertical launching of a single projectile numerically utilizing dynamic mesh method with one degree of freedom both gravity and cavitation are concerned in this study relationship between the cavitation number and the drag coefficient of the projectile is discussed wang also conducts several depressurized experiments for cavitation number similarity and a new internal collapse phenomenon is discovered wang et al 2016 2012 xue et al 2016 studies the ventilated gas bubble attached to an underwater vehicle under gravity field using potential theory and boundary element method bem it shows gravity has considerable influence on bubble shape and ventilation jet direction under certain combinations of froude and cavitation numbers sun et al 2019b a studies the ventilated partial cavitating flow around an underwater vehicle at the development stage by increasing the ventilation rate the partial cavity is found to be dynamically more stable wang et al 2014 studies cavitation during the water exit phase through numerical and experimental methods the study focuses on the collapse of cavity bubbles and its coupling effect with the dynamic response of the structure bending fracture is found to be the major potential damage form caused by cavity collapse apart from the shoulder cavity dyment et al 1998 thoroughly studies tail cavities at the base of underwater projectiles asymptotic analysis is used to yield similarity parameters both experimental and numerical methods are used to examine the stretching of cavities the study also discusses the problem from the aspects of thermodynamics ma et al 2018a b c 2019 conducts a thorough study on projectiles launched with moving platforms the characteristics of the gaseous pressure equalizing film and its effect on the projectile trajectory and attitude stability are numerically studied in his research the hydro ballistic uncertainty of these projectiles caused by platform transport speed and yaw position are also studied using chaos theory jo et al 2018 establishes a surface pressure prediction method for underwater projectiles based on genetic algorithm and a dataset generated by cfd they calculated the movement of projectiles with 6 degrees of freedom utilizing unstructured overset mesh and the spalart allmaras one equation turbulence model the study shows that the projectile escaping velocity and the platform transport velocity significantly affects the surface pressure characteristics of projectiles by causing vortices in the flow field weiland et al 2010 discusses a novel method of launching by water piercing via high speed gaseous jets the formation and characteristics of the gaseous jet path are studied but without considering the behaviour of projectiles however until now there are few published papers on the successive launch of multiple projectiles li 2018 conducts an experimental study on the launching of two projectiles with various platform transport speed and time interval his research focuses mainly on the phenomenons observed in experiments but lacks discussion on the mechanism the discoveries in his work however shows the necessity of an in depth study on this topic while cavitation plays a vital role in underwater launching and projectile water exit behaviour the successive launch of such projectiles can be dominated by other factors as well as in aviation the wake turbulence trailing behind submerged projectiles can play an essential role in limiting the launching capacity of submarines plenty of research focused on these wake flows in the past decades bridges and hornung 1994 experimentally studies the influence of an elliptic cross section tip on the vortex wake of antisymmetric bodies at incidence in a water tunnel the tip is found to be effective in varying the vortex wake geometry of a right circular cone at a large angle of attack saeidineshad conducts an experimental research on the hydrodynamic and wake vortex characteristics of a submerged vehicle saeidinezhad et al 2015 saeidinezhad and dehghan 2015 different nose shapes both axial symmetric and asymmetric are compared planar laser induced fluorescence plif is implemented to reveal the vortex structure the study shows that the location of flow separation for the non axisymmetric nose shape is closer to the tip than the symmetric ones at a high angle of attack a pair of stream wise vortices that are asymmetric in strength is observed in the turbulent wake of an axisymmetric darpa suboff submarine model in yaw in wind tunnel experiments by ashok et al 2015b with stereoscopic piv the weaker vortex quickly diffuses in these experiments but the stronger vortex maintains its strength quite far downstream for lack of further diffusion asymmetry is found in the wake of the submarine model even without a yaw angle ashok et al 2015a a pair of counter rotating vortices is observed and the clockwise vortex is found to be approximately 10 to 20 stronger than the counter clockwise vortex for wake vortices generated without incidence a large eddy simulation is executed by kumar and mahesh 2018 at a reynolds number of r e 1 1 1 0 6 the study stated that the thin hull boundary layer and long wake development length are the two decisive challenges of wake turbulence simulation for streamlined bodies for higher reynolds numbers from 1 1 1 0 6 to 67 1 0 6 a wind tunnel study is conducted by jiménez et al 2010 on the intermediate wake of a large scale axial symmetric vehicle the free surface effects on the turbulent wake of a surface piercing body are studied with a towed underwater piv by seol et al 2013 strong interaction between the wake and the free surface wave is observed at f r 0 4 jimenez et al 2010 studied the effects of fins on the turbulent wake behind a submarine model for r e from 0 49 1 0 6 to 1 8 1 0 6 they conclude that the fins create defects in velocity in the outer region of the wake and generate higher values of turbulence at fin tips nevertheless the vertical launching capacity of a submarine is not only limited by the presence of wake turbulence but also the operational scenario different launch patterns for example can be applied to avoid direct wake vortex encounter wve in order to evaluate the potential hazard of wve underwater direct and quantitative studies shall be conducted since few published papers focus on this aspect of the underwater vertical launch advanced research is essential in understanding the underlying phenomena and their mechanisms being relatively low cost and detailed in results numerical simulation utilizing the rans turbulent models is the best option for such study the presented study on the wake flow of slender axial symmetric projectiles launched successively underwater with different launch sequences and launcher transport velocities indicates that the outcome of second projectiles passing through the wake of the previous is potentially favourable to projectile attitude stability but also highly unpredictable when encountering with strong counter rotating cylindrical vortices we present the numerical set up and operational scenarios in section 2 along with dimensionless number definition and numerical result verification validation section 3 discusses the interaction between projectiles and tail vortices under different operational scenarios finally the conclusions are presented in section 4 2 simulation details 2 1 cfd geometry and operational scenario fig 1 shows the geometry and the boundary conditions of the simulation two projectiles are launched successively underwater at a depth of 10 m muzzle hatches are not included in the simulation but gas seals are preserved to prevent leakage during launch the transport velocity of the launch platform u is in the x negative direction the relative flow velocity caused by platform transport velocity therefore in the opposite two launch sequences are studied upwind launch sequence uls and downwind launch sequence dls in fig 1 projectile b is launched first then projectile a as the second with a time interval of δ t this procedure in which the projectile downstream is launched first is defined as the uls the dls is defined as the opposite since the gap between most of the 7 barrel vls tubes is 0 3 times tube diameter the spatial interval between the launch tubes axis h is set to be 1 3 d and the centre of these tubes be within the longitudinal symmetry plane the motion of the projectiles is simulated with 6dofs upon separating from the launch tube only 1dof along the y axis is simulated while inside projectiles are ejected with high pressure gas therefore the bottom of the launch tubes has a stagnation pressure inlet boundary condition in order to simulate the gas recycle process during practical launch the magnitude of pressure inlet inside the tube varies with time and drops to deck level right on projectile separation since most of the projectiles launched by modern submarines have a slenderness ratio around 5 to 12 m51 trident ii tomahawk 3m 54 a median value of 8 is used in the presented study for generality with 0 1 m in diameter the length of the projectiles is set to be 0 8 m the projectiles have ellipsoid heads with a compression factor of 3 we assume mass distributes uniformly inside these projectiles with a density of 2000 kg m 3 the distance from the centre of mass to the tip of the projectile l c is 0 5 l and the principal moment of inertia about this mass centre is 0 567 0 014 0 567 kg m 2 in order to maximize the potential hazard of wve underwater the launch time interval between projectiles under dls are set to be δ t l v e h u with v e 7 0 m s and u 1 0 m s the corresponding dimensionless time interval δ t mentioned later is then 2 15 under this time interval the head of the second projectile is expected to be right in the wake of the first projectile upon clearing the launch tube for uls two time intervals are studied with δ t 2 l v e and δ t l v e and the corresponding dimensionless time intervals to be δ t 2 0 and 1 0 since the second projectile under uls is unlikely to experience wve a shorter time interval is applied for comparison 2 2 dimensionless numbers in order to extend the utility of this study all quantities mentioned in this paper are dimensionless unless explicitly specified the problem studied is an initial boundary value problem and can be put into the form 1 f t δ t u p p g ρ w ρ g μ w g l d l c h x y v θ ψ ω z 0 the fundamental physical quantities are projectile length l projectile tube exit speed v e and water

variables studied in this paper e u σ t ρ g ρ w account for the compressibility of high pressure gas inside the launch tube and the development of cavity bubble at tube muzzle σ t also controls the projectile tube exit speed v e the location of the mass centre profoundly affect the behaviour of projectiles and is represented by l c l with a value of 0 5 meaning the projectiles are statically unstable while travelling underwater nature cavitation is ignored in this study because the projectiles are assumed to be launched at a depth with p 200 kpa in absolute pressure with a cavitation number larger than 20 the values for controlled variables in formula 3 are listed in table 1 2 3 numerical method the presented study is performed with commercial cfd code star ccm cd adapco 2017 the major physical phenomena modelled include multiphase flow compressibility turbulence wall boundary separation and gravity for muzzle bubble simulation and interface capturing a euler euler approach is implemented with the volume of fluid vof method the energy equation is included to predict the behaviour of these bubbles correctly and the ideal gas model is assigned to the gas phase no compressibility of water is included the projectiles have a reynolds number of around 5 1 0 6 upon separation therefore in the regime of turbulent flow the realizable k ϵ model is used for turbulence simulation and the transition of turbulent flow around the projectile is ignored a gravity of 9 8 m s 2 is also applied in the y negative direction as the only code to officially support wall boundary separation with overset mesh methodology star ccm offers a zero gap interface type for treatment of wall boundary interception and overlap the global approach is selected for zero gap interface during the hole cutting process alongside the close proximity option the linear interpolation method is chosen for data communication between the overset and background region a demonstration of the overset mesh and the unstructured polyhedron cell type used in this study is shown in fig 2a the basic cell size around the projectiles in both background and overset mesh regions is 0 08 d the sufficiency of this size is quantified later in the simulation verification section a total number of 10 evenly stretched prism layers lie on the surface of projectiles the maxim y of the prism layer is around 100 which is sufficient for the turbulence model used a contour of y on one of the projectiles is shown in fig 2b the simulations were executed on several workstations each mounted with two e 2640 processors 2 4 simulation verification and validation in order to evaluate the degree of accuracy of the numerical simulation a verification and validation effort is made following the instruction of asme v v 20 2009 v v however we have to drop certain requirements in this standard for they are beyond the reach of the presented study the solution validation and mesh independence analysis are performed on three different grid resolutions with a constant refinement factor of 1 3 the grid convergence indicator gci is calculated to estimate the discretization error quantitatively both numerical and experiment uncertainties are concerned in the validation process but not input uncertainty for its expensive cost the criteria proposed by coleman and stern 1997 on the comparison between validation comparison error e and validation uncertainty u v a l is adopted for validation the v v procedure is performed on the launching of a single projectile with u 0 5 f r 7 1 as one of the most concerned parameters during underwater launching pitch attitude θ within vertical displacement 1 y 2 3 is chosen as the validation variable the pitch attitude in this study is defined as the angle between the longitudinal body axis of a projectile and the horizontal plane zx plane as the indicator of correctness numerical uncertainty of the pitch attitude variation δ θ was evaluated through a set of three meshes with n 1 3 31 m n 2 1 42 m n 3 0 69 m by following the five step procedure in v v the grid refinement factor r 21 1 33 and r 21 1 27 were assumed to be constant with a value of r 1 3 this way the apparent order of accuracy p can be derived from 4 p ln δ θ 3 δ θ 2 δ θ 2 δ θ 1 ln r since the presented simulation is time dependent this calculation shall be carried out for each time step between 1 y 2 3 unfortunately due to the high non linearity and the chaotic nature of underwater launching process ma et al 2019 the calculated value of δ θ does not lie in the asymptotic region for y 1 5 that is to say do not converge with increased grid resolution in this interval therefore p was assumed to be 1 0 for uncertainty estimation between 1 0 y 1 5 as suggested v v the extrapolated value of pitch variation was then calculated by 5 δ θ e x t r a p o l a t e r p δ θ 1 δ θ 2 r p 1 for calculation of the numerical uncertainty a conservative factor of safety f s 3 0 was used finally the uncertainty was estimated to be 6 u n u m f s δ θ e x t r a p o l a t e δ θ 1 2 all three sets of δ θ along with the extrapolated δ θ e x t r a p o l a t e are show in fig 3 with u n u m as the uncertainty band for δ θ 1 the experiment for validation was carried out in an open water tank with a high speed camera the projectile used is geometric similar to that used in simulation but of 0 04 m in diameter f r u and σ t are all identical for both simulation and experiment but r e and e u differs a tripwire was placed on the head of the projectile to ensure a turbulent boundary layer a schematic of the experimental set up and the comparison between numerical and experimental results are shown in fig 4 the transport speed of the launch platform was simulated by a drive motor along the x negative direction a photron sa x high speed camera triggered with a laser switch lying across the tank was used to record the motion of the projectile the camera was tuned and calibrated on the xy plane therefore motion in the z direction was ignored a solenoid valve controlled the high pressure ejection gas in the launch tube and the storing gas tank was carried along the launch platform to improve the constancy of ejection pressure all devices are electronically controlled and synchronized with a digital controller to ensure repeatability of the launching process the position and pitch attitude of the projectile in the xy plane was extracted from the images with the assistance of matlab image processing toolbox a total number of five launches were recorded the experimental uncertainty u d of these measurements contains systematic uncertainty b θ and random uncertainty s θ 7 u d b θ 2 s θ 2 the systematic uncertainty of projectile pith measurement b θ includes errors caused by camera calibration against a ruler 0 4 mm and digital image discretization 2 px 1 9 mm px both divided by projectile length 320 mm thus 8 b θ 0 4 mm 2 2 px 1 9 mm px 2 320 mm 0 012 rad the random uncertainty is taken as the standard deviation of pitch attitude measured in all five launches 9 s θ 1 5 i 1 5 δ θ i δ θ the average of the experimental results δ θ e x p e r i m e n t is shown in fig 3 along with the experimental uncertainty u d calculated from formula 7 as uncertainty band in the absence of input uncertainty the validation uncertainty u v a l of δ θ 1 becomes 10 u v a l u n u m 2 u d 2 by computing the validation comparison error e δ θ 1 δ θ e x p e r i m e n t the modelling error of the simulation δ m o d e l shall fall between e u v a l e u v a l with e as its estimation fig 5 shows this estimation of modelling error in pitch attitude with u v a l as the uncertainty band in this figure δ m o d e l is relatively small with values no larger than 0 5 the uncertainty of this estimation however increases sharply between 1 6 y 2 1 form fig 3 we can conclude that this sharp increase mainly comes from u n u m who also experienced a sharp increase at the same interval after y 2 1 the uncertainty of modelling quickly drops to around 0 5 with δ m o d e l slowly increases to the same level table 2 shows the exact value of some validation parameters on the final stage of simulation at y 2 3 with a grid convergence index gci of 8 7 and e of 0 3 2 the final result is proved to be quite valid this contradictory phenomenon indicates the simulation is rather noisy between 1 6 y 2 1 but acquires an adequate level of confidence in final when y 2 2 as another important parameter mentioned by jo et al 2018 the projectile tube exit speed v e under different meshes is also presented in fig 6 we can see from this figure that v e converges asymptotically with higher grid resolution 3 results and discussion 3 1 shedding of tail vortices from first projectiles due to the transport velocity of the launching platform the projectiles exit the launch tube with a certain aoa two types of vortex structures are discovered in the wake due to this aoa a counter rotating vortex pair formed by flow separation at the trailing edge of a projectile with vorticity dominant in the vertical direction and vortex rings shedding from the bottom of the projectile with vorticity dominant in the horizontal direction fig 7a shows these two types of vortices with q criteria iso surfaces at q 1 the shedding of vortex rings is strongly periodic while the formation of the counter rotating vortex pair is relatively continuous this counter rotating vortex pair is also documented by saeidinezhad et al 2015 behind a submarine model at incidence distinguish differences can be found among the wake vortex structure of projectiles launched with different platform transport speed as a comparison between fig 7a and fig 7b reveals different platform transport speed can also be regarded as variations in initial aoa when the transport speed is relatively slow as u 0 07 the wake is mainly filled with vortex rings when the transport speed becomes relatively high as u 0 21 the vortex rings and the counter rotating vortex pairs merge into hairpin vortices the counter rotating vortex pair becomes the leg of the hairpin vortex and the vortex ring rolls up to form the vortex head under low transport speeds the strength of the bottom vortex whose vorticity is mostly along the horizontal direction is higher therefore they can generate closed vortex rings in the wake with the high swirling of these rings the nearby counter rotating cylindrical vortices are broken and entrained into the vortex rings the merging of the cylindrical vortices causes the variation of vorticity in the vortex ring and the ring plane to lean windward as illustrated in fig 8a the apparent change of direction of the ring plane normal can also be discovered from the development of bottom vortex rings in fig 7a when the transport speed is higher the counter rotating vortex pairs with vertical vorticity in dominant tends to be stronger fig 8b is a contour plot of the vorticity magnitude on the vertical and horizontal slice plane of first projectiles under different transport speeds in this figure the strength of the vortex ring shedding from the bottom fades as the transport velocity u increases from 0 07 to 0 21 however the strength of the vortex pair amplifies with a higher u under a transport speed of 0 21 the counter rotating vortex pair is strong enough to break the bottom vortex rings on the leeward side the broken rings merge with the cylindrical vortices on each side of the longitudinal symmetry plane and become the head of the newly formed hairpin vortex these hairpin vortices also inherit the periodicity of vortex rings moreover each of these hairpin vortices is connected successively through legs build up by the counter rotating vortex pairs to form a vortex packet as shown in fig 7b 3 2 hydrodynamic interaction between projectiles under downwind launch sequence all second projectiles experience wake vortex encounter under dls in fig 9a the wake of the first projectile affects the second through several vortex rings on the windward side of second projectiles due to the merging of counter rotating vortex pairs all the vortex rings lean windward toward the flow the high pressure at the tip of the second projectile pushes all the slanting vortex rings upstream as it passes by at the wake of the second projectile the tail vortices of the first and the second projectile strongly interact with each other and break into a great quantity of irregular and much smaller vortices when launched in a downwind sequence the flow field for u 0 07 and u 0 21 are significantly different from each other after the second projectiles has passed through a comparison of these two flow fields are made between fig 9a and fig 9b with a transport speed of u 0 21 the attitude and stability of the second projectile are mostly affected by the continuously distributed counter rotating vortex pair at its leeward side along the axial direction due to a shorter launch interval the second projectile under this transport speed reaches the tail vortices of the first one before they are fully developed these vortices do not break up after the second projectile had passed through but gradually evolved into closed vortex rings apparent differences can be found in the vorticity magnitude and q criteria contour lines between fig 10a and fig 10b when u 0 21 vortex cores characterized by the black q criteria contour lines on the longitudinal symmetry plane in fig 10b are much larger more regular and with higher vorticity strength as for u 0 07 in fig 10a the number of the vortex cores is more significant but their size is smaller than under u 0 21 the vortex flux through these closure lines representing the vortex core strength is also lower when compared with u 0 21 likewise the direction of the dominant momentum in the wake differs under different transport velocities fig 10a and fig 10b shows the tangential velocity vectors calculated within the earth coordinate system at low transport velocities the fluid in the wake of the second projectile moves mainly upward following the motion of the projectile while under a higher transport velocity the aoa of projectiles and the strength of counter rotating vortex pairs at the leeward side of them become higher therefore passing on more horizontal momentum into the fluid and forcing it to move horizontally 3 3 hydrodynamic interaction between projectiles under upwind launch sequence comparing with those under a dls the vortices created by the first projectile under a uls at low transport velocity breaks up earlier fig 11b shows that the tail vortices of the first projectile under uls are also made up mostly with vortex rings due to lower transport velocities however these vortex rings stretch upstream as they evolve and expand when the second projectile passes by from upstream these stretched rings make contact and interact with it by the pitch attitude data below we can conclude that this interaction of vortex rings with the second projectiles do not put much influence on them however the adverse pressure gradient in fig 11c on the lee side of the projectile produces a powerful suction effect to tear the vortices apart affected by this adverse pressure gradient the vortex rings in the wake of the first projectile launched in an upwind sequence under low transport velocities break up earlier than those in a downwind sequence for high transport velocities such as u 0 21 in fig 11 the intensity of counter rotating vortex pairs becomes remarkably stronger as for the vortices shedding from the bottom of the projectile they gradually disappear while the projectile aoa increases during underwater flight finally the hairpin vortices in the wake are replaced by counter rotating vortex pairs for the lack of bottom vortex rings to make up the head the absolute value of the attack angle of a projectile is the smallest when it has just clear the launch muzzle at this initial stage of flight the shedding of vortices is similar to those under low transport velocity likewise the hairpin vortex generated by this shedding has strong vortex heads these heads of the hairpin vortices will finally evolve into separate vortex rings however the vortices shedding from the bottom of projectiles get weaker as the aoa increases continuously during flight therefore the formation of the hairpin vortex head by these vortices stops gradually ultimately the vortices in the wake of these projectiles turned from hairpin vortices into counter rotating cylindrical vortex pair with u 0 21 the speed of the vortices moving downstream is faster than stretching upstream thus no direct interaction happens between the second projectile and wake vortices the wake vortices of the first and the second projectile evolves and develops independently because of a more considerable horizontal distance and the fact that they are stronger in strength the vortices from the first projectile under this transport speed was not immediately torn apart by the second projectile as in fig 11a instead they maintained quite stable as shown in fig 11a these large scale vortices tend to be more influential on the projectiles passing through them comparing with those scattered vortices under the transport velocity of u 0 07 for a medium transport velocity u 0 14 the pattern of tail vortex formation is similar that is to say with a smaller aoa projectiles tend to produce vortex rings from the bottom while with a larger aoa counter rotating cylindrical vortices fig 12 shows the tail vortices under u 0 14 those vortex rings in the wake of the first projectile are also pushed away with dls under u 0 14 like under u 0 07 the cylindrical vortices however only partially cover the second projectile with the gradual increase of aoa as the first projectile travels through water the strength of the counter rotating vortex pair also increases unlike passing through a wake dominated by vortex rings when second projectiles move past these strong cylindrical vortices they are surrounded within this phenomenon is similar to projectiles launched under u 0 21 in fig 9b affected by these vortices the pitch rate of the second projectile deflects suddenly at a vertical displacement of approximately 2 5 in fig 13 as demonstrated in fig 12b and c under a medium transport velocity the tail vortices of the first projectile will also be torn apart by the second it is worth noticing that another group of vortices appears downstream of the initial tail vortices in fig 12c when launched with a shorter time interval of δ t 1 00 3 4 influence of wake vortex encounter on pitch attitude fig 14 shows the variation of pitch attitude of first projectiles after clearing the launch tube the chart reveals that the variations of pitch attitude of first projectiles under the same transport velocity are identical regardless of the launch sequence for different transport velocities the pitch attitude tends to increase when u gets larger at a maximum transport velocity of u 0 21 the projectile has tilted for almost 30 after three units of vertical displacement under dls second projectiles encounter wake vortices directly as shown in fig 9b fig 15 shows pitch attitude variation of both projectiles under dls at various transport speeds except for u 0 07 the pitch attitude of second projectiles is all significantly smaller than that of the first at the same y the variation of pitch rate in fig 16 also tells the same the pitch rate of the second projectile under u 0 21 even gets close to zero at a vertical displacement of approximately 2 2 by associating from the previous flow analysis we can see the counter rotating vortex pairs from the first projectile lead to the lag of pitch attitude variation and the sharp decline of pitch rate of the second projectile under u 0 14 and u 0 21 in figs 14 and 16 are mainly caused by the counter rotating vortex pairs from the first projectile fig 17 is a surface pressure contour of the second projectiles under dls at y 1 9 this picture shows that the intensity of the low pressure region on the shoulder of the second projectile decreases with higher transport velocity when passing through the wake of the previous meanwhile fig 17 shows an apparent drift of the head stagnation point towards the lee side of the projectile at u 0 21 besides this drift a relatively high pressure region is also noticeable on the wind side of the tail section the pressure rise around the shoulder the head stagnation point drifting towards the lee side and the high pressure region appeared on the wind side of the tail section all lead to the declination of pitch momentum therefore reduces the pitch rate of second projectiles under dls as for the exceptional case of u 0 07 both first and second projectiles exhibits the same pattern of pitch attitude and pitch rate variation fig 9a shows that the second projectile under this transport velocity also passes through a series of vortices however these vortices are vortex rings instead of counter rotating cylindrical vortices hence we can conclude that the vortex rings do not affect the pitch attitude of projectiles as much as the cylindrical vortices upon vortex encounter even though no direct wve tends to happen under uls the pitch attitude of the second projectile is still affected by the wake from the previous figs 18 and 19 shows pitch attitude and pitch rate variation under uls for all three transport velocities the pitch attitude of the second projectiles is slightly smaller than that of the first one moreover the magnitude of this difference is related to the transport velocity the pitch attitude of first and second projectile differ most when the transport velocity is the lowest and differ least when highest as for pitch rate its difference between the first and the second projectiles under uls is considerably smaller than that under dls still the absolute values of the pitch rate of second projectiles are smaller than those of the first but the difference is minor below y 2 beyond y 2 5 pitch rate of the second projectile under u 0 14 and u 0 21 suddenly deviates as shown in fig 19 this deviation is caused by the gradual immersion of the second projectile into the wake due to pitch attitude decrease as shown in fig 11a 4 summary the structure of wake vortices of projectiles launched successively underwater including their influence on projectile hydro ballistic is studied numerically under different operational scenarios a verification and validation process is executed to evaluate the accuracy of the simulation numerical results of pitch attitude variation δ θ show good agreement with the experiment but its uncertainty is relatively high between 1 6 y 2 0 from the presented study we reach the following conclusions 1 two major types of vortices are discovered in the wake of projectiles launched with different transport velocities vortex rings with dominant vorticity in the horizontal direction and counter rotating vortex pairs in the vertical direction 2 the large scale vortices in the wake serve as the primary carrier for momentum transfer between the projectile and the flow field when travelling through water the rigid body momentum for projectiles keeps decreasing due to viscosity effects most of this momentum is transferred and stored in the vortices as angular momentum and eventually dissipate through viscous before breaking up the vortex structures in the wake are usually highly directional and the momentum within dominants in a specific direction 3 since the counter rotating vortex pairs can affect projectiles continuously along the longitudinal axis their influence on pitch attitude of second projectiles can be remarkable upon wve the vortex rings however are less influential 4 both the initial value and the increase of projectile aoa under high platform transport speed become more significant than those under lower speed the increased aoa not only leads to the early formation of counter rotating vortex pairs in the wake but also gives rise to their strength consequently more influential on projectiles upon wve affected by the strong counter rotating vortex pairs the pitch attitude of the projectiles launched under dls at a high transport speed like u 0 21 differ dramatically from each other 5 considering the successfulness of underwater salvo when launched with high transport velocity and the existence of strong cylindrical vortices the second projectiles should always avoid passing through the wake of the previous

22502,to understand the potential hazard and mechanism of wake vortex encounter underwater we perform a numerical simulation on two successively launched projectiles with 6 degrees of freedom the evolution of wake vortices and their interaction with projectiles are studied under various launcher transport speed and launch sequences two major wake vortex structures are discovered the vortex ring and the counter rotating vortex pair as the projectile angle of attack increases the dominant vortex inside the wake transforms from vortex rings to hairpin vortices then counter rotating vortex pairs the large scale vortices in the wake are highly directional before breaking up and the counter rotating vortex pairs can impose significant influence on projectile attitude upon wake vortex encounter in contrast minor influence can be done by vortex rings under the same situation projectiles launched with higher platform transport speed tend to be more affected by wake vortices due to

firstly studied by lanchester 1915 wake vortex has caused many disasters in history and severely limited the capacity of airports this kind of vortex also trails behind vehicles submerged in water saeidinezhad and dehghan 2015 its influence on follow up underwater vehicles however is still mostly unexplored nowadays with increasing demand on vertical launching capacity of submarines a systematic study on the effect and mechanism of wake vortex encounter underwater can be useful for submarine vertical launch systems vls substantial research has been conducted on the launching of a single projectile since most of these projectiles are ejected by high pressure gas at shallow water cavitation is usually inevitable this phenomenon attracted the attention of many researchers in the past decade wang and huang 2018 reviews recent studies on the hydrodynamics of high speed vehicles launched underwater and regards unsteady cavitation as significant in the launching process he argues that both the content of and the research method for high speed underwater launching problems are beyond the scope of classical hydrodynamics new methods explicitly targeting the evolution stability and collapse of the cavity for high speed vehicles shall be established to understand the process thoroughly wei et al 2009 studies the vertical launching of a single projectile numerically utilizing dynamic mesh method with one degree of freedom both gravity and cavitation are concerned in this study relationship between the cavitation number and the drag coefficient of the projectile is discussed wang also conducts several depressurized experiments for cavitation number similarity and a new internal collapse phenomenon is discovered wang et al 2016 2012 xue et al 2016 studies the ventilated gas bubble attached to an underwater vehicle under gravity field using potential theory and boundary element method bem it shows gravity has considerable influence on bubble shape and ventilation jet direction under certain combinations of froude and cavitation numbers sun et al 2019b a studies the ventilated partial cavitating flow around an underwater vehicle at the development stage by increasing the ventilation rate the partial cavity is found to be dynamically more stable wang et al 2014 studies cavitation during the water exit phase through numerical and experimental methods the study focuses on the collapse of cavity bubbles and its coupling effect with the dynamic response of the structure bending fracture is found to be the major potential damage form caused by cavity collapse apart from the shoulder cavity dyment et al 1998 thoroughly studies tail cavities at the base of underwater projectiles asymptotic analysis is used to yield similarity parameters both experimental and numerical methods are used to examine the stretching of cavities the study also discusses the problem from the aspects of thermodynamics ma et al 2018a b c 2019 conducts a thorough study on projectiles launched with moving platforms the characteristics of the gaseous pressure equalizing film and its effect on the projectile trajectory and attitude stability are numerically studied in his research the hydro ballistic uncertainty of these projectiles caused by platform transport speed and yaw position are also studied using chaos theory jo et al 2018 establishes a surface pressure prediction method for underwater projectiles based on genetic algorithm and a dataset generated by cfd they calculated the movement of projectiles with 6 degrees of freedom utilizing unstructured overset mesh and the spalart allmaras one equation turbulence model the study shows that the projectile escaping velocity and the platform transport velocity significantly affects the surface pressure characteristics of projectiles by causing vortices in the flow field weiland et al 2010 discusses a novel method of launching by water piercing via high speed gaseous jets the formation and characteristics of the gaseous jet path are studied but without considering the behaviour of projectiles however until now there are few published papers on the successive launch of multiple projectiles li 2018 conducts an experimental study on the launching of two projectiles with various platform transport speed and time interval his research focuses mainly on the phenomenons observed in experiments but lacks discussion on the mechanism the discoveries in his work however shows the necessity of an in depth study on this topic while cavitation plays a vital role in underwater launching and projectile water exit behaviour the successive launch of such projectiles can be dominated by other factors as well as in aviation the wake turbulence trailing behind submerged projectiles can play an essential role in limiting the launching capacity of submarines plenty of research focused on these wake flows in the past decades bridges and hornung 1994 experimentally studies the influence of an elliptic cross section tip on the vortex wake of antisymmetric bodies at incidence in a water tunnel the tip is found to be effective in varying the vortex wake geometry of a right circular cone at a large angle of attack saeidineshad conducts an experimental research on the hydrodynamic and wake vortex characteristics of a submerged vehicle saeidinezhad et al 2015 saeidinezhad and dehghan 2015 different nose shapes both axial symmetric and asymmetric are compared planar laser induced fluorescence plif is implemented to reveal the vortex structure the study shows that the location of flow separation for the non axisymmetric nose shape is closer to the tip than the symmetric ones at a high angle of attack a pair of stream wise vortices that are asymmetric in strength is observed in the turbulent wake of an axisymmetric darpa suboff submarine model in yaw in wind tunnel experiments by ashok et al 2015b with stereoscopic piv the weaker vortex quickly diffuses in these experiments but the stronger vortex maintains its strength quite far downstream for lack of further diffusion asymmetry is found in the wake of the submarine model even without a yaw angle ashok et al 2015a a pair of counter rotating vortices is observed and the clockwise vortex is found to be approximately 10 to 20 stronger than the counter clockwise vortex for wake vortices generated without incidence a large eddy simulation is executed by kumar and mahesh 2018 at a reynolds number of r e 1 1 1 0 6 the study stated that the thin hull boundary layer and long wake development length are the two decisive challenges of wake turbulence simulation for streamlined bodies for higher reynolds numbers from 1 1 1 0 6 to 67 1 0 6 a wind tunnel study is conducted by jiménez et al 2010 on the intermediate wake of a large scale axial symmetric vehicle the free surface effects on the turbulent wake of a surface piercing body are studied with a towed underwater piv by seol et al 2013 strong interaction between the wake and the free surface wave is observed at f r 0 4 jimenez et al 2010 studied the effects of fins on the turbulent wake behind a submarine model for r e from 0 49 1 0 6 to 1 8 1 0 6 they conclude that the fins create defects in velocity in the outer region of the wake and generate higher values of turbulence at fin tips nevertheless the vertical launching capacity of a submarine is not only limited by the presence of wake turbulence but also the operational scenario different launch patterns for example can be applied to avoid direct wake vortex encounter wve in order to evaluate the potential hazard of wve underwater direct and quantitative studies shall be conducted since few published papers focus on this aspect of the underwater vertical launch advanced research is essential in understanding the underlying phenomena and their mechanisms being relatively low cost and detailed in results numerical simulation utilizing the rans turbulent models is the best option for such study the presented study on the wake flow of slender axial symmetric projectiles launched successively underwater with different launch sequences and launcher transport velocities indicates that the outcome of second projectiles passing through the wake of the previous is potentially favourable to projectile attitude stability but also highly unpredictable when encountering with strong counter rotating cylindrical vortices we present the numerical set up and operational scenarios in section 2 along with dimensionless number definition and numerical result verification validation section 3 discusses the interaction between projectiles and tail vortices under different operational scenarios finally the conclusions are presented in section 4 2 simulation details 2 1 cfd geometry and operational scenario fig 1 shows the geometry and the boundary conditions of the simulation two projectiles are launched successively underwater at a depth of 10 m muzzle hatches are not included in the simulation but gas seals are preserved to prevent leakage during launch the transport velocity of the launch platform u is in the x negative direction the relative flow velocity caused by platform transport velocity therefore in the opposite two launch sequences are studied upwind launch sequence uls and downwind launch sequence dls in fig 1 projectile b is launched first then projectile a as the second with a time interval of δ t this procedure in which the projectile downstream is launched first is defined as the uls the dls is defined as the opposite since the gap between most of the 7 barrel vls tubes is 0 3 times tube diameter the spatial interval between the launch tubes axis h is set to be 1 3 d and the centre of these tubes be within the longitudinal symmetry plane the motion of the projectiles is simulated with 6dofs upon separating from the launch tube only 1dof along the y axis is simulated while inside projectiles are ejected with high pressure gas therefore the bottom of the launch tubes has a stagnation pressure inlet boundary condition in order to simulate the gas recycle process during practical launch the magnitude of pressure inlet inside the tube varies with time and drops to deck level right on projectile separation since most of the projectiles launched by modern submarines have a slenderness ratio around 5 to 12 m51 trident ii tomahawk 3m 54 a median value of 8 is used in the presented study for generality with 0 1 m in diameter the length of the projectiles is set to be 0 8 m the projectiles have ellipsoid heads with a compression factor of 3 we assume mass distributes uniformly inside these projectiles with a density of 2000 kg m 3 the distance from the centre of mass to the tip of the projectile l c is 0 5 l and the principal moment of inertia about this mass centre is 0 567 0 014 0 567 kg m 2 in order to maximize the potential hazard of wve underwater the launch time interval between projectiles under dls are set to be δ t l v e h u with v e 7 0 m s and u 1 0 m s the corresponding dimensionless time interval δ t mentioned later is then 2 15 under this time interval the head of the second projectile is expected to be right in the wake of the first projectile upon clearing the launch tube for uls two time intervals are studied with δ t 2 l v e and δ t l v e and the corresponding dimensionless time intervals to be δ t 2 0 and 1 0 since the second projectile under uls is unlikely to experience wve a shorter time interval is applied for comparison 2 2 dimensionless numbers in order to extend the utility of this study all quantities mentioned in this paper are dimensionless unless explicitly specified the problem studied is an initial boundary value problem and can be put into the form 1 f t δ t u p p g ρ w ρ g μ w g l d l c h x y v θ ψ ω z 0 the fundamental physical quantities are projectile length l projectile tube exit speed v e and water

variables studied in this paper e u σ t ρ g ρ w account for the compressibility of high pressure gas inside the launch tube and the development of cavity bubble at tube muzzle σ t also controls the projectile tube exit speed v e the location of the mass centre profoundly affect the behaviour of projectiles and is represented by l c l with a value of 0 5 meaning the projectiles are statically unstable while travelling underwater nature cavitation is ignored in this study because the projectiles are assumed to be launched at a depth with p 200 kpa in absolute pressure with a cavitation number larger than 20 the values for controlled variables in formula 3 are listed in table 1 2 3 numerical method the presented study is performed with commercial cfd code star ccm cd adapco 2017 the major physical phenomena modelled include multiphase flow compressibility turbulence wall boundary separation and gravity for muzzle bubble simulation and interface capturing a euler euler approach is implemented with the volume of fluid vof method the energy equation is included to predict the behaviour of these bubbles correctly and the ideal gas model is assigned to the gas phase no compressibility of water is included the projectiles have a reynolds number of around 5 1 0 6 upon separation therefore in the regime of turbulent flow the realizable k ϵ model is used for turbulence simulation and the transition of turbulent flow around the projectile is ignored a gravity of 9 8 m s 2 is also applied in the y negative direction as the only code to officially support wall boundary separation with overset mesh methodology star ccm offers a zero gap interface type for treatment of wall boundary interception and overlap the global approach is selected for zero gap interface during the hole cutting process alongside the close proximity option the linear interpolation method is chosen for data communication between the overset and background region a demonstration of the overset mesh and the unstructured polyhedron cell type used in this study is shown in fig 2a the basic cell size around the projectiles in both background and overset mesh regions is 0 08 d the sufficiency of this size is quantified later in the simulation verification section a total number of 10 evenly stretched prism layers lie on the surface of projectiles the maxim y of the prism layer is around 100 which is sufficient for the turbulence model used a contour of y on one of the projectiles is shown in fig 2b the simulations were executed on several workstations each mounted with two e 2640 processors 2 4 simulation verification and validation in order to evaluate the degree of accuracy of the numerical simulation a verification and validation effort is made following the instruction of asme v v 20 2009 v v however we have to drop certain requirements in this standard for they are beyond the reach of the presented study the solution validation and mesh independence analysis are performed on three different grid resolutions with a constant refinement factor of 1 3 the grid convergence indicator gci is calculated to estimate the discretization error quantitatively both numerical and experiment uncertainties are concerned in the validation process but not input uncertainty for its expensive cost the criteria proposed by coleman and stern 1997 on the comparison between validation comparison error e and validation uncertainty u v a l is adopted for validation the v v procedure is performed on the launching of a single projectile with u 0 5 f r 7 1 as one of the most concerned parameters during underwater launching pitch attitude θ within vertical displacement 1 y 2 3 is chosen as the validation variable the pitch attitude in this study is defined as the angle between the longitudinal body axis of a projectile and the horizontal plane zx plane as the indicator of correctness numerical uncertainty of the pitch attitude variation δ θ was evaluated through a set of three meshes with n 1 3 31 m n 2 1 42 m n 3 0 69 m by following the five step procedure in v v the grid refinement factor r 21 1 33 and r 21 1 27 were assumed to be constant with a value of r 1 3 this way the apparent order of accuracy p can be derived from 4 p ln δ θ 3 δ θ 2 δ θ 2 δ θ 1 ln r since the presented simulation is time dependent this calculation shall be carried out for each time step between 1 y 2 3 unfortunately due to the high non linearity and the chaotic nature of underwater launching process ma et al 2019 the calculated value of δ θ does not lie in the asymptotic region for y 1 5 that is to say do not converge with increased grid resolution in this interval therefore p was assumed to be 1 0 for uncertainty estimation between 1 0 y 1 5 as suggested v v the extrapolated value of pitch variation was then calculated by 5 δ θ e x t r a p o l a t e r p δ θ 1 δ θ 2 r p 1 for calculation of the numerical uncertainty a conservative factor of safety f s 3 0 was used finally the uncertainty was estimated to be 6 u n u m f s δ θ e x t r a p o l a t e δ θ 1 2 all three sets of δ θ along with the extrapolated δ θ e x t r a p o l a t e are show in fig 3 with u n u m as the uncertainty band for δ θ 1 the experiment for validation was carried out in an open water tank with a high speed camera the projectile used is geometric similar to that used in simulation but of 0 04 m in diameter f r u and σ t are all identical for both simulation and experiment but r e and e u differs a tripwire was placed on the head of the projectile to ensure a turbulent boundary layer a schematic of the experimental set up and the comparison between numerical and experimental results are shown in fig 4 the transport speed of the launch platform was simulated by a drive motor along the x negative direction a photron sa x high speed camera triggered with a laser switch lying across the tank was used to record the motion of the projectile the camera was tuned and calibrated on the xy plane therefore motion in the z direction was ignored a solenoid valve controlled the high pressure ejection gas in the launch tube and the storing gas tank was carried along the launch platform to improve the constancy of ejection pressure all devices are electronically controlled and synchronized with a digital controller to ensure repeatability of the launching process the position and pitch attitude of the projectile in the xy plane was extracted from the images with the assistance of matlab image processing toolbox a total number of five launches were recorded the experimental uncertainty u d of these measurements contains systematic uncertainty b θ and random uncertainty s θ 7 u d b θ 2 s θ 2 the systematic uncertainty of projectile pith measurement b θ includes errors caused by camera calibration against a ruler 0 4 mm and digital image discretization 2 px 1 9 mm px both divided by projectile length 320 mm thus 8 b θ 0 4 mm 2 2 px 1 9 mm px 2 320 mm 0 012 rad the random uncertainty is taken as the standard deviation of pitch attitude measured in all five launches 9 s θ 1 5 i 1 5 δ θ i δ θ the average of the experimental results δ θ e x p e r i m e n t is shown in fig 3 along with the experimental uncertainty u d calculated from formula 7 as uncertainty band in the absence of input uncertainty the validation uncertainty u v a l of δ θ 1 becomes 10 u v a l u n u m 2 u d 2 by computing the validation comparison error e δ θ 1 δ θ e x p e r i m e n t the modelling error of the simulation δ m o d e l shall fall between e u v a l e u v a l with e as its estimation fig 5 shows this estimation of modelling error in pitch attitude with u v a l as the uncertainty band in this figure δ m o d e l is relatively small with values no larger than 0 5 the uncertainty of this estimation however increases sharply between 1 6 y 2 1 form fig 3 we can conclude that this sharp increase mainly comes from u n u m who also experienced a sharp increase at the same interval after y 2 1 the uncertainty of modelling quickly drops to around 0 5 with δ m o d e l slowly increases to the same level table 2 shows the exact value of some validation parameters on the final stage of simulation at y 2 3 with a grid convergence index gci of 8 7 and e of 0 3 2 the final result is proved to be quite valid this contradictory phenomenon indicates the simulation is rather noisy between 1 6 y 2 1 but acquires an adequate level of confidence in final when y 2 2 as another important parameter mentioned by jo et al 2018 the projectile tube exit speed v e under different meshes is also presented in fig 6 we can see from this figure that v e converges asymptotically with higher grid resolution 3 results and discussion 3 1 shedding of tail vortices from first projectiles due to the transport velocity of the launching platform the projectiles exit the launch tube with a certain aoa two types of vortex structures are discovered in the wake due to this aoa a counter rotating vortex pair formed by flow separation at the trailing edge of a projectile with vorticity dominant in the vertical direction and vortex rings shedding from the bottom of the projectile with vorticity dominant in the horizontal direction fig 7a shows these two types of vortices with q criteria iso surfaces at q 1 the shedding of vortex rings is strongly periodic while the formation of the counter rotating vortex pair is relatively continuous this counter rotating vortex pair is also documented by saeidinezhad et al 2015 behind a submarine model at incidence distinguish differences can be found among the wake vortex structure of projectiles launched with different platform transport speed as a comparison between fig 7a and fig 7b reveals different platform transport speed can also be regarded as variations in initial aoa when the transport speed is relatively slow as u 0 07 the wake is mainly filled with vortex rings when the transport speed becomes relatively high as u 0 21 the vortex rings and the counter rotating vortex pairs merge into hairpin vortices the counter rotating vortex pair becomes the leg of the hairpin vortex and the vortex ring rolls up to form the vortex head under low transport speeds the strength of the bottom vortex whose vorticity is mostly along the horizontal direction is higher therefore they can generate closed vortex rings in the wake with the high swirling of these rings the nearby counter rotating cylindrical vortices are broken and entrained into the vortex rings the merging of the cylindrical vortices causes the variation of vorticity in the vortex ring and the ring plane to lean windward as illustrated in fig 8a the apparent change of direction of the ring plane normal can also be discovered from the development of bottom vortex rings in fig 7a when the transport speed is higher the counter rotating vortex pairs with vertical vorticity in dominant tends to be stronger fig 8b is a contour plot of the vorticity magnitude on the vertical and horizontal slice plane of first projectiles under different transport speeds in this figure the strength of the vortex ring shedding from the bottom fades as the transport velocity u increases from 0 07 to 0 21 however the strength of the vortex pair amplifies with a higher u under a transport speed of 0 21 the counter rotating vortex pair is strong enough to break the bottom vortex rings on the leeward side the broken rings merge with the cylindrical vortices on each side of the longitudinal symmetry plane and become the head of the newly formed hairpin vortex these hairpin vortices also inherit the periodicity of vortex rings moreover each of these hairpin vortices is connected successively through legs build up by the counter rotating vortex pairs to form a vortex packet as shown in fig 7b 3 2 hydrodynamic interaction between projectiles under downwind launch sequence all second projectiles experience wake vortex encounter under dls in fig 9a the wake of the first projectile affects the second through several vortex rings on the windward side of second projectiles due to the merging of counter rotating vortex pairs all the vortex rings lean windward toward the flow the high pressure at the tip of the second projectile pushes all the slanting vortex rings upstream as it passes by at the wake of the second projectile the tail vortices of the first and the second projectile strongly interact with each other and break into a great quantity of irregular and much smaller vortices when launched in a downwind sequence the flow field for u 0 07 and u 0 21 are significantly different from each other after the second projectiles has passed through a comparison of these two flow fields are made between fig 9a and fig 9b with a transport speed of u 0 21 the attitude and stability of the second projectile are mostly affected by the continuously distributed counter rotating vortex pair at its leeward side along the axial direction due to a shorter launch interval the second projectile under this transport speed reaches the tail vortices of the first one before they are fully developed these vortices do not break up after the second projectile had passed through but gradually evolved into closed vortex rings apparent differences can be found in the vorticity magnitude and q criteria contour lines between fig 10a and fig 10b when u 0 21 vortex cores characterized by the black q criteria contour lines on the longitudinal symmetry plane in fig 10b are much larger more regular and with higher vorticity strength as for u 0 07 in fig 10a the number of the vortex cores is more significant but their size is smaller than under u 0 21 the vortex flux through these closure lines representing the vortex core strength is also lower when compared with u 0 21 likewise the direction of the dominant momentum in the wake differs under different transport velocities fig 10a and fig 10b shows the tangential velocity vectors calculated within the earth coordinate system at low transport velocities the fluid in the wake of the second projectile moves mainly upward following the motion of the projectile while under a higher transport velocity the aoa of projectiles and the strength of counter rotating vortex pairs at the leeward side of them become higher therefore passing on more horizontal momentum into the fluid and forcing it to move horizontally 3 3 hydrodynamic interaction between projectiles under upwind launch sequence comparing with those under a dls the vortices created by the first projectile under a uls at low transport velocity breaks up earlier fig 11b shows that the tail vortices of the first projectile under uls are also made up mostly with vortex rings due to lower transport velocities however these vortex rings stretch upstream as they evolve and expand when the second projectile passes by from upstream these stretched rings make contact and interact with it by the pitch attitude data below we can conclude that this interaction of vortex rings with the second projectiles do not put much influence on them however the adverse pressure gradient in fig 11c on the lee side of the projectile produces a powerful suction effect to tear the vortices apart affected by this adverse pressure gradient the vortex rings in the wake of the first projectile launched in an upwind sequence under low transport velocities break up earlier than those in a downwind sequence for high transport velocities such as u 0 21 in fig 11 the intensity of counter rotating vortex pairs becomes remarkably stronger as for the vortices shedding from the bottom of the projectile they gradually disappear while the projectile aoa increases during underwater flight finally the hairpin vortices in the wake are replaced by counter rotating vortex pairs for the lack of bottom vortex rings to make up the head the absolute value of the attack angle of a projectile is the smallest when it has just clear the launch muzzle at this initial stage of flight the shedding of vortices is similar to those under low transport velocity likewise the hairpin vortex generated by this shedding has strong vortex heads these heads of the hairpin vortices will finally evolve into separate vortex rings however the vortices shedding from the bottom of projectiles get weaker as the aoa increases continuously during flight therefore the formation of the hairpin vortex head by these vortices stops gradually ultimately the vortices in the wake of these projectiles turned from hairpin vortices into counter rotating cylindrical vortex pair with u 0 21 the speed of the vortices moving downstream is faster than stretching upstream thus no direct interaction happens between the second projectile and wake vortices the wake vortices of the first and the second projectile evolves and develops independently because of a more considerable horizontal distance and the fact that they are stronger in strength the vortices from the first projectile under this transport speed was not immediately torn apart by the second projectile as in fig 11a instead they maintained quite stable as shown in fig 11a these large scale vortices tend to be more influential on the projectiles passing through them comparing with those scattered vortices under the transport velocity of u 0 07 for a medium transport velocity u 0 14 the pattern of tail vortex formation is similar that is to say with a smaller aoa projectiles tend to produce vortex rings from the bottom while with a larger aoa counter rotating cylindrical vortices fig 12 shows the tail vortices under u 0 14 those vortex rings in the wake of the first projectile are also pushed away with dls under u 0 14 like under u 0 07 the cylindrical vortices however only partially cover the second projectile with the gradual increase of aoa as the first projectile travels through water the strength of the counter rotating vortex pair also increases unlike passing through a wake dominated by vortex rings when second projectiles move past these strong cylindrical vortices they are surrounded within this phenomenon is similar to projectiles launched under u 0 21 in fig 9b affected by these vortices the pitch rate of the second projectile deflects suddenly at a vertical displacement of approximately 2 5 in fig 13 as demonstrated in fig 12b and c under a medium transport velocity the tail vortices of the first projectile will also be torn apart by the second it is worth noticing that another group of vortices appears downstream of the initial tail vortices in fig 12c when launched with a shorter time interval of δ t 1 00 3 4 influence of wake vortex encounter on pitch attitude fig 14 shows the variation of pitch attitude of first projectiles after clearing the launch tube the chart reveals that the variations of pitch attitude of first projectiles under the same transport velocity are identical regardless of the launch sequence for different transport velocities the pitch attitude tends to increase when u gets larger at a maximum transport velocity of u 0 21 the projectile has tilted for almost 30 after three units of vertical displacement under dls second projectiles encounter wake vortices directly as shown in fig 9b fig 15 shows pitch attitude variation of both projectiles under dls at various transport speeds except for u 0 07 the pitch attitude of second projectiles is all significantly smaller than that of the first at the same y the variation of pitch rate in fig 16 also tells the same the pitch rate of the second projectile under u 0 21 even gets close to zero at a vertical displacement of approximately 2 2 by associating from the previous flow analysis we can see the counter rotating vortex pairs from the first projectile lead to the lag of pitch attitude variation and the sharp decline of pitch rate of the second projectile under u 0 14 and u 0 21 in figs 14 and 16 are mainly caused by the counter rotating vortex pairs from the first projectile fig 17 is a surface pressure contour of the second projectiles under dls at y 1 9 this picture shows that the intensity of the low pressure region on the shoulder of the second projectile decreases with higher transport velocity when passing through the wake of the previous meanwhile fig 17 shows an apparent drift of the head stagnation point towards the lee side of the projectile at u 0 21 besides this drift a relatively high pressure region is also noticeable on the wind side of the tail section the pressure rise around the shoulder the head stagnation point drifting towards the lee side and the high pressure region appeared on the wind side of the tail section all lead to the declination of pitch momentum therefore reduces the pitch rate of second projectiles under dls as for the exceptional case of u 0 07 both first and second projectiles exhibits the same pattern of pitch attitude and pitch rate variation fig 9a shows that the second projectile under this transport velocity also passes through a series of vortices however these vortices are vortex rings instead of counter rotating cylindrical vortices hence we can conclude that the vortex rings do not affect the pitch attitude of projectiles as much as the cylindrical vortices upon vortex encounter even though no direct wve tends to happen under uls the pitch attitude of the second projectile is still affected by the wake from the previous figs 18 and 19 shows pitch attitude and pitch rate variation under uls for all three transport velocities the pitch attitude of the second projectiles is slightly smaller than that of the first one moreover the magnitude of this difference is related to the transport velocity the pitch attitude of first and second projectile differ most when the transport velocity is the lowest and differ least when highest as for pitch rate its difference between the first and the second projectiles under uls is considerably smaller than that under dls still the absolute values of the pitch rate of second projectiles are smaller than those of the first but the difference is minor below y 2 beyond y 2 5 pitch rate of the second projectile under u 0 14 and u 0 21 suddenly deviates as shown in fig 19 this deviation is caused by the gradual immersion of the second projectile into the wake due to pitch attitude decrease as shown in fig 11a 4 summary the structure of wake vortices of projectiles launched successively underwater including their influence on projectile hydro ballistic is studied numerically under different operational scenarios a verification and validation process is executed to evaluate the accuracy of the simulation numerical results of pitch attitude variation δ θ show good agreement with the experiment but its uncertainty is relatively high between 1 6 y 2 0 from the presented study we reach the following conclusions 1 two major types of vortices are discovered in the wake of projectiles launched with different transport velocities vortex rings with dominant vorticity in the horizontal direction and counter rotating vortex pairs in the vertical direction 2 the large scale vortices in the wake serve as the primary carrier for momentum transfer between the projectile and the flow field when travelling through water the rigid body momentum for projectiles keeps decreasing due to viscosity effects most of this momentum is transferred and stored in the vortices as angular momentum and eventually dissipate through viscous before breaking up the vortex structures in the wake are usually highly directional and the momentum within dominants in a specific direction 3 since the counter rotating vortex pairs can affect projectiles continuously along the longitudinal axis their influence on pitch attitude of second projectiles can be remarkable upon wve the vortex rings however are less influential 4 both the initial value and the increase of projectile aoa under high platform transport speed become more significant than those under lower speed the increased aoa not only leads to the early formation of counter rotating vortex pairs in the wake but also gives rise to their strength consequently more influential on projectiles upon wve affected by the strong counter rotating vortex pairs the pitch attitude of the projectiles launched under dls at a high transport speed like u 0 21 differ dramatically from each other 5 considering the successfulness of underwater salvo when launched with high transport velocity and the existence of strong cylindrical vortices the second projectiles should always avoid passing through the wake of the previous

methods have drawn great attention huang et al 2019 based on compensation liquid medium pressure compensators can be divided into those with water or with oil huang et al 2012 the water based compensator uses fresh water or seawater as compensation fluid and exchanges it with external seawater to achieve pressure balance majdič et al 2013 the oil based pressure compensator takes mineral oil as compensating medium to effectively eliminate direct contact between devices in a junction box and external seawater yuan et al 2012 aranovskiy et al 2015 this results in isolation of compensation oil from external seawater and creates a closed system in a junction box it helps to avoid the risk of component erosion as well for watertight junction boxes containing sophisticated electronic components an oil based pressure compensator is regarded most appropriate the commonly used oil based pressure compensators and their characteristics are outlined in table 1 compared with leather bag type corrugated pipe type and piston type the film type pressure compensator has the advantages of small volume sensitive response simple structure and long service life therefore the film type pressure compensator is the primary choice in our research the existing thin film adaptive pressure compensator still has space to improve due to the following aspects 1 oil compressibility has

limiting working depth and affecting performance of a compensator to cope with the above mentioned challenges a pre compression method is proposed in this study to improve the pressure compensation performance of a film type pressure self adaptive watertight junction box fpjb this method allows fpjb to work in deeper sea the rest of the paper is structured as follows after the brief introduction of work principle of fpjb in section 2 the mathematic relationship between water depth and pressure difference has been established with the consideration of oil compressibility and residual gas in section 3 based on the mathematic calculation simulation is used to analyze how the factors affect the compensation performance of fpjb such as depth pre compression pressure film thickness initial volume and residual gas content in section 4 the test of prototype fpjb in a high pressure chamber has verified its feasibility reliability and pressure keeping property the conclusion remarks are given in section 5 2 methodology the work principle of fpjb equipped in an underwater vehicle is illustrated in fig 1 before an underwater vehicle dives the initial state of fpjb is shown in fig 1 1 given pre compression pressure the film of compensation chamber deforms upward as displayed in fig 1 2 in fig 1 3 as the underwater vehicle dives deeper in working state the film gradually deforms downward along with the increase of external pressure here p 0 is the pressure in initial state v 0 is the initial volume of fpjb chamber without pre compression p c is the pre compression pressure v i n is the initial volume with pre compression p e and v e are the pressure and the volume in the working state respectively the internal and external pressure reaches balance through adjusting the internal volume of compensation chamber in this process two basic principles must be followed first to prevent film damage the film with downward deformation cannot touch the components sealed in fpjb this limits the film deformation range second the pressure difference must not exceed the threshold of seal ring and would lead to sealing failure otherwise therefore it could be perceived that the maximum displacement of film and the pressure difference are two critical factors note that the other parts of fpjb also have deformation but such deformation is nearly zero compared with the film deformation hence in the following analysis fpjb as a whole can be regarded rigid and has no deformation in this section the influence of oil compressibility and residual gas in hydraulic oil are first analyzed to obtain the maximum displacement of film two methods are required i e fourier expansion and minimum potential energy method then in section 2 2 the volume change of compensation chamber is calculated for the purpose of applying fourier expansion after that the maximum displacement of film could be calculated and the relationship between pressure difference and water depth could be established by combining fourier expansion and minimum potential energy method which are detailed in section 2 3 section 2 4 presents the critical parameters in fpjb design and calculates the pressure difference and the maximum film displacement 2 1 the influence of residual gas on hydraulic oil compressibility in deep sea environment volume of hydraulic oil could be compressed most current works have not considered this compression and some studies consider the change in volume but ignore bubbles dissolved in oil however there is significant difference between the compressibility of oil mixed with residual gas and that of pure oil shi et al 2007 in the rest of this section how residual gas influences hydraulic oil compressibility is elaborated in different environments oil density is most sensitive to pressure and temperature the density of pure hydraulic oil ρ l can be expressed as dowson and higginson 2014 1 ρ l ρ r e f 1 1 b l p p r e f α t t r e f where ρ r e f t r e f and p r e f are the reference density temperature and pressure respectively b l is the volume elastic modulus of pure hydraulic oil and α is the thermal expansion coefficient of pure hydraulic oil the density of gas containing hydraulic oil ρ g l t p can be expressed as shi et al 2007 2 ρ g l t p 1 ρ g s t p ρ l s t p c d 1 c d c u 1 c u 1 ρ l 1 ρ l s t p p s t p p s a t p s a t p 1 k t t s t p c d 1 c d c u 1 c u where ρ g s t p and ρ l s t p represent the density of gas and the density of pure hydraulic oil in the standard state respectively c d and c u represent the volume percentage of dissolved and undissolved gas in hydraulic oil respectively ρ l represents the density of pure hydraulic oil obtained from equation 1 p s t p is the standard pressure p s a t is the saturation pressure and t is the corresponding temperature when air reaches full dissolution in compensation chamber and k represents the coefficient of gas volume change the changes of the density of pure oil and that of gas containing hydraulic oil along with the change of temperature and pressure are simulated by matlab the corresponding results are displayed in figs 2 and 3 respectively here the parameters are set as following ρ r e f 900 0 kg m3 b l 1900 0 mpa t r e f 293 15 k p s t p 0 1 mpa p s a t 0 2 mpa α 0 0006 k 1 ρ g s t p 1 293 kg m3 k 1 4 c u 0 002 and c d 0 04 fig 3 clearly demonstrates that when environmental pressure increases from 0 1 to 0 2 mpa the density of gas containing hydraulic oil dramatically increases from 868 5 to 880 2 kg m3 under environmental temperature of 290 k this phenomenon is caused by the severe compression of gas bubbles in hydraulic oil and often called pressure shock oliver et al 2016 pressure shock may lead to the sudden breakdown of fpjb therefore to avoid the occurrence of this phenomenon and improve the reliability of compensation performance of fpjb a new approach i e pre compression method is proposed in this paper and its mechanism is explained here with the help of fig 1 in initial stage inject hydraulic oil into the chamber until internal and external pressure reaches balance continue the oil injection until the internal pressure exceeds the external by 0 1 mpa this leads to the upward deformation of film the reason to choose 0 1 mpa lies in that pre compensation pressure 0 1 mpa avoids the pressure shock range 0 1 0 2 mpa in working state in high pressure environment the film would suffer from less deformation 2 2 calculation of the volume change in this section in order to utilize the first term of fourier expansion formula to approximate the film deflection function the volume change of compensation chamber needs to be calculated first the total volume change can be represented as the sum of pure hydraulic oil volume change δ v l and gas volume change δ v g to simplify computation δ v l and δ v g can be calculated respectively to obtain the volume change δ v 3 δ v δ v l δ v g in working state the following formula can be obtained from equation 1 4 ρ l 1 ρ l 0 1 1 b l p 1 p 0 α t 1 t 0 where ρ l 1 p 1 and t 1 represent the density the pressure and the temperature of pure hydraulic oil respectively in working state ρ l 0 p 0 and t 0 represent the corresponding values in initial state b l is the volume elastic modulus of pure hydraulic oil and α is the coefficient of thermal expansion according to conservation of mass the following equation is established 5 ρ l 1 v l 1 ρ l 0 v l 0 substituting equation 4 into equation 5 leads to 6 ρ l 0 1 1 b l p 1 p 0 α t 1 t 0 v l 1 ρ l 0 v l 0 now it can be deduced 7 δ v l v l 0 v l 1 v l 0 1 b l p 1 p 0 α t 1 t 0 1 1 b l p 1 p 0 α t 1 t 0 v l 0 c 1 c here define c as the volume change rate of pure hydraulic oil which is c 1 b l p 1 p 0 α t 1 t 0 set the initial gas content as c g and it can be deduced 8 v g 0 c g v i n 9 v l 0 v i n v g 0 1 c g v i n δ v l could be calculated with combining equations 7 and 9 next the calculation of δ v g will be explained the first relationship is straightforward 10 δ v g v g 0 v g 1 where v g 0 and v g 1 represent the gas volume at the initial and the working state respectively assume that in a standard state environmental gas dissolves completely and reaches saturation in hydraulic oil then 11 v s a t v s t p p s t p p s a t t s a t t s t p where v s t p p s t p and t s t p are the volume pressure and temperature respectively in standard state p s a t represents the pressure of hydraulic oil when gas dissolves completely and reaches saturation and t s a t represents the corresponding temperature during the compression expansion process the gas volume change follows the exponential law as following 12 v g v s a t p s t p p 1 k where k represents the gas volume change index substituting equation 11 into equation 12 gets 13 v g v s t p p s t p p s a t t s a t t s t p p s a t p 1 k in the initial state both pressure and temperature

volume change can be obtained 16 δ v v l 0 c 1 c v g 0 v g 0 p 0 p s a t t sat t 0 p s a t p 1 1 k 2 3 the relationship between pressure difference and water depth in this section the relationship between the pressure difference on both sides of the film and the diving depth is established through calculating the maximum displacement of film with two methods i e fourier expansion and minimum potential energy method since nonlinear relationship exists between pressure difference and the maximum displacement of film the minimum potential energy method put forth by vlassk and nix vlassak and nix 1992 is applied to solve it here the maximum displacement of film d could be calculated by 17 d g v a b p d a 4 1 v e t 1 3 where g v a b is a nonlinear function related to poisson s ratio v and the ratio of chamber length to width a b in this study v is 0 35 a b is 1 94 and g v a b is approximately equal to 1 e is the elastic modulus of the film t is the thickness of the film and p d is the pressure difference on both sides of the film when the film deforms inward or outward due to volume change the largest displacement appears at the center of the film set d as the displacement of this center point the deflection function of the film is expanded into a fourier series v x is used to represent the volume difference between v 0 at initial state without pre compression and the volume after deformation keep only the first item the changed volume v x can be approximately expressed as 18 v x d cos π x 2 a cos π y 2 b d x d y 16 a b d π 2 it can be easily deduced from fig 1 that 19 δ v v x 0 v x 1 substituting equation 18 into equation 19 gets 20 δ v v x 0 16 a b d 1 π 2 where d 1 is the maximum displacement of the film according to equation 20 d 1 can be rewritten as 21 d 1 π 2 δ v v x 0 16 a b combining equations 17 and 21 the following relationship can be established 22 π 2 δ v v x 0 16 a b p d a 4 1 v e t 1 3 v x 0 is the changed volume after pre compression as displayed in fig 1 2 and can be obtained by combining equations 17 and 18 which is as follows 23 v x 0 16 a b π 2 p c a 4 1 v e t 1 3 where p c displayed in fig 1 2 as well is the pre compression pressure combining equations 16 and 22 the equilibrium equation of the system can be established 24 π 2 v l 0 c 1 c v g 0 v g 0 p 0 p s a t t s a t t 0 p s a t p 1 1 k v x 0 16 a b p d a 4 1 v e t 1 3 additionally according to the balance of internal and external pressure it can be formulated 25 p e p 1 p d where p e is the environmental pressure p 1 is the internal working pressure under environmental pressure and p d is the pressure difference on both sides of the film both equations 24 and 25 express the relationship between the environmental pressure of fpjb and the pressure difference on both sides of the film however these equations have no analytic solution because equation 24 is a transcendental equation hence the dichotomy method is employed here to solve these equations which is illustrated by the flow chart in fig 4 2 4 the design of fpjb in this section the parameters and the structures of fpjb are first presented then the maximum displacement and the pressure difference are calculated with two iterations and their corresponding results are displayed and analyzed the major parameters of designed fpjb are listed in table 2 fig 5 is the schematic diagram of fpjb the pressure plate mounted on the top of the box is designed to ensure seal performance and each of its mounting holes has o sealing rings the shield is installed on the pressure plate to protect the titanium film from external objects suppose sea surface temperature is 28 6 c and the pressure is 0 1013 mpa at the depth of 4000 m the temperature is 2 c the pressure is 40 mpa and the pre compression pressure is 0 1 mpa after two iterations of calculation table 3 displays the comparison results between without pre compression and with 0 1 mpa pre compression method apparently compared with the state without pre compression the 0 1 mpa pre compression compensation yields smaller maximum displacement and lower pressure difference after the second iteration the maximum displacement changes from 15 17 mm to 7 70 mm and the pressure difference from 0 76 mpa to 0 0996 mpa this proves that the pre compression improves reliability and compensation performance of the film 3 results and discussions the compensation performance of fpjb is determined by a number of factors as equation 24 indicates most of which are associated with environment and could hardly be adjusted properly designed parameters of fpbj would be of significant value for improving its compensation performance therefore in this section how the pre compression pressure the film thickness the initial volume of chamber and the residual gas content in hydraulic oil affect the pressure compensation performance is investigated via simulation 3 1 the pre compression pressure in this section first the relationship between depth and water temperature is fitted based on this how the maximum displacement and the pressure difference change along with the water depth under both conditions of with and without pre compression is analyzed additionally the method to calculate pre compression pressure is discussed it is known that underwater temperature is affected by many factors among which the geographic position water depth and time are predominant so far it remains challenging to map the accurate relationship between water depth and environmental temperature in this paper real time data collected from argo in china internal id number 0092 section number 226 were applied to demonstrate this relationship and an exponential function is selected to fit the data as displayed in fig 6 china argo real time data center 2018 the formula for fitting the curve is 26 t 27 72 e 0 0027 d 2 by combining equation 26 with equation 24 the relationship between the maximum displacement and the depth can be obtained and plotted under both conditions of with or without pre compression as illustrated in fig 7 1 in the same principle combining equation 26 with equation 25 the relationship between the pressure difference and the depth is displayed in fig 7 2 as shown in fig 7 1 when without pre compression the maximum displacement climbs up rapidly before 1000 m depth then slows down the pace and reaches 15 23 mm at 4000 m depth this is caused first by the compression of residual gas in hydraulic oil and second by the increased oil density due to temperature drop when with 0 1 mpa pre compression the maximum displacement decreases from the initial value 7 59 mm to 0 at the depth of 460 m and then goes up and reaches 7 71 mm at 4000 m on the whole the maximum displacement with pre compression is significantly lower than that without pre compression fig 7 2 describes how the pressure difference varies with depths without pre compression the pressure difference steadily increases and approaches 0 8 mpa however with 0 1 mpa pre compression pressure the pressure difference first drops to zero and then slowly climbs up and reaches 0 1 mpa at 4000 m apparently 0 1 mpa pre compression pressure helps to significantly decrease the pressure difference note that excessive pre compression would cause the damage of film the method to calculate the appropriate pre compression pressure is discussed as follows to minimize the maximum film displacement in diving processes fig 8 1 is used to depict the relationship between initial displacement and pre compression pressure and the relationship between the displacement in working state with 4000 m depth and pre compression pressure obviously the initial displacement and the working state displacement change with an opposite trend the intersection point with the displacement of 7 71 mm corresponds to 0 1 mpa pre compression pressure at this point the maximum displacement has the minimum value because the maximum displacement is the larger one of these two displacements moreover fig 8 2 further proves that when the pre compression pressure is 0 1 mpa its corresponding pressure difference is within 0 2 mpa and acceptable therefore 0 1 mpa was regarded as the appropriate pre compression pressure value 3 2 film thickness the maximum displacement and the pressure difference under different film thicknesses at 4000 m depth can be calculated according to equations 24 and 25 respectively the results of with and without pre compression pressure are displayed in fig 9 when without pre compression the maximum displacement slowly increases from 14 97 mm to 15 57 mm along with the increasing thickness with 0 1 mpa pre compression pressure the maximum displacement increases from initial 5 58 mm 10 77 mm overall compared with the state without pre compression the maximum displacement is significantly reduced with 0 1 mpa pre compression pressure furthermore in fig 9 2 in both cases the pressure difference has a nearly linear relationship with the film thickness the value changes from 0 365 mpa to 4 11 mpa without pre compression and from 0 0189 mpa to 1 36 mpa with 0 1 mpa pre compression pressure fig 9 proves the validity of pre compression and shows that the thinner film possess better compensation performance taking the film strength into consideration 1 mm film thickness is selected in the prototype 3 3 initial volume of fpjb the maximum displacement and the pressure difference at a 4000 m depth were calculated for different initial volumes according to equations 24 and 25 and are displayed respectively in fig 10 the maximum displacement increases linearly in with and without pre compression conditions as initial volume increases also the pressure difference increases in both conditions compared with the state without pre compression the pre compression state has lower value in the maximum displacement and the pressure difference thus provides a better compensation performance of fpjb apart from the initial volume the volume occupied by internal components and the inward protrusion volume of the film should also be considered the initial volume is set to 7 5 10 3 m3 in the prototype when taking all the factors into consideration 3 4 residual gas content in hydraulic oil the maximum displacement and the pressure difference at 4000 m depth were calculated for different residual gas content in hydraulic oil according to equations 24 and 25 and displayed in fig 11 respectively as displayed in fig 11 1 the maximum displacement increases linearly with and without pre compression and the pressure difference increases with the increasing of residual gas content apparently the residual gas content significantly affects compensation performance specifically the less the residual gas content in the hydraulic oil is the better the compensation performance could be provided by fpjb the residual gas in the hydraulic oil should be minimized and be accurately measured so that the compensation performance can be analyzed better in this paper the residual gas content is minimized and controlled within 1 in the oil injection process and in the simulation analysis it is set to be 1 4 high pressure chamber tests the fpjb prototype is displayed in fig 12 to verify its feasibility and reliability the prototype was tested in a high pressure chamber at the state key laboratory of fluid power and mechatronics in china as pictured in fig 13 the maximum work pressure of the chamber is 60 mpa a pressure impact test was to evaluate fpjb s feasibility and reliability and a pressure retaining test was to verify the pressure keeping property of fpjb the test steps were listed as follows 1 inject hydraulic oil into the fpjb chamber to minimize the residual gas content and preload pressure until it reaches 0 2 mpa 2 fix fpjb to the high pressure chamber bracket and inject water into the high pressure chamber place the bracket at the bottom and cover the chamber lid to ensure sealing of the high pressure chamber 3 switch on the valve and pump and inject water into the high pressure chamber to drain the remaining gas 4 switch off the valve and continuously inject water into the high pressure chamber until the pressure reaches 45 mpa 5 the pressure is maintained for a period after that switch on the valve to let internal pressure drop to environmental pressure in total 20 compression tests were carried out as mapped in fig 14 two of them were purposed to maintain 45 mpa pressure for more than 10 h the rest tests lasted less than 10 min each time the internal pressure of fpjb before and after the tests remained the same compared with the initial value 66331 g the weight of fpjb after tests increased by only 8 g which could be almost ignored therefore the high pressure chamber tests further verify fpjb pressure keeping property feasibility and reliability 5 conclusions in this paper a pre compression method is proposed to improve the pressure compensation performance of fpjb and the relationship between water depth and pressure difference is established with the consideration of oil compressibility and residual gas content several factors that affect the compensation performance of fpjb are analyzed via simulation the prototype fpjb in a high pressure chamber is also tested to verify its reliability and sealing performance both the simulation and the chamber test results indicate that 1 the pre compression method would significantly improve the reliability and compensation performance of fpjb 2 the best pre compression pressure is the pressure that makes the initial displacement and working state displacement equal thinner film thickness smaller initial volume and lower residual gas content would improve the compensation performance of fpjb these characteristics are considered to be an important reference for the similar instruments design however there is still space to improve for example the proposed pre compression method requires working depth to be constant this might not be suitable for underwater vehicles which frequently changes working depth additionally this study only conducted pressure experiments for performance evaluation in the laboratory in the future sea experiments would be conducted to test the performance of fpjb

04 fig 3 clearly demonstrates that when environmental pressure increases from 0 1 to 0 2 mpa the density of gas containing hydraulic oil dramatically increases from 868 5 to 880 2 kg m3 under environmental temperature of 290 k this phenomenon is caused by the severe compression of gas bubbles in hydraulic oil and often called pressure shock oliver et al 2016 pressure shock may lead to the sudden breakdown of fpjb therefore to avoid the occurrence of this phenomenon and improve the reliability of compensation performance of fpjb a new approach i e pre compression method is proposed in this paper and its mechanism is explained here with the help of fig 1 in initial stage inject hydraulic oil into the chamber until internal and external pressure reaches balance continue the oil injection until the internal pressure exceeds the external by 0 1 mpa this leads to the upward deformation of film the reason to choose 0 1 mpa lies in that pre compensation pressure 0 1 mpa avoids the pressure shock range 0 1 0 2 mpa in working state in high pressure environment the film would suffer from less deformation 2 2 calculation of the volume change in this section in order to utilize the first term of fourier expansion formula to approximate the film deflection function the volume change of compensation chamber needs to be calculated first the total volume change can be represented as the sum of pure hydraulic oil volume change δ v l and gas volume change δ v g to simplify computation δ v l and δ v g can be calculated respectively to obtain the volume change δ v 3 δ v δ v l δ v g in working state the following formula can be obtained from equation 1 4 ρ l 1 ρ l 0 1 1 b l p 1 p 0 α t 1 t 0 where ρ l 1 p 1 and t 1 represent the density the pressure and the temperature of pure hydraulic oil respectively in working state ρ l 0 p 0 and t 0 represent the corresponding values in initial state b l is the volume elastic modulus of pure hydraulic oil and α is the coefficient of thermal expansion according to conservation of mass the following equation is established 5 ρ l 1 v l 1 ρ l 0 v l 0 substituting equation 4 into equation 5 leads to 6 ρ l 0 1 1 b l p 1 p 0 α t 1 t 0 v l 1 ρ l 0 v l 0 now it can be deduced 7 δ v l v l 0 v l 1 v l 0 1 b l p 1 p 0 α t 1 t 0 1 1 b l p 1 p 0 α t 1 t 0 v l 0 c 1 c here define c as the volume change rate of pure hydraulic oil which is c 1 b l p 1 p 0 α t 1 t 0 set the initial gas content as c g and it can be deduced 8 v g 0 c g v i n 9 v l 0 v i n v g 0 1 c g v i n δ v l could be calculated with combining equations 7 and 9 next the calculation of δ v g will be explained the first relationship is straightforward 10 δ v g v g 0 v g 1 where v g 0 and v g 1 represent the gas volume at the initial and the working state respectively assume that in a standard state environmental gas dissolves completely and reaches saturation in hydraulic oil then 11 v s a t v s t p p s t p p s a t t s a t t s t p where v s t p p s t p and t s t p are the volume pressure and temperature respectively in standard state p s a t represents the pressure of hydraulic oil when gas dissolves completely and reaches saturation and t s a t represents the corresponding temperature during the compression expansion process the gas volume change follows the exponential law as following 12 v g v s a t p s t p p 1 k where k represents the gas volume change index substituting equation 11 into equation 12 gets 13 v g v s t p p s t p p s a t t s a t t s t p p s a t p 1 k in the initial state both pressure and temperature

volume change can be obtained 16 δ v v l 0 c 1 c v g 0 v g 0 p 0 p s a t t sat t 0 p s a t p 1 1 k 2 3 the relationship between pressure difference and water depth in this section the relationship between the pressure difference on both sides of the film and the diving depth is established through calculating the maximum displacement of film with two methods i e fourier expansion and minimum potential energy method since nonlinear relationship exists between pressure difference and the maximum displacement of film the minimum potential energy method put forth by vlassk and nix vlassak and nix 1992 is applied to solve it here the maximum displacement of film d could be calculated by 17 d g v a b p d a 4 1 v e t 1 3 where g v a b is a nonlinear function related to poisson s ratio v and the ratio of chamber length to width a b in this study v is 0 35 a b is 1 94 and g v a b is approximately equal to 1 e is the elastic modulus of the film t is the thickness of the film and p d is the pressure difference on both sides of the film when the film deforms inward or outward due to volume change the largest displacement appears at the center of the film set d as the displacement of this center point the deflection function of the film is expanded into a fourier series v x is used to represent the volume difference between v 0 at initial state without pre compression and the volume after deformation keep only the first item the changed volume v x can be approximately expressed as 18 v x d cos π x 2 a cos π y 2 b d x d y 16 a b d π 2 it can be easily deduced from fig 1 that 19 δ v v x 0 v x 1 substituting equation 18 into equation 19 gets 20 δ v v x 0 16 a b d 1 π 2 where d 1 is the maximum displacement of the film according to equation 20 d 1 can be rewritten as 21 d 1 π 2 δ v v x 0 16 a b combining equations 17 and 21 the following relationship can be established 22 π 2 δ v v x 0 16 a b p d a 4 1 v e t 1 3 v x 0 is the changed volume after pre compression as displayed in fig 1 2 and can be obtained by combining equations 17 and 18 which is as follows 23 v x 0 16 a b π 2 p c a 4 1 v e t 1 3 where p c displayed in fig 1 2 as well is the pre compression pressure combining equations 16 and 22 the equilibrium equation of the system can be established 24 π 2 v l 0 c 1 c v g 0 v g 0 p 0 p s a t t s a t t 0 p s a t p 1 1 k v x 0 16 a b p d a 4 1 v e t 1 3 additionally according to the balance of internal and external pressure it can be formulated 25 p e p 1 p d where p e is the environmental pressure p 1 is the internal working pressure under environmental pressure and p d is the pressure difference on both sides of the film both equations 24 and 25 express the relationship between the environmental pressure of fpjb and the pressure difference on both sides of the film however these equations have no analytic solution because equation 24 is a transcendental equation hence the dichotomy method is employed here to solve these equations which is illustrated by the flow chart in fig 4 2 4 the design of fpjb in this section the parameters and the structures of fpjb are first presented then the maximum displacement and the pressure difference are calculated with two iterations and their corresponding results are displayed and analyzed the major parameters of designed fpjb are listed in table 2 fig 5 is the schematic diagram of fpjb the pressure plate mounted on the top of the box is designed to ensure seal performance and each of its mounting holes has o sealing rings the shield is installed on the pressure plate to protect the titanium film from external objects suppose sea surface temperature is 28 6 c and the pressure is 0 1013 mpa at the depth of 4000 m the temperature is 2 c the pressure is 40 mpa and the pre compression pressure is 0 1 mpa after two iterations of calculation table 3 displays the comparison results between without pre compression and with 0 1 mpa pre compression method apparently compared with the state without pre compression the 0 1 mpa pre compression compensation yields smaller maximum displacement and lower pressure difference after the second iteration the maximum displacement changes from 15 17 mm to 7 70 mm and the pressure difference from 0 76 mpa to 0 0996 mpa this proves that the pre compression improves reliability and compensation performance of the film 3 results and discussions the compensation performance of fpjb is determined by a number of factors as equation 24 indicates most of which are associated with environment and could hardly be adjusted properly designed parameters of fpbj would be of significant value for improving its compensation performance therefore in this section how the pre compression pressure the film thickness the initial volume of chamber and the residual gas content in hydraulic oil affect the pressure compensation performance is investigated via simulation 3 1 the pre compression pressure in this section first the relationship between depth and water temperature is fitted based on this how the maximum displacement and the pressure difference change along with the water depth under both conditions of with and without pre compression is analyzed additionally the method to calculate pre compression pressure is discussed it is known that underwater temperature is affected by many factors among which the geographic position water depth and time are predominant so far it remains challenging to map the accurate relationship between water depth and environmental temperature in this paper real time data collected from argo in china internal id number 0092 section number 226 were applied to demonstrate this relationship and an exponential function is selected to fit the data as displayed in fig 6 china argo real time data center 2018 the formula for fitting the curve is 26 t 27 72 e 0 0027 d 2 by combining equation 26 with equation 24 the relationship between the maximum displacement and the depth can be obtained and plotted under both conditions of with or without pre compression as illustrated in fig 7 1 in the same principle combining equation 26 with equation 25 the relationship between the pressure difference and the depth is displayed in fig 7 2 as shown in fig 7 1 when without pre compression the maximum displacement climbs up rapidly before 1000 m depth then slows down the pace and reaches 15 23 mm at 4000 m depth this is caused first by the compression of residual gas in hydraulic oil and second by the increased oil density due to temperature drop when with 0 1 mpa pre compression the maximum displacement decreases from the initial value 7 59 mm to 0 at the depth of 460 m and then goes up and reaches 7 71 mm at 4000 m on the whole the maximum displacement with pre compression is significantly lower than that without pre compression fig 7 2 describes how the pressure difference varies with depths without pre compression the pressure difference steadily increases and approaches 0 8 mpa however with 0 1 mpa pre compression pressure the pressure difference first drops to zero and then slowly climbs up and reaches 0 1 mpa at 4000 m apparently 0 1 mpa pre compression pressure helps to significantly decrease the pressure difference note that excessive pre compression would cause the damage of film the method to calculate the appropriate pre compression pressure is discussed as follows to minimize the maximum film displacement in diving processes fig 8 1 is used to depict the relationship between initial displacement and pre compression pressure and the relationship between the displacement in working state with 4000 m depth and pre compression pressure obviously the initial displacement and the working state displacement change with an opposite trend the intersection point with the displacement of 7 71 mm corresponds to 0 1 mpa pre compression pressure at this point the maximum displacement has the minimum value because the maximum displacement is the larger one of these two displacements moreover fig 8 2 further proves that when the pre compression pressure is 0 1 mpa its corresponding pressure difference is within 0 2 mpa and acceptable therefore 0 1 mpa was regarded as the appropriate pre compression pressure value 3 2 film thickness the maximum displacement and the pressure difference under different film thicknesses at 4000 m depth can be calculated according to equations 24 and 25 respectively the results of with and without pre compression pressure are displayed in fig 9 when without pre compression the maximum displacement slowly increases from 14 97 mm to 15 57 mm along with the increasing thickness with 0 1 mpa pre compression pressure the maximum displacement increases from initial 5 58 mm 10 77 mm overall compared with the state without pre compression the maximum displacement is significantly reduced with 0 1 mpa pre compression pressure furthermore in fig 9 2 in both cases the pressure difference has a nearly linear relationship with the film thickness the value changes from 0 365 mpa to 4 11 mpa without pre compression and from 0 0189 mpa to 1 36 mpa with 0 1 mpa pre compression pressure fig 9 proves the validity of pre compression and shows that the thinner film possess better compensation performance taking the film strength into consideration 1 mm film thickness is selected in the prototype 3 3 initial volume of fpjb the maximum displacement and the pressure difference at a 4000 m depth were calculated for different initial volumes according to equations 24 and 25 and are displayed respectively in fig 10 the maximum displacement increases linearly in with and without pre compression conditions as initial volume increases also the pressure difference increases in both conditions compared with the state without pre compression the pre compression state has lower value in the maximum displacement and the pressure difference thus provides a better compensation performance of fpjb apart from the initial volume the volume occupied by internal components and the inward protrusion volume of the film should also be considered the initial volume is set to 7 5 10 3 m3 in the prototype when taking all the factors into consideration 3 4 residual gas content in hydraulic oil the maximum displacement and the pressure difference at 4000 m depth were calculated for different residual gas content in hydraulic oil according to equations 24 and 25 and displayed in fig 11 respectively as displayed in fig 11 1 the maximum displacement increases linearly with and without pre compression and the pressure difference increases with the increasing of residual gas content apparently the residual gas content significantly affects compensation performance specifically the less the residual gas content in the hydraulic oil is the better the compensation performance could be provided by fpjb the residual gas in the hydraulic oil should be minimized and be accurately measured so that the compensation performance can be analyzed better in this paper the residual gas content is minimized and controlled within 1 in the oil injection process and in the simulation analysis it is set to be 1 4 high pressure chamber tests the fpjb prototype is displayed in fig 12 to verify its feasibility and reliability the prototype was tested in a high pressure chamber at the state key laboratory of fluid power and mechatronics in china as pictured in fig 13 the maximum work pressure of the chamber is 60 mpa a pressure impact test was to evaluate fpjb s feasibility and reliability and a pressure retaining test was to verify the pressure keeping property of fpjb the test steps were listed as follows 1 inject hydraulic oil into the fpjb chamber to minimize the residual gas content and preload pressure until it reaches 0 2 mpa 2 fix fpjb to the high pressure chamber bracket and inject water into the high pressure chamber place the bracket at the bottom and cover the chamber lid to ensure sealing of the high pressure chamber 3 switch on the valve and pump and inject water into the high pressure chamber to drain the remaining gas 4 switch off the valve and continuously inject water into the high pressure chamber until the pressure reaches 45 mpa 5 the pressure is maintained for a period after that switch on the valve to let internal pressure drop to environmental pressure in total 20 compression tests were carried out as mapped in fig 14 two of them were purposed to maintain 45 mpa pressure for more than 10 h the rest tests lasted less than 10 min each time the internal pressure of fpjb before and after the tests remained the same compared with the initial value 66331 g the weight of fpjb after tests increased by only 8 g which could be almost ignored therefore the high pressure chamber tests further verify fpjb pressure keeping property feasibility and reliability 5 conclusions in this paper a pre compression method is proposed to improve the pressure compensation performance of fpjb and the relationship between water depth and pressure difference is established with the consideration of oil compressibility and residual gas content several factors that affect the compensation performance of fpjb are analyzed via simulation the prototype fpjb in a high pressure chamber is also tested to verify its reliability and sealing performance both the simulation and the chamber test results indicate that 1 the pre compression method would significantly improve the reliability and compensation performance of fpjb 2 the best pre compression pressure is the pressure that makes the initial displacement and working state displacement equal thinner film thickness smaller initial volume and lower residual gas content would improve the compensation performance of fpjb these characteristics are considered to be an important reference for the similar instruments design however there is still space to improve for example the proposed pre compression method requires working depth to be constant this might not be suitable for underwater vehicles which frequently changes working depth additionally this study only conducted pressure experiments for performance evaluation in the laboratory in the future sea experiments would be conducted to test the performance of fpjb

22504,in the present paper the hydrodynamic performance of a linear array of truncated circular cylinders in front of a bottom mounted vertical wall is analysed in the frequency domain in order to investigate the effect of the wave reflections combined with the disturbances induced by the bodies themselves infinite and finite length wall cases are examined and compared the former case is formulated and solved using the matched eigenfunction expansion technique and the direct solution methodology for the numerical implementation the existence of a pure wave reflecting wall of infinite length is considered by utilizing the method of images for the finite length wall cases the conventional boundary integral equation bie formulation is employed emphasis is given on a revealing the limitations of the infinite wall concept on the calculation of the exciting forces acting on the cylinders of the array and b investigating the effect of the length of the wall on the aforementioned physical quantities the results demonstrate that the infinite wall concept leads to under or over estimation of the heave exciting forces at small wave numbers while this concept seems not to be adequate for the accurate calculation of the horizontal exciting forces in cases of small outer cylinder s center to wall s edge distance the change of the wall s length affects the surge and the heave exciting forces while the presence of the wall contrary to the case of the isolated array leads to an intense variation pattern of the cylinders sway exciting forces this pattern is characterized by successive local minima which can be related to the existence of a symmetrical wave field in the seaward and leeward sides of the cylinders keywords wave diffraction wave structure interaction array of truncated cylinders vertical wall method of images wave exciting forces 1 introduction contemporary technological advances seek the exploitation of wave energy autonomously or in combination with wind energy in offshore hybrid systems wave energy extraction is admittedly in embryonic or at least in pre commercial stage several concepts have been proposed for which experience and practice showed that there are several challenges associated with wave energy systems that must be properly addressed among the various devices of wave energy converters wecs suggested and implemented to some extent in reality oscillating water columns owcs and point absorbers pas appear to be the most promising owcs are suitable and are seen in combination with existing infrastructures such as ship berthing places in ports or with non conventional breakwaters e g boccotti 2007 contestabile et al 2017 di lauro et al 2019 nonetheless arrays of owcs combined with prospective floating platforms for offshore wind turbines have also been analysed konispoliatis and mavrakos 2016 on the other hand pas are devices which typically intend to absorb wave energy through their heaving motion the mechanism for wave energy harvesting is easy to conceive while for increased energy production multi module clusters arrays are suggested which unavoidably lead to a complicated hydrodynamic performance of the individual modules and the array due to the hydrodynamic interactions between the modules the geometry of the absorbers is simple e g circular cylinders although the shape of the effective area the bottom or the lower area in the case of cylinders which converts the hydrodynamic pressure into a heaving force and accordingly to energy and power could be more complicated and is a matter of concern at any rate what it is always required is the increased performance and the obvious solution to that is the formation of multi body arrays with an optimum configuration in terms of the number of solids their relative locations dimensions and spacings the problem of the hydrodynamic interactions between arrays of cylindrical bodies has a long history behind it while aside from the practical dimension of the phenomenon it has intrigued engineering intellectuality toward state of the art aspects such as mode trapping phenomena e g callan et al 1991 evans et al 1994 evans and porter 1999 linton and evans 1990 meylan and eatock taylor 2009 maniar and newman 1997 to mention some of the most important works on the subject most of the studies concern bottom mounted cylinders there have been studies however that extend the investigation to floating finite draught bodies siddorn and eatock taylor 2008 wolgamot et al 2015 chatjigeorgiou et al 2019 or to arrays of bottomless cylinders chatjigeorgiou 2018a with always a focus on the sought enhancement of the hydrodynamic performance of arrays of pas of cylindrical shape a technique that has not attracted yet sufficient attention is the use of a barrier say a wall in front of the array that could cause by force the superposition of the incoming with the reflected waves that way one could expect in the explicitly hypothetical case the generation of waves with increased amplitude known also as standing waves the formation of standing waves however is simply a theoretical perspective of explicitly academic interest this is due to the fact that pure reflection of the incoming waves by the wall is required making a wave that is travelling nowhere and has a double amplitude this assumption unavoidably leads to peculiar conclusions say double heaving forces of hydrostatic nature for very long waves as the wave frequency tends to zero further the assumption of a pure reflection generates a standing wave that occupies the entire control volume the latter remark is in contrast with the actual phenomenon which merely implies that the waves are diffracted by the wall generating hydrodynamic disturbance which accordingly interacts with the incoming waves creating eventually a complicated wave field pure reflection could be considered as a possible outcome but only for infinite walls however no infinite walls exist in reality in addition pure wave reflection and creation of standing waves assume by default a wall that bounds the entire control volume from the seabed up to the free surface the question which easily arises is therefore associated with the actual impact of the wall as an obstacle to the wave propagation and whether this barrier could serve as a technique for improved hydrodynamic performance aiming to exploit the heaving forces exerted on the cylinders which are accordingly converted to heaving motions and eventually to power relevant answers could be given by the solution of the hydrodynamic diffraction problem by arrays of cylinders in front of a vertical wall of finite length and assumingly infinitesimal thickness also an important question is connected with the alteration of the hydrodynamic behaviour of the array having the wall s length as a parameter to the underlying problem the solution of the hydrodynamic diffraction problem by arrays of cylinders without any kind of wall barrier in the control volume of the liquid is well treated in the literature most of the existing studies treat unavoidably the linear problem and there is only one analytically based study reported in the literature that treats the second order in wave steepness problem by arrays of bottom mounted cylinders malenica et al 1999 the analytical elaboration of a relevant wall diffraction problem with a cylindrical array involves a great number of challenges to be addressed which are mainly associated with the different coordinate systems to be considered the simultaneous employment of the neumann condition on the solids in polar for the cylinders and cartesian for the wall coordinates is impossible an advisable solution would be to consider the wall as an elliptical cylinder with zero semi minor axis this approach was taken by chatjigeorgiou and molin 2013 but for an isolated plate without interactions of any other kind at any rate analytical approaches although they yield elegant formulas and very fast algorithms they have limitations in convergence the convergence properties are related to the required distances between the bodies so that the governing addition theorems which must be employed become operational the body spacings are incorporated into the addition theorems while small spacings result in divergence the number of modes harmonics of the laplace equation is not actually a problem for the solution aside of course from the fact that great mode numbers require great cpu times an alternative option to examine the concerned wall problem is the method of images in this method the existence of the wall in front of the bodies is assimilated by considering an array consisting of the actual modules and their images fictitious modules situated symmetrically on the other side of the wall the approach is completed by taking into consideration the actual wave train that propagates say at angle β with respect to the horizontal and the pure reflected wave train that propagates at angle 180 o β the approach of the images assumes by default a pure wave reflection which in the context also of the linear potential theory is valid only for an infinite length wall that extends all the way from the bottom up to the free surface among the few existing studies that adopted the concerned approximation are those due to teng and ning 2003 teng et al 2004 and zheng and zhang 2015 who investigated a single body and apparently its image in front of an infinite wall in the same context mavrakos et al 2004 investigated the wave diffraction by an array of five circular cylinders in front of a wall of infinite extend in the latter study the cylinders were considered as pas wecs with an aim to exploit the combined diffraction wave field for wave energy extraction since the early study of mciver and evans 1988 who developed an approximate theory for the performance of a number of wave energy devices set into a reflecting wall admittedly there are not many works dealing with the concerned concept recent examples are the studies of ning et al 2018 and zhao et al 2019 the former study considered a system of eleven bodies in front of a very long pontoon both circular cylinders and hemispheres were examined as possible wecs in the experimental study of zhao et al 2019 a pa wec system composed by circular cylinders in front of a vertical pontoon was investigated the sides of the rectangular pontoon were attached to the sides of the flume simulating consequently a very long wall ocean walls however cannot be infinite in that respect it is crucial to investigate the changes in the hydrodynamic performance of arrays of cylindrical pas situated close to a wall to exploit the diffracted wave field the recommended effort should account for the hypothetical case of an infinite wall and realistic cases of walls of finite lengths having the latter as a variable parameter it should be mentioned that differences should be expected for finite and infinite length walls and accordingly the latter condition should be employed with care in realistic applications where the cylindrical bodies are considered as energy absorbers for exploiting their heaving motion the modules of the array should be placed relatively close to the wall their actual location should be rather a matter of optimization although relevant challenges are not considered herein the specific context discourages the employment of analytical approaches given the convergence problems associated with the spacings between the bodies and between the bodies and the wall in the present paper we examine with one single effort the hydrodynamic performance of arrays of cylindrical bodies situated close to a wall to investigate the effect of the wave reflections combined with the disturbances induced by the bodies themselves comparisons are made between the infinite and the finite length wall cases the former case is formulated and solved using semi analytical considerations of the hydrodynamic boundary value problem based on the matched eigenfunction expansion technique and the direct solution methodology chatjigeorgiou 2018a chatjigeorgiou et al 2019 for the finite length wall cases we relied on the conventional boundary integral equation bie formulation using the respected code wamit wamitinc 2006 2 problem s set up an array of q mutually interacting truncated identical circular cylinders of radius b and of draft d are placed in an area of finite and constant water depth h in front of a bottom mounted vertical wall of finite length l w and of negligible thickness fig 1 the cylinders are distributed uniformly within the array with a center to center spacing between two successive cylinders equal to 2 l while all cylinders are placed at a distance c from the wall fig 1 a the array and the wall experience the action of monochromatic incident waves of linear amplitude a and of circular frequency ω that propagate at angle β with respect to the horizontal x axis all cylinders are assumed restrained in waves and thus only the diffraction problem is considered the hydrodynamic analysis of the array of the cylinders including hydrodynamic interaction effects among the cylinders and between the wall and the cylinders is performed in the frequency domain and it is based on 3d wave diffraction theory assuming inviscid and incompressible fluid and irrotational flow the velocity potential is introduced for describing the fluid motion with harmonic time dependence expressed as e i ω t where t denotes time the leading order linear boundary value problem is formed and solved by utilizing two different approaches the first one includes an analytical formulation of the unknown diffraction potentials using eigenfunction expansions and the utilization of the matched technique for obtaining the relevant unknown expansions coefficients chatjigeorgiou 2018a chatjigeorgiou et al 2019 for taking into account the vertical bottom mounted wall the method of images is applied e g mavrakos et al 2004 assuming therefore the existence of a pure wave reflecting wall of infinite length the second approach is based on the boundary integral equation bie formulation utilizing the green s theorem and using a three dimensional low order panel method for solving the integral equations for the unknown diffraction potentials on the wetted surface of the bodies lee and newman 2004 finite length wall effects are considered in this case 2 1 formulation and solution of the diffraction problem by a multi body arrangement the complete solution of the hydrodynamic diffraction problem by arrays of multiple circular truncated cylinders using the matched eigenfunction expansion technique combined with the direct method of approach for the numerical implementation has been thoroughly described in chatjigeorgiou 2018a and chatjigeorgiou et al 2019 for the consistence of the presentation and making the analysis self contained we outline herein the basic steps of the procedure the geometry of each cylinder q 1 q in the array defines two liquid regions the outer region a that extends to infinity and contains all other cylinders j q of the array and the lower region b below each cylinder using a local polar coordinate system r q θ q z fixed on the center of cylinder q the vertical z coordinate is common for all cylinders and it is assumed fixed on the bottom pointing vertically upwards the regions a and b are contained within r q b 0 θ q

bottom conditions eq 7 is the zero velocity condition on the underneath area of each cylinder while eq 4 is the neumann body condition on the impermeable wetted area of the q th cylinder since for each cylinder two liquid regions have been defined eqs 1 4 and eqs 5 7 should by satisfied by the discrete velocity potentials ϕ a and ϕ b describing the wave fields in regions a and b respectively the uniqueness of the solution requires matching the potentials ϕ a and ϕ b in the mutual surface boundary r q b 0 θ q 2 π and 0 z h 1 namely 8 ϕ a r q ϕ b r q r q b 0 θ q 2 π 0 z h 1 9 ϕ a ϕ b r q b

second independent radial solution depending on i m a n r q has been omitted the sum term in eq 10 that describes the diffracted wave field induced by all bodies in the array except cylinder q should be regarded as an incident wave field with complicated structure that hits the cylinder q moreover eq 10 combines all local polar coordinate systems r j θ j j 1 q for employing the neumann condition of eq 4 and the continuity relations of eqs 8 and 9 the various diffraction components for j q initially expressed in terms of the local system r j θ j j q should be expressed with respect to the local coordinate system r q θ q of the randomly selected cylinder q in the array to this end graf s addition theorem will be required which for the modified bessel function of the second kind and the

is referred to the recent book of chatjigeorgiou 2018b eq 2 125 p 66 accordingly eq 10 obtains the following extended form that describes the infinite wave field outside the random cylinder q 17 ϕ a m

values for n 0 and very large values of n otherwise eq 18 is always bounded given that in the lower liquid region r q b in eq 18 ε 0 1 and ε n 2 n 1 2 is the neumann symbol or jacobi factor while finally f m n q q 1 q denote the unknown expansion coefficients which are calculated together with c m n q q 1 q by invoking the neumann condition eq 4 and the continuity relations of eqs 8 and 9 the unknown expansion coefficients f m n q and c m n q q 1 q are obtained by utilizing the matched eigenfunctions technique chatjigeorgiou 2018a the final system is relatively complicated and its details are omitted at any rate the system is linear and can be put in a convenient complex matrix form to be solved using standard matrix techniques clearly the system must be truncated to account for a finite number of harmonics m m m and a finite number of vertical eigenfunctions n 0 n for both expressions 17 and 18 the number of modes and eigenfunctions depend on the accuracy of the convergence required typically a small number of modes and eigenfunctions less than five each is sufficient to provide convergent results having solved the diffraction problem the linear exciting forces are obtained by direct pressure integration on the wetted surface of the cylinders in the case of the surge and sway exciting forces the potential ϕ a eq 17 is employed while the heave exciting forces are calculated by utilizing the potential ϕ b eq 18 hence the surge f x q sway f y q and heave f z q exciting forces acting on the q th cylinder of the array are obtained by 19 f x q f y q ρ g a b h 1 h 0

relatively complicated and again their details are omitted full details of these formulas can be found in chatjigeorgiou 2018a and chatjigeorgiou et al 2019 the preceding analysis corresponds to an array of q cylinders without the presence of the wall isolated array the presence of a vertical bottom mounted wall is realized by the method of images mavrakos et al 2004 which immediately and unavoidably leads to the consideration of a pure wave reflection by a wall of infinite extent more specifically the problem under investigation fig 1 is considered equivalent to the hydrodynamic problem of the array of q cylinders and their images array of q virtual cylinders with respect to the vertical wall under the action of waves without the presence of the wall fig 2 the diffraction problem for the 2 q cylinders is then solved considering the action of two incident wave trains propagating at angles β and 180 o β with respect to the horizontal x axis fig 2 2 2 bie formulation the second approach taken in the present paper relies on the bie formulation of the velocity potential and is numerically realized using the code wamit 2006 which is employed for arbitrary shaped bodies hence a vertical wall of finite length can be incorporated into the array of the hydrodynamically interacting bodies the boundary value problem that is considered in the bie approach is composed by the laplace equation e g eq 1 in the entire volume of liquid on either side of the finite length wall the free surface condition eq 2 and the bottom condition eq 3 the cartesian representation of the incident wave component is taken from the first member of the right hand side of eq 11 while the neumann condition to be applied on the wetted surfaces of all bodies participating in the array including the wall will read 21 ϕ n 0 where the unit vector n is normal to each body s boundary and points out of the fluid domain it is noted that in the case of the bie formulation all equations are defined using a global coordinate system as shown in fig 1 but with its origin located on the free surface the boundary integral equations for the unknown diffraction velocity potential on the boundary of all bodies cylinders and wall are formed using the green s theorem and the boundary value problem is solved based on a three dimensional low order panel method lee and newman 2004 it is noted that since the thickness of the wall is negligible zero thickness dipole panels lee and newman 2004 are used for modelling the wetted surface of the wall finally the exciting forces are obtained via direct pressure integration on the wetted surfaces of all bodies q 1 q namely 22 f l q i ω ρ s b q n l ϕ d s l x y z where s b q is the wetted surface of the q th cylinder while n x n y and n z are the components of the normal vector n along the x y and z directions respectively the exciting forces acting on the wall can also be calculated in a similar manner it is finally mentioned that the version of wamit used in the present paper enables the consideration of an infinite length wall by utilizing the method of images only for the case of a single body this capability has been exploited for validating the present semi analytical formulation as described in the subsequent section 2 3 validation of the present semi analytical formulation the semi analytical formulation outlined in section 2 1 is validated for the case of a single cylinder by comparing results with the corresponding ones obtained using the bie formulation assuming the existence of an infinite length wall i e l w utilization of the method of images the cylinder has radius b 1 m non dimensional draft d b 2 while it is placed at non dimensional distance from the wall c b equal to 4 comparison is made in terms of the non dimensional sway f y and heave f z exciting forces values are normalized by ρ g a b 2 and ρ g a π b 2 respectively and the relevant results are shown in fig 3 it can be easily seen that the results of the present semi analytical formulation show an excellent agreement with the corresponding ones obtained using the bie formulation 3 results and discussion 3 1 general remarks the numerical methods outlined in section 2 are applied for the case of an array of five identical cylinders q 5 in fig 1 of radius b 1 m and of non dimensional draft d b 2 the cylinders are distributed uniformly within the array with non dimensional center to center spacing 2 l b 4 and non dimensional distance from the wall c b 4 in the case of the bie formulation four different values of non dimensional wall length l w b are examined equal to 18 36 72 and 108 if l 1 denotes the distance between the centres of the two outer cylinders in the array with the corresponding edges of the wall fig 1 the aforementioned l w b values correspond to l 1 b 1 10 28 and 46 respectively the array and the wall are considered in an area of non dimensional depth h b 10 and are subjected to monochromatic incident waves with β 270 o fig 1 the non dimensional wave number k 0 b varies between 0 01 and 4 0 in the case of the bie formulation the wetted surface of each cylinder was modeled using 1600 panels while the wall for all l w b values examined was modeled using 1600 dipole panels i e 9600 panels were considered in total the aforementioned number of panels has been defined based on appropriate convergence tests aiming at combing numerical accuracy with computational efficiency for 9600 panels in total the average computational time per wave number for achieving converge in the solution was equal to 107 s 166 s 170 s and 188 s for l w b 18 36 72 and 108 respectively using a standard pc with i7 7500u 2 7 ghz processor in the following subsections attention shall be given to a revealing the limitations of the method of images assumption of an infinite length wall and b investigating the effect of l w b on the exciting forces acting on the cylinders of the array results corresponding to an isolated array are also cited in order to illustrate more clearly the effect of the presence of the wall on the exciting forces exerted on the cylinders the surge and sway exciting forces are given normalized by ρ g a b 2 while the heave forces have been normalized by ρ g a π b 2 it is also noted that the abbreviations cyl1 cyl2 cyl5 fig 1 are used for denoting the cylinders in the array with cyl3 being the middle cylinder of the array while the symmetry of the array with respect to the examined incident wave direction leads to the same exiting forces for cyl1 and cyl5 outer cylinders and for cyl2 and cyl4 3 2 exciting forces on the cylinders for the infinite wall case in figs 4 11 the surge f x sway f y and heave f z exciting forces on the cylinders of the array are calculated analytically assuming l w method of images those are compared with the corresponding results obtained via the bie formulation for the case of a finite length wall of l w b 18 and l w b 108 starting with the surge forces figs 4 5 non zero values of f x exist for cylq q 1 2 4 and 5 as a result of the hydrodynamic interactions among the cylinders and between the wall and the cylinders while due to the symmetry of the configuration with respect to β 270 o f x for cyl3 is cancelled for all l w cases considered and for all cylq q 1 2 4 and 5 an intense variation of f x relative to the nondimensional wave number is observed which is characterized by an irregular pattern and the existence of multiple sharp peaks and successive local minima especially up to k 0 b 2 the results for the surge force obtained for the case of the infinite wall agree quite well with the corresponding results for l w b 108 which represents a wall of large length with large outer cylinder s center to wall s edge distance l 1 b 46 it should be remarked however that differences do exist even when assuming a lengthy but not actually infinite wall since in the former case and contrary to l w wall edge effects still exist it is therefore evident that the infinite wall assumption simulated by the method of images should be used with absolute care for the case of l w b 18 the edge finite length effects of the small length wall with l 1 b 1 have a direct impact on f x leading therefore to significant differences in the variation pattern and the values of f x compared e g to the case of the infinite l w especially within the intervals 0 01 k 0 b 1 3 for cylq q 1 and q 5 fig 4 and at 0 01 k 0 b 2 0 for cylq q 2 and q 4 fig 5 regarding sway exciting forces figs 6 8 for all l w cases considered herein and for all cylq q 1 5 the variation pattern for f y is characterized by the existence of five successive peaks at k 0 b 0 4 1 1 2 0 2 8 and 3 5 respectively with successively decreasing values towards higher frequencies the overall trends between finite and infinite vertical wall cases are similar for the sway forces for the inner cylinders of the array i e cylq q 2 3 and 4 figs 7 8 the infinite wall assumption does not lead to significant differences for sway forces compared to both l w 18 and l w 108 same conclusions can be drawn for the outer cylinders of the array fig 6 but only for the large length case for the small length case wall edge effects seem to have an impact on f y for the case of cyl1 and cyl5 and for k 0 b 1 5 where smaller peak values for l w b 18 are observed compared to the infinite wall the heave exciting forces figs 9 11 exhibit very interesting characteristics wall reflections induce significant effects on f z for all cylq q 1 5 and for all l w cases considered in the interval 0 01 k 0 b 1 0 while at k 0 b 1 0 f z becomes practically zero in the case of the infinite l w f z from the maximum value of 2 at k 0 b 0 01 decreases smoothly up to k 0 b 0 35 where it obtains a local minimum with a value almost equal to zero a small increase of f z follows resulting to non zero f z values up to k 0 b 1 0 it is worth to note that the existence of the maximum value of 2 at k 0 b 0 01 is related to the assumption of pure wave reflection by the infinite length wall this is not observed for the cases of l w b 18 and 108 where a finite length wall as exists in practical real world applications has been taken into account specifically for l w b 18 and contrary to the infinite l w the variation of f z starts from the limiting value of 1 at k 0 b 0 01 as in the case of the isolated array see figs 17 a 19a below and it is characterized by a smooth increase up to k 0 b 0 15 where the peak of f z occurs this behaviour leads in turn to a smaller f z values for cylq q 1 5 at 0 01 k 0 b 0 1 and b larger f z values for cylq q 2 3 and 4 at 0 1 k 0 b 0 3 compared to the case of the infinite l w on the other hand for l w b 108 and again contrary to the infinite l w f z is characterized by the occurrence of two successive peaks at 0 01 k 0 b 0 6 the first one global maximum is observed at k 0 b 0 03 as a result of the rapid increase of f z from the value of 1 25 at k 0 b 0 01 while the second peak local maximum occurs at k 0 b 0 15 subsequently larger f z values especially at 0 02 k 0 b 0 1 are observed for cylq q 1 5 compared to the case of the infinite l w for the rest examined k 0 b range the variation of f z for each cylinder in the array and for both l w b 18 and 108 is analogous with the variation of the corresponding heave exciting force obtained for the case of the infinite l w according to the preceding discussion it could be said that the infinite wall assumption exhibits limitations regarding the accurate estimation of the cylinders heave exciting forces in the low frequency range since the assumption of a pure wave reflecting wall of infinite length leads to under or over estimation of the aforementioned physical quantities additionally the assumption of an infinite length wall seems not to be adequate for the calculation of the horizontal forces in the case of small length vertical walls with small l 1 b ratios where edge effects significantly affect the cylinders surge exciting forces as well as the sway exciting forces on the outer cylinders of the array 3 3 the effect of wall s length on the exciting forces acting on the cylinders the effect of l w b on the exciting forces applied on the cylinders of the array is discussed with the aid of figs 12 and 13 and 14a 19a which depict the variation of f x f y and f z obtained by the bie formulation as a function of k 0 b for l w b 18 36 72 and 108 in these figures results corresponding to an isolated array are also shown for demonstrating more clearly the effect of the presence of the wall on the cylinders exciting forces for all l w b cases examined the hydrodynamic interactions among the cylinders of the array and between the cylinders and the wall lead to non zero surge exciting forces for cylq q 1 2 4 and 5 figs 12 and 13 which vary following a profound irregular pattern the significant impact of the wall edge effects on the surge exciting forces for l w b 18 leads to a different variation and largest peak values of f x at 0 01 k 0 b 1 0 for cylq q 1 and 5 fig 12 and at 0 01 k 0 b 2 0 for cylq q 2 and 4 fig 13 compared to the rest l w b ratios examined herein furthermore the increase of l w b from 36 to 108 leads to a small decrease of the f x peak values at 0 01 k 0 b 1 6 mainly for the outer cylinders of the array fig 12 while the opposite holds true for the largest examined k 0 b values finally compared to the isolated cylinder for all cylq q 1 2 4 and 5 and for all l w b values examined a more intense variation of f x as a function of k 0 b is observed demonstrating the impact of the presence of the wall and of the wall edge effects on the surge exciting forces moving on to the sway exciting forces figs 14a 16 a it can be seen that the increase of l w b has an insignificant effect on the values and the variation pattern of f y for the inner cylinders of the array cylq q 2 3 and 4 figs 15a 16a this also holds true for the outer cylinders cylq q 1 and 5 fig 14 a except for the case of l w b 18 for this l w b value the existence of a small center to wall edge distance l 1 b 1 leads to smaller peak values of f y at k 0 b 1 5 compared to the rest l w b cases contrary the isolated array where for each cylq q 1 5 f y varies smoothly the presence of the wall irrespectively of its length leads to an intense variation pattern of the sway exciting forces characterized by the existence of multiple distinctive local minima at k 0 b 0 85 1 5 2 4 3 2 and 4 and thus of multiple peaks at k 0 b 0 4 1 1 2 0 2 8 and 3 5 with successively decreasing values towards higher frequencies recalling that c denotes the distance between the centres of the cylinders and the wall fig 1 the non dimensional wave numbers where the aforementioned local minima occur correspond to characteristic values of the c l ratio with l being the wave length approximately equal to 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 respectively from a physical point of view the f y local minima can be related to the formation of characteristic patterns of the diffracted wave field around the cylinders at these c l values as commended in the next section regarding the heave exciting forces figs 17a 19 a for all cylinders of the array the change of l w b has a significant effect on f z at 0 01 k 0 b 0 2 for l w b 18 the variation of f z begins from the limiting value of 1 at k 0 b 0 01 as in the case of the isolated array and it is characterized by a smooth increase up to k 0 b 0 15 where the peak of f z occurs then f z decreases smoothly up to k 0 b 0 35 where it obtains a local minimum with value close to zero the same variation pattern is observed for the rest examined l w b cases however by increasing successively the length of the wall a more rapid increase of f z at k 0 b 0 2 is observed therefore the f z peak is successively shifted to smaller frequencies i e at k 0 b 0 1 0 04 and 0 03 for l w b 36 72 and 108 respectively moreover for l w b 108 and contrary to the rest l w b cases a local maximum occurs at k 0 b 0 15 it should be also noted that the increase of l w b leads to larger f z peak values finally the results of figs 17 a 19a demonstrate clearly that the presence of the wall irrespectively of its length affects significantly the heave exciting forces of all the cylinders in the array at 0 01 k 0 b 1 0 since in this frequency range and for all l w b values examined f z does not show the continuous smooth decrease as in the case of the isolated array overall the heave exciting forces should be examined and discussed relative to the limiting value for zero wave frequency for isolated cylinders or for an isolated array without the effect of reflections by a wall the limiting value using the present normalization which is of hydrostatic nature tends to unity subsequently it drops rapidly until is practically cancelled the existence of an infinite wall induces a pure reflection generating a non travelling wave with double amplitude and accordingly provokes double amplitude heave forces again at the zero frequency limiting case given that no pure reflection should be expected in real world applications having a double amplitude vertical hydrodynamic load should be considered as a course approximation for finite length walls the heave forces on the cylinders should start from the hydrostatic unity as indeed is implied in figs 17 a 19a nonetheless the waves diffracted by the wall induce profound amplifications of the heave loads which for lengthy walls e g l w b 108 exceed the hydrostatic double amplitude and reach the value of 2 5 the same behaviour is observed for more realistic situations e g l w b 18 where the heave force is increased above 1 5 of π ρ g a b 2 it is mentioned that the heave forces amplification interval involves productive wave frequencies as well e g 0 5 k 0 b 1 0 different array configurations may result in stronger force magnifications implying that the wec concept in front of a vertical wall represents a problem of optimization in terms of the number of solids the configuration of the array the relative placements and obviously the involved dimensions accordingly the existence of a wall in front of an array of point absorbers could be an effective mechanism for enhancing wave energy harvesting finally considering the phases of the cylinders exciting forces figs 14 b 16b and 17b 19b show indicatively the variation of the phases of f y and f z receptively obtained by the bie formulation as a function of k 0 b for l w b 18 36 72 and 108 it can be seen that the change of l w b has an insignificant effect on the phases of f y figs 14 b 16b while this change affects the phases of f z figs 17 b 19b mainly at k 0 b 2 0 depending upon the position of the cylinder in the array on the other hand the presence of the wall irrespectively of its length affects the phases of the sway and the heave exciting forces of all the cylinders since contrary to the case of the isolated array a more intense variation of the aforementioned quantities is observed 3 4 wave filed spatial variation for physically interpreting the occurrence of local minima in the case of the sway exciting forces figs 14 a 16a the spatial variation of the nondimensional wave elevation η α is considered specifically figs 20 and 21 show the η α spatial variation for l w b 18 and l w b 72 respectively calculated indicatively at two characteristics k 0 b values equal to 0 85 and 1 1 where the sway exciting forces of the cylinders obtain a local minimum and a local maximum respectively figs 14 a 16a for both examined l w b cases η α at k 0 b 1 1 figs 20 b and 21b varies intensively and has significant values along two distinctive longitudinal parallel to the wall zones located at the leeward and the seaward side of the cylinders however this is not observed for the case of k 0 b 0 85 figs 20 a and 21a where the existence of an incident wave corresponding to c l 0 5 leads to a diffracted wave field governed by an intense variation and maximum η α values mainly in the area confined between the cylinders of the array moreover for this k 0 b value the diffracted wave field in the area close to array i e 3 0 y 5 0 is almost symmetric for the inner cylinders cylq q 2 3 and 4 and for the outer cylinders in the case of l w b 72 with respect to their local x q axis the above advocate the existence of quite small f y values at k 0 b 0 85 contrary to the case of k 0 b 1 1 in absolute accord with the results of figs 14 a 16a finally compared to the isolated array fig 22 it is evident that for a given k 0 b value and for both l w b 18 and 72 the presence of the wall has a significant effect on the wave field leading to a totally different and more intense spatial variation of η α around the cylinders of the array 4 conclusions in the present paper the hydrodynamic behaviour of a linear array of mutually interacting truncated circular cylinders in front of a bottom mounted finite length vertical wall of negligible thickness is analysed in the frequency domain under the action of perpendicular monochromatic incident waves the diffraction problem is solved by utilizing two different approaches a semi analytical formulation which by default assumes a pure wave reflecting wall of infinite length method of images and a conventional bie formulation where finite length wall effects are taken into account focus is given on a revealing the limitations of the infinite wall concept on the calculation of the exciting forces acting on the cylinders of the array and b investigating the effect of l w b on the aforementioned physical quantities the main conclusions of the present investigation are the assumption of a pure wave reflecting wall of infinite length leads to an under or over estimation of the cylinders heave exciting forces at k 0 b 0 4 compared to the case where a finite length wall as exists in practical real world applications is taken into account thus the infinite wall concept shows limitations regarding the accurate estimation of the aforementioned physical quantities at small wave numbers the assumption of a pure wave reflecting infinite length seems not to be adequate for the calculation of the horizontal exciting forces in the presence of small length vertical walls with small outer cylinder s center to wall s edge distance where finite length effects have a significant impact on the cylinders surge exciting forces and the sway exciting forces of the array s outer cylinders for all l w b cases examined the surge exciting forces resulting from the hydrodynamic interactions among the cylinders of the array and between the cylinders and the wall show a profound irregular variation the change of l w b affects all cylinders surge exciting forces with the most significant differences observed for the smallest examined l w b value since in that case the existence of small outer cylinder s center to wall s edge distance leads to substantial wall edge effects compared to the isolated array the presence of a vertical bottom mounted finite length boundary in the leeward area of the array amplifies the hydrodynamic interactions within the array the change of l w b has an insignificant effect on the values and the variation pattern of the sway exciting forces for almost all the cylinders in the array contrary to the case of the isolated array the presence of the wall irrespectively of its length leads to an intense variation pattern of the cylinders sway exciting forces characterized by a continuous alternation of local maxima and minima the latter local minima occur at characteristic values of the c l ratio between the cylinders centres to wall distance and the incident wave length approximately equal to 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 at these c l values an intense spatial variation of the wave field in the area confined between the cylinders is observed while the wave field in the seaward and leeward sides of the cylinders shows symmetrical features with regard to the cylinders heave exciting forces the presence of the wall irrespectively of its length and again contrary to the isolated array leads to occurrences of peaks with values larger than 1 at k 0 b 0 01 as well as to amplifications of the heave exciting forces at specific wave number intervals up to k 0 b 1 0 the effect of l w b on the heave exciting forces is bounded at 0 01 k 0 b 0 2 where by increasing successively the length of the wall a more rapid increase of f z is observed leading therefore to a successive shift of the f z peak at smaller non dimensional wave numbers the present research can be further extended in order to examine the hydrodynamic behaviour of an array of heaving floating cylinders in front of a vertical bottom mounted wall of finite length the array s power absorption ability taking into account the motion phase differences among the cylinders as well as the potential of the occurrence of wave trapping phenomena the consideration of different than the linear array configurations of the cylinders in front of a wall and the determination of the optimum in terms of power absorption configuration present also interesting subjects for future investigation 
22504,in the present paper the hydrodynamic performance of a linear array of truncated circular cylinders in front of a bottom mounted vertical wall is analysed in the frequency domain in order to investigate the effect of the wave reflections combined with the disturbances induced by the bodies themselves infinite and finite length wall cases are examined and compared the former case is formulated and solved using the matched eigenfunction expansion technique and the direct solution methodology for the numerical implementation the existence of a pure wave reflecting wall of infinite length is considered by utilizing the method of images for the finite length wall cases the conventional boundary integral equation bie formulation is employed emphasis is given on a revealing the limitations of the infinite wall concept on the calculation of the exciting forces acting on the cylinders of the array and b investigating the effect of the length of the wall on the aforementioned physical quantities the results demonstrate that the infinite wall concept leads to under or over estimation of the heave exciting forces at small wave numbers while this concept seems not to be adequate for the accurate calculation of the horizontal exciting forces in cases of small outer cylinder s center to wall s edge distance the change of the wall s length affects the surge and the heave exciting forces while the presence of the wall contrary to the case of the isolated array leads to an intense variation pattern of the cylinders sway exciting forces this pattern is characterized by successive local minima which can be related to the existence of a symmetrical wave field in the seaward and leeward sides of the cylinders keywords wave diffraction wave structure

the mechanism for wave energy harvesting is easy to conceive while for increased energy production multi module clusters arrays are suggested which unavoidably lead to a complicated hydrodynamic performance of the individual modules and the array due to the hydrodynamic interactions between the modules the geometry of the absorbers is simple e g circular cylinders although the shape of the effective area the bottom or the lower area in the case of cylinders which converts the hydrodynamic pressure into a heaving force and accordingly to energy and power could be more complicated and is a matter of concern at any rate what it is always required is the increased performance and the obvious solution to that is the formation of multi body arrays with an optimum configuration in terms of the number of solids their relative locations dimensions and spacings the problem of the hydrodynamic interactions between arrays of cylindrical bodies has a long history behind it while aside from the practical dimension of the phenomenon it has intrigued engineering intellectuality toward state of the art aspects such as mode trapping phenomena e g callan et al 1991 evans et al 1994 evans and porter 1999 linton and evans 1990 meylan and eatock taylor 2009 maniar and newman 1997 to mention some of the most important works on the subject most of the studies concern bottom mounted cylinders there have been studies however that extend the investigation to floating finite draught bodies siddorn and eatock taylor 2008 wolgamot et al 2015 chatjigeorgiou et al 2019 or to arrays of bottomless cylinders chatjigeorgiou 2018a with always a focus on the sought enhancement of the hydrodynamic performance of arrays of pas of cylindrical shape a technique that has not attracted yet sufficient attention is the use of a barrier say a wall in front of the array that could cause by force the superposition of the incoming with the reflected waves that way one could expect in the explicitly hypothetical case the generation of waves with increased amplitude known also as standing waves the formation of standing waves however is simply a theoretical perspective of explicitly academic interest this is due to the fact that pure reflection of the incoming waves by the wall is required making a wave that is travelling nowhere and has a double amplitude this assumption unavoidably leads to peculiar conclusions say double heaving forces of hydrostatic nature for very long waves as the wave frequency tends to zero further the assumption of a pure reflection generates a standing wave that occupies the entire control volume the latter remark is in contrast with the actual phenomenon which merely implies that the waves are diffracted by the wall generating hydrodynamic disturbance which accordingly interacts with the incoming waves creating eventually a complicated wave field pure reflection could be considered as a possible outcome but only for infinite walls however no infinite walls exist in reality in addition pure wave reflection and creation of standing waves assume by default a wall that bounds the entire control volume from the seabed up to the free surface the question which easily arises is therefore associated with the actual impact of the wall as an obstacle to the wave propagation and whether this barrier could serve as a technique for improved hydrodynamic performance aiming to exploit the heaving forces exerted on the cylinders which are accordingly converted to heaving motions and eventually to power relevant answers could be given by the solution of the hydrodynamic diffraction problem by arrays of cylinders in front of a vertical wall of finite length and assumingly infinitesimal thickness also an important question is connected with the alteration of the hydrodynamic behaviour of the array having the wall s length as a parameter to the underlying problem the solution of the hydrodynamic diffraction problem by arrays of cylinders without any kind of wall barrier in the control volume of the liquid is well treated in the literature most of the existing studies treat unavoidably the linear problem and there is only one analytically based study reported in the literature that treats the second order in wave steepness problem by arrays of bottom mounted cylinders malenica et al 1999 the analytical elaboration of a relevant wall diffraction problem with a cylindrical array involves a great number of challenges to be addressed which are mainly associated with the different coordinate systems to be considered the simultaneous employment of the neumann condition on the solids in polar for the cylinders and cartesian for the wall coordinates is impossible an advisable solution would be to consider the wall as an elliptical cylinder with zero semi minor axis this approach was taken by chatjigeorgiou and molin 2013 but for an isolated plate without interactions of any other kind at any rate analytical approaches although they yield elegant formulas and very fast algorithms they have limitations in convergence the convergence properties are related to the required distances between the bodies so that the governing addition theorems which must be employed become operational the body spacings are incorporated into the addition theorems while small spacings result in divergence the number of modes harmonics of the laplace equation is not actually a problem for the solution aside of course from the fact that great mode numbers require great cpu times an alternative option to examine the concerned wall problem is the method of images in this method the existence of the wall in front of the bodies is assimilated by considering an array consisting of the actual modules and their images fictitious modules situated symmetrically on the other side of the wall the approach is completed by taking into consideration the actual wave train that propagates say at angle β with respect to the horizontal and the pure reflected wave train that propagates at angle 180 o β the approach of the images assumes by default a pure wave reflection which in the context also of the linear potential theory is valid only for an infinite length wall that extends all the way from the bottom up to the free surface among the few existing studies that adopted the concerned approximation are those due to teng and ning 2003 teng et al 2004 and zheng and zhang 2015 who investigated a single body and apparently its image in front of an infinite wall in the same context mavrakos et al 2004 investigated the wave diffraction by an array of five circular cylinders in front of a wall of infinite extend in the latter study the cylinders were considered as pas wecs with an aim to exploit the combined diffraction wave field for wave energy extraction since the early study of mciver and evans 1988 who developed an approximate theory for the performance of a number of wave energy devices set into a reflecting wall admittedly there are not many works dealing with the concerned concept recent examples are the studies of ning et al 2018 and zhao et al 2019 the former study considered a system of eleven bodies in front of a very long pontoon both circular cylinders and hemispheres were examined as possible wecs in the experimental study of zhao et al 2019 a pa wec system composed by circular cylinders in front of a vertical pontoon was investigated the sides of the rectangular pontoon were attached to the sides of the flume simulating consequently a very long wall ocean walls however cannot be infinite in that respect it is crucial to investigate the changes in the hydrodynamic performance of arrays of cylindrical pas situated close to a wall to exploit the diffracted wave field the recommended effort should account for the hypothetical case of an infinite wall and realistic cases of walls of finite lengths having the latter as a variable parameter it should be mentioned that differences should be expected for finite and infinite length walls and accordingly the latter condition should be employed with care in realistic applications where the cylindrical bodies are considered as energy absorbers for exploiting their heaving motion the modules of the array should be placed relatively close to the wall their actual location should be rather a matter of optimization although relevant challenges are not considered herein the specific context discourages the employment of analytical approaches given the convergence problems associated with the spacings between the bodies and between the bodies and the wall in the present paper we examine with one single effort the hydrodynamic performance of arrays of cylindrical bodies situated close to a wall to investigate the effect of the wave reflections combined with the disturbances induced by the bodies themselves comparisons are made between the infinite and the finite length wall cases the former case is formulated and solved using semi analytical considerations of the hydrodynamic boundary value problem based on the matched eigenfunction expansion technique and the direct solution methodology chatjigeorgiou 2018a chatjigeorgiou et al 2019 for the finite length wall cases we relied on the conventional boundary integral equation bie formulation using the respected code wamit wamitinc 2006 2 problem s set up an array of q mutually interacting truncated identical circular cylinders of radius b and of draft d are placed in an area of finite and constant water depth h in front of a bottom mounted vertical wall of finite length l w and of negligible thickness fig 1 the cylinders are distributed uniformly within the array with a center to center spacing between two successive cylinders equal to 2 l while all cylinders are placed at a distance c from the wall fig 1 a the array and the wall experience the action of monochromatic incident waves of linear amplitude a and of circular frequency ω that propagate at angle β with respect to the horizontal x axis all cylinders are assumed restrained in waves and thus only the diffraction problem is considered the hydrodynamic analysis of the array of the cylinders including hydrodynamic interaction effects among the cylinders and between the wall and the cylinders is performed in the frequency domain and it is based on 3d wave diffraction theory assuming inviscid and incompressible fluid and irrotational flow the velocity potential is introduced for describing the fluid motion with harmonic time dependence expressed as e i ω t where t denotes time the leading order linear boundary value problem is formed and solved by utilizing two different approaches the first one includes an analytical formulation of the unknown diffraction potentials using eigenfunction expansions and the utilization of the matched technique for obtaining the relevant unknown expansions coefficients chatjigeorgiou 2018a chatjigeorgiou et al 2019 for taking into account the vertical bottom mounted wall the method of images is applied e g mavrakos et al 2004 assuming therefore the existence of a pure wave reflecting wall of infinite length the second approach is based on the boundary integral equation bie formulation utilizing the green s theorem and using a three dimensional low order panel method for solving the integral equations for the unknown diffraction potentials on the wetted surface of the bodies lee and newman 2004 finite length wall effects are considered in this case 2 1 formulation and solution of the diffraction problem by a multi body arrangement the complete solution of the hydrodynamic diffraction problem by arrays of multiple circular truncated cylinders using the matched eigenfunction expansion technique combined with the direct method of approach for the numerical implementation has been thoroughly described in chatjigeorgiou 2018a and chatjigeorgiou et al 2019 for the consistence of the presentation and making the analysis self contained we outline herein the basic steps of the procedure the geometry of each cylinder q 1 q in the array defines two liquid regions the outer region a that extends to infinity and contains all other cylinders j q of the array and the lower region b below each cylinder using a local polar coordinate system r q θ q z fixed on the center of cylinder q the vertical z coordinate is common for all cylinders and it is assumed fixed on the bottom pointing vertically upwards the regions a and b are contained within r q b 0 θ q 2 π 0 z h and 0 r q b 0 θ q 2 π 0 z h 1 respectively the underlying boundary value problem which must be satisfied by the complex spatial velocity potential ϕ with respect to the local polar coordinate system r q θ q z of cylinder q is composed by the following set of equations 1 2 ϕ 0 r q b 0 θ q 2 π 0 z h 2 k ϕ ϕ z 0 r q b 0 θ q 2 π z h 3 ϕ z 0 r q b 0 θ q 2 π z 0 4 ϕ r q 0 r q b q 0 θ

laplace operator eqs 1 and 5 are the laplace equations eq 2 expresses the linearized combined kinematic and dynamic boundary condition on the undisturbed free surface eqs 3 and 6 are the kinematical bottom conditions eq 7 is the zero velocity condition on the underneath area of each cylinder while eq 4 is the neumann body condition on the impermeable wetted area of the q th cylinder since for each cylinder two liquid regions have been defined eqs 1 4 and eqs 5 7 should by satisfied by the discrete velocity potentials ϕ a and ϕ b describing the wave fields in regions a and b respectively the uniqueness of the solution requires matching the potentials ϕ a and ϕ b in the mutual surface boundary r q b 0 θ q 2 π and 0 z h 1 namely 8 ϕ a r q ϕ b r q r q b 0 θ q 2 π 0 z h 1 9 ϕ a ϕ b r q b 0 θ q 2 π 0 z h 1 eqs 8 and 9 express the continuity of the velocities and of the linear pressures or potentials respectively the velocity potential ϕ a is composed by the incident wave component ϕ i and the diffraction components that originate from all bodies in the array based on the above and by utilizing the principle of linear superposition the total velocity potential in the outer region a will read 10 ϕ a ϕ i j 1 q ϕ d j ϕ i ϕ d q j q q ϕ d j let us further assume a local cartesian coordinate system x q y q fixed on the symmetrical axis of the q th cylinder and a global cartesian coordinate system x y fixed on the sea bottom the incident wave potential ϕ i expressed with respect to x q y q is given by 11 ϕ i i g a ω cosh k 0 z cosh k 0 h λ q e i k 0 x q cos β y q sin β i g a ω cosh k 0 z cosh k 0 h λ q m e i m π 2 β j m k 0 r q e i m θ q where k 0 is the wavenumber β is the incident wave direction with respect to the horizontal x axis j m is the bessel function of the first kind with integer order m and λ q e i k 0 x q cos β y q sin β where x q and y q are the x y coordinates of the origin of x q y q in the global system x y in the following paragraphs all velocity potentials will be considered normalized by i g a ω regarding the diffraction components of the total velocity potential they should be properly behaved in the far field satisfying the sommerfeld radiation condition for outgoing waves at infinity thus the diffracted wave component ϕ d q associated with the q th cylinder will be given by 12 ϕ d q m n 0 c m n q e i m π 2 g m n q k m a n r q z n z z n h e i m θ q where g m n q i m a n b k m a n b and i m k m denote the modified bessel functions of the first and the second kind respectively the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the argument the eigenvalues a n are obtained by the solution of the transcendental equation 13 k a n tan a n h 0 while the eigenfunctions z n z associated with a n are given by 14 z n z 1 2 1 sinh 2 k 0 h 2 k 0 h 1 2 cosh k 0 z n 0 1 2 1 sin 2 α n h 2 α n h 1 2 cos a n z n 1 2 3 the eigenfunctions z n z are orthogonal in z 0 h and the normalization constant is equal to h c m n q q 1 q are the unknown expansion coefficients which are obtained by employing the neumann condition eq 4 and the continuity relations eqs 8 and 9 the expression in eq 12 unifies the solution of the diffracted wave component incorporating both the wavenumber and the evanescent modes assuming the convention a 0 i k 0 eq 12 satisfies eqs 1 3 while in addition it complies with the sommerfeld radiation condition since the second independent radial solution depending on i m a n r q has been omitted the sum term in eq 10 that describes the diffracted wave field induced by all bodies in the array except cylinder q should be regarded as an incident wave field with complicated structure that hits the cylinder q moreover eq 10 combines all local polar coordinate systems r j θ j j 1 q for employing the neumann condition of eq 4 and the continuity relations of eqs 8 and 9 the various diffraction components for j q initially expressed in terms of the local system r j θ j j q should be expressed with respect to the local coordinate system r q θ q of the randomly selected cylinder q in the array to this end graf s addition theorem will be required which for the modified bessel function of the second kind and the hankel function of the first kind reads 15 k m a n r j e i m θ j s 1 s k m s a n r j q i s a n r q e i m s β j q e i s θ q r j q r q 16 h m k 0 r j e i m θ j s h m s k 0 r j q j s k 0 r q e i m s β j q e i s θ q r j q r q where r j q denotes the radial distance between the centres of cylinders j and q while β j q is the angle that is formed between the section r j q and the horizontal in the center of the cylinder j in fact eqs 15 and 16 correspond to the simplified formula of graf s addition theorem for bessel function for the general form of this addition theorem the interested reader is referred to the recent book of chatjigeorgiou 2018b eq 2 125 p 66 accordingly eq 10 obtains the following extended form that describes the infinite wave field outside the random cylinder q 17 ϕ a m

of the boundary conditions given by eqs 6 and 7 while the structure of ϕ b clearly satisfies the laplace equation eq 5 moreover ϕ b is bounded in the origin r q 0 since the second independent radial solution depending on k m which is singular for zero argument abramowitz and stegan eqs 9 6 8 and 9 6 9 p 375 has been omitted the solution given in eq 18 was properly constructed to yield finite values for n 0 and very large values of n otherwise eq 18 is always bounded given that in the lower liquid region r q b in eq 18 ε 0 1 and ε n 2 n 1 2 is the neumann symbol or jacobi factor while finally f m n q q 1 q denote the unknown expansion coefficients which are calculated together with c m n q q 1 q by invoking the neumann condition eq 4 and the continuity relations of eqs 8 and 9 the unknown expansion coefficients f m n q and c m n q q 1 q are obtained by utilizing the matched eigenfunctions technique chatjigeorgiou 2018a the final system is relatively complicated and its details are omitted at any rate the system is linear and can be put in a convenient complex matrix form to be solved using standard matrix techniques clearly the system must be truncated to account for a finite number of harmonics m m m and a finite number of vertical eigenfunctions n 0 n for both expressions 17 and 18 the number of modes and eigenfunctions depend on the accuracy of the convergence required typically a small number of modes and eigenfunctions less than five each is sufficient to provide convergent results having solved the diffraction problem the linear exciting forces are obtained by direct pressure integration on the wetted surface of the cylinders in the case of the surge and sway exciting forces the potential ϕ a eq 17 is employed while the heave exciting forces are calculated by utilizing the potential ϕ b eq 18 hence the surge f x q sway f y q and heave f z q exciting forces acting on the q th cylinder of the array are obtained by 19 f x q f y q ρ g a b h 1 h 0 2 π ϕ a b θ q z cos θ q sin θ q d θ q d z 20 f z q ρ g a 0 b 0 2 π ϕ b r q θ q h 1 r q d θ q d r q where ρ is the water density eqs 19 and 20 yield robust analytical formulas which however are relatively complicated and again their details are omitted full details of these formulas can be found in chatjigeorgiou 2018a and chatjigeorgiou et al 2019 the preceding analysis corresponds to an array of q cylinders without the presence of the wall isolated array the presence of a vertical bottom mounted wall is realized by the method of images mavrakos et al 2004 which immediately and unavoidably leads to the consideration of a pure wave reflection by a wall of infinite extent more specifically the problem under investigation fig 1 is considered equivalent to the hydrodynamic problem of the array of q cylinders and their images array of q virtual cylinders with respect to the vertical wall under the action of waves without the presence of the wall fig 2 the diffraction problem for the 2 q cylinders is then solved considering the action of two incident wave trains propagating at angles β and 180 o β with respect to the horizontal x axis fig 2 2 2 bie formulation the second approach taken in the present paper relies on the bie formulation of the velocity potential and is numerically realized using the code wamit 2006 which is employed for arbitrary shaped bodies hence a vertical wall of finite length can be incorporated into the array of the hydrodynamically interacting bodies the boundary value problem that is considered in the bie approach is composed by the laplace equation e g eq 1 in the entire volume of liquid on either side of the finite length wall the free surface condition eq 2 and the bottom condition eq 3 the cartesian representation of the incident wave component is taken from the first member of the right hand side of eq 11 while the neumann condition to be applied on the wetted surfaces of all bodies participating in the array including the wall will read 21 ϕ n 0 where the unit vector n is normal to each body s boundary and points out of the fluid domain it is noted that in the case of the bie formulation all equations are defined using a global coordinate system as shown in fig 1 but with its origin located on the free surface the boundary integral equations for the unknown diffraction velocity potential on the boundary of all bodies cylinders and wall are formed using the green s theorem and the boundary value problem is solved based on a three dimensional low order panel method lee and newman 2004 it is noted that since the thickness of the wall is negligible zero thickness dipole panels lee and newman 2004 are used for modelling the wetted surface of the wall finally the exciting forces are obtained via direct pressure integration on the wetted surfaces of all bodies q 1 q namely 22 f l q i ω ρ s b q n l ϕ d s l x y z where s b q is the wetted surface of the q th cylinder while n x n y and n z are the components of the normal vector n along the x y and z directions respectively the exciting forces acting on the wall can also be calculated in a similar manner it is finally mentioned that the version of wamit used in the present paper enables the consideration of an infinite length wall by utilizing the method of images only for the case of a single body this capability has been exploited for validating the present semi analytical formulation as described in the subsequent section 2 3 validation of the present semi analytical formulation the semi analytical formulation outlined in section 2 1 is validated for the case of a single cylinder by comparing results with the corresponding ones obtained using the bie formulation assuming the existence of an infinite length wall i e l w utilization of the method of images the cylinder has radius b 1 m non dimensional draft d b 2 while it is placed at non dimensional distance from the wall c b equal to 4 comparison is made in terms of the non dimensional sway f y and heave f z exciting forces values are normalized by ρ g a b 2 and ρ g a π b 2 respectively and the relevant results are shown in fig 3 it can be easily seen that the results of the present semi analytical formulation show an excellent agreement with the corresponding ones obtained using the bie formulation 3 results and discussion 3 1 general remarks the numerical methods outlined in section 2 are applied for the case of an array of five identical cylinders q 5 in fig 1 of radius b 1 m and of non dimensional draft d b 2 the cylinders are distributed uniformly within the array with non dimensional center to center spacing 2 l b 4 and non dimensional distance from the wall c b 4 in the case of the bie formulation four different values of non dimensional wall length l w b are examined equal to 18 36 72 and 108 if l 1 denotes the distance between the centres of the two outer cylinders in the array with the corresponding edges of the wall fig 1 the aforementioned l w b values correspond to l 1 b 1 10 28 and 46 respectively the array and the wall are considered in an area of non dimensional depth h b 10 and are subjected to monochromatic incident waves with β 270 o fig 1 the non dimensional wave number k 0 b varies between 0 01 and 4 0 in the case of the bie formulation the wetted surface of each cylinder was modeled using 1600 panels while the wall for all l w b values examined was modeled using 1600 dipole panels i e 9600 panels were considered in total the aforementioned number of panels has been defined based on appropriate convergence tests aiming at combing numerical accuracy with computational efficiency for 9600 panels in total the average computational time per wave number for achieving converge in the solution was equal to 107 s 166 s 170 s and 188 s for l w b 18 36 72 and 108 respectively using a standard pc with i7 7500u 2 7 ghz processor in the following subsections attention shall be given to a revealing the limitations of the method of images assumption of an infinite length wall and b investigating the effect of l w b on the exciting forces acting on the cylinders of the array results corresponding to an isolated array are also cited in order to illustrate more clearly the effect of the presence of the wall on the exciting forces exerted on the cylinders the surge and sway exciting forces are given normalized by ρ g a b 2 while the heave forces have been normalized by ρ g a π b 2 it is also noted that the abbreviations cyl1 cyl2 cyl5 fig 1 are used for denoting the cylinders in the array with cyl3 being the middle cylinder of the array while the symmetry of the array with respect to the examined incident wave direction leads to the same exiting forces for cyl1 and cyl5 outer cylinders and for cyl2 and cyl4 3 2 exciting forces on the cylinders for the infinite wall case in figs 4 11 the surge f x sway f y and heave f z exciting forces on the cylinders of the array are calculated analytically assuming l w method of images those are compared with the corresponding results obtained via the bie formulation for the case of a finite length wall of l w b 18 and l w b 108 starting with the surge forces figs 4 5 non zero values of f x exist for cylq q 1 2 4 and 5 as a result of the hydrodynamic interactions among the cylinders and between the wall and the cylinders while due to the symmetry of the configuration with respect to β 270 o f x for cyl3 is cancelled for all l w cases considered and for all cylq q 1 2 4 and 5 an intense variation of f x relative to the nondimensional wave number is observed which is characterized by an irregular pattern and the existence of multiple sharp peaks and successive local minima especially up to k 0 b 2 the results for the surge force obtained for the case of the infinite wall agree quite well with the corresponding results for l w b 108 which represents a wall of large length with large outer cylinder s center to wall s edge distance l 1 b 46 it should be remarked however that differences do exist even when assuming a lengthy but not actually infinite wall since in the former case and contrary to l w wall edge effects still exist it is therefore evident that the infinite wall assumption simulated by the method of images should be used with absolute care for the case of l w b 18 the edge finite length effects of the small length wall with l 1 b 1 have a direct impact on f x leading therefore to significant differences in the variation pattern and the values of f x compared e g to the case of the infinite l w especially within the intervals 0 01 k 0 b 1 3 for cylq q 1 and q 5 fig 4 and at 0 01 k 0 b 2 0 for cylq q 2 and q 4 fig 5 regarding sway exciting forces figs 6 8 for all l w cases considered herein and for all cylq q 1 5 the variation pattern for f y is characterized by the existence of five successive peaks at k 0 b 0 4 1 1 2 0 2 8 and 3 5 respectively with successively decreasing values towards higher frequencies the overall trends between finite and infinite vertical wall cases are similar for the sway forces for the inner cylinders of the array i e cylq q 2 3 and 4 figs 7 8 the infinite wall assumption does not lead to significant differences for sway forces compared to both l w 18 and l w 108 same conclusions can be drawn for the outer cylinders of the array fig 6 but only for the large length case for the small length case wall edge effects seem to have an impact on f y for the case of cyl1 and cyl5 and for k 0 b 1 5 where smaller peak values for l w b 18 are observed compared to the infinite wall the heave exciting forces figs 9 11 exhibit very interesting characteristics wall reflections induce significant effects on f z for all cylq q 1 5 and for all l w cases considered in the interval 0 01 k 0 b 1 0 while at k 0 b 1 0 f z becomes practically zero in the case of the infinite l w f z from the maximum value of 2 at k 0 b 0 01 decreases smoothly up to k 0 b 0 35 where it obtains a local minimum with a value almost equal to zero a small increase of f z follows resulting to non zero f z values up to k 0 b 1 0 it is worth to note that the existence of the maximum value of 2 at k 0 b 0 01 is related to the assumption of pure wave reflection by the infinite length wall this is not observed for the cases of l w b 18 and 108 where a finite length wall as exists in practical real world applications has been taken into account specifically for l w b 18 and contrary to the infinite l w the variation of f z starts from the limiting value of 1 at k 0 b 0 01 as in the case of the isolated array see figs 17 a 19a below and it is characterized by a smooth increase up to k 0 b 0 15 where the peak of f z occurs this behaviour leads in turn to a smaller f z values for cylq q 1 5 at 0 01 k 0 b 0 1 and b larger f z values for cylq q 2 3 and 4 at 0 1 k 0 b 0 3 compared to the case of the infinite l w on the other hand for l w b 108 and again contrary to the infinite l w f z is characterized by the occurrence of two successive peaks at 0 01 k 0 b 0 6 the first one global maximum is observed at k 0 b 0 03 as a result of the rapid increase of f z from the value of 1 25 at k 0 b 0 01 while the second peak local maximum occurs at k 0 b 0 15 subsequently larger f z values especially at 0 02 k 0 b 0 1 are observed for cylq q 1 5 compared to the case of the infinite l w for the rest examined k 0 b range the variation of f z for each cylinder in the array and for both l w b 18 and 108 is analogous with the variation of the corresponding heave exciting force obtained for the case of the infinite l w according to the preceding discussion it could be said that the infinite wall assumption exhibits limitations regarding the accurate estimation of the cylinders heave exciting forces in the low frequency range since the assumption of a pure wave reflecting wall of infinite length leads to under or over estimation of the aforementioned physical quantities additionally the assumption of an infinite length wall seems not to be adequate for the calculation of the horizontal forces in the case of small length vertical walls with small l 1 b ratios where edge effects significantly affect the cylinders surge exciting forces as well as the sway exciting forces on the outer cylinders of the array 3 3 the effect of wall s length on the exciting forces acting on the cylinders the effect of l w b on the exciting forces applied on the cylinders of the array is discussed with the aid of figs 12 and 13 and 14a 19a which depict the variation of f x f y and f z obtained by the bie formulation as a function of k 0 b for l w b 18 36 72 and 108 in these figures results corresponding to an isolated array are also shown for demonstrating more clearly the effect of the presence of the wall on the cylinders exciting forces for all l w b cases examined the hydrodynamic interactions among the cylinders of the array and between the cylinders and the wall lead to non zero surge exciting forces for cylq q 1 2 4 and 5 figs 12 and 13 which vary following a profound irregular pattern the significant impact of the wall edge effects on the surge exciting forces for l w b 18 leads to a different variation and largest peak values of f x at 0 01 k 0 b 1 0 for cylq q 1 and 5 fig 12 and at 0 01 k 0 b 2 0 for cylq q 2 and 4 fig 13 compared to the rest l w b ratios examined herein furthermore the increase of l w b from 36 to 108 leads to a small decrease of the f x peak values at 0 01 k 0 b 1 6 mainly for the outer cylinders of the array fig 12 while the opposite holds true for the largest examined k 0 b values finally compared to the isolated cylinder for all cylq q 1 2 4 and 5 and for all l w b values examined a more intense variation of f x as a function of k 0 b is observed demonstrating the impact of the presence of the wall and of the wall edge effects on the surge exciting forces moving on to the sway exciting forces figs 14a 16 a it can be seen that the increase of l w b has an insignificant effect on the values and the variation pattern of f y for the inner cylinders of the array cylq q 2 3 and 4 figs 15a 16a this also holds true for the outer cylinders cylq q 1 and 5 fig 14 a except for the case of l w b 18 for this l w b value the existence of a small center to wall edge distance l 1 b 1 leads to smaller peak values of f y at k 0 b 1 5 compared to the rest l w b cases contrary the isolated array where for each cylq q 1 5 f y varies smoothly the presence of the wall irrespectively of its length leads to an intense variation pattern of the sway exciting forces characterized by the existence of multiple distinctive local minima at k 0 b 0 85 1 5 2 4 3 2 and 4 and thus of multiple peaks at k 0 b 0 4 1 1 2 0 2 8 and 3 5 with successively decreasing values towards higher frequencies recalling that c denotes the distance between the centres of the cylinders and the wall fig 1 the non dimensional wave numbers where the aforementioned local minima occur correspond to characteristic values of the c l ratio with l being the wave length approximately equal to 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 respectively from a physical point of view the f y local minima can be related to the formation of characteristic patterns of the diffracted wave field around the cylinders at these c l values as commended in the next section regarding the heave exciting forces figs 17a 19 a for all cylinders of the array the change of l w b has a significant effect on f z at 0 01 k 0 b 0 2 for l w b 18 the variation of f z begins from the limiting value of 1 at k 0 b 0 01 as in the case of the isolated array and it is characterized by a smooth increase up to k 0 b 0 15 where the peak of f z occurs then f z decreases smoothly up to k 0 b 0 35 where it obtains a local minimum with value close to zero the same variation pattern is observed for the rest examined l w b cases however by increasing successively the length of the wall a more rapid increase of f z at k 0 b 0 2 is observed therefore the f z peak is successively shifted to smaller frequencies i e at k 0 b 0 1 0 04 and 0 03 for l w b 36 72 and 108 respectively moreover for l w b 108 and contrary to the rest l w b cases a local maximum occurs at k 0 b 0 15 it should be also noted that the increase of l w b leads to larger f z peak values finally the results of figs 17 a 19a demonstrate clearly that the presence of the wall irrespectively of its length affects significantly the heave exciting forces of all the cylinders in the array at 0 01 k 0 b 1 0 since in this frequency range and for all l w b values examined f z does not show the continuous smooth decrease as in the case of the isolated array overall the heave exciting forces should be examined and discussed relative to the limiting value for zero wave frequency for isolated cylinders or for an isolated array without the effect of reflections by a wall the limiting value using the present normalization which is of hydrostatic nature tends to unity subsequently it drops rapidly until is practically cancelled the existence of an infinite wall induces a pure reflection generating a non travelling wave with double amplitude and accordingly provokes double amplitude heave forces again at the zero frequency limiting case given that no pure reflection should be expected in real world applications having a double amplitude vertical hydrodynamic load should be considered as a course approximation for finite length walls the heave forces on the cylinders should start from the hydrostatic unity as indeed is implied in figs 17 a 19a nonetheless the waves diffracted by the wall induce profound amplifications of the heave loads which for lengthy walls e g l w b 108 exceed the hydrostatic double amplitude and reach the value of 2 5 the same behaviour is observed for more realistic situations e g l w b 18 where the heave force is increased above 1 5 of π ρ g a b 2 it is mentioned that the heave forces amplification interval involves productive wave frequencies as well e g 0 5 k 0 b 1 0 different array configurations may result in stronger force magnifications implying that the wec concept in front of a vertical wall represents a problem of optimization in terms of the number of solids the configuration of the array the relative placements and obviously the involved dimensions accordingly the existence of a wall in front of an array of point absorbers could be an effective mechanism for enhancing wave energy harvesting finally considering the phases of the cylinders exciting forces figs 14 b 16b and 17b 19b show indicatively the variation of the phases of f y and f z receptively obtained by the bie formulation as a function of k 0 b for l w b 18 36 72 and 108 it can be seen that the change of l w b has an insignificant effect on the phases of f y figs 14 b 16b while this change affects the phases of f z figs 17 b 19b mainly at k 0 b 2 0 depending upon the position of the cylinder in the array on the other hand the presence of the wall irrespectively of its length affects the phases of the sway and the heave exciting forces of all the cylinders since contrary to the case of the isolated array a more intense variation of the aforementioned quantities is observed 3 4 wave filed spatial variation for physically interpreting the occurrence of local minima in the case of the sway exciting forces figs 14 a 16a the spatial variation of the nondimensional wave elevation η α is considered specifically figs 20 and 21 show the η α spatial variation for l w b 18 and l w b 72 respectively calculated indicatively at two characteristics k 0 b values equal to 0 85 and 1 1 where the sway exciting forces of the cylinders obtain a local minimum and a local maximum respectively figs 14 a 16a for both examined l w b cases η α at k 0 b 1 1 figs 20 b and 21b varies intensively and has significant values along two distinctive longitudinal parallel to the wall zones located at the leeward and the seaward side of the cylinders however this is not observed for the case of k 0 b 0 85 figs 20 a and 21a where the existence of an incident wave corresponding to c l 0 5 leads to a diffracted wave field governed by an intense variation and maximum η α values mainly in the area confined between the cylinders of the array moreover for this k 0 b value the diffracted wave field in the area close to array i e 3 0 y 5 0 is almost symmetric for the inner cylinders cylq q 2 3 and 4 and for the outer cylinders in the case of l w b 72 with respect to their local x q axis the above advocate the existence of quite small f y values at k 0 b 0 85 contrary to the case of k 0 b 1 1 in absolute accord with the results of figs 14 a 16a finally compared to the isolated array fig 22 it is evident that for a given k 0 b value and for both l w b 18 and 72 the presence of the wall has a significant effect on the wave field leading to a totally different and more intense spatial variation of η α around the cylinders of the array 4 conclusions in the present paper the hydrodynamic behaviour of a linear array of mutually interacting truncated circular cylinders in front of a bottom mounted finite length vertical wall of negligible thickness is analysed in the frequency domain under the action of perpendicular monochromatic incident waves the diffraction problem is solved by utilizing two different approaches a semi analytical formulation which by default assumes a pure wave reflecting wall of infinite length method of images and a conventional bie formulation where finite length wall effects are taken into account focus is given on a revealing the limitations of the infinite wall concept on the calculation of the exciting forces acting on the cylinders of the array and b investigating the effect of l w b on the aforementioned physical quantities the main conclusions of the present investigation are the assumption of a pure wave reflecting wall of infinite length leads to an under or over estimation of the cylinders heave exciting forces at k 0 b 0 4 compared to the case where a finite length wall as exists in practical real world applications is taken into account thus the infinite wall concept shows limitations regarding the accurate estimation of the aforementioned physical quantities at small wave numbers the assumption of a pure wave reflecting infinite length seems not to be adequate for the calculation of the horizontal exciting forces in the presence of small length vertical walls with small outer cylinder s center to wall s edge distance where finite length effects have a significant impact on the cylinders surge exciting forces and the sway exciting forces of the array s outer cylinders for all l w b cases examined the surge exciting forces resulting from the hydrodynamic interactions among the cylinders of the array and between the cylinders and the wall show a profound irregular variation the change of l w b affects all cylinders surge exciting forces with the most significant differences observed for the smallest examined l w b value since in that case the existence of small outer cylinder s center to wall s edge distance leads to substantial wall edge effects compared to the isolated array the presence of a vertical bottom mounted finite length boundary in the leeward area of the array amplifies the hydrodynamic interactions within the array the change of l w b has an insignificant effect on the values and the variation pattern of the sway exciting forces for almost all the cylinders in the array contrary to the case of the isolated array the presence of the wall irrespectively of its length leads to an intense variation pattern of the cylinders sway exciting forces characterized by a continuous alternation of local maxima and minima the latter local minima occur at characteristic values of the c l ratio between the cylinders centres to wall distance and the incident wave length approximately equal to 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 at these c l values an intense spatial variation of the wave field in the area confined between the cylinders is observed while the wave field in the seaward and leeward sides of the cylinders shows symmetrical features with regard to the cylinders heave exciting forces the presence of the wall irrespectively of its length and again contrary to the isolated array leads to occurrences of peaks with values larger than 1 at k 0 b 0 01 as well as to amplifications of the heave exciting forces at specific wave number intervals up to k 0 b 1 0 the effect of l w b on the heave exciting forces is bounded at 0 01 k 0 b 0 2 where by increasing successively the length of the wall a more rapid increase of f z is observed leading therefore to a successive shift of the f z peak at smaller non dimensional wave numbers the present research can be further extended in order to examine the hydrodynamic behaviour of an array of heaving floating cylinders in front of a vertical bottom mounted wall of finite length the array s power absorption ability taking into account the motion phase differences among the cylinders as well as the potential of the occurrence of wave trapping phenomena the consideration of different than the linear array configurations of the cylinders in front of a wall and the determination of the optimum in terms of power absorption configuration present also interesting subjects for future investigation
